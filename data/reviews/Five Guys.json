{"text":"Five Guys FTW!!  This place is pretty amaaaa-ZING! 

We usually get the bacon cheeseburger (I order the \"little\" since two patties on the \"regular\" would be too much for me).  I love the FREE toppings you get which include grilled mushrooms and onions.  I always  order mine with extra mushrooms as I am a mushroom feign.  They also pile on the bacon which is awesome since most places gimp you on that.  Their bacon cheese dog is also delicious.  I just wish they had sport peppers.  Oh well, you can't win them all.  

Their cajun fries are also a must!  I'm not a big french fry fan (especially the thick cut kind), but the fries here are to die for!  The cajun fries are extra addicting (which is probably why they have such generous portions).  

This place does not fail to disappoint and has grown to be our go-to place for burgers."}
{"text":"I go here for the fries. If you were raised on potatoes, like me, some days, all you want is fucking potatoes fried. The large portion is enough for two, so you can take some home and pull them (use a knife if your a girl) apart and fry them up with some eggs for breakfast. The other stuff is just that, nothing fancy, yet I still don't know how peanuts fit into it all. Only downside of this location is the MEGA-FLIES. I counted an average of four on my table all the time. Since I was alone, if you looked at me from afar, I looked like one of the Mill Avenue homeless, thrashing about in the corner, complete with brown bag (fries). Its worth to me."}
{"text":"I love coming here great food and great employees. Always putting a smile on my face when I come in they are in such a good mood. Love being in an environment where people love their jobs"}
{"text":"Been to the one on South Beach, and the burgers and fries are just as good here!  My only complaint is I asked for ketchup, and they absolutely drenched the burger! (eeew).  After scraping off a 1/4c of ketchup the burger was fantastic, much, much better than In and Out Burger.  I did remember to order the regular fries (which is enough for a family with small children).   The fries here are the BEST!  Nice to see an alternative to In and Out Burger.  I think the burger and fries at Five Guys Rock!"}
{"text":"The search for the best burger - 2011 Review #2.
A lot of fanfare goes with this joint. Mostly from the US. I got the banquet burger. One patty with bacon. It was thin and overdone. The buns are toasted. YEAH. The Cajun fries are horrible and the regular fries are ok. Will somebody please educate burger joints on double frying. The only consolation is free refills, unless you order take out. I won't be going back. Look for review #3. Still searching."}
{"text":"It's way over priced for what you get.  The burgers are good the frys are soggy and undercooked and they're not shoe-string like advertised.  You can go to Hamburger Works and the best burger in Phoenix.  You can get a \"great big one\" with everything including a large 1/2 pound of fresh beef for much less than 5 guys charges.  I also didn't like having to buy frys for 2 for $3.00.  A small burger, frys and a drink cost almost $13.  I tried it once but I won't go back."}
{"text":"Overrated. I can't imagine going out of my way to eat here again. And $10 is cheap but not that cheap."}
{"text":"The manager screams at customers. Stay away and go to Johnny Rockets in the same food court."}
{"text":"It's ok for a burger place I'm not overly fond of eating out of a brown bag.it's way to loud and between the loud music and the yelling it makes for eating with someone difficult .The burger it's self was good but Smash Burger is by far a better burger and dining experience"}
{"text":"Awesome cheeseburgers and Cajun fries!! Amazing shakes as well. Little loud atmosphere but well worth it for sure. In the heart of busy downtown. It's always busy and the staff is super friendly and very upbeat and helpful. I would recommend ANYTHING on their menu. I love this place. Always happy and have had great food, great service and a great experience."}
{"text":"The people here are incredibly friendly and the food is superb. Five guys in Fairlawn is our goto \"what do you want for dinner\" answer."}
{"text":"Disappointed in my visit to this Five Guys.  Ordered Bacon Cheese Burger and small Fry with drink that tallied $14.  Got my order and after initial inspection, noticed there was only one patty rather than the two expected in my order.  (even as I type this, I feel as if I'm turning into some Austin Powers \"Fat Bastard\"creature complaining that I did not get my full fat intake...an slapping my belly while doing so)

Purely from a financial perspective, I brought this to the counter attendant's attention who was super apologetic.  The grill guy overheard the exchange and was also super accommodating offering to remake the order.  All I really wanted was credit for my order to return the $1 difference between the regular hamburger (2 patty) and little hamburger (1 patty).

The counter attendant said she had to get the manager.  After waiting for about 10 minutes, the manager strolled over to my table to ask if everything was ok.  Perhaps maybe the counter attendant briefed her on the situation..nahh.

I explained the situation and said all I really wanted was $1 back to make it even.  She offered instead to \"take care of my next time I was in\".  Um..not sure what that entailed but pressed on with my $1 refund.  After another 15 minutes, she returned with $3.  I insisted that I only wanted $1 but she stayed firm at $3.  

Anyhow, my experience rating is largely due to my error in order but also the weird refund acrobatics that were apparently required.   

The hamburger wasn't worth the $7 either."}
{"text":"Eh, Its 12 bucks for a small cheeseburger and little fries and a drink. If you get a double, larger fries you're looking at 15. Its pricey. It takes 7-8 minutes to get your burger and sometimes you wait 3-4 min in line. I started going to Charlies next door since its about half the price for cheese steaks and fries."}
{"text":"In my opinion it may be the best burger and frys I have had. The cheese is always perfectly melted and the jalape√±os I get are always tasting fresh. They have cool touch screen soda machines where you can add different flavors to any soda. My only complaint it the prices. It is a little pricy but worth it in my opinion"}
{"text":"IDK what all the hype is about... burgers are average... they load you up with fries.. which is nice. soda machine is cool. but a meal with the smallest fries and JR burger + small soda; and we're looking at a $11 lunch... 
way over priced IMO"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time definitely coming back burgers are juicy and delicious and the soda machine is my favorite"}
{"text":"Kalila was not excited to go to FIVE GUYS, because she has had it in New Jersey and New York in the past and wasn't that impressed. It was my first time, so we went.

I ordered a cheeseburger (2 patties) with american cheese, jalepenos, green peppers, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, lettuce, ketchup, and maybe more. Forgot already. Anyways, it was delicious and I loved it. Every bite was an adventure.

Kalila ordered a little cheeseburger with mayo, lettuce, mushrooms and A1 steak sauce. They forgot her A1. That definitely didn't help her opinion of the place. She was still unimpressed with her burger. She won't stop telling me about how amazing Shake Shack in NYC is. She compares EVERY burger to them. 

We agree that the employee who took our order was very nice. She offered us a side of cajun powder so that we didn't have to order both regular and cajun fries.

Five Guys offer free peanuts and they have futuristic soda machines. Once you select a drink, such as lemonade, it changes to the different kinds of lemonade to choose from! We thought we'd get lemonade and then all of a sudden we got strawberry lemonade! It was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"So . . . this place certainly has a lot of buzz and I was relatively excited to check it out. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. I had to laugh upon walking in - they offer peanuts while waiting in what was a prodigious line - we arrived at 1230 on a thursday - and they had a sign warning patrons not to leave with the peanuts due to allergy concerns. This was a deviously clever sign despite the obvious failure in logic because I spent the 10 minutes in line trying to figure out how that didn't apply to people IN the restaurant. It went by pretty quickly.

I ordered the cheeseburger with \"everything.\" Plus jalapenos. Paired it with the cajun fries. It was aggressively mediocre. The fries were lukewarm and soggy, and the \"cajun\" was evidently just a healthy dousing of lawry's seasoning salt. At least that was how it tasted to me. They also couldn't seem to conquer the common burger problem of the soggy lower bun. Mine was like a wet sponge. The flavor was decent, though. 

The biggest problem I had was the crowd and the noise. We had to wait to find a seat, and then got the ass and the cock bump numerous times from other patrons snaking through the tables to get their food or refill their drinks. Every thirty seconds some poor soul would scream an order number out at the top of their lungs, causing another rush to the counter. I won't go back. I like In-n-Out."}
{"text":"This is my favourite burger joint around. Delicious! The lil hamburger is not that small, regular has two patties for you newbies. About a 5 min wait for it but worth while, free peanuts and the fries are portioned well. Where is the gravy tho?"}
{"text":"Overpriced, over rated. The burger wasn't good, the fries were limp.  I will never go back.  In-n-out for me..."}
{"text":"Of all the burger places in the area, this is my favorite. Love all the toppings and the freshness of the burger.  I know everyone raves about the fries & I have to agree. What's makes them taste so great is the freshness...their kind of old-fashioned in the way that they are like home made. They are amazing. I do think this place is a little pricey. 30bucks for burgers fries & drinks is a lot for 2 people.  But I guess that's how it is these days...at least it tastes great!  My only complaint about this location is the customer service.  They people aren't overly friendly or welcoming...they have a job to do & they do it. Nothing terrible or overly rude, but I like a smile with my meal."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great service.  They messed up our order once and made it right buy paying for our next meal and a milkshake. .. friendly staff... very impressed! 
# delicious #burgerandfries"}
{"text":"Awesome burger and fries. I think one of the best burgers I have had!!!  I liked the free toppings. I think it is better than in and out burger.  There was someone cleaning the dining room the whole time.  I like when they keep a place clean. 
I do think the volume of the workers was a little loud, competing with the radio.   I would give it five stars if the there was less shouting. Regardless of the noise,  We will be back for the great burger."}
{"text":"Very dissappointed after all the 2nd hand hype..... The Burgers and fries LOOK great when served....but are very bland....The peanuts taste better than the burger. In the end I put this chain in somewhere between In N out and a Wendy's...with In N Out getting the edge. Definetly not worth the wait you see at lunch time...Better off going to red robins or grabbing a 5 dollar burger at Carls Jr. Soooo much grease/oil....soooo little taste!"}

{"text":"For burgers and fries this place deserves a five star rating. The flavor is delicious and the topping selection is great for the price. The service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times over the past few years. This place is good, but it has a few annoying qualities.

Pros:

The food is delicious. The prices are reasonable. The staff is friendly and efficient.  Also, the free peanuts are a plus.

Cons:

The buns at this location taste weird. I've eaten at other Five Guys locations and the buns at this one just plain taste weird. I don't know why.

The tables are dirty. I don't like sitting down to a table smeared with someone else's cheeseburger-grease. This, plus the loud crappy music being blasted, means I'm not taking anyone here for a date, or on any kind of business lunch.

It's dumb that they serve all hamburgers in a brown paper bag. I know it's probably part of some silly tradition, but the bag means that the tables get messy because you have to rip open the bag and grease goes everywhere. Also, the fries and bun get soggy inside the bag.  Note: this does not happen on a McDonald's tray.

If the restaurant would change its dumb, backwards policy of serving all food in ghetto paper bags and the workers would wipe down the tables more than once a year, this place would be a five-star restaurant, easy."}
{"text":"Quick burgers done very simply and well. As one reviewer mentioned they do use peanut oil. I don't think that should get them down rated they have it posted clearly for people to see. But if you have a nut allergy I'd be cautious. My friend is normally allergic to nuts but seems to be fine with the food here.

Place is in a good location, clean every time I've been, nice staff, and good food. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Any chance to eat at Five guys and I'm all over it. This is probably one of the friendliest ones I've been to. The nice lady pleasantly took my order, let me know that my military ID allowed me a free drink. . 

The food wasn't rushed and when I did eat it things were fresh. Burger was cooked just right and the fries were HOT!  

Overall great experience, good job!"}
{"text":"Customer service is amazing and the food is great. The staff was constantly asking how I was and if they could help me."}
{"text":"As I continue to try and find my favorite burger in my new home of Cleveland, Five Guys happened to be near where I was one evening when the hankering hit me.  I was totally amped to enjoy what I'd heard to be one of, if not the best, fast food burgers in the land.

  I got the standard cheeseburger, which has been noted, is really two patties, and got all the condiments except mushrooms.  Had to check out the cajun fries as well.  Was a little thrown off by my total, but when I got the bag of food I saw that you do get a large amount for it.

  I really wish I could say I liked it more and that it was mindblowing, but it was a very pedestrian, run of the mill burger.  Not much seasoning to the meat, and generally lacked any oomph.  The cajun fries were decent, but I'm not going to be making a trip back here just for that.  I guess that leaves the In-N-Out and Fatburger as the elusive \"best fast food burger\" I've yet to try."}
{"text":"Just don't see how they'll survive...many better burgers and fries in the neighborhood and very expensive in addition to uncomfortable seating and blazing lighting....aaaarrrrrgghh"}
{"text":"This location has been so fast and friendly since it opened. Love their cheese burgers and Cajun fries."}
{"text":"Yes, the burgers are very good, but this place's reputation is just hype. Their prices are WAY too high for a burger joint, and honestly, they aren't much better than McDonalds or Burger King.  I mean, if you're at the mall and are hungry for a burger, go ahead & give this place a try, but don't go out of your way for it."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Our family (with a toddler) came in from Northern California and had business in downtown Phoenix. We LOVED this place! No line, friendly service, burgers were big and you can load them up with no extra charge. We got the large fries - boardwalk style w/ malt vinegar available - and the whole family didn't finish them. Sat outside and listened to classic rock, enjoyed the view, and even the clients eating outside were friendly to us."}
{"text":"I don't like chain restaurants because I like to support local businesses whenever possible, but I kept hearing about this place, so I tried it. And....there's a reason these are popping up all over. It was the best burger I've had in Charlotte. Nothing much to write about the chain-y decor or strip mall location, but they make a damn fine, greasy, tall, made-to-order burger quickly and with no-nonsense. Well done 5 gents"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger places to go and eat at . 
I am not a big burger person in the first place but the burgers there are amazing . I would have to say my favorite thing about there burgers is that you can pick whatever you want on it and the price doesn't change and they always taste so fresh and amazing . The French fries are always so nice , ready and hot . My favorite fries are the cajan fries if you like just that little bit of spice they are perfect with the burger . The location is great , nice and clean. Not to mention everyone there is always so friendly, fast and down to earth . The one thing I love the most is that it actually looks like they enjoy being there . :) I love that ! So anyways great place to go eat , meet friends and chill on the weekend or even after school ! So enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Best fast food burgers you can get ANYWHERE. I spent the summer in CA and had In n Out Burger a few times, and there's no comparison. The toppings and fries make it the best. Load up your burger fo' free."}
{"text":"I have been twice. 
The first time I had a burger and fries. Be forewarned, a small burger is all you need. Portion sizes are large. The last time I went I had the grilled veggie sandwich with cheese and shared a large fries with three friends.
Overall they have a good selection of toppings which is a big reason I like burgers."}
{"text":"As always everything was AWESOME! I have had their burger & their cheeseburger. I decided to try a bacon burger. I didn't know it was a double patty! Holy cow!  That was a lot of food! With the burger & small fries (you HAVE to have the fries) I was stuffed!  While you wait, don't forget to have some peanut!"}
{"text":"I had very high hopes and it passed the test. Lil' Cheeseburger is more than enough food for most people, it's really not lil' at all. Beef is very fresh and tasty. The bun is soft and stands out compared to most. I'm also a sucker for American cheese on a burg. Melty goodness.

Both types of fries were a bit disappointing but I would definitely choose regular over cajun in future. 

A welcome US chain doing burgers properly."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place!! I love the free peanuts lol!! The burgers are really moist and juicy!! Perfect for my hubby lol!"}
{"text":"Heard so much about 5 guys and I don't understand the hype. Average and expensive for nothing!! $9 for a cheeseburger with bacon - ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"Yikes, talk about expensive fast food.  No combo meals here. Everything is sold separately, so I spent $21. on 2 people w/out dessert. This is just another greasy burger joint. No big deal. Still sticking with In n Out."}
{"text":"Went in to get a burger...they completely over cooked it....and ask for cooked onions....and got raw onions on the over cooked burger. Went up to the counter to see about fixing the situation...and get this....this \"female \" (i think it was female) \"manager\" said....and I quote her exactly ....\"If your so unhappy,  don't come back\"...WOW!!!  Take advice from someone who enjoys a good burger and DON'T GO TO FIVE GUYS IN LAS VEGAS ON FLAMINGO....the \"management is unprofessional and the food is dry and they don't take your order correctly. In a nutshell...they suck!"}
{"text":"I have eaten in a lot of Five Guys.  This one, in my neighborhood, is at least as good as any I have visited.  Lots of more ambitious sit-down restaurants try to sell fancy hamburgers, fries, etc., but in my opinion, none of their burgers are as good as Five Guys."}
{"text":"After hearing how great the food is at Five Guys, We decided to try the one in Surprise.
The place was packed, Had to stand in line for 20 minutes.
 We ordered two regular cheese burgers with drinks and fries. We waited another 10 minutes while they filled the order.
 Wow what a HUGE Disappointment the burgers where raw  and super greasy.The buns where smashed flat like someone stood on them.
The fries were cold , soggy an came in a grease soaked paper bag. Absolutely the worst I have ever had. Also it was very expensive over $20 for two people.

We will probably never go back, I took my food back and asked for them to remake it properly. The Manager told me that there were orders ahead of us and it would be 30 more minutes before they could remake the order.
 He also told me that's the way they cook all the food and he did not think there was anything wrong with our raw , soggy food.
 I that point I had all of this place i could stand,I just got my money back and we left."}
{"text":"Nice burger for a change!  The food here is very good and atypical of a fast food burger. The fries are very good and an enormous portion. Good job!"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers I've had yet. The fact its a chain usually means that hat standards will drop sooner or later, so enjoy it while you can. They have a wide selection of toppings for your burger and unlimited peanuts while you wait. The Cajun fries were my biggest surprise. I would go just for the Cajun fries. The only downfall was probably the waiting time, a bit longer then anticipated but well worth it"}
{"text":"We've always had friendly service here and our order is always correct. The burgers always taste great. The portion size of their fries is huge but the quality isn't great. They're usually on the soggy and warm side instead of hot and crispy. If the fries were continuously good I'd have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"burgers are too good, like home made style, cooked right in front of you and made to order, the fries are awesome too, free peanuts while you wait, even though I don't eat em ha"}
{"text":"I missed the memo that the burgers not designated as little are actually doubles.  So, I've now eaten my first ever double cheeseburger.  Good thing I was starving.  On a normal day, I'll have to remember to get the \"Little Cheeseburger\".  The cajun fries have a little bit of a kick... nothing crazy, just a little flavor.  The thing that I was most entertained by was the super awesome digital Coke fountain machine.  There must've been at least 50 different flavors of Coke products, many of which I've never heard of like Raspberry Coke or Orange Coke."}
{"text":"The best fries ever.  EVER.  

One of my kids doesn't even like fries (how can you not like fries?) but he'll eat the ones from here.

I don't even really eat beef - unless I come here.  I can't have wheat, but I just get it lettuce wrapped and have never had a problem.  The rest of my family can eat wheat (I am so jealous) and they all love the food from here.  

While we usually get it to go since we live close by, we all go to order because of their fun soda machine, and the free roasted peanuts that you can eat while waiting."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best burgers you will ever experience. Any location is worth visiting. Noise is ridiculous, but the burgers are incomparable. If you liike truly savory cheeseburgers, this is THE place. Ever order made fresh and however you want it. The big name fast food places are good, this is spectacular!"}
{"text":"Cheeseburger and fries were delicious! 
Prices are seasonable for the size of the burger and all the condiment options to choose from. 
Service was great! Friendly and helpful staff. 
Clean seating areas inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"When my parents told me this place was amazing. I knew it would have to be to please them. They were right,  five guys has delicious burgers and the fries just taste like real potatoes so that is always a plus!  Service was really good and they more options for toppings then most other places. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting.  The fries are soggy, the burger buns are soggy, the cheese isn't even melted. I'll stick to in n out"}
{"text":"Great burgers, fantastic fries, but you have to take it to go from this particular location. The barking the tiny cashiers do is ear splitting. When asked why they yell, they give you a cold stare, blink once and take it up several octaves while their fingers edge up the volume on the music. The place is clean, the complimentary peanuts a great while wait treat. If still want to choose this location over others, bring along some ear plugs."}
{"text":"Just an average burger.  Maybe my expectations were too high after reading reviews.  Very disappointed!  Found them to be tasteless!"}
{"text":"A great burger made fresh in front of your eyes not that frozen fast food stuff they actually cook a piece of meat on a grill ... You can choose your own toppings and there's free peanuts ... The price is a bit expensive but its worth the price just for the burgers"}
{"text":"The best veggie burger around! Thpugh no kids menu and hate having to bring my own snacks for my kid to eat... We are not here often as it is quite pricey and no \"meals\" per se..."}
{"text":"1 cheeseburger,  small fry,  large coke $16.00? Five Guys makes a good burger but it's still fast food and these are not fast food prices. I won't be coming back. At least not in Montreal."}
{"text":"Fresh food and by far one of the best burgers in the area. I was a little skeptic at first, but the make everything fresh and have a very simple menu that reminds me a lot of the In-N-Out burger in the western U.S.

Fries are cut fresh and the burgers are made to order. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The burgers is very good better than the fast food places (except for Wendy's), the fries is home cut with the skins on if you order reg size which I find is big enough for two overall it is pricey for a burger plus fries is separate, so about 15 dollars just wish they make a combo deal soon.
Final thoughts the burgers is very good"}
{"text":"ordered online (which was quick & efficient) i arrived about 10 minutes later and gave my name..they dont cook your fries until you get there but it was still pretty quick.. staff was nice and welcoming.. will be going back"}
{"text":"Meilleur burger que j ai mang√©! Les Burgers sont savoureux et copieux ! Les frites taille standard  sont assez grandes je recommande de prendre les petites frites ou de partager la taille normal. Service rapide"}
{"text":"I know it's \"just Five Guys\" but I LOVE this location! Really, the owner of this location should be very proud of his staff here. Every single member of the staff is not just nice but they always genuinely seem excited to be there talking to you.  The place is always super clean and with the view of the city while eating outside- you can not beat it! I say this after numerous visits (my office is right across the street at Picnic Table Productions so I am here at least 3x a month)"}
{"text":"Ok don't get me wrong the food here is great, a little expensive but for the most part filling and I used to come here alot. However my last visit was anything but enjoyable considering one of the employees forgot to put a patty in my burger!!! So I get home and the buns are there the toppings I even asked for bacon and that was there but NO PATTY, I don't know how they managed to skip my sandwich on the assembly line but yeah for the price you pay you should get what you pay for! I probably won't be going here anymore #Sorrynotsorry"}
{"text":"Burgers and fries are great and come with a lot of options.  Portion sizes are huge as well!!  What I'm most impressed about though is the customer service.  This is a simple burger and fries place and the staff always goes out of the way to make sure you're comfortable.  My wife has celiac disease so she can't eat any gluten.  The staff takes extra care to not cross contaminate anything.  We've gone to this location numerous times and it's always the same.  Well managed, great staff, and excellent food.  Can't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst five guys I've been to. The service was horrible. The lady at the cash register asked what flavor I wanted my milkshake. I said vanilla and I assumed she heard me because I said it very loudly, but of course she messed it up and made it chocolate. I told her I said vanilla and very rudely said that's not what you said. Her attitude towards me and my friend was rude the whole time. I asked for a cup of water and she just gave us empty cups to fill with water. She assumed we weren't gonna get water and was watching us the whole time and saying if we didn't get water we were gonna pay. She just wouldn't leave us alone. The burgers and fries are extremely overpriced and just taste horrible. Honestly and truly dissatisfied and never coming back don't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Really good food but too greasy for my liking! Expensive for the type of food they serve. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love five guys, but this particular place wasn't doing it for me. The main seating area smelled almost exactly like the humane society, and that was kind of off putting. Also they put the peanuts on top of the trash cans, which seemed like an iffy decision to me. It also felt pretty dark and dingy.

The food was standard five guys fare, though, which means it was delicious."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff but you can't have a conversation with anyone at your table because they play the music so loud you have to scream to be heard.  Turn the music down and I'll come back.  If not there are plenty of other restaurants in this busines center."}
{"text":"This place came very highly recommended, but ultimately I found it was merely \"very good.\" It's pretty distant from the Burger's Priest burger, and I'm not sure how anyone could prefer Five Guys based purely on the burger itself.

This isn't to say it's a bad burger: it's not. Well cooked on a griddle, fresh toppings and generally good flavour, but I found it under seasoned. The fries are tasty, and the extra heapload they add into the bag is a stroke of genius, for we all know that bag fries are best fries. Don't get a large fries; you won't need it.

Service is very friendly, and the space, while basic, offers lots of space to sit and eat. A solid choice when you're nearby, but it's not exactly a destination."}
{"text":"I suppose you can considder me a Five Guys Virgin *queue the dirty jokes*

She misheard my order due to the obnoxious music volume.  I ordered two hamburgers but she put it in as two little burgers--regardless--they were great burgers.
I also order regular fries and it was more than I had expected from a burgers and fries joint.
it seems as if they take a drinking cup and fill it with fries, but then just end up emptying an entire 3 cups more or something, it's funny to watch.  

Overall, the food was great, a little expensive (I paid 15.90 for 2 little burgers, reg fries.), and she misread my order.  I would rate it 3 1/2 rounding up to 4.

Try it out, but it's surely not your every day burger place, maybe a payday place to eat at."}
{"text":"This place has finally given up!  Last time I visited the floor was filthy; not just with peanut shells, but trash!  The ketchup dispensers were dirty and empty, all the tables were dirty. My kids ordered hot dogs and they told us five minutes after ordering that they don't have hotdogs. But they would replace it with a grill cheese... another place goes into to the \"We don't give a crap about our customers\" category. Farewell Five Guys if Goodyear!"}
{"text":"Check your receipt. This location likes to charge for eating in even after you've said \" to go\" twice."}
{"text":"My go to place to have a cheat meal after an intense week of working out. Love the burgers, hot dogs, fries and pretty much everything else they have to offer. If you're looking for a tasty burger then five guys is a good option!"}
{"text":"Same as any of the other parts of the chain. Prices are step but the burgers are top notch. Plus the Cajun fries are delicious."}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries.  You'll have to wait.  This place was exciting when it first open but now it's like - eh.  I'd rather have McDonalds.  Is that so wrong?"}
{"text":"Good burgers lots of toppings. Fresh fries and I like the Cajun seasoning. Neat pop machines too."}
{"text":"Fresh hamburger. Not frozen. Fries made fresh too.  Kind of like in-n-out. Nice place."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've ever had! I like being able to add grilled mushrooms at no extra price. Most places charges extra for that. Five Guys burgers never leave me feeling overly bloated or heavy. The meat has plenty of flavor and the fries come in HUGE portions. The peanuts are a great touch too! We will be back!"}

{"text":"I love Five Guys Burgers.  Keri helped me and was very friendly and patient, since it was taking me a little time to figure out what I wanted."}
{"text":"Tried this burger chain restaurant for the first time.  Heard a lot of great things about this chain.  But unfortunately I was not  \"wowed\" by it.  Had the hamburger, which contained double patties, with \"everything\".   Little hamburger would have a single patty.  The burger patty was bland & didn't have any taste to it.  If it wasn't for all the free tasty toppings, then the burger would have been little to talk about.  My friend ordered the bacon burger, but unfortunately the bacon was burnt, & so was very dry.  We also ordered a large cajun fries.  The portion which they gave us was double the amount of the container that it came in! (All the extra fries went into the bottom of the brown paper bag which the order came in.) So that was a wonderful surprise!  But quantity unfortunately does not mean quality.  The taste was only so-so.  Was expecting the cajun fries to have a nice kick to them, but that wasn't the case.   Pop had unlimited re-fills.  Staff were friendly.  As this restaurant just recently opened, it may take some time before it can live up to the brand's hype. When compared with Johnny Rockets (JR), I think JR produces a more flavourful and tasty burger."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this brand (not exactly this location) and finally asked my wife to pick a couple of burgers up. I hate to say, but it's one of my biggest fast food disappointments: totally dry and tasteless burgers. Maybe it's just my luck, but first experience has been really bad. Very friendly staff, as my wife said..."}
{"text":"Awecome burgers -- have been to several of them in the Calgary area, but I have been to this one the most since I live in Airdrie.  Best burger I have had in the city and I took my folks there when they were in town visiting and they said it was the best burger they have ever had!  The cajunn fries are fantastic and a must add on to your burger!  Good service and great value!"}
{"text":"I tried Five Guys for the first time on a trip out to visit friends in NV. We only recently got them near us in Los Angeles.

Enjoyed the burgers. They reminded me of homemade burgers done on the grill. But they didn't blow me away. 

I'm still a believer in the In-N-Out burger, and still stand by it when I say INO has some of the BEST burgers when it comes to fast few. But Five Guys is definitely up there!!

I'm not sure the burgers are worth the price however. Reminds me of Fatburger. A big price tag for fast food."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here. Great burger. Usually sit outside. Kinda noisy inside. But overall good."}
{"text":"Jan 16, 2016 @ 7 pm.
The patrons here on a weekend are usually the spill over from the waiting line next door popular ramen restaurant.

One word for the burgers.
.....
Mediocre
.....
Period

Trust me... Peanuts don't go with burgers .. even if they are free. They go with booze. Just ask the patrons at Jack Astors!

Thanks for reading my review :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this five guys two different times and both times I stood there for over three minutes before someone came to take my order. The second time I went they also denied that they were open until ten when the website said otherwise and even if they closed at nine it was still five minutes til. I have worked in retail and the restaurant business and the customer always comes first. Unfortunately for this five guys they don't understand that concept. I will be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The veggie burger is TO DIE FOR. Definitely add cheese, trust me it makes a difference. It is a little heavy so i would definitely say its more of a treat than anything, but you have to try it, vegetarian or not! Staff is always friendly and greet you right away. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was once asked during a job interview how I handle stress and my answer was \"potato chips.\"  Not the healthiest response, but it is illustrative of my love of potatoes.  Until today, I thought it extended to all forms, but I was mistaken.  I do not love the fries at Five Guys.  They were plain and mushy.  The best part was the ketchup.

I had the grilled cheese, so I can't comment on the burgers.  The grilled cheese was sad and I didn't finish it.  The soda machine stressed me out.  The whole experience made me miss Create (the place that used to be there) and question President Obama's judgment when it comes to fast food.

I gave it two stars because it was clean and the girl working the cash register was very nice.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"OMG... YuM yUm Yuuuuummm!!!! 

If you're looking for an amazing burger to satisify your every craving... then THIS IS IT!!

For what you get, the price is perfect.. Burger was juicy & fell apart as I ate it. But I think that's what a good burger is all about..lol. The grilled toppings they offered were all grilled to perfection as well!

Fries were good & a serving for 2-3.

My only complaint was the high tec Coke machine.. don't get me wrong it was pretty awesome but not logical for such a busy, small, fast paced place. It slowed things down tremendously..lol. But how could it not when their were over a 100 options to chose from..lol. They were touch screen operated even :)

The Coke machines slowed dwn evrything so much that they were calling my order number before I got my drinks!!  Oh well.. the experience was awesome.. ohhhh and the peanuts they give you when you walk in..  

I've lived here over a year and can't believe this is what I've been missing.."}
{"text":"Over priced and underwhelmed. The burger was ok the only memorable item was the bacon. The fries which I watched come out of the frier were forgettable. For a better meal at half the price I will stick to in n out."}
{"text":"Five guys was good. I think I liked their service the best. Every time I turned around someone was there to ask about the meal. I think they could have better timing, but what can you do. Every time someone came over we had food in our mouths. Hello trying to eat. The food was good. This was my first time going there and the Cajun fries were great. We got a medium cup. I seen the size of a small cup and you think ok not a bad size. I didn't realize they were using the size of the cup as the scooper not as a fry holder. The burger was okay nothing fabulous but a good burger. I think the service was good. the food was okay, but I really like that they had all of the peanuts in the line. I was a little thrown on what to think of that. I had an interesting experience and it was fun and enjoyable."}
{"text":"neat and friendly place! burgers are always juicy and fresh! regular fries are good although the Cajun fries are something else! if you feel like eating a burger go and check this place out!"}
{"text":"Went there today with my 12 y/o son because I've heard that this is the best place for a GREAT BURGER
.
Unfortunately the $30 we paid for 2 burgers, 1 fry and 2 cokes was a waste of at least $20 of those dollars.
Bland burgers, too well done with cheese that wasn't even melted!
If they charge so much you'd think they'd have flame grille, thick paddies etc.
The fries were good and the staff was friendly tho. That's why I give them 2 stars.
Definately NOT the best!"}
{"text":"My first visit to a five guys...the one at home is 45 mins away so i took advantage while i was here.  got one all the way, some fries and a drink for $11.  i little pricey but good and the fries are a double portion easy.  i agree w/ a lot of the other reviews that its fast food at restaurant prices.  the exception is the amount of toppings.  hard to find that anywhere else.  would i go back...yes but not on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Earnest help who want to please. I eat meat occasionally, but only hormone free. Would go to this convenient place if they had a healthy hamburger; either grass fed and/or hormone free."}
{"text":"I saw a story on the TV about this place and decided to give it a try. It was a good burger. It is bit pricey but oh well. It was juicy and had good flavor and the fries were tasty too. Not reinventing the wheel by any means but my burger tasted good and that's what it's all about."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today... not my first time... burger patties are pretty small but good.  Ordered the bacon burger and can't seem to find the bacon this time... lol

Fires are pretty good as well...

All in all, not bad... but a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"GROSSLY over-priced!

Don't waste your money.

Go one block east (Craig and 15 freeway) to the In-N-Out and get WAY BETTER for HALF the price.

I'd never go to Five Guys again . . . TOTAL RIP OFF."}
{"text":"Called at 9.40 and asked for an order to be picked up. Jamie was his name I believe. Asked if I made it there in five minutes to order in person could I possibly take food to go ??  I was basically told to go to hell. Drove by and the open sign was on. 9.55. I called and the manager said sorry and that's about it. Will never spend a penny there again."}
{"text":"Fun and loud diner style restaurant, with the traditional red/white checker design.

When you first enter the place, you'll see bags and bags of potato piled up.  A box of peanuts by the entrance to help yourself while you wait for your order.  The service is impeccable, from ordering to eating (the servers come around asking how everything is)

The food is excellant.  The burgers are juicy and the bun is just right (nothing too crusty or mushy).  You have many toppings to choose from, but make note, the regular hamburger has 2 patties while the \"little\" burgers have 1 pattie.  I always order just the regular fries because you'll always get A LOT extra in your bag.  Did i mention the fries are divine? They are local potatoes from the East Coast that makes it THAT much better.  Sorry New York Fries, you're on the sideline now.

1 Bacon Cheeseburger, 1 Little Cheeseburger, 1 Regular Fries, 1 Regular drink (free refills) = more or less $20."}
{"text":"Five Guys, like Smashburger, is based around a marketing plan that involves intentionally high prices and telling the customer they are receiving a higher quality product.

On one hand, the fries are great, even if they are your sodium intake for the month. The burgers, on the other hand, are so-so. Not bad, mind you, and they are definitely fresh and custom made. They're just not that great. They remind me of something I would pull off of the grill in the backyard. 

For the money, I'll just go to In-And-Out, save a few bucks, and get a better burger. Still, if you've never been, you should check them out at least once if for no other reason than the fries and awesome soda machine."}
{"text":"yeah its good, yeah they give you entirely too many amazing fries, yeah its not healthy at all so what. 
 i would give them 5 stars thats how much i like it but there is one problem, that stupid coke machine. these damn things are popping up everywhere and guess what they suck. Go get coke out of one i dare you. then tell try to tell me it that it tastes right cause it doesn't. it tastes wrong like it has a splash of lime or something in it. oh and don't plan on not getting soda dripped on your wrist while you are putting ice in the cup. yup reach your cup to the back to put ice in and drip drip drip over your hand from the spigot. wtf"}
{"text":"I really used to like this place but they've cut back on the serving size of the fries. A bacon double cheeseburger is ~$10, so to have them getting thrifty with their previously generous fries has put me off. Decent burgers but the value just isn't there any more."}
{"text":"Best five guys in town when it comes to service!!! Diego really took care of us! Last time we went in for to go I ordered lil cheeseburger w extra mushrooms but when I got home only to realized there are no mushrooms on my burger. Then I called in spoke to Diego and he said he will put my name on the book and next time I come in he will take care of it. 

Called in today about 2weeks after, one lady insisted that she did not see my name there at all. Diego took the phone and told me just come in and he will take care of my order. So I ordered 3 burgers and 1 lil Cajun fries, for pick up. When I came in I was expecting to pay for my other 2burgers and my fries but again Diego took care of my whole order! For that reason, because of him I will keep coming to this Five Guys. Thank you Diego!!"}
{"text":"I like Five Guys. This location was hit or miss. I've had good to great service and food here...and then there was the time a line worker handled a CUSTOMER'S IPHONE with her gloved hand and then went BACK TO THE LINE and proceeded to assemble burgers without changing gloves. GRA-oss! Git yer money back and run, which is what I did that time.

Sssooo, could go either way with this location, depending on the staff. But when the staff was on point, the burgers and fries were exceptional. Go to Delux and they'll BURN your well-done burger. At Five Guys, they perfectly cook a well-done burger.

Fries were fresh cut and the store was always clean.

THIS LOCATION HAS CLOSED. No media stories or anything...there's just a Tokyo Joe's where Five Guys used to be, as we saw today. wtf? Anyone...anyone? I thought a rapidly-expanding fast-casual chain would be opening, not closing stores...??"}
{"text":"So good. So juicy. Not for the calorie counters that's for sure! Huge cheeseburger  bag O fries. What more can I say?? Nothing fancy about this place but based on the line up no one was complaining. My son loved the fries. Gluttony at its finest!!!"}
{"text":"Five guys beats in'n'out everytime. Double cheese with everything makes me very happy. Fries second only to McD."}
{"text":"Best burger around. The bacon is super crispy and they don't skimp. Would be a five star if it was faster during lunch but they're always busy"}
{"text":"All the guys working tonight were awesome. Best staff I've seen in a long time! Definitely coming back because of service."}
{"text":"Guy at register didn't know how to describe what a bacon cheese dog had on it...regardless of that the food was GREAT!!"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Five Guys a few years ago when I lived in Phoenix.  Specifically at the Scottsdale mall.  Imagine my surprise when I moved back to Vegas exactly one year later to learn there was one here. I thought Five Guys was specific to Arizona, specifically THAT location.  And then I traveled to England and Five Guys is everywhere there?!  Clearly this is a chain, and an international one at that. 

All that said...the important bits are these:  they make a good burger buts just okay. Its not special.  Its not great. Its definitely overpriced. $5.99 for a LITTLE BACON CHEESEBURGER better WOW! me with flavor alone. It doesn't.  

The LITTLE sized burgers aren't code for kids meal...its a normal sized, one patty deal.  I like you can customize your toppings & sauces.  For someone like me who hates mayo or \"special sauce\" that comes standard at other places, that I can order mustard & know I'll get the mustard (or ketchup, or A-1) I asked for, is different & nice.  

The bacon is crispy, again a nice change from the raw fatty pieces you often get elsewhere. 

Not keen on the multi-flavored drinks machine. Having used one in the past, while a neat George Jetson contraption, it totally messes up your drink. One spigot dispensing 100s of flavored soda combinations daily leaves behind a funky taste in your REGULAR Coke fill.  It's gross.  I bring my own drink or order take away instead. 

What makes this place better than other burger joints are the fries. I like they aren't frozen and instead are made from fresh spuds. I even like that an order of LITTLE FRIES feed more than 1 person. I'm not keen on the amount of grease the brown paper bag absorbs...these are greasy...but the fries are fresh & not salty & I for one love that. Others might not...

Unfortunately when I arrived last night, my first visit here, I found the inside to be a mess. Lots of empty tables that were dirty.  The floor was dirty.  I opted to take my meal home to eat.

I didn't get peanuts, nor was I offered any.  Not a big deal, but everyone raves about the peanuts...I can't say anything more about it than this.

To me, Five Guys is average. It will never be my first choice but when I'm not in the mood to hit Gordon Ramsay's BurGR or fight the In & Out crowds I might...MIGHT...come here if I'm craving a burger & am too lazy to cook one at home."}
{"text":"This place is over priced and undervalued, the meat they use on the burgers has no taste and the fries are soggy. It is way overpriced for anything you get their. Save your mony any go somewhere else. Although I am no fan of In n Out burger it is way less expensive and the frys are much better."}
{"text":"With Lenny's and Lucky's being so close, the burgers here are a late night compromise, only. I'd rather have a side of peanuts over the soggy fries; that is, if they'd let you. And really, their burgers are really just an expensive version of something you'd expect to get from a campground grill or the high school cafeteria."}
{"text":"I go to Five Guys all the time. I like the regular fries and my girl likes the cajun. We asked the cashier and they were very nice and let us know you can order some cajun seasoning on the side and apply it to your liking. Hope this works for you!

Five Guys is the best! I used to think In-N-Out Burger was the bees knees but my opinion changed as soon as I was introduced to Five Guys. Anyone who is unsure about a new chain in this area should really take a friend (or two) and try it. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Warning if you have a peanut allergy steer clear of this place! Large open boxes of peanuts line the one wall. 

This has to be my favourite burger place to eat.  

Yes you have to wait a few minutes for your burger but that is because they are making it fresh not like your local McDonald's or Burger King where your patty has been sitting in a drawer under a heat lamp all day.  And in the mean time you can snack on all the peanuts your heart desires.

The toppings are always fresh and the fries are steaming hot. (Which are also handmade in the store once you order.)

Your burger comes in a brown bag whether you are eating in or taking out. If you order fries they always throw more in bag no matter what size you order. Even the small size is prefect for sharing! 

Whenever I get a craving for a burger this is my go to place can't wait to go back I'm hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Great burgers!! Had the chance of trying this chain in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Extremely popular in the States, try your cheeseburger with fresh jalape√±os... And those fries, amazing! Coming back for more soon."}
{"text":"wow. in n out... take a back SEAT baby!

These are some seriously good burgers man. there was a sign on the window that said \"the best 5 bucks you can spend on a burger.\" i would have to agree. for starters, the meat patties are literally twice as big as the ones in n out, and they give you two. you can pick from tons of toppings... pickles, grilled onions, mushrooms (the ultimate), lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, etc. i got the grilled onions, mushrooms, pickles, tomatoes, and lettuce, with some mustard. man that bad boy was FAT. it really was quite a good burger, i'd prefer it over any restaurant burger. the meat was defintely fresh and juicy, didn't taste frozen. the bun was nice and moist and chewy. the ingredients were fresh. wow. only 5 bucks. sure a whole in n out meal costs 5 bucks, but u wont get a burger like this on the west coast. i think theres one in cerritos though..

the fries... my friend loved. they taste like boardwalk fries. apparently theres cajun fries i ddn't get to try those, but these fries are better than in n out for most people. i think i got used to in n out fries so i like em anyway. but note to self, get cajun fries.

and oh. all you can eat peanuts if you want. what a nuttin good deal."}
{"text":"All dressed burger with no tomatoes and real meat. What more can you ask for! 

All dressed consists of mayo, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, ketchup and probably something I am forgetting.. I ordered fries but next time I will just order just a large burger (two patties) instead of a small burger (one patty)"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, the prices are a little steep is my only complaint really. I love being able to order online and then go pick it up."}
{"text":"I was craving fries and the food trucks were not at Ryerson, so I decided Five guys burger and fries would be a better option compared to Mcds or Pizza Pizza fries. They just opened this location today so I was expecting massive line ups and rushed orders. 

I ordered the large Cajun style fries. It came out quickly, which maybe a bad sign since they were busy yet the fries came out so quickly. It was a bad sign since the fries were soggy and not crispy like how they usually should be, and it was unevenly coated which i didn't mind as much as I did about the sogginess. 

I guess next time I'll just skip the fries craving and just order a burger which they take more care into creating."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place and it didn't disappoint. It was over $15 for a cheeseburger , fries and a coke. I didn't love that, but I did love my burger. Juicy and tasty. As good a burger as I have ever eaten. Very simple menu, which works for me, when i go to a burger joint ,I want a burger and fries.This will be where I go when I crave a burger. But try and go on off hours. I got there before noon and it was already getting busy, by the time I finished eating it was very busy."}
{"text":"You can't really go wrong at 5 Guys Burgers. I like that they have those digital touch screen soda machine that has ginger ale. I always get the jalape√±os on my burger and pretty much everything else too. 

Their French fries are remarkably good as well and they give you a ton of them."}
{"text":"I visited Five guys recently for the first time and I can see why they have opened so many locations in such a short period of time.  Their menu is pretty basic, hamburgers and dogs and lots of free toppings to choose from. I had a double bacon cheeseburger with bbq sauce and onions.  

The burger itself is nice and juicy and tasty, but I can't get past the cheese. It just tasted weird, like I dunno, it didn't belong with it. In N Out still has my vote on a better burger.  One thing 5 guys does do better though is their fries. They are oh so good and well seasoned. Definitely better then any other burger place in my opinion.  

Their drink machine is off the wall. I was taking my order to go so didn't get one but I couldn't resist checking out all the different options you can make up with anything from water to soda to powerade.  Also while you wait they have peanuts you can munch on. 

So for the burger with the weird cheese I give 3 stars because for the price I think a key ingredient like that should be of better quality."}
{"text":"I rarely eat \"fast food\" but man do I totally love the cheeseburgers at Five Guys. And the fries, they give you too many but I'm not complaining about that. Soooo good.  Free peanuts while you wait. Love that old concept. :)"}
{"text":"The hamburger didn't fit the bun. It was dry and overcooked. The children in the kitchen kept yelling out order numbers, very annoying when trying to eat. The fries were served with the scrapings from the fryer,  pay more attention to quality."}
{"text":"Burgers - Free Toppings - and a Mountain of Fries  . .  OH MY!

I like burgers as well as the next guy,  . . . QUESTION : so what could be different about one more burger place?  ANSWER: Everything on top . .  Grilled Mushrooms, grilled onions and green peppers . .  A1 steak sauce! . .  GEEZE! What could be better . .  The toppings are FREE!

EVEN MORE . .  be careful if you order the fries . .  Warning they give you more fries than you can eat, even if you don't have a burger . .  so bring the kids and get 1 order of fries for the family! They also have Cajon Fries that are spicey . .  I like spicey ! YUM!"}
{"text":"Big portions! To quote Samuel L Jackson \" that's a tasty burger\"   You too will think the same. I did not like the Cajun fries, but the people I gave them to, next to me, enjoyed them."}
{"text":"Don't bother with ordering food from this location. Online or in person they will mess it all up. VERY DISAPPOINTED. How can ordering on an application turn so wrong? Pick and choose from two burgers ordered to make up a Frankenstein burger and don't stop there! Make TWO of them! I live too far away to go back after a long day of work and fighting traffic for my dinner. I will NOT return to this location."}
{"text":"Slow service, unenthusiastic staff.  Waited 7 minutes just to watch them finally put my patty on the grill.  Store was not busy.  Staff not focused on the customer at all.  I've had much better experiences at the downtown location.  Tried to get a late lunch at 2:00 in the afternoon, and it took 20 mins to get my food.  Store was not busy at all.  I would stay away from this location until staff gets their act together.  As far as the whole 5 guys thing, I saw 2, maybe this is why things took way to long.  I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"ive had friends in florida RAVE about 5 guys. i never drove out to the locations when they opened in the east valley but when this one opened i figured sure ill try it.  first time i went..not so good so i held off making judgments because so many people raved about it.  so i tried again. i ordered online...said my order would be ready in 15min. i arrived to pick up my order just over 15 min later and proceded to watch people order at the counter and get their food before myself.  seemed strange, what was the point to order online?  after waiting at the pick up counter for 10min they said you have the online order right...yes... then they bag up my burgers and put them up on the couter where they sit for another 10min until the fries are done.  I LOVE GREASY BAD FOR YOU FOOD.  but i couldnt even eat the fries.  they were soaked in grease.  which one would say greasy fries = good but not these. i think they did not blanch the fries before deep frying them.

the burger i will not rate beacause by the time they sat for over 20 min then the 5 min ride home they bread turned into a mush around the meat.  i did eat a burger in the place the first time and...needless to say there are several better options in the valley. even in-n-out burger is much much better."}

We Went in to eat for the first time and while reviewing the menu I asked \"are the hotdogs all beef ?!?\" the employee's reply in a very condescending manner was \"that's what Kosher means !!!\"  Rather than getting into an argument with this young man about the actual definition of \"kosher\" I decided to take my money elsewhere !!!  Customer Service is an important element of any dining situation and this place has NONE !!!"}
{"text":"Arrived at this Five Guys burgers earlier today for lunch for the first time at any of there chained restaurants. My visit was ok, then again, I don't expect much from these greasy spoons anyways. 

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with a large set of regular fries for myself & 2 others. The burger was good, but lacked a bit of flavour in the beef patties. The bacon helped a bit flavour wise. The fries were a little over cooked when I got them. 

The only issues I've came across there was, the music was too loud & the table I sat at was too wobbly. & just a tip to anyone reading this, the food is over priced, expect to shell out more if you decide to buy anything."}
{"text":"We paid $17 for a single cheeseburger and a double cheeseburger with any toppings of our choice plus two drinks. We shared a regular fry. The burger was good and the people were nice."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the best French fries in town I wouldn't be back...fantastic French fries and fantastic texture and taste. Unfortunately the overpriced burgers are a hard beef to swallow... nothing special here. Average looking restaurant as well. In n out burgers taste much better and have a better price for sure."}
{"text":"This Restaurant is fantastic!  I didn't have time to order anything because while I was there, I got a phone call from a friend who moved away last year.  I hadn't heard from her in months, but talking to her again just brought back so many good memories!

5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great burgers made to order, you chose from many toppings with no extra charge!!  They give more than enough fries and guaranteed you will be full by the time you finish your meal! It would be nice to have a selection of dipping sauce than ketchup with all the fries they give you,Unless there's a secret sauce we're not aware of. Very clean place and always friendly when we go there!!! They give you a nice \"welcome\" when you walk in. I would put these burgers against any top restaurants! Also the free all you can eat peanuts while you wait for your food is a bonus!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers and fries here. Fry portions are huge. I will be trying a stand alone Five Guys since my daughter (who eats the burgers quite often) says the food is much better than the mall location. Service could be a little better, was hard to get condiments for some reason."}
{"text":"Ok folks!! Came to this place while NOT so hungry but since i pass by i decided to try it out since their reviews have been pretty good. I ordered the cheese burger with all the toppings and green pepper, also a little fry. The burger was wrapped in tin foil (very good), when i open up i realize how thick and big the burger was!! No wonder they charge more than other burger stores. First bite i couldnt even eat the top bun because it was so thick, it has two patties and two cheese and the toppings, each patty is VERY thick and juicy, but i think is the cheese that makes the burger stands out, there was so much cheese that i felt like eating a pizza. Its like pizza good. Then the fries i ordered a little fry their smallest size then i saw not only the cup was filled with fries but the whole bag!! They fried your fries after u order so it was crisp and the thickness is similar to Wendy's which i think is the best size. At the end i couldnt finish the fries, even if i were very hungry i might not want to eat all that, because they r not healthy, but once a while is OK! I give this burger 4.9 stars, is a burger that would give u the whoa feeling when u eat it. Very juicy! If i have to pick a bad point which i dont think is all that bad is the cheese although it was thick and tasted excellent, it feels too unhealthy, i almost feel like im an american. I wish they would change to swiss cheese or other healthier options. Overall this meal makes you feel satisfied but will leave u with guilt because they give u too much fries and its hard to not eat when u see them!!"}
{"text":"I just love this location!!  I have been to another and this place is the best.  The manager is an awesome person that people have always been friendly to me and my family.  So let's get to the food!!

Best burgers we have ever had and you can customize them.  You can literally put any all the toppings they have on your burger.  The fries are amazing and they have seasoning if that's your thing.  The TOTAL best part is how generous they are!!  we have always been given extra fries because of the kids.  They have even given me a free drink cup so I wouldn't have to go with out.

Just so happens I stumbled on a late night, just before they close secret.  (teehee)  Do you want to know? Well then order close to closing time and find out!!  Very fast, clean and attentive.  They talk to each other, sing tot the music, and talk to the customers.  Makes you feel like your part of the family.  We will go here again and again.   Bacon Double Cheeseburger will melt your heart.  LOL

Thank you to the owners, management, and especially the workers.  You guys ROCK!!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable place to eat! I was really impressed. This location makes great food and best of all is the customer service. The workers are in a good mood, seem to have fun and will put a smile on your face. I highly recommend this Five Guys."}
{"text":"Good burger and Fries spot!!

Excellent choice of toppings.

Only fries, no poutine, etc.

Had a burger and hotdog, both delicious.

Would recommend and visit again."}
{"text":"Even though we purchased food the staff wouldn't give us the code for the restroom. Made us dig through our trash to find the receipt. Great service there..."}
{"text":"The Five Guys on 1st... 5 stars plus!! The staff was phenomenal... Beyond friendly... I watched an employee pull money from her own pocket to feed a homeless man whom she addressed by name..he went on to tell us that the staff there has been a saving grace and they feed him has often as they can and when other people treat him as less than human they treat him as family.  All this in front of my kids who needed a lesson in humanity for sure.  Ive never been more proud of strangers.  They also sang behind the counter while working and they weren't bad!!! Class act!!!   I hope someone in a position of power sees this and takes notice...they make this company look good."}
{"text":"The best Hamburgers I have ever ate I used to love Burger King the most not anymore as 5 Guys ruined them for me.   I recommend eating here as the staff is great and the food is excellent plus they don't skimp out on the fries even the Little fry is big compared to other burger joints."}
{"text":"First time trying Five Guys was here and I was impressed. As someone probably already mentioned, a regular burger actually contains 2x patties, which feels like the size of a double whopper. Couple that with cheese, bacon, and \"everything on it\" and you have a formidable meal to contend with.

The fries are definitely something worth mentioning. For an in-n-out regular, i've become accustomed to stuffing my face with soggy, limp potato ropes. This place has the real deal. An order of regular fries is just a small drinking cup filled with thick, crispy, greasy fries. They load your cup of fries into your take out bag, then top off your bag with even more fries! They must have thought i was pretty hungry, ordering the bacon cheeseburger after all.

Be careful sitting near the back of the restaurant, AT&T reception is pretty bad inside."}
{"text":"After a pleasant experience at Five Guys in North Scottsdale, I decided to swing by the Tempe location after work for some quick, greasy food. 

Parking: Might be ok if you live right there and can walk over, but it was a bit of a hassle to take a couple spins around the area to find a parking spot.

Ordering: How does small bacon cheeseburger w/ everything on it turn into a plain cheeseburger with drink? Yeah, people make mistakes, but I like to think I'm eating a little healthy w/ some veggies tucked in between the buns. 

Fries: If there's any reason to go to Five Guys, it's for the fries. Now I don't know if this is standard practice, but the fry guy at North Scottsdale loaded up a small cup with fries, then placed the cup into a paper sack, then filled the paper sack with fries (which can only be described as awesome). However, this practice doesn't seem to carry over to Tempe. 

Quite disappointing, I'll be going to In-N-Out next time."}
{"text":"Very high price for a good burger with crapy fries (maybe that's why they give a huge amount of them)& no other options except for the fries."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger you can get for under $20
The place smells Holy Amazing when you come through the door!
The burgers are incredible but you dont feel like you just ate a brick for lunch when your done.
They basically give you 5 orders of fries when you ask for them and I recommend the seasoned ones."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Five Guys and we didn't know there was one just a 10 min drive from us I got super excited when we drove by it!

Wish I'd ordered the regular cheeseburger (2 patties) instead of the little cheeseburger (1 patty) but anyhow it was still very satisfying. 
My 3yr old daughter had the hot dog and it was also good, hubby kept taking bites from it ^.^ 

We'll definitely go back! and a bonus that its close to home!"}
{"text":"With so much talk about this place I had to try it and found it to be good but not spectacular. The burger meat could use some seasoning and the sides should be larger.."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries are decent here, but last time I stopped in to this location, the service seemed a bit lacking.  It was afternoon on a bad weather weekday and not very busy.  There was one order ahead of me so I patiently waited for them to fill it and it seemed to take a long time.  Then they started on my order (two burgers and fries).  They got one burger made up and on the counter, then when the guy went to put the second burger on its bun he dropped the burger.  The counter was positioned in such a way that the server had to pick up the bun on a spatula and then turn around with it and carry it a couple steps to the bun, so I can see how this accident would happen, but don't know why a franchise would set up their food prep area so the burger chef has to carry the burgers around in such an awkward way to get them on the buns. 

Obviously since the meat had hit the floor (and I was standing there watching it) they had to re-make that burger, during which time my other burger that was already made was sitting there on the counter made up and getting rather cold.  

I would say it took between 10 and 15 minutes for them to prepare my two burgers and fries, counting from the time they started making my order to the time they finished.  Not exactly a quick process and I was wondering how long it would take if they'd actually been busy, or maybe on busy days they send in a more efficient work crew?

As others have noted this restaurant isn't very appealing to eat in, or even to stand and wait for an order in.  Despite this location being significantly bigger than many other Five Guys outlets, the decor is totally lacking and the tables are cheap and rickety - overall it feels like a 70s food court."}
{"text":"I can't really say anything good about this place. The prices are very high for fast food, the quality is poor and I don't understand the messy peanuts. Maybe to fully alert customers to their use of peanut oil and how dangerous it is for allergy sufferers? The restaurant was empty but messy. I find this a bad sign.  There was a spoiled produce smell in the dining room too.   I don't see myself going back. Even if it was clean and smelled good, the burger is mediocre and not really worth more than $4 and $3 for a soda is high too. It's concession prices in a dirty strip mall."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers u can choose your toppings . Patty is soft and tender. Grilled mushroom and bacon with BBQ sauce is my favorite. The fries aren't the best but they always give u triple the portion. Service is quick and friendly . Opened till 10 in dix30. U can dine in restaurant , even has a terase for the summer. Also they have a peanut buffet to snack on before your burger arrives. It's the little things that counts. I love their concept. They have a wall to post your drawings which is fun."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful visit this morning. Employees are super friendly and greet you as you walk in the door. Got the bacon burger and it was fantastic. Additionally, they loaded me up with fries like no tomorrow! They don't just fill up the cup with fries to the top, THEY FILL THE WHOLE BAG UP TOO. Like, there's no room left for anything else in the bag! So awesome. The seasoning on fries was great. Actually tasted good instead of a dull potato you'd find at a fast food restaurant... 

Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"The food is, always good, but my problem is that the staff have a radio playing rap while the overhead music is playing Adele.... it is so loud in here .. it's very rude .... if the owners don't won't your rap playing then deal with the crappy Adele playing ..... the customers are the ones having to deal with noise pollution ...."}
{"text":"FOOD
- Little Hamburger: The little burgers have 1 patty, whereas the regular burgers have 2. The bun was super soft and nicely toasted, I topped mine with ketchup, lettuce, and grilled mushrooms. The patty was a little dry, but tasty nonetheless and had a great freshly made texture.

- Hot Dog: The bun was soft and the hotdog looked like it was flattened and split into two, so instead of the traditional cylindrical shape, it was like a sandwich. Tasty, but nothing special.

- Little Fries (Cajun Style): No extra charge for cajun fries, which I liked and the seasoning adds a little kick. The fries are fresh cut and tasted like, well, a real potato. Crispiness is hit or miss, some of the fries were limp and some crispy. The little fries come in a child-sized cup but are stuffed to the brim so I would suggest getting this as a nicely-sized side order.

Price: about $22 incl. bottle of water and regular-sized pop. Overpriced.

SERVICE
- Girl on the cash register was friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and had a great smile.

- There were 3 guys in the kitchen and it was hectic, but they finished orders quickly

- After you order, you take a seat anywhere you want and then you pick up at the back counter when they yell out your order #


ATMOSPHERE/LOCATION/MISC
- Located in the new Whole Foods plaza across from Canada Computers and beside Sheridan Nurseries.

- The actual storefront is beside Yogurty's (go for dessert!)

- Windows all around make it bright and the establishment is kept really clean (however, it's also relatively new)

- There's a large box of peanuts at the back counter, self-serve with a scoop."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant. The staff was very friendly, and they were very fast and efficient.  The food was also delicious! I would definitely recommend this Five Guys!"}
{"text":"Good burgers with multiple options of what you might want on it with no extra charge.  Very generous portion of fries... even sharing them there were a few left over. Large selection of soft drinks to choose from.  Staff was very friendly and efficient in preparing the custom ordered burgers,  even during the lunch crowd rush.  Was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I don't discriminate against a good tasting burger. Five Guys does not disappoint. Their cajun fries are good (and please note their \"small\" size is not small at all). You select all your toppings when you order (tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, BBQ or A1 sauce, etc). If you haven't tried one of their burgers, don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"Someone took my order instead of hers on mistake and left. The staff was so courteous, they gave us large fries instead of little for the extra wait and completely refunded our $20. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Classic place. Free peanuts while you wait for your food. The burger was good, but the fries can be kind of old sometimes. Greasy food, but it hits the spot"}
{"text":"The burgers are good. Didn't upset my stomach like some other hamburger joints. The cheese dog was OK. Nothing specials. 

The french fries at this joint are supposed to be the best but I was left feeling UNDERWELMED! They were not cooked at all and it left me with a cold oil taste in my mouth. The cajun fries in my opinion suck! They're loaded with obay seasoning and I can feel my Blood pressure rising with each fry."}
{"text":"So after hearing the hype of this place has a great alternative to In-n-Out I finally caved and decided to try it out. I really wanted to give this place 3.5 stars but yelp and their  no half star thing is stopping me. The burger was good and I enjoyed every bite. They have a lot of options for the burgers which is nice when you get sick of the more standard choices of In-n-Out.  But it comes at a price higher than I like to pay when I go to a fast food burger joint. I got a bacon burger with no special ingredients with fries and a regular coke. The total was over 12 dollars   The regular fries are good, the Cajun fries were overly salty for my taste but I can see the appeal for some people. I really did like the burger but next time I go I will forgo the fries and get the Jr. version of the burger to save the money."}
{"text":"Delicious burger and fries..love the vinegar on fries..Cook my burger med rare and you get 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite. Staff was friendly and I ordered a burger with two patties and a drink. I ended up waiting nearly a half hour to get my food. I understand freshness, but it looked as though they were cooking one order at a time. Five Guys is great, but this location could step it up."}
{"text":"While they have some awesome Cajun fries, the website does not tell you if you order online, they don't make it until you arrive which defeats the purpose of ordering ahead. 

The staff is nice and explained that I should call after placing my order but wish the website would have mentioned this so I didn't have to wait."}
{"text":"Took my Dad, brother, and nephew here since they are from out of town and never heard of this place. The restaurant was clean and even though there was a line, it moved quickly. Staff was on their game (I'm a chef so I look for that sort of thing). We got double bacon cheesebugers and both types of fries. The burgers were juicy and had lots of flavor, but for some reason I'm still partial to Carl's Jr.or, better yet, a burger from Delux. The fries are very good. Hand cut and skin on, these babies are quickly blanched in oil, cooled, and then fried to order, I had the Cajun and while nice and crispy, I could have used a. Bit more heat and cajun flavor. All in all, I give this place a thumbs up and will be back."}
{"text":"I tried this place yesterday with the family. The Cajun fries were so tasty! The burger was pretty good, but I hate when the bread gets kind of soggy. The kids seemed to enjoy the place and loved eating (more playing than eating) the free peanuts while we waited for the food."}
{"text":"First time to review, however, this was my 6th visit. The burger is perfect, the fries superb, I am a french fry nut, When I  say the fries are superb, you can trust me.
I ask for extra help, food brought to me, etc. I get 110% of what I ask for, from this terrific staff."}
{"text":"I was THRILLED to find Five Guys. I have tasted them across the eastern US and have yet to be disappointed. They are a teeny bit pricey (I'm cheap and I know it though), but their burgers actually taste like...burgers (unlike many fast food places). The fries aren't my favorite, but this location has the cool pop machine where I can have cherry ginger ale. As was previously stated, there isn't a ton of diversity on the menu. They're a burger joint and they stick to what they know. But if you want a good, fast burger (and a fun pop), this is a great choice."}
{"text":"I really like the hamburgers here just the way like it, but they need to improve some things. for example they can give you a tray and somenthing where to put your fries I don't like eating my fries from the paper bag you guys need to copy a little from In n out."}
{"text":"Stop by here all the time for the burgers and the fries! My son has food allergies but they cook there fries differently and he can eat them here! Awesome food! Recommend trying!"}
{"text":"Make no mistake this is not a fast food joint but a quick food joint. The burgers are great (it's the high quality ingredients and the bun) french fries are good (would of been better but were over cooked) and a large fry can be split three or four ways. Much better than IN-N-OUT (I know sacrilege, but true). I wish they would lose the \"commercially bagged \" tea and realize in the west only fresh brewed measures up."}
{"text":"Never been to the location, everyone from the East Coast told me this was the burger place to go. The parking is not bad, especially since I went during the lunch rush. I walked in and was immediately overwhelmed, there was peanuts and peanut bags everywhere. I walked to the cash register, and the cashier greeted me and could tell it was my first time. She was super sweet, she explained the way the restaurant worked, it was pretty simple menu wise which is always a plus. They list the toppings, you could choose them and not only that but they had a bunless option! That was the best part, I chose a bacon cheeseburger lettuce wrap. She gave me my number and told me it would be a few minutes. I watched the cooks work the food, they are super clean, organized and communicated with each other. The cashier did not just stand there and look pretty, she washed her hands and got to work; she kept shifting back and forth to the cash register. I appreciated that they washed their hands EVERY TIME they went to a new station. The cook had great customer service when she handed me my food. I left and enjoyed the burger, has to be the most juciest burger I have ever tried. The normal burgers have two patties on it, so it is well worth the price; I did not even need fries. I will definitely be back, without a doubt!"}
{"text":"I go for the fries!
Burgers are okay but fries are awesome, especially when they load it on and fill the bag. Normally places fill the fries cup, but this place often fills the fries cup and then loads up the bag with more fries!
Nice and clean atmosphere and the staff are always happy and great."}
{"text":"I ate the little burger. Love it and with all the free toppings especially grilled mushrooms and grilled onions. The fries are nice and crisp too. Next time I will order the bacon burger ! Big size!"}
{"text":"Best old school burgers in Mesa! The prices are a little high, but when you compare them to the insane amount of choices of toppings for your burger and the crazy amount of fries, the price is worth every cent. The people there are cool too. Never left Five Guys with a bad look on my face"}
{"text":"The food was great!  The advertisements saying its cheap... Kinda misleading 2 burgers, 1 large fry, 2 regular drinks was $21.00.

(I will say that the portions are excellent.)
So that does help justify the price."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food at this location.
Yes, it is loud and a little pricey but you get VERY large portions.
The food served to me has always been served hot.
Free peanuts! 
After years of cheap burger joints in the area it's nice to have an alternative.
I'll pay a little more once in awhile to get a REAL burger."}
{"text":"I have been here about 20 times and never had a bad burger. The buns are always fresh. The meat cooked perfectly and it has a real backyard BBQ style to its presentation. Simple but very effective. The fries are a very large portion so a small fry  will probably feed two just FYI. 
Definitely a good choice in the mall for quick lunch."}
{"text":"Bester Burger in den USA. Unschlagbar lecker. Man kann alles selbst zusammenstellen. Der Service ist super und w√§hrend man wartet kann man sovielmal Erdn√ºsse essen wie man will. Alles √ºberschaubar bis in die K√ºche und alles frisch. Achtung spicy ist f√ºr deutsche Verh√§ltnisse sehr scharf."}
{"text":"Ok,  so now that I actually have the time to write my review here I go...I was sadly disappointed after my visit to FIVE GUYS.  The food was not exactly as good as I expected.  The \"order your way, the way you want it\" didn't not exactly go according to plan.  We visited on a Saturday, midday.  It wasn't exactly very busy.  When we got our order it was completely a different order!  We both ordered a single specialty cheese burgers, we ended up with a plain cheese burger and a double with all the requested add ons. Then then lady  asked me if she gave me the dressings/ add ons,  If I just wanted to add them on myself! Really? Uh no!  So while my kid ate her burger, I waited for mine to be remade. Bummer.  The seasoned fries where really good.  I just which they had a better outdoor seating arrangement.  In the end I was left with a burger that feel apart, messy hands, and disappointed I didn't to to IN \"n\" OUT. I'm not sure they deserve a 2 star, wish there were half stars."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Steelyard Commons; staff is always friendly, attentive, and willing to help.  After a day of Holiday shopping in Steelyard (Target, Marshalls, Bath & Body Works, Petco, and Home Depot) I was ready for a quick bite to eat.  Went to another burger joint across the street and was ignored, and left after about 10 minutes, still hungry.  I drove across the street to Five Guys and was greeted with a smile and a short wait time.  I enjoyed the little bacon cheeseburger, cajun fries and the variety of Coca-Cola that they offer in their hi-tech dispenser.  I was back on the road in no time, no longer hungry or irritable.  

Great job Five Guys!"}
{"text":"I've had the hot dog and grilled cheese from here. Why? Because cheap, that's why.

The grilled cheese was really really buttery (yum), but not memorable. They're pretty generous with the cheese, but it might be worth knowing that the bread used is a burger bun - typical for fast food places. 

The hot dog though, was amazing. AMAZING. I think they toast the bun as well? I didn't get it loaded (ketchup, mustard, mayo), but holy Batman do I crave that thing. 

But they don't sell milkshakes. Isn't that a shame?"}
{"text":"Good hamburgers just a little bit expensive, but really good I will comeback. I recomend this place"}
{"text":"I have been to this location of Five Guys many, many times. I always come back because the food is so tasty and it's the closest location to my home. However, after having at least 5 bad experiences here, I will not be returning. Every single time I've come here with my  boyfriend, they have messed up on at least one of our burgers. They'll completely mix up the toppings on our burgers and we end up having to take them back so they can remake them. Today we went here for lunch, I ordered a hamburger, my boyfriend ordered a little bacon cheeseburger. When we received our order, the burger with the toppings I ordered was a little cheeseburger. The burger with the toppings my boyfriend ordered was a bacon hamburger. We noticed right away that my burger had cheese as I strongly dislike cheeseburgers (and cheese in general because I'm slightly allergic to dairy.) so my boyfriend brought it to their attention and they started making me a new one. Normally I would've just taken the cheese off and ate the burger anyway, but the cheese was melted onto the patty AND it was a little burger, instead of the regular that I ordered, so there was only one patty instead of two. Then we noticed that my boyfriends burger was also wrong (no cheese and two pattys instead of one) so he brought that to their attention as well. The manager, we believe her name was Wendy, tired to argue that we were wrong and that the burger we thought was his was mine, but he calmly explained that this was not the case and showed the receipt to prove it. She rudely argued until she finally gave up and re-made both of our burgers. I would also like to point out that I have heard this same manager talking about the employees in a very rude manner on several occasions. I honestly don't know why she continues to be employed here because it seems that every time I come in and she is working, the whole team seems unmotivated because she is so mean to them, telling them how replaceable they are and that she doesn't need them. I think it is completely unprofessional that she said these things in earshot of a customer.  My recommendation: if you want a delicious burger with similar high-quality ingredients in this area with excellent customer service, don't waste your time here and go to In 'N Out down the street. Next time I'm craving a Five Guys burger specifically, I'll be going to the location on Eastern, even if it is further from home."}
{"text":"Its was just OK!
Liked the fresh jalapenos option, fries hardly had seasoning, was a bit pricey, but filling.  Free peanuts, but wasn't sure if it was ok to throw on the floor. They use the same color scheme as In N Out which I thought was humerous.  I'll still give it another try in a few months."}
{"text":"1 Star and Five Guys are not words that belong together, but this location managed to botch this experience with my daughter that bad. I got the little cheese burger, all the way -- usually solid gold, and something I've seen them perfect time and time again. 
While waiting, the numbers after us were called and called then came the apology for the delay and the anticipated prize -- like opening a Christmas present (went a little far there with my metaphor, but you get the anticipation).  
Now, I don't disassemble burgers to run a QA check on these guys, they're the masters of burger making on a flat top!  First bite -- damn, this is over cooked. I'm hungry, I'll deal with it. Two bites later and that's it, I have a ton of bun left and not enough burger to balance this out. What. The. Hell. 
Daughter decided to be bold and asked to show the staff the problem. She goes to the counter and waits and waits and is ignored and waits. Then, I'm assuming a manager (black shirt vs red) asked her what she'd like while she explained that it wasn't right. Her reply?  What do you want me to do about it?  Well, that's when I stepped in and explained that this isn't normal to which I got a reply of: \"all of our burgers are 3 oz\". I've eaten Five Guys before, thanks, but that was jacked up. I guess she sensed our displeasure after a few minutes and offered to remake it. Eh, I've seen the movie \"waiting\" (great by the way), and I'm not letting this angry lady show me how special she can make this. To that I decided to leave and told her as much -- haha, no concern there. I've been spoiled by Chick-fil-A caring about their customers. 
And that's it folks, that's all it took to lose me from ever going back to this location. You can be a jerk to me, but to an 11 year old?  Come on!"}
{"text":"Felt like grabbing a burger while doing some last minute shopping, stopped at Five Guys.  Wanted to spend about $10.  When I took a look at the menu, I knew that the $10 budget was out the window.

Ordered a hamburger, small fries, regular drink.  Total, with tax $12.52!  

Burger was just OK, fries were good, and lots of them.  Nothing was worth the inflated price I paid.

On the positive side, the staff is very friendly, the place is clean, and they still have free peanuts."}
{"text":"I'm no burger connoisseur, but this was one of the tastiest burgers I've ever tried. This place is pretty no-frills, so forget about fancy goat cheese and avocado toppings, and instead embrace the tried-but-true lettuce, tomato and pickle combinations. (If you want something more creative, you can opt for grilled peppers and onions, too.) I went with the Little Cheeseburger (one burger patty instead of two), and found it to be just the right size. The burger was juicy and not overcooked at all. 

Burgers aside, the real showstopper at Five Guys is the fries. The portions are giant (trust me when I say you should split one order with a friend), and the fries are perfectly cooked so they are crispy on the outside but still a little \"mushy\" on the inside. I'm still dreaming about them. 

If I had to make a wish list, I'd say Five Guys needs to put a milkshake on the menu. While I certainly enjoyed my $3 Nestea (note the sarcasm), I found myself craving a chocolate shake which, in my opinion, is pretty much a staple when you're ordering a burger and fries. Even a root beer float would suffice!"}
{"text":"Put in an order online for pick up. Got the food brought it home and no bacon on either burger. I paid for an extra patty which was not included and toppings were messed up. They don't care here and neither should you.

Save some time go to inn n out mile north of this location"}
{"text":"I love me some cow on bread.  

Five Guys avoids one of the more deadly traps that befalls most burger-oriented venues: it doesn't take the hamburger too seriously.  
When I eat a burger, I don't want Kobe beef and aged cheddar cheese.  I don't want a southwestern aioli sauce and a pretzel bread bun.  I want  damn hamburger.  

Five Guys burgers are straight up burgers.  
Want cheese?  You got it.  
Mayo?  Cool.  
Jalapenos?  Crisp and fiery, (unlike the brine-soaked, nancy-pants sissy slices they call jalapenos at most other places.)  
What grade beef is it?  Tasty.
What sort of bread is it?  It's a hamburger bun.

And damn it, it's greasy deliciousness.

Add to all that, the fries are perfect.  Not to big; not to thin.  Greasy but crisp.  Fresh cut and fried.  Salty to no end.  

Five Guys isn't fast food and it's not The Counter.  But it's a perfect blend of the two.  It's simply the most satisfying burger and fries I've had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  There's the whole Five Guys v. In-N-Out argument, and which one is better, etc.  But the truth is, that's like comparing apples to oranges (whether you like apples over oranges, or vice versa, is a different story).  

To me, it tastes a little more like burgers you get fresh off the grill in your backyard (of course, that could be because they wrap the burgers in foil).  It is more expensive than In-N-Out, but when I order a small hamburger (one patty), fries and drink, it comes out to about $10.  That's the same as a burger at Applebee's or Red Robin, and believe me, this burger is MUCH better.  I also like that they offer a ton of toppings for \"free,\" i.e., they don't charge extra.  This allows me to get a burger with grilled onions, mushrooms and bell peppers (ohhhhh yeah, what's your name, who's your daddy).

The regular size fries come in a pretty decent sized cup, which is sharable with *at least* one other person.  (Depending on how much of a fry monster you are.)  Personally, I like the regular seasoned fries, as opposed to the cajun seasoned fries.  

Also, as other peeps have mentioned, the soda machines are touch screen that give you lots of soda options.  For example, for Diet Coke - there's Diet Coke Lime, Diet Coke Cherry, Diet Coke Cherry Vanilla, Diet Coke Orange, etc.  And that's just for Diet Coke.  It's like that for each type of soda, e.g., Fanta, Coke Sprite, etc.  It's awesome! 

As a FYI, this particular location appears to have the A/C on overdrive ALL the time.  It makes it a little uncomfortable to eat there sometimes.  I've been to Five Guys at the Las Vegas outlets and on Flamingo at the 215, and neither seem to have the same issue.  

Overall, I can't compare Five Guys to In-N-Out because for me, they're just different.  In my world (and with the help of an elastic waistband), I can make room for both."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of burgers. Overall, this nails everything a quick burger should be. 

Affordable, greasy, filling and tasty.

If you're a health freak, I think you can add lettuce to your bacon cheeseburger. Also, try the cherry milkshake."}
{"text":"Newly opened in the new strip mall on Laird in Leaside, so the wife and I tried it yesterday (Saturday) at around 2 p.m.  Since it is brand spanking new it looked very nice, bright and fresh. It has the requisite free peanuts that you can load up on while waiting, peanut shells all over the floor and they state that everything is cooked in peanut oil so if you have a nut allergy this place is definitely not for you.

The service was slow as the place was packed and the lady taking the orders makes sure to confirm every part of it before you pay for it.  At least that part is good, but I did notice that on the wall they'd posted that all of the burgers are cooked WELL DONE.  Unfortunately that sucks since the best burgers are never more than MEDIUM if not MEDIUM RARE.

The wife got a burger and I got a bacon cheese burger.  Those are burgers with TWO patties so if you want something lighter you should get the LITTLE version of them which is identical, but just one patty.  We both agreed that the meat had no real preservatives which was nice, but it was also fairly tasteless.  All the flavour comes from the condiments and toppings.  Part of this is because they cook them all well done, but they also commit the other cardinal sin of burger cooking and that is to press it flat on the grill with that stupid pressing tool that looks like it should be ironing someone's clothes.  That forces all the juices out of the burger.  That makes them dry and tasteless.  Anthony Bourdain would not be amused.

The only drink is soda pop which includes unlimited refills so don't bother getting anything beyond the smallest size since you can fill up the cup as often as you want.  They really need to offer milk shakes.

Lastly, the fries.  They were actually pretty good and we only got one order between us because I'd heard how they fill up the container to overflowing so that the bottom 3 inches of your paper bag contain fries as well.  We were not disappointed.  They were hot, tasty, crispy and plentiful.  In fact the fries are the reason for my 2 stars.

As for cleanliness I have a pet peeve.   Since many places in Toronto now spray the tables with a light disinfectant before wiping the table I expect the same from all U.S. chains moving up here.  If it's good enough for a home grown chain like St. Louis Wings then it should be good enough for 5 Guys, but instead all they had was some bored teenager wiping each table with the same damp cloth.  Way to spread the germs around 5 Guys.

Next time I'll just get my fries to go and head over to Harvey's for a much better burger."}
{"text":"Its just not good. Plain and simple. If I was at a homeless shelter and this was the food of the day, yes, I would eat it. Other than that, save your $6 and go to....anywhere else! Why is there 20 people working and they can't get a simple burger right? Makes no sense. And I figured it out...the music is loud as hell so you can't hear people complaining!"}
{"text":"Love this place fresh burgers and fries. Cajun style fries are the best!!. They have great service. Don't have any complaints. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Is it just me and or just my location but they have the worst fries ever. This is the only burger joint that I have ever been to that I refuse their fries. Thank you NO! I'll take a bag of peanuts.

 I like the hamburgers, thumbs up. Especially,  all the options they offer for their burger. 

How about some onion rings or some chips? Anything but those fries."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.  These fellas put together a good burger, but it is too expensive for fast food."}
{"text":"Was there during a Bay Village fund raiser and even though I have never seen the place so packed with people, the service was great. Every employee including the manager were so polite and never seemed to show their stress level, they looked like they were having fun. My compliments to all !!
Nice job! And by the way the food was awesome."}
{"text":"Soooooo full, can't move, so many fries! So much burger! Ohhh theres peanuts! Don't mind if I do!

Good place to get filled up on burger and fries, what else can I say?"}
{"text":"Just waited 35 minutes for three burgers and fries. While we were waiting they were turning people away saying they ran out of meat. And after they \"recovered,\" a patron received a burger with just a bun and no meat. Very disappointed in how things were handled!"}
{"text":"good burger though pricey for take out.  fries taste good but are limp.  nice staff - casual to the extreme - probably a little too casual, yelling back and forth about their personal life.  but very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place! Super yummy burgers and fries,  ultra friendly staff, place is clean and the music is Rocking all the time! The trip to eat at this place is so worth every penny! Just to give an idea of how welcoming this place is, a couple showed up right at closing time and they still serviced them with a smile :-) Now that is what I call Customer Service! The place is also eco-friendly, the bathroom lights turn on only when there is someone inside. They got my full support! The list goes on and on... KEEP ROCKIN'!!!! KUDOS!"}
{"text":"Grabbed 2 burgers and one large fry for dinner Thursday after work.  Got the hubby a regular bacon cheeseburger and i got the little bacon cheeseburger.  Since their large fry is so huge, we just split one.  They have all those topping to chose from so I picked what we wanted and got my drink while it was being made.  The restaurant was very clean and quiet.  They have peanuts to eat while you wait as well.  Brought our meal home and it was delicious!  Love those burgers.  I have never had the 'little' burger before and I was surprised that it wasn't what I would have called little at all.  Will definitely go back!  Besides. they are one of the few places these days that serve coke products to boot!"}
{"text":"We came in for lunch. My wife had a little hamburger and an Oreo shake. I ordered a cheeseburger regular fries and a regular coke. The bill came to $24.17 with tax. Pulp Fiction lines about tasty burgers flashed through my brain.  The shake came up first about six minutes before the food. It was thick and delicious.  Burgers came up and we began to eat.  Our number was called again as I was getting ketchup. They had made a duplicate shake. I told them we already got ours. What happened to the extra shake is a mystery that remains unsolved.   The tomato in my wife's burger was really green. I asked for another tomato, the kid behind the counter handed me another green tomato. I dunno, I thought a $5 burger should have a $5 burger tomato, but that's just me. I would suggest the owner talk to their crew and tomato vendor. Probably won't be back any time soon, over-priced for what was served."}
{"text":"Delish burgers and best bacon, salty, thick, and smokey.  And no charge for all the extra toppings.  I like how they post where the potatoes come from, it's nice to know what and where I'm putting into my body.  The fries are a little under cooked for me, I like mine extra crispy so I put them in the oven at home.   Extra friendly staff, simple atmosphere and good free peanuts to nosh on before your meal."}
{"text":"THE BEST BURGER

Five guys has honestly the best burger I have ever had. I visit this location quite often and always leave feeling full and satisfied. The burgers are amazing and taste perfect. While it is a little pricy I can always recommend this restaurant.

PS: Order Bacon"}
{"text":"Very tasty burgers. I frequent the York Mills location so the only reason this one gets one star off was serivice was a bit slow considering the amount of people working there."}
{"text":"One of the better burger places around. The staff is friendly and if it's your first time there, they take the time to show you the ropes.  Not that you really need ropes shown to you since they're making burgers not launching satellites into orbit, but that still makes it a bit more fun."}
{"text":"Food: Like the name says, it's burgers and fries. Mostly. Your options are: Hamburger, Cheeseburger, Bacon Burger, Bacon Cheeseburger, Hot Dog, Grilled Cheese, Regular Fries and Cajun Fries. They also offer \"little\" versions of the burgers, meaning one patty instead of two.

They offer up a list of toppings so you can create your own perfect burger: Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Green Pepper, Grilled Onion, Grilled Mushrooms, Pickles, Ketchup, Mustard, Relish, A-1 Sauce, Mayo, Jalapeno Peppers, Bar-B-Q Sauce and Hot Sauce.

The patties are always well-done. I generally prefer \"med-rare\", since most places that say \"well-done\" really mean \"drier than the Sahara\"  Not so here. I have never, never had a more juicy burger. It dripped. A Lot! And the flavor was simply fantastic. By far, it was the best burger I have ever had. It was a bit much to handle though as these are not small burgers. Getting your mouth from bottom bun to top is no small feat.

The fries were also fantastic. I like that they are freshly cut, actual potatoes and that they're fried up in peanut oil. There's a sign by the order counter that proudly proclaims where that days spud's arrived from. They come in two sizes \"regular\" and \"large\". I ordered the regular and ended up with a styrofoam cup filled with fries, plus two more large handfuls in the bottom of the bag.

Drinks: Standard fountain sodas.

Seating: Plentiful. They have tables and chairs, and plenty of them. There's also a bar table that runs the length of a back wall complete with stools.

Atmosphere: The place has bright white tile with red accents, various \"best of\" articles, mostly from the Washingtonian magazine and large red on white signs proclaiming their awesomeness. The lighting is bright, the walls are bright, and everything is brand-new-squeaky-clean looking. We'll see if it stays that way, serving the college crowd.

Staff: Very friendly

Miscellaneous: The first time I went here, I ordered my burger specifically without tomatoes. I'm allergic to them. When I got my food there was a bright red (very fresh looking) tomato merrily laying on my burger. I simply brought it back up to the counter and told them what the trouble was. The manager was completely cool about it and ran a brand new one out to me a couple minutes later.

They have boxes full of peanuts stacking in strategic locations in the restaurant, complete with little metal pails to carry a pile of peanuts to your table. If you have a peanut allergy, this is not the place to be. There's even a sign on the door that says so.

Overall: This is the way a burger joint is meant to be. Fast, Simple, Delicious. Watch out Dotty's, Five Guys will be giving you a run for the \"best burger\" in this years \"Best of Madison\"."}
{"text":"Good burgers but getting skimpy on fry portions. Getting pricey too. We spent $50 for a family of 5 just for burgers and fries, no drinks. You can go to a real restaurant for a few dollars more. Next time we willl."}
{"text":"Little expensive for a burger and fries, but it is a quality meal. Cajun fries are good and its always fun to watch the people try to figure out the soda machines. Has some hot dogs for kids as well. Even though the say all topping are free, when you are paying 8.00 for just a burger they are not free."}
{"text":"Had lunch here while in Pitt for the weekend. I enjoyed a double cheeseburger and fries, with a delicious mouth watering cherry Coca Cola. I think I may now have a new favorite fast food burger... :)"}
{"text":"Gotta love everything about Five Guys. It's always a toss up but half the time I order the hot dog . And the fries- yum-o!"}
{"text":"Good big burgers with heaps of toppings to choose from. Huge servings of fries! Only get one fries between two, I promise you won't need more than that.

Worth the money, I eat 5 Guys when I can."}
{"text":"if there was a way to rate this place zero stars i would, it is overpriced garbage, you can get a better meal for 1/3 of the price at in and out. i paid 15$ for a burger drink and fries, which is fine for a restaurant but a take out burger shop? $2.50 for a small fountain drink, and the cup even says \"best $5 burger i have ever eaten\" i grew to be a fan of this place in florida, where a meal costs $7 and the amount they try to charge for one of their mediocre burgers here is absurd! unless they change the prices i will never eat here again, they are basic burgers you can get at in and out and they charge 5x the price! save your money"}
{"text":"This post might be a little surprising because  I do enjoy five guys ! My two star review  has to do with the price . 
In the steelyard location,service is fast and friendly which is a pleasant surprise compared to the other steelyard services . 
I went for lunch about two weeks ago and spent 15$ for a double , small fires and a drink . That is 15$!!!!!! If you go to any restaurant in the Tremont or Ohio city area , there are only a few restaurants that have their best burgers priced over 15$ . 
Few days later I went to a local restaurant , had a bacon cheese burger , with local organic meat and everything made from scratch !!!!!!! For 12.50 $ ! 
The quality difference was huge. 
Five guys is good, but not 15$ a meal good ."}
{"text":"A lot of people had hyped this place up - so my sister and I took it for a spin. I was not wowed. It literally was just okay. 

My best description for it would be a cross between In-N-Out and Fatburger. Reasons why: Burger tastes like a fatburger patty. Large in size and similar consistency, except they don't have the topping I normally put on a fatburger (fried egg). Fries are an attempt at being similar to In-N-Out but fail. Tasted more like potato skin than potato and were overcooked.

On the plus side the place is bright, inviting, clean, and the workers are extremely helpful and polite.

I think this is just a matter of taste buds - you're either an In-N-Out fan or a Five Guys fan and I'm just an In-N-Out fan."}
{"text":"Wayyyyyy too fricken expensive. Like.... the average person can't afford to spend 25$ on 1 meal. This restaurant is ridiculous"}
{"text":"There aren't many places where you can get a Bacon Cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, grilled jalape√±os, Mayo & BBQ sauce.   If that's what you're into there's only one place to go."}
{"text":"Excellent:  charming service, clean and attractive, and of course the burgers and fries.
Could be better:  parking. 
We'll definitely go back. Thanks Fred!"}
{"text":"It was good but the fact that you can't look anywhere without seeing a sign that's force feeding you the idea, that this is the best burger ever is overwhelming, and a little needy. Ehhhh"}
{"text":"If you don't like Five Guys, you don't like hamburgers.

This is by far my favorite burger joint of all time.   I order a \"Little Cheeseburger\" with raw onions, pickles, and ketchup, and then I eat it while crying tears of joy."}
{"text":"Love using the app for a fast pick up, service here is always friendly, and have not had a bad burger! Keep up the great work, you all are fun and hard working!!"}
{"text":"Lack of customer service was hard to swallow. Repeated my order twice and the server still got it wrong.
Food was ok but way too expensive for what you get.Wont be going here anytime soon."}
{"text":"What's with the name?

I like the setting, I like the location, burgers are great. I'm not so crazy over these fries that have been praised so highly though, not sure what it is but they don't do it for me, they are just potatoes to me. Burger on the other hand, very tasty, if not steep price. I'd rate it well under Burger's Priest and Holy Chuck, but around yonge and dundas by far and away the best burger joint to hit up."}
{"text":"I love the burgers at Five Guys, in fact they may be my favourite burger of all time, but there are many things I really don't like. 
I know many will disagree with me but here goes. I hate their fries.  They are bland, tasteless and boring.  In fact I hate everything about them. The price is double what you pay anywhere else. And for everyone saying \"but you get free fries in the bag\" trust me, you don't.  You pay for everyone you get, in fact you pay for ones you're not getting.  I hate the fact they throw fries in the bottom of my bag. Can I please have a grease filled bag so I'm afraid of where to put it.  
Don't get me wrong it's clever marketing because everyone gets excited about the free fries in the bottom of the bag they overlook the price.  Two large fries from McDonald's are a penny cheaper then one small fries at five guys.    
I hate the fact that for two people to eat it is $30 and that is of course with you sharing fries. Other places it would be around $15 and you would each get your own fries. 

I hate that they only have two cup sizes for drinks. That's great for kids.  Do you want a large or an even larger size?  Or of course we can all just share a cup, we're already sharing the fries. 

By this point if I was reading this review I would be saying. Oh my god get over yourself and go somewhere else. And I agree with all of you, however, their burgers are incredible. They are fresh, flavourful and just delicious.   You only complain if you care. And I do care about these burgers. Just not the fries.....or anything else. 

My perfect fast food would be: Five guys burgers, Harveys milkshakes and McDonalds fries."}
{"text":"A pretty typical Five Guys experience, no significant complaints and we left well fed!  Service was fast and burgers made per expectations.  One of the peanut bins was missing the paper baskets so I moved half over from the one by the register.  Bathroom was clean and in good shape on my visit."}
{"text":"It's an In 'n Out Burger concept at 3 times the price. There are more toppings offered on the burger and larger patties, but in my opinion, In 'n Out provides better value and a fresher taste. Everything was tasty enough, but it is just burgers and fries. Same thing you can get almost anywhere."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a try \"which was the first mistake\" got a burger with bacon and cheese. Its amazing that how you can take a patty of beef and scare out all the flavor so it resembles something like ground up cardboard. The bacon seemed like it was sitting around for 3 days. I had to overpay for this ?????
I wont be back"}
{"text":"Love the burger, atmosphere, staff, music and most importantly FRIES! Their fries are the best quality. The staff also is really nice and always fill the bag with way more fries than the actual holder. 
The peanuts while waiting is a plus"}
{"text":"My rating says all about this place.  

I came here because I walk past it every time I walked on mill and heard mixed reviews about the place.  So I look in this place and think how it looks like the nock off version of In N Out, and I was right.

So here I am all tired and hungry and I see this shabby looking burger in front of me.  I take a bite and said \"this is the last time I come here when there is a fast food burger place, thats so much better, Ill go the extra .5 miles.

Recommendation: If you are so hungry and cant think of anywhere else to go, keep thinking of somewhere besides this place."}
{"text":"I went in for a burger, fries and a coke. I was hit with a 14.00 bill then I sat down to see what I paid $14.00 for. What I got was a bland hamburger and an excessive amount of fries for which I was charged $4 !! I won't be coming back. What a ripoff"}
{"text":"I ate at this trendy burger joint on Friday and thought it was sub-par. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not what I expected as far as how people built it up in my mind. A friend of mine was bragging about this awesome burger he had while on business in North Carolina. He was telling me it was called 5 guys burgers and blah blah blah. Thinking they were only a east coast joint, I was surprised and anxious to try it when I heard there were a few out here. 

I would recommend it, but if you want a really good burger in the same area, try Lenny's over on Stapley just south of Southern."}
{"text":"Most fast food places have introduced a pricier, fancier burger to their menu. McDonalds has the Angus Burger. Carl's Jr. has the Six Dollar Burger. They cost between $4 and $5 and include some fancy ingredients and maybe a bigger patty to help satisfy the more discriminating fast food connoisseur. But if you spend just $1 more at Five Guys, you'll get so much more burger. Much much more. The basic burger starts at $5.19, but you'll get two meat patties, along with your choice of condiments. You can also get grilled onions and mushrooms at no charge (hey, mushrooms aren't cheap). Definitely a huge step up from fast food, for just $1 more. You can probably find that underneath your seat cushions. If you wanted to keep your bill below $6, you probably won't be able to get their fries, but you can have a side of peanuts for free. Probably better for you, too. Taste-wise, the burger is most similar to Fuddrucker's, except $2-$4 cheaper."}
{"text":"Hands down best fast food burgers in town! I love the quality and freshness of their burgers. It's a little bit pricer, but so worth the money for the quality!

Ever since I discover Five Guys I have not look at any other fast food joints in town. Say goodbye to Mcdonals, Burger King and Wendy's!"}
{"text":"pounding down the bacon double cheeseburger with hot sauce onions and mushrooms as i type this mmmmm.....i give it 3 stars because i think the fries are REALLLLLLY overrated, i dont care for them at all, and i think the price is a little steep. Was a little over $12 for burger/drink/reg fries....id rather pay $12 for 2 burgers and leave the fries and drink off the bill (although 2 of these burgers would be like 14) 

Burger good, service cool, atmosphere clean and fast paced, fries suck."}
{"text":"best freakin burger ever!!
best soda machine ever!!!
a must eat!"}
{"text":"I was dying to try this place after reading some reviews on here, but I'm not that all impressed, I have to say.

This place is average at best. The burgers are almost the EXACT same as wendys when you order from the junior menu, and the jumbo burgers are simply too big to finish. The fries are very fresh cut PEI spuds, and was a great choice. The store even tells you where the potatoes are from, and the farm's name, which I thought was kinda neat. It's always nice to know what you're eating.

Value wise, there is no value here. You're paying a premium for a hand made burger, only to find out the patties are pre-made, and very small I might add. Even more shocking, a junior bacon cheeseburger is $6 and no bigger than a McDonalds Quarter pounder or a Wendys Bacon Cheeseburger, and the fries are $4 for a large (feeds 4 people minimum, seriously), and a drink is another 5$!?!?!

I feel like I was being raped in food fees like at the movies theatres, and cost me a whopping $16 for a burger, drink and fries. Not that impressed.

Burger wise, it was pretty sloppy made. Topping were spilling out the sides and my toppings werent even done properly. The meat was flavourless and completely artifical, and the cheese was processed. 

Complete fail. I'd never go back here. If you want good fries, find a chip truck.

What kind of burger joint in Canada has NO poutine?!?!?!

You heard me, this place has NO poutine. This fries and cheese cornicopia is a staple dish at Canadian burger places, and I'm perplexed why this wasn't being served.

Seating was incredibly cramped, and I felt like everyone was invading my personal space when I was trying to eat.

This place makes me scratch my head in disbelief. I was very disappointed. :("}
{"text":"The service was awesome they let my kid ring up the order and they were so kind to us. One of they workers that really took care of us was Colby. My daughter had so much fun ringing up the order. She can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great burgers!  It definitely fills you up.   You can add all kinds of ingredients like grilled mushrooms and grilled onions.  Fries maybe not my favorite but it's definitely better than in and out."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a burger but not your regular fast food, tasteless burger. I wanted pure goodness! Which I can only find at five guys. Any place with unlimited toppings & extra cheese is free is my kinda spot!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this chain gets such great reviews. Maybe their competition in other cities is worse than they are. 
It has the ambience of a subway station during off peak hours. Chairs look like they're made of wood, but are painted metal, so it's cold on the butt. Everyone that was eating in left their coats on as the place was cold. Acoustics are terrible and the place was littered with peanut shells. 
The burgers we ordered left lots to be desired. Once they were unwrapped they looked like they had been made using a hammer. All squished and misshapen. Certainly not appetizing. It could have been so much better.
The bottomless drink was decent. Split one with my date. 
Split an order of fries as well. That had to be the only good thing about this place. The fries were hot, and stayed hot in the container. They were crisp, not soggy and not too salty. We had the regular size, and it was generous. 
Next time, I'll just order the fries - for take out."}
{"text":"I'm giving a below average rating due to the service level and being out of a condiment on more than one occasion - NOT for the quality of the food.

I have been to this new Five Guys 5 times in the past 6 weeks.  Twice (last night and again about 2 weeks ago) - they were out of pickles.  How is a hamburger place out of pickles?  Go to the grocery store and grab a few jars so that you at least have some...who cares if they aren't your typical brand you use.   You should not run out of basic condiments and think it's okay.

Additionally, I've placed two orders for carry out - BOTH times, they have messed up my order.  I got home and all burgers were missing tomatoes (which on the receipt did say to add tomatoes).  The time before that, my to-go order was missing tomatoes and onions...They have a TON of people working there - surely someone can pay attention to what the orders ask for.  I spend $30+ and I expect to get what I ordered.  I should not have to double-check to ensure the toppings are on the burgers.  This is not rocket science.  And one time would be forgivable, but again, it's happened twice in about 3 weeks - so I'm sure it's not just my order.  They need to get it together at this new location.   In the meantime, double-check your orders if you get a carry out.  

Otherwise, SO much better than IN N OUT burgers -- which have the smallest patty of meat that you will ever see.  It's  a joke.  

I do wish Five Guys would offer a turkey burger!"}
{"text":"This 5 guys location is always consistent, the service is friendly and fast, and the portions huge. There is a children's menu and  a \"vegetarian\" option. A great place is you are craving greasy gigantic burgers and fries on the double."}
{"text":"I love this place especially because they offer options for people who don't want a burger. Hamburger meat doesn't sit well in my stomach so I get their veggie sandwich with cheese. AMAZING!
The fries are crispy and hot every time. They could move a little faster making everything but no complaints as far as quality."}
{"text":"In 'n' Out, I don't know how to tell you this, but . . . I've found someone else.  No, no, it's not like that, it was nothing you did!  Your burgers with their fresh toppings are delicious... but sometimes I just need a little change of pace, maybe something with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and bacon... mmm... bacon.  Oh, sorry.  You want to know the name?  I don't see why that...  You insist?  Okay... it's Five Guys.

Oh!  You're upset!  YOU'RE upset!  Well let me tell you what - Five Guys' fries are delicious, whether they come in Cajun OR regular!  And I NEVER liked your fries, In 'n' Out!  I just pretended to like them, but they're skinny, kind of limp, never flavorful, and you don't get very many.  Five Guys cuts 'em thick, salts them up, and pours an extra scoop into the bag, how do you like that!  And they give you FREE peanuts to munch on while you wait.  You never give me anything!

What?  No... you're right, Five Guys is a more expensive taste.  That's true, it is over $10 for a burger, fries, and drink, as opposed to your $5.  And I do have to park in a garage that loosely resembles a labyrinth designed by Escher.  But if you eventually make it up to the restaurant, they VALIDATE.  You have NEVER validated me!  Oh, that's right, you have surface parking, but don't try to pretend that's a feature with the temperature hitting 100!  You're ridiculous.

What's that?  Does Five Guys have milkshakes?  Uh... hm.  Milkshakes.  I never thought about that.  They don't.  Would you mind if I got my burger and fries from there and then came to you for the shake?  No?  Fine.  You're so overprotective and hyper-traditional sometimes.  Live a little.

I hope we can still be friends, In 'n' Out, but I just think I need to see other burgers.  Please don't pelt me with limp fries when I turn my back."}
{"text":"The first time I walked past this restaurant I thought, \"Oh, they have an In N Out here?!?\"  If you are going to create an In N Out knock off, why would you use the same red and white colors?  There are plenty of two-color combinations to choose from.  

The burgers are HUGE.  It's two patties and very messy.  It's also 700 calories and 20 grams of saturated fat!  Just the burger is about $5.  Get the \"Little Hamburger\" if you want something more normal size.  

I also got the large cajun style fries.  The fries are heavily seasoned, and not that fresh.  The fries are about $5 and are enough to share between about three people.  They also offer free peanuts.  

It would be nice if they had some dine-in trays, instead of only having take out hand outs.  The burger comes wrapped in aluminum foil and everything is placed in a bag. 

I like the happy music they play here."}
{"text":"Great food with a lot of portions, free peanuts while you wait for your food. It is pricey though compared to other places in the area"}
{"text":"Burger was good. But for the price, it should've come with fries and maybe a drink. The atmosphere was awful, the annoying county music too loud, everything amplified by the industrial design/decor. I saw an employee spill frozen fries on a filthy shelf near the ground and he proceeded to pick them throw them in the fryer, then sweep the shelf with a disgusting broom. Gross!"}
{"text":"Today, I ordered a little bacon cheeseburger with BBQ and extra pickles. I received a cheeseburger without bacon, BBQ, or pickles. I double checked the ticket to make sure it was recorded right, it was. The ticket was taped to my bag. The place wasn't busy, so the oversight can't be blamed on a rush of orders. It was just carelessness. This made me regret spending money here."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner with my husband on Saturday night. The restaurant was busy but not overly crowed which was a great surprise. Being our first time the cashier was helpful at explaining the menu. My husband decided he was in the mood for the double patty bacon cheese burger. I on the other hand chose the smaller cheese burger and added on the complimentary yummy mushrooms. We decided on a large order of Cajun Fries to share. My husband had yet to experience the fancy soda machine where he can create his own flavor beverage. I didn't believe he would be as impressed as I was the first time I tried, but he thought it was amazing and actually tried something new. I made cherry coke which was a-mazing!  The food was good. My husband commented that it was the best burger he had in quite some time, including in-and-out. The fries were tasting but the large was too large for the two of us. Perhaps snacking on the complimentary peanuts filled me up, but they were worth it. Overall I am sure we will be back there sooner rather then later."}
{"text":"Still haven't found a burger that beats Five Guys and I'm trying, trust me! Born in California and raised on In-N-Out, but converted to Five Guys.

6/24/16 update: I have now been to Flipside and the Rail, and I've gotta say that neither place really wowed me. They make excellent burgers, but I've had plenty of similar burgers elsewhere. Something about 5 guys gets me every time and it doesn't matter where in the country I am. There is something to be said about the consistency and addictive, drug-like qualities of a 5 guys burger."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys. Fast food fix, coming up! I get the little burgers because seriously, the regular two patty burgers are way too much for me. I love the Five Guys buns. Okay, seriously, how do you write a review of this place without laughing so hard you snort Pepsi on your computer screen? Yes, I'm leaving that sentence exactly as I found it. Because if I could go to the store and buy those hamburger buns, I would. A bun doesn't have to be a tasteless spongey presentation for the burger, it should have a flavor and be something you want to eat independently of the patty. If a burger is done right, then all the pieces individually are just as delicious as the combination. I'm aware I said seriously twice in this review. Cut me some slack, it's Wednesday. We're halfway through the week, guys."}
{"text":"Great Food! Great Service! We packed the place out with students/parents attending a conference at the Convention Center and Five Guys whipped through the crowd in lightning speed! Great atmosphere and an abundance of fries!!!"}
{"text":"Yum.  It's hard to stick to healthy and ethical/environmentally friendly food with places like Five Guys tempting me with their freshly made yet fast food burgers.  This location is nice and spacious, with the assembly line working hard to turn out orders promptly.  The number of options for toppings is great, and it's easy to customize your burger.  Just one bite of these burgers makes some of the food guilt go away."}
{"text":"One of the worst Five Guys I've ever been to. Ten times as slow as the one in south end. They have no idea how to do a lettuce wrap. Careless attitude, horrible service, and so incredibly slow. Fast food? Give me a break. In addition, they skimp on fries -- all this at 330 in the afternoon, the place was dead."}
{"text":"Great burger! Love the fact that you have so many  add on options for your 1 or 2 patty burger. The fries are good too... You can actually taste the potato, not just oil and salt. Overall with fries and a drink the cost for lunch is $10.00+ so it's not the cheapest place to grab lunch but I would have to say it's worth it. 

I've been to this site a few times and have had great service everytime."}
{"text":"best burger ever!!hands down five guys smashes in and out.free peanuts,mountains of fries and awesome toppings."}
{"text":"After reading all the hype when they first appeared here I was expecting to be knocked out, but it was just an average burger. I make 'em at home all the time."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Five Guys. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted and asked for my order. The wait time was under 10 minutes, so that was a plus. The atmosphere was also great because I felt welcomed. All of the workers were kind and seemed like they were happy to be at work. I received excellent customer service overall.

After I got my soft drink from the fountain, which was also a cool experience because it was different from any other soft drink fountain I've seen, I sat down and prepared to enjoy my food. I can easily say it was one of the best burgers I've eaten. The french fries were also delicious and everything just felt comfortable. I felt like I was eating at a local burger joint rather than a franchise. My meal came out to around $11, which wasn't bad at all for the quality. Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is quite big space for a burger place and its definitely convenient for students to enjoy better quality burgers than your 'Mc'D'. Although, I do have to agree with fellow yelpers that this place is quite pricey as well for two burgers (cheese, and cheese w/bacon, with one regular fries and drink) priced at just under $30! I may as well go to a restaurant to enjoy with tip payment to pay this scale for burger + fries.

The thing I like about the burgers were the topping varieties...Definitely better than 'Harvey's' and lots of burger places. The burger meat reminded me of 'Wendy's'! They add two pressed patties into your sauce and topping choice.

This place gets a 3.5/5 overall."}
{"text":"The burgers was ok they are too small not a lot of options to pick from they need better variety of burgers. No chili fries and fries weren't that good not a lot of seasoned plus they are to expensive rather go to best burger a lot bigger cheaper and the best fried"}
{"text":"The food is good and huge portions except for the soda. They don't tell you that it is a double burger and you don't need to order more than one order of small fries. The store has only been less than a week and it was very busy tonight. There was quite a wait for burgers.  Mighty expensive. Certainly not an every day spot, only for special occasion."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?? The real five guys in the States would die from embarrassment and annoyed that reviews on the walls belonging to a terrific chain are displayed in this place. Gee..where do we start? Fries are oversalted,greasy, overcooked.. Meat is ok but bland and the rest is just put together by unsupervised,untrained kids. Please, steal and throw away their cheese?"}
{"text":"After the first time coming here i was hooked..great job Five Guys. Customer service was excellent the place was clean and even though the place was crowded, i can understand why...the burgers and fries are mouth watering mmmmm so delicious"}
{"text":"All this hype and I was not  impressed. I have made my own burgers that taste just as good if not better."}
{"text":"I love this place.
Food is fantastic.  They don't do a crazy fancy gourmet burger...but they keep it simple, distill a burger down to the core ingredients and do it right.  Sometimes less is more, and these guys have that formula down packed.

They do not offer an incredibly wide selection of toppings or condiments.  But everything they offer is focused and goes well with how they prepare the burger.  The portions are large and burger is always consistently made.  You can expect the same experience each time you go there.

Word of warning: Their \"little burger\" is something like a 5oz patty.  The name makes it sound like a kiddy meal, but for some folks, the little burger is all you need!

The patty is flavorful and actually tastes like meat!  I come back here again and again.  It's less greasy than Burgers Priest, and has better quality meat and flavor than South Street Burger.  In fact, I prefer 5 guys burgers to Burger Cellar burgers.  It proves that there is no need to get fancy.  Something simple, focused and well done is all it takes.  These guys do it right.  It's doing old school burger diner experience properly."}
{"text":"New five guys in Henderson (great), Not so great service...Was the second person in store at 11am and placed my order for 2 burgers and fries...nothing out the way. (They do burgers and fries right). Wrong  1st. the person before me got his order. 2nd the person that came in behind me got her order. 3.person that came 5 min later got her order.  I spoke up and asked were is my (2 small hamburgers).  O  let me see your ticket????
(what). there is only 4 people in the restaurant and i was 2nd in store. (you took my order).
O  we lost your ticket???????---give me money back please (ok) no im sorry or anything.-just open cash draw and gave me money back (with a stupid grin on her face).
I left and got to corner and seen she shorted me on the refund???????????????had to go back and ask for the correct amount-(again no im sorry)--To top things off while im getting a refund some other employee was walking around asking the (2 customers) that were in there eating how was everything?????Hey  im over here with a issue and you aren't doing anything but being ?????????????????Help your customers that need help don't turn and walk away like im a problem....I paid for food and did not receive it? what am i doing wrong here?   Need a good Manager    (say im sorry i lost your ticket can i get you something else).  not just a dumb look like o well...."}
{"text":"Five guys has great burgers but they are expensive. They don't have combos so you have to buy fries and a drink separately. The drinks have free refills and their \"regular\" burgers come with two patties while their smaller burgers are just one patty. 

A regular cheeseburger, fries and a drink is around $16, but it is extremely filling. Their fries are in a container and they put an additional scoop in the bag! Although their burgers are yummy, there are other places I would go to eat burgers for cheaper. For the area it is located, it really is the best choice!"}
{"text":"Way too expensive for what it is. Burger and fries. Not anything spectacular either.  Staff was really nice which is a plus in this day and age. Parking is a nightmare.  Extremely small lot.
Peanuts while you wait because you will wait.  They were the best part of the deal. But would I go back? Absolutely not. I'll go right next door to Culver's and get a great burger much cheaper."}
{"text":"Took my wife Andrea and dogs Tucker, Jake and Corndog. Awesome burgers and crispy fries. More people need to try these."}
{"text":"I will make this real easy for you. 

Just go to in-and-out Burger if you don't want to feel gross and poor."}
{"text":"This location is a bit more narrow, space-wise, than the one I'm used to, but the food is just as good and the service is efficient and friendly, as usual.  It's a great place to stop in for a customized burger of higher quality than that of what's in the food court nearby.  The fries are really good too, it's just that I usually can't fit them in my stomach by the time I've finished my burger."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive:
Cajun fries were pretty flavorful and fresh, neat red and white decor and I like the fact that true to the name \"Five guys\", there were exactly 5 guys cooking the burgers lol.

The choice of toppings were pretty good, much more than In & Out. You could choose grilled mushroom, grilled green pepper, onion, relish, A1 sauce, BBQ sauce, lettuce and other toppings you can think of.

The negative:

The patty did not melt in your mouth when i took a bite into it. The patty actually crumbled pretty fast, and was plain tasting. The bun was not that special either. For the relatively higher price for it's fast food burger, I was quite disappointed in it. I still think Shake Shack in New York and In & Out tastes alot better."}
{"text":"Any place that gives you the option of choosing 16 topping for your burger (at no additional cost) is automatically worth a try.

Besides that, there wasn't anything too exciting about these burgers. But don't get me wrong, I did enjoy my 7-topping burger and cup of fries.

:^D"}
{"text":"I got the \"little\" cheeseburger all-dressed, and that was filling enough with the complimentary peanuts. The regular is double the size! Fries were pretty good. Most of my group didn't even get to finishing their fries though because the burger was so filling.

The burger itself was all right and full of flavor, but it was extremely soggy and simply didn't stay put together, making the burger taste soggy and mediocre overall. It was extremely pricey though, way more than what I'd want to pay for a burger. $9 for a \"little\" cheeseburger is a bit much.

I'll probably end up coming back here when I'm craving an American burger though. Didn't think I'd find one of these outside the States!"}
{"text":"They give a decent portion of fries but that's all I have to say that's good about, Five Guys might use \"fresh ingredients\" and cook their fries in peanut oil but it really doesn't make the sandwiches worth the money you pay for them. The topping list is minimal so if you're looking for something wild or exotic then I'd avoid it. Moreover, the patties themselves are flavorless and the employee's will tell you that it's just plain old ground beef without any spices. For this cost I'd expect prime beef at least. To finish my review I'd like to mention that after speaking with two employees at this location, they were more than forthcoming about their poor treatment by management. Kids, if you're looking for a job maybe try McDonalds. My next burger will be from Burger Priest, forget these guys."}
{"text":"Great Five-Guys hamburger day!!! Great food and great service at the Flamingo location!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong having lunch at 5 Guys. The burgers are fantastic. You'll get all the fries you can handle and then some, and that's if you order a small. 

Only a few places in the world are good enough to set out vinegar for their fries. This one gives you two types to choose from."}
{"text":"I -had- to try Five Guys tonite, and well....I'm glad I did, for many reasons.

Yes, I'm an In-N-Out gal, there's nothing better than a Double-Double, animal style, no tomato and the fries WELL done. HEAVEN.

Pros: Five Guys had -one thing I liked: The cajun seasoning for the fries. Mainly hot paprika, and salt, but it was a very enjoyable flavor. It all went downhill from there, sadly.

Cons: A -greasy- burger, no matter how much the propaganga on the walls tells you otherwise. (the little reviews/write-up from mags, all along the walls. The one i'm referring to it the article nearest the bathroom.) The meat has very little flavor. The \"juiciness\" they brag about was just oozy grease, so be warned! The toppings I chose: grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce, pickles and mustard. I ordered the bacon cheseburger, for those of you curious. The mushrooms? They use -canned- button mushrooms; those godawful slimy, discusting things with little flavor but of what I like to think of as ASS. A BIIIGGG thumbs-down for using such a gross item; it took away from any potential tastiness of the burger, and I ended picking them all off, after 2 bites.

The fries: Wow. TOTAL let-down, but for the seasoning. They were soggy, limpy, greasy, PARTIALLY UNCOOKED, and the worst french fries i've EVER had in my life. They also cook them in peanut oil, so they have a unique 'tang' to them that I did not care for in the least.

In-N-Out has NOTHING to worry about, this place isn't even -close- to being a contender for a good burger joint!"}
{"text":"Very clean inside. Burger was juicy but just a burger. Had to try one after viewing YouTube. Videos on great burgers. The cashier offered me a water cup. I didn't have to ASK for one. Most places you have to and this girl was on top of it. Thank you Marisela B."}
{"text":"Walked in with 3 of my buddies and we each ordered an all dressed hotdog, all dressed double burger, fries and soda. The burgers are big and delicious and the dogs were cut down the middle and also tasted like heaven.  I don't know what's in the food but I'm definitely going back.

The only downside is that for a \"burger\", \"dog\" and \"fries\" it seems a little pricey but not by the time you're done eating!"}
{"text":"Yummy yum ! I ordered the little cheeseburger and cajun fries....It was really well done...I luved it and will go back soon...someday when the craving for burgers and fries strikes again !!"}
{"text":"Super cute place. Very inviting. Walked in got greeted and ordered our food. Sat outside, enjoyed our burgers and fries with the wonderful view of Kent State. The burgers and fries were made perfect. Can't wait to bring my son here next time I come back!"}
{"text":"It is by far the best available burger in Newmarket and the GTA, They do the burgers to order, have the largest fries portions in the city and a very simple menu. If you are in need of a greased up burger, fries and pop then head straight here. If you want a veggie burger or some turkey patties or health food Hero burgers will meet your needs better. 

The service here is good, you order at the counter, there are free peanuts to keep you occupied while you wait, they fill the bag with fries and the burgers come with as many toppings as you want. Also the cajun fries are a must!"}
{"text":"Way to go Five Guys Burgers and Fries putting cheese on my dairy free allergy alert burger. And FYI Five Guys Burgers and Fries your Westgate Mall 44116 location manager, Brittany, wouldn't even give me a refund. I even attempted to scrap off the cheese and still can't take the risk to eat it. Shame one you stating the company/employees is/are allergy aware. Lost me as a customer. The worst part is that she acted as if I was lying to get a refund! I don't care about the $10 I just won't ever trust your location to make my food again! The North Olmsted location is so much more careful and accommodating!! So insulting that the manager, Brittany at the Westgate mall location acted as if I was lying for a refund!"}
{"text":"After checking out the reviews and pic's couldn't wait to chk. This Burger Joint, love the peanuts .. Yes and the soda machine. ..experience that at Tom Thumbs BBQ....I love the burger had a small bacon cheese burg...good bun usually go pro..style ....Cajon Frys..saved some for breakfast with eggs..!!! ;)))))))) Yum, Yum....!!!"}
{"text":"BEST BURGER.  Ever. 

Free peanuts, good prices & awesome portions.  Their little burgers can be 5 inches in thickness if you tell them to put on lots of stuff."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan.

To say the burgers are out of this world is silly.  Half the point of coming here is to customize what you want how you want it.  While this may be a rip-off for some might be a steal for another.  Plus, it's pretty hard to screw up a burger; it's also pretty hard to excel at a burger.  Here is no different.

So let's talk about what makes this place great.  What you might not get in quantity of burger, you surely make up for it in how much fries you get.  The cup is just a formality as there's enough for two or three adults.  Is that a part of their business design?  Maybe, but at the very least it's a part of their excellent service.  They are super courteous and friendly.  Best of all, they make it sound like they're having fun.  That always leads to a better product.  Also I dare any fast burger joint to actually come to my table and ask how I like my food.  Well these (Five) guys sure took me up on it."}
{"text":"Had the cheeseburger. Comes with two patties and I added grilled onions and mushrooms. They grilled it fresh and didn't take too long. 

Burger was moist, cheesy and the toppings were portioned well. No extra lettuce like other places. My whole group was satisfied and full. 

Impressed. Will definately be back for more."}
{"text":"The burgers were great!  French fries were good too.  Didnt like the distraction of the employees shouting out at frequent intervals. Whats the point?  It was annoying. Other than that it was a good experience."}
{"text":"The best example of \"you get what you pay for\" ever. Sure, it's twice the price of McDs, but this is hands down the best burger and fries you're gonna eat (in Canada, anyway). Split fries between 2 friends and then gorge on beautifully made food. I could rave on and on..."}
{"text":"Love the 5-Guys (see my review on the outlet on McGill Street)

I'm writing this brief critique - to help other choose which 5-Guys to go to.

One can't go wrong with a good burger - not this burger - but given that this outlet is on St. Catherine's street (strategically?) located next to a strip club (not that there's anything wrong with that!) - expect long lines at the counter and a wait being half a dozen young, often loud, guys and gals. That's totally ok - but if this isn't your type of scene, try the outlet on McGill street - it's cleaner, and you'll have much more enjoyable time savouring this culinary decadence!

Dine at life's buffet friends!"}
{"text":"Burger was awesome. However, I went to use the restroom and when I pushed the door open, the door was so sticky my hand got stuck on it.  

Don't get me wrong, the food was awesome."}
{"text":"If I could have giving more stars I would have. Besides the food always being on point they give the most customer service. They saved my Valentines day for me and my husband. My husband is really a simple guy so this made his day. I took to long to pick up our order, so the food was cold when I got there. Do you know they remade our order at no extra charge. I didn't catch the two guys name but just for them doing that they got a customer for life... Hands down the best best place in Vegas."}
{"text":"The ownership of this place is fantastic.  I came in tonight and unbeknownst to me at the time my bank thought there was fraud on my card and they blocked it so it kept declining.  I didn't have cash on me and was about to leave but the awesome owner bought my dinner and told me not to worry about it.  Great guy that runs this Five Guys. Next time I come in I'll have to tip the jar big.  Really awesome experience.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! A really nice little diner with over the top burgers. I'm not usually a burger person but this place is definitely an exception."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need a good cheese burger. It definitely hit the spot today. The fries are great too. Got in and out quickly for lunch. Burger was still hot when I got back to the office."}
{"text":"Ok. Nothing to crave. Fries fantastic. Don't park on Mill the birds will decorate the outside of your car."}
{"text":"I find that being new they should try to attract customers not do the opposite. They charge 7/8 bucks before tax just for the burger!! i was shocked that didnt come with fries or a drink! companies are getting so cheap and a rip off.. Also I could have gone to the pickle barrel and gotten hamburger fries and coleslaw at a better price in a sit down resturant!! will not be returning for these prices. Also, they say free toppings...ok but expect, fries or a drink would be better then 2 pickles, piece of lettuce and half a tomato slice!"}
{"text":"I really like the options for toppings on the burgers, but skip the fries.  The burgers have great flavor...I love the bacon, mushrooms, green peppers and barbecue sauce!  The fries taste like mush.  Yeah, a little more pricey then some other burger joints, but it was good.  Don't forget that the regular burger has two patties....this may be a surprise if you haven't been here before.  I would stop by again, if/when in the area."}
{"text":"I got a bacon cheeseburger and fries. I was a little put off by the $15,23 total however I feel I got good value for it. The burger had two fresh patties that were juicy and held together, You also get whatever you want on it for free. The fries were a little too salty, but they give you a ton and are excellent. They really pop when you bite into them without being too crispy on the outside. Its a lot of potato in every fry.

I ate the burger and about 1/2 of the fries. I was full for the rest of the day. If I want a burger fix and am too lazy to cook one I will definitely go back to 5 Guys."}
{"text":"Good food but way too expensive.$$$

One single cheeseburger
Grilled cheese
Medium fry
2 small drinks
$19.50

Sure they over serve the fries, that's why there's only one medium.

Really almost $10.00 each for my son and I.
$2.39 for a soda, come on.  I know you have to pay for the fancy coke dispenser but really? 
In n Out burger- almost half the price"}
{"text":"I need a cheeseburger once and awhile, but I hate getting the burgers from restaurants where you can tell they were frozen paties, sitting in the freezer for who knows how long. I don't have my a grill anymore, so finding a good burger is not an easy task! My friends recommended Five Guys to me and I was not disappointed!! A great burger and lots of hot french fries - super delicious!! The service was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"OMG!  This place is soooooo good!  I had a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, mayo, mushrooms and pickles.  And fries.  The burger was delicious but it was too big to finish it all.  The fries were the best I've had.  Keep doing what you're doing!  It was great!"}
{"text":"These are the best casual-food burgers I've had... but I had \"fast food\" written there first which would definitely be wrong. I get a little annoyed at them taking 15 minutes to make a burger in a place that has a less charming interior than McDonalds. The long wait time is the only thing that stops me from going here more than twice a year or so.

It's hard to find a clean table here, as well. Fries are very good but annoyingly large portions."}
{"text":"I really like their burgers! But this location is horrible! The line is long, and the sitting area is a nightmare. My husband and I manage to get a seat but the seats were so close together and there was hardly any space to walk around so I was constantly getting bumped into while sitting down."}
{"text":"Not worth the price.  The burgers patties are small and during this visit were overdone - dry.  The french fries while plenty are usually over salted.  Considering the price for a fast food joint, I expect a lot more in terms of quality and consistency."}
{"text":"Trust me the burgers are not pretty, tailored or cute. It's juicy, drippy and messy. You need 2 (sometimes 3) hands along with several napkins to eat these burgers but omg its the best dam fast food burger I've ever eaten! I don't eat burgers very often so when I do, I make it worth it. To be honest I've only ever tried the burgers, so I can't comment on any other menu items. Due to the layout of the store, you can see the kitchen staff cooking, I like that. It's kind of pricy so for the occasional treat I don't mind paying a bit more."}
{"text":"My first time here. Burgers were very good, I like all the condiments right down to the jalapeno peppers. The fries however were a little soggy for my palate although they were abundant.  I would go back for a burger and might give the fries another try."}
{"text":"Five Guys is five star stuff. Their average burger is two patties with a warm sesame seed bun, on top of any and all toppings that you can imagine (if you so choose). The fries alone are worth the visit....and they give you a TON of fries, so go with a friend! 

It might be a little pricier than your average burger joint, but you get what you pay for...and it's worth it. Don't even think about missing out on this food. GO!"}
{"text":"Five Guys is the best fast food burger you can get period.

 I don't care for their fries.  Also, they will also make you anything you ask for as long as it uses the ingredients they have on hand."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and loved it both times, definitely a quick and dirty meal before catching a flick at the movies nearby.  The meat is fantastic, as others have said, it's sort of a fast food chain burger with a mom and pop taste.  The fries are pretty good, the first time I went I felt they were a tad undercooked.  The second time they were darker and had a much better flavour.  They do literally take two scoops and throw them in the bag, I love that! Best way to eat it is to tear the bag open and munch away.  i could never eat a large fries here and I'm a fry fanatic.  I can't wait till they buckle and offer poutine.  Johnny's burgers is terrible, this place owns it.  I would still say T-Bones has a better homeburger but this hits the spot!"}
{"text":"I don't eat red meat, but I am a french fry freak.  They have the best fries and if you are new, get a small because they throw in a handful on top of the order.  I love that they offer grilled cheese and I can get as many toppings as I like on it.  Fave: A-! and pickles.  The boyfriend loves the bacon burger."}
{"text":"The food was great but i have never seen such terrible management. I was with my friend eating in and some manager with blue hair had the nerve to pull out an employee and yelled at her right in front of us while we were eating in the dining room! How unacceptable, I mean, that is low. right in front of other customers in the dining room? pathetic and low. Instead of taking the young girl in the back away from customers she put the employee righton the spot and scolded her in front of EVERYONE. It was terrible and uncalled for and we felt so bad for the employee. She was in tears. That is unacceptable. If you continue to have this unprofessional so called 'managers' work at this location, I will never go back. That was very irresponsible and unprofesional of  that manager (we couldn't get a name, but she had a grey shirt and blue hair, i will find out the name though!). You need new management at this location. this is not the first time we have seen management her do stupid s**t.. we just like to give people chances and benefit of the doubt, well, not anymore! I will also tell others to not go to this location until changes are made. I hope you take our comment into consideration, if not, then you guys just don't care"}
{"text":"Even anti-fast-food foodies will enjoy a meal at 5 guys!

Bare bones menu, fast service, and well prepared grub - makes for the ultimate fast-food combo.

Atmosphere: 5-Guys Hamburger is a the fastest growing fast-food chain in America (2010/2011) due to their no-nonsense approach to fast food.  Unlike to-remanin-unnamed international fast food franchises who have a menu consisting of 101 items in a failed attempt to please everyone, 5-Guys is unabashed by its offering of the Hamburger.  5-Guys Burger is like that really self-confident member of any group; he/she could be wearing a pink sock and a white too-too and still be down to going out and having a ball - no shame.

Service:  Haven't had bad service yet, the guys and gals working there tend to be older i.e. college age as opposed to high school etc.  They seem to work well together - training (?) - giving them a sense of togetherness not often found at fast-food joints.  This translates into quick and correct service for the consumer.

Food: With or without cheese, with or without bacon, regular size or small ... simple.  Oh you want a hot-dog, ok fine - they throw that in there on the menu.  Fries? Ok salted or cajun (get cajun!).  Even better the portions are incredibly generous and often times the cooks just make your order a double just to be funny ~ love that.  The toppings are fresh (onions, lettuce, tomato, jalape√±o,  etc.) and it hard not to ask for all of them!  The buns is what really pulls the whole mean together.  They shrink a little bit due to being more buttery than ordinary buns and melt right into the meat, cheese, and sauces of the burger so that when you bite into your meal, you'll have to watch out not to bit into your own fingers! (not that you'll care at that point - this burger is that good!)

Complimentary peanuts on the house and free drink refills - so watch out! Go and enjoy when you're feeling a little food-naughty :O)

Burger patties are juicy and flavorsome and the staff is friendly, always delivering your order with a smile. There is a good list of condiments which should satisfy most but don't expect anything too fancy. You can snack on free peanuts while you wait for your food, which can take 5 to 10 minutes around lunch time. Will go again!"}

Not that spendy, $30 for 3 double burgers, 3 drinks and a large fry.  Burger is worth the extra couple bucks.  Try it if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious, delicious!

The quality of their burgers is wonderful. I ordered a cheeseburger with mayo, mushrooms and onions. The bun is soft and sweet, the meat is flavorful, condiments were tasty. I used to love Fuddruckers burgers, but honestly this place takes the cake... er, the meat patty. The facility itself is clean and inviting. The staff was hospitable. No complaints here. The price may shun some people, but it's really not that expensive. You get what you pay for and even more in my opinion. You get a quality burger that tastes great. If you're looking for a cheap, previously frozen, premade burger type place, I can give you the directions to the nearest Mcdonalds and you can order a $1.00 Mcdouble.

I wasn't a huge fan of the fries but I'm a tad bias since I don't like spice. It seems like they toss the fries with a spicy seasoning so it's too much for me (I'm the girl who can't even eat a bag of Andy Capp's Spicy fries without chugging on some milk). If you like that cajun side of fries, then you will probably be a fan of these.

All in all, definitely a great place for burgers. You can customize your burger to your liking with whatever condiments they offer. Pretty good in my book."}
{"text":"J'ai test√© Five Guys peu de temps apr√®s son ouverture sur la rue McGill. Un menu tr√®s simple: des burgers! Le service peut √™tre un peu lent, surtout sur l'heure du lunch. J'ai trouv√© les hamburgers savoureux, mais √† ma deuxi√®me visite j'ai trouv√©  mon hamburgers un peu trop \"graisseux\" (greasy). Je suis une amateure de frites, mais je n'ai pas particuli√®rement ador√© celles de chez Five Guys. Elles sont croustillantes, mais la cuisson dans l'huile d'arachide n'est pas ce que je pr√©f√®re. Mais elles sont quand m√™me bonnes et fra√Æches.

Les ++ : hamburgers juteux, savoureux. viande de qualit√©

Les ---:  pas de trios offerts donc prix assez √©lev√©s car il faut tout acheter individuellement, service un peu lent, burgers qui baignent un peu trop dans leur graisse. Personnellement, je d√©teste la poutine mais ne pas offrir de poutine dans un restaurant de hamburgers au Qu√©bec, c'est tr√®s dommage car c'est cela qui nous diff√©rencie!

Bref, √† essayer pour les amateurs de hamburgers, mais le Harvey's fait √† mon avis d'aussi bon burgers!"}
{"text":"Good food but I think it's over rated. I've had better food but I think it's because hey give you a massive amount of fries and that gets around to friend. Make sure you order a small for two people to share."}
{"text":"this was my first time having Five Guys, and i have to say, it was pretty good.  i still think i like in-n-out more overall, but this is a very good burger.

the good:
- tons of toppings you can choose from, and some of the stuff is stuff that isn't offered at most places like green bell pepper which i thought was pretty cool.  
- the burger was cooked very well and was still very juicy
- the staff was very nice and helpful
- the cajun fries are really good (fries were much better than in-n-out fries)
- huge options for sodas and a really cool soda dispensing machine


the things i didnt' like (not that it was bad, just didn't please me):
- the grilled onions were not very grilled
- the menu is a little odd because they don't say a regular burger is 2 patties, they just say burger so it is a little misleading
- jalapenos were not very spicy


overall, if there is one near by, i would definitely stop again as i enjoyed it, but i don't think i would go out of my way to stop by"}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about this restaurant I was quite excited to try it out. Wasn't busy when I went and we didn't have to wait too long. Ordered a bacon burger with some toppings, wasn't bad but wasn't anything spectacular as I expected it to be. The bacon was over cooked a little bit but the fries weren't bad. If near by, I wouldn't mind going back but it isn't a first choice."}
{"text":"Again another place people rant and rave about. I won't disagree with ya'll but eh it could have been better.

To me, it's a fancier In & Out. Yes I thought the burger was quite tasty but good lord the price! I appreciate the fact that yes you can make the burger however you want without being charged for extra toppings. Great idea! But why add toppings when the burger can't even stay together? You end up using a fork to eat your burger. However, nothing like a juicy double patty with cheese in your mouth beats any other of the fast food joints. 

The cajun fries are awesome but a bit soggy, some were overseasoned and talk about cup overload. I know we live in an obese society but does someone really eat that much fries? We shared a large and still couldn't finish them.  

Now the biggest marketing ploy for 5 Guys are their bins of free peanuts while you wait. If allergic to peanuts, this probably isn't the place for you. It is better than Fuddruckers but a for 2 burgers, lrg fry and drink, why would I pay $25? So the search continues for the best burger in the valley...would it be wrong to say that Kilroy's really does have good burgers? haha"}
{"text":"Poor service from the cashier and the manager. They ran out of ice. I already paid for my meal and wanted to get ice with my drink. The manager said they would not fill up the ice because they were too busy. She refused to refund my money. I had to get back to work and did not want to fight about a cup of ice. The Burgers are over priced. They have the worst fries I've tasted.I called back to try to speak to a manager. They said they could not help me."}
{"text":"Their burgers are ok. they kind of taste like a homemade burger (which is awesome) however, the prices are outlandish. They don't have combos so you have to buy everything \"A la carte\". Basically, if you want a burger, fries and a drink it will cost you around $15 which I find is pretty expensive. I've gone to mom & pop burger places that have had better quality and prices. The portions are pretty big but too much for the average person to eat in one sitting. The cheese tastes processed and a little bit like plastic. lastly, the wait times are a little long. Every time I've gone in there I've waited at LEAST 14 minutes for my food. I wouldn't recommend if you are looking for something very quick during your 30 minute lunch break."}
{"text":"The menu is almost completely devoid of non-beef options the only options are a veggie sandwich and grilled cheese. You have to buy fries separate from your sandwich, which in this instance were very salty. The food is served in a brown bag, sandwich at the bottom and french fries right on top of it. The sandwich is ok at best, same with the service. If you are looking for a broader menu this is not the place to come to.

UPDATE: I changed my review from 2 to 3 stars because one of the employees asked how everything was and when we mentioned the fries were very salty he have us a $10.00 gift card and offered new fries. That was very much appreciated"}
{"text":"Seasoning!! Patties are in desperate need of a little salt and pepper.  If you're going to charge premium prices you have to at least get the basics right.  I gotta say this place is pretty similar in taste to Wendy's but 50% more $$."}
{"text":"I absoluetly do not eat hamburgers out if we ever go to a burger place i always order chicken sandwhiches but i decided to give this place a try and OH WOW it was so goooood everything is fresh the fires are great mmm will def go again and again and again"}
{"text":"The best!!! It'll take awhile for their grills to get properly used and seasoned like their older chains on the east coast but it's already really good! Grab some free peanuts and vinegar for your fries! :)"}
{"text":"Four stars for the burgers and the multitude of topping options!  One of the best bacon cheese burgers I've had...added green peppers, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato and barbecue sauce.  mmmmmm.  Now lets talk about the fries--I recommend not ordering them.  Save room for the burger.  The flavor is only okay, and they are real greasy and soggy.  Oh, yeah for those of you who enjoy eating shelled peanuts, you can snack on those while you're waiting for your order number to be called.  Service is pretty quick though.  

I'm getting hungry just thinking about the bacon cheese burger! :)"}
{"text":"Quick lunch service, everyone very friendly, food came out fast and correct. Great tasting food, fun to mix your own drinks, and very-very-very clean!! Keep up the good work Five Guy's crew!"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but does not worth its price,15$ for a cheeseburger? I'd rather go to McDonald's."}
{"text":"They Just have the best burgers, period! Seriously. Fresh cut fries. I mean. Come on."}
{"text":"My husband chose Five guys for his birthday lunch.  I usually do not eat the bun with burgers but I decided to cheat since it was his birthday. The owner came over and asked how we liked our burgers and I advised him It was amazing especially the bun.  I said it's probably because I hadn't eaten bread in so long, but even still GREAT!  He said a great healthy alternative is their BLT.  He described it and I agreed it sounded good. The next thing we knew he showed up at our table with a BLT for free.  I thanked him and he said it was ultimately a selfish act as he knew I'd be hooked. HE WAS RIGHT!  I have NEVER had a BLT like this.  I wanted to finish it so badly, but I couldn't.  I know they are known for the burgers and fries, but if you like BLT's you need to try their version.  Excellent service, great music, and peanuts for free!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here I had a bad experience. The burger was super greasy and the fries were cold and soggy. So I decided to give it a shot again. The burger was a little better this time, but still dripping with grease. And again the fries were cold and soggy. And if you plan on eating here make sure you the only thing you have planned after is to go home to take a shower. You and you cloths are going to smell like greasy food. For paying close to $15 for a burger, fries, and a drink you would think for you enjoy your meal. And it would be very expensive for a family to dine here. The service wasn't very friendly, and it's way to loud to have a conversation with anyone. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"The reason they get such a high rating is because I ALWAYS get the same serivce and same quality of burger. There is never an instance I am not hapy with this place. 

PERFECTION, oh yes!"}
{"text":"Very slow service and not convenient.  Ordered online, went to store and waited on a no bun burger for about 20 min."}
{"text":"I went in here a few days ago with my mother and I'd have to say that it was really good. It was a little cold in there but I didn't really mind it as much. The food was good and came really quickly. The regular fries are huge and I was able to split it with my mother and still have some left overs. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The guys behind the counter were really friendly and took the time to explain the menu to us. I'm not a big peanut fan but having the peanuts there was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great burger and the best fries I have had since moving to the USA almost 11 years ago. Friendly staff, clean establishment."}
{"text":"Wowza. The only reason I did not give this place five stars is because the prices are ludicrous ($9.03 CAD for a cheeseburger? 4 realz?) and they kinda screwed up my order (in a good way though)... but I did not have room for fries in my tummy & I f*cking hate Maalox so I politely declined the line cooks' offer to \"just take it, it's on us. When you serve 100 people in 5 minutes you tend to lose track of things every once in awhile.\"

Sadly, I like my fries extruded or batter-coated with spices like KFC's or Burger King's & fried twice for crispiness if need be. My sister and her friend beat me to losing their Five Guys virginity & told me their fries have a tendency to get soggy. No wonder. They serve it in soft drink cup-style vessels with no vent holes, inadvertently steaming the fries sitting anywhere near the middle or bottom of the container. 

Another thing I couldn't understand: Five Guys fries is fried in peanut oil (they had more than half a dozen 20-litre? buckets stacked up in close proximity to their humongous fryolators) & there are peanut shells littered all over the floor in some franchises (encouraged by the company or the handiwork of asshole diners? Can't say. I have the research skills of a fruit fly) so, uh... ANAPHYLAXIS ALERT! Don't touch anyone who's been to Five Guys if you left your EpiPen at home.    

The grilled bun became flat and soggy but it couldn't be helped 'cuz the burger was huge and the toppings weren't stacked any lower. It was very generously-sized. I busted a tiny scab on my left cheek for virtually unhinging my mandible to take a decent bite. Almost worth the $9.03. Almost. I just can't justify spending $9.03 (even for a combo) but for a single cheeseburger? 'GASP.' Miraculously nobody had to do the Heimlich manoeuvre on me. Odds of getting a coronary from the food are a lot slimmer than from panicking at the shameless gouging taking place at this establishment!

That cheeseburger was a f*cking festival in my gullet though. It made me so goddamn happy. Easily the best burger I've tried in Toronto thus far. I wish there was a Canadian burger joint this good. That thing they do with sandwiching the cheese slice(s) between two thin fresh-off-the-grill patties to form a beautifully thick, perfectly melted cheese-centered patty/grilled cheese with cow instead of bread? GENIUS! I could kiss all FIVE GUYS for coming up with that."}
{"text":"I was craving a good burger, so I went to five guys. The customer service here is great. As soon as I walked in the door, someone greeted me. They took my order and invited me to enjoy the free peanuts while I waited. The staff is very friendly and if you're looking for a very good burger this is the place to go.
I suggest you order the small fries. It will fill you up. They fill up the little container and then add another scoop of fries right into the bag. You will never leave hungry."}
{"text":"I eat here 4 times a week and I must say it is amazing. But then again my digestive issues and high cholesterol levels may be the result of that."}
{"text":"Great burgers and awesome fresh cut fries.  I love being able to configure my burger the way I like it.  Staff is always friendly and provide excellent service.  And another fun thing to experience here ... listening to the young staff attempt to sing (or should I say butcher?) along with classic rock hits from the 60's and 70's."}
{"text":"The burger was average and the service was good but for the price I wouldn't come back. They aren't exceptional burgers I would rather go to In-N-Out honestly. And j was disappointed by no sauce or ranch.."}
{"text":"First time to Five Guys. Mark & Brian (radio) used to talk about their burgers all the time...definitely as good as they said! Shawna was the cashier; she was super helpful with our big-ish order, smiling the entire time. I do want to make note that a regular has two patties (but you can ask for a single). 
I really like that you choose each topping/condiment from mayo to grilled onions to bacon...and it's all free, er...included. The cajun fries are UH-MAZINGLY good! The restaurant was very clean. The only downside is that they don't offer milkshakes but that's an observation not a reflection of stars."}
{"text":"Really good burgers and the Kosher hot dogs r bomb...friendly staff and clean place...the grilled onions make the burger for sure and no condiments on the Kosher dog is the way to go"}
{"text":"The BEST and most HELPFUL place for gluten allergens! You can actually have french fries with your burger for once!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, but more costly than most burger joints.  Everything tastes fresh and the staff is wonderful.  Be prepared to pay more than expected...O well!"}
{"text":"went late last night. The place was totally empty. But the guys working were super friendly. I had the bacon cheese burger with grilled onions and mushrooms, plus the reg fry. The fries were gigantic, hot, and delicious. The burger was good, not great . The bun ok. Bacon amazing. So I guess the bacon and fries were the highlight. For the price I think I could find better. saying that I would still return"}
{"text":"This is the most amazing hamburger this side of the sun. I pound it on the reg, and and eat an occasional burger."}
{"text":"Impressive.   Destroys IN-N-OUT!!!  Best burger I've tasted.  Cashier and crew,  are top notch.   Fresh everything.  Fries awesome.   Bacon fresh."}
{"text":"I was severely disappointed by my experience at Five Guys.  With all the hype that this chain has garnered, I found that little of it held up.  As soon as I walked in the door I was overwhelmed by the smell of smoke that the griddle was wafting through the restaurant.  There were plenty of people cooking and preparing the food, yet it all looked chaotic and unorganized.

Just as other people have mentioned, you can choose a whole array of toppings to customize your burger.  That capability is great as long as the cashier rings up your order correctly (which mine was not).  Needless to say I was less than thrilled that I had to battle the smoke so that I could re-explain to the counter staff how my meal was supposed to be prepared.  Along with my burger, I also ordered the regular-sized Cajun fries.  These were definitely fully-seasoned, so if you are averse to spice don't order them.  The regular order of fries turned out to be a modest cup of fries stuffed in a brown bag full of more fries.  It is almost as if Five Guys' strategy is to overwhelm you by their generosity with their fries, so that you forget that their burger is mediocre and their fries are sopping wet with grease.  

The AYCE peanuts were good though; it is a shame that these were the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"I went in with my cousin and I was thinking the price is going to kill me.  Once my food got to me I surprised to see how big the burger was and it was definitely worth the money!  

The taste was amazing, the bacon is the best part from the Burger and cajuan fries!  Free refills and complimentary peanuts when your done!  Totally old school,  love it!!"}
{"text":"I have always loved five guys but this location really impressed me the other night. We weren't sure what time they closed and knew we would be cutting it close when we went. We got there and opened the door and saw they closed at 10 then we were disappointed and went on to find some place else to eat when someone who worked there, I'm  guessing some kind of manager, came out and told us to come on it and that they were still open. It was so nice and refreshing since most places scoff and give you attitude if you come in anywhere close to closing time. He welcomed us inside with such a great attitude and saved the day since that was what we were really craving. I wish I would've gotten his name so I could give him a shout out."}
{"text":"FIve Guys is ok. I don't dislike it, but I'm not as crazy for it as everyone else seems to be.
The price is the problem, and so is the portion control.
When ordering, go with a little cheeseburger and small fry. You will still be paying around 10$. Add a small drink... 12$.
The fries (cajun) were flavourful, but over salted, soggy, and warm. Think Swiss Chalet style of fries. Nothing special.
The restaurant was clean, and staff was friendly.
The Burger: The bun is excellent. The Condiments are amazing. The meat... fried, overcooked, and bland. It is juicy, which means its greasy, because they fried it, and it low grade (fatty). Again, not worth the price.
Drinks: Great selection of flavours.
Overall: Don't believe the hype, Five Guys is just alright."}
{"text":"I don't understand why everyone says the prices are way to expensive. To feed my two year old, my husband, my mother in law, a friend, and my self we spent like $36.00. My son and mother in law were the only two that got a little burger and we got two large fries, one caijon style one plain, plus a small drink for everyone. I absolutely hate salt on my fries and I thought they were perfectly seasoned.  Plus they are fried in peanut oil which is much better tasting and for you than what you would get at say, McDonalds. It is always packed so it is hard to find seating and sometimes it can be hard to place an order with how busy it is. All toppings are free, you can add bacon, mushrooms, grilled onions, jalapenos, or whatever else you want free of charge, which is why the initial cost of the burger is slightly higher than most places. I love it!"}
{"text":"Food as fresh as it can be and made to order.  
Tough clearly some high school/ college guys working here they weren't disgruntled, rude, or otherwise off putting. They were actually quite polite, seemed happy to be doing their job, and answered my questions without being annoyed :) always an A+ for me !!

The burger was good.  My gramma complained about the fries, but what's new.  They weren't 'crispy' enough for her.  The fries are thick, boardwalk style fries, which I thought were fine."}
{"text":"I was craving the infamous Cajun fries from Five Guys so I ordered a large. I had gotten a brand new debit card and I've noticed at registers that don't take chip, my card sometimes doesn't work when it's swiped which happened in this situation. I was pretty frustrated since I had just gotten my wallet stolen a week before and only had that one debit card on me while I waited for my other cards to mail in. They could have easily just turned me away but instead the general manager paid for my meal without hesitation. I believe his name was Newman but I didn't hear him that well. Such a sweet gesture and so very much appreciated. And as expected, the Fries were delicious! Thank you for the amazing customer service Five Guys!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place a few times a year, ever since it has opened. I overall recommend any burger enthusiast to at least give it a try. 
The place itself has a lot of seating space and space to wait in line so you will not feel cramped or crowded waiting in line. Five guys offer's free refills for fountain drinks, like most franchise burger joints. Another plus, like all five guys, is that they offer complimentary peanuts to snack on with your meal, a bit of a novelty as they cook with peanut oil.
The burger itself has a relatively thin compressed patty that has a decent amount of flavour, most of the moistness and flavour from the burger comes from the cheese. The taste of the patty is overall average. The burger's toppings however, are very neatly place on your bun, this is a huge benefit compared to places like burger king where it is slapped together without care. 
As for price, it is quite expensive when you order burger, fries and a drink, as this place does not offer combos. I recommend ordering 1 fries for your party your eating with, as they give you a ton of fries in the brown bag when ordered, and often through in extra fries in the bag, (keeps the customers satisfied i guess)
Overall i think this is a great place to try out if your a burger lover, but don't be blown away by any means, the burgers are simply consistent, well tasting american-style burgers, nothing mind blowing. The prices are quite steep, and comparable to burger priest which offers a lot better tasting burger, for those reasons i only give three stars."}
{"text":"So much has been written here about Five Guys Burgers that I feel almost at a loss for words to describe them. What can I say that haven't already been said?

 Excellent Burger, made precisely the way that you want it. Obvious Fresh ingredients. A large selection of toppings are available to choose from.

French Fries: Great in quantity and quality. Fresh cut, and perfectly cooked. Browned, but not excessively crunchy. Thanks so much to management for providing malt vinegar with the condiments. Makes their French fries perfect!

Soft Drinks: this Five Guys location has two of the Coca Cola Freestyle soda dispensers available. With the huge selection of flavors these drink dispensers makes available, everyone can find their favorite easily.

And as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. Yes,  our lunch was very good. But at nearly $25 for two hamburgers, a medium fry, and two drinks may be to the point of soon pricing themselves out of the market."}
{"text":"Their cheeseburgers have good flavor, as do their fries. Compared to other Five Guys restaurants I've been to, however, the flavor and experience just doesn't add up."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great burger and fries joint then you have stumbled across the right place. Wow I can not explain on how great this place is. From there customer service to there food.

We showed up just after the dinner rush and the place was a little slow but the atmosphere was awesome. We were greeted when we walked in the door by a nice lady who told us to help our self's to as much peanuts as you want!! Wait what peanuts you say yeah they have buckets of fresh peanuts along the line to get your food. All you can eat!!!

As I made my way to the order area I was ready to just order by number but found out that is not the way here. They have a card on the front counter with a laundry list of items you can add on burger at no extra cost. Pick the type of burger you want and what you want on it. Being a little in shock and new to there ways the guy helped me thought the ordering process with a smile and was extremely helpful. I mean when do you go to a \"fast food\" place and they put what ever you want on your food! This is the true meaning to have it your way!

My burger and fries were made fresh after I order it and was pretty fast too! They gave me a huge bag of fries that I couldn't even finish and that means a lot coming from me!! The burger was amazing it had that good ol home cooking flavor!

The price was high for the meal but after eating it I felt that is was justified! I wish they were a little more competitive on the cost so I don't feel bad for spending 13 bucks on 1 meal!! 

You can't beat the service and food here. Best burger joint in Vegas! (as of now)"}
{"text":"Five guys makes the best burgers I have ever had in my life, period."}
{"text":"WAY overrated...13 dollars for a burger fries and drink. The fries were terrible, but the burger was good, average at best. Honestly a double double from in and out tops it. I waited 15 minutes for my order, with only 2 people ahead of me. The drink dispenser is electronic...fun, not.
Overall, it sucked.  Give it 2 stars because the burger was good."}
{"text":"The employees were having fun singing and they looked like they enjoyed what they were doing. I  was trated great and service was above average I will eat here again."}
{"text":"I have heard many friends rave about Five Guys, so our family decided to give it a try one night.  Down to the nitty-gritty:

1. My son loved the peanuts.  I was happy they were available because we waited about 30 mins for our food....super sloooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwww.

2.  Burger - not so great.  Okay.  LOVED the toppings and that they were included in the price.  Burger was only so-so.  Menu needs to clarify that if you want a single, order the small burger as the larger burgers are doubles.

3.  Fries - Five Guy's fries broke my husband's heart.  They showed such promise, coming out in a nice cup,, very similar to how fries (and poutines) come out at most chip stands in his home province.....and then one bite and you just knew -they were under cooked.  We each had 1 or 2 fries and then had to declare them D.O.A.  

4.  Grilled cheese - loved that this option was available, but pretty steep cost for a bun turned inside out with a piece of american cheese.

I am giving 2 stars only because I have heard so much good about this restaurant since they came to Goodyear - but we won't be back."}
{"text":"First time here at any Five Guys location, finally a convenient location (also right next to Silver Snail for the comic book lovers).    So heres the deal I know how they flatten their burger patties so I order a regular cheeseburger vs a little cheeseburger, the difference is one beef pattie & $2 in price raised.

After consuming the regular (double pattie) cheeseburger, I can say I would be happy with a little cheeseburger.  If you got a mammoth hunger or  just the type to order a burger and drink then the regular (double pattie) will fill you up.

Back to the cheese burger, for toppings I went \"all the way\"  (see picture of menu I'm posting), and it was great.   I'm not one for tomatoes on my burger cause I think makes everything soggy, not here it works very well in this classic cheese burger -- and its more like a firm meaty tomatoe slices.

Also you get the little crustyness on the outside of the pattie from the grill and OMG the cheese just melts so amazingly well.  I just read someone raving about their grilled cheese below, definitely gonna try that next time.

I went with a friend and was going to share fries with him, firstly regular sized fries is more than enough for two people -- I hear large fries are good for 3-4 people.

Unfortunately my buddy chose cajun fries vs the regular five guys style, and I usually like cajun fries -- but here its way too salty.   At least drink refills are free, so if you're not into extremely salty fries then probably go with regular.   And don't get me wrong I eat like lays potatoe chips all the time, but the cajun fries here are too salty.

NOW HERES THE THING.... BEST CHEESE BURGER EVER .... EVEN BETTER THAN BURGER PRIEST!   I'm gonna get hate mail over this.  Heres my reasoning, I used to like Burger Priest's Cheese Burger when you could get your burger done rare --- cause it was so juicy it was amazing.  

But now you can only get it done medium at Priests now after some dumb customers complained, which is not juicy at all.   But Five Guys cheese burger is juicy and with goeey (processed only way to go) cheesy goodness.   So I declare it the best Cheese Burger for me in Toronto, done."}
{"text":"We love Five Guys but this location isn't the same. Is it a franchise maybe?
Every other Five Guys we've visited was so much better, from the taste of the burger, the bun quality and the amount of fries they throw in the bag. 
At any other Five Guys you can order 1 small fry and it will feed 2-3 people, this location it was barely enough for two people.,
We have tried a few different locations in AZ and even the one in Prescott Valley was better than this location."}
{"text":"ask them to add a shot of chocolate to the Malted milkshake, tastes much better
Little Hamburger (one patty)  is perfect at lunchtime"}
{"text":"I just read an interview with the founder of this place in Inc. Magazine - interesting story behind the business.

Great burgers!  I'm not sure how they get them well done but yet still so juicy.  The fries were ok - perhaps my expectations were too high after reading the article.  The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was due to the price - 2 burgers, 2 fries, & 2 drinks was $20.  That being said, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! My boyfriend thinks its better than In-n-out. I think the fries here are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The customer service was great! The cashier was nice and so was the guy that handed us our food. The pricing is kinda crazy....like my boyfriend said, it's kinda like we went to a bbq but instead we paid $22. When I started to eat the burger I noticed an off taste...the burger was good but there was a familiar taste/smell. After thinking and eating, I realized the burger had hot dog flavoring....that was a first for me LOL. Not to sure about going back here...prefer SmashBurger over this for the amount we paid and quality of food."}
{"text":"I really like the simple menu concept and the people at the Kent place always seem pretty fast and good. I like the burgers a lot for fast food, and theyre worth the price. Itll actually make you full. Fries are ok too. One time they forgot to make my order, but they hooked me up with a gift card and fries for the wait."}
{"text":"In my opinion, a Five Guys burger is nearly as good as an In-n-Out burger. The only real drawback of the Five Guys burger is the mediocre bun. That said, I'm happy to have a Five Guys burger at any time.

Oh, and the cajun fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"Five Guys Burgers & Fries is great!
I love the drink machine, 110 different flavors. 
The fries are ALWAYS hot, and the my burger is always made to order.
One time they couldn't process my gift card, so they gave me my meal free!"}
{"text":"Let's get this straight right now, I'm not a small guy. 

I ordered a cheeseburger, fries and a coke and could not even finish them. 

What really struck me about this place was how fresh everything was... my burger was just awesome, the fries were tasty... the coke, well was coke. heh.

I hate the decor and chairs though... decor is ugly and the chairs are so stiff."}
{"text":"Thanks for such a clean environment! !!! Everyone is so nice and the veggie burger is a must try! 's quality on the west side!"}
{"text":"Hey Five Guys, you're new bebe fry boy is terrible at making fries. I only come here for the Cajun fries and this kid made the fries so salty and gross, I threw them away. Now I'm not the type to toss food, usually I make it work. This was bad, beyond edible and super frustrating. My regular fries were like a small at McDonalds. Not cool!"}
{"text":"The outer appearance of the store is very attracting. Unlike most five guys, this one really stands out from the rest of the shops on Yonge street. This five guys the outer appearance includes bright lights and a big sign. haha

The food itself is really nothing special but it tastes like a nice classic burger. Unlike Mcdonald's burgers which has ingredients where you do not know what is in it.

Overall, 4 stars"}
{"text":"Way in the back corner of the shopping complex.  Not too crowded at 3:15 pm.  We ordered the single patty burger with almost everything, 2 burgers, fries, free peanuts and a drink cost $17.43.  Burgers were excellent, lots of fries (kinda oily), and the peanuts were very crunchy."}
{"text":"Bad, Bad and really BAD. Dry burgers.  Cheese does not taste like cheese.  Expensive, for dry burgers.

Burgers taste like precooked.  Frozen or cheap fast food burgers taste better then the burgers at this location.

On the plus side, service was good."}
{"text":"Clean and friendly.  Yummy burger.  We choose this over In n Out every time."}
{"text":"The best burger ive had out side the strip. Makes in out look like a step child. free peanuts also. fries are bomb also the way they cook onion n mushrooms were good. patty was very flavor full. wait was a breeze and serves were very polite and nice !!"}
{"text":"A great location with alright burgers nothing significant, the burger is cooked mostly unevenly , some parts are either colder, harder, chewier . Buns fall apart after a few bites. The topping list is large enough and Cajun style fries are a good addition. They play nice rock music , staff are both friendly and all over the place too, the cleanliness is decent. Overall , a good enough decent place for students to grab a burger."}
{"text":"Really tasty freshly made burgers and fries. Nice selection of toppings....great mushrooms... For the first bites, I liked better than In 'n Out. Fries are better than In 'n Out's. Great music...The Doors were blasting away.... Industrial but clean atmosphere. Friendly staff and great customer service. Glad they are in Surprise.

Issues: portions --even for the single patty burgers are too big as far as I am concerned (In n' Out's are better sized). As I finished the burger, I wasn't finding it as tasty as at the start. I think it had cooled off a bit. I had also been chowing away on piping hot fries. I think the portion sizes are used to rationalize the higher prices.

As I see it, portion sizes (of tasty food) like Five Guys are contributing to America's obesity epidemic. I will return...not as often as I would if the portions were better sized. --I will likely eat more at In 'n Out per serving size."}
{"text":"The name says it all, \"burgers and fries.\" They do also have hot dogs and a few other things, but burgers and fries is their specialty. This is definitely not a place for anyone with a peanut allergy to go. As a vegetarian, I like that I can get a bun with enough veggies and cheese on it to be filling. That being said their sandwiches are extremely sloppy and their fries are quite oily, but very good. Both their regular fries and Cajun fries are good and they are very generous with their portions. If you are looking for fast food that is tasty, and fresh I recommend Five Guys."}
{"text":"Great burgers, nice staff and malt vinegar for the fries. Not the greatest burgers I have ever had, but convenient and I get burgers here more than any other place."}
{"text":"Gave them a second try and I won't be back. 

$13.00 for a small burger and fries!
Burger was mediocre, fries, I've had much better.

Service was good and reasonably fast. They were not busy at all."}
{"text":"Freakin OUTSTANDING!!!
Perfect burger 
I used to be a devoted Fatburger kinda guy
Im a convert
I'd walk a mile for one of these badboys - in the rain
Very clean restaurant too - I like that"}
{"text":"Very good experience at this Five Guys. The food was good as always and the restaurant was clean. I would always recommend FG to anyone from the east coast who is raving about white castle. 

Ine thing about Five Guys is that the staff is always friendly and even though it takes a lottle time to receive your food, you can always rest assured that the food is hot and fresh!

I am glad that FG is close by our work office, it makes for a nice weekday \"cheat\" meal when you just have to have a juicy burger and fries. I also love that the drink machine is one of the multi machines with so many options and choices."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times now, and when we feel like taking the drive down here, we prefer it to In-N-Out most times. The only thing they don't have that we miss is chocolate shakes. I would love to dunk the fries here into a chocolate shake. 

They offer a \"veggie burger\" that is basically all of their condiments on a bun. You can add cheese if you like as well. I think its pretty good and its a nice break from the basic veggie patties you see at most places. They have the best fries here. We like the cajun style the best, and the regular size is plenty for two people. They basically fill up one cup full of fries and put it in the bag, and then dump another full cup in the bag. So you are getting two cups of fries. We never finish them. They are made to order so they are always piping hot. Friendly staff and you can munch on some peanuts before your food comes out. 

For two veggie burgers, fries, and two drinks we can get out of here at less than $15. Regular burgers and hot dogs end up costing more so if you are an omnivore it could get a little pricy. But for us vegetarians its a darn good deal."}
{"text":"I could not believe my ears! Almost 55.00 for my family of 5 to get burgers, 2 orders of fries and drinks. I felt like leaving but my whole family was hungry and standing there. Food was ok nothing special by any means.  We threw most of the fries away as not very good.  The place was so loud with the music so loud you couldnt have a conversation so we were forced to eat outside in 100 degree weather.
Next time in and out!! Never again."}
{"text":"Good burgers that taste fresh but way too pricy for a burger joint. Better off grilling up some burgers at home if you need a customer burger that bad. 

Best part is how much fries they give you, def enough to go around if you don't mind sharing.

This location is as good as any for speed of service and consistency of food. Pretty good overall"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers for a \"fast food\" place. Best fries! Quite the stereo system!"}
{"text":"I am thrilled to finally have a five guys only minutes away from home. This was only the third time I have ever been to a five guys. 

My experience at this new location was great, the food was as good as I remembered it to be. The employees were super friendly and the place was clean as clean could be.

I will definitely be frequent customer at this fine fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"I gave this two starts on the strength of the fries ONLY.  Fresh cut, fresh cooked, and plenty of 'em.  Nice.

Burger?  Not so much.  In fact, not one little bit.  I think what lost me was the cheese.  Tasted like a melted Wham-O Superball.  Totally, totally fake pasteurized process cheese food.  Blech.

Also, the burger seemed to be completely unseasoned.  Needs... something.  Worcestershire?  Tabasco?  Garlic?  All Three?  And REAL cheese pleeez.

Also, Regular burger, fries, coke = $11.  WHAT!  The Miller High Life Delivery Guy won't be loving them either!"}
{"text":"Went here with my family got two kids hot dogs two hamburgers anda fry to share spent over $40. that's ridiculous I could have gone to a nice sit-down sushi restaurant with my family and paid the same price if not less. My kids are 3 and 1 years old so they dont get much for a burger place I wouldn't expect to pay over $25-30. The bun on the burger was stale almost crumbling apart will not go back"}
{"text":"Tonight we decided to try this place. Walked in and I could smell how happy my stomach was gonna be happy. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and grilled mushrooms with cajun fries. My fianc√© had the bacon cheeseburger with all the toppings.
We sat down and watched them cook the burgers and I felt like I was in a scene from the movie Good Burger inside of Mondo Burger. Those burgers are huge and tasty. The fries were amazing. Just know that the Cajun fries have a little kick to it.
Can't imagine why we haven't been here. But we will be back!"}
{"text":"Well....if you're dying for a burger, I guess.  I'm not  usually dying for a burger.  I just wanted to try something new.  This one does come with the option of grilled onions along with other toppings, so that does make it better than fast food, just not that much better.  The fries rock.
 
Something I just don't get about this place is the volume of the music.  Maybe they're trying to drowned out the sound of the kitchen, but it feels like the speakers are screaming the music down on me.  This is just another place where conversations are like a yelling competition with the other patrons and the music.  

I added one extra star in my rating because of the Coke machine.  This thing is awesome.  It looks like a spaceship and has about 100 different combinations of drinks."}
{"text":"My wife and I have fallen in love with 5 Guys burgers. And this location is a great one!
They are real pros and a friendly team! 
yeah, it's pricey. But if you go somewhere else, you think you've overpaid because the quality is so sub-par compared to 5 Guys. Goodbye BK, McD's, Wendy's, etc etc etc.!"}
{"text":"My favorite Charlotte spot to grab a cheeseburger (and fries)! 

I usual grab Five Guys on a Sunday night. After a long weekend, I'm ready for something quick and delicious. I usually call ahead and they take a minute or two to get my fries ready when I arrive but no complaints because I love hot and fresh fries! 

My \"go to\" is a cheese burger (regular sized) with lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mayo and grilled onions. 

And they have malt vinegar is you like that on your fries."}
{"text":"Wow.... first time here and I'm definitely coming back. I love how I put a lot of toppings on my burger and it did not fall apart. My bacon hamburger was juicy and cooked perfectly. The bun was so soft and not over sized. I love the fresh fries which came with a combo of long n soft and short n crispy. ...I like that. It was all so delicious I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"They have a great product but $7 for a hambuger, $3 for fries and $2.50 for a drink makes a very expensive lunch of nearly $14.  I will not come back as often any more.  Seems like they keep raising prices to where they are too high!!!"}
{"text":"Placed an order online and was told that my pickup time was in 10 minutes. Got there on time and was given my drink cup and receipt. Filled up my drink and took a seat until my food was ready. Two people came in after me, ordered their food and were on their way before I even got my food. After 20 minutes of just waiting I finally said something to them and they told me that they didn't know I was there. Ummm you gave me my receipt and drink, YOU KNEW I WAS THERE. Finally they dropped my fries, but I still had to wait 10 more minutes to receive my food and by that time our burgers were already cold. Was not offered any sort of compensation or apology. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at this restaurant before, but to go in here and get the food that I got and pay $34 plus I'm absolutely appalled. It was the worst hamburger I've ever had in my life my son and I didn't even eat and we actually threw them away along with their gross fries. Just praying we don't  gets sick from the nasty food."}
{"text":"Please be more careful about listening to special orders. My husband went to great lengths to order me a burger that's safe for my food allergies, only for me to open it and find it's covered in cheese. It's in the garbage now, so thanks for that."}
{"text":"Its very nyc to eat here . The fries d awesum n d burgers also yummy. D the salted peanuts are Gr8 to munch over till d odr cums ....they r freeeee"}
{"text":"Their burgers are pretty good and their fries are great and hot dogs as well. The staff even better but the only thing stopping me from going everyday is the price. 2 burgers and an order of fries can reach 28 bucks like someone said. Its ok once in a while but more than that would put you in poor house"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Five Guys, so of course we had to try it.  We went with some friends that like it.  My wife is an In-n-Out fan, but for the record I wouldn't say I LOVE In-n-Out, but it's okay.  They are more hype than food to me, honestly.  Use that as your comparison to what I say here.

On to Five Guys...

Their investment in marketing is brilliant: 1 font, 2 colors: red/white.  This is a no frills place.  Don't expect to see a lot of flare here.  Red/White is all you get.  Their menu is easy.  Burger, Cheeseburger, Bacon Burger, Hot Dog (other stuff for kids).  All toppings are free.  So if you wanted a green-chile-bacon-bbq burger with onions and relish...you can get it at the same price as a bacon burger.  

If there is a line and you don't know what you want, do us all a favor and step out of line.  This is a fast paced place and process orders pretty quick, so move along okay!

I got a burger and hot dog.  Hey you have to try both right?  I'll start with the dog.  Now any of you that put ketchup on your hot dog, stop reading and buy a flight to New York...you'll notice that is not allowed.  Dogs are onion/relish/mustard.  Done.  Five Guys splits their dogs down the center for faster cooking -- I LOVE this idea and already incorporated it in my own dog cooking for the kids.  The dog was a dog...good, and exactly what I expected -- was it the BEST?  No.  But it was what it advertised.

The burger -- my first attempt was onion, hot sauce.  It wasn't that great.  My ONLY complaint about these burgers is the meat itself needs more flavor.  Put some salt on those bad boys would you.  Knowing that though, understand that your burger will essentially taste like what you put on it.  If you want a plain burger, I'm positive you'll be disappointed.  My second try (not the same visit, c'mon I'm not that bad...well maybe, but not this time) I went for bacon burger with BBQ sauce and onion (note: I don't like cheese).  It was much better than my first experience.  Still wish the meat was seasoned.

Fries -- disappointing to me on first visit.  I saw \"cajun fries\" and said yum.  It's not really...it's regular fries with some sprinkle seasons.  They can do better here.  And based on the acclaimations that hang all over the place they have to some people.  I need to give the fries a second chance.  They are skin on fries though and perhaps cut to thick for my taste is what the problem is.  I like crispy fries,not soggy.  If I wanted a baked potato, I would have got one, so give me FRIES.

So why the 4 star rating?  Well if Yelp would allow half stars it'd be 3.5.  For me though, I liked this place better than In-n-Out.  If I want a better-than-fast-food burger that I can see being made and get it made-to-order, I think this will be my place.

If you want to try the dog/burger -- get the SMALL burger with your dog -- it's big enough. Trust me.

No shakes at this place though...straight up normal soda fountain.

My son had the grilled cheese (or 'girl cheese' as he calls it) and loved it.  They flip a burger bun inside out...clever."}
{"text":"So Five Guys is finally here in Canada at the tail end of T.O.'s burger craze. My advice is to park your expectations of what a T.O. burger should be at the door because the only thing they serve here is an all-American burger.

You don't get to pick your cheese from a silly selection of 10 different cheeses. They only have American cheese (ie. processed yellow cheese). The bun is a white bread, sesame burger bun. There are no ciabattas or whole wheat buns to be found here. Your choice of veggies stop at lettuce and tomatoes. There is no arugala or portabello on this menu. And you can forget about getting to pick your choice of lamb, chicken, or Kobe beef. It's 100% ground beef only here!

Five Guys only serves a proper artery clogging, all-American burger and makes no apologies for it. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and it was everything you would expect from a burger conceived in the USA. The burger is thick and heavy, the cheese is processed in two layers of bright yellow goop, the bread is a soggy mess, and the bacon is piled high and greasy. And their small fries is ridiculous. I couldn't even find my burger under all the fries in the paper bag they gave me! If your name is Fat Albert you might call it a small order, but for the rest of us mortals, we call it a shovelful.

The great thing about Five Guys is that they don't charge you $1-$2 for each topping, like most T.O. gourmet burger joints. All of their toppings are free and applied liberally. When I got my burger, it was a mess because of all the stuff they tried to cram in there, but it was oh so good! I think the next time I come back I'll just have the burger with mustard and ketchup because the rest of the burger's elements can hold up on their own. This beast is a sinful heart attack inducing mess and you gotta try it!

One word of advice for those with peanut allergies though... everything is cooked in peanut oil here so don't come here!"}
{"text":"Definitely get the small burger if you don't want a huge 2 patty burger!  Large fries are enough for 2 or more people and the burgers are pretty good.  Kind of like the ones hot off your grill at home.  Kind of pricey so if you aren't prepared for $20+ for 2 persons then stick with I/O or Freddy's but overall really good.  This place was loud and I even asked to have it turned down and they happily obliged."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of 5 guys and was excited when a location was opening up near my home.  I'm glad 5 guys has been making their way out west and in the Phoenix area, first in Mesa and Tempe and now in South Phoenix.. I was familiar with them during my trips back to the DC area and always had to \have one when I was there..

Things I enjoy about 5 guys, the simple menu choices, the topping choices, the free peanuts while you wait for your food and the meat is fresh.  You get a very tasty and high quality burger with the toppings you like. 

You also get a ton of fries, even on the small order. A small fry should feed a two people no problem

If you order a cheeseburger, fries and a soda, you are looking at about $11.

This location is always packed! I've been here 3 times since the placed opened at various times and days of the week and there is always a ton of people here. Even with the location, crowded, your food is ready in about 10 minutes.

I just wish the price was a bit cheaper, but worth a treat every so often."}
{"text":"My 5 guys experience was always on the East Coast (Maryland). I was excited that a location was coming just a few miles from me. I really enjoy the burgers and fries. I've held off long enough, but the time had finally to come to enjoy the 5 guys burger once again.

I'm very shocked with all the sour reviews low scores. I think folks in AZ and out west are still getting to know 5 guys and haven't fully appreciated the goodness. 

Locally, I would only take a Lobby's burger over 5 guys. In/Out is close. Each their own.....

5 guys is still a great burger. I will admit the burger was a bit below the taste that I had in Maryland. I think it may have been the bun.

The fries tasted just the same, which I really enjoy. The fries are cut there and fresh. A regular fries can easily feed 2 people. Don't go for the larger size, you'll regret the cost and having so many extra fries.

I enjoy the simple menu and you get to decide what toppings you want on your burger. There are several options to choose from.  

The free peanuts is a nice touch to snack on before your meal is ready..I always enjoy a handful.

With this location, the biggest issues were the floors were dirty and the music being played was VERY loud. I'm at a place to eat, not a rock show or club.

My wife was super excited there was caffeine free diet coke in the fountain."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Five Guys in a while - SouthPark Mall when they first opened. Didn't care for it then, but thought I'd give them another try at the Arboretum. Now I know why they call it Five Guys....apparently it takes Five guys to cook your burger, and Five hours to get it to you! It was a Sat. afternoon and not that crowded, no line when I walked in, and yet it still took a good 15 minutes before they brought it to me. And the price? C'mon, a simple bacon cheeseburger, fries and a fountain drink should not cost $16 and change. While you can't compare their burgers to McDonald's, at least Mickey Dees gets it to you way faster and for one-third the price. On the plus side, they do give you plenty of fries (burnt ones, too) in a paper cup, with the extras dumped in a greasy paper bag. And although the roasted peanuts in a shell are free, it does not justify what I paid that day. Sorry, Five Guys, it will be at least Five years before you see my smiling face again."}
{"text":"Really good food. It's just like in and out but it tastes more homemade, if that makes sense. They also have one of those new coke machines that has tons of flavors and syrups.

Fries are thick cut which isn't quite my style but they were good. Overall, I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"This is what a burger should taste like. I was satisfied and there wasn't any stupid gourmet type additives or toppings that shouldn't be on an all-American burger in the first place. As my first visit to this restaurant chain, I can say I will be back again definitely.  The only thing I have to thumbs down on was the Cajun fries....waaay too salty. I had to toss them out even after I tried wiping off some of the salty red spice with  bunch of napkins.  There was no saving them.  Maybe I just got a fluke bad batch and the seasoning guy had heavy hands, but it was not edible.  As for the burgers, top notch deelish!"}
{"text":"Five guys has one of the most delicious burger in the USA . I tried it in Philadelphia and I like it. I used to eat it twice a week ,but here in Tempe I don't like the service because sometimes they don't clean the table and they work slowly."}
{"text":"The burger was fine but the bun was really really soggy. It ruined the burger. If they can figure out a way to keep the bun fresh it would be great."}
{"text":"I just don't get this place....what do peanuts have to do with burgers and fries?  Besides the odd addition of peanuts, the menu is very basic like an In and Out Burger....but about 3 times the price!

The menu doesn't say anywhere that the regular burger has 2 patties....which would be helpful when ordering for someone that isn't trying to practice for a food eating competition!  The burgers tasted good, but they weren't anything special that I would go back for.  Besides, two burgers and a side of fries was $20...there are much better burgers out there with comparable prices."}
{"text":"Definitely the best fast food burger place in Vegas. Everyone likes to compare it to In-N-Out but i believe there is no comparison. Five Guys' meat has a better quality taste, and the size of the burgers are ridiculous, so the price is definitely worth it. I'll take quality over quantity anyday. The cajun fries are also amazing. It's my favorite place to go to for sure."}
{"text":"First time ever in my life in a 5 guys. 

Burger was good.  Some where between McDonald's and Wendy's.  Only difference was the price!  Good lord!!!!  

Granted I generally eat more local so it was good for me to experience this chain resturant.  

Nah...won't be back.  I'll stick with one of the other local burger joints that has character and quality that warrants the price tag.

Went ahead and gave them 2 stars for the free nuts!"}
{"text":"My Hubby & I came here for lunch this past Saturday & we thought it was pretty damn good. 

I got the little bacon cheeseburger & Hubs got the bacon cheeseburger (2 patties of beef). We are 1 in the same & got the same toppings: lettuce, pickles & mustard. Oh & he opted for the grilled onions which I wish I had done, too. We each got a regular order of fries as well. We should of just shared an order, more than half of the bag was filled with fries! Can't even imagine how big the large order is. 

We thought it was cool that they have peanuts & that you can just toss the shells on the ground, something different. For our burgers, fries & drinks it was about $22 & some change, not too bad.

We will definitely come back for lunch, but not anytime soon since these kinds of places you should only eat at once in a while. We'll see if we like it as much the 2nd time around. We get easily burnt out on places like this: i.e. Culver's & In N Out."}
{"text":"I usually just eat chicken burgers, but this is the only place where I'll eat a beef burger. They're a bit pricey, but extremely delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is my all time favorite place to get a burger and fries. The burgers taste fresh and homemade. And the tried are awesome. Especially with the Cajun seasoning. The people working here are always nice and you get free all you can eat peanuts."}
{"text":"Yea...I've been waiting for 11 years for a take-out burger joint close to home and finally, it's here! Everything in Vegas/Henderson is either fast food chain crap or you have to go to one of those bar and grill places where you still get to inhale smoke (don't get me wrong, my dad smokes and I don't mind, but I don't want to be around it while I'm eating). I was looking for a place where I could just run in, order and take it home and eat it while it's still hot...this is it. 

The burger's are good. You can get the small, which is a perfect size for me and you can order any toppings you want...free of charge. The fries are good, but can be a little fresher. It's so crowded, so they make a lot to keep enough on hand so if they sit too long, they get a little too greasy and squishy. Don't forget your free peanuts if you're a fan of peanuts.

Even though it's crowded and you can't get a table, getting through the line and out is fast, so don't let that scare you off...if you can get a parking spot that is. Oh, and the service has been very good every time I've been there...very friendly. Hope it stays that way."}
{"text":"Freshly prepared burgers just the way you want it. Nice fresh cut french fries with some of the potato skin for flavor. Definitely go there with an appetite. More expensive than In n Out burger but worth it. Only down side is having to deal with parking on Mill."}
{"text":"Always great food at a very reasonable price. Would like to see more sides offered but other than that no complaints.  Also staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Very pricey burger joint! Go to T-bones instead. Burger was tasty, however for $12.49 for burger and Cajun fries (no drink) paid way too much!!!!!! May not last long."}
{"text":"First off let me explain, I love burgers. A good burger will keep me coming back over and over and over. I think it is more than just the meat or the size that makes the burger, I think half of it is the bun and the shape of the burger. With five guys you get a  very high priced burger that is very small but thick. And by high priced I mean this is a fast food burger joint where you get it at the counter and for a burger that did not fill me up with fries and a drink it costed me $15. That is without bacon or any extras. The burger has the circumference of an in n out burger for triple the price. The burger bun is skinny, cheap, and soggy. Would much rather eat at carls jr or whataburger getting more meat and higher quality bun for much less. Even if they cut their prices in half I still would not come back. The fries are soggy and tastless. They try to make up their bad flavor by shoving them in a messy bag and giving you a ton. I would rather have half the amount of fries done well. The only reason why I give them 2 and not one star is because the food tastes like real meat and potatoes and they have a really cool soda machine. I was actually going to order another burger just to fill myself up as I didnt feel like getting full on fries and then I thought it would be just ridiculous if I were to spend 25+ dollars at a fast food burger place for just myself. Also what kind of burger joint doesnt offer SHAKES!"}
{"text":"Service is always great and the burgers are a handful. Love the complimentary peanuts and generous fry portions too. Eat here way more often than I should, but that's just a testament to how good it is!"}
{"text":"I got a bacon cheeseburger and fries. I got it to go. The food was so greasy it soaked the bag that it came in. When I finally ate the burger it was super greasy too. Every bite I could smell the grease. It was almost like the cooked everything in dirty grease pit. The young lady was super nice that took my order. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"These burgers are always awesome!  Location is everything you would expect from a 5 Guys.  I've not yet been to one that fell short.  Totally recommend... Consistently great."}
{"text":"I usually don't like fries, but five guys fries are good!!! The burger is definitely better than Steak -n- shake, and about the same with In-n-out. The kicker is the extra toppings with grilled onions and mushroom and peppers. Bad news is the price about $9 for a cheeseburger (double meat & cheese) and regular fries no drink. I came in around 3:30 pm so there was no line. Nice and courteous staff. They asked me if I wanted more fries."}
{"text":"It is a good burger, but with Five Guys I am a rare species against these guys. I have taken down a 5 patty, yes a 5 stack here pretty easily. For some reason, this joint NEVER fills me up. I can also tell you I ate Taco Bell after I had a double cheeseburger with fries, because I think it's just another cheeseburger in my belly. I literally will vouch any day of the week until I die that In N Out on the west coast is 10 times better than five guys. However, I won't knock on their burger it tastes pretty good. The only way I will go here is if a buddy is really feeling it and I am up in the mood for a cheeseburger. I will never go out on a limb and suggest it though, just because it NEVER fills me up. - MC"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequently come here while we lived in the area. We love this place! The quality of the food and the service is awesome!  I don't mind the price, I rather spend the money on fresh REAL food than throwing my money away to a sub par establishment. The staff is so awesome! We will miss this place! Keep up the good work everyone!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I ate a burger from Burger King and paid 7$+ dollars and after that point I made a promise to myself... I will never eat a cheeseburger from a fast food establishment ever again. I mean I can just come to five guys instead. Delicious, fast, high quality product. However, if you're not a complete idiot you may already know that Five guys is better than fast food. So for the reason I'm writing this is because I had an incredible experience with an employee. I think her name was Cathay or Kate. She was a host and took my order. She was extremely friendly, kind, and helpful. After my order was complete she checked back in on me and even refilled my water for me. Her hard work, kind personality, and her  going out of her way to make others happy should be acknowledged."}
{"text":"Only Five Guys location I will go to. Hands down the best burgers and the most accommodating and professional manager I've ever seen! He's done nothing but provide excellent customer service and definitely makes the kids feel more than welcome !! Great atmosphere and the boyfriend loves the food as well !!"}
{"text":"Walking by this place everyday, combined with hype from my American friends, I really expected a lot from Five Guys. Some of that hype was undeserved, but a lot of it was spot on. The portion for their fries (smallest being a regular) can feed 2-3 easily, especially if everyone gets a burger. The burger was good but I kind of expected something more. But this is a place I'd still come to, probably with a group of friends, though."}
{"text":"Best example of customer service in a food establishment I've been to. The cooks asked what I was getting before I got to the cashier so they could start prepping my order, cashier was friendly and appreciative, everyone behind the counter thanked me for the business on the way out. Great hiring and training Five Guys!"}
{"text":"I know this is a chain, so the different restaurants may vary in quality, but I've always had good experiences at this location. To me, Five Guys is the best hamburger when I'm in the mood for one. The meat tastes fresh and has a great flavor. The bun is soft and warm. I also like that they have unlimited toppings, so you can come up with whatever combination you like and not be charged extra for things. The fries are addicting! They are nice and crispy, but they aren't thin like those shoestring fries. They have a satisfying size and shape to them. What more is there to say? If you're looking for a hamburger and fries, then go here!"}
{"text":"Ross and I moved to Arizona from Arlington, VA. We use to walk to the original Five Guy's burger stand. So, you can imagine our excitement and concern to see Five Guy's become a \"chain\" and start popping up all over the valley. Frankly, I was worried that quality would suffer. 

Five Guys is still exactly how I remember the experience: Long lines, simple burgers, and tons of french fries. It's a great treat and, in my opinion, surpasses In and Out Burgers.

Some tips for visiting: 
1. Unless you are a big man or extremely hungry, stick with the \"Little Burger\" (one patty). 
2. ONE small order of Fries should be enough for a table of four. They give you a serving and then they dump an additional serving into the paper bag. 
3. Don't visit during lunch hour during the week (anywhere between 11:30 and 1:30) -- the line and wait for a simple burger is outrageous. 

We love Five Guy's -- mostly for nostalgia, but also because of the freshness and taste of the burger!!! I think your own experience and opinion will vary depending on how long you have to wait ...it IS after all only a burger."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a burger and fries.  However, a bit on the expensive side.  I have never had any complaints.  They always make our food quickly and done right.  The kids that work here are great, fun, and nice.  They provide exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"It is 12/4/16, and as promised I had never been back at this place. Every time I am at the Fashion Square  Mall in Scottsdale where this place is located, I eat somewhere else.  

Awful service, rude and defiant attitude lady.   I was there on Sunday 04/26/2015, around 1-2 p.m. I ordered a little bacon hamburger. Since there were four people in front of me and I had my dogs waiting for me in the patio. I went to the patio to wait for my order. When I saw that the people in front of me had been given their meal, there are glass windows,  I went  in and the lady was holding a bag while yelling number 69. I had not my receipt on me and asked her, Is it the little hamburger with bacon? She looked at me then at the ticket on the paper bag and kept yelling number 69. There was nobody waiting for another order. I went back to the patio, grabbed the receipt, and yes I was order 69. When I came back in I went to the lady and told her I am 69. She plained ignored me. Then I went to another guy and he gave it to me. I asked for a cup for water (for my dogs) and the guy said in a nice way, you can get it from the counter top. So I went to the counter top and grabbed a cup, only to be yelled by  the lady, \" Those are not the cups for water.\" I asked, where are the cups for water? And she said in a nasty tone, I will give it to you. She grabbed a cup and stood in a defiant attitude in front of me for about 10 seconds before she gave it to me. Moving the cup in a teasing way. She kept looking at my eyes in a defiant mode. I completely avoided her. When I grabbed the cup, from her hand wile she was playing with it so I could not grabbed it, and turned around to walk to the patio she exclaimed out loud WOW! 

Based on previous reviews I can see that it seems this is the work attitude at this location. I do not know her name but you can not miss her. She is the oldest of all. She  is  not a teenager. She must  be in her 40¬¥s and she wears  reading glasses. Shame on you lady. I was there just to eat my lunch. And I was treated like if I was begin for food.  I truly hope you get fired. Also, do you realized that not giving water is illegal in Arizona? Playing with the cup and puling it away from me seemed like you did not want me to have water. Shame on the owner of this location that allows his employees to treat customers this way. 

I will never go back to this location. The hamburgers are good.  But bad service can make your lunch a bad experience .  I am paying and I expect at least some courtesy. I am not there to put up with a person with issues. If I am going to leave my money even if it only $10 dollars, I will leave it in a business that employees  are kind to people. 

This person should not be allowed to be in contact with the public. This kind of attitude will ruin any business."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is their portions. You definitely get your money's worth from here. But the down-side of it (in my opinion)....It's just a decent burger. Not terrible in anyway, not great in anyway."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries i have ever had. This location has the best friendly customer service. Defentily worth the money. Will continue to come."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the Bacon Cheeseburger.... Fantastic!!!! Great burger and fantastic fries! Thank guys!"}
{"text":"Good service and amazing shakes. We don't eat out often so when we do we are very picky. This is a place I would come to again."}
{"text":"Every time I eat a burger from here its like a party in my mouth and every delicious flavor is invited. They have ruined me as now I can no longer eat a burger from anywhere else. I love 5 Guys Burger and fries so much."}
{"text":"Do Not Go To the Fashion Square Mall 5 Guys. At 4:30 pm (not the lunch rush) last Saturday the guy taking our order could have cared less that we were standing there.  It was our first time at 5 guys and we were perusing the menu and asking him for help.  You would have thought a robot was talking to you.

After we got our greasy bag of fries and beverages we had to search high and low for a clean table to sit at.  Not only were the tops of the tables filthy but there was food and garbage underneath them.  After eating greasy fries we looked at the two garbage receptacles and they were overflowing. Absolutely overflowing.  I went back to the counter and told the robot that the place was filthy and we couldn't get our garbage in the cans.

He says \"Thanks.  Have a Nice Day\"  What a joke this place is.  Won't go to any Five Guys again ever."}
{"text":"Always good. Juicy yummy bacon cheeseburgers, love the grilled jalapenos. Fries are perfect! Great service too. 5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"Consider yourself warned, fellow Yelpers. This is simply as good as a burger gets in this life. This place was opened by a few people in DC and now its spreading life wild-fire across the entire country. There is one reason: *it is the best hamburger joint in the world.*

Though I'm a fifth generation Californian, I did have the opportunity to live in Washington, DC for a time. This is the type of place my co-workers, family and friends would regularly travel to when it meant a 45 minute drive through traffic. The way they cook their burgers and those boardwalk fries... pure heaven. This place blows other fast food joints out of the water, to the point where it's not even worth comparing. You really have to look at a place like Delux or Fez to find a burger comparable here in the Valley, and even they can't do it as well as Five Guys, a pure piece of Americana. Take advantage of it and go eat at it ASAP. I'm glad they brought this to Arizona and you certainly will be too upon trying it."}
{"text":"The food is good, however last year I bit into a small piece of bone in my hamburger, chipped a tooth and needed a root canal. I thought it was just a fluke. Today, I had dinner there and again bit into two small pieces of bone. I can't eat here anymore."}
{"text":"Love the food, only complaint is the cashiers have been very rude when we pay and they are my husband's military id and ask rudely tell him he should've told them. But it's not a huge deal, I go there for the food not the people."}
{"text":"Wow, 34.00 dollars for 2 cheeseburgers, fries one drink and one shake. I feel like a fool for spending  that much money for a mediocre burger. The onions are chopped, along with the lettuce, bulk garbage from a bag...they don't even bother to hand leaf the lettuce, or slice onions. Grill man has a thick wirey black goatee and no beard guard...guaranteed hair in food. Frys were cooked twice, overcooked and soggy. Massive dissapointment."}
{"text":"Burgers are so good but they gotts be bigger! Nice selection of toppings but i think they should do chicken burgers as well. The complimentary peanuts are a nixe touch and ive never had complaints about the staff."}
{"text":"I love cheeseburgers, but the cheeseburgers here are very disappointing.  I tried this place twice and each time I was very disappointed.  I will stay with Harveys!!!"}
{"text":"$ Power to the People $ Not sure the downtown Phoenix Five Guys has ever been this busy for this long on a Saturday #OccupyPhoenix http://twitpic.com/70uw9q"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Five Guys. Great burgers, good fries. Service is very quick. Best burger place in town!"}
{"text":"This is the best fast food I've ever been.. We don't have this in Europe, trust me !
The fries are excellent, and the bacon cheeseburger.. man that's amazing.
JUST GO THERE BRU"}
{"text":"Went to the one in Ajax with the wifey after we had done some outlet shopping. I had heard quite a bit about their burger but didn't go in there with any expectations. In my honest and humble opinion, it is without doubt, the best cheese burger that I have ever tasted. It has actually ruined the burger experience for me at other restaurants now because all other burgers taste sub par compared to Five Guys. The only other burger place that I feel was as good was Shake Shack in New York.  I think it is the American Cheese that I love so much. I had to give my complements to the manager at the time. I found the staff to be very friendly and the manager was coming around ensuring that everyone was happy with their order. Overall, a very positive experience. Nevertheless, that place is the Bomb Dot Com!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fat, juicy, MESSY burger then look no further!!  While out shopping with my mom one Saturday afternoon (ladies - we all know how exhausting and famishing a good shopping trip can be!) we decided to refuel at Five Guys.  Now, I have had their burgers before, but they were always when my mom would pick them up on the way home from work and let me tell you - you definitely want to order in and eat this bad boy right away because it tastes OH SO MUCH better!

Ordering is easy - pick your size (the regular sizes are HUGE - was enough for two meals for me), your toppings (whatever your little heart desires), and fries (don't be shocked when you see just how big the regular size is!).  Pay (the prices are great), then make your way over to the condiments section and grab as many napkins as humanly possible because you'll need them!  After a few minute wait, your order is up and now you can get ready to dig in!  What a treat for your taste buds - by far one of the best burgers I've laid my hands on (Yes - even better than many of the gourmet ones I've had).  You get A TON of food for the price and all of it tastes like a million bucks!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely good and priced very well. Cool coke machines, good cheeseburgers (free toppings) and free peanuts (like in the mid-west). The place also seems 1000x bigger than when Create was there. All the employees were VERY nice and helpful."}
{"text":"With a million burger places to choose from in this town, we have settled on this place to go on a regular basis. Very consistent is our orders, and the fries are much better than in n out."}
{"text":"Pretty meh for an expensive burger. The only reason they got 3 stars is because they use fresh jalapenos not pickled."}
{"text":"Staff ok, nothing special. Burgers ok, for the price and taste.  In and out beats five guys for price, taste and customer service. CAUTION- if you get fries and burger to go.. Grease went thru the paper bag and onto my car seat"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Always delicious and fast service! Split the Cajun fries between two people and go crazy mixing different soda flavors together."}
{"text":"After being contacted by the district manager, they offered to bring me back in to give them a try. I did so this Monday, I've gotta say it was much better this time around. Will be eating in house from now on. Thank you for excellent customer service."}
{"text":"They make your burger right when you order and put what you want on it, generously. The burgers are huge, juicy and super delicious! Fries are great! Make sure you try the Cajan. Spicy but so addictive! Plus you get free peanuts while you wait for your burgers! 

Keep in mind their portions are pretty big. A regular fries can definately be shared among two!"}
{"text":"Awesome new Five Guys with Shakes! Near the new Trader Joes at Downtown Summerlin off Sahara & 215! I ordered the Salted Caramel Shake & my husband tried the Oreo Shake! Usual great service & yummy burgers & fries! Very clean and friendly staff! YaY busy by noon tho!"}
{"text":"I have now tried the three new burger chains that have moved into the Tempe area.  Five Guys, Smashburger and Fatburger.  Five Guys was the worst of the three.  $11 for a burger, fries and drink!  The burger fell apart when I picked it up and didn't taste that good.  The fries had the most burnt pieces of fries in an order of fries I have ever had/seen.  (I worked in fast food in my youth and would never had given out this order of fries to a customer.)  The drink was colored water.  I went for ice tea at the self serve drink area and tried two different types of ice tea and both were like drinking water.  I should have expected that as a light on the ice tea machine was flashing and I saw employees look at it but just walk away.  Also, one of the two ice/soda machines had a sign taped on it advising customers to use the other machine.  (This location is pretty new and I saw an armoured car make a pickup while I was there.  Well at the prices they charge, no surprise at how much money they are taking in.  Perhaps Five Guys would like to take some of that money and fix the ice tea and the one ice/soda machine.)

I didn't even go during the lunch or dinner rush, 2:00 p.m.!  Also, after I paid for my order, I selected a small table and left some napkins and a copy of a weekly newspaper that I planned to read while eating on the table.  I then went to get my colored water (ice tea) and went back to my table to wait for my order to be called.  When I returned to my table, my napkins and newspaper were gone!  Yes, I found the newspaper in the trash can by the table.  A couple of employees were cleaning tables in the area and had seen me put my stuff on the table and I even said \"Excuse me.\" to them as I squeezed by them on the way to the ice tea machine.

I didn't mention that the burger came with two patties, it doesn't state that and I would have gone with a one patty burger since that is what I thought I was ordering and it would have (and should have) been cheaper.

Did I also mention the lettuce was pale (almost white) and the fries that weren't burnt weren't that great?

Smashburger and Fatburger do burgers and fries better."}
{"text":"Been hearing about the place.  Walked in every table was dirty so I had to set outside.  The guy at the register cared less that I was there.  

Burger, Fry and a drink. $14.11!!!!  Really!!!

Call your number and it's pilled in a brown bag with all the grease leaking threw.  Was so appetizing to get.  Burger like a drive in, fries terrible.
#Sorrywontbebackever

I can go to any Old Town restaurant and get a quality burger with service for the same money."}
{"text":"Lots of negativity in these reviews but if they didn't have their act together when they first opened then they seem to have gotten their act together now. I still prefer In N Out's burgers, but this was a similar preparation (very fresh, made on the spot) and it's not 20 miles away from my house, so I know where I'll be going. Their fries are fresh and twice cooked, so they literally blow In N Out's limp, useless fries out of the water. Be advised: one small order if fries is more than enough for two people, and the standard burger is a double decker (ask for the \"little\" burger if you want what is usually considered \"standard\"). The atmosphere, such as it is, is a lot like In N Out, utilitarian and clean. They have cute little touches like free peanuts and they stack their bags of raw potatoes and jugs of peanut oil in the middle of the restaurant, I suppose to show you how fresh their fries are. The cajun fries are not cajun nor particularly tasty, but their regular fries are awesome city. I love that they don't skimp on the toppings and they kinda compress the burger as they wrap it in the foil. It comes out like a delicious, multi-colored hockey puck. 

As regards the price, I don't understand why people are going on about how expensive it is. Two burgers, two orders of fries and two bottled waters set us back fifteen bucks, and we couldn't eat it all. Seriously, haven't you complainers ever heard of Burger King? I hear you can get a Whopper Jr. for a dollar there!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!  Offered to let us take some peanuts to go.

The soda machines are awesome with 200 different types of soda combinations.  One of the soda machines broke while we were there so took a little longer to wait for the other machine."}
{"text":"Grease pit. Treats employees incredibly badly. Stay Away."}
{"text":"Five Guys is an excellent burger chain with two (soon to be three) in the Cleveland area. This one is at South Park Mall (the other open one is in Avon and the one opening soon is in Fairview Park) and is near the main entrance. It can only be entered from the outside. The space is pretty small and minimalist. The menu is short and sweet. I had the bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. I also got an order of their fries (they also have Cajun fries which sound great). The burger was phenomenal. The two patties were juicy and flavorful. It was a nice, big burger, but not so big that you feel horribly obese after eating it. The fries were great. They were salty and full of flavor. They were also nice and thick. Overall, if you're looking for a great burger, head out to Five Guys and try one of their burgers. I guarantee you'll love it."}
{"text":"This place is super-fast and great service! The burgers are all world, and the fries are the best you'll ever eat. I ESP like the Cajon fries. You can always get a table, the service has consistently been excellent. You will love it! It's become one of my favorite places to eat. The outside eating area has plenty of tables. Check it out."}
{"text":"The spicy fries are amazing and on top of that they give you a whole lot of regular fries. 

The burgers are great and customizable in regards to your toppings. 

Free peanuts to snack on and free refills."}
{"text":"After a fun and filling Thanksgiving weekend I dread the trip to the airport to drop off my boyfriend.  We didn't want our Thanksgiving left overs and he said he wanted a burger.  Five Guys was the first thing that came to both of our minds. 
To my surprise, the restaurant was slow, as every other time I've been in a Five Guys they are very busy!  This was great for us because we didn't have a lot of time.  We ordered and filled our cups with delicious sugary soda concoctions from one of those amazing soda machines that you can put almost any flavor in your cup!  . We received our food in about 5 minutes.  Then we realized we had ordered regular fries instead of Cajun. (Who does that?!). No problem the employees  gave us 2 condiment cups of Cajun spice and a bag to shake on our fries... Perfect!  Almost better when you shake it on yourself... Weird.  Anyway, the fries were delicious.  I bit into my burger and realized there was a mix up in our order I had pickles on my burger.... Not good . So I brought my receipt with toppings and burger to the counter.  The young woman was super nice and changed my burger right away.  And my boyfriend got to eat my 'mistake burger'. 
The restaurant was super clean and the employees were extremely nice.  
I would recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Double bacon cheeseburger simply delicious. (Should have ordered the little one) The fries are the best I ever eaten. Hot, fresh, and perfectly salted. You can tell that the people working there enjoy what they are doing & that makes the food taste even better!"}
{"text":"Finally a burger place to replace that greasy burger joint we are all used to! Great tasting homemade burgers.  The fries are so fresh. Kids love this place because no one cares if they are talking to loud. Everyone seems happy to be there and you can order online to avoid a line! And yes there are free peanuts!"}
{"text":"Ate burger and fries at waterworks fox chapel.  I don't believe it was beef.  Absolutely a different taste and not good.  I have had good burgers but I am thinking possibly a different kind of meat?  Awful.  Never going back!"}
{"text":"I love five guys!! The Cajun fries are the best and the burgers are great. Everything is made as you order it, so always fresh. The workers are always friendly and offer extra things like peanuts or a water cup if they see you waiting. Love it!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see 5 Guys open up in AZ!  I first fell in love back in the 90's in VA.  I couldn't stop talking about how great the burgers and fries were and how you got free peanuts while you waited.  Finally I got to show my husband and friends what I've been talking about for years.  5 Guys, you did not disappoint!  As great as I remembered!  Real bacon, and you get to customize your buger just the way you want it.  Tons of fries that two can share.  Too bad I like the cajun and hubby likes the plain."}
{"text":"Very underwhelmed with the place this is my first time trying five guys. I agree the price is insane and the burger is above average nothing spectacular. Average Burger, fries and a drink should run you 15 in fast food type of setting."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The hamburger and fries are fresh...and custom made to your order.  The food is nice and hot right off the grill.  The service is always pleasant.  This is a \"eat and leave\" type of location, not a lounging and eating location.  Great food."}
{"text":"I tried  the burgers and fries at this place. I did not like the fries all that much but the burger was full of flavor and very juicy. I would go back whenever I am in the mood for a delicious burger!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience at this Five Guys about a weeks ago. Everyone working there was just so pleasant especially the guy taking our order. He had a huge smile on his face the whole time. The employees all seemed to be happy & had a good flow going as they made the burgers. The line moved quick & we got our food pretty fast. & the food was absolutely delicious!! I loved it!! The little cheeseburger is big & delicious & the little fries are big enough for two. I feel weird giving a fast food restaurant 5 stars but I have no reason to mark it down. Will most definitely return."}
{"text":"Five Guys is one of my favourite go-to burger joints. No frills, but always consistently great quality food. The salted peanuts for snacking are a big plus. 

Today I popped in for lunch and while the food was as good as always, this review is skewed by crappy service. 

My cashier (receipt says 247 Chante) was disinterested, bored, leaning on the counter behind the cash register and worst of all, 3 wide-mouth yawns that I caught while waiting to order and during ordering. I've always observed decent customer service from the Five Guys staff - nothing incredible but always welcoming and very friendly. Not this time.

I'll be back, hopefully 247 Chante learns what good customer service is all about."}
{"text":"Nice location, easy parking. The dining area is roomy. Clean restaurant. Everyone is friendly. It doesn't get a lot of traffic in the evening during the work week, so it's a great time to visit. 

Love the fries and the burgers!!"}
{"text":"I came on a weeknight during rush hour and this place had no line. I just walked right up. Everyone was friendly and smiling and talking to you. They kept the place clean. 

I grabbed my order to go and the burgers were delish. I love their fries - plain fries. I don't go for their other styles."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype for the burger. I had the reg . Bacon cheeseburger, it comes with two patties. The burger's are relatively expensive. The toppings are \"free\" , I think you pay for the topping's weather you get um or not. I got mine with lettuce , tomato , grilled onions , mayo , pickles , unfortunately they do not have thousand island dressing . The Cajun fries were very good. They also have \"free\" peanuts. Service was friendly. I will give it another try , though just in case I missed something."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers, great fries, and a chain feel. The burger I had (bacon cheeseburger) reminded me of a burger you'd find at your friends BBQ- nothing \"amazing\", but a \"fresh\" taste to it.

For what it is, it is over priced. Lower the prices and I'd give another star.

Better than Smash Burger and just plain different from In and Out Burger.

P.S. They validate for one hour of parking in the garage."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several time over the years and enjoy the food and concept.  I guess I just haven't been in a while.  The pricing for me has reached the tipping point.  Over $12 for a small burger, too many fries and a drink.  It's just not worth the price to me anymore."}
{"text":"Like the free toppings! Cajun fries are good as well. Got fresh fries since i asked for no salt. Convenient they have selections for hotdogs and sandwiches as well!"}
{"text":"Double Check Your Bills!

I normally love Five Guys, but I had a bad experience at this particular location.  I ordered a regular drink and the server handed me a large.  I asked if this was a regular drink and the cashier told me it was a promotion.  After I finished my meal I noticed on my receipt that I was charged a large drink.  In fact, my entire group was charged the same thing.  I know the difference is only 20 cent, but it's the principle.  

Caution to those who order at this location.  Double check your bills, and don't take any promotions."}
{"text":"The price for a drink, a bacon cheese burger and 2 fries?

sits around 20 dollars, so what does 20 dollars get you?

A cramped loud restaurant with yelling, fast food service and a soggy burger with processed cheese. Never again, I get better service and food at McDonalds for half the price."}
{"text":"Super friendly & welcoming staff. I got a regular cheeseburger with pickles, onions, & lettuce & everything was so fresh & delicious. I didn't know that the regular burgers were double patties so next time I will get a small one because they're so huge! A regular sized fry was more than enough for three people and were delicious as well! Nice & clean establishment too."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it is way overpriced, at an average of $15 for a lunch there are much better options on the maket and this includes signature restaurants with table service. The meat is not cooked to order the buns are very fast food style...in fact it is fast food at premium pricing"}
{"text":"Eh, good food but way over priced. Plus, it always makes me sick. Wish they would drop the price a bit. It shouldn't  cost $35 dollars between to people on two burger, a large fry, and two drinks. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice so far and the burgers are great.  They are consistently tasty and juice and the regular order of fries is large enough for two people to share.  They have my favorite hi-tech drink machines here with many varieties.  It's simple but good food.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is no drive-thru window."}
{"text":"It's an OK burger, no more. Expected much more after all the good reviews.
I did like being able to choose my toppings though, and they all seems fresh."}
{"text":"Veey good Service !
Hamburger is tasty and fresh, generous amount of chippes .
A lot of Greace"}
{"text":"Dayum! Dayum! Five guys satisfies your cravings!

I love five guys in my mouth! Yes, you read that wrong."}
{"text":"If you're from the East Coast, this'll remind of you of home.  If you're not, you are not only less predisposed to drop the term \"wicked\" at inappropriate times, you have no idea what kind of place this is.  Allow me to help explain it to you.

If there's one thing The Mustache loves, it is truth in advertising.  This joint calls itself Five Guys Burgers and Fries, and that's pretty much all you get.  They do have hot dogs and the like, but this place isn't called Five Guys Hot Dogs and Stuff, so why would you order such a thing?!  

The basic burger is a 2-patty model, you'll have to ask for the Junior Burger if one patty is all you'd like.  Toppings are ordered individually, and can be ordered on the side if you'd like to pack 'em on yourself.  If you are here at peak times, expect a line to the door (or even outside) and a pretty thorough hunt for a chair.

You'll have to wait a while here, which is made more difficult when you realize you're faced with watching them make your delicious burger right in front of you.  In an off-peak time I once received my burger in 10 minutes, but the average seems to be longer than that.  You have plenty of time to fetch your own drink, look for a chair that suits your fancy, and listen to the music.

That's right, music.  Burger joints don't tend to blare music anymore.  At Five Guys, you'll enjoy your favorite classic rock tunes as you dine.  That adds an element of fun to the atmosphere, which is already pretty laid-back.

Peanuts are stacked in boxes that separate the ordering area from the dining area, and the shells litter the floor at times.  Use caution while walking through the dining area for that very reason.  If you have a peanut allergy, you'll want to use extreme care to limit your exposure.  If you're a vegetarian, the peanuts are just about all you can eat here, so enjoy them in multitude!

When your number is called, your burger is served to you in a paper bag that also contains your fries if you ordered them.  A trick I like to use is removing everything from the bag, cutting it open, and dumping the fries onto it.  You'll quickly learn why...the bag absorbs at least some of the ample grease held inside the fries.  They are also cooked skin-on, which is an acquired taste for many.  You can order them Cajun Style, I found that to be overwhelming and have not ordered them that way since.  Lightly salted is perfect.

The burgers themselves are phenomenal.  Well-cooked and a perfect mate to the cheese melting atop it.  Lettuce is crisp and not overwhelming, you're not going to get the feeling that you're biting into a lettuce head each time.

So why not 5-stars?  Others have alluded to this...it is pricey for what you get.  The food is great, the ambiance is good, the staff is cheerful, but you're paying a lot for that when you can go down the road to In 'n Out Burger and pay a few bucks less for something almost as good.  That's going to be a personal decision, and I've already heard of wars breaking out between the Five Guys and In 'n Out camps.  Pretty wicked indeed."}

History

1986: The first Five Guys location opens in Arlington, VA.

1986 - 2001: Five Guys opens five locations around the DC metro-area and perfected their business of making burgers... and starts to build a cult-like following.

2002: Five Guys decides DC metro-area residents shouldn't be the only ones to experience their burgers and start to franchise in Virginia and Maryland.

2003: Five Guys sells out of franchise territory within 18 months and starts to open the rest of the country for franchise rights.

2003 - Present: Five Guys expands to over 1,000 locations in 47 states and 6 Canadian provinces.

We use only Peanut oil."}
{"text":"It's a fast-food burger chain that isn't like most fast-food burger chains.

This place blows chain burger joints out of the water. The only thing I get hung up on is the price - $15 for a regular burger (double), fries and a fountain drink. Local restaurants that offer better burgers charge less. With that price, I only go once in a blue moon.

The first time I went they filled the bag with fries, but the last time I went they didn't, so I don't know what that is all about. It's probably for the better because the fries went to waste on my first visit because there were way too many.

As for the burgers, they're good. I haven't had a bad experience. The meat and the toppings taste fresh. No complaints there."}
{"text":"One of the \"Guys\" must have been out on this visit.  It took 30 minutes just for a regular fry.  The fries here are good, but not that good.  The crew needs to step it up a bit.  There wasn't really a \"rush.\"  It was more like a traffic jam of orders.  The order after mine was called out before mine (mind you they had two big bags of food).  I was extremely displeased when the crew member said \"they ran out of fries and had to make some more.\"  Of course they did!  It's fast food and with a store that prides itself on fresh potatoes, this store was most likely using them for decoration, vice in the fryer.  Dining room was pretty messy too (food on table and floors).  Please fix this!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to go to this cool burger and fries joint. They also surprised me with other options like hot dogs, free toppings for big burgers.  I wasn't too hungry so I tried the veggie burger which was pretty good.  When we left at like 1230 the place was doing very well.  I want to give a big shout out to Tatiana for making me the best fries I've ever had, crispy, tasty,  and flavorful.  Every one was nice and sincere there and helpful. I have to say Tatiana is the best employee with a smile on her face and treated me nice. Which makes me say I will be back soon!  5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Good burger and Fri's  very fresh burger. Very clean got waited on fast cook to order like it will go back"}
{"text":"The first time I heard about them was from my University Professor who came to class every time with a drink from there, and he has a pretty good taste, so I had to go and look for myself, they have the best burger ever, I love meat and I'm really picky when it comes to meat, but I have to say I wasn't disappointed. It was a success."}
{"text":"Love the friendly, laid back atmosphere, and the burgers are to die for!  Moist, juicy and fresh, especially with the grilled onions and mushrooms. The fries are the best ever, and you get soooo many of them!  I am sold!"}
{"text":"Good Burger but would recommend getting it to go. To freakin noisy in there mainly the staff."}
{"text":"I have been to Five Guys a total of three times.  Each time I have ordered a burger, I have inevitably bitten into a piece of bone or gristle.  Regardless of how good a burger might taste, I never want this kind of surprise and it ruins the meal for me."}
{"text":"Every time I drive by this place it's packed. So we decided to give it a try. The burgers are good, big and you can get your buger your way. The fries are fresh cut and you're informed of where the potatos are coming from that are making your fries. A small order of fries severs 2 no problem. Can't go wrong at this place... Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Five Guys Burger is great. Just like my skills on the basketball court. Some say I only go right when I drive to the basket, but that's what I want you to think. Don't get me started about my post game..."}
{"text":"Great experience!  The food was made to order, and the fries are excellent!

The entire staff is friendly, especially Lindsey.  She was wonderful and made our visit even better!

Burgers are very tasty, but maybe just a \"little\" pricey.  

Overall a great time - we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place! The burgers are so juicy and good! It's better than in and out really recommend this place! They even give you nuts why you wait for your food which takes about 5 minutes"}
{"text":"The five guys on central Ave have a cook with a nasty beard cooking the food with no beard cover it is terrible made me not want anything"}
{"text":"My favorite burger spot , From Alexandria VA to Montreal QC....great service, fast and on point!"}
{"text":"The girl behind the counter was very welcoming and pleasant. She asked us how our weekend was going - a little thing that goes a long way for a quality experience. The restaurant was very clean, which was confirmed by their 99.0 sanitation rating on the wall. Great place & we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food is always great. However the customer service I received from the gentlemen made me feel awkward. Completely stale, and kind of snooty.. Look, I understand you make not like your job but at least try to not make others feel the way you feel. The cook, was a lady, and she was nice and made up for his lack of customer service."}
{"text":"I wish I had read the reviews before ordering here.  The fries were great and the burger was s solid burger but lacked a bit of   Spice.   Good overall experience."}
{"text":"I ordered a little hamburger with little fries for my lunch on a Saturday.  I would say the burgers and the ingredients are pretty good and fresh, especially the beef patty.  My mom tried a small bite and she said it is much better than the patty at the McDonald's.  Also, I ordered the \"little\" fries but the person gave me a significant portion that I think it is pretty large compare to McDonald's small fries!  I would recommend this place, just the burgers are little pricey.  I would want to try their hot dog next time :)"}
{"text":"I know, I know.  It's fattening.  I feel like garbage after I eat here.  But when I'm in a fast food burger mood and this place is nearby, I'll take this place 10 of 10 times if my choices are McD's, BK, etc.  God bless you Junior Bacon Cheeseburger.

And then when I'm on the treadmill the following day, I'm thinking...what the hell was I thinking?  But I'll still be back."}
{"text":"This place was a total waste of time.  My friend and I did a long bike ride, and found ourselves craving burgers.  We considered our options, and decided to go with Five Guys because it was close to my house, would give us  a chance to check out Cityscape, and our president famously ate there shortly after taking up residence in the White House.  I am SO not impressed.  I ordered the little burger, which is a single patty, and the fries.  I got way too many fries, and there wasn't any ranch dressing evident into which I could dip them.  So, I was not inclined to eat my fries at all.  The burger was ok.  The big sacks of potatoes in the middle of the restaurant was not appealing (pun intended).  The place was noisy; the music was too loud for conversation.  And the Cityscape development is lame."}
{"text":"I was marathon watching Wahlburgers all morning and started craving a burger. Got the party melt with everything and a little fries. If you've ever been to Five Guys before, you know the little fries are anything but little.This definitely hit the spot. My only issue was that the patties were under seasoned. A hit or two of salt would've made it amazing:-)"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!  It's quick and delicious. I usually get a bacon double cheeseburger with the works. They offer a lot of toppings and they are all free.  The burger is so big it's hard to bite, but you'll figure it out.  Their Cajun fries are off the charts, and they HOOK..IT..UP! The bottom of your bag is always filled with em'.  

For a place where you get your food in five minutes, you can't beat it. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because it is a little expensive. You can easily spend 12 bucks here if you get a double cheeseburger, fries and a drink.

My favorite thing about Five Guys is that they offer peanuts while you wait.  That's right, you can enjoy the nuts of Five Guys in your mouth for free. The jokes about Five Guys salty nuts never get old, and really help to pass the time while you wait for your food.  It's the lingering taste of Five Guys nuts that will keep you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Five Guys will ruin other burger joints for you. One stop here and you'll understand that burgers and fries can reach a whole new level."}
{"text":"The only reason this place received a 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because it's very pricey for 2 people at a fast food restaurant.  However, as soon as we walked in, the staff greeted us right away and they were extremely friendly. The place was clean and organized. The double bacon cheeseburger  was fantastic and French fries was amazing. Regardless of the price...we will most definitely come back again."}
{"text":"When Five Guys opened down here, my wife and I were thrilled to give it another chance.  We'd tried it once before, at a different location, and we'd not been impressed.  Now that we've been able to truly try it, we're in love.  It's not on the same level as an In-N-Out burger for me, but it's close.

The layout of the restaurant is pretty bad, honestly.  I couldn't imagine actually eating here because it is so claustrophobic.  We always use the smart phone app to order our food ahead of time, which is super easy and convenient, and then we just check in at the register and our food is ready as soon as our freshly dropped fries come out of the fryer.

The fries aren't crispy - so if that's your thing, go elsewhere.  But if you don't mind slightly soggy fries, either seasoned with salt or Cajun seasoning (a little bit of a kick!), you'll be in love.

The burgers are straight-forward enough, with plenty of options of sauces (A1, BBQ, ketchup, mustard).  We like getting ours in a bowl, for ease of eating.  I like taking mine home and customizing it a bit with some feta cheese and balsamic glaze, but that's just me.

If you want fast food and are disenchanted with other places, give Five Guys a chance to make you happy.  If all fails (which it shouldn't), their Coke Freestyle machine is sure to please anybody with its 80 kajillion options (by my personal estimate)."}
{"text":"Such bullshit! They are suppose to be open until 4am ... Showed up at 3:30am tonight, and they were closed! Do not advertise being open until 4am if you do not stay open until that time of night! Wanted to get the best burger in town ... Instead I got McDicks ... Such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"The burger was great. Ordered to go. The bad is that the fries were very soggy and not crisp at all."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the food here.  The burger was mediocre (patty is thin and dry), the buns are way too thick and overwhelm the burger itself, and the fries are way too greasy.  You'll fare better going to Johnny Rockets for a burger just a few stores down."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best burgers in Montreal.  Somewhat expensive, but well worth it.  You have to have the Cajun fries with which they are very generous"}
{"text":"People seem to love it here but I just don't get it.  Feels like more hype than substance.  Don't get me wrong, the food was ok; I just think it's way overpriced. It's as if they package it small to give the appearance of getting more than you do. I know I'm focusing on price here but when you are going for fast food you're generally not looking to spend a lot. Hey, tons of free peanuts everywhere. Just scoop them up from any of the open boxes around the store. 

Basically I had a regular double cheeseburger, fries and a soft drink. The regular size fries I know from experience is a lot, more fries than any one person should eat. So I go with the \"little\" size, almost $3 and I'll say it was a small to normal size portion of fries. They were ok, some tasted over cooked and a little greasy but hey...it's fries right? The container for the fries itself was really small but it overflows into the bag. 

The burger was $6.79, I mean really? It was 2 above average sized patties which were somewhat over cooked. The cheese was not melted, just hard and cold like in a cheese sandwich. The toppings, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, raw onions, tasted fresh and you can have any toppings you want for the price. It was a large list to choose from. The bun was fairly small, so the topping amounts they can fit on the burger were very limited by the size of the bun. Typical sponge dough like bread that that falls apart as you eat. It comes to you wrapped in Reynolds Wrap-like foil. 

The small soda, 20 ounces, was $2.39, and other than the fancy multiple favors machine it was just a soft drink beverage. I pay 2.39 for a beverage in any restaurant served in a glass, table service, comfortable place to sit and some casual ambience. 

The interior of the place is very basic with aluminum chairs made to look like wood. It feels more like you are in the kitchen with the stark white walls and fluorescent lighting. 

The employees very friendly people though. I get the impression that they deal with sticker-shock a lot as they are ready with their answers of proposed value when I commented on price. Pictures included here. 

Total price for a burger, fries and soda was $12.84 with tax. If I had ordered the regular sized fries which most would normally do this would have been over $14.00 with tax. Four people would be $56.00. Like I said, I just don't get it. Lots of price, no substance."}
{"text":"I have never been to a 5 Guys I didn't enjoy and this one is no different. I have gotten to where I order small fries because they overload the fry cup so much. Plus, I would much rather eat the peanuts than the fries anyway. This particular store is in the historic Steelyard area, close to several big box stores and other chain restaurants. I found the burgers consistent with every other 5 Guys I have been to, and the staff in this store was particularly friendly. It wasn't crowded the night I was there, but it was home opening day for the Indians."}
{"text":"Good luck being a girl and not getting uncomfortably hit on by the staff."}
{"text":"Service was good. Liked the Cajun fries but the rest of the food was greasy and mediocre. .."}
{"text":"I've come here several times now and everything I've tried is excellent. The burgers are made to order and are super juicy. The heaping mounds of fries may not help my waistline, but they are addictive. Although there is a bit of a wait for the burger, the free peanuts help pass the time. The best advice I can give first timers is to choose their toppings wisely. I once ordered nearly every condiment and couldn't fit the resulting behemoth in my mouth. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Best burgers downtown! 
Great food, fair price, always friendly staff! No complaints, 

Ps small fries are huge!"}
{"text":"easily one of my favorite burger places. great customer service. the fries are awesome. haven't tried the new milkshakes yet. will soon!"}
{"text":"I love the burgers! And I can't say enough about the Fries! My daughter gets most excited about the complimentary peanuts we get while are food is being prepared."}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food was gross ! I found a string of hair on my fries. Maybe I will try a different location next time."}
{"text":"Ordered for take out got the bacon cheeseburger with Cajun fries.  The burger itself was pretty delicious and personally I love the Cajun fries however I can see how many people complain about the Cajun fries being way too salty.  Of course the best part of five guys is the feeling when they overload your bag with the fries! My only issue is the pricing.  My only complaint are that the burgers are very pricey with nothing outstanding compared to other great burger joints."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and I have yet to be disappointed.  Build your own burgers that are juicy,  delicious and can be wrapped in lettuce...it beats any fast food burger and many sit down restaurants. The multi option coke machine is fun, but can get backed up when it's peak earing time.

Note: the regular size fries are plenty enough to share with someone."}
{"text":"I ordered a small hamburger with everything and the cajun fries. The food tasted like I made it at home and through on some condiments from the fridge. The cajun fries were greasy and had a fishy smell that when mixed with the smell of the oily paperbag made me queezy. After I ate it I headed back home and had an ice cream sandwich and just tried to forget I ever went out to eat."}
{"text":"I've had Five Guys before while in Pennsylvania and thought it was good. Not any better or worse then In-Out or Fatburger. Tried this location the other night though and was disappointed. Lettuce was slimey,buns soggy and the doneness of the patties, inconsistent.  I'm not completely writing them off but will be in no huge rush to return."}
{"text":"Great staff, good food, no pink slime, quality ingredients.  Love this place.  Too pricey, but I'd rather pay more and get quality, than to get pink slime like other fast food places.  Very clean as well!  Cooked to order!"}
{"text":"Dirty inside.  Not like other five guys stores I've been to.  And when I e-mailed the company, I got a standard, middle finger reply.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. Finally came to know what the fuss was all about. Hands down these guys know how to make burgers. 

Don't think I ll be ever eating in mc dees again."}
{"text":"This is my spot for a good five guys burger! I always order ahead via smartphone app and the order is always done right on time. The quick friendly service has made this location a favorite for the past 2 years I've been in kent."}
{"text":"This is your typical Five Guys restaurant. The burgers are delicious. Note that the standard burger is a double patty (if you want a single patty order the \"little\" burger). A burger with fries and a drink is about $16 -- a bit steep but the food is good. Unfortunately this place doesn't have free peanuts like other Five Guys but it does have a convenient downtown location."}
{"text":"Guilty pleasure. BUT incredible. When ever my will is broke, I will come here. 
Love the soda machine....too many choices!!!"}
{"text":"awesome burgers...awesome fries....awesome coke machine. when i crave some juicy meat this is a go to place. never disappoints."}
{"text":"If your in the mood for some fast food, or its your cheat day for your diet and you want a burger, do yourself a favor and skip those other fast food joints and head to five guys! Hands down the best quality burger when it comes to fast food and I haven't even mentioned to fresh cut fries. With a great staff and clean restaurant five guys earns the prize. 5stars"}
{"text":"Five Guys was on my \"got to try\" list so I stopped in while in Vegas recently.  The burgers were good, better than your normal chain restaurants in town but I would stop short of saying they are \"exceptional\".  I do give the staff five stars for being extremely friendly and energetic but the food is only slightly better than average."}
{"text":"I wanted a good burger at a decent price. 
Here I got neither. 
A burger, fries and coke = $17!!!?? 
fine, if the meal is great I'll begrudgingly buy it. 

But! their service at this place is appalling. 
They have a punk kid who doesn't really want to work there (it shows) and they have a cashier that likes to call their customers liars if your order was wrong. I know what I ordered, I don't really get how I cannot know what I ordered. 

Besides this, once my order was completed it just sat there for a long time. I waited and waited to be called. I finally decided to ask and they said..\"oh, here's your order.\" At that point I didn't want it. I was so fed up with their service. 
They offered it to me for free but I said, no. 
I got my refund and left."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Ordered two burgers and a large cajun fry to share. We waited for about 15mins for our food. Normally we would not have minded but we were the ONLY people in the place. When we got our food our fries were not cajun so we brought them back to the counter. The gentleman at the counter, larger guy with glasses, asked us if we want them remade, we said yes. Then he said, \"Actually, here is some seasoning\" He gave us one container of cajun seasoning. We said we would prefer them remade, it tastes great fresh and with the seasoning. At that point, he was ignoring us so we just went back to our table and began eating. 

I'm not impressed with their lack of customer service. We ordered something, we should get it. I've had much better service at the location on Val Vista and Baseline at Dana Park. I would drive the extra miles to get great service and quality food."}
{"text":"Small burger, Small fry, Small drink = $10

Burger -- Tomato and Lettuce were fresh and good.  Bun \"collapsed\" and became that gooey fake white bread bun that you can see where your hand grabbed the burger.  The patty/cheese was fine, I guess...but I didn't get any real flavor from it.

Fries -- They use \"real\" potatoes, but the fries are flavorless.  But at least they're greasy!

Soda -- Kudos for a good selection, including two diet-caffeine-free choices, something I've never seen before!

I'm not a fanboy of In-n-Out, but at least they know to charge a reasonable price for their food (which is much better than Five Guys).

In summary...this place is the emperor with no clothes.  And they want you to know that lots of newspapers around the country think they're great...the reviews are all over the walls.  Perhaps they're trying to convince patrons that their tastebuds and pocketbook are lying..."}
{"text":"It's very rare that I post a review... Five Guys food speaks for itself. But if the guy at this location that screams \"RAZZLE DAZZLE\" doesn't knock it off I'm driving over to the Flamingo location instead. Most annoying experience ever!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger in town is five guys..  They got it right!!!  Bacon is perfectly crisp and the location in Scottsdale as a great drink dispenser that give the option of 20+ soda choices.  I am not a fan of their fries however, I love their burgers and hot dogs."}
{"text":"Foods usually really good! However if you order food online or through the app it's ALWAYS ready 10minutes later than the time it's supposed to. I appreciate that it's fresh but if your on a tight time frame like I usually am it's really frustrating! I don't know if they need to add more time on the app to make the food ready on time but I've never arrived and had my food ready or close to ready :("}
{"text":"Les frites et hamburger sont super bons!! Je pourrais dire que ce sont les meilleurs que j'ai jamais mang√©! Par contre, c'est plus savoureux √† Sainte-Catherine qu'√† des Sources. Les frites sont meilleures normales qu'avec plus d'√©pices. Les milkshakes ont un tr√®s bon formant, mais trop sucr√©s. J'imagine que comme la plupart des milkshakes. Les deux d√©fauts visibles sont les prix, assez √©lev√©s! Et la grande attente pour recevoir ta commande. C'est assez long. Cependant, c'est recommand√©!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, and healthy portion of fries.

What I like the most is the choice of toppings. Fried onions and mushrooms, simply awesome.

I have had these burgers before in Vancouver and in Nee York. Always a good burger."}
{"text":"Have ate here numerous times, expensive but very juicy burgers. They dump a whole bunch of extra fries in each order too. Sometimes be prepared for a long lineup."}
{"text":"meh....cold...dry...overpriced...14.99 for a gross Burger...garbage ..."}
{"text":"I have visited this place on a number of occasions and I have never been disappointed in the way the food tastes. I usually go to the one on Warden in Scarborough but I've tried other locations as well. The taste is always consistent and the burgers are always taste fresh which I love. I usually get a small burger with cheese and fries. Although the burger is the star, one cannot overlook the delicious home-cut fries. The decor is consistent with their branding. My only gripe about the place is that it's a bit expensive, but that hasn't stopped me from going."}
{"text":"I ate here three times and the food was perfect every time. I had a juicy hamburger and french fries. My order was perfect and the service was fast. By far this is my favorite hamburger place."}
{"text":"Five Guys is a chain-franchise masquerading as a local burger joint. Their burgers are all right but overpriced and greasy"}
{"text":"I come with my wife about 4 times a month, its our favorate place to eat hamburgers! Although, a little pricey, the service and food makes up for it! Came in today for lunch and they had a line out the door (like usual) and was served in a very timely manner. The staff was staying busy and the restraunt is always spot on clean. The manager put on a show by being all over the place, he was very fast and extremely helpful not only to his staff but everyone in the store. I recommend this place to everyone. They serve hot dogs and hamburgers with countless topping items! Also there fries are to die for, I always get the spicey cajun!"}
{"text":"Portions are so big! We were able to save our lunch for dinner. Large fries filled the cup and the cook added another large scoop of fries to the bag. Burgers were gigantic and freshly made. We can share one burger next time."}
{"text":"I have been to five guys on several occasions. Love the burgers and fresh fries. On this visit the man running the register gave us great advice on ordering fries a certain way which saved me some cash and still gave my family plenty of fries.  

This isn't the cheapest burger joint in town but the food is good and fresh. It's a nice treat and a good break from the usual fast food grind."}
{"text":"Good real hamburger, but I'm really disappointed in the the front of the house.  It's just like everything else in Scarborough.  After a few weeks of being open, the \"new canadians\" throw trash on the floor, and leave stuff all over the tables.  On Fathers day, there was 1 clean table to choose from.
I've visited 3 stores in the states and all three had a staff member working on tables lining up chairs sweeping the floor etc.  If the eating part looks like crap what will the washrooms look like.  I was thrilled they were coming to Toronto, but wish they would keep it clean!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are really good and if you like fries then you are in luck.  However, the music is a bit loud, and I do agree with another reviewer that the employees should be more quiet.  They must have a policy of bothering the customers whic h is a slight turn off.  They make your food quickly which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I wanted to find this place overrated, but it is seriously good. The burger was perfectly done, love the choice of toppings including A-1, and the fries are fantastic and plentiful. Excellent service from the guy who fried and bagged it all. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So my east-coast visiting aunt & uncle have never been to Vegas and never been to In-N-Out either, so of course I took them to the In-N-Out on Craig.  They liked the burgers at In-N-Out but seemed to think a place back east called 5 Guys was even better.  Low and behold, on our way out of the In-N-Out parking lot, my uncle sees the 5 Guys sign right across the street. How 'bout that!  I never even knew the place existed before last week, and I drive by here all the time.

So took the GF to 5 Guys last night just to see if my relatives were right.  They weren't.  I love them dearly, but as far as the burgers go, In-N-Out has this place beat hands down.

The issue is the meat.  It is greasy and relatively flavorless at 5 Guys.  The toppings are as fresh and delicious as In-N-Out, but the buns aren't quite up to In-N-Out par and the burger meat just falls short. 

Also, as I read in many reviews, they got our order wrong too. Yes I ordered properly - telling them what to put on it, not what to take off. The order-taker got it right on the receipt, but someone decided to put onions on my burger anyway. I hate onions. Took it back & the nice guy at the counter apologized & told me to keep the burger - he'd make me a fresh one.  Much better response than taking it back and throwing it out or, worse, trying to get away with picking them off. Onions seep - I've busted places trying to do this to me before. Not 5 Guys though - the correction was made in two minutes flat and another sincere apology when picking up the corrected burger. Lesson here is nobody is perfect, but 5 Guys seems to F-up far more often than they should given their \"BYOB\" style of menu, so check the contents of your grease-soaked bag before you leave if you're taking it to-go.

I did prefer the 5 Guys fries - got mine Cajun style and yea, they were pretty spicy. Figured they would be - kind of the definition of \"Cajun\" isn't it?  Why do so many reviewers get surprised by this? Mine were also greasy, soft and salty, but that's the way I like them.

The portions are HUGE.  Standard burger is a double patty, which was more than enough for me and I'm usually a 3-by-3 guy at In-N-Out.  The fries were ridiculously large, which ticked me off because my GF hates spicy stuff and I wanted to try the Cajun fries, so we had to get two separate small orders of fries at $2.89 per order. Then they come out and each order must be well over a pound of fries.  Why even have a \"small\" order of fries on the menu if you can't get one?  Charge me $2.00 and give me 1/3 the amount of fries and I'd be happier.  They were yummy too, so it was a damn shame to throw so many away.

I was no big fan of the bright lights or loud music either, but didn't find either unbearable - mildly annoying perhaps, but not enough for me to bash them on it. The fries might bring me back here because the burger wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything special, and I did like the spicy Cajun seasoning on the soft, thick, wilted, natural-cut fries. In-N-Out fries are too thin, small and tasteless for me.  

On second thought, maybe I'll just drive through In-N-Out for a burger then shoot over to 5 Guys for an order of fries if I want the perfect meal.  Too bad neither one of them can get everything right. (sigh)

Neither 5 Guys nor In-N-Out lives up to all the hype in my opinion, but In-N-Out comes closer. 5 Guys might be good enough as they are for the east-coasters that can't get an In-N-Out burger, but they had better get some more flavorful patties and find a way to get some of that grease off the grill if they want to make it big out west. 

Stop in if you want to spend slightly more $money$ than you should on an overrated burger place, but only if you're in the area and want something fairly unique. I wouldn't go out of my way just for a 5 Guys meal though, and those that would probably grew up on the things back east and have a geographical affinity for them more than they do an actual appreciation of a tasty burger."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout, ala the Bacon Cheeseburger, \"all the way\" with some Cajun fries. I guess it's MY fault for not checking my Bacon Cheeseburger for the G.D. BACON before I left!!! 

I am sorry Five Guys, but no matter how fresh your 'taters are, no matter how cool it is to crack peanuts in line, no matter how good my burger was, sans pig, you can't forget a basic function like putting the BACON ON A BACON CHEESEBURGER. Yes I checked the receipt. 

Probably the same reason your bathrooms were filthy. Wifey said it looked there was a diaper party for two year-olds and hobos in the ladies room. She couldn't use it and didn't tell me 'til home because she knew I would have publicly embarrassed you in front of your potatoes and peanuts. You owe her... really. 

My baconless leftovers went in the trash after I learned about the bathroom. Permanently disgusted and won't go back."}
{"text":"I've tried quite a few bacon hot dogs, none like this. They don't break the bacon up into itty bitty pieces, they just put a slice of bacon on it. Could've been a little less ketchup on it, but other than that it's actually a really decent place to eat when staying in Toronto.

Burgers are also fantastic, award-winning as well. Ever need a place to eat that's high-quality fast food, this is the place to go to. Going back soon, I can assure you of this."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and just stopped into for fries. Took a while but it's the holiday season so I won't hold that against them. Fries were tasty and you get a lot for $6! Well seasoned and tasty as always!! I'm sure I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"If the pricing was inline -4 stars, I'm sorry burger, fries and drink should not be 12 dollars plus this is not a 7 dollar burger - in and out wins"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during break from work. Had the bacon cheese burger. Good and quick service. But probably more importantly, burgers were not as great as I've heard, especially since they use processed cheese."}
{"text":"The ONLY good thing about this place are their fries.  You get a huge portion of them.  We got the cajun fries and they were delicious.  I wish I could say the same for their burger.  I got the single patty, I can't eat those massive burgers and fries.

The bun was boring, the lettuce, typical.  Free toppings aren't impressive either.

I don't live close, but I was told to try this place.   I am used to Gourmet Burger or Hero Burger as they are far superior to this place as far as fast food burger places are concerned."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with 5 Guys.  Burgers are fresh and made to order.  Fries are great with either seasoning."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best burgers around!!  You pick all your toppings and the burgers are cooked perfectly.  The french fries actually taste like potatoes instead of grease too."}
{"text":"A great place to get a quick bite to eat.  This place provides great food at the right price.  You get a huge burger with anything you can image on it.  They all taste good.  Having the everything was the way to go with the jalapenos.  The small was one hamburger patty.  Definitely a place to visit again.  The roasted peanuts were great."}
{"text":"If you've been to a Five Guys, or a burger joint in general, you know what to expect here. The service is reasonably fast, and the burgers are delicious. They have big crates of peanuts to snack on while you wait, and the staff is friendly.

I'm giving them three stars because there's nothing exceptional going on here. A lot of people freak out about these burger joints that have spread in the past few years, but they're all very similar, and they're all pretty good. Wake me up when somebody does something new.

PRO TIP: After you order, they give you a number. Use your ears, and listen for them to call that number, which will indicate when your food is ready. You'd be amazed at how many people I see just wander around without their food while the staff calls their number over and over again. If you weren't hungry, you shouldn't have come here!"}
{"text":"Yes it is very good. Yes it is too expensive for what you get. However, if I'm in the mood for a juicy delicious burger and fries as a once and a while thing and not an everyday thing, I would much rather have the $10 burger and fries here than at applebees around the corner."}
{"text":"Great food but not worth waiting 30 minutes for. No place to sit, hardly room to stand. Why to much noise."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger!
Great service!
Cajun fries are really good!  The fry portions are huge!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Free peanuts so cool. I ordered a Bacon cheese burger was okay. I was expecting more since hearing and reading good reviews. You can order a large size ( a whole paper bag filled)  of fries since we had a huge party. Cashier recommended which was nice of her to save $ from ordering individually."}
{"text":"Called in to place a pick up order. Lady on the other side put me on hold. Never came back. So I put in my Bluetooth on. Still on hold on my way there. When I arrived they were crazy busy. Which I understand why they didn't take the order. If they would just said that. I would've understood. Communication is the key to success."}
{"text":"I have never been here before so I was wondering what the peanuts, potatoes and peanut oil stacked up were about. The peanuts are for customers to snack on before the meal and the potatoes and peanut oil are the stock they use during the day. A customer is able to see the fresh ingredients they use every day. Moving on. I asked the employee what he recommended after determining that he was not a vegetarian, vegan or one of those people that eat out of trash cans. He recommended what he gets, a bacon cheeseburger with onions mushrooms and bbq sauce. Note: He recommended the A-1 steaksauce. It is always a good sign when an employee eats where they work. Now I think is a good time to describe myself I am indistinguishable from a hobo except for no smell and a $400 phone. Unshaved with a 10 year old shirt and shorts and hair all bed slept. They were courteous and friendly to me. I just don't feel the need to dress up to go to do my business which is why I was over on this side of town. Down to the food now. The fries were delicious, fresh and well seasoned. The burger was good not spectacular I would probably sear it more but still good. The ambiance was nice with good music from the 80's, 70's and 60's playing. The sound system seems to be bad at the low end to the point you wish the loud songs would get over quick. It was enjoyable enough that I will be bringing my kids here next week. I am giving it 4.5 stars but I will mark 5 stars as you cannot give half stars. Improvements I would like to see but probably never would are: a new sound system and a sear burner for the burgers."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the worst five guys experience, ever.  Burgers were over cooked and dry.  The fries were limp."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Five Guys a couple of times before and the burgers were delicious! Today we decided to try something different and went with the grilled cheese and the bacon cheese hot dog. As far as the grilled cheese is concerned, I have made better sandwiches at home. A little more creativity could've been put into the sandwich besides using what looked like upside down hamburger buns. Very disappointing to pay $4.39 for a sandwich that was not much bigger than the palm of my hand. The hot dog wasn't any better. Again we have made better hotdogs at home. I prefer to eat a hotdog while it is intact, not cut in half like it was being given to a child. The hotdog was almost as crispy as the bacon. 

Perhaps it was the cook on duty, but it was one of the worst lunches we've had in a long time! Definitely won't be trying anything other than burgers."}
{"text":"If I was just grading on taste it would be a five star review, however when a family of four costs almost $40 it makes it hard to go back."}
{"text":"I went to Five Guys for the first time (North Scottsdale) to see what all the hubbub was and why everyone was comparing it to In 'N Out burger - a place I love and have been eating at for over 25 years (CA and AZ).  

Pros: wider assortment of toppings and menu items, including the veggie sandwich (not a soy pattie - just veggies and cheese, if you want; extra menu items like jalape√±os and hot sauce, grilled mushrooms, etc.; Cajun styled french fries (their small size is enormous).

Cons:  more expensive than In 'N Out. 

Neutral: Thick burgers are more like your home grilled burgers, all well done and crispy on the edges - not like In \"N Out's thinner patties.

I don't know why people compare the two places since the prices are not similar.  Five Guys is good, but should be compared more to places like Fat Burger, regarding size and price of burger.

I still prefer In \"N Out for taste and value."}
{"text":"Yay!!! I no longer have to drive 15 minutes away for my five guys cravings. 

Like any other five guys this location was no different same look an decor inside and the food was great as always. I love the Cajun fries and grilled jalape√±os in my burger."}
{"text":"Good, fast service, and the place is always clean.  It's a little expensive for fast food though."}
{"text":"everything fresh and abundance here.
free roasted peanuts will make you happy.
if you love burgers, here is the place but don't come at lunch hours, you will need to wait long before you get your burgers."}
{"text":"Burgers are just \"okay\" and the fries are good if you go on a day when the potatoes are fresh. Otherwise, you end up throwing away half the fries because they have nasty black spots on them. Everything is extremely over priced too. I can take my family to Red Robin and spend less money on WAY better food."}
{"text":"Was it good? Yes. Was it worth the 9 dollars for the burger? No. I like the fact that it's not frozen and made right in front of you, but dinner for two was over 40 dollars with one beverage. Crazy pricy. Great amount of food, couldn't get close to finishing the burger or fries. Will I be back? Probably not."}
{"text":"We tried Five Guys for the first time this weekend.  The food is very good and you get big portions so you don't leave hungry.  However the burger where actually very greasy.  We did not realize that the regular burger are all double patties, for a normal size burger you get what they call a little burger.  I would not normally order a double bacon cheese burger, but I did not realize this fact until our food arrived.  There is no sign letting you know they are double patty burgers.  It's cool that they have a whole list of topping and you just choose whatever you want on the burger.  Every thing is made fresh and to order.  Word of caution to those who have peanut allergies, everything is cooked in peanut oil and they have boxes of peanuts lining the entry way.  The place is very clean and the people working seemed very nice.  

The reason I only gave it 3 stars instead of 4 stars is due to the high price.  I would say this is in no way a 5 star place.  This is basically a glorified fast food place.  You come in and stand in line to order get your number and drinks and wait for them to yell out your number.  Weather or not you are dining in you get your food in a paper bag.  However, you pay prices like going to Red Robin or some sit down place, and the quality is not that of a sit down place.  My suggestion is to go a block down to Trop. and have In-N-Out and pay a fraction of the price or go someplace where they don't yell out numbers for you to pick up your food.  For 3 people (2 adults and 1 child) we paid almost $40, at In-N-Out we usually pay about $20.  I don't mind these prices if I am not having to stand in line to order and getting my food in a paper bag and then sitting in hard metal and plastic chairs.  

So my advice save the money and go to another fast food place, or spend maybe $10 more and go someplace where you can sit and have your order taken and get the higher quality."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food in a loud open dining area. The music was so loud I couldn't hear the person behind the counter, much less the person I was eating with. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I had the burger and some fries.

Nothing special in the taste department.

Staff was friendly and helpful, happy with the service."}
{"text":"I LOVE 5 guys burgers and fries! 

Little (meaning 1 patty) bacon cheeseburger is the way to go! Their bacon is so crispy, just the way I like it! I get \"everything\" on it. This even includes grilled mushrooms and grilled onions. They carefully place each topping on and fold it in the foil with perfection. 

The fries are good although not my favorite. I like that the post where their potatoes come from up on the white board each day. One regular size order feeds 3 people!!! 

Peanuts to munch in while you wait. I love that. 

They also have those awesome high-tech touch screen soda machines that are sweeping the nation! 

Lacking that fifth star solely because of the price. For this family of 3, we spend no less than $25 in a single visit."}
{"text":"Easy and fast place to get a good burger!!  They have really good Cajun fries.  My kids 10, 13 and 16 love this place!"}
{"text":"Besides from the fact that they lift themselves up with signs that talk about how good they are, it's decent food. I think I've had a better burger in the time I've been on the planet. They have good fries but after eating entire bag it feels like I need to vomit, however they probably give you the most bang for your buck in that category. The prices are too high. But other than all the negatives I pointed out, it's pretty good. I'm going to come out and say it, I think I like fatburger more."}
{"text":"I really don't have much to say about the place. The burger was OK, the portion is pretty big. I like how the fries are just thrown in the bag lol. I can't say no to free peanuts. Decor was very retro-diner with newspaper clippings on the walls and typical diner music. I just wanted to try this place out since I've tried most burger joints in Toronto. I would only come back if I was craving a burger, and it was the closest place in the area, and I was too lazy to go to a farther & better burger place. Definitely not triple-D burger material."}
{"text":"The scenario: I'm hungry and in a shopping mall food court.  What do I do?  i've wanted to try this place and considered this to be the best option in the moment, especially now that Sushi House closed there recently.  

I only had a regular burger.  I asked for just lettuce and tomato, but a few pieces of raw onion found their way on there somehow.  I'm sure that's easy to do, and it turned out to be more of a pleasant surprise, actually.  No big deal.  I guess it's a good thing I actually do like onion, and for those times you're trapped in an airport or desperate enough to look for something to eat in a shopping mall food court, this is a decent burger with a nice choice of sides with no extra charge (whether you order them or not).  

Next time I find myself in this situation,  I'll just go 'All The Way' and expect to find the onion along with everything else they decide to throw on there.   As far as fast food goes, I'd say this is pretty good stuff.

(3 stars may be a slight overrating.  I'd give it 2 1/2 if that were an option, but it's not, so I rounded up until I can give this place another try)."}
{"text":"Great burgers & fries. A pleasant place to eat but it can be a bit on the noisy side between the volume of the music and if there is a decent sized crowd there. They do have an outside area foresting that is quieter."}
{"text":"Eh- it was just ok. I was told about the must-have Cajun fries, and they were just ok. Not spicy at all and appeared to be just like Cajun season salt sprinkled on regular fries. The fries were Kinda soggy and very greasy. Burger was ok. Tasted fresh, but I didn't know a \"regular\" burger was 2 patties. Yuck. 

Sadly- my favorite thing about this place was the fact they had Mello Yello. Sweet. 

It's good enough to eat- but it's no where near the quality of Chuckbox which is right up the street. Shoot- fatburger a stones throw away is better. 

Its good enough to eat again if your friends wanna go, but its not a place that i'll be craving or want to search for parking to eat at.

Oh well."}
{"text":"Great food though sometimes the fries are undercooked. Actually half the time I go there, which is very often, the fries are undercooked or have been sitting there for a while"}
{"text":"I come in here about once a month with my family, and today was that stop. Had great service with a smile. Can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"So i've been going to this five guys for the last seven months now, I always get a grill cheese veggie but now they're telling me that I can't make my grilled cheese veggie the way that I want because corporate won't allow it! Isn't that the whole point of having all the veggies that you can put on your burger and your grilled cheese made to how you want it? and now they're telling me that I'm not allowed to and if he's in a good mood that day maybe he'll make it what kind of bullshit is that??!! And apparently all the employees that new my order and were kind and helpful before this kid came in got \"let go\" cause they made and helped customers with their orders like good employees are supposed to do!!! I know your reading this cause I'm in the bar restaurant business and you don't treat your customers like that and make stuff up cause you just don't wanna do your job or you think My order is to much to deal with!!!
Oh and have a nice day!!!!!"}
{"text":"One star for the new manager, Antonio. This guy was telling me how to place the same order ive had for the past year. On top of giving me attitude, he entered my order wrong. 

The rest of the staff, especially Angel, is great and gets five stars. My colleagues and I will be going to another burger place if the new manager will be running this location. The old manager Joey made this place seem more welcoming and a place to relax during lunch."}
{"text":"I love my burgers! Always have this when I'm in the States, so I'm quite happy that this refreshing burger joint finally headed North. 

They don't have the best meat but the toppings are amazing! I always load them up. The fries are a must. Always get a large to share. Did mention the free peanuts!

Fav burger joint thus far!"}
{"text":"The price is definitely worth the product! It is the go-to place for a great burger in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Price have gone way up.   Quality still very lacking at this location.  They frequently get one or more aspects of our order wrong.   A sloppily run location."}
{"text":"I come here every Sunday on my lunch break and I never get sick of it! I love it here"}
{"text":"Day/Time: weeknight around 6pm

Atmosphere: gourmet fast food.  

Service: Friendlier than most.  It takes a while for them make your burger, 5-10 minutes.  There are free peanuts available (you help yourself).  If you are allergic to peanuts, you probably should not enter this restaurant.  I'm surprise that with all the \"nut-free\" products, and given the number of people with peanut allergies, they still serve peanuts. 

Food: ordered the hamburger.  Its pretty large (2 small patties).  The selection of toppings is 'gourmet'.  Its so-so, nothing special in my opinion.  I prefer Licks. Also  ordered the regular fries, it feeds at least 3 people (maybe up to 5 people).  Its way to large to share between two people.  These were similar to New York Fries.  Its free refills (self serve) for the soft drinks.

Value:  Pretty bad.  They do not offer a combo so if you order a burger/fries/drink, its like $15~.

I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"I love their burgers, you can get almost anything you want on it for no extra charge. I love the grilled mushrooms. My daughter rotates between the little burger and the hot dog, she loves both! The fries are big, a medium size will feed 2 people for sure, maybe three. They have a soda machine that gives you so many choices for beverages, almost too many! So the negative is that it is very expensive and when we were in there the other day, I noticed they raised their prices so now it is even more over priced. My daughter and I both get the little burger, share a medium fry and both get a regualr soda and with tax it is just under 20.00. I think that is alot of money for a fast food burger joint. The reason we go back is that we do love the food but it is not somewhere you can frequent if looking for fast food that fits the budget."}
{"text":"I hate five guys. However, this one @ Pittsburgh has changed my life view on Five Guys. It's sooo good. And the people are so nice! The jalepenos are HOT! the mushrooms and bbq sauce make it taste awesome! 

THE FRIES. I hate fries but I loved the fries here!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had since Byrons at the Honolulu International Airport. Big and juicy. The difference is the meat is never frozen. There are NO freezers in the joint. Just coolers. Handmade patties. Peanuts while you wait. Fresh potatoes daily for the fries."}
{"text":"Five Guys gets Five stars. Oh who they never disappoint.
Their fries are some of the best I've ever had. While I am a student on a budget, sometimes I cannot resist ordering a Little Fries from time to time. Fries portions may look really tiny, but don't order the next size up (especially if you want the smallest size). The fries are put into a cup, then put into a paper bag. - But wait, there's more: they scoop ANOTHER shovelful of fries into the bag. Yummmmmm

As for the main feature, the burger, they also deliver every time. Granted, I don't go too crazy with my patty, but even so, Five Guys knows how to make damn good burgers. For the price it is, I think it is totally worth it. 
The wait is never too long. I think that the staff have a good communication system going among themselves and they are incredibly efficient.

Bonus: They play great music in there! A lovely selection of upbeat rock n' roll classics plus some alternative stuff here and there. The music may not be for everyone, but to me it certainly sets the mood."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hub-bub is about.  Typical burger place.  I would have rated it a 4, but when I got my burger it was missing some of the ingredients/condiments I had requested and were actually on my receipt.  They forgot to add my grilled onions and grilled mushrooms.
What a pity! 
The burger itself was nothing out of this world, smaller than what I expected, but none the less, you can tell the meat was fresher than most burger joints.
The fries were good, although when I first got them I thought they overcooked them, but they did not taste burnt.  Not too many places have fresh cut fries like this place.
Not sure if I would come back.  Personally I think this place was WAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY overrated"}
{"text":"Will easily mess up your order and mess up the re-order as well. Might as well be okay with being surprised with the burger toppings you're given."}
{"text":"You're alright Five Guys!!

To many, I've probably evolved into a burger snob in some ways.  I'm always open to trying new burger places but after that one time, it will surely determine whether I would bother with that place again.

I think I will shamelessly plug my favorite burger place in Toronto until another one comes up and that's Burger's Priest (BP)  

With that being said, I do compare all the burgers I try to BP and none have come close but maybe, just maybe, Five Guys would be able to set me free?  I mean, if Obama loves it, shouldn't I? Yes we can! Right?....nahhh, No you can't..and you can take that to the bank!

But let me say this, it's a damn good burger and #2 on my list...though maybe a distant 2, but still at least I will grace the franchise with my presence again in the future.

D√©cor:
This is a franchise/fast food joint...and I expect nothing more or nothing less from it:  A place to order, and seats to sit on. Good job.

There are bags of potatoes in the front entrance with Five Guys branding though, so go ahead and take one.  Tell them Alvin said so or tell them you're one of the Five Guys.


Food:
A regular burger is two patties and a junior(a.k.a. sissy) is one.  You must order regular to really savour the tastes and honestly?...Screw the condiments unless they're vegetables.  Any sauce you use will mask the meat texture/taste.  See what I mean by snob?  Just an FYI, I still look like how I do in my picture...I don't possess a giant belly...even though I go burger crazy.

The painful truth of fast food revolves around how the food is presented.  In media, it looks fantastic, but in reality the burger looks pretty lousy with the bun being a bit mangled and squished. Priorities though, it's the taste that counts and Five Guys rocks at that.  The patty texture was similar to Burger's Priest where it slightly fell apart to melt in your mouth.  They're thinner patties which is why a regular burger (TWO!!!) is important.

Fries were adequate but nothing to phone home about. In fact, don't waste your stomach on them and just order two burgers!


Overall:
For a chain, this place is strong.  To be able to oust more exclusive places like Kraft or Gourmet Burger is an achievement in itself.
Give it a try and if you hear someone saying \"Man-up!\" to another guy friend who wants to order a sissy burger (single), or if you see someone try to take a bag of potatoes, it's probably me =)"}
{"text":"This is the type of service that every place should have.  My wife and I went here the second night they were open and the line was out the door.  We had our order taken within 10 minutes and I was completely impressed with the speed that they got our orders taken care of, attention to detail, and the fact that they got the order right.  The kids that were working here that night were busting their rears and not just standing around like other places.  I can only hope that they keep up the commitment to service and quality.

Oh, almost forgot, the burgers were OUTSTANDING!  Finally, Mentor has a good fast food burger joint with freshly made to ordre burgers."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Long lines and waits do not bother me because downtown we are all used to that. The burgers are not bad but I do have to say that In-n-Out blows thisplace out of the water! And by a long shot. The actual patty has minimal flavor. You have to hope the toppings are flavorful. The fries are ok but not spectacular. The only thing that was awesome to the fullest was the peanuts. but you can't mess them up!"}
{"text":"In honor of National Hamburger Day I thought I might take a moment to pay homage to one of my favorite (top two) fast food hamburger establishments, Five Guys.   If you haven't tried a burger from them you must, it is imperative you follow my recommendation.  Otherwise you quite possibly are depriving yourself of one of the greatest fast food experiences of your life (unless you are vegetarian of course!).  
Having moved here from Virginia where the OfG's (original Five Guys) originated it was quite depressing not having the little cheeseburger available here until about a year ago.  I tried the whole west coast In-N-Out thing and although close, just didn't do it for me.  Finally, being an avid follower on Facebook and seeing the franchise expand to places like Pittsfield, MA , Casper, WY and even Canada (eh) my taste bud prayers were answered and now we have five locations here in town.  
Let me share with you some fun facts about Five Guys:
*There are 250,000 possible ways to order a burger (although we all know I only order it one way-plain!)
* If you are in the mood for a Grape Fanta, Sprite and Orange Coke concoction all locations have a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine.  If I hadn't given up the coke I would be all over that.
* Everything is made fresh here.. they don't even have a freezer!
* If you are daring enough to order your burger \"all the way\" it is similar to the animal style but has mayo, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions, mushrooms, ketchup and mustard.. all for no additional charge!  It doesn't stop there though as they also offer such toppings as jalapenos, barbeque sauce, and green peppers... why anyone would want green peppers on such a delicious burger is boggling but to each their own.  
The food is super fresh and in fact there is a nice little notice advising you where the bags of potatoes for your fries have come from.   Speaking of the fries, if there was a negative about this place is would be that their fries are not my style.  I think they are too fresh and healthy for me but I still throw a few on my burger for texture purposes.  Even so you get more than enough for two people to share when ordering the regular size.
I interrupt this review for an important message.  If you are one of the 3.3 million Americans who suffer from peanut allergies, please do not enter Five Guys as not only are the fries cooked in peanut oil but they have bins and bins of complimentary peanuts for you to snack on while you wait.  It is an allergy attack waiting to happen!
With all that being said I think you should give them a try.  It is a little pricier than your usual fast food restaurants you may patronize but worth it.  And with that Yelp Nation in honor of NHD I leave you with this famous quote \"I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.\" Wimpy J. Wellington
PS- Mark your calendars National French Fry Day and National Hot Dog day are both coming up in July!"}
{"text":"I love five guys. I eat at the Las Vegas locations 1-2 times a week.  I was excited to find a Five Guys on Mill.

If you are looking for just a plain, simple burger and none of the fancy extras that high end burger joints offer, this is the spot.  A great tasting meat burger, no special or creative toppings to make the burger. 

I couldn't give it five stars overall, even though the burger was great.  My two knocks are; the store was dirty. I'm not referring to all the peanut shells on the floor (you can grab peanuts and eat them while you wait for your burger to be cooked). But almost all the tables were dirty. I actually had to clean my own table.  And the employee atmosphere was dead. The Las Vegas locations are rowdy and upbeat, full of energy the second you walk in. They greet you, they give orders  amongst themselves that is loud but upbeat.  That was missing from here at Mill Ave.

But don't let the small stuff that can be corrected overnight stop you from eating here.  What can't be fixed is their great tasting burger.  Add a milkshake machine and this joint will give In N Out a run for its money!  Plain and simple, Five Guys is a must try!"}
{"text":"WORST BURGER EVER!!!
I'd rather have a .99 burger from McDonalds. 
For $10ish I ordered a burger and little fries, no soft drink.

Blech. No flavor what-so-ever even though it was loaded with all sorts of stuff.

The bottom bun was soggy and turned to mush so it was impossible to pick it up and eat. I had to use a spoon. The beef was not seasoned at all and had ZERO flavor. The fries were fine. 

No... These guys don't know how to make a burger not to mention a pricy one.

No...no... no... never ever again. I was robbed!"}
{"text":"Decided to get some burgers for dinner, first off we get there and I realize it's a tad bit pricey. I mean 6$ for a \" little burger\" cmon I can get a whole meal at in n out for that price. As we're ordering the lady taking our order is cutting us off Everytime tying to move on to the next Order when I'm not even finished and she was very rude with no smile or anything. just tying to rush us. So I was not happy about that. THEN my mother orders a drink and the lady forgot to give us a cup so I politely asked if we can have our cup, she rudely says \" I thought I gave it to you\" I said no we haven't gotten one, she rolls her eyes and gives me a cup and just walks away. Don't know why her day was so bad but for me being a restaurant for 3+ years that was completely uncalled for....So we're waiting for our food and it took quite some time. I want to say we waited about 15-20 mins. We get home and I immediately realized that I did not just pay for 5$ worth of fries and get a half empty cup with soggy and wayyyy to salty fries! No matter how bad I drenched them I'm ketchup they were just wayyy to salty to eat. Yuck.  I even give my dog some fries every now and then and even she didn't eat them!!!! I go to eat my burger and I take a bite and realize it's a tad undercooked. I want to say not even 30 mins after finishing my meal I was in the bathroom for the rest of the night. I'm beyond upset I got food poisoning. And not only me but my fianc√© and mother as well. 
Let's just say we will never be returning to an overpriced place with horrible customer service. 
Horrible horrible horrible."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant!  Great service, very welcoming, welcoming you when you come in plus when you leave.  Be sure to get the free peanuts while you wait for your food. Wait time is approx 10 minutes.

Like the other reviews on here, they give you a lot of fries, small size is more than enough for 2 people.  Burgers are good too but keep in mind no chicken, only beef.

Place is busy and I love the atmosphere and the colours.  I love the music and it's oldies and rock and roll.  This place is great for older and younger people.

I really enjoyed going there this evening - wonderful experience.

I think it would be a good investment for a franchise opportunity as well.

Thank me later and go eat there if you haven't already.  Very filling and the food sits well with your stomach."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere,quick and happy service   good food. .can't beat the prices. .love the fries. .. love having the peanuts there.. over all a great little place for a burger and fun.."}
{"text":"So I was at this far away Five Guys because my wife was going to a birthday party and I was the chauffeur. It was not worth going home during her time at the party so I had to pass the time as well as have dinner and I ended up walking from the condo to where the party was at to here. I was too lazy to take the car and try to find a place in an area I was not familiar with.

One test of any hamburger is how does the patty taste by itself with nothing else on it. The answer is, drum roll please: it was bland.

I like all the toppings being included in the price, well besides cheese. I also liked free peanuts, Starbucks' next door wifi, and nobody bugging me about spending 2.5 hours here. What I did not like was the long wait - especially given the end product, the chaotic preparation I saw which I can see leading to errors, and the lack of a money-saving combo. To be fair, the patties were cooked (overcooked, since there was a lot of black searing?) fresh and the ingredients tasted that way too.

To compare, hero Burger tastes a little more processed but has a nicer flavour. The gold standard for me is the Fox and the Fiddle burger at Wellesley and Yonge. I have a monthly Skeptics meeting there and the combo is $10.99 but the patty is thick and so flavourful it could be eaten on its own. This was very far from that. It is better than Webers near Casino Rama which was the last burger I had. I enjoyed and liked but was not impressed by Five Guys. I would not go out my way to try it again.

I think a flavourful patty should be a high priority of any hamburger and if a place doesn't have that or is not that important to the restaurant, then I don't want to eat there, and it does not seem like it is a priority to this place. 

3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I took my 2 kids here on a Sunday as a quick lunch while shopping.  This place commits the cardinal sin of hamburgers; cooked well done to the point of being dry and tasteless.  Really?  The grease smell assaults you as you come in, but there's none in the burger?  Combine the mediocre meat with the overly salty, limp fries, the eating area stuffed with so many tables you can hardly walk, the crappy processed cheese slices and the $37 price tag and you have an unhappy customer.  

On the bright side, the peanuts are good and they give you a ton of food if that's what floats your boat.  For us, most of the fries ended up in the trash.

Meh."}
{"text":"If you're craving a burger, this is the place to come. Great service, great food, and super fast!! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Yes the place always needs the floor swept but when you give out  peanuts in the shell how won't it always be a bit dirty. 

The food speaks for itself, so good. Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. 

Getting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag."}
{"text":"This place gives you FREE peanuts!!! haha. It's kinda weird coming from a burger joint, but i'm not picky. For either burger, hotdog, or sandwich.. You get to pick what you want and take off what you hate. Plenty of toppings to choose from and they are actually fresh produce too. Either than lettuce and tomatoes, you can choose grilled mushrooms, jalapenos, grilled onions, and A1 sauce. Who does A1 sauce? 5 guys does :-{D. They french fries come in big portions and can feed 2-3 people, but the large can feed up to 3-5! Huge. It is kinda pricey but the quality is delicious. They also have the cool soda machine too where it looks like its from the future and it add extra flavor do any drink you want. Like vanilla, cherry, orange, raspberry, ect. Just try it."}
{"text":"So after a long drive to Hoover Dam and stopping in for some gambling at the M Resort, we decided to do some shopping at the Las Vegas Outlets South.  
We were also hungry and burgers sounded good.  I didn't want to eat at McDonald's or Wendy's or Burger King or any other chain that I can get anytime in Hawaii...I wanted to eat something different.  So when we saw the Five Guys Burgers located by the road next to the outlets, we decided to give them a try.
Overall, I'd rate the burgers as excellent and the fries as well.  The burger itself was excellent and cooked to perfection.  What I also liked was the fact that they include the toppings for free(except bacon, which you have to pay for)...so if you want mushrooms...no problem...onions...no problem...jalapenos...no problem.  
As an added bonus you can munch on free peanuts while you wait...it's serve yourself style...so scoop a bunch if you wish.  The peanuts are actually quite good.
Now for Hawaii people....Naw...it's not as good as Teddy's.  I still rate them higher."}
{"text":"The burger definitely lives up to the hype but the price doesn't.  They seem to pump the best $5 burger but my single was like $9.....I'm guessing the baby burgers are still pretty decent.  The decor is kind of weird with the red and white tile everywhere and the monster banners telling everyone how awesome they are.  I do like the peanuts while your waiting though....nice touch for sure.  Definitely a franchise I could get used to."}
{"text":"Five Guys is better than In-N-Out.  There, I said it.  Now, before I'm stoned by In-N-Out's rabid following, hear me out.

Five Guys makes a great burger (and cheeseburger, so I hear).  It's also a killer deal:  toppings, including grilled onions, sauteed mushrooms, ketchup, mustard, lettuce, pickles, jalapenos, bbq sauce, etc, are all free.  Yes, free.  It's almost unbelievable as most burger places in town charge for anything other than your basic tomato, lettuce, and onion.  Here, you can load up or go minimalist.  It's your choice.

Also, the burgers are massive.  Each sesame seed bun (advisory to those with tree nut allergies) is packed with giant, juicy beef patties.  I bit into my hamburger and literally said \"holy s*&t, this is delicious.\"   Everything tasted fresh and every ingredient was in proportion.  It really was hypeworthy. Please note, however, that a regular burger is enormous. So, if you're not in the mood to overeat to the point where you want to die (like I did), try the little hamburger that's also offered on the menu.

Now, the fries.  We ordered a regular-sized order of Cajun fries and they were...disappointing.  The thickness of the cut made them taste like three-hour-old steak fries.  They lacked crispiness and weren't hot, the essentials of a good fry.  So, In-N-Out wins that round.

Overall, I'd go back to Five Guys in a second.  Next time, however, I'd opt for the free peanuts (although, who knows what type of germs are in those peanut bins...I saw at least 6 5-year-olds put their hands in) over the fries."}
{"text":"Amazing !!! Had the best double cheese bacon mushroom lettuce wrapped burger ever !!  Sure it's pricey but it was heaven !!  If reading this review trust me you won't be disappointed ..... also gotta check out the best coke fountain drink machine .....just stop reading and see for yourself and say hi to me if you see me there because I'll be there again and again !!"}
{"text":"The quality of the ingredients is great and the burgers themselves are a great treat and that's what it is: a treat! 

The only problem I have is that the portions can be a bit too much for me and I end up not being able to even finish a cheese burger with little fries and just throwing them in the waste bin. 

I suggest going with a few friends and share the fries around, but other than the overly huge portions the food is worth the cost."}
{"text":"Five Guys is an absolutely amazing burger joint. Price is a bit high, but from my experience, you get a lot less at other places for the same price. I ordered a cheeseburger with everything on it or \"All the Way\" as they call it and it comes with mushrooms, grilled onions and the like. There are also a few more items you can order on it free of charge. It's the meat patty that I'm in love with. The burgers are juicy, hot, savory, and extremely delicious (and I LOVES me a cheeseburger). Five Guys are the best burgers I've had in Scottsdale so far and I will definitely be going back soon to break my diet."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while because of past bad experiences. First time I went there the burger/fries were decent. Next time the burger was good but the fries were gritty, as if they hadn't been washed properly before frying. Next time the fries were great but the burger was very greasy, like if the grill wasn't hot enough or needed cleaning. So I've been bypassing 5 Guys for a year or two, but after hiking the Metro Parks last Saturday I decided to give them another try.

No one was in line when I entered, but by the time I finished ordering there were about five people behind me, so lines form fast. Wait wasn't too long as my burger was custom prepared. I got the single patty cheeseburger ($4.99) plus small fries ($2.49). Approaching $7.50, I expected my meal to be a large step up over other fast burger joints. Sorry to say, it wasn't.

The fries were great. Hot, just enough salt, and just enough grease. But really, it's not that difficult to prepare great fries if starting with decent potatoes, a properly hot deep fryer and the proper cooking time. And for $2.49 they were not overpriced for the amount you get. If rating fries alone, they would get a very high score.

The burger was where I was disappointed. The meat was a step up over almost all other fast food burger places and that's a plus. (I refuse to eat at McD's or Ralley's because of the awful quality of the meat.) Patty was probably a third pound, and it would have been good if it hadn't been stretched out to fill a rather large bun. Flattening the meat allows it to be cooked faster but usually causes it to be overcooked. And mine was. Not juicy. No flavor. Tasteless. I like the extras available to choose from, but the beef should be the centerpiece of the burger. For the price, unless you are in a hurry or don't want to \"sit down,\" there are too many other good places to have a really good burger. Perhaps I'll try them again in a few years. Next time I am in the area and in need of food I will probably go across the street and, for less money, eat at Chipotle."}
{"text":"Immaculate burgers every time.  The meat is delicious, the fries are like no others, the service is fast and friendly, and you get to eat peanuts while you wait.  All the toppings you can think of can be put on your burger or dog for no extra charge and one order of fries satisfies 2-4 people.  They may not have a lot of variety, only making burgers and hot dogs, but they do it so well, you wouldn't ever care."}
{"text":"Went with friends, all had burgers and/or hot dogs. Juicy and delicious - not a crumb left by anyone. Unlimited free peanuts was a plus. In N Out Burger is across the street and we all agreed we'd come back here instead in the future. On top of the delicious food the entire place is just plain fun. Every single person working was fast, but having fun and making it fun for everyone too. We'll be regulars from now on for sure."}
{"text":"Let's see five guys are ok. I have had better and the high price for a meal certainly doesn't make it taste any better ,it only leaves you thinking \" I paid this much for this\"? All tho the free bag of nuts which I take home and roast a bit more is a nice lil touch to soften the blow of an expensive burger. I can say the fries are more impressive than the burgers. I don't like that the burger is served in foil and the buns look a bit beat. I like presentable food but I would suggest using a thinner foil to wrap the burgers in so the buns don't get overly crushed."}
{"text":"No doubt it's a good burger, but $20+ for me and the wife to eat burgers and fries?

Sure you can throw unlimited toppings on your burger, but once you get 2 or 3 on there all you are accomplishing is creating a burger that you can't fit in your mouth. The hero of a great burger is the meat, right? You start tossing around multiple toppings all willy-nilly you end up with a burger that might have had a nice juicy patty of wonderful beefy goodness in there somewhere, you just can't remeber anymore.

The large order of fries is definately large and enough to feed Kate, plus her eight, plus her douche-bag ex and still have some to take home. And while the cajun fries are tasty, they get a little old by the end of the bag.

I am sure this sounds like a negative review, I promise, it's not. Just honest. I will be back. It's a good burger. I will refrain from comparing it to In-N-Out; apples and oranges as far as I am concerned. But I will say that if I am torn between 5 guys or In-N-Out, an animal style double double will win out every time."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, great service!  Even saw them support the community and the Girl Scouts! Awesome food and staff! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Good burgers but I don't get what the big deal is. All the hype and I was just like hmmmm it's good but the price is a little heavy."}
{"text":"Great burgers with all the toppings you could want, good fries, complimentary peanuts and the best soda machine ever!!!  It's like In & Out on steroids."}
{"text":"Opening up a burger joint with 4 of your best friends and having it turn into a huge success is the dream right?  Well, in this particular situation, it was the 4 Murrell brothers (I'm not sure how that translates into 5 guys), and once you try their burgers, you can see why they are now a successful North American franchise.
This is the second time I have had 5 Guys Burger and the food was as good as I remember the first time.
To start, when you enter the establishment, you line up to place your order.  I had the bacon cheeseburger along with an order of cajun fries and a soft drink.  Once you order, you can grab yourself some peanuts (in the shell), have a seat and enjoy your nuts while your order is prepared.
All the burgers are prepared fresh once your order has been placed.  There is a variety of condiments from which to choose including things such as grilled mushrooms and grilled onions.
It takes approximately 5-10 minutes for your burger to be made and they certainly provide you with an abundance of fries (one order of regular fries should be adequate for two people).
Overall, the burger was excellent!  I had mine with lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles, and A1 steak sauce.  The burger patties (most burgers come with two patties) were not very fatty, but rather on the lean side, however they were quite flavourful.  Condiments were fresh.  My one gripe is that they use processed cheese slices and I would have preferred a less processed cheese.  Overall, a great burger.
Once again, the fries were plentiful and the cajun seasoning was somewhat spicy but not overly powerful.
Service was very friendly and efficient.
When it comes to price, the overall cost was more than I would have expected to pay for this type of meal.  For my wife and I to have two bacon cheeseburgers, one order of regular fries to share, and a soft drink cost $28 which is somewhat pricey for a meal of burgers and fries. 
Nevertheless, the food was good and I would say it is definitely worth giving 5 Guys Burger a try, however, the burger marketplace is a competitive space with numerous excellent burger joints such as Burger's Priest, Holy Chuck Burger, Big Smoke Burger etc, all of which serve excellent burgers. So, take your pick and enjoy your burger journey."}
{"text":"Got there before noon, so the place was empty. By 1pm people were very loud and others were waiting in line. I got a burger, large fries and coke for $16.50.  My buddy got a little hamburger and coke for $8. We got free refills of pop.  Thee were two rows of toppings to get one in black and one in red.  Make sure you look at both of the because I didnt.  

The fries were massive yet perfect, and I ate every morelsel. The coke was, well, a coke. But the double burgers, man were they sweet. Especially in the middle I caught mustard and jalape√±os. Basically it was heaven on a plate. With free peanuts we left very full and very happy.

If I had to say one thing it's that it costs $16.50, which is like a steak or pork chop platter

TL:DR the burgers were well worth the $24 and if you are too poor for that then A) you are too cheap, or B) you don't really eat burgers."}
{"text":"Good food nice service but very disappointing to find hair melted in the cheese with my burger."}
{"text":"I have no idea what the buzz is about unless they hired a good PR agency. The burgers are as average as possible which makes the place over priced. Try Smashburger or Lucky Boy if you want a really great burger."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever - the staff is so upbeat - I love when employees are having fun and enjoy their jobs - I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Stop fucking yelling at me! I already over payed for your mediocre burger.....could've gone to In N Out and been treated like an adult! Next to the singing at Johnny Rockets.....the worst business idea ever!"}
{"text":"Five Guys is a great backyard burger.  I would compare it to something my family would bbq up during the summer months.  The down side is that it always seems to fall apart and the hamburger patty and bun NEVER seem to finish together.  The last few bites are usually the bun with toppings.

The Cajun fries are yummy.  A regular size feeds 3-4 people easily.

The soda machine is really cool.  If anything, stop in just for that."}
{"text":"Besides the usual great food, they played Peter Gabriel era Genesis \"Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\" on sound system.  Probably over 35 years since I heard that over the airwaves."}
{"text":"Good burgers for a good price and the french potatoes are huge and delicious ! Thanks guys :)"}
{"text":"Went to the new Paradise Valley location. Very greasy as mentioned. Hamburger completely fell apart after one bite. Fairly flavorless. Fries were so salty I returned them for a no-salt version. And its expensive for what you get. In-n-out is a mile away and that is better value. Toppings don't make up for the price or the taste."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong at five guys. Double cheese burger with saut√©ed unions and a1 sauce, and Cajun fries."}
{"text":"I'm a computer science student at U of I assisting in research and developing software applications this summer. I don't currently have much money to play with, but I still find it economical to grab some food while running urgent errands. I was taking care of dentist and auto paperwork on Prospect Avenue yesterday and decided to visit the Five Guys restaurant across the street from the car shop for lunch. 

Yesterday, I had a nearly perfect experience. It started when I asked a few strangers at the car shop if the restaurant across the street was worthwhile. They said yes. I could tell walking in that I was going to get quality food because the restaurant had a quality appearance. The menu instantly reminded me of the late crepe delicious restaurant in the campus union which had superior food quality for a consistent price. The manager answered my questions about the restaurant and its history and why there are bags of potatoes in middle of the seating area and if the peanuts were free. I filled up on a delicious burger and was asked how it was when I was finished. It was excellent. I was determined to be a loyal customer at this point in time.

There were few details about the visit. The potatoes in the seating area are an awesome idea. I think it's a great way to display to everyone that the fries are made in store not to mention organic and fresh. Not every single employee was on par right away with the restaurant beginnings history, but I still was able to learn it. I loved how I could choose my exact topping combination without changing the burger price. However, I didn't find out until the next day that the jalape√±os could be fried or grilled. I did mention that there should be a free sign next to the peanuts to give courage to the customers to grab some for themselves. I was told this was not needed. I'm not sure if that is necessary, but I personally felt the need to ask if the peanuts were free. This was alright with me since I felt talkative, but in general, customers should not have to feel awkward or pressured in any way. There was some construction going on in the ceiling, but it didn't seem to intrude and there weren't many customers in at the time. The biggest problem I saw, however, was a table set up right inside the front entrance.

Today, I was in the same car shop again in the early afternoon considering lunch. I decided that I would return to the Five Guys restaurant across the street since I had such a great experience in my previous visit. I noticed the table still in front of the door, but I didn't say anything about it during my visit. I was greeted and recognized instantly from my previous visit and felt warmly welcomed. I asked to try something different and was recommended the beef hot dog. I ordered an all out beef cheese and bacon hot dog with some spicy grilled jalape√±os and mushrooms. I specifically ordered it with no mayonnaise. There were a lot more customers and the management responded when I commented on this that the week starts getting busy on Wednesdays. I sat down, opened my hot dog, right away I saw a problem. There was a ugly white substance which I have no taste for on my lettuce. I brought it to the food-out counter and inquired about it. It was mayonnaise, even though my receipt says no mayonnaise. The first response I got was an excuse. The age old, \"we have a newly trained employee\" reaction. Now I understand mistakes happen. We are all human here, but how a mistake is handled is even more important than trying to keep everything correct in the first place. This is what makes or breaks the customer experience. The employee did the right thing by rejecting the food even when I offered for her to fix it and give it back. She did apologize for the mistake. She insisted on making me an entirely new hot dog which I didn't have to wait too long for. I couldn't hear what the employees were talking about after this. I could only hope they weren't talking about me being silly for enforcing my standards as a customer. I didn't like sitting on the fence with reading their attitudes about the situation. I sat down at my table, knowing what I wanted from the staff, unsure if they would meet my expectations or lose my five star judgement.

The answer came to my table for me. The engaging manager, who treated me how a customer should be treated, brought my lunch directly to me like a waitress at a sit down. She brought with her a side of spiced fries in attempt to make up for the mistake and ensure that I felt cared for. I'm not going to say this became a five star experience because of the corrected mistake. Yesterday was a five star experience, and today, while coming close to losing it, still maintained its five star level. Five Guys team, give credit to your perky optimistic manager and employees' vigilance for your five star rating and for protecting your reputation. I will definitely come back to visit when possible. Please move the table away from the entrance."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and the fries and shakes aren't bad either. The price is pretty outrageous though. $17 for a bacon double cheese, reg fries and and reg shake. In-Out is just as good but a better deal."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I hadn't heard of 5guys before Obama hailed them as his favorite burger. Nonetheless, I was impressed. Great location, plenty of seating and an efficient process. 

I ordered the \"little\" burger and let me assure you, this is plenty big! A really good size burger with your choice of toppings. I got all the standards, minus the onions. Shared a regular fries with a coworker and there were still left overs. Really enough fries for three ppl. I really enjoyed my meal here, and they get kudos for great drink selections (sprite zero anyone?!?) 

Oh, and they have all you can eat free peanuts too!"}
{"text":"The burger is decent, but there are better options for good burgers.  Takes them awhile to make the burger.  If the place was busy then I would understand, but its not."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys! I recently moved from NY to the Charlotte area and have always been a fan.  This location did not disappoint!  As a person with gluten sensitivity, Five Guys is very knowledgeable about gluten intolerances.  They're fries are gluten free, which is always a treat.  They also offer their burgers bun-less or on lettuce wraps, so I never feel like I have to skimp to get a good burger.  I would highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"If you like soggy fries and tasteless beef patty regardless of condiments. This is for you. My two cents: stick to steak and shake or whatever your regular joint is. We crossed the street to L&L to finish dinner.  I will post the picture of the soggy fries. You can see my order clearly say \"no pickles\" on all the burgers but they were packed with pickles. Size is bigger than your standard size, so down size your order. That was no biggie. One star: Staff was nice. Over rated and priced food. Wasted calories and money."}
{"text":"There is a food safety issue, I just don't understand about many restaurants like five guys, pandora bread, and so on in Toronto.  We can see you, so you hand washing and food prep techniques should be superb.  The manager wore the same pair of gloves to make and prepare my food, empty the fry bucket and who knows what else; in the back of the restaurant.  At all the five guys on York mills, Warden, and laird have these loud, crass, females working there who are more interested in gossip, than there jobs.  It's the managers issue for not hiring the right team members.  Also, when the manager is a bad employee himself; he will , most likely, hire the type of staff that mirror his style.  The one on laird, is ran,seemingly, by a child.  There has been a fast turn around on staff.  I've only been there three times this year and someone is always being trained.  I use to come often last year before the new manager arrived.  I don't know if it was sold, but It has a very different atmosphere.  ( not good)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the burger tour a couple of my friends are taking and their burger to date is the greatest restaurant burger I have tasted.  I ordered the Junior cheese with bacon and loaded it with my favorite toppings and it was amazing.  Almost tasted like I made it myself at home on the grill.  I also had their Cajun fries which were also delicious, and of course I had some shelled peanuts (which are complimentary) while waiting for my meal to be cooked.  This is by far the greatest burger restaurant I have been to and I plan on going back again in the near future.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is seeking a serious tasty burger."}
{"text":"Walking down state street I was looking for the sign as I didnt know the exact address. I finally spotted it as its hard to miss. A big red and white sign that says FIVE GUYS. As I was about to walk in, two guys walked by and one sais to the other, \"I was just in there a few days ago and its amazing!\" I thought to myself, \"I'm just about to see\". The interior was all red and white also. They were playing 80's classic rock and I think it was off a local radio station. I walked right up to the counter where there was no wait. I ordered the double with cheese ,bacon, fried onions and mushrooms without any condiments, smaller order of fries and smaller drink. Came to $9.57, yikes! Counter dude yell my order to dudes waiting to cook and there were about 7 of them working the grill and fryers. The burger was tender and juicy, and I enjoyed. The fries were way more than I can finish and the smaller size can easily be shared. They were fresh cut from idaho potatoes and cooked in peanut oil and I could distinctly taste the peanut oil. These were like the home made fries we had growing up. I liked them and they were different from everyones. I will be back here....."}

I used to work in fast food and this is how I was trained-make no one wait!!! I love the soda pop machine!!! So cool!! THe peanuts keep my kids busy as we wait for our order and when we get our food-it's soooooo good. Top notch. Love it!!!! The restaurant is clean and I've seen workers out in the seating area attending to it, which is a plus as well! Attention to detail and great service, you can't beat it!!!! I love all the options for toppings you can get on your order too!!"}
{"text":"Best French fries around!!! Fresh cut and always hot and crispy, is go here just for the fries!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger joint. I got the cheeseburger All the Way, their way of ordering everything on it. It had a double patty too which surprised me so its very filling. And fresh cut fries were delicious. Even the regular size gives you a giant portion of fries. Definitely enough to share.  I came at noon on a Saturday in December so it was packed but I still only waited about 15 minutes from the time I walked in. Highly recommend Five Guys. I'm sure I'll be back quite often."}

{"text":"Me & the Mister went here for lunch this afternoon; we'd never been here before.  He wanted a good burger (which he only gets a hankering for every couple months or so...) and although I wasn't in the mood for something that heavy, I was open since I usually pick the place.

He ordered a cheeseburger w/ everything hold the ketchup; I had the bacon cheeseburger - hold the mayo & fungus (mushrooms) and we shared a regular fry.  He finished his on the spot I had to take mine home.  He said it was messy but good.  I said good burgers are supposed to be messy IMHO.

The fresh, yet greasy fries in the bottom of the bag took me back in time to my days of taking AmTrak w/ my Moms from Penn Station in NY to Union Station in Chicago to visit my grandmother - Moms would always pack some various foods that some would wind up soaking through the bags; but I digress...

The total for this meal plus 2 soda's = about $21.  I would venture back, but it may be awhile.

...I'm still stuffed I really don't think I'll need dinner tonight."}
{"text":"We heard so many good things about this place so we finally checked it out.  It was lot's of fun and we liked it a lot.  Not just the food but the whole concept, the look and feel.  It reminds us of something good that maybe we don't find so much anymore."}
{"text":"As a local Californian, I'd been hearing rumblings for quite some time that there was a new game in town-- that my beloved In-N-Out had competition in the form of Five Guys.  Well, I finally gave Five Guys a shot when we went out to Vegas a few months ago.  

There is no comparison to In-N-Out.  None.  (Other than maybe the color scheme).  

In-N-Out wins, 10 hands down.  (That's all of the hands of each of the 5 guys.)  

I will give Five Guys credit for excellent customer service.  Employees are attentive and walk around to check up on whether you need anything.  

The soda machine is the best.  It's like a video game.  You can concoct thousands of different soda combinations. (Pick your \"base soda\" of Sprite/Diet Sprite/Coke/Diet Coke/Root Beer etc. and then add flavors orange/lemon/lime/strawberry/peach etc.)

As for the burger, it is no In-N-Out burger,  The burger here was just \"OK\" for me.  It tasted more like a Whopper, if I had to compare it to another chain restaurant burger, and I didn't care for it at all.  The bun got kind of soggy.  There are quite a few topping options, to customize your burger.  My husband enjoyed getting jalapenos on his burger.   

The free peanuts were a nice touch.  It's nice to nom nom on them while you wait for your food.

I'm glad I went, so I could finally put to rest my curiosity about this place.  I won't rule this place out for a return visit, but it won't be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"I had never eaten at a \"five guys\". However, I'd gotten numerous recommendations from friends. Outstanding burger, very tasty, fresh buns, great condiments. The fries were also outstanding. I'll be going back to Five Guys!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today at noon and waited more than 20 minutes for a cheeseburger and fries. I wasted my entire lunch break just waiting. Every thing was super greasy and oily. The fries were dumping out all over the bag and they were terrible. I didn't eat more than one and it was soaked with old frying grease. They were not edible. Also I finished about half the burger before I lost my appetite. They slopped so much mayo it was gross and the bun was all smashed and greasy. I paid over $10 for this nasty bag of crap. I will never come back."}
{"text":"Soggy french fries, an okay burger and that's about it. Oh, and it will cost about 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's alright. I really like the addition of the milkshakes (fucking finally). While its a good idea, I think Five Guys can certainly come up with more new and innovative additions to a pretty cut and dry menu. Loved the strawberry shake I other day.

And fuck the asshole armored van people that block you in, and the driver just sitting there on his phone who can't pull up 4 feet to let people out. Really?"}
{"text":"Great burger-they never skimp on the fries and the buns are never stale.
I could do without the dine in however, it's usually too busy to sit down and enjoy a meal. I just take it home.

You can pay a lot more at other boutique burger joints (Coal Burger leaps to mind), and get a lot lesser of a product."}
{"text":"Great burgers. I really just stick with the basic cheeseburger with bacon but they are really good. I recommend ordering online. Much faster.
A little pricey. It adds up fast but it is a nice treat."}
{"text":"I really like their food, but their prices are way too high. Seriously, $11.50 for a hamburger and a regular drink? Probably won't go back again"}
{"text":"Most burgers come with 2 patties. So be ready to be stuffed.  Order small fries cause they give you lots of extra in the bag. Alwsys order mine \"all the way\" cause the toppings are so good. Expensive but worth the treat."}
{"text":"Love the service, love the food , the originality of the burgers ... I asked for thousand island dressing and one of the workers just made me some from scratch right then and there. ..one of my favorite burger joints when I want to treat myself to a damn good burger."}
{"text":"Five Guys is the place to go when you want a good burger and fries fast. The menu is very simple - burgers and fries.

The burger: always cooked well done, but still juicy. Pick as many toppings as you want, but don't miss the grilled onions and mushrooms. Very flavorful, always satisfying.

The fries: #3 fries in Cleveland, behind Lola and Bar Cento (which is good company!). Idaho potatoes cut and fried right on site. Somewhere between shoestrings and chips in width, these are fantastic. Just crispy enough, and vinegar is available for those who really know how to enjoy a fry.

While I have never had them, there are also hot dogs, grilled cheeses, and a veggie sandwich (not a veggie burger - a veggie sandwich). 

A few things for the first-timer: A \"cheeseburger\" is really a double cheeseburger - ordering a  \"Little Cheeseburger\" is probably what you're expecting when you order the former. (No one is going to go hungry on a little burger!) The same goes with french fries - two people can easily share a regular fry. I repeat: two people can easily share a regular fry. The only reason to order a large fry is to server 3-4 people.

Without the information above, one could easily conclude that Five Guys is overpriced by ordering (for two people) two \"cheeseburgers\" and two \"regular fries.\" This will get you enough food for four people, and will set you back $24. The key to recession friendly-eating at Five Guys is splitting - get a cheeseburger (which is a double!) and a regular fry. Between the satisfying stack of toppings on the burger, the big bag of fries and all-you-can-eat shell-your-own peanuts, you'll do just fine. Between this menu confusion and the lack of a veggie burger (or organic/grass-fed/free-range/douche-bag patties), I'm setting them back a star. 

For the legal team: Everything is gluten free (except the bun), there is no trans fat, they use peanut oil for the fries, Five Guys may be addicting."}
{"text":"I live in Mooresville right next to a 5 Guys but choose to make the drive to this one in Huntersville because it is so good.  It is always clean and the food is always great.  It just tastes better than other 5 Guys.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm due for another, yet just a cup of Cajun fries would suffice.... Yikes my burger was buried!"}
{"text":"How hard is it to get two burgers right? Staff was too busy chatting with each other. My tomatoes went on my wife's burger while her onions went on mine. Ticket was correct, assembly was wrong."}
{"text":"There is nothing I love more than a good burger, plain and simple, the way God and America intended it to be, and Five Guys delivers. With the new, trendy \"gourmet\" burger trend sweeping through Scottsdale, a plain old burger was just what the doctor ordered to get me out of my \"goat cheese and grilled pineapple with arugula\" burger rut. Went today with a pal during lunch time and holy moley, it was CROWDED! You wonder where everyone in Arizona is in the summer? At Five Guys, sheesh! My pal insisted I order the \"little burger\"... and even though I told her I was ravenous, she said, \"no, you want the LITTLE burger\". Expecting a slider sized burger, I was surprised to see it was completely normal sized, maybe even a bit bigged than an In and Out. I was also pleasently surprised because they say their burgers are \"well-done and juicy\". I myself, like my burgers still moo-ing. Well, I could barely tell they were well done, and Holy Mary, it was the juiciest burger I had ever had! The fries were hot, fresh, and still had the potato skin on, amazing. It is a little on the pricey side. I should have ordered the small fries, but like I said, I was starving, and ordered the big ones. My friend had a hot dog and it looked pretty good. My fave thing: endless topping INCLUDED! Wahooooo! It is definetly a great place to check out, maybe next time I will just get take out, cause it was a bit crowded. I did love the old fashioned feel, with the potato sacks everywhere and the open kitchen with fry cooks chettering away in their crazy kitchen jargon. Being from Chicago, a lot of places have open kitchens and to me, it is a fun thing to watch the interection and the burger flipping. Great place, go, and you will be happy to have a good, plain, old fashioned BURGER!!! NO GOAT CHEESE, YAY!!!"}
{"text":"This Five Guys is the real thing. I ordered online, showed up, introduced myself to the friendly and charismatic cashier, waited for a few minutes (they always make your fries fresh, so a brief wait is inevitable), and was offered some water while I waited (in Las Vegas, any offering of water is always appreciated!), and had my order delivered in a timely fashion. I love Five Guys and this particular store did not disappoint me."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys. I feel like we've built this relationship of human and food that's honestly quite close to true love. 

Let's start with the location. I wouldn't say it's 'conveniently' located, but I'm not complaining. It's apart of a fairly large plaza with a few other meaningless stores pertaining to a healthy lifestyle for the wealthy. The area itself seems pretty posh. 

Parking is kinda messy depending on time of day, I typically come around 2:30PM-3PMish on a weekday and it's not bad, I did come to the restaurant around 8PM once and the place was jam packed, both parking lot and restaurant. Clearly a peak time.

I've never waited longer than ten minutes to get my food, and sometimes it's less than that. My favourite part is, they give you extra fries! Which in my opinion, is a beautiful thing. The beef is PRIME. It's fantastic, the fact that it's cooked to perfection and fresh every time is one of the main reasons I've phased out McDonald's, Burger King and basically any other fast food establishment you can think of from my diet. The stuff they call meat at McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Harvey's, etc etc...is just not quality, or worth my money

The cheeseburger is my fave to get here, just the regular burger is also fantastic if you just want to enjoy the sweet delicious beef but, sometimes you just wanna devour some cheesy beefy goodness. I haven't tried bacon to be honest, I prefer simple condiments and bacon kinda seems like a condiment, not something you'd usually add but sometimes you're just feeling it

I'm lucky enough to live close by. Five Guys has changed the game of fast food, in my opinion. I'll continue to spend my money at this establishment."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but just wasn't impressed at all. Was here Sunday, Jan 3, about 11:45 am, and the young man that took our order had absolutely no interest in his job. Didn't greet us as we went to the ordering station. I even mentioned this was our first time here and he made no response at all! I do need to say though there was another worker in the lobby cleaning tables and he  was super friendly, which delighted us after the stone face at the counter! My daughter and I each ordered the little cheeseburgers fully loaded. I guess fully loaded is what made the bun  a soggy mess. The burger itself was tasty and very big, but we couldn't get past the falling apart soggy bun. Also we ordered a large Cajun fry to split which was way too much ( Mr personality failed to mention this to us) they were fairly good, but a little too salty. Also surprised this burger place doesn't serve milk shakes- we did ask. 
Think we will keep searching for a great burger place because this isn't it for us."}
{"text":"My wife summed it best: \"This tastes like a Costco burger\". Translation: go to Costco, buy some buns, some frozen patties. Grill the patties, add cheese, favorite toppings, and you have a burger that tastes like a Five Guys burger. Nothing special.

To the more faithful, I'll be deemed a heretic. But I was told that Five Guys was \"better than In-n-Out\". I go to In-N-Out at least once a week. I own 2 t-shirts. I love In-N-Out. But I'm not so religious that I'm unwilling to try another burger that could be better. I went to delux burger, and was rewarded with a innovative, great tasting burger.. I was hoping Five Guys would give me that same experience.

Nope. Not even close. Five Guys is not as good as In-N-Out, and it's more expensive. The fries are good, thick cut, seasoned and fried right, great with ketchup. But the burger was average. The bread tasted manufactured, the toppings generic. The tables are cramped, squeezed close together.  Eating as a family of 5, I had to put my bag of fries on the floor: no space left on the table. Chairs and people stick out the narrow aisles between tables make getting a refill a dangerous mission . No drive thru to bypass inside. Not my kind of place.

Sorry Five Guy's, I'm sticking with In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Same good five guys burgers. Quality and consistent food for a decent price. Not much else to say....

**Update** The parking lot where Five Guys is located is terrible. I head over there because I want a burger but end up leaving without one because the parking lot is so cramped, this happens a lot. You have to go during slow hours to get in there."}
{"text":"Worst service! Called in my order ahead of time, arrived, burgers are sitting their ready but no fries, had to wait another 20 minutes for them to cook the fries! There's a reason I called in the order, offered no apology or anything. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I'd like to echo the comments by Scott P below. with one update...

Small burger, Small fry, Small drink now = $14"}
{"text":"Back story of Five Guys - originally started as a family business in Washington, DC in '86. Father and 4 sons are the Five guys of the Five Guys Burger and Fries. Quite simply the company's aim is to serve fresh hamburgers and french fries. The restaurant's popularity grew and heralded great acclaim in the media. Although there hasn't been much coverage in the GTA there's currently 800 restaurants open in North America. In Ontario there's about 10 restaurants open so far.

This Woodbridge location has been around for about year but I only came across it today. It's tucked in a corner unit of a plaza on Weston Rd and Hwy 7.

The look of the restaurant is straight forward featuring an open kitchen, a long counter to order and pickup, red and white checkered pattern color theme. There's stacks of potatoes on the floor and open boxes of complimentary peanuts to snack on. Obviously don't come here if you have a peanut allergy :O  They use peanut oil to cook their fries. The dining area is ample and on that Sunday afternoon when we were there it appears to be a popular spot for families to gather. 

Ordering:

Feeling daring, I ordered the Cheese Burger (2 patties) and Tamara got a little burger. little = 1 patty, 1 small fries and a drink. Toppings are pretty standard affair, nothing out of the ordinary however there is a notable inclusion of grilled onions and mushrooms. Yeah! 

Everything was made fresh to order. I unwrapped this ridiculous beef tower and sunk my teeth into it: 

My impression:

Good flat top fresh ground patty. It contains no additives or seasoning. Made from fresh Canadian beef and pressed each morning according to the manager. The American cheese in my cheese burger oozed out from every which way due to the heat of my burger patties. Although messy to eat the cheese complimented the burger providing a bit more needed taste. The sesame bun was thick but kept it all together. Overall the burger was alright but it wasn't very tasty. 

The small order of fries, which in my opinion is an extra large were simply THE BEST FRIES I've ever had!  They are made from whole Canadian potatoes and cooked in peanut oil.

The manager and staff were very friendly and hospitable. The manager personally came over to our table to talk with us, checking how everything was and giving us a little history and information on the company. 

In summary:

It's cost is higher compared to other fast food burger chains however everything here is king kong sized. The highlight for me were the fries and the unlimited drinks refills. 

It's worth trying though if you hadn't been.  

Recommend!"}
{"text":"For the price, definitely not worth it. Felt like in and out burgers with nothing special and jacked up prices. Did I mention the jacked up prices? At least hero burgers and their ilk give you thick patties with really good toppings. This felt like you went to a friend's place--and not a really good friend--and he tried to feed you his burger grilled from his grill, with burgers with thin patties from a no name brand. Nothing wrong with no name brands. But then that friend tried to ask you for money for each burger and then offered you free peanuts for the stupid price. Then told you drinks and fries were extra and only the fries were good.

Staff was friendly, though. That much I can say."}
{"text":"This 5 guys location is always consistent, the service is friendly and fast, and the portions are huge. The regular hamburger is actually 2 patties! The baby burger, I would consider a \"regular burger\" which is more than enough for the average person. The burgers are always cooked properly,  there is a wide variety of fresh toppings and everything is made to order.  I don't mind waiting, because at least I know what I am getting is fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, friendly staff, quick service. Love the Cajun fries! One suggestion, your fries are awesome with ranch, but you don't carry ranch, just an idea ;)."}
{"text":"they give us the fries in a brown paper bag with the burgers in it too and the fries looked over cooked. First time there and I'm disappointed, saw a bunch of publicity on the walls about their fries saying they were really good but all the quotes were from 10 years ago or more. The burger wasn't as bad as those fries tho."}
{"text":"Food is very good, I would recommend it, but the prices seem high for just burgers and fries, no matter how good they are."}
{"text":"The price is overly expensive for a fast food joint.  A burger, fries and drink will run you about $15. I found the fries to be bland and burned.  The burger was also bland even though I got a bacon double cheeseburger. It also takes a while to make it so if you're in a rush it's not the best place to go."}
{"text":"Service and staff were exceptional! We were greeted by almost everyone, thanked and welcomed. And the food!! The fries serving was huge! (We opted to share a large order of fries between 2-way too much food) we also ordered the little bacon cheeseburgers and were very satisfied with the portion. I can't imagine what the \"normal\" size should be. Come hungry and leave satisfied!

Was it better than In N Out? Meh, as a Cali native that's hard to say exactly, but I was not disappointed by the speed of service and quality of the food."}
{"text":"Excellent food here at this Five Guys in Peoria!  I love the burgers, the french fries are yummy and there are lots of them, and the drink machine is fun fun fun!  Best of all is that I find the service both friendly and efficient.
The food is hot and it is only a 2 or 3 minute wait.  Yes Yes Yes this is a burger place and not a high-end restaurant but for the money the food is a great value.  I have been to dozens of other places for burgers but this is my favorite.  Wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"My family and I love five guys, however even tho this is the closest to my home, the past year  when  we  craved  five guys  we made the effort to drive further to a different location because of prior experiences.
I can tell you this, the atmosphere with the workers is definitely a better one and the management definitely took care of me with the given situation.
Over a year ago, on two separate occasions they had messed my order up. First time I ordered in person, when I paid my orders were correct on screen, but when placed in the bags, the stickers on the burgers did not match the tickets outside the bag, and unfortunately, with hungry children, they just start grabbing & eating whatever they thought was theirs. The second time the order was placed online, I had to wait 30 minutes for pick up, that was fine we had at least 6 burgers  again, when I got there of course it wasn't ready, and management didn't do anything to acknowledge that. I ended up waiting another 30 minutes, even tho I told them to make sure the burgers are marked correctly, the same issue happened. thank God that manager is no longer there. I complained on the website & the district manager responded & offered to replace a third of the meal. I love the burgers, but not enough to experience the same customer service hence the reason for not returning.
 Most  places  only  honor  offers  like these  for a  limited  time. I  explained  to situation  to  the new  manager &  he  understood  and  made  sure  we  were  taken  care  of and  he  did  just that.  finally  no  more  in &  out  for  us  when we  want good  burgers =)"}
{"text":"Awesome, just fabulous awesome! Getting hungry while I write this. :)

Location is great, just a few minutes drive from the strip.

Staff very friendly and explained very informative on how to order and what was on the different burgers.

The burgers... Juciy, fresh meat, great bread, and tasty add-ons. 

The fries.. cut and cooked at the restaurant.. Just super fabulous!

We were on a 3 week road trip in the US and ate a loot of burgers, these ones were by far the best!

Recommend very much! So, are you close by? Reading this? Off you go right now to Five Guys! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have ever had.  I think better than big Smoke.  Name kind of sucks.  Place looks clean but did not check the washroom.  Fries are about a 2-3 star.  I gotta check The Priest."}
{"text":"The Good:

-People working behind the counter are enthusiastic.
-Tons of extra fries thrown in the bag.  Not overly salted, but could use a little bit more crunch.
-The food isn't bad.  Burger tastes fresh.

The Bad / Meh:

-The music was cranked up way too loud.  Seems like a set of speakers need to be installed in the kitchen so it doesn't have to be cranked up for the workers to hear it.

-The burgers aren't anything to write home about.  The bun tastes like a regular bun you can get anywhere, the meat patty could use some extra seasoning.  The cheese is plain-old American cheese.

-The price.  While the price isn't outrageous, $13 for a burger and fries that aren't really \"high end\" is a bit much.  (It's regular beef it's nothing special like organic / grass fed / whatever).

The Bottom Line:

I normally don't eat burgers but made an exception for Five Guys due to all the \"omgz this is awesome\" hype.  It's 3 stars...better than fast food but not something to go out of my way for."}
{"text":"This place keeps it pretty fresh. Free in house peanuts to hold you over until your order is ready. Pretty fast, pretty friendly, pretty tasty. It's all good. They got a couple of those touch screen soda fountains so you can wet your whistle. If you have never been you might want to stop in sometime. It's worth a try and who knows? It might become your new burger and fries joint. Enjoy"}
{"text":"The burgers taste wonderful and the fries are great!  They give you tons of fries, enough to share.  The \"Little Burger\" is plenty too and the toppings are great for no extra charge.  

The location in Phoenix is more than a little crowded and hectic at lunch hour and parking is downtown parking so if you are looking for a calm, quiet lunch this is not the place to go.  Prices are a bit on the high end side too.

The free peanuts are a really cute touch!"}
{"text":"So, because I don't really have a life, I really enjoy spending time browsing Yelp reviews (seriously, like hours and hours!).  I'm very particular about my food and l like to learn all I can about a restaurant/food chain before visiting. That's how I discovered Five Guys. The reviews looked good enough (many 4 & 5 star ratings) to warrant a visit from me. The food pictures were enticing as well. However, I don't live near a Five Guys, so although I've known about the establishment for quite some time, I've never made it in to try it. That changed today!

I had to run an errand where there happens to be a Five Guys in the shopping center.(Maryland PKWY) I told my daughter I wanted to try it because I knew this was probably going to be my only chance. So, it was like now or never.

My daughter and I walked in and I took notice of the number of patrons dining in/purchasing food. The place was not super full, but there was a good amount of people sitting in eating and there were a lot of people coming in to take out their orders. This is something I am super huge on. If there is not anyone there I wonder why. The place was spacious, not overly crowded, and it was clean. No dirty tables in sight and the floor was shiny. Anyways, my daughter and I made our way to the front of the order line where we were immediately greeted by a smiling cashier. Remember, this was my first time visiting so it was comforting to be acknowledged. I ordered two Bacon Cheeseburgers. I was unaware that none of the burgers come with basic condiments (lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion,etc) however the cashier informed me that I just need to let them know what I want and they would add it (no charge). The condiments menu, I thought, offered a good variety of choices. I opted for the basics mentioned above, in addition to extra mayo and mustard. The total for the two bacon cheeseburgers came to about $16 (including tax). I've never in my life paid this much for just two burgers unless I was at a sit down restaurant. However, after going over the reviews on yelp I figured it was worth it. I don't mind paying a little more for quality food and a peaceful dining experience. 

So, we were given a receipt and told our order would be up shortly. My daughter and I moved to the waiting area where we were able to view up close our food being prepared. I loved this because as I stated previously I am very particular about my food and that includes how it's being prepared. The cooks wore gloves, ingredients looked fresh, and just knowing that our burgers were made to order right before our eyes (and not sitting under a warmer for who knows how long) made my anticipation grow. But...when they were done making the burgers and began wrapping them I became worried. I'd had in my mind that since I was paying roughly $8 for a burger, that they would be, well huge, especially since the bacon cheeseburger comes with a double patty. However, from a short distance, the burger appeared to be just average in size. Fine. Whatever. At this point I was expecting the worst (in terms of taste) but hoping for the best (I've had some huge let downs lately dining at new food establishments). And now to the taste test and the ultimate reason for my five star review:

BEST BURGER I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME!!!!!! I unwrapped my burger, my daughter did the same and upon first glance presentation was up to par. Nice. Looked good. Next, we both took our first bite. DELICIOUS. JUICY. Flavored well. I loved it and so did my daughter. It was at that moment that I was like yes! I'm gonna love this place and I really don't mind the price because hey it's quality and for me that's something that has been hard to come by in Vegas. We wanted to eat half of our burgers there and take the other half home to have for later but we couldn't. We each devoured ours within minutes. To us it was that good!. I'll be back one day for sure.

Also, I wanted to add that the restrooms seem to be well kept; very clean, but no seat covers. 

Overall, our experience was great! Definitely what I expect when I dine anywhere - cleanliness, good customer service from workers, and food that's worth the money you pay. This place met all of the marks, hands down! Would recommend. Five stars from me!"}
{"text":"So glad they finally opened up out here.  Missing them from my days living in the DC area.  It's nice to go to a place and not have to have some secret handshake or know the special code, \"animal double dribble with a side of wasssssuuuup\" or however y'all order at that In n Out place.  

Looking forward to the opening of the one on Craig Rd. as it will be better than having to travel to Hendertucky all the time. 

The deal is, those that love In N Out will hate Five Guys and vice versa.  Didn't realize the burger wars were worse than the east coast/west coast rap wars.  It's just food!"}
{"text":"yuk! service and food sucked never a
gain!"}
{"text":"Burgers are good but soggy. You need to ask them not to wrap the burger in aluminum foil or it will be dripping wet. Fries are good. Pricey for fast food."}
{"text":"I usually hit up Five Guys when I am craving something disgusting yet utterly delicious. While I will always believe that my grandfather makes the best hamburgers and Cookout is a close second, Five Guys is pretty damn good. The first time I ever visited, I ordered a burger and a regular fry for myself which was a huge mistake. I received a burger as big as my head and a gigantic paper bag full of french fries. I didn't even make a dent in my burger and fries. Now that I am a more experienced diner, I stick to a little hamburger and split the regular fry with whoever I happen to be feasting with. The toppings are free which is awesome (except the bacon and cheese) and they also sell hot dogs. I definitely recommend Five Guys but I would definitely cool it on the large fry and the regular-sized burgers, remember: less is more."}
{"text":"Was told by the cashier that their payment terminal doesn't work with BMO cards. Luckily the person I was with could lend me cash. There with one other person. There was a really long wait between him getting his food and my food being ready. We ordered the same thing. Didn't time it but it was over five minutes. No explanation why. 
No longer a fan, at least if this location."}
{"text":"At the time of writing (August 2012), this might be the quietest Five Guys anywhere.  Even at lunch time, it is not busy.  Great, because the one in Scarborough is a bit of a zoo.

If you haven't been to Five Guys before, here's the deal.  The patties are allegedly fresh and never frozen, and I think this is true, because their raw patties are bright red.  Also, they are griddled burgers--not char broiled.  There is a huge difference here.  Griddled burgers are cooked on a flat top, kind of like breakfast, and it cooks in its own fat.  If done right, as they do here, it should have a nice \"crust\" outside, and it should be juicer than char broiled.  What you lose, of course, are the grill marks and the smell of fat drippings hitting the heating element and smoking back up.  It is a matter of preference on which is better.  Five Guys makes some of the best griddled burgers though.

Five Guys takes special pride in their fries.  I think they are a bit dry.  Too much starch has been removed, in my opinion.. thought that wouldn't be possible, but it is true here.  Their cajun fries are not good.  It is something that they sprinkle on afterwards, not while frying.  It is the typical cajun seasoning that you can buy at grocery stores (paprika, oregano, cayenne, cumin, etc).

Some things to keep in mind while ordering:

1.  Little = 1 Patty,  Regular = 2 Patties
2.  Regular Fries = Feeds 2,  Large = Feeds 3-4
3.  There is no discount for getting a \"combo\".

A cheese burger combo will hit you up nearly 15 bucks after taxes.  Yikes.  Sure it is quality meat and all, but places like South Street Burgers can do grass fed burgers for less.  What gives?  It's a piece of Americana, but with price in mind, I can only give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"I love 5 guys and have enjoyed most location across North America. I was excited to have one only 4 mins from my house. I went the other day for a burger just before opening. I waited a few minutes to open and ordered my food. I sat down and waited for my food for 25 mins. There was three staff members sitting at a table next to the bathrooms eating what looked like food from home. They didn't have any peanuts out or even ketchup. Basically they weren't ready to open or they didn't care I was a paying customer. If I was the owner I would be upset that I just paid 3 employees for an hour of work for nothing. I have been here 3 other times and the service was as expected. I will still come again because I love 5 guys. Just would of been nice to snack on some peanuts while I was waiting 25 mins for my burger."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to find a FIVE GUYS when we are traveling. As expected, this location delivered on the goods!!  Delicious!!
All toppings on the burgers are free, you can't finish the copious amount of fries you get, and the peanuts take the edge off your hunger while waiting for your made to order meal!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Kentucky and had never heard of five guys.  All my friends here were soooo excited when they saw the \"coming soon\" sign on mill ave. So, as a serious burger lover, i got my hopes up and couldnt wait to check it out.

Sorry to say, i wasnt impressed.  I realize its a chain and those are always a let down but the hype that preceeded my visit definately killed it for me.  For what it is,  the prices are pretty outrageous, the wait is pretty long, and the employees were pretty much a-holes.  I think it came out to about 11 bucks for a burger, fries and drink.  And no the peanuts did not cushion the blow.  For the money Id take Chuckbox over here any day."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place. Fresh this, fresh that. One of the most nasty burgers I have had. Grease and more grease and if you want grease fries, they have them.
Not for my family or me. None of us like the food"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?!?!?! $24 for two Burger's and an order of fires, and you can't even get it right? Don't ask me after I've gone back three times for the stuff you forgot to put on my $9 burger?!?!? Burn the bacon, undertook the burger?!?!? Never going back, on to Culver's!

7/21/2016 - just an update Five Guys... I still haven't gone back, and not thinking we will... change your attitude, it's easy to get knocked off your high and mighty perch... ask the guys at Quizno's how their superior attitudes and shrinking servings did for them"}
{"text":"Great burgers 
Neat concept to the old burger
Staff was ok
The need a Mgr that washes his hands 
Luckily he did not handle my food"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the burgers and fries from Five Guys! Fast service, food cooked well, love the drink machine! I'm not a big fan of the Cajun seasoning for the fries....they use too much. If they would do a light dusting then it would be perfect. 

It's really hard to compare them to In-N-Out because they do their own thing and I dress up my burger different from what is offered at I-N-O...

Good stuff, highly recommended."}
{"text":"What do you say about Five Guys that hasn't been said before?

Burgers are definitely better than the fast food average. With unlimited toppings (and some nice ones like fried onions or fried mushrooms) it's tempting to load up the burger. Avoid the temptation. The key to maximizing your Five Guys experience seems to be not getting over zealous with the toppings and managing moisture. The burgers themselves are tasty, but not terribly large; adding a mess of fried onions, pickles and tomatoes usually seems to just create a burger mess.

My sweet-spot tends to be:
- Cheeseburger
- Jalapenos (fresh, not pickled. This adds decent heat and a nice vegetal low-end to the burger.)
- Raw onion (the grilled onion tastes good, but makes the burger too soggy)
- Lettuce, no tomato (again, brings the sog)
- Ketchup, mayo, relish, but BBQ sauce and mustard on the side

I usually order the regular fries, as I find the Cajun a little to salty. Fries can be hit-and-miss, sometimes ending up undercooked and under salted. When they're \"on\" however, just dump them into your bag and rip off the top for a classy and convenient paper serving vessel.

I only ever get a reg. drink, with free refills I'm not sure what the lure of the large is.
I should also note that every time I've been there it seems like the soda is a little \"lean\" (less syrup, or maybe just more carbonation if they are using pre-mix?). I really like that, my wife not so much. We also disagree on the \"ambiance\"...she finds it a little cold and off-putting, while I try to argue that it reflects a singular interest in good burgers...no extras, no decorating, no marketing, just burgers."}
{"text":"Decent burgers and a mountain of fresh and tasty fries...At a price....

One of a group of different burger chains that have sprouted up in the valley over the last few years.  The burgers are cooked on a griddle and topped with your options of toppings at no extra cost (except for bacon), and are hot and juicy.

The bad.  

How can you give dozens of choices for toppings and only have American cheese (which most foodies would not even consider actual cheese).  Where is the swiss and cheddar?

Secondly, the price you pay is a bit high.  My bill alone came to $14.85 (bacon cheeseburger, soda & fries), which is almost what you would pay at a high end steak place for a much better burger and fries.  

Even at my favorite burger restaurant, I get a 1/2 pound burger, fries and a drink for only $10.85, that is $4 cheaper for a flame-broiled burger.  For those of us on a budget, it is not worth the extra cost to come here.

During my visit the place was also filled with smoke, and the doors were wide open.  I don't know if there was an issue with the ventilation system or they were just trying to give the place a more \"downtown-like\" (polluted) atmosphere.

One last thing...

I love that they use the quote \"The best $5 burger a man can get\" to advertise the place, when the cheapest (normal) burger they sell starts at $5.99!"}
{"text":"I heard the HYPE and I ventured out, not too far thank God, to try this burger joint.  I kept seeing BEST BARGAIN signs all over.  I didn't think the $20 i spent on a double burger, large fries, large drink and a hot dog was much of a bargain, SORRY!!  They advertised WHERE the fries of the day came from but ultimately I didn't care where the fries were from, they were SOGGY!!  Wast of potatoes if you ask me.  Burger was OKAY.  A lot like IN-N-OUT burger but not as good. The soda machine was cool!! For local PHOENIX burgers, I recommend LENNY'S BURGERS.   I got a double burger, a single burger, two hot dogs and two fries at LENNY'S for $20.  Far superior burger and fries, by the way."}
{"text":"Please keep in mind that I went to the Laird Ave. location in Leaside. I ordered a \"Little Bacon Cheeseburger\", Fries and Regular Coke and my total cost was $13.75. What an effing rip off!!!! When I got the food (which took altogether too long for a burger and fries), it was underwhelming. The burger was small and relatively tasteless, the fries were decent, and the Coke tasted like a fountain Coke. What I should have done was go to Square Boy at Donlands and Danforth and gotten a banquet burger, fries and a coke for far less and would have had a much better experience.

Completely overrated. Garbage."}
{"text":"7/30. Nice and friendly place. Peanuts while you wait. Ordered a bacon burger and little fries. Burger you can customize we added jalapenos to ours. Regular burger comes with 2 patties, Nice and juicy.  The fries you get 1/2 a bag full and freshly made."}
{"text":"First time ever in this store and in the chain.  Finally a good quality burger in the West Island! It isn't cheap but is worth every penny. Well prepared,  fresh,  tasty,  you name it! Spicy fries are a must."}
{"text":"Me and my wife frequent quality burger joints around the city and we're yet to find one that's meets the quality of five guys! No matter which one you go to they are the best with the same quality at them all. Mostly go to the one on warden and eglinton, big smiles and free salted peanuts"}
{"text":"Its a build your own Burger place. I'm not a fan of that. Similar to subway sandwiches.  They don't have their own way. You have to give them all ingredients you want from their list. Kinda a pain. But if Your a picky eater, This might work for you.  The meat was tasty but small. The house fries were plentiful and Good.  Everything is separate price. Burger,  fries, and drink.  Ends up being around $12.  Try it once, see If you like it."}
{"text":"It seams impassable to get your order the way you ordered it. It happened several times to me when I ordered stuff and they charged me for it , and I ended up not getting it in the sandwich"}
{"text":"I finally had Five Guys. We made 800 jokes on the way, after we ordered, I swore the cashier told us to enjoy some penis while we waited. Excuse me? Oh. Peanuts. Of course, all burger joints have peanuts?! A bit bizarre, but they were tasty. We all ordered a burger to our liking and we shared cajun fries. My cheeseburger with grilled onions and jalapenos was good, it tasted like something you'd make at home. The fries were terrible. Not sure how they've earned such recognition. I like crisp fries, these were flimsy and greasy, and I wasn't a fan of cajun seasoning, either. Overall, I stand by In-N-out."}
{"text":"Only giving one star due to their ridiculous policy of not providing water cups. I asked for a cup of water and was given a cup. I looked at my receipt and I was charged for a drink! I asked about this and was told that water cups are only for children and the elderly. Non sense! He (Malcolm the cashier) could have told me before he charged me!"}
{"text":"Probably the Best Burger place I have been to in AZ. I LOVE Burgers and will not pass up a Burger place. I came here and was suprised they gave free peanuts to mucn on while your waiting in line. The Cooks look serious at what they do, but looks like their having fun too. I like the Happy Fast enviroment in there. 
The Burgers are Bigger than regular fast food burgers. Tastes Better too. They use Peanut oil. But the burgers are great and they offer sauted mushrooms and onions. Lots of ways to customize your burger.
Wouldnt change anything unless you can make a 5lb burger."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying five guys isn't bad.  The burgers are perfectly acceptable but I feel as if they are kind of caught in a void between two places.  First of all what it's not, five guys is not a quality burger, if you want a good burger go to Dotty Dumplings or the Weary Traveler and shell out 8-10 dollars.  On the other hand Five Guys isn't quite McDonald's style fast food.  The place has more class to it than a McDonalds with it's quirks like free unlimited peanuts and the meat is certainly of a higher quality.  However what it comes down to is Five Guys does serve up a greasy burger and if that's what you're in the mood for that's fine.  Sometimes when I've eaten at Five Guys though I've just wished I'd spent the extra three bucks and a bit of time and went out to Dotty Dumplings or the Weary Traveler for a good burger, not just the quick burger fix that Five Guys offers."}
{"text":"Typical burger joint. Lots of toppings to chose from. Burger is flat. Needs to be spiced up. It's cooked well and not dry at all. The little fries that I ordered fed 4 of us. Mushrooms were canned. Total for the burger and large drink was about $12. Service was good, soda fountain lots to chose from also. Free peanuts while u wait."}
{"text":"Great burgers, nice service but the price is a little high. The cajun fries spicy are not that tasty. I like that there are no fillers or preservatives and the toppings are free. I will come back and try their hot dog, nice sitting outside next to Starbucks. Love love love love the fact that you can choose any soda that you want."}
{"text":"I used to think that only I could make cheeseburgers that were great.  This place actually makes them better than I do!  But don't go for the full size burgers, go for the small size.  They're more than enuf to eat for most people.  Good fries too and very cheerful and fun staff.   And I've never had a long wait here either."}
{"text":"Ok after a rough start - They've remodeled and the burgers are worth writing about.  Don't know what happend that first time, I believe it was the 90 degree inside with the 90 percent humidity.   Sometimes, the frys come out too well done.  I really like the dogs, but wish they had a chicago dog on the menu."}
{"text":"If you Re craving a burger and fries, this is the place!  Made fresh for you with your choice if a multitude of toppings. They give you a Heck of a lot of fries in a regular sized fry, enough for three or four to share

I gave four stars instead of five because the tables were dirty. The place was not busy at all but the employees were standing around doing nothing....they could have been cleaning up the place."}
{"text":"I wish I could totally give this place 100 stars! Walked in with my family and noticed the place clean . The cashier, Jordann G., asked if we had been there before, which we hadn't, so she kindly explained the menu as it is a bit confusing -burgers are labeled little but are regular size for instance. I absolutely love that I can custom my burger toppings without any additional charges ! Each hamburger was individually wrapped in aluminum foil with a number sticker on it, we ordered 4 burgers so numbers were 1-4..only problem with that was trying to remember who ordered their food in what order as they're not labeled on the receipt. The burgers & fries are absolutely delicious! My family & I loved the food, and I have a pickey child lol. The staff are super friendly and we definitely will be returning customers and referring family & friends to this location"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. The burgers are delicious as well as the fries but the price can give me a heart attack. Honestly the price is the only reason why continue to go to in and out before I decide to go to five guys. They use Coke products but I prefer Pepsi. I do like the fact that they give you free peanuts while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"I like 5 Guys' burgers.  They make them to order.  The fries are a bit over rated.  They tend to get soggy if you don't eat them right away, like right when you get them and  before you eat your burger.  Mostly I think people rave about these fries because you get so many.  I'd recommend the burgers, but pass on the fries unless you're planning on sharing them and eating them fast."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an American-style burger and fries that's not going to set you back more than a few toonies, then you'll enjoy Five Guys Burger & Fries.

Their name spells out the two food items that make up their most popular items.  The fries are served regular and cajun style.  5 Guys also offers hot dogs, veggie burgers, and grilled cheese sandwiches.

If you are allergic to peanuts, avoid 5 Guys.  They cook everything in peanut oil and have open boxes of peanuts in-store to eat at your leisure.

Also be aware of the different burger sizes when ordering. A regular size burger will come with two beef patties, while a 'small' come with with one.

I'm a big fan of the small cheeseburger with bacon and loaded up with great toppings of lettuce, tomato, pickles, grilled onions and grill mushrooms.

If you are looking for a quick, inexpensive burger in Montreal, check out 5 guys."}
{"text":"I paid 20 Dollars for 2reg burgers 1Fry 1 drink. Though the staff was helpful and nice, My burger lacked thejuicy FlavorFi1 patty I had hoped For."}
{"text":"I got to admit I have been a little obsessed with five guys lately been here at least 10 times within a month. Time to give it a littlebreak and get back in shape!
I love the cajun fries and adding some grilled jalepenos in my burgers just sets it off, I better stop my mouth is getting watery thinking about it.
Will be back on ny cheat day!!"}
{"text":"Today there were 5 women rockin' the grill and cooking.  They were working hard and having fun. Laughing and getting things done. Loved to see the great teamwork.  Service with a smile. 

And the food was great, as usual."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from every staff member and clean. The burgers, of course, are amazing every time."}
{"text":"Okay i have been here a few times. First off Newt the manager is one of the best people in the fast food business. He took our order with professionalism and knew everything about the entire menu. He had the shop super clean and everyone running it perfectly. Food was excellent and i will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I don't see what the big deal is. When I went the soda machine was broken, and the food was bland. Didn't really think the fries were anything to care about. Very sub-par, and more over, just because they give you all you can eat, free peanuts, doesn't mean you should pay so much for a burger or hot dog. Not worth the money, not worth the trip in my opinion. Wouldn't return, wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I had not had one of these since an East Coast swing last year. Real meat, real potatoes and a really happy belly. Do not forget to the spicy fries. What made this one different was the crew this particular afternoon. All super happy to be these, grooving out on the tunes, and fulfilled every request happily...extra spicy salt, extra hot sauce, and mustard on the side. Four really Good Guys at this location."}
{"text":"Best five guys I've ever been to. Great service. Great upbeat attitude. Jacob, Mark, Amy, Brie..  thank you so much for making it a very pleasurable experience. See you again soon"}
{"text":"Alright over priced burgers. The last few times I've come here it hasn't been busy but seems to take a long time to get your food. Plus my burger is never hot. It's actually on the cold side. The cheese isn't even a little bit melted. I want to like it but unfortunately there are other places to get a better burger for a better price."}
{"text":"By far the best burger joint that I've found around town... Smashburger comes close, but not close enough since the prices of the two places are pretty much the same."}
{"text":"They have a good burger but the fries, hot dogs and the fancy soda machine suck.
The yelling out order numbers is out of control, it's annoying and flat out RUDE!
You pay $45  at a burger joint to enjoy the company of family and friends not an employee that is yelling out order numbers. Turn down the music. Won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The Good: The Bacon Cheeseburger

The Bad: The futuristic Battlestar Galactica soda machine that dispensed diet coke that had hints of cherry, dr. pepper and sprite in it. It was like an old \"suicide\" drink.....except the machine actually chooses the flavors for you and it tastes like hell.

The Ugly: $12.54 for a burger, fries (which could have fed a village) and a coke. I understand that their better ingredients would warrant a higher price and I actually didn't mind paying that price until after I was done.

Back to the fries for a minute....the fries were pretty good, not great. I do not complain often about having too much food but the size of the order of fries for one person is just plain stupid. More than half ended up in the trash. 

My recommendation would be to go with another person and split a burger and fries......and drink tea or water so you do not have to deal with the T-1000 super duper drink dispenser."}
{"text":"11 dollars and change for a little hamburger, little fry and drink. Seriously. Yes, the cajun fries can be shared between probably at least three people. Yes, the little hamburger isn't all that little and has a lot of free toppings. Yes, the drink is the fun Coke freestyle machine and you can drink as much as you want. Yes, there are free peanuts for some reason. But I just get very very annoyed at that price point. Even a hot dog with no sides is 4 dollars. So the only way it really makes sense to eat here, a fast food restaurant with great fries and reasonable burgers, is to bring two friends, split the fry, get a little burger, and eat 5 dollars worth of peanuts. I dunno, maybe I am not in the majority for what I expect a fast food burger to cost.

If you want to spend a lot on a burger, and feel like you are getting some kind of value, go to Smash burger or ANY local burger place. In Charlotte, there's Kickstand, Bang Bang, etc. Or go to JJ's Redhots for a killer hot dog. 

Service has always been reasonably quick and friendly here, no problems with that."}
{"text":"Ate a little Bacon cheeseburger yesterday and I want to go back today for a double. If only it was a bigger burger and less money."}
{"text":"This review was of my second time eating at Five Guy's.

I had five guys once before - my first experience wasn't good because I didn't know what toppings to get and the place was packed, so I was a little rushed into choosing which toppings I wanted to order. 

I went to Five Guy's at 9pm on a Wednesday. The service here was great. The girl at the counter was cute and helped me choose my order after I told her I just ate and was looking for something small.

The four stars, however is for the quality of the food. I like that they make the burgers right when you order, which takes about 4-5 minutes. You can customize what you want on the burger - onions, ketchup, green peppers, etc. The burgers are pretty good for $5, but with fries (regular = $2.89) and a drink (regular = $1.99), it can add up really quick to $10. The quality of the burger though is similar to something you would find at a burger joint like Max and Erma's or Red Robin, except slightly smaller and you don't have to pay tip - which is a good thing. They overloaded my order with a lot of fries, which I couldn't finish (which is something I never do) and had to take home. The fries were mediocre in taste - could use more salt; I prefer Wendy's fries to Five Guy's. 

The quality of the food is overall great; taste isn't the best but decent. For those who say it is the \"In-N-Out\" of the midwest, I disagree. However, it is a decent burger. 

Lastly, I agree with the other yelp comments on the employees, who can be a bit loud. The cook seemed to be yelling and talking to the other employees throughout my whole meal. Not a huge problem, but just something to note."}
{"text":"Good burger, but wayyyyy to expensive. Since when does a burger and fries cost $15? Not worth it, many other burger joints around that are just as good for a better price."}

So, I believe that chick fil-a also cooks in peanut oil as well and I know my son can eat that. So I asked the cashier if she knew if they cooked in peanut oil and she said she wasn't sure so I explained why I asked and thought maybe she might know from personal experience. So she understood, and then proceeded to ask the cooks and one guy yelled out I don't know this isn't Chick fil A its five guys!!! Totally humiliating and not embarrassing!!!

My husband intervened because he became very upset at the smart remark and explained the reason for the question again. After that we decided to leave. 

Very very poop customer service and I will not eat at that location again!!!"}

{"text":"5 Guys is great.  Love the burgers and fries, though every time we eat there we have a lot of fries leftover.  Usually get the double Bacon cheeseburger with everything and A1 sauce, fries and a drink and always leave full and happy.  Finally tried a hot dog which was Great.  You can choose the same topping for your hamburger for your hot dog. Much better than IN&OUT and your burger fast food chains.  Yes a little pricer but willing to pay more to have my food cook to order than a reheated burger.  Very friendly and happy staff. The noisy atmosphere works for me and JR, he can be a little more vocal and not bother anyone.  Mellow Yellow is good but also good to see Coke Zero on tap too."}
{"text":"Best fast food burgers you can get!

They always give you WAY fries more than you expect!  I swear, if you order a \"small\" fries... they put a small cup in a bag... and then just dump fries into the bag...  So you're really just telling them how big of a cup you want in your massive bag of fries :)

Food takes longer than other fast food places, but they have the shelled peanuts and fancy soda machines to keep you busy for the extra 3 minutes... so no complaints there."}
{"text":"Five Guys in Dubuque, Iowa. Me and my boyfriend got a Bacon Cheeseburger, No fries because fryer was broke down :( But while I was eating the Cheeseburger I started to feel sick.

I got a Bacon Cheeseburger with Lettuce and ketchup. And my boyfriend got a Bacon cheeseburger with Lettuce, pickles, a1 sauce. And none of the ingredients tasted good. But didn't want $20 to go down the drain. My opinion is. I'm never going to that Five Guys again."}

We placed a simple order for 6 different burgers because of all the great reviews we were getting about them. So, we'd figure to give it a shot. I didn't see what all the hype was about. We ended up with 1 burger being done correctly. which was a plain cheeseburger. All the others they said,\" they were all everything on it.\" It was not what we were expecting. We used their website to generate a list for our special order due to food allergies. After we received the order back from us picking it up, 5 of the 6 burgers were wrong, and the folks couldn't enjoy them because they were allergic to the toppings they decided to put everything on it. They can be rest assured that we are not going to come back to them. I hate giving 1 star reviews but i adhere caution to those who are trying this for the first time. I hope you receive better service and quality than we did."}
{"text":"Little Cheeseburger+Little Fries+Ice Tea

So I made myself a Little combo here, because I have heard the regular burgers are massive.

Place:
This is a nice, big, and inviting spot although when you get the food, it gives you the feeling of those \"hole in the wall\" restaurants that are really great. The staff was really nice, very polite, and very helpful with my order.

Food:
So I tried the little fries and I chose to go with the Cajun style fries; let me tell you those fries are wonderful. what's really cool is once they've packed the brownbag it seems like they throw more fries into the bag just for fun. I dig that!

So I ordered the Little burger with my toppings, and they were not stingy with the toppings which is great. The burger was cooked well and was just very succulent the whole way through. Very tasty.

The only downfall of this whole thing is that it is pricey and every item must be bought individually."}
{"text":"First time I have gone to this place after passing the St. Rose location many times and seeing it way too crowded.  I love a good burger so wanted to give this place a try.  I am giving it 3 stars for two specific reasons but I will give my review first.

The burger itself was pretty good but I still prefer In N Out and even Smashburger.  French Fries were good but nothing spectacular.  The soda machine was totally awesome and I love all the options.  It's also funny watching people try to figure it out.  The customer service was very friendly and they seem trained to be so.

The place is good, not great, and worth a try.  The reason for 3 stars and not more is because of the price and the food not being anything note-worthy.  A friend and I went together, two burgers, two fries, two sodas and it was $22.  The prices are a little crazy.  And while the food is certainly good and I have no complaints about it, it wasn't anything to write home about.  I would give 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Great, juicy, burger. I got the bacon burger with everything, it even comes with mushrooms! It was cooked to perfection, without pink in the middle (I'm picky about the pink in burgers-sensitive stomach) but it was still juicy and tender on the inside. The employees had smiles on their faces and were very friendly. The man with an Irish accent, who's name I'm upset I don't remember, was over the top helpful to all the customers in the joint. It was nice to receive such happy service coming from a \"fast food\" place. Then after they bagged my order they put a whole 'nother scoop of fries in the bag on top of everything! Seriously, who doesn't love bag fries?"}
{"text":"Always walk there after a day work from cmu. Good place for a quick dinner,  a two patties cheese burger(tomato, pickles,grilled mushroom and lettuce), a little fries(ok, regular fries if too hungry), and plus a drink. The staff are welcoming. Enjoy the free peanuts while waiting. I have tried the five guys once in Belmont, CA, but the branch near pitt is far better than the one in Belmont."}
{"text":"On \"The List\"...of places NOT to revisit.  In fact we have named that list \"The Five Guys List\".

Went here on two recommendations and couldn't wait for the \"best burgers and fries\".  Ordered a single bacon cheeseburger with LT only.  Maybe it is because I use no condiments that I can really \"taste\" the burgers I order.  This one was dry,unseasoned and the cheese was not melted. The bacon consisted of two cold, hard, overcooked \"chips\" that I had to crunch through.  The lettuce and tomato were fresh.  My husband had a double with cheese and mushrooms...not very many... same unmelted cheese.   We added an order of those \"famous\" fries.  I was told you would get \"so many fries\", just get one order.  These fries were not hot, overcooked and actually there were not that many in the bag and cup.  We had to get salt packets to add some flavor.  

Overall, $20+ for two burgers, one order of fries and two sodas... not impressed.  Fuddruckers and LBS may cost a few bucks more, but much, much better."}
{"text":"The big greasy bag of fries may make you wince at first...but let me tell ya they're pretty damn good!

Good, fresh burgers and fries.  A TON of fries.  Really, I don't NEED all those fries!  But I'll eat them.  Oh yes, I will.  The only thing that would make this place better?  A drive-thru!  But really, I don't need that either. Getting out of my car and walking inside ...ah yes, what a grueling workout!"}
{"text":"So this is the first time to a much anticipated Five Guys in Leaside.  In a new complex just off of Laird, there is a new burger joint in the east end.  Popular even at 2:30 on a Sunday, the burgers were done well.  The only thing was I asked for a cheeseburger and got a hamburger.  Perhaps the order taker needs to listen better.  Oh well, the food is like every other Five Guys I've been to.  We didn't order fries this time around, but we'll see next time.  I've always gotten a pile of fries in the bag and I noticed the people around me didn't have the telling greasy bags of fries."}
{"text":"This place is my go to place for burgers when traveling. The staff was so excited and enthusiastic when I arrived. I ordered the bacon cheese burger which was delicious. I ordered the small fries and then they pour more into my bag before giving me my order... I ordered my burger \"all the way\" which comes with lots of toppings. I will come back here again. Also a plus is the free peanuts."}
{"text":"I have been very curious since they opened to do my own comparison between Five Guys' burgers and Smashburger.  Verdict: in this category of fast-casual, I like Smashburger much better.

Five Guys has a nice concept.  You can really customize your burger with whichever toppings you would like and even customize your soda.  Everything tasted fresh and service was extremely friendly - someone checked on our table twice to see if we needed anything.  I had sauteed onions, bacon and BBQ sauce.  The bacon was crisp and generous, but the bun, though soft, was less substantial than I like for my burger.  The fries were a great texture, though I didn't personally care for the cajun seasoning and would get plain if I returned.

In all, not a gourmet burger, but a step up from strictly fast food."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers for sure! Add that with the Cajun fries and it makes the meal even better!

The free peanuts is a nice touch.

I'd give it 4.5 but the app doesn't let it. I'd deduct the half star just for the price. We got a 2 burgers (reg and little) with med fries and large drink cost me $25.

Best burger joint in the area."}
{"text":"Below is a general review of the two AZ locations I have been to, and at the bottom will be notes specific to this location...

This place definitely is not for everyone.  If you like Mickey-D's or In n Out then you probably should just keep on walking.  But if you like a burger that was made when you order it or fries that are real potatoes and don't taste like the cup they came in then this place could be a great option.

They are a little pricier than your average quick service joint, but its worth it.  The portions are HUGE, even if you order the \"regular\" fries and the \"little\" burger they are still BIG.  They don't charge per topping beyond the norm like Smashburger, and they have tons of toppings to choose from.  Would love to see a fried egg option, but other than that the majority of burger loving taste buds will find topping options that please them.  They have some non-burger choices as well, which is nice.  Hot dogs, grilled cheese (which people keep saying is a must try) and a veggie sandwich.

Eating here is a 5 napkin type experience, a lil messy, a lil crazy, but oh so yummy!  Hint: if you are transporting 5 guys in your car, definitely put something between the bag and your (clothes, passenger seat, floor mat, etc..)  the grease WILL leak through the bag.


I agree with a below post that the placement of peanut snacking boxes are a little awkward  (and frankly I don't get why they exist at all, but whatever)

BELL ROAD Location Specific:  Easier to get to if you enter on the Bell road side.  Staff seems to be more personable than the Mill ave location (at least on the day I visited)  Parking is vast and free."}
{"text":"Lets face it, who does not like to go out for a burger rather than making one at home? The task of creating then grilling, following cleanup etc, sometimes is worth a treat to try someone else's idea of a burger, especially when travelling, a more than a safe bet. Consistency and taste are critical elements that will draw you back to the same restaurant or chain, after all decor means little if you are consuming a sub par product. 

I confess to not ever eating another Burger King item, just an insult to your senses when the pattie is wafer thin & tasteless, McD's is just average, Harvey's can be hit or miss but lately Wendy's has been a more favourable choice with the new Hot & Juicy signature burger. However, combined they do not even hold a candle to the wind to a hearty 5Guys creation. If it were not for President Obama being elected, I think most of us would have never heard of this chain.

Go back a few years to that election. As a tradition NBC news will spend a few days with the new president shortly after taking office. During this airing a moment of pure humbleness unfolds. The President and his crew with news team in tow embark on an \"Off the record\" trek. All the vehicles stripped of any Presidential markings wind through the streets of Washington until they arrive at the original 5Guys location. You can see what happens if you do a search on \"Youtube\", perhaps this event was the largest free endorsement any business could be given!! 

Fast forward to summer 2011 while travelling through Colorado presented my first chance to try 5Guys. In just a few words....absolutely lipsmaking Delicious!! I will elaborate in just a bit. Another travel through Rochester, New York during the Christmas holidays in 2011 then twice since the beginning of 2012 at the D.D.O branch in the West Island of Montreal. 

As mentioned before, consistency & taste are what will draw you to be a loyal client, and in this area 5Guys has what will give me the confidence to try any branch on either side of our border. Indeed more expensive than other fast food chains, but if it means that I will go the 5Guys once rather than another chain twice the quality of the food is just worth that formula. One of my initial tests of a Burger is to take a bite from the pattie without the influences of the other ingredients to feel the texture of the meat or any of the seasonings. All my times it has been a tasty, juicy experience!!

Indeed the decor is a simple take on a restaurant. Extreme flashy decor takes a back seat to a wide open expanse of red & white ceramic tiled walls, tons of fresh potato sacs in the centre of the eating quarters a bold statement to the fresh theme of no frozen foods. The cashier has the important task to not only call out the orders, but initially take the time to explain the process to newcomers, all with a great smile and cheerful demeanour. You can have as many toppings as you like, as well if you don't mention anything a series of basic toppings highlighted in black ink will be added. The first time I ordered the small bacon cheeseburger with \"small\" fries.I was barely able to finish both as the burger was just the correct size, but the fries were good for at least 2 people. The next time I ordered the regular B&C burger that consists of 2 patties then shared an order of fries. My philosophy is you are going for a burger, the fries are just a \"filler\". Drinks are endless, so save a bit of money buy ordering a small drink, then enjoy the free refills!!

As you sit to enjoy your meal you notice the newspaper or other media testimonials decorating the walls as well some free paper and coloured pencils where you can broadcast your own thoughts. All add to a fun environment that is simply lacking in other major chain restaurants. 

In another thread someone predicts 5Guys will last only a few years, I strongly disagree with their thoughts. With the other major chains trying to reinvent themselves I think 5Guys has given them reason to worry, after all they have taken us for advantage all these years, time for someone else to make us look forward to going out for a classic fast food meal.

Thanks so much 5Guys!!

{"text":"Fries is family size lol burger portion are good. However, the taste is a little disappointed, not juicy enough. Considering the price and the time waited (20 min), won't go their often."}
{"text":"Huge hamburgers, absolutely delicious!! We ordered half a basket of fries and didn't finish it between three of us."}
{"text":"Nummy.

LOVE 5 guys. Best burgers. Fries are pretty good."}
{"text":"I usually have no problems here but tonight was not great.  My burger bun came out very soggy and did not hold up to normal standards.  The fries will also a tad bit over-salted.  I walked in at 7 and wasn't served my food until almost 7:45.  Yes, they were busy but they were also short staffed and the the main cook (they young man who never touched the cash register) was visibly upset with his counterpart.  There was one guy in back who might have been prepping but he only emerged once or twice.  Both of the employees I interacted with were courteous and  I might give them another try some day but I think it is time to take a break from this location.... thanks guys.. hope this was a one-time fluke."}
{"text":"Underwhelming.  Don't believe the hype.. Fries are extra greasy, burgers are ok but I'm pretty certain the cheese is processed which is a disappointment for the price you pay.  The only real good thing about going there is the free peanuts.  Do not recommend unless you have no where else within 15 km."}
{"text":"I have heard this place was good so we gave it a go.  Ordered two cheeseburgers, adult fry and 1 drink as I had water.  The bun was so stale when I cut it in half and took a bite, everything slid off and hit the wrapper.  The fries were cold and the burger bun was kinda small.  Was not impressed at all. For $28 I should have been impressed.  Will not return even if someone else is buying.  I will say the staff was very nice and friendly..... one thing they could change is offer the food on a tray instead of cramming it in a bag.  If you are on 75th & Bell Road you need to be competitive in every facet of food service because there are a lot more places to eat there.  Moving on....."}
{"text":"Awesome...this is really clean!!! Employees are helpful & cheerful!!! Thanks for a great burger!!!"}
{"text":"We Love this place. We been to so many Five Guys, Burgers are sooo good. But they are so SLOWWWWWW. give it a try."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys and this location! The employees are always nice and the food comes out quick. You get hooked up with fries regardless but I was extra-hooked up today. The lobby is always clean and the cooks always seem to be having a good time with each other. I love the music FG plays throughout its stores too.

Their shakes are so good! I got a cherry one with extra cherry one time here and it was amazing. 

They give a discount (free drink) for fellow DTS mall employees which is a nice perk because they have the awesome Coke Freestyle machines. 

Thanks Five Guys!"}
{"text":"This place and the staff are always great. You can't go wrong with fresh burgers and delicious fries in an almost retro-feeling restaurant. They're always playing a good mix of music and every employee seems to enjoy the company of one another. They stay calm and organized during a rush and are always keeping the lobby clean. 

Will always be back here when I have the time to wait for a delicious burger and fries!"}
{"text":"So what is all the hype?  Not much to say here.  High priced fast food without a drive thru.  HMMMM, red n white.... remind you of.... In n Out.... oh how orginal.  OK the food... its a burger.  Quality...ok its a burger, I would say not memorable.  Not award winning.  Its a burger.  Service, its counter take out, they got the order right.  I was a number in a line and no eye contact with the girl.  Would i go back, probably not, the parking sucked ... with a drive thru maybe, but for the hassle, its not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"All over, people are raving about Five Guys Burgers & Fries. My friend up in Washington says she loves them. On their website they show off everyone singing their praises.

I must not get it.

I've been wanting to try them for quite some time, and learned they now have a spot open on the Strip (not the touristy part everyone knows, but a little further past Mandalay Bay at the Premium Outlets South). As that is on the way to my gym, I decided to roll out early, stop at Five Guys, and work it off at Fight Capital.

Walking in, you feel good about the place. It's kinda diner-y, simple... tables, chairs, and a team of employees hurriedly working on food in the kitchen. Kinda In-N-Out-esque. REALLY In-N-Out-esque. Like, you wonder if you walked into an In-N-Out instead of Five Guys. There was only one person ahead of me in line, and the cashier, Michelle, was quick and pleasant. I ordered a Bacon Burger, which if you leave it that way, is just that: bread, patty (actually two) and bacon. Anything else on it you have to make sure to specify, so I added my standard toppings -- lettuce, tomato, and BBQ sauce. An onion ring might have been a nice touch, but hey, I don't run the place. Didn't see mustard on the list... hmmmm... well, it's probably by the ketchup, because I didn't see that on the list either. I also ordered some Cajun fries and a drink.

So, let's start with some of the good things here. First off, the employees are very efficient. One person barked orders at the other, everyone had their station, very assembly-line style, and I got my food quickly, which was great because I was famished. Secondly, the Coke machine is, without a doubt, very cool. It's one of those new Coke-brand stations with a touch screen. You touch the soda you want, then you choose regular or with flavored syrup, and POOF -- it's Cokeapalooza! I went with a cherry Coke Zero. Wise choice. On my second visit I noticed there was Diet Barq's (root beer with BITE!), but no cherry option, and I was really diggin' on the cherry Coke Zero, so I went back to that.

The Cajun fries were some of the best I've had in a really long time. Zing-y, spicy, good with or without ketchup. Definitely was loving the fries.

Definitely was NOT loving the burger. Sure, it was a nice surprise that the burgers came standard with two patties, but they were kinda dry and lifeless. Apparently standard setting for their burgers is well-done. Any cook or chef will tell you that overcooking ground beef will cook out the juice and flavor of the meat, and that's what happened here. Bacon was overcooked as well. And by \"overcooked\" I mean \"burnt.\" Fortunately I had sauces to back me up, BBQ sauce and.....

Oh yeah. That's another thing. There's no mustard in the entire restaurant. Let me repeat that: THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MUSTARD IN THE ENTIRE HAMBURGER JOINT. No pump, no packets, nothing. I looked on the Coke machine to see if they had it stashed on their touch-screen. I thought about asking, but that would require the only non-assembly-line employee to leave her cash register. Plus, I thought, I shouldn't have to ask for mustard in a friggin' burger joint.

Final blow: Price. I ordered burgers, fries, and a drink, thinking, meh. $8. Should be okay with that. Oh no no, my friend. Everything is a la carte and you will order and take it up the wallet, my friend. By the time I had finished my order I was $11 in and there was no turning back. it felt as if the place was called \"Five Guys\" because you'd be paying the paychecks for five guys. Now, I would expect to pay $11, maybe more, at Holsteins or Burger Bar, where I would also not be looking for a \"quick bite\" and know I would get more (much more) bang for my buck (all eleven of them). This was not $11 quality. Nowhere close. Ironic, as I stared at the sign that said the Washingtonian or some other print media said in 2007 it was the \"best bargain\" around. Apparently in Washington you make a bazillion dollars an hour there. (Hmm... maybe The Gazillionaire is from Washington...)

So yeah. A mediocre burger with overcooked patties and overcooked price points. And no mustard. The employees saved it from being a one-star review though.

I probably won't be back here anytime in the near future; if I am it will be because someone dragged me there. I'll be the guy with only the Cajun fries, playing with the Coke machine."}
{"text":"Five Guys is always my go to when I want something quick for lunch or dinner, but I don't want crappy fast food. It's fast for how fresh they cook it, always nice and juicy burgers and the fries are always good. The hot dogs, all though I usually don't get them, are also very good. And now they have milkshakes! A little too big for my liking but hey it's good! Well priced for how good it is and service is always exceptional. Highly recommend if you are coming to town."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, and some of the best fries ever. It's as simple as that, go try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Below is a general review of the two AZ locations I have been to, and at the bottom will be notes specific to this location...

TEMPE Location Specific:  Could have just been the day I was here, but their Mr. Pibb tastes better than most places... who knows, perhaps they clean the machine well!  Parking is a bit of a challenge, it is on mill ave so it is meter parking and limited meter parking.  Mostly parallel, but next to American Apparel there are some standard metered spots as well.  Regardless, make sure you have change if you will be parking to go to grab your burger!"}
{"text":"First time visit.  Had a little bit of a time finding this place as it is tucked into a little corner facing Lake Mead Blvd.

We were a little ahead of the dinner crowd so the place was empty of customers.  The staff created us right away as they were busy preparing for the big rush.  The staff was helpful in explaining a few items.  Order taken and was ready in about 5-10 minutes.  We both had the \"little cheeseburgers\".  Little is a quarter pounder, and a \"cheeseburger\" has two beef patties.  
We shared a large order of fries.  The burgers were very tasty and the fries also.  You can customize your burger with about ten different toppings which are no additional charge.  

Overall it is a very good burger joint, and it is very clean.  You can also have she'll peanuts for free while wSiting for your order.

Update 1/11-2017********

Second visit much different.  I will say the employees were great.  Lady taking order gave us free fries when we related that our previous visit fries were very salty.  Also, she said she would go turn the air conditioning off.  It was extremely cold in the restaurant.  Food cane out and was cold almost immediately due to temp in building.  Meat was overlooked and dry on my little cheeseburger.  Also the cheese was missing.  Did not take it back to counter.  I would compare it to a run of the mill Burger King whopper.  Fries were good.  Probably our last visit here."}
{"text":"Five Guys is good eats.  We've been eating at this location frequently (perhaps too frequently!) since it opened.

Honestly, I don't think the food here is any fresher than In & Out Burger, but I like the selection of toppings (can you say, \"fresh jalapenos!\") and the great selection of sodas.

The peanuts are a nice touch to get you warmed up for the Main Event while you wait.

I personally think it's a little over-the-top to decorate the place in nothing but rave reviews (WE GET IT ALREADY!!), but the cool music makes up for the lack of ambience.

Since the Zagat announcement earlier this week, it's been mobbed.  Try to avoid peak hours, unless you want to wait for a table.

Five Guys is definitely pricier than In & Out, but I think the selection of ingredients justifies the premium.

3 tips:

-Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 kids under 10) can make do with one order of fries, though the orders have gotten smaller than when they first opened.

-Ditto for the burgers.  Don't let the moniker \"Little Cheeseburger\" fool you.  I got the regular burger...once.  But the \"Little\" one is perfectly sufficient for me, especially after I load up on toppings.

-Can't decide between the regular fries and the tasty Cajun fries?  Ask for a 'half-half' order and \"POOF!\", you'll get it!

Enjoy!

UPDATE: Gotta drop 'em to 4 stars.  The last several visits, the fries have been soggy.  Once they were even opaque in the center --- not cooked!  Ask for them EXTRA CRISPY!!"}
{"text":"They never disappoint. The employees are courteous, cordial and always smiling. A treat equal to the delicious burgers and fries.
 I visit often. Each experience is 100% satisfactory.

{"text":"The burgers I have here are typical 5 guys burgers. Of course that means they are spectacular. Fresh, juicy and perfect portion for the burger. The cajun fries are spicy and tasty even though you get to many. Wish you could get about five fries for a buck as that's about all I can eat with the huge burger. I eat here about once a week and consistency is great.  The staff is really good here- they are upbeat and friendly while not being too annoying and the high tech automated coke machine always makes the experience perfect."}

{"text":"My son and I went to Five Guys todays - my first Five Guys visit. This location is in the Arboretum shopping center - between the Wal-Mart and the Chick-fil-a. I liked that they have only a few menu items....burger, cheese burger, bacon burger etc. and I like that all of the condiments are NO extra charge. I got onion, tomato, lettuce, relish, mayo, ketchup. My son got the burger with bar-b-que sauce and said his was great. We split a small order of fries (pretty good!) and split a drink and our bill was $15+. That is a little steep for me for just a burger so even though the food was a 4-star I am only giving it 3."}
{"text":"I love this place! Although it is a bit pricey. It has a very friendly atmosphere and I kind of get a vintage burger joint kind of feel. It's really nice. And the food is so good! You get what you pay for. Especially the fries! They fill up your fries container then they dump some more fries in the bag! I really recommend you give this place a shot :)"}
{"text":"My dining partner and I ended up here for lunch because our original destination was closed. After ordering, we dove into the unlimited free peanuts.. so far so good. However, once we got into the burger and fries, our experience began to go downhill.
 
Maybe it's unfair, but I compare every burger I eat to In-N-Out. This cheeseburger just didn't measure up. It wasn't bad, but not great either. We also shared an order of the Cajun fries, which weren't anything special. The worst was right after we finished eating. My dining partner and I both had the feeling you get when you eat junk food that didn't even satisfy you, but instead leaves you feeling crappy.  

Another thing- I spent $5 for a cup of water and a small cheeseburger. I could get a cheeseburger, fries and a small drink at In-N-Out for the same price. 

Needless to say, I will not be returning to Five Guys."}

{"text":"This location was close to my hotel so I went.   The place was clean, open, and the people working there were very friendly.  You can customize your burger however you want, but the burger was nothing special at all.   It was just a very simple burger with lots of toppings.   The fries were some of the worst ever.   I don't know anyone who likes soggy fries and their always are.  I get that they are cooked fresh, but if I am going to eat an unhealthy French Fry, I want it to be crispy, crispy, crispy.   I did like their Cajun seasoning though.  1 star for he Cajun seasoning, 1 star for a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"My burger was good... Fries were good... And of course it's hard to screw up unsweet iced tea. However think twice if you want to eat cheaply... I had a little bacon cheeseburger, small fries, and a small drink. It was almost $14!!... Way too much for what I ordered.  The next time want a burger... I'll go over to showMars."}

I like that they have an option of getting a burger in a bowl or lettuce wrapped and when I tell them I have an allergy, they actually change gloves and are very cautious. I love that they only fry fresh cut fries there so I don't have to worry about particles of onion rings or added wheat ingredients. Plus, everything consistently tastes great! We come here a lot and we have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The 2 star is only for the burger (which by the way is overpriced).  Just about everything else is a 1.  If waiting next to an overflowing trash can for 15 minutes is your idea of great service, this is your place.

The music was too loud, the floor was filthy, the fries were greasy and undercooked, mushrooms come from a can (and they list them as \"grilled\", WTF!), trash cans were overflowing.  Over $20 for 2 small burgers, 2 small sodas, and 1 regular fry.  REALLY!   There has to be 10 places for a better deal and better food within 10 blocks.  And you can get a beer in most of them.

It's one and done for me.  See you at Great Dane."}
{"text":"Ok, so we came here to try Five Guys again, it has been some time since we came last.
I was shock with their prices, didn't remember being this expense..... However, we stayed and had lunch, the hamburgers and fries are good, didn't get the Wow factor, but ok. I know a while back in a food survey it said it had beat \"IN N OUT\". It's all about the taste, there's no wow factor at 5G, but a huge difference in price $$. 
The food is good, however not better than INNO....
What got me choosing INNO over 5G, Is the price, for the same order I paid almost $10 more at 5G.

Conclusion: if you're driving and INNO and 5G, are close to each, I recommend INNO, not only because of the taste but also the price.
See the pic the receipt.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Gourmet fast food as I like to call it. Five Guys has one of my favorite burgers and I am so glad they made the move out west.  Service at this location is the best I've experienced from this chain. For a juicy and tasty burger topped your way you must try Five Guys!"}
{"text":"Not impressed...I'll stick to my fave - Smashburger."}
{"text":"I am very familiar with this chain going all way back to their humble origins in the Washington D.C. area in the early 90s.  They were consistently voted the # 1 burger in the local mags down there. Although I am not immune to the allure of grilled beef on bread, I never saw what made them so great.  Although my initial pronouncement (back in the day) of 5 Guys being a post-modern Fuddruckers seems a bit dated, the sentiment still holds.  This isn't a truly better burger; it's a fresher burger - it has more options - it's bigger - all good-ish things that somehow in my mouths mind don't add up to better.  There are loads of better mom-n-pop burgers in the GTA and if you need a chain burger to feel secure, well IMHO Hero is a much better choice."}
{"text":"Kinda on the fence when it comes to 5 guys.

Been to several back east; after two visits to our local spot i feel the burgers are not quite as good as what i've had in Delaware and Florida.

The likes : great selection of toppings ( though on one visit they botched my order and forgot the onions - gotta have the onions ! ) ;  decent meat - good size, juicy but ( unlike smash burger ) - where's da salt ?!?! the peanuts ... kinda - what's the correlation of nuts and burgers ??  Service - brought the food timely.

dislikes : fries , limpy, wimpy, limpy; price; 

Overall - it ain't bad but it's doubtful i'll hit this location anytime soon - i'll occasionally hit up the 5g when they open closer to mi casa"}
{"text":"Five guys food is five guys food. It's delicious. The only reason I gave this one 3 star is the customer service. They did alright but I've had better service."}
{"text":"The spot for a greasy cheeseburger. 

Friendly staff right as you walk in,  the burgers appear hand formed and I would say the patties are a bit thicker than Culvers.  

They do give you a ton of fries and I appreciate the Cajun seasoning.  

Good late night burger joint!"}
{"text":"For the life of me, I cannot figure out what the hype is about.  I tried a burger here, and frankly, it wasn't very good.  It was dry, and the bun was rather pathetic.  The burger was (barely) one step above what I'd get at McDonald's.  Their fries were very good, I will give them that, but I don't go to a burger joint just for that.  In-n-out has better burgers, but if you want a REALLY good burger, Smashburger is the way to go."}
{"text":"I had my first taste of the latest Five Guys to creep into Toronto. First off, they could not have picked a better location. They are downtown, by a university and right by the epicentre of the downtown core. Duh, duh, duh- everyone in these area loves greasy burgers at all hours of the day. And today, I was one of those people. 

Wow, getting \"everything\" on your burger included mushroom and sauteed onions. I was excited. But note to self: the burgers don't travel too well. The bun was soggy after a five minute walk. Still the taste reminded me of In-And-Out Burger in Los Angeles, apart from the obvious texture issues. 

On the other hand, the shovel of fries was an amazing. They don't stop filling at the top of the fry sleeve... they stop when the paper bag is full. It could have been embarrassing for some to walk home with such a grease-stained baggy, but I took it as a badge of honour."}

I've been to Five Guys before in New York and Vancouver. I just remember their burgers being huge....and had peanuts everywhere in the store. Since I was just next door doing some Korean grocery shopping at Galleria, I decided to drop by for a burger.

One cute thing about Five Guys is that they have sacks of peanuts everywhere and you can eat as many as you want! I never really eat the peanuts because I know what I am waiting for (a huge burger) but my parents enjoyed it quite a bit.

Once you decide what you want, you can order it at the front and pay for them first. They either call your number or will bring it to your table.


Ordered: Bacon Cheeseburger 4/5

* 2 patty burger with bacon and cheese for $8.69
* I added with mayo, tomatoes, lettuce, grilled mushrooms, jalapeno peppers and ketchup 
* If I didn't say this before, let me say it again!! Their burgers are huge!
* I regretted ordering regular one the moment I unwrapped it
* Burger bun is soft like McDonalds and the patty is on the thinner side
* Beef patty was cooked well done but was still juicy 
* All the ingredients are super fresh and it almost tastes home made
* Seasoning was on the light side so the burger didn't feel too heavy
* I didn't attempt to eat this with hands, just gave up and ate it with my fork & knife
* Next time I think I will get the \"Little\" version


Ordered: Regular fries 4/5

* Enough to share between 3 people for $3.69
* Fries came hot and fresh right out of the fryer
* They use real potatoes (no batter) and is fried in pure peanut oil
* It reminded me of New York fries (similar in texture)
* They are so good it's hard to stop eating them
* Again, regular fries are more than enough for 3 people or more

My mom ordered Little Cheese Burger......and this is how it looked, not very little.

Summary: There are couple locations of Five Guys Burger all over Toronto, if you want a burger but not McDonalds (still so good...haha)- look for Five Guys Burger for a home-made tasting burger. Just make sure you don't have peanut allergy :)"}
{"text":"Just a burger that's all. Seems like a cheap version of in and out"}
{"text":"Food is fine.  For fast food. 
Taste good.  I think way pricy for a simple burger fries and cocacole 13$.   But. The food is fine"}
{"text":"I don't particularly enjoy the french fries, cajun or \"five guys\" style, but thats trivial considering just how good the burgers are. I get the bacon burger with mushrooms and it's pretty hard to limit myself to only one every two weeks or so. Definitely at the top of my favorite burger joints."}
{"text":"Was really hungry and ended up here.  Burger is unremarkable and fries not crisp.  Also, they don't have ranch in the building.  That's not acceptable.  

Upside:   Free peanuts!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for anyone who loves a good burger.  Choose any burger you want and pay the price of that while adding as many toppings as you please with no extra charge!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and the burger is just like any other burger but 2 times the price.Horrible."}
{"text":"Five Guys is a fun place that serves up juicy burgers with all the fixins and the fries are pretty good too.  I like the option of ordering online in advance and being able to pick up when I arrive.  That convenience factor bumps this up to 4 stars instead of 3.5 for me.  Burgers are a decent size, and they also have the option of lettuce wrap instead of bun (I'm not big on bread).  They give a good portion of fries and have classic condiment options of malt vinegar (which I am a big fan of) and ketchup for those who like to keep it simple.  I am glad this is not a place that entertains yellow cheese slime (I hate that it's even called cheese) or ranch for fries.  It keeps this place above trailer park standards lol."}
{"text":"I saw this when going to get Jamba Juice (yum) and thought I would try it. When I went in, the hairband music was blaring, I could hardly hear the order taker. I ordered a bacon cheese burger and fries. 10.00. eh, not great, not terrible. I watched as the line cooks(kinda) yelled at each other because they couldnt hear each other. They would call out order number and the customers couldnt hear them over the music and the people yelling. I decided not to eat there. I took my food and when I got in my car, I tried a fry. I spit it out. It was so greasy and full of salt I almost gagged. I called and the manager said to come back, would give my money back. No apology. Told her to try a fry, she just looked at me like I was nuts. This comes NO where close to Smashburger.. Heck, Hamburger hut may be a dive, but they beat out this place by a long shot!"}
{"text":"I didn't get a burger:( I was in the mood for bacon :()... Anyways the gentleman at register was so sweet and told me the BLT was really good, so I tried it. This was my second visit in a week because the first one was so good. I did it with cheese and fries the first time, and loved it. I decided to try it sans the fries and added jalapenos this time. Too spicy even for me so I picked them off, but delicious none the rest. The service is friendly and the guy at the counter always makes the visit very pleasant. They give you complimentary salted peanuts which are the best tasting ever. I will be back in the near future but need a break to watch the waistline. Do try the fries tho since they are known for them, they offer smaller sizes since a year ago, and it's more than plenty. This is my favorite burger or BLT place."}
{"text":"Delicious. Amazing. Incredible. What can I say? Five guys is a classic that is sure to satisfy all cravings. It is GREASY and if you're looking to feel good about yourself afterwards, then stay far away from here; however, if you're ready to indulge to the heavens, this is your place. It costs more than INO, but they're two different animals, so there's no use in comparing the two. I get the veggie burger (bun,cheese, veggies) and it's delishhhh. Their Cajun fries are out of this world! Top it with a cherry coke and boom- you have yourself a guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"another burger chain.

but i have to say, the closest northeast ohio is gonna get to a inn 'n out burger.

pretty good."}
{"text":"First and last time here. French fries were disgusting overly salty soggy. Hamburger was a mess as well. Ugh so wanted to like it here."}
{"text":"The first time I went. The Burger was great. One of the best. But, This last time. The burger was not so good. Something changed? The meat seems different."}
{"text":"It is quite an expansive place for burger but its a burger unlike any other fast food restaurants! I like coming here from time to time for a good burger especially with friends!"}
{"text":"Every one seems to rave about their burgers, their hot dogs are over the top.  The people that work there are nice and the place is spotless.  For whatever reason I disdain the fries that is why I gave them a 4 star."}
{"text":"C'est selon moi une place a burger prefere en ville.....la rapidite du service, les pommes frite faites avec des pommes de terre locales. Des cacahu√®te a volonte et la musique qui fit parfaitement avec l'ambiance. Le prix est tres raisonnable. Peut etre un petit manque d'hygiene dans le sens ou quand j'y suis allee de l'eau coulait de la machine a soda pas le fun a patauger.....mais sinon ca vaut le coup!!"}
{"text":"The service was good! The girl at the register was super nice and patient with us. The food was high quality as well, pretty good. I'll be honest though it was way too pricey! $25 for 2 burgers and fries?!? Not even some type of gourmet style just normal burgers? I'm sorry but next time I want a burger I'm going to save my money and go to in n out for double the amount of food for half the price. Nothing against this five guys location in particular, just feel like the franchise in general is very overrated for how freaking expensive it is."}
{"text":"5 guys was good as ever.  They gave us extra fries since the wait for the food was a little longer than normal - although, we weren't in a hurry so the wait wasn't bothering us.  Of course, they give you so many fries to start with that extra fries turned out to be way more than we could reasonably eat!  My husband, unable to let any fries go to waste - they are good, took one for the team and finished them up.

It seems they have also added to their menu since we were last there.  There is now a veggie sandwich and an option to order a small fries - which is good since a regular fry is too much for one person.

My kids still love the coke machine where you can select and mix your own flavors and the peanuts that you eat while you wait.  

Overall, we think 5 guys is a fun place and always enjoy a return trip."}
{"text":"We had whats called small burger but with toppings it was a large burger.  It was sloppy good burger.  This was what I was looking for and got it.  The fries were excellent. Pickles were fresh not old. I didnt mind waiting five minutes for burgers. Yes line up at 6:45 PM."}
{"text":"Rien √† voir avec Burger King ou autre McDonald!!
La musique est par contre trop forte, mais les cacahu√®tes et les bons hamburgers n'y font plus penser!!"}
{"text":"If you are a burger lover this is your place, but prepare to spend a little bit more comparing to other fast food places. Have in mind that Five Guys is indeed a high quality juicy burgers and of course endless french fries with the skin. The only thing to consider in this location is the hours that people go to this place, what I mean is this place became so popular in the area that it can be full sometimes. My recommendation is visit it after 2:00pm or in the evening hours not late than 9:30pm. They have a great costumer service, is family friendly, and of course delicious."}
{"text":"Here was my dilemma, I was across the street and wanted to eat.  I had the choice to get in my car to drive about 2 mins down the street to In-N-Out, however, I've heard sooo much about this place that I decided to walk across the street instead.

At first I was a little excited that you practically get to customize your burger with unlimited toppings, I think that was probably the best part so needless to say I was disappointed.  

I felt it was a little overpriced, I got the 'tiny/small' burger and 'tiny/small' fries, no drink , just water, and it still came out to a little over $8??? And there's no combo options whatsoever.

Now when I got my burger I was looking forward to eating it, however, with every bite, the extra ingredients kept falling out!! At first I'd put it back in then eventually I gave up and resorted to getting a fork so I could take a bite then pick up the fixins after.  It was very sloppy and messy.  Also, the patty tasted pretty bland, maybe I was just expecting a lot more since the price was above average.

The fries were on point though.  Ok, so two things good, the customization of burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Pros: For two days old they are consistent with what you would expect from Five Guys. Although line was super long, service was very quick from start to finish. Best part, the burger! Very close but slightly behind I-N-O in quality with more of a home burger taste. 

Cons: No Milkshakes! How can you sell hamburgers with no milkshakes? Fries were the typical heavy, greasy, peanut oil tasting Five Guys fries. Not a fan of Five Guys fries. No outdoor dinning. 
One man bathrooms are not conducive to 100+ diners at one time. Mushrooms are canned so no real mushroom flavor.

Overall great burger but In-N-Out still holds the best rating overall for food, quality and experience. Seems as though burger joints will be playing Ketchup (pun intended) to I-N-O for years to come or at least as long as they remain family owned, which seems that won't change soon and shouldn't."}
{"text":"Wish it wasn't so bad for me! Best fast food burger place by far! Excellent real French fries... Burgers are delicious!"}
{"text":"Easily the best burger chain I've ever eaten at. The service was not as fast as I first expected it to be, and I was gearing up for a somewhat lukewarm review. But thanks to the fresh ingredients (nothing is frozen), the first class toppings selections, and the sheer quantity of the food, I was won over easily.

These burgers are gigantic, but they're also of a much higher quality than you might think. They are wrapped in paper for a reason... these are some juicy beef patties! The burger is just fantastic, but keep napkins and your burger wrap handy. The fries are cooked in peanut oil and cut in the store, so they've got a freshness that you almost never experience at a chain. There's also malt vinegar if you're not a ketchup guy, which warmed my heart.

I did feel like I was about to give birth to a brick for the next two hours, but now I know that when I come back (and I will come back), I gotta go easy on the toppings and share my fries, because the quantity and the quality is literally too much!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff and menu. Delicious I would never go back to a normal burger joint. My first visit to a 5 guys was in Salem Oregon all I can say is WOW. Friendly out going staff and here in Vegas they were just as friendly helpful and out going."}
{"text":"The best burger I've every had and fries to boot.
Since I've had Five Guys burgers my bar has been raised and there aren't many gourmet burger joints that meet the taste and burger experience like Five Guys does.
The fries are fantastic.

The restaurant ambiance is perfect as well."}
{"text":"I've been to several burger joints in Toronto including gourmet ones but this one has them all beat.  My cheeseburger was stacked so high with all sorts of mushroom, onions and cheese topping that I ended up eating it sloppily but I. Did. Not. Care. At. All. as the taste was fantastically awesome!  It almost justifies the outrageous prices (almost but not quite).  The price is pretty much the only reason I'll come to this place twice a year.  I cannot justify spending so much on a burger, albeit the tastiest burger I've ever had."}
{"text":"Wanted to see what all of the hype was about so I ordered online for pick up.  Arrived to an unorganized place with staff not very engaged in what they were doing after waiting for eye contact at the pickup counter, it was learned that my order was lost and so I got to wait 20 minutes for my order.  Staff unapologetic and really just slinging overpriced burgers. Got 3 burgers and 3 fries was about $35.  Burgers were okay not great kind of thin, in and Out and Carls Jr better for sure.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"The first time I went to 5 guys I hated it but I'm a true believer of 2nd chances.

I ordered the double bacon cheeseburger and wasn't disappointed. I mean, nothing memorable, but a pretty decent taste for a decent price.

The service was really good and the best is the Coke machine that has tons of flavors. Got to love it!"}
{"text":"I find Five Guys to be incredibly overrated. Sure, they give you lots of french fries, but they always seem burnt or worse, soggy. Also every time I order a burger it ALWAYS has too much ketchup and mustard on it. Now, this may be a problem strictly at this location but, it is still annoying. I don't think Five Guys is awful, in fact, I still think their food is tasty but if I want consistent fast food and to save some money I'll just go to cookout instead."}
{"text":"The best burger I've every had and fries to boot.
Since I've had Five Guys burgers my bar has been raised and there aren't many gourmet burger joints that meet the taste and burger experience like Five Guys does.
The fries are fantastic.

The restaurant ambiance is perfect as well."}
{"text":"man who took my order couldnt speak english properly, assured me they had sweet potato fries even though i ended up with regular fries. burger didnt agree too well with my stomach, recommend another burger joint..."}
{"text":"They have the BEST hot dogs ever! They're smoked super BBQ style they're delicious! And the guys staff are super cool! OMG and the soda machine it's amazing as well, 150 soda choices *claps* lol."}
{"text":"For what this place is (a fast food joint) burgers do not get better than this. Before Five Guys, of course, I was a In N Out kind of guy seeing as how they make the best REAL burgers and they never fail to taste amazing, I didn't care if I had to sit in a ridiculous line. Then I tried Five Guys. Boy, was I wrong about real burgers. 
The place gives off a genuine atmosphere, the employees are really nice and are all about real american food. The wait for the food i so-so but it gives you time to get a drink from there amazing soft drink machine containing flavors of coke, sprite, dr pepper, and other beverages that you have never known existed. As for the burgers and fries? Phenomenal. One of a kind. These burgers WILL get you full and the flavors are immense. There are no fast food burgers better than this, take my word for it."}
{"text":"I was told that this place had one of the best burgers in town.
Yesterday, I waited for 56 minutes for my burger and fries...56 minutes!
And the burger was average; not the best.

I could have  a gourmet lunch in 56 minutes. 

You don't put 1 register and 3 guys behind the counter between 12 and 1.
You put 2 registers, 6 guys when it's busy.

Service was horrible. Wait was unforgivable and the burger was actually over done and very thin.

Disappointed, again!

Where is the real burger, real service? Please !!!!!"}
{"text":"Choice of toppings for your hamburger. Lots of non hamburger menu options. Drink machine is that new tech fountain & has tons of flavors. Super clean with friendly service. Ordered \"little\" hamburger & it was anything but little. Then there were the little\" fries- they come in a cup, but there was a bunch more in the bag: what a great surprise"}
{"text":"I am completely sold on this place. Second time going to a Five Guys for lunch here in the valley & loving almost everything about them. Pick your own toppings, burgers come in sizes, fried cut from fresh potatoes, posters of reviews plaster on walls from newspapers & cork boards with crayons, thumbtacks, and paper for customer reviews. Forgot to order fries with my meal & the cook said he had extra, so he let me have one small cup: what a great extra!! So, why did this location only get three stars?- It's about the food: I got my order to go. These meals are best when you eat them fresh as burgers get soggy after sitting out."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever --- Fries are so so (greasy/soggy) and too much.

Convenient, clean and fast."}
{"text":"I was outta my MIND hungry and we tried to go to Sweet Basil, Thai Spice, and even Chick-Fil-A, which were all closed on Sunday afternoon!! What?! Five Guys was the first place I saw after being screwed over by Chick-Fil-A. I'm happy that we came.

It wasn't the first time have had it, but the first time dining in, and the first time in over two years. The burger was GREAT! I'm glad I didn't get a double. The fries were excellent too, unlike any fast-food fries I've tried. Thick- cut and so greasy it stained the bag. Disgusting. And awesome.

Also, Coke Zero on tap.

Even the parents were pleased. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Little disappointed with this location. It's been over a year since we have stopped in for lunch and it will be at least another year before we come back. Prices have gone up (over 15 for burger and fries). I don't mind paying 15 bucks to eat out when they serve you but not when I'm doing all the work. They were also out of fork and spoons when I asked the manager he said they been out of stuff for at least a week and they were waiting on a truck. The place was also dead during lunch hour which is another indication of service going down hill. 

With all the other burger joints in the area we will spend our money else where."}
{"text":"I have been to Five guys in 3 different states now and I still love it. I am originally from so cal and I grew up on in and out. I only tried 5 guys because Obama went...and I ended up falling in love it. Their burgers have a lot more flavor and are just great. I actually prefer in and outs fries though. Anyways, I will keep coming here."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but we have been here 3 times and every single time our order is completely wrong. Unfortunately all were to go orders so there wasn't much we could do it's just frustrating that everytime we go , simple things can't be executed properly especially when it's your job."}
{"text":"To be fair, my review is based on a take out order, which would explain the soggy buns because they looked perfect as I watched them make my burger.

I came here during my lunch break as I needed something quick and The staff here work efficiently to make sure everyone gets their burger fast! I probably only waited five minutes before mine was ready. 

That said, Five Guys isn't what you would expect at gourmet burger joints like Burger Priest or P&L so the toppings are quite basic. So, if you're one who enjoys classic burgers, this may be the place for you. 

By the time I got back to my office and unwrapped my burger from the ton foil, the buns were soggy already, but the ingredients tasted very fresh! It all ends up the same in my stomach anyway.. I'll be back next time to dine in!"}
{"text":"Great food as usual but tonight was the first time ever that I've left 5 guys STILL HUNGRY! 
I remember when they used to give you so many French fries that you'd have to tear your bag apart just to get your burger out! Awesome! 
I mean for the price of a \"meal\", a mountain of fries helps my wallet forget the pain. 
This time, I only got a small cup full of fries. No \"extra\". Definitely not worth $5!!! 
Idk if this is the new model for 5 guys... to tone down the fries but not the price, but I don't like it."}
{"text":"Ive been to this location twice now for late lunch/early dinner 2:30 pm. Was there today. Fresh meat. Fresh ingredients. Soft yummy bun and KILLER fries. Took my bag home and paired with a fresh margarita. HEAVEN after a great day of business activity. Oh, and cute staff with great attitudes. Nice job, guys! Way to cook. You should train other restaurants."}
{"text":"About time I've tried this place.

So I walk in to the most unexpected sight. A crowded, noisy mess with giant bags of potatoes and boxes containing peanuts at the front door. I'm still confused over why there's so many peanuts, but moving on, I just get in line. 

The menu is fairly basic, which from my perspective is a good thing! Since I can be quite picky when it comes to burger toppings, it's very convenient for the burger to come plain and just let them know which toppings you would like afterward (at no extra charge). What can I say? I'm a mayonnaise hating machine who believes that putting cheeses like Swiss or Monterrey Jack on a burger is blasphemy, so it gets quite frustrating having to constantly explain that over and over again at other burger joints. 

I was a bit worried about the price. $12.08 for burgers, fries and a drink isn't expensive, but that's not exactly my idea of a deal either, not at a fast food restaurant at least. After finishing the meal however, I can say that it was totally worth it, even if it's something a poor college student can't eat on a regular basis. 

I ordered a regular cheeseburger with grilled onions, ketchup, mustard and lettuce. The thing was HUGE. I just loved how it was a double cheeseburger as well, even though the menu didn't say so. Hate to jump on the comparison bandwagon, but it really reminded me of In-N-Out, just much bigger, juicier, sesame seeds on the bun and no yummy special sauce. The part that most reminded me of In-N-Out was how when you get close to finishing the burger, the meat, cheese and toppings start to outweigh the bun. Still too soon to say which one I prefer though. 

The fries were also a surprise. I can be quite a weirdo when it comes to fries. As someone who can appreciate crispy fries and soggy fries, I was quite impressed with the balance of sogginess and crisp. They also overload you on them. They already come in a cup to begin with, and looking behind the counter, it appears the cup is just thrown in there which leads to the bag being overloaded with fries in addition to the cup. And this was the regular sized cup! There was enough of those things for two people.

One thing I really had fun with is the soda fountain. It's futuristic in the sense that it works on a touchscreen which dispenses every drink through the same sprout, but old-fashioned in the sense of \"syrup.\" Like those old-timey soda fountains you hear about, it offers several bases (such as Coca-Cola, Sprite, Mello Yello, etc...) that you can choose to make all sorts of concoctions from thanks to the flavored syrups (such as Peach, Orange, Cherry, Vanilla, etc...). Peach Sprite in particular is VERY good. 

As for the ambiance of the place? I can't say I cared for it. It was so ridiculously loud in there, you basically had to yell if you wanted to talk to someone. And in spite of the large space the restaurant is in it still felt a little bit too crowded. 

The Final Verdict:

Pros:
Big, juicy, delicious burgers.
The \"create-your-own\" type menu.
A tad steep, but totally worth it for what you get.
Exceptional fries, of which you're given much more than enough of them.
The out of the ordinary soda fountain. 

Cons:
VERY noisy. Not the type of place to have any kind of meetup (which is what I was here for in the first place), that's for sure.
Cramped layout of the restaurant. 

WTF?:
What's with all of the peanuts?

Suggestions: The kitchen should be semi-closed off from the rest of the restaurant. That would probably help out with the noise problem A LOT.

Would I return? In spite of my gripe about how hectic the ambiance of the place feels, yes."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome! I love burgers and I love these burgers! Service is good place is clean and did I say the burgers rock!"}
{"text":"My first time there today for lunch with colleagues; and it will not be my last! Excellent service. Very fast and efficient and polite, piping hot fries cut fresh daily, delicious burgers, vinegar available which is rare in the USA I find, very cool touch screen soda dispenser, and lots of food for the money. The \"little\" size burgers should be enough for anyone; and as every other person on here has stated the regular fries is plenty for 2 people. I have yet to try the \"In-an-Out\" joints on the West Coast (really want to though!); so i'll keep my 5 stars for when I experience the \"perfect\" burger & fries! Am enjoying the search though I will admit! Would recommend this location to anyone looking for a nice atmosphere (bit loud during lunch though) and a very satisfying meal."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a no-frills hamburger joint, Five Guys is the place for you. Food is wrapped in foil and shoved into a plain paper bag. The thin napkins look like a Costco special. And the only brand labeling appears to be on the cups.

But what about the food? Meh.

I met a friend for lunch, and it was the first visit for both of us. We each had a \"little cheeseburger,\" and she got an order of fries. First off, the \"little\" part is a misnomer; that was one big burger! I got mine wrapped in lettuce (the low-carb option) with onions, pickles, tomatoes, and jalapenos. It was a pretty good burger, but I'm not sure it was worth $5. I didn't try any of my friend's fries (they didn't look appealing to me; kinda limp), but I did snack on some of the in-shell peanuts they offered. A nice touch, I might add.

This location has a Coke machine that gives you hundreds of options, depending on what buttons you hit. A nifty gimmick that might warrant the $2.39 drink price, but I just wanted an iced tea. At least they offer free refills, so I guess I got my money's worth there.

Service was a bit slow, but everything was made to order, so I had no problem with that. And unlike some fast-food joints, this place was quiet enough that we could actually carry on a conversation while we waited for our food.

All in all, I appreciate the variety of toppings, the free peanuts, and the fact that you can get your burgers wrapped in lettuce if you prefer. But next time I'll go to In-N-Out: Better burgers and a better price!"}
{"text":"Love love love the burgers!!!

We don't have a Five Guys locally so when we found one on our trip to Madison, we had to stop in!  It was great!!  

It's got the typical \"burger joint\" feel to it... crazy loud, though!  The burgers are amazing, however the fries leave a lot to be desired.  

This particular Five Guys is located right on State Street which adds to the appeal; perfect for stopping in while doing some (window) shopping, taking in some local acts or just cruising around.  It's a perfect setting.

We loved our Five Guys burgers!!"}
{"text":"A good business is like a good meal. You start out with the right ingredients: kind employees who are hard-working add in foods made with fresh, basic, hand cut toppings and fresh cut fries and you get the BEST there is to offer. This review is less about the food (which in my opinion is burger perfection) and more about the service. Every time I walk into five guys on howe road I am greeted with a smile, The employees are patient kind and hard-working. It's no wonder the restaurant is always busy, but, they work so hard the wait is hardly ever too long. I will continue to go back repeatedly and you should too."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and helpful. They cheerfully remade my BLT after I forgot to mention that I did not want any mayo. The BLT had lots of bacon."}
{"text":"This is an unfair review based on pricing and the menu.  More of a heads up.

I hear good things about this place, especially for a chain, so I decided to stop by for lunch.

Unfortunatly, I also decided to leave before I ordered.

Two reasons.  First is price.  A plain burger is $4.  With cheese and goodies you are running up towards $6, which doesn't include fries.  All in all you are looking at $10 - $12 for a \"combo\" meal which is something they don't offer.

I like to eat so I was looking for some sort of double but I didn't see one on the menu.

What I did see (second reason coming up...) is that they cook all meat WELL DONE.

If I'm going to spend that much for a burger and fries I would like to be able to order it how a burger should be cooked (which is meduim or medium rare if you didn't already know).

Recommend \"The Grind\" or \"Delux\", both a stones throw away, and both do burgers right.  For a burger and fries, either will run you about the same amount if you forgo the tea and get water.  Both are Local to boot.

There's my two cents."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic the food is always good and fresh cashiers are friendly if you ate looking for a good burger this is the place to go I highly recommend the bacon burger and Lil fry it is the bomb!"}
{"text":"I can't justify the pricing to ever want to make a return visit. I would rather smaller portions then having to pay so much for a burger and fries.

 You purchase your burger and fries separate, i remember it being about $15 total. There are no combos. The food is good, they give out way more fires then you need and you can get free peanuts if they actually put them out like they are supposed to. But... seriously, there are way better restaurants to eat at for that kind of money. And we have great Canadian/Toronto based burger joints like Burger's Priest anyways.

Five Guys inspired me to go to my local butcher and make my own burgers at home. I also think the extra fries they gave me were old anyways since half them were crispy and the other half were kind of soggy."}
{"text":"Best burger, .... ever

The fare are simple, here. Burgers without without cheese, a dozen toppings and sauces to choose from. Two kinds of fries, regular or Cajun. That's it.
But let me tell you... Superior fresh ingredients, prepared on demand, reasonably priced.

That's fast food but not junk food. The way a burger should taste, every time."}
{"text":"Best \"quick\" burger out there!  Love the soft but minimal bun.  Burger reminds me of Burger King but good."}
{"text":"Great customer service every time I come here! Couple that with delicious burgers and milkshakes, and I'm in heaven! As long as these employees are here, I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Portions for the fries are absolutely ridiculous. Usually split one between 2-3 people. Burgers are no nonsense and delicious. I think they are far, far superior to Hero, as mentioned in the other review."}
{"text":"The only reason I was lured into this joint is because a twelve year old cousin suggested it had the best burgers around. Hey, kids picky and brutally honest and what did I have to loss? Brownie points were rewarded to many aspects of this experience, however, I wasn't exactly impressed with the main reason of my visit- the burger.

When I entered Five Guys I was immediately enthralled by the repetition of red and white, everywhere. There are potato sacks that are strategically placed to organize an efficient line that weaves through all the awards on the walls. When I finally reached the menu, I felt a sense of relief. It was pure and simple. A burger, a cheese burger, hot dog etc... all of these could be ordered on a smaller size as well (which is really not that small). I loved the fact that the menu was simple, plain text and straight forward. It kept to the basics 

The staff was extremely friendly and when we wanted to change our small hamburger for a large, it was done without charge. Nice guy.

When my burger arrived, my bun was extremely soggy and lacked all essential bread qualities. The meat though, was perfect. I was tempted to just take it out of the bun and eat it fork and knife style. It was fresh, not fatty and didn't overwhelm my taste buds with excess salt. The cajun fries, mmm, mmm...Delicious!!!! Thick, full body of potato flavor with perfect seasoning! 

Just a suggestion. When ordering fries, eat them on location. When we arrived home the paper bags was soaked with grease stains and turned everyone's stomachs in the opposite direction.

It has a simple menu, fresh meat and to die for fries."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I went here to eat.  Although, I thought the service was fairly decent, the prices were more than I thought the food was worth. Greasy, pre frozen patties at sit down restaurant prices.  Their claim to fame is apparently their amazing fries. However, I did not find their fries very good the night we went. I was a little disappointed, especially considering the price was almost $50 for 3 people. 
With amazing restaurants in the area at comprable prices, I don't feel like I'll be  going back there anytime soon"}
{"text":"Not bad.. not like in and out...  good burgers, kinda pricey.. the fries werent that great either, but I do find myself craving another one of their burgers."}
{"text":"I must admit I was shocked by the service we received at this location.  In the best way possible, I was hesitant to go inside when i noticed tons of Elementary/middle school kids were piling in. However we still decided to go in. I was pleasantly greeted by what had to have been the owner who took our order immediately instead of having to wait behind all the kids. The gentlemen told the kids to be careful because we had a baby with us and to watch out. Our order was brought to us, by the same person that seemed to be the owner instead of just calling our number out and made it very personable by doing  so. Coming from a quick serve burger place joint this place had EXCELLENT customer service!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and just had the chance to write a review now.   Had the bacon cheeseburger.  Toppings all the way.  Burgers are good!  I would say top 10 in the city.  Goody's diner was the best joint to go to.  Too bad it's no longer around.  Fries were good.  Get a cup of fries then they put another scoop into the paper bag.  A order of fries is good to share for 2-3.  If you have a severe peanut allergy I suggest you don't go there.   Many reviews have been done already but the best by far is Daym drops on youtube. (Five guys burgers and fries review) Look it up, he's hilarious!"}
{"text":"I love their burgers. As far as fast food burger joints go, they're one of the absolute best in the Pittsburgh region. They're very consistent from restaurant to restaurant as well.

Their toppings are free and always fresh in my experience. I typically go with lettuce, tomato, pickle, grilled onion, and ketchup/mustard. Fries are also great and I love that they typically have vinegar available.

My biggest gripe? Price. I always order the \"little\" cheeseburger and \"little\" fry which basically means one party in the burger and the smallest fry available. Yet, when I do it costs $12.50 for a meal with a drink. I can basically eat at BRGR or Burgatory for this price. Ideally they would come up with a combo meal so that fries/drink do t add $5-6 to your order."}
{"text":"Ok burgers, Fries are ok as well but everything is just too dang greasy!"}
{"text":"There is a reason they were voted best burgers in America.  I don't eat burgers often, but when I do this is the place to get satisfied.  Fresh, juicy, and with that fresh off the grill taste.  They do one thing and one thing only... make great burgers and fries.  Friendly and efficient, Five Guys has the winning formula."}
{"text":"I went today for lunch, hoping to experience the same burger bliss I experienced on my last outing here. Alas, it was not to be. The burger (again I got the single patty little burger) was dry. There were actually dry crunchy bits on the circumference of the patty. I'm all about the char, but this was beyond char. This was a dry, abused patty. 

I was bewildered given the lovely juiciness that I experienced the first time I came here. How could things have gone so wrong? Oh, ho! I winkled out the answer to that mystery as I was leaving. I witnessed the tall blond girl commit a crime against burgerkind that should not be borne by any burger-loving citizen. She had her spatula on top of a burger patty and she was leaning her weight into it. Squeezing out all the luscious beef juices with what appeared to be ferocious and great enthusiasm. 

What the devil, blond girl! What did that burger patty ever do to you? I  understand smashing the patty into the griddle to get a good char, but once you get that initial adherence, you ease off. There was no easing off here. I don't know whether to assign malicious intent or ignorance to her actions, but she was laying into the patty like it was a snitch and she was the mob enforcer. 

And the fries, those lovely perfectly seasoned fries of my last visit, were also subpar on this visit. They were slightly limp and lacked appropriate seasoning. 

Consistency is key, people. What can I expect next time? Burger nirvana or burger heartache. I'll certainly think twice about placing my order if I see that blond girl at the grill again."}
{"text":"I came here a couple days ago to grab a burger. I didn't bother with fries, I just wanted a slab of meat on a bun. I went for the regular burger (two patties) and it was awesome. Juicy, well seasoned, hot, soft bun, delicious pickles. They went a bit lighter on the toppings than the Woodbridge location usually does, but it was fine since the patties were so juicy and flavourful. I inhaled that sucker. Mmm. I'm having a flashback to that burger. I wish every burger I ordered from every burger joint were as juicy and delicious as that one.

Also, very great service. The dudes who were working there were very polite and efficient and clearly know how to put together an exceptional burger."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. This place is pretty busy and not the quickest, so be prepared to wait a while if there's a line up. 

Ordered the burger and cajun fries. Ugh. Just get the regular fries. The cajun fries are too much. So overwhelmingly chili-powdered up. The burger was reliably good. Great amount of toppings. This location does not skimp. 

The music was crazy loud and talking was hard to do because of it. The music was especially  crazy loud in the washroom and I felt like my ear drums were in danger. Maybe they do this to discourage bathroom lingering. I don't know. It was very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This was a disappointing Five Guys experience, I'm sad to say. I stopped by yesterday to grab a burger. It was almost 8PM, so they weren't too busy. I waited far too long for my order given that they weren't slammed with customers. And, to add insult to injury, my burger was super dry. The driest burger I've ever had from a Five Guys. It was also barely seasoned. The only thing I could taste were my raw onions (too many were placed on this dry patty). 

Not sure whether this is a typical experience for this location because I've never been here before, but it was certainly disheartening."}
{"text":"The burger was good. The fries were ok. No one comes close to Nathan's fries. It is kind of pricey. You do get a lot of food for the money. It is very noisy. Not sure I would make a special trip to go back."}
{"text":"Great for a greasy burger and French fries. One of those foods that are so good going down but you pay for after. Grilled mushrooms and onions are top notch and I love the fact that they use raw jalape√±os rather than pickled. The best part about this place is that they have the friendliest and most pleasant staff of any place I've ever been to."}
{"text":"The cajun fries are outstanding and delicious this was my first time visiting this restaurant ill definitely be back to try the burgers on my next visit. The staff is super friendly and very helpful 5 stars +"}
{"text":"The food is ok, average. Not something wow but not bad either. The place is clean though, the restrooms are clean and not smelly, and the tables are clean, too. The staff is friendly and welcoming. So 5 for the place in general, 3 for food, 4 in total. Would check that place in other state since different suppliers provide with different, let's say, buns, and that would affect the whole thing."}
{"text":"if you want a plethora of well seasoned and fried fries and a huge freakin greasy burger come here now! i didnt know what i wanted to eat so i walked over to the epicenter. last time i had 5 guys (twss) was in dallas about a year ago and it was kinda unmemorable. this time it was a diff story all together and was more than memorable. as i carried by greasy brown bag walking down the street i saw pedestrians eyes glance towards down the grease stain in lust or curiosity. i killed the meal and will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent service at this location. Some of the best service & experience I've seen in the area. Food is always fast, however they are still able to maintain the freshness and taste most places do not. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Best place for a value better burger.  Two small burgers and one regular fries will serve two big appetites.  The hand cut fries are the best. They come from yesterday's generation.  Not for the diet and health conscious. Peanuts while you wait."}
{"text":"Finally, there is a 5 guys in my neighborhood. This is one of my favorite  fast food franchise. 

I have been a huge fans of 5 guys, and I'd always have it when I am south of the border. 

The Canadian five guys are similar to the ones in US. They are always generous with their toppings, every topping is free, peanuts are free as well, and fries are over the tops. 2 adults can share 1 regular fries IMO. I personally like the Cajun fries without salt.

However, the wait was LONG, it took us about 15 min to get the 2 burgers and the taste is slightly different than what i had in the states. I would give the food a 3-star as our burgers were too dry that they crumbled. I mentioned that to the grill-man on my way out, and he did his very best to make sure i am satisfy even I said it's not necessary. I will definitely give them a 5-star for customer service and give them another try next time."}
{"text":"Best burger place there is. Very friendly staff and food comes out fast. Burgers and hotdogs are amazing! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We got everything we ordered correctly. The fries were super fresh and we have tons of leftovers of them. The little burger is still a big burger, so don't order too big! Staff was friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Everything made to order. Fresh & hot. Free peanuts. Great music.  I give it only 3 stars because of the price. $7 hamburger $3 small fry $2.50 small drink."}
{"text":"By far, the best chain restaurant hamburger. They do one thing, with the exception of hot dogs, and do it well. Hope they stick to that philosophy. Fast and friendly service! A defenite must for burger lovers!"}
{"text":"Alright food. Very pricey .. when I asked the order taker what was on their burger he replied with \"everything?\" Making me seem as if I was dumb and continued to do so when I asked him more questions because it was my first time there."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this place. Burgers are really good. But I still love fatburger more =)"}
{"text":"Burger and fries.  Pretty much the All American meal.  There are tons of places that serve this  delicious combo, so we decided to give Five Guys a try.  We tried this place on a Sunday.  The place was really simple, red and white colors and in a open space.  Things you'll notice are the big bags of potatoes laying around and the peanuts that you can nibble on before you get your food.  The menu is pretty basic.  Burgers, hot dogs and fries.  Just like most reviews I've read, the prices are high for a burger joint.  We ordered two bacon cheeseburgers with everything, one medium Cajun fries and one drink and the total bill was close to 30 bucks.  That's really expensive, especially for sharing a drink and the fries.  The food was good though.  The burgers had a nice char and the ingredients were fresh.  The amount of fries they give you is ridiculous.  When I picked up the bag, I noticed they piled on the fries and we literally couldn't even finish a 1/3 of the fries that they served.  

Overall, the meal was pretty good, nothing spectacular though.  I still prefer In and Out over this place and it would be a lot cheaper as well.  The employees were friendly and the place was really clean.  Overall no complaints, but their prices are a little high for your standard burger joint.

I would recommend this place for a decent burger, but prepare to spend a little more though."}
{"text":"Just went to lunch there with friends. It is right next to the nail salon I go to. The burgers are so great. They have a delicious veggie burgers and I'm picky on my veggie burgers. The fries are superb as well as the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, it's a decent burger place with better than average fries. 

Service here is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Not a good place if you have peanut allergies! :)

I didn't know anything about Five Guys before I wandered in. It's a homey feel, with their sacks of potatoes lining the \"order here\" area. You can grab peanuts while you wait. 

The steak-cut fries are cooked in peanut oil and are amazing. Toppings are free, no avocado though. The burgers were a little messy giving it a homemade feel, but so good. Coke products (yay!).

It's definitely an experience to eat here, but I was glad I discovered it. I would love to go back anytime.

The service at this location did a fine job. There wasn't many people in there when we went so it was hard to tell if they were actually quick or not but they were certainly friendly and our food was put together well."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Good Fries. Snacks while you are waiting. I would not go if you have a peanut allergy."}
{"text":"An alright burger joint with peanuts galore.  They use peanut oil for everything. I ordered a hamburger, reg Cajun fries, and reg drink, totaling at $10. 

Result, I got a burger with double hand made patties with onions mushrooms pickles etc sandwiched with a sesame seeded set of buns. Reminds me of well crafted homemade burger. It was good but for the price in and out burgers knocks five guys out of the competition. Delicious regardless and I'd eat again."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time coming to this specific location (closer) went tonight (11-5 around 9 pm) and I must say the people that work here are probably the nicest people I've ever met. The food is top quality and they're extremely friendly. I will recommend this location to friends and you reading this review yourself. Will be coming back again, and again. 8)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars would be more appropriate.  Menu is limited so make sure the people who are going with you like burgers.  The burgers are descent and the buns are tasty but they aren't something to crave.   I was expecting the prices to be lower and this will deter me from going often as a 99 cent Jr bacon cheeseburger can give me my quick fix.  The fries are nice and crispy and will be the reason i continue to go back."}
{"text":"I literally haven't eaten beef in 24 years. Really.  Many times friends and family have tried to convince me to 'just eat a burger'.  I'm from the Midwest for gosh sake.  For whatever reason, I decided tonight was the night and 5 Guys was the place.  

This was one pretty damn good burger.  Got exactly what I wanted and the fries were great too. 

I have to admit I was afraid to try it but this burger, I would eat again...  Maybe I won't wait another 24 years though..."}
{"text":"Me and my partner agreed.  Nothing special.  Not worth the price.  Don't waste your money to satisfy your curiosity, you will regret it.  I did."}
{"text":"Haven't tried a give guys in years... Walked in and it's kinda expensive for a fast food place.  Wasn't impressed.  I'll take Smash Burger any day over five guys.... Or In N Out.  Sorry Five Guy's, we won't be back.  Service was good, but took a bit to get our food."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with friends and on dates with the wife.  Each time the cashier is extremely friendly and helpful and our order is accurate.  Five Guys ALWAYS make a delicious burger, and we love coming, even if it's not so great on the cholesterol. There is always ample seating, and they have one of the cool customize-your-drink Coke machines.  I'm happy with the service and quality at this location and definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Things I know about Five Guys:

1. They displaced In & Out on Zagats;
2. According to my husband, one order of fries can feed three people;
3. According to a good friend (who shall remain anonymous) \"Yeah, it's good, but I can eat at In & Out for half the price.\"

I agree with all three. 

I went to the food court for lunch after a fine time at Nordstrom with the express desire to have a chicken caesar at Ranch One Chicken, but they were gone (I don't get to this mall very often). So, after looking around I decided to try Five Guys to see what all the hype was about. When I left, I felt robbed.

Yeah, the food was fine. Not brilliant by burger standards, but fine. I threw away about half the fries because, generous though the serving was, I was by myself and didn't need to feed three people. They also had an incredibly cool soda machine with loads of flavors but it was on the seltzery side. And throughout the afternoon I couldn't shake my frustration over the amount of money I'd spent.

If I want to spend that kind of money, I'll go to Fez."}
{"text":"It's official... We are done going to this location. We went back to this location last week. We didn't have any burgers fall through the bag this time (see previous post). However two of our three burgers were prepared incorrectly. We ordered online again to pick up and were there probably five minutes after the online ordering system said the food would be done, and they still had not started preparing the food...there were two other customer's in the store, so they weren't slammed. Just disappointing. To clarify, I am not done ordering at Five Guys, but will not order from this particular location again."}
{"text":"It was okay...

more topping choices, but no better than In and Out Burger. Twice as expensive. The fries were unique but i didn't care for them too much. It was cold and loud inside. Meh whatever."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Five Guys, I wonder what their hot dog and grilled cheese sandwich taste like.  But the cheeseburger always ends up winning the fight in my head, and I always end up ordering that...until now.

This time I ordered both the grilled cheese sandwich and the hot dog. I may have a problem with self control...but that's a different topic.  Both these items can be topped with all the same toppings as the burgers. The grilled cheese is made with two inside-out burger buns with the sliced cheese in the middle.  The hot dog is a large-sized wiener, made out of the usual miscellaneous meat mixture, bigger than the normal grocery store dogs but I don't think quite yet a foot long, and they cut it in half on the grill.  They both taste as you would expect: yummy but nothing groundbreaking. Although I do think the inside-out burger buns on the grilled cheese is an ingenious idea.

So if you've been wondering what the grilled cheese or hot dog are like, there's your answer.  I have a feeling not too many other people wonder that, because they screwed up my order while they were cooking it and it took extra long for me to get mine.  They were nice about it though and compensated by giving me a free drink, without me even asking.  I love Five Guys."}
{"text":"This five guys location is great! Not too busy and the employees are always so friendly! also the food is great! There's something for everybody on the menu. A little on the expensive side but certainly worth it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about.  i tried a regular burger and fries.  The regular burger is a double burger (which was surprising), more meat than i can handle.  The patties are tasteless, the toppings make it a bit better.  The fries are OK.  They try to be a bit healthier and use peanut oil but I can't help but think how limiting this is to everyone allergic to peanuts out there.  They also have a huge bin of peanuts when you walk in so you can grab some and snack while waiting for your food.  There's gotta be another alternative to peanut oil!"}
{"text":"Burgers were pretty good, surely a large meal. All the food is al a carte, so you do not get your burger with fry's, they are extra. I paid roughly $11 for a cheeseburger, fries, and drink. My friend paid roughly $8 for his cheeseburger and drink. The fries can easily be shared between two people as it was way more than I could eat, in fact two of us actually ended up throwing away half the fries, there were so many. They have a fairly decent choice of toppings, the typical lettuce, onion, tomato, and options for grilled onions, jalapenos, and a couple others at no extra charge. The price may be a bit high for a fast-food joint, but rest assured you'll be getting your fill."}
{"text":"I didn't think these reviews were being very nice... but to be fair, when I dined at this restaurant the dining area was a disaster. Garbage everywhere and the tables were not cleaned. 

Besides the look of the place, the food was decent. A bit pricey for fast food, but my burger was excellent and the regular fries were just enough for 2 hungry people after shopping!"}
{"text":"Double Cheeseburger with Cajun Fries is something I crave weekly.  I can't get enough of this place.  All the toppings you want and an extra scoop of cajun fries thrown on top!  It's absolutely worth the price!!!"}
{"text":"My son loves loves loves this place, he's 10 years old. Begs me to take him every chance. My daughter, 12, does not like it at all, begs me to get her in&out or mcdonalds. I'll take 5 guys over any fast food no question. My son gets an adult size hamburger with lettuce tomato and ketchup. I get the cheeseburger all-the-way plus jalapeno.  Mmmm, the japs are fresh, not pickled, and that makes the burger, IMO. Super messy and greasy, and so good I usually eat the whole thing without putting it down. Then, still hungry, munch on fries. By the way, a small fry is plenty for 2 or 3 people, and the fries are super good, made from fresh potatoes. My only complaint is overpriced and a little too greasy. It doesn't seem healthy its so greasy, but boy does it taste great. My 10 year old son asks for a second burger each time, and I always say no, of course, because they're like $8 each. When you see the burger, its huge, and hard to imagine it wouldn't fill you up. I don't know how I'm still hungry after.  Probably because it tastes so good you eat in in like 60s and your stomach hasn't told your brain you're full yet."}
{"text":"Living in Las Vegas, you hear a TON of people wanting to compare Five Guys with In-N-Out.  They are both of a higher standard than the normal fast food burger-joint.  My opinion?

Burger = Still goes to In-N-Out.  That being said, Five Guys has a really tasty (and HUGE) burger.  Their standard burger is actually a double-burger.  One of my favorite toppings on a burger is grilled onions.  I don't know what they do differently, but theirs just don't have the same caramelized... \"goodness\" that In-N-Out has.  That being said, if you order a Bacon burger/cheeseburger you will get a LOT of bacon, and it is crispy and delicious.  The burger is a solid 7/10.

And now, the reason you WANT to go to Five Guys...

Fries = Five Guys by a MILE.  I \"like\" In-N-Out's fries.  They are a strong 5-6 out of 10 in my book.  The burgers are magical, the fries... eh.  I've had a LOT better.  Five Guys fries are the reason to eat there.  Not only are they delicious, but even with a small order, you get a TON of them.  They are fresh-cut (yes, I know In-N-Out's are as well, but it's a different cut with a different flavor) and seasoned just right.

The fries will be the reason I go back, and I'll have a pretty-good burger with them while I'm at it."}
{"text":"Decent quick food for when you're on the go. The fries rock and the shakes are okay. A small step above fast food."}
{"text":"Dudes LOVE Five Guys. 

I'm not in love with this place, but when my husband suggests it, I'm in. He, on the other hand, is completely enamored with Five Guys. I knew some dudes in high school that were also crazy about it. Dudes love Five Guys. Simple. 

For a burger chain, this is pretty good. The burgers are delicious and the range of toppings is great. For some reason I feel better eating this than most chains or fast food, but the bags covered in grease tell me I shouldn't feel too good at all...but HEY GREASE IS DELICIOUS. The fries are tasty, too, making for a great burger+fry experience. 

I've never had any problems with the service or food at this location. A+."}
{"text":"I heard they were good so I went in to the Five Guys on Chandler Blvd. in Chandler, AZ. My fries were a soggy mess so I asked for extra crispy and not only did they refuse to cook them extra crispy but the manager was beyond rude about it! Me nor my family will ever eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"Almost a fan.
 My friend brought me here claiming these are the best burgers in town. I've been to other five guys in town and always thought they were ok but not the greatest, five guys is on my \"I don't mind going if my friends want to go there\" list. We placed our order, got a number and grabbed some complimentary peanuts while we waited for our number to be called. 
  Is hard to write a review about this place without comparing it to In N Out burger when everything reminds me of it especially the red and white checkered tile that is so much of an In N Out trademark. Here at five guys the burgers are huge and you get so many choices for toppings but no matter what combinations I've tried I always end up with an ok burger. The fries are some of the best I've tried, even better than In N Out but on the burgers In N Out takes the prize.
  Employees are very friendly here, they help you with the menu and all the choices you have and when I tried to order two orders of fries she told me that one order would actually be enough for two people, when we finished eating we still had some fries left! 
  They also have those new freestyle soda machines with more than 100 soda flavors, I'll provably be back if friends decide to stop here but with more choices in vegas for good burgers than their soda machine has to offer there's really not many reasons that would bring me back to this place.....ok there's a few...but they're just peanuts.

Three and a half stars."}
{"text":"Over-priced ($15 for a burger, fries & a coke? WTF!!!!!) - definitely over-hyped - and I felt sooooo gross afterwards.  I love burgers, and anyone giving this a high rating doesn't know what a good burger is."}
{"text":"The food was what you expect but the Arctic like temperature was enough to drive us outside.  Management missed the sense of comfort and should be criticized for slacking off.  For a beautiful summer day one does not need to be subjected to a frigid winter interior."}
{"text":"Burgers were tepid (cool), dry, no milk for kids,  no shakes, no toppings as requested,  no mustard.   Crowded,  disorganized, messy.   Service out of order,  that is they were serving number 30 when we were standings there with others with 20's."}
{"text":"Prices are steep and there are better burgers to be had out there. I've been to Five Guys joints a couple times and come away thinking the same thing everytime - I want In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Ordered a little cheeseburger ($5.69), as the scent wafting from their storefront was really inviting.  The wait was slightly annoying, but the gentleman handling the order call-out was on top of things.  A little loud though!

Once unwrapped from its foil, the burger itself was cooked to be nice and juicy but have a lovely crisp \"crust\" on the edges.  The amount of ketchup was thorough and the cheese was nice and gooey.  The bun seems to have been given a slight attempt at toasting too, with some crisp edges.  Too bad the bun was smushed (why do fast food places always do that?)...

Overall, while the atmosphere inside the restaurant is that of a louder fast food joint, their food quality is quite high for the pice, and I'd eat it again."}
{"text":"Their burgers are really good, as well as the Cajun fries. The way they make their fries are unique to five guys. The only thing I would mention is the price for a burger and fries will run you about $12.xx. Other than that, it's great."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It's a step up from fast food burgers which always leave me with regret.  I like all the topping choices (fresh jalapeno!) and the although it isn't a pretty room it does the job.  The bun is fresh and meat is grilled perfectly.  Pass on the cajun fries - they are not the best.  

The regular burger selections have two patties and the \"little\" has one.  Also has pretty good hot dogs and for the veg heads a veggie sandwich or grilled cheese.  And speaking of cheese...the kitchen crews sometimes breaks out in song.  

Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"All 5 Guys are yum. The staff was helpful, the restaurant clean & the burgers juicey. Can't ask for much more from a burger place can ya?"}
{"text":"A visit to 5 Guys is always F -U- N !  Its just a great vibe.  Let's start with how clean the establishment is.    Every single visit..  clean and spotless tables, condiment/pop area and even the restrooms!   Ordering is a breeze - not much to the menu but this is a good thing. The \"little\" burger is enough for me and even the small fries.  Orders never take longer than a few minutes and always are accurate.  The staff.. friendly and courteous every time!  After I place my order I really enjoy the viewing the selection of beverages they have - low calorie-no caffeine - fruit flavored etc.  There are beverages I have never even heard of!  Then grab a few complimentary peanuts and enjoy those and by then my order is up!! 

The burgers are delicious and always consistent.   I love a good burger.. and Five Guys - no doubt has \"mighty tasty burgers\".   Thanks Five Guys."}
{"text":"Its a burger joint. Theres not much you can do to make it more exciting unless its kobe or wagyu beef they use.  Friendly staff, free peanuts a ton of soggy fries tasty but not for me.  Its good for a first decent cheap date hehe"}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance, great speedy service. Gave us two burgers for free because they wanted us to do well in our lacrosse tournament. Caring workers at this joint!!"}
{"text":"This is my 4th time here and I've been wanting to review this place. I'm actually eating and writing this at the same time.

Customer service is fine and was not too busy. 

Ordered the bacon cheese burger (single patty). The burger reminds me of a homemade Wendy's burger. It tasted fine, but what I don't understand is, why does the burger always comes squished & sort of soggy?

The fries, I had to wait for them to make, so I got them fresh! Tasted dry and like card board. But I got a bag full!

Overall not bad, a little over rated!!"}
{"text":"I have reviewed other Five Guys locations throughout the USA.  This one is the same experience I have had at them all, good food and great service.

I am always impressed and pleased with a chain restaurant that truly cares about quality food and the customer experience."}
{"text":"Good burgers, fan of the free toppings. Got the spicy fries, was more salty than spicy. Maybe next time ill just get the regular fries! Told the guy i wanted my burger well done, he gives me this pink piece of meat!  When i 1st walked in I thought about \"In and Out burgers\" because the menu was so simple! Yes, its a bit pricy for burgers, but D-E-F-I-N-I-T-E-L-Y got the job done of sobering me up after an eventful night! The free peel it yourself peanuts were a great time killer. Not sure if this place have milkshakes! They should add it to the menu!

The place is not that clean( i ate upstairs),fries on the floor, sticky tables...But then again its a fast food joint, and  I didn't get sick! 

I noticed that they kept their newspaper \"features\" on the wall. I get it I would probably do the same! However they are old and dated! Yes you were the best burger spot in 2000 something, but that was a while ago, whatever happened to recent posts!"}
{"text":"Love this location - good food great service. always have fresh ingredients and toppings.  The fresh cut cajun fries are soo good love them. Always stop in for a bite to eat, at any FIVE GUYS especially this one!"}
{"text":"Friendly.... Fast service.... And I'm addicted to the bacon cheese dog!!!! SAVE ME!  SO GOOD  LOTS of seating plus peanuts are a fun time to eat while waiting for food :).  Bacon burgers are DOUBLE the meat.... SO GOOD ...... TRY THEM"}
{"text":"Everything is SUPER GOOD!!!! Anything with bacon .... Is crispy... Not soggy like some places.... I first tried this place in DC .... And knew we had them in Vegas... Just never been... It is my CRACK... I LOVE the burgers and more importantly the hot dogs! They are sliced and GRILLED.... So yummy! Try it!!!"}
{"text":"Consistent good experience makes this one of the best burger places I have been to. Love the fries and free peanuts are a delight to snack on while waiting for your order to be yelled out."}
{"text":"First time here, the food is awesome, quantity more than ample. Service top notch. 

Only problem, 7 young women behind the counter, music way too loud."}
{"text":"Food has no flavor , burger patties  were overcooked and not without flavor , i was expecting a juicy  hamburger  for almost 50 dollars a paid for 3 burguers and 3 fries , not worth it"}
{"text":"Staffs are friendly and burgers here are really good compare to other burger place. I love this location because of the staffs too!"}
{"text":"-2 stars because they got my order wrong. They for got my hot sauce, and i asked for freshly grilled onions and mushrooms but they used previously cooked one. (There is a difference). But my order order was complicated so +1. But I used to work at a five guys so I know how easy it could have been to get my order right. -1. +1 because they gave me a free drink. But minus one because the the fries were over done. (Watch those precooks) -1.

How ever the staff was really nice. Cashier was slightly crabby but a complicated order before shift change......i understand. Burger was an overall 'good'."}
{"text":"This is my current favorite burger place in Las Vegas. I love the fact that you can add a bunch of toppings without extra cost. The quality of the meat and fries are exceptional as well.

At this location (Flamingo & Ft Apache) they always provide wonderful service. Never had a mixed up order either. I usually order from online as it's convenient for me. The one thing is they won't cook your fries until you walk in so budget your time accordingly."}
{"text":"I think their burgers are good, not a fan at all of their fries, but my wife and daughter are!  We aren't what you call regulars here but we are not strangers by any sense of the meaning.  They are fairly quick with their orders, unless you order a shake and then we actually completed our meal before the shake was done.  I guess that is because the cashier was the one to make them and we had to wait until the line allowed her to do so....pretty strange way of divvying up the work responsibilities.  They are a fail safe if you want a quick bite and a descent burger...I am sure we will be back!  OH BTW....  do NOT approach if you have peanut allergies they are ALL over the restaurant for free appetizers"}
{"text":"Easily the best hamburgers in town. Great service, great options for hamburgers. Also grilled hot dogs are yummy. Be sure to support and try 5 Guys! My go to hamburger."}
{"text":"To me this place is 3.5 stars. I'm not dying to go back, so I rounded down to a 3. The burger was tasty for a fast food joint and reasonably priced. A big plus is choosing what you want on it. It was a little greasy, but everything seemed fresh. A step above Johnny rockets type place, but I have in n out a step above five guys. Nothing really stood out. The cajon fries were saturated in oil and were just not good at all. I really wanted to love it, but I just \"liked\" it."}
{"text":"I ordered an overpriced cheeseburger with bacon, that tasted like it was cooked while still semi-frozen and without any seasoning. If it weren't for the condiments, it would have tasted even worse."}
{"text":"I couldn't get a seat at In-N-Out so I decided to give a second chance for Five Guys.
When I got there it was empty, only one other customer.  My waitress was really overly friendly in a weird way.  I was wearing an old beat up gray tee shirt and she was complimenting me on my nice shirt?  I ordered a Cheeseburger, small fries, and a small drink.  She rang it up for 14.30 and was really slow giving me my change, counting 70 cents like five or six times.  She then took about 30 seconds to give me my five dollar bill back from the twenty I gave her, like she was going to keep it.  It was bizarre, but then I noticed she charged me for a regular order of fries.  I normally give them a buck for a tip in their bucket, but I had to say something to her about not listening to me and giving me the larger fries.  She said nothing so I told her I will just forget the tip.  It was really strange but maybe she was new.  On to the food, I got the burger loaded and it was really tasteless.  The fries were ok, but the burger was just a greasy tasteless mess.  I remember my first experience at a different location a couple of years ago, and it was similar minus the weird server.  I can't for the life of me figure out why this place is so liked.  It was empty and it is probably the overpriced food."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staff. Best fast food burgers you can find. I keep mine simple but it's always done right. Fries are amazing, a small order is enough for one person, 2-3 can split a large order. Shakes are addictive. They also have the coca cola combination soda machine."}
{"text":"Normally we get great food and great service. Today was horrible. And these people deserve $10? I don't think so. Between 4 employees they couldn't make a burger right. Not sure what's hard about a two patty bacon burger with lettuce instead of a bun. Had to wait over 10min for them to fix it. Had to wait longer because it was too difficult to make an extra patty and put bacon in it. Wow."}
{"text":"Good and tasty burgers, the bug gets soggy quickly though.  Fries are ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"Burgers, fries, and a coke. That's what they serve and they don't mess around. This location was manned by someone who was super receptive for my need to have a burger without a bun and I even heard him directing the staff to make sure they changed their gloves while handling my burger. I tried to banter about touching my buns but he didn't see the humor in my comments. I guess that's for the best."}
{"text":"No matter which 5 Guys location I go to I know I'll always get a great tasting burger and fresh fries. I like the Cajun fries because it gives it a little kick. Burger and fries. Done."}
{"text":"No frills, standard fast food eatery. And wait til you see the portions! I ordered the \"little\" cheeseburger with grilled onions, grilled jalape√±o, mustard, pickles, and lettuce. Boy oh boy am I stuffed. The toppings are unlimited FO FREE, which a college kid has gotta appreciate. Ordering options are easy with their small menu. I really recommend the Cajun fries!  

A couple of standout pieces about this place: the burgers are made fresh to order, they give you complementary peanuts. 

It's not at the top of my list by any means, but it could be a good option for end of the week greasy stress relief food. Or you know, drunk food."}
{"text":"This location of Five Guys never seems to be extremely busy which is good since you get your food within 5-10 minutes. The staff here is always courteous and friendly and are patient as they take your order. 

The food is good and always cooked fresh and gotta love the free extras they add on. My only negative is that this place always seems to be messy with dirty tables, a spill at the soda machine or trash where the lids are at. But overall good stuff to be had at Five Guys."}
{"text":"Way better than In and Out, but at $6 a double burger I'd expect as much. There's no drive through and be sure to get the smallest size fries possible ($3.99) as it's enough for 4 people and get them Cajun style."}
{"text":"From NY to NV you just can't do better than Five Guys Burger and Fries! I've never had a better burger unless I'm making it myself at home... and even then theirs is sometimes better! Fries are cut fresh in house and fried perfectly! I have nothing bad to say about this place... Awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"I had very low expectations after trying a highly reccomended burger establishment semi recently.However to my surprise Five Guys was very tastey & the portion was GINORMOUS. Filled me right up & then some with 1/2 a cheeseburger left. I'll be back Five Guys & soon."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Quick reaction to when I got to the counter. The manager was engaging and talking to me when my food was being made. The inside was clean."}
{"text":"Hand made burgers with a particular taste. 5 guys is not around do so long and quickly became one of the best burgers in town. You must try!"}
{"text":"Simple burgers with great taste. You get to choose your own toppings and enjoy peanuts while you wait. I've tried four different locations so far and everything is always perfect!"}
{"text":"$14 for a burger, fries, and a coke and let me tell you it was worth it! I ordered the Bacon Jalape√±o Cheeseburger and I've had it several times before at other locations but none like this! The burger was cooked to perfection, they didn't skimp on the fries, and oh did I say the burger was cooked perfectly? Glad I work nearby because I'll be stopping in a lot more often."}
{"text":"Note to File: My final visit to any Five Guys 8/30/2017

Where is the manager? 

This was absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at Five Guys. This place is flirty and believe me the staff had plenty of time to mop the floors, wipe the tables and condiment counter and empty the trash cans.

I think the \"heyday\" of this franchise has come and gone. 

Never Again!"}
{"text":"Soggy overpriced fast food burger with allot of hype. When you have to cover the walls with quotes how good your product is, then you have to something to hide."}
{"text":"A really good burger and you get to say exactly what you want on it. As a previous reviewer noted, it's not as good as In -N-Out Burger, but neither do you have to scrape off a huge slather of mayo from the bun or contend with Bible verses tucked into your french fry bag. Everything's a compromise.

The small burger is plenty large and ordering a bag of fries with no one to help split them is suicidal. It's kinda spendy for a burger joint, but you get a lot of food.

What prevents me from going more often is the very loud music (not just this location, it was the same in Middletown, CT.) I have to be in a mood to not be able to converse with my dining partner."}
{"text":"Burgers are overpriced and taste like a cafeteria version of hamburger. The fries are very good but, like the burger, are way over priced. $38 for three little burgers, two regular drinks and two fries. This is a no-go."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about five guys and wanted to give it a try. We were walking around state street and just wanted a quick bite to eat. Honestly I'm not sure if i would go back, the burger i ordered was okay but not worth the price i paid. I also purchased a water bottle and it was close to $3 and it was a smaller size too. The fries were okay. The place was also kinda dirty, i really wished the tables were clean."}
{"text":"Had the tastiest burger today! My fave is the Lil Bacon Cheeseburger w/little fries. Which is actually a big meal in reality. My food tasted very fresh."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I've tried this chain a few times and every time it's just so greasy!!!! Not my idea of a good burger but it looks like I'm in the minority."}
{"text":"I enjoy 5 Guys for one reason.  Consistent.  It is a simple concept.  They do not over promise or offer an amazingly complicated and confusing menu.
Straight forward delivery.  What you see, literally, is what you get.  Good food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Definitely love Five Guys. However, I was dissapointed that this location apparently doesn't know that they have a secret menu and they wouldn't make me a patty melt..."}
{"text":"I had to think long and hard about what kind of rating to give this Five Guys. When it comes right down to it, I quite enjoyed my burger, and I can't say I've had really bad experiences here either. But I think with everything rolled together, I find as much mediocrity with the place as I do good stuff, hence the mediocre rating. 
I've been eating at Five Guys for well over a decade, starting when it was exclusively an American offering; and I was really excited when I heard they were coming to Canada. I've tried many locations here, and I'm not sure if the novelty has worn off, or they're  just not as good as they used to be: either way, I've also struggled with finding consistency in the quality. Most recently my burger was quite good, but at this same place I've also gotten overcooked and dry, or sloppy and soggy burgers. When I'm shelling out over $10 for a burger (the cheeseburger is now $8.99 plus tax), it better be perfect every time. 
I'm also a little tired of not ever getting any sort of deal at this chain. Never a special. Never a lunch combo offering, etc. Just premium prices for a product that's not as premium as they are. 
And yes, the regular cheeseburger is a double patty. But that's two 3.3 ounce patties, not two 4 ounce ones. And it's noticeable. 
I don't want to be too negative though. When done properly, the burgers are tasty, the fries are plentiful, and the service is good. And I'm sure I'll be back again"}
{"text":"Do not have gravy -  awesome fries but no gravy!

Ordered a hot dog for the daughter, and 2 cheeseburgers for wife and I.

took about 7 minutes from order to in our hands.
Burgers were tasty and cooked well  -- but messy as all heck - -(my entire bun contents exited through the back door and plopped on the table.

Daughters Hotdog was tasty (in her words- Best Hotdog ever) -- she only had ketchup on it though -- and ketchup ruins everything ----

Fries were good --fresh cut and not overly salted -- but their trademark \"dump the fries into the bag\" kind of made a mess ------- 

overall enjoyed the meal and would go back if in that side of town again, but ot making a special trip."}
{"text":"A most pleasant experience while eating a most delicious cheese burger and fries with my wife and family.  Our son and daughter-in-law treated us to this very scrumptious meal after a visit to the local zoo.  You may see our review posted of that location at your pleasure and convenience. We left Five Guys over stuffed, as the portions are quite generous, and being able to gain a refill of our beverage of choice was a bonus. Good job you servers and prepares, well done."}
{"text":"Tried this place out while on vacation after being recommended by a coworker. 

I was quite fascinated by the simplicity of the restaurant when I first came in. A couple dozen bags of raw potatoes near the front door and the simple decor made the experience quite interesting. 

The menu was short and sweet. I opted to share a regular Bacon Cheeseburger with BBQ sauce and a few other toppings with my girlfriend. We also ordered the Cajun fries (why not right?) and drink. Did I mention they have one of those fancy Coca-Cola machines where you can get the different flavored versions of your favorite soft drink!? It was awesome! The whole meal came out to a little over $10, but was definitely enough for 2 people to share (or maybe 1 SUPER hungry person).

All the staff members seemed to be having fun on the job and not in a bad way. They were communicating loudly and effectively, while at the same time making it fun.

Overall I had an awesome experience with some very tasty food. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Not the cheapest, just the best. Seriously. I get \"the works\", they load my scrumptious plump burger with Erryting - A1 sauce, sauteed onions, swiss cheese, erryting. I get a bacon burger. Their fries are east coast boardwalk awesome. Sprinkle some vinegar & salt. Heaven! Wanna great burger? Oh, and did I mention free peanuts? And the wicked coolest soda machine in the world with like a gazillion combinations of every type of soda? Yea, they have that, too."}
{"text":"The food is great big juicy burgers, may need to share. The staff is fun and very helpful. A bit on the pricey side"}
{"text":"Food and service was great, restaraunt needed a sweep and was really cold. But everywhere has the temerature low in AZ"}
{"text":"Went the first time the other day.

AMAZING!

Free peanuts while you wait, massive, juicy burgers and a bag full of fries.
One of the best burger places I have been to!"}
{"text":"I like the food but they have the music so loud it's uncomfortable.  I don't eat here often because of the music."}
{"text":"This place is great for when you want something fast but don't do fast food!  It had a 50's diner feel to it, really nice employees and fast service.  The fries are freaks cut and fried in peanut oil which I really like, and the burgers come in two sizes so you can get a smaller one if you don't want a monster burger... But they have those too!  They also have just about ever topping for a burger you could think of...  No drive thru, but it's worth it to run in and grab to go or stay and eat a minute.  The music is loud and sometimes a little annoying depending on what is playing;)...   Just say no to crap like mcdonalds and come here instead!"}
{"text":"Great location just off the highway. Came here on a Sunday afternoon to grab a quick bite to eat. There was no one in line and fast service. I waited about 8 minutes for my order which was a small cheeseburger with bacon, small fry and regular drink. The cashier asked if I wanted a pouting and milkshake on top of that. Tempting, but maybe next time my belly calls for meat. There were peanuts at the counter for a snack while you wait, surprised to see such a clean floor. The other locations had peanut shells on the floors. This location overall is well kept and clean. Maybe I am just getting old, but my only complaint about these resto chains is the loud music. They can lower the volume so we can talk amongst ourselves."}
{"text":"So am I the only person that watches Man vs. Food?  Well if you watch that show then you'll know what I mean when I say...OH MY GOODNESS...OH MY GOODNESS!!! OH MY FRICKEN GOODNESS!

This is the best burger I've eaten in the state of Arizona over the past 12 years!

I tried to understand what I was feeling when I took my first bite so I could describe it to you...you know how Man vs. Food does it?  

All I can say is, it was JUICY, FLAVORFUL, EXTREMELY DELICIOUS and HUGE!  I just got the 2 patty!  Oh I can't forget the fries!! THE BEST FRIES EVER! If you don't believe me then go check it out for yourself!

This place can become very addicting.  It taste like a homemade grilled burger but 50 times better!!!  

All I gotta say is In and Out, Fat Burger need to pack up their stores and get the hell outta town!  I done found my new burger joint!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch I was going to barbecue but found it to be too hot and I was too tired. 

The Cajun fries and the cheese bacon hamburger were excellent. Forgot my grilled jalape√±os but I'll live with that."}
{"text":"Burgers were quite sloppy...Flavours not worth the money"}
{"text":"Out of all the 5 guys burgers. This location is the best!! 

They always make your fries fresh.

Wait time is usually not long since they are pretty dead."}
{"text":"I've never had a more genuinely enthusiastic greeting at a fast food joint than I did at this Five Guys.  The guy just laid on the sugar and it didn't even seem saccharine.

My goodness!  I ordered a Little Cheeseburger \"All the Way\" with regular (not cajun) fries.  When I got my order, there was nothing little about anything I got. Basically a sack full of fries, under which was buried a generous quarter pound cheeseburger with lettuce, mayo, tomato, grilled onions and mushrooms, pickles, mustard... I think that was all?  

Well the burger was delicious, very juicy and tasty, and the fries were savory too.  But they need to work on those buns - no I'm not referring to the physique of the employees but to the buns on the burgers.  The thing was falling apart when I took my first bite and by the end of the burger I was digging my thumbs into a gooey patty.  If your burger is this hard core, you want a formidable bun to match it."}
{"text":"Always a tasty treat to get a burger here. Always made fresh to order. 
On my last visit, I notice they no longer have the peanuts upon entering. They still have them, but you get them after you order. I usually get a side order of fries as well. I find a small order is good for myself and two boys.
Service is always good, and the restaurant itself is clean."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm eating a burger straight from my dads grill when I come here, but even better! The burgers are delicious!! The fries with vinegar is awesome and the pop machine is pretty cool as well. The peanuts all over the floor is kinda gross but whatever. I love it! Sadly I work right next door and I constantly want to go grab a burger, self control is necessary when you take the first bite!"}
{"text":"If you want something other than the standard arches around Yonge/Dundas in a takeout place, this is it.  I don't usually go to these larger chains, but I just had to have a burger.

There is a lot to be said for having a clean and spacious place when you're downtown, and this place delivers.  They cook the food in front of you so you can see everything's done properly.  The red and bright white d√©cor makes you feel confident in the place's cleanliness, even the washroom smells fresh!

The burger patty is made with high quality beef, and the 'Lil' burger I got is what I would call a regular size at most quality places, so you're definitely getting value for portions.  The toppings are generously heaped, and includes all the usuals, with higher quality lettuce and tomatoes.  You get your basics and your sauteed onions, but more selection with relishes and mustards would definitely kick it up a notch.  Maybe the clientele likes it simple, but it's up to individual taste I suppose."}
{"text":"I went to five guys for the first time yesterday, May 1st 2018. I have heard about and drove by it dozens of times but never went in. I was so impressed, the burger was great!  I thought Shake Shake has the best quick serve/counter service burgers until I came here. I like how you order what you want on it and they don't nickel and dime you for adding the things you want on it. The service was very friendly and the food great!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great customer service, what more could ya ask for??? Hopping with fun people.!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Had been to one before and this one is more of the same amazing food.  I came just days after it opened across the street from Kent State University and it was absolutely packed.  Even so our order didn't take very long. They have a very limited menu but it's really all you need.  I had a bacon cheeseburger and Cajun fries and it was ana amazing lunch.  Only complaint is their small parking lot, might have to park at Burger King next door if it's busy."}
{"text":"Probably the best burgers I've had in my life so far. I had the double cheeseburger recommended by Daym Drops on Youtube.

DAYUM DAYUM DAYUM!!!!

Let's start with the food:
The beef patties are extremely juicy, flavorful, and cooked to the right doneness; it was so juicy that I had to slurp the juice oozing out of the burger.
I had the all-dressed garnishes plus a couple drops of hot sauce. The saut√©ed mushrooms, onions, the cheese... everything just works out so well together.
They also have wonderfully cooked French fries with great cajun spices. The textures of the fries are something I've never experienced before, and I think it has to do with the quality of their potatoes.

The service:
Talking about real fast food, not your average-McDonald's-stuff. They literally have an assembly line inside that restaurant so the service is extremely efficient and fast. On top of that, they wrap your burger in aluminum foil to keep the heat well preserved, so that even if you order takeout in a Canadian winter, you can still enjoy warm tasty burgers when you get home.

The environment:
I like the ambience of the place. It gives one a real feel of what an American burger joint should feel like. The newspaper and magazine mentions framed on the walls showed how proud they are being \"The best Burger in Canada.\" Nonetheless, the restaurant is pretty messy, especially the soda fountain. In addition, the tables are not very clean and the spacing of the tables are pretty bad.

The price:
Pretty pricey for some burgers IMHO. For the price of a double cheeseburger you can get a Double Big Mac trio in McDonald's. That being said, I'd take Five Guys over McDonald's any day."}
{"text":"My little burger was tasty, but they forgot to put the onions on it. Ordered the little Cajun fries. There's usually enough for 2 people but this time there was barely enough for one! The little cup had about a dozen fries. What a bummer. A place known for their generous portion of fries has cut majorly back."}
{"text":"One of the best burger chains around, this is your standard fare 5 guys.
Huge burgers with lots of melty American cheese and loads of toppings.

Fries are HUGE and they comically toss twice as much fries as the fry cups can hold, so your bag is loaded to the bottom with crispy goodness.

I once had a issue with the foil wrapper which makes the bun a touch soggy, but it also makes the cheese super melty, which definitely adds the true American Burger experience.

Also they DO NOT season their patties, which is an interesting touch. You get your sodium from the fries and toppings, which is unique. Ground beef is surprisingly good on its own."}
{"text":"To call Five Guys the east coast version of In-N-Out does a great disservice to them and their burgers.  Yes they both hand cut their fries in the store, but where In-N-Out uses vegetable oil Five Guys uses peanut oil and offers Yummy Cajun Fries.

Their burgers are also freshly made in the store.  The best part though is that there is no stupid secret menu that you need to memorize in order to get the burger exactly how you want it.  Five Guys has it all spelled out for you and a wide selection of toppings and condiments to choose from."}
{"text":"I've never been to 5 guys before so when I was craving a hot dog before the gym and 5 guys came up on yelp I saw the perfect opportunity to try it! I'm glad I did! Sherry was my cashier and she was so nice and welcoming... I probably changed my mind 3 times and she didn't get frustrated or rude or anything! Nice big smile.. I say this in every yelp review its hard to get good service and her service was 5 star! My hot dog was delicious it was kosher with grilled onions, crushed up bacon, and mustard. Yum I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Actually pretty sub-par for a 5 Guys.'

Small parking lot, but its across from my dorm so whatever.

They adjusted their hours for the college crowd, which is nice, but its just not up to par with the quality of 5 Guys elsewhere.

And judging by the lack of activity I see there a few months after opening (I was super stoked coming back from spring break to see it under construction too, all) people realized that for whatever reason, the burgers just ain't as juicy at this one."}
{"text":"Very poor service takes forever to get your order. 
The food is horrible the fries are under cooked. The hamburger was greasey and bun soggy. 
The price is high for what you get
Doubt I'd come back here
No manager to supervise a disorganized crew"}
{"text":"You know! For a $4.00 burger it was REALLY GOOD! I had the single patty cheeseburger it was leaps & bounds better than In N Out Burger.......down the street~ 
   Beware 1 order of fries should be plenty for 2 people. These FRIES  are also quite FAB too!! Maybe slightly to salty but still DEELISSSSH.
    The free in shell peanuts are a nice way to pass the time waiting for your order also~"}
{"text":"Five Guys is so good. Have to admit that the first time I tried them I was not to impressed but on subsequent visits I have grown to really like them. It seems there is a big Five Guys Vs In N Out thing going on but I don't thing you can compare them. they each have there own unique taste. Plus I don't want to choose on over the other. They are both great.
Now Five Guys is just a little more expensive but just a little and it is so worth it. Also just a tip unless you really love french fries just order the small because they pile more than enough into the bag. Which is great but why pay for a large when you get enough with a small unless of course you want a ton of fries.
I know they have hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches but I haven't been able to get by the burgers yet. They are so good. I get it \"all the way\" except leave off the grilled mushrooms unless I am in the mood for them. Also a warning their regular burgers are doubles so unless you like double burgers make sure you let them know you want a single.
But the menu is fairly simple and you can get anything made the way you want it. Also if you want to hang out and eat there they have free peanuts.
The staff is always really nice. You can see them make your food and the place is always clean. Just wish it was a little cheeper so I could eat there more often.
They also get an extra point because they have a Coke Freestyle machine."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys in general, but this one misses the mark for me. My wife and I have gone many times to this location, and it's never really clean. The upkeep on the condiment bar is subpar as well - every time we've gone either the ketchup dispensers are empty, they are out of lids for our cups, or there are no more straws, etc. 

I also notice a difference in the way my food is prepared. While my wife loads up on toppings, I keep it plain with just mustard. It's normally very good at other Five Guys but whenever I go to this location there is almost never enough on there for me to taste it. Even worse, they put on so little that it absorbs into the bread immediately, making the burger taste very dry. It happens every time and while we will still go if my wife has the caving (if I can't persuade her to get a burger elsewhere), from now on I'll be sticking to the fries. They, at least, are consistent in their quality."}
{"text":"I love everything I've ever gotten here. The Cajun fries are to die for, cheeseburgers are delicious, and the coke freestyle machine is always stocked unlike at a lot of food establishments. The portions are fairly large so I suggest sharing fries with a friend"}
{"text":"Of all fast food burger places, this is my absolute favorite. All I ever wanted was a burger that tastes like fresh from a restaurant, but is cooked faster, and this is the ONLY burger place that gives you that. There patties are appropriately sized so you can actually taste some meat, as opposed to In N Out Burger, McDs, BK, Carl Jr's, etc. You can order whatever you want on the burger for no extra charge. And especially, I love the option of the cajun fries. Only downside is that the burgers seem to fall apart; I don't know if it's a grease, topping, and/or bun problem, but mine always do. Doesn't stop me from going back though. Great burger place."}
{"text":"After hearing so much hype about Five Guys Burgers I decided to try it out.  My conclusion?  OK, but nothing to write home about.  

It's cool that you don't have to pay extra for toppings like cheese, mushrooms, etc., but of course all that is built in to the price (around $6-8 per burger).  Personally I prefer grilled burgers over fried, but it's good quality meat compared to the typical fast food joint (which should be expected given the difference in price). 

I didn't care for the fries, although they weren't bad.  A bit soggy for my tastes.  Five Guys is obviously proud of the fact that they use peanut oil--there are posters and burlap bags of peanuts in the store alerting you to that.  While peanut oil is an improvement over canola and corn oil based on its lipid profile, lard would be even healthier and probably taste better. (Of course many people buy into the propaganda that ingesting saturated animal fat clogs one's arteries and leads to obesity and heart disease.  Not true.)  

What's interesting to me in reading some of the other reviews is that In-N-Out is held by many to be the standard for good burgers.  Personally I can't stand In-N-Out...I think they're about the worst tasting burgers around.  I would rate Whataburger much higher.  Of course taste is highly subjective, and as the adage goes 'To each their own.'  For what it's worth, I consider Five Guys better than In-N-Out, but that's not saying much in my opinion.  

To summarize my view of Five Guys: overrated and overpriced, but not extremely so."}
{"text":"I don't review burger places.. unless if one of those times when I do. I have tried five guys one time, long ago.. and now I did it again. It wasn't my idea, but I did go along with it. 'Nuff excuses.

So I ordered a burger. No cheese, no bacon but with grilled onions. Apparently did my selective memory forget that a burger is a double burger. This makes it trickier to eat. Oh, yes it does. 

Five Guys is an attempt to make fast food burger joint to be a little bit more than a fast food burger joint, without having anything special to back that claim up. Now the burgers here are fine. I do like them, but the cost-increase is not justified. I have heard some people truly rave about this place, but it is the same'ol, same'ol burger place that has developed since the 50'ies. The burgers are good, as they are in many other places. But it's only a burger.. not a magical burger, not a meal-o'meat extraordinaire - just a tasty burger. Nothing more. 

Other good-tasting-burger-places you can have a good craft beer and a waitress fetching you all your wishes, but at five guys it is only the burger.. the rest is standard chain BS. I do believe they have better meat and condiments than the chain-burger-place, but then again.. I feel I have beaten this horse enough. 

Good burger. Only. Nothing more. No beer. Sad face. 

Need a tip? - Have a better burger at a place that serve beer."}
{"text":"After hearing all kinds of good things about Five Guys, I finally got to try them while shopping at Dix30. The location is convenient enough, right near to Adonis, and although the parking lot is super busy there was a little pocket of spots available right next to Five Guys. I'm told this is usually the case.

The burgers, while a wee bit pricier than your standard fast food burger, are much more delicious! A small means one patty, a large is two. We were two to dine, and a small burger each and a regular fry split between us was perfect. The burgers are meaty and satisfying. The toppings are free and customizable, though I kept it simple and ordered mine all dressed. Next time though (because there will be a next time!) I'll get creative."}
{"text":"To be blunt, it's pretty expensive - $16 for a burger and fries that doesn't taste any different than the same meal one third the price. However, the service at this store is well above average. It's a bunch of young kids...but they have been trained well. They are attentive, respectful, and eager to help you however they can. I was very impressed with this dine in experience."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a better rating I would... The staff is very nice, the atmosphere is great, the tunes are loud but your still able to talk. The manager was extremely friendly. Not one thing bad to say about this place... Great experience.."}
{"text":"First time to Five Guys, friendly and fast service. I did not realize the food was so large. Burger and fries were great. About ten minutes from the Arizona Open Wheel Racing Museum."}
{"text":"One of my favourite burger joints. Main reasons: their juicy, flavourful and large portions. Who doesn't love free peanuts while waiting for your burger.

Anyways, back to the burger. I always order the bacon cheeseburger when I want to splurge. Maybe not the healthiest meals, but when you want to pig out and craving a juicy burger, this is the place. It's around $10 for a burger. Worth it.

The downside about five guys... Wait times. We have expectations in North America that fast food should be fast. When I have 4 people in front of me in the line, the expectations at least a 10 minute wait. But I'm in no rush to wait for something I want.

Enjoy Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Kind of small and a little pricey but excellent food! Sends me into a food coma everytime!"}
{"text":"Je suis tellement pas dans une phase ' fast food' ces temps-ci ! 
Mais le Five Guys est l'alternative par excellence aux restaurants de burgers qu'on conna√Æt. En effet, son menu comprend des hot-dogs et des burger, ainsi que la traditionnelle poutine. Pour accompagnement, il y a les rondelles d'oignon, et les frites : originales ou cajun. *prenez cajun !!! * La provenance des pommes de terres est inscrite chaque jour devant la caisse. 

Les burgers sont assez copieux, alors un petit cheez pour moi suffit. Chaque boulette est cuite individuellement a partir d'une boulette faite devant vous, donc pas de mauvaise surprise sur la provenance  Vous avez le loisir d'y ajouter une panoplie d'ingr√©dients frais tels que des champignons grill√©s, oignons marin√©s ou crus, cornichons, tomate, salade et plein d'autres ! N'oubliez pas vos condiments en sauce pr√©f√©r√©s :)

Le plus beau la-dedans c'est que tu peux ramener ton verre chez toi , comme quand tu √©tais petit et que tu chignais au cin√©ma pour avoir le verre en plastique r√©utilisable. ( ou a disney on ice, on a pas tous eu la m√™me enfance ! ) 
Oh well, je m'√©gare.
Five guys, c'est vraiment bon."}
{"text":"Very loud noisy place due to the hard floor and walls. Workers dragging charts and tables around while I was trying to eat. Sweeping around my table while I was eating, a big no-no! Very discourteous to patrons. Manager was completely apathetic when I brought these things to his attention, didn't even apologize. I won't be back."}
{"text":"So after reading some not so hot reviews, it took me a bit longer to check this place out than I normally would. I decided after a great workout at Golds, what better way to reward myself than a cheeseburger and fries! So I sauntered into 5 guys, and got down to business. I ordered the \"small\" burger, which just means that you only have one patty instead of two. They have an enormous list of toppings, I ordered it with everything. That included mayo, ketchup, mustard, pickles, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions and grilled mushrooms. They had a bunch of other toppings too, but what I had was more than enough. I decided to go with the regular fries as opposed to the cajun fries, that they're supposedly known for. I do have to say I'm always impressed when burger joints have the hand-cut fries. They were good here, not the best I've ever had, but good. (That honor goes to my fave spot back in Washington, Burger Express). The burger was good, it seemed better than most people's experiences I think. it could be that they weren't crazy busy, as it was just after they opened on a Sunday. It was just what I wanted in a burger. Juicy, messy and a decent price. I still think Lenny's burgers are way better, but the fries here get the nod. Overall a cool little spot in downtown to get a decent burger and fries."}

Anyone can make a great burger, but for me, Jerry made this enough for me to keep returning and bring my friends too. that's what makes it 5 for me

Btw im no way affiliated with this place but feel that if you want to be treated well and know your food is good try this location"}
{"text":"Delicious! When I'm craving a good ol American burger this is my favorite place....made to order,  fresh toppings of your choice,  Cajun fries are seasoned well and full of flavor (servings are plentiful-perfect for sharing) 
Oh and free shelled peanuts to munch on!
Always great service =)"}
{"text":"I am not a burger person normally, but WOW! They do a perfect, delicious, simple burger here. They come in two sizes. I am assuming the smaller one is one patty, the regular is two patties.All the topping choices (there are many!) are free to add on as you like. The cheese burger is slightly more. My daughter likes it too! We tried the fries and they were fine but just a great burger is enough for us. I think I will be going back again fairly soon.. :-) Also, they have salted peanuts to snack on while you wait - a nice unique touch. Good on you Five Guys! :-)"}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of good things about Five Guys so I decided to try it out.  I ordered two burgers, two fries, two drinks, and a hot dog and was shocked by the price.  Over $30.00 is ridiculous in my opinion.  I figured it must be really great but that assumption was wrong.  It tasted like any other burger and hotdog out there.  The best part were the Cajun fries.  The order took about 30 minutes, which was also ridiculous.  If I am going to wait that long when there are only 3 other tables occupied, it had better be amazing.  Very disappointed in the price and taste.  Other fast food places are far better."}
{"text":"I really, really enjoy the double burger with bacon and raw jalapenos! This place is very close to my house so its convenient as well.

I only gave 3 stars due to the high prices (when I go I only order a double cheese burger and it costs around 7 bucks). I only go when I am in the mood cause In-N-Out is right next door and I can get a meal for the same price as just a Burger at Five Guys. 

Great food, bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I am from the east coast, but I don't see the love for In-N-Out burgers.  Since everyone is comparing them here is my 2 cents. Five Guys Burgers are hand formed and taste way more like beef than the thin tiny burgers at In-N-Out.  You can also get pretty much any topping you can think of at Five Guys.  The real stand out is the fries.  I recommend getting them with Cajun as that makes them truly amazing.  No matter what size fires you get they give you a ton of them.  More than enough to share. For what you get I don't see how Five Guys is really that more expensive than any of the other burger places around here.  A \"regular\" burger here is a double patty burger and very large.  I usually get a small burger and that's just fine."}
{"text":"i always love fiv guys no matter what state i am in.  This location wasnt bad as the cooks were quick and clean.  i just wish the tables were cleaned more."}
{"text":"LOVE: Free peanuts, free refills, free toppings (including grilled onions and mushrooms), fresh food made to order, and the sign that tells you where the potatoes came from each day

LIKE: Casual & laid back diner ambience, friendly service, soft sesame burger bun

I do like the burger overall, not that there's anything so stellar about them to write home over. The meat is good and fresh, but could be more flavourful. However there are lots of toppings to choose from that will help counter that problem.

There's defnitely a lot of value coming here. For $3.99 you get a pretty huge serving of fries too which my finace loves, but I'm more of a fan of Burger Priest's fries!"}
{"text":"It's great to have a decent burger joint around Markham. Five Guys have their characteristic diner decor with the usual food court table and chairs which are kept pretty clean for how messy the burger can get - because they stuff a lot of toppings in the burger and you're bound to make a mess while eating! 

I've long found they give you much bigger portions than you'd expect. I always order the small fries because as it turns out they just fill the paper bag with fries anyway regardless of what size it is.  The difference between a junior and a regular burger is 1 vs 2 patties, and I'm more than full with a junior burger. 

Fountain drinks are self served and refillable, which is always great. And of course free peanuts!"}
{"text":"I LOVE 5 GUYS! Besides loving their app (Android and IOS) you can also call in an order. 

Staff is friendly, food is incredible, and you always get a ton of those awesome fries.  Ton's of toppings to choose from for your burger, and hot dogs as well. 

NOTE FOR THOSE WITH PEANUT ALLERGY - The cook the fries in peanut oil, and there are peanuts for snacking while you wait. 

Your not going to find a better burger in the area!!!"}
{"text":"I made my first trip into Five Guys last week. It is a nice time to try new places in Madison, because the students have largely left and this reduces the crowd. I was a bit shocked at the prices (a cheeseburger, fries and pop totaled over $12); however, I stuck it out as I was really in the mood for a burger.

I'll start with the good part. The service is quick and the staff was friendly. The fries, while seemingly expensive, were very good and provided enough (at the \"little fries\" level) to serve at least two, not three, people. The restaurant was clean and enjoyable. 

One thing about the fries: if you are truly unable to digest flour, they coat their fries with it. I don't know if they offer a gluten free fry, but you should ask. 

Now to the burger. Oh my. I ordered \"all the way\" which is the cheeseburger with everything (onions, tomato, pickles, mushrooms, ketchup, mustard ,etc). I didn't really want mushrooms but it was easier to say \"the works\". The propaganda for the restaurant (and many of the reviews on this site) promote the idea of a burger made from quality products and cooked to order. The burger was cooked to order

The burger was okay. juicy and thick, but part of a parceled package, not made from local meat or hand pressed. The mushrooms were, sadly, canned and tasteless. The tomato slice (singular) was nice and seemed fresh but it was swallowed up by the other toppings. The cheese, in Wisconsin no less, was basically Velveeta. The worst aspect was the bun: a cheap white bread sesame seed covered bun. It managed to hold together to the 6 minutes of processing time in eating, but was completely unenjoyable and generally complimented the cheapness of the mushrooms and cheese. 

For the price asked, a much better burger could be had at the Red Shed (just a block away) or Dotty's Dumplings, The Nitty Gritty (also within a few blocks. I get that the State Street location pushes up the rent and the cost, but I can't believe the other reviewers are eating at the same place."}
{"text":"This place kills me.  Wait, check that, this place kills my waistline.  How can I say no to a LITTLE bacon cheeseburger?  That thing is anything BUT little.  It's still huge.  And little french fries?  Yeah, those easily serve 3-4 people as a side item.  I swear I don't eat fast food but yet I eat at Five Guys.  I secretly wish they would add grilled chicken to their menu like the Smashburger chain has.  That way my guilt level can come down a little bit for frequenting this place as much as I do."}
{"text":"The burgers and hot dogs are good, but very over priced.  There are better options nearby. 

My main problem with this place is that the service is flat terrible.  Slow, inattentive and generally rude.  Avoid.

I tried the place three times. Three strikes and I'm out."}
{"text":"Came by for an early dinner while in the area and found them to be quite empty. After we ordered a small line formed and seats slowly filled up.

I find this place expensive for what it is. We got a little cheeseburger, a little bacon cheeseburger and a regular fries - the bill came up to ~$20-25. I like their burger because it does have the \"beefy\" taste and they always throw in more fries  and all toppings are free being a plus. However, the price and wait times definitely not a plus for me.

I come here once in a while and until a better/cheaper option opens up around here, I'll still be coming here for those burger fixes."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH!!!!! I just tried Five Guys for the first time this week and I must say that I am absolutely in LOVE with this place. They have the best burgers I have ever eaten in my life! My family and I got it to-go so the fries were kind of wimpy when we got it home but I don't even care because the burger totally made up for it! I wish there was a little more seating for people with to-go orders too but I did not mind standing. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Although busy, service was quick and orderly, and the people worker were efficient. 

I got a little bacon cheeseburger. The toppings were fresh and crisp, which I didn't realize played such a big role, but it played out really nicely. Compared to most places, I got a nice amount of bacon on top of the fresh patty that they grill after you order. 

My friend got fries, which were either soggy or too crisp all throughout the tiny cup he got, and these seemed overpriced, although the quality was evident. Maybe we just got a bad batch? 

The place itself is a nice dining experience, I like it in there. Yeah.

Overall, a great place, just off a few points for the fries and their price of said fries, but otherwise good stuff :P"}
{"text":"Five Guys is an average burger and fry joint that is WAY over priced. 
Burgers are greasy, fries are soggy hot dogs are over the top expensive. Over two dollars for a soda? I suppose the lease on the fancy machine is expensive.

If you want an average burger, soggy fries, and expensive soda go to Five guys.


In N Out is a much better burger place."}

{"text":"I've been here numerous times. And, I like it! But, today, exceeded my expectations. The burgers and fries were excellent, as usual. What really wowed me was the staff. They were high energy and very accommodating. The manager Luis came around and asked everyone if they were ok. I love his proactive approach. He even refilled my water for me. I like 5 Guys even more after today. Thank you."}

{"text":"I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about, but for a \"fast food\" burger I think Five Guys rocks!  I went here with my Husband, who has been raving out Five Guys ever since he had it a month ago.  He has been begging me to go, but I don't eat fast food very often, so it wasn't on my priory list.  Well, we went here before a Suns game last week and I must say, it blew me away.

The burger is, by far, the best fast food burger I've had.  It was made to order and I had all the toppings I love.  I got the \"little\" cheese burger with hot sauce (oh so good) and grilled onions and mushrooms.  We shared regular fries and they too were sooo... good!  

So, for what it is, Five Guys is great!  I know my Husband and I will be back when we get a craving for a good, cheap, fatty meal."}

{"text":"Hit or miss. Sometimes your food turns out good sometimes your food doesn't. I order the same thing every time so it should be more consistent. Last time I ordered over the phone, I wasn't told how much my total was. Once I got there to pick up my food, I asked if they took Apple Pay then they said that they were only taking cash because their machine was down. Someone would think it would be common sense to position that when taking my order over the phone. A \"by the way, our machine is down so bring cash\" would have been fine but nothing but a blank stare after saying we can't take cash right now and after I told them that it would have been helpful if I knew that prior to driving over here, then I get a \"I didn't take that phone call\" and then long quiet stare. I guess if you don't have great customer service maybe at least have good consistent food but you can't be bad at both of those things. 

2 stars for at least sometimes being good. Probably will be at the bottom of my list if I'm craving a burger now."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Five Guys prior to a couple days ago, in at least 3-4 years. Last time I went, I was in Northridge, CA, and they were having issues with their ventilation, so we ate as fast as we could, just so we could leave, so needless to say, it had just left a bad taste in our mouths. 

On my way there, I decided to see if I can place an online order, and it couldn't have been easier. It wasn't even through an app, it was just load up their website and start ordering! Being on a Keto diet, I was curious how it would work out, and if they had options with no bun, and low and behold; \"In a bowl\" and \"Lettuce wrapped\" were one of the first few options!

Once I got there, I just had to go up to the register, tell them my name, grab my drink cup and I'm done, just waiting for the food at that point.

I ended up ordering the \"In a bowl\" option for my wife and I and I even added a patty to their bacon cheeseburger, not realizing, that their standard bacon cheeseburger is already a double. It's ok, we had leftovers. We added grilled jalape√±os, grilled onions, tomatoes, lettuce, mayo and mustard, and the burger already had cheese and bacon. The combo was perfect, I'd order it the SAME way next time, except, without the extra patty.

{"text":"In my honest opinion Five Guys Burger are the best! All thumb down to other burger joints. The burgers are fresh and delicious!!! If you never tried one! your missing out."}
{"text":"Finally... After a year of hearing about Five Guys, I get to try their burger at the new Markham location. Stopped by on a Saturday evening, it wasn't by any means busy, no line up... Yey!

I got:
- Bacon cheeseburger with everything
Yes... The burger is simple but quite good! Soft bun, juicy beef and evenly spread out toppings.
- fries, also got to try my bro's cajun fries
The fries were ok, the cajun ones were overly seasoned... You'll need a lot of ketchup to mask the saltiness.
The staff is quick and the food is piping hot.

While the burgers are good, I don't always wanna pay $15 everytime I crave the basic burger and fries. Will definitely return if I'm in the area... 3.5 stars

PS
Does anyone know what up with the peanuts? Do people really eat them? Doesn't seem to go with the burgers or fries."}
{"text":"My favorite burger joint. I can't get enough. If only they would deal with the bathroom. 


Food: 5/5 Two big thumbs up from me. 
Service: 4/5 Speedy.
Environment: 5/5 I like the diner look.
Washrooms: 1/5 Really needs some loving.
Worth it?: 5/5 If you aren't allergic to peanuts. 

Five guys knows how to keep a burger sweet and simple. There are no gimmicks, no grilled cheese buns or stuffed patties. Just good old fashion burgers. The toppings selection is great and this peanut oil thing they got going on is perfect (unless you're allergic).

To pair it off I always have to go with the cajun fries. Great seasoning and the complimentary peanuts really seal the deal. 

If only they would clean the washrooms they are a mess and smell really bad. I might need to stick to takeout!"}
{"text":"Everyone's burger was badly overcooked.  Got one order completely wrong.  Fries weren't even good.  Not sure what has happened to this place.  Bummed we bought a $30 bag of junk."}
{"text":"I was first turned on to this place by my favorite blog: Ernie's House of Whoopass (www.ehowa.com).  The burgers are made fresh and the toppings are copious and flavorful.  The fries come out either plain or Cajun (we love the Cajun) and the drinks are unending.  Good value for the price."}
{"text":"I was not expecting this place to cost so much.. My meal alone was $13.60!!! It's ridiculous that there's no combo or anything to knock off a few bucks. Although, I had the burger, and all I could think was \"I can't believe this cost me $13.60 but damn this is a good burger...\" It was delicious, but not for the price of an entree at the Cheesecake Factory. This place is ridiculously over-priced. Good luck staying in business."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service
Rude employees 
Overcharged my 10 year old and did not return the money. 
Then she completely burned the hot dog."}
{"text":"Walk into this place and you know right away its not your average fast food joint.  The peanut bags and shells are everywhere so if you are allergic to peanuts you definitely wouldn't be a fan here.  The serving sizes are not for those wanting to keep calories low.  We ordered the regular size burgers and they were enormous I couldn't even imagine getting their large ones.  The fries are my favorite, the peanut oil makes a huge difference with the taste although they are heavily salted so for me that is just heaven.  They have the new coke machines in here that have multitudes of sugared options ready to trigger the onset diabetes.  Yes folks clearly not a place to stay healthy but a good cheat for week."}
{"text":"Five Guys is the best burger place in entire Toronto as for me. No complicated items or toppings you dislike in a burger. Choose everything by yourself. That's what I like the most! The number of toppings to add is not scanty like other places offer. Here you have all the possible options to imagine. 
What I really appreciate in this chain that the customer has a good observation on the process of preparing the food. In this way I am always sure that the cook was wearing disposable gloves, kitchen surface is not choked up with extra objects and the grill is clean. This place is really concerned about maintaining standards and norms, that's why it deserved my respect and loyalty as a customer."}
{"text":"The meat patty was half the size of the bun and the fries were nothing but potato skins. Very disappointed in this Five Guys location."}
{"text":"Frys are always awesome.  Burgers were good.  Drinks were good. But WTF is up with the overly loud music in the place. The music is constantly so loud that I can barely talk to someone across the table.   Dropping 1 star for the noise level.  If they turned down the music, they wouldn't have to yell to communicate in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I like Five Guys but boy has it gotten pricey. Two cheeseburgers, one order of regular fries and two sodas for $22??  I'll stick with grilling out."}
{"text":"Based on just the actual burger..this is rightt up there wit in-n-out...the burger has a different taste..but is definitely delicous..for a franchise..the burgers hit the spot. I get the double bacon. They give u many topping options including a1 and grilled onions. Place is very clean. If u havent tried fries wit malt vinegar and ketchup. You should!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. I've heard nothing but great things about their burgers and fries so I figured I might as well try it. I had the bacon cheeseburger and fries. First, that burger had some weight to it, which I had not expected. The first bite all the way to last bite was amazing with every element contributing to it's flavor. The fries were great, definitely the best I had. Employees were friendly, especially the manager, restaurant was clean, and great playlist of background music. Having peanuts there was a plus. I definitely will be returning to eat there again."}
{"text":"Second time through yesterday...

Down grading my review.  There is nothing that stands out to make this place better than just another burger.  

I ordered with different toppings. Stayed simple with Bacon, mushrooms, and of course jalapenos.. Order fries and a drink.  $12.00..  

It was just a burger.  It was o.k. but not worth the $12.00 price. Honestly, Wendy's goes down better for me. Fries are just not doing it for me. I ordered regular. Added lot's of salt and ketchup and that helped.  It must be a taste thing, I just like my fries crispy.

I would still go back if in the area and wanting a burger.  But will also favor the In & Out or other places if I am going that direction instead."}
{"text":"First discovered Five Guys in El Paso while moving from Dallas to Las Vegas.  As soon as we got to Vegas, we said \"We've got to find a Five Guys in Vegas!\"  Wasn't exactly close by....drove 20 miles to get to one.  I'd be hard pressed to break the tie between Five Guys and Fatburger, and I love Fatburger.  

I'm not doubting the validity of the posts by other good yelpers, but my experiences here have always been great.  My burgers haven't fallen apart, I know how to read and understand the difference between \"hamburger\" and \"little hamburger\", and the music is NOT too loud and I'm an old fart at 57.  I've enjoyed Five Guys in 3 different states now and the consistency is solid.

Give 'em a try."}
{"text":"Good burgers but way over rated and over priced. I can enjoy a better burger at Old Orchard's. I still can not understand why they pour fries into the bag."}
{"text":"The burgers are great! The fries are good. The prices are ok. When ordering their french fries be sure to add Cajun spice on them and order 1 or 2 sizes SMALLER than you normally would. A large will literally feed 3 or 4 adults! A great place if you're wanting a \"really good burger\", but it will set 2 people back around $25. That's kinda steep for a mall food court."}
{"text":"had it again.. armed with more knowledge, I ordered, I ate, I enjoyed even more than the first time... upgrading to 5"}
{"text":"Really good burgers, although a but pricey.  Lots of toppings that don't cost extra and free peanuts too."}
{"text":"I had to take this place from 4 to 3 stars because there is too much grease and it sits a little to long in the tummy.  Last time we ate there it felt like our stomachs gazed upon Medusa and turned to stone. Still tasty though!"}
{"text":"First time trying this location and tried out online ordering. Was glad to see they don't cook fries until you pick up. We ordered kind of close to closing so I was a little worried that it might be older patties or something but everything was amazing! They even gave us all the fries they made! Online ordering was super easy and I think this will be our new go to spot when we are wanting something better than fast food."}
{"text":"Did I miss something? Seriously, what's the big deal?

I hear how \"amazing\" it is, and the place is packed so you figure it should be at least really good, right?

A star for atmosphere (minus an over the top loud worker that was obnoxious), and a star for a thick patty, but that's it.

Loses the stars at:
The fries were bad! Soggy and tasted like burnt oil.
 The buns are not good burger buns (squishy, soggy, fall apart- not too far from Fatburger buns).

If you're going to advertise how \"amazing\" your burger is all over your store, you should live up to it. It was just okay. Not bad, but not really good or great. Comparable to a $6 burger from Carl's Jr- in all seriousness (and at least that comes with a fries and a drink for that price).

Um...about $12 for a cheeseburger, fries and a drink...this is a joke, right? No wonder you put your first Vegas location in Anthem.

I tried not to give myself too big of expectations with this place despite all the rave reviews from friends- but big dissapointment."}
{"text":"I seriously can NOT understand how this place is sitting at such a mediocre rating here on Yelp! Five Guys is consistently the best burger on the block, prices are extremely reasonable, and - especially at this location - service has always been wonderful.

Seriously, I've never walked into this place without being cheerfully greeted, I've never yet placed an order with a person who was not smiling back at me, and I have never left the building without the entire crew thanking me for stopping by and waving me off.

If I could give Five Guys on Mill 10 stars, I would do that. It may not be the healthiest choice for food, but if you're craving that messy burger full of delicious flavor that leaves you feeling very well-fed, you just can't beat Five Guys in my humble opinion.

Don't let the negative reviews fool you. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Outstanding service by an older African American woman.  She was so charming, even when I used a $100 bill to pay her.  Food never disappoints"}
{"text":"I used to think that this place was not as good as In'n'Out but after coming here a few times, I have seriously changed that opinion. Meat is corn- or grain-fed (every time I ask I get an \"I don't know but I know it isn't grass-fed.\"), so no 5-star. Veggies are pretty darn fresh, fries are delicious (although nobody has been able to tell me what kind of oil they're fried in yet).

The flavors here are much fresher and more distinct than at In'n'Out. Less of the over-powering fake-cheese and sauce and more of a subtle mix of all the veggies and the beef, which I find to be a much better overall experience. 

Best part: when you ask for fries they fill your cup \"fullish\" with fries, set it in the bag, and \"top it off\" by dumping another entire helping of fries on top of your fry cup. Expect the bottom of the bag to be completely filled with fries regardless of the size you order."}
{"text":"My search for the best burger is over. For a burger that's under 10$. You cannot go wrong with five guys. I know I reviewed the one on West Craig Rd, but I came here recently. Only real difference; they have two coca cola machines instead of two. Obviously they are busier than the Craig Location. But this is as good as it gets. For a soda, a burger and a regular side of cajun style fries. They really do pile on the fries. All that for 12$. You cannot go wrong. I get a Cheeseburger, (two patties), lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, A-1 Steak sauce, and mayo. Im not sure if i never just noticed, but they're grilled mushrooms, come from a can. It kind of tasted rubbery to me, so i usually do not get em on my burger anymore. I know this is a franchise, but hands down, This is what a burger should taste like, I don't think I will ever get tired of this place!"}
{"text":"Food is great and I love that the french fries are cut and made right there. I have to agree, the soda machine is awesome and worth a trip alone even if the food weren't great, but the food is great and should be experienced."}
{"text":"Burger is very sloppily thrown together. However it was very tasty!    Fries need to be crispier.  Cajun fries are the way to go!!    Service is very good!"}
{"text":"What a great hambuger joint, we need more places like this. These guys know how to cook a hambuger. Yes  its a bit pricy, but the taste is worth it. Definitely a favorite stop."}
{"text":"Loved it so good.  The people that worked there were generally very friendly.  I went there at least once a month when I worked out there."}
{"text":"We tried this place after my youngest daughter suggested Five Guys. The place was really clean and had a very casual laid back atmosphere. The peanuts for snacking on while you wait for your order reminded me of Lone Star Steak House when they first opened here in Las Vegas. Our cashier was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the the bacon cheeseburger. It was very good. The Cajun fries made me drink lots of iced tea. I must say that their drink dispenser is awesome. The only draw back to this place is no combos on the menu. Burger, fries, and drink are all ordered separately. Our order came out fast, it was just us until a couple of people walked in later. I give it a four stars because for not having combos."}
{"text":"Been to one other 5GB&F's and hated it.  This one though the food was the same as I had consumed before had a friendly and less utilitarian atmosphere.

Do yourself a favor and get the small order of fries.  A family of potatoes will thank you and so will your guts."}
{"text":"My first experience with Five Guys - As a burger connoisseur I really don't know what took me so long to do . Furthermore, I don't know how anyone can possibly slag this place. Chain or not, they put out a fantastic product in a super fun way.

Think 1950s/60s burger bar focused on the basics and doing them really well with a hyper-focus on customer service. A smaller menu consisting of a burger, cheese burger, bacon cheeseburger, fries and drinks - that's IT! Some would say unoriginal, I say specialists. 

Each burger is cooked perfectly and you can add any or all the toppings they offer for FREE. What I really found remarkable was they have a white board sign near the cash registers which tells you where their farm fresh potatoes are coming from - in a way connecting you to the farmers - very cool!

And as I mentioned earlier, they serve those well done menu items with a big smile and a ton of follow up. In my time waiting I had numerous team members ask me questions to check if I was ok, what number order I was (then letting me know what I already knew - 2, 3, 4, more until my turn (the affirmation while redundant was oddly reassuring, letting me know I hadn't been forgotten about in the busy fray of the lunch rush) and if there was anything else they could do or get me while I waited. Then once I was eating someone walked around and just checked-in, to see if everything was ok! 

Wonderful

And heck, if you're feeling hangry, they've got FREE peanuts while you wait so you can self serve.

Good burgers, Great service. Now, available all over the GTA!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Five Guys the 3 because of the price value of what your are getting. While the food is good, the price is just so high that I would rather go to a restaurant with a server. Hopefully management or corporate will see this review and bring the prices back down to reality. $40 for a 2 year old and 2 adults is entirely too much for a hamburger and greasy fries. Sorry, wouldn't spend money here again unless they come down on their prices."}
{"text":"Been there twice, good experience both times. I really like the fries, the burgers were good as well. I feel prices are just a bit on the high side. I will return."}
{"text":"Love love love this location.
Food is good and so is the service!
Plus the music will usually include some sort of rock which is awesome. 
ALSO this place definitely knows how to do a lettuce wrap!
Thank you five guys!"}
{"text":"Terrible service at noon on a weekday. They skipped my number and it took over 25min to get a single cheeseburger and fry. Manager just shook his shoulders. Will not return."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went to this place a few days ago. We got a cheese burger, a burger, large fries for like $25 after tax. The meat was dry, I mean really dry. Only got a couple pieces of \"grilled\" mushroom (more like steamed mushroom). Not sure why ppl call it \"The best burger in town\". Harveys, Hero Burgers are much better options.

Even the fries portion is quite big and you get free peanuts, I don't think I will go back to this place again, sorry :("}
{"text":"For the most part, place is clean.  They have to clean continuously due to customers making mess on the floors due to the free un-shelled peanuts.  Service is relatively quick.  Staff is friendly.

As a gout sufferer, having an alternative to beef burgers would be nice to see, either a chicken/pork/tofu option.

This was our first experience at a Five Guys, my wife decided on the cheeseburger \"all the way\" for toppings, I opted for a BLT since I didn't have any other option.  I only took a small bite from my wife's cheeseburger since it has been years since I had last tasted a beef made burger.  I'll admit the bite was a very juicy experience as compared to other fast food places having near dry burger patties.  Kudos to Five Guys on the juiciness of the 2 patties that came on the cheeseburger.  Also, kudos on the free refills, other places I've been to only offer 1 refill some places only offer 2.  My wife and I shared 1 regular size, but we refilled 5 times.  For those that like having large reusable cups for drinks, order the Large drink, it is an almost 1 litre plastic glass that can be used at home afterwards.  The extra fries they give are a nice touch as well, since I do like fries, tho I forgot to mention to \"skip\" the salt.

I may give 4 or 5 stars in the future if they offer beef burger alternatives.

As for value of meal I would rate this a $$ place to eat.  Kind of pricey to eat here if you are on a budget.  My wife and I try to eat at places that are at least costing per person at least under $10.00.  Since Five Guys doesn't seem to even offer a basic combo meal, 1 person is looking at over the $10.00 price point, more like $12 - $13 before taxes."}
{"text":"My uncle told us to eat here and he said that it was the \"best burger\" he ever had and that it was better than In-N-Out.

We took him up on it and ate lunch here. With the exception of my mom, who ordered a hot dog (??) we had the little burgers (I got the bacon cheeseburger) and split a large fries among the four of us. The bacon was crispy, the burger was tasty and it was the perfect size (I wondered what the regular burgers looked like...)

We saw the free peanuts bin that my uncle was talking about and my aunty sampled some.

It was neat to see the reviews plastered all over the wall, they reiterated the fact that Five Guys was a really good place to get a burger. They weren't wrong! It was really good."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed....my first time at Five Guys and not sure if it was the chain overall or the location. Service was good, so I'm thinking I'm just an In N Out girl? Ordered a bacon cheeseburger, fries, and drink. Burger was just ok (way too big for me with the double patty, but I thought it'd be a single), fries were not good...just too expensive for what I got"}
{"text":"Five guys is like the Chipotle of hamburgers. It's delicious, it's good quality, you choose all your toppings, and it's fast.

I like Five Guys better than I like McDonald's hamburgers. I find them to be more filling and the toppings remind me of what I would put on at home - ketchup, mayo, fresh white onion, lettuce, tomato. The options are greater than just those & include A-1, jalape√±os, grilled onions, relish, hot sauce, and more.

Five Guys also has Veggie Sandwiches and Grilled Cheeses for those of you who don't care for the meat. A word to the wise - if you have ANY sort of peanut allergy - don't go to a Five Guys! Their fries are cooked in peanut oil and they serve open containers of peanuts right out in the open. The free peanuts remind me of going to Brown Derby way back when and throwing the shells on the ground... but I digress. 

The fries are fresh cut and available in a Cajun variety which is my fry of choice. You can also get your ketchup and vinegar to go - they offer mini to-go cups complete with lid - which I think is fantastic.

Another plus? The Westlake location is one of the stores you can order from online. I haven't tried it - but it seems convenient.

As far as the atmosphere - the music is pretty darn loud and so are the employees. All in all I think Five Guys is a great choice if you're looking for a quick burger that tastes better than Mickey D's."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Exceptional, friendly service at this location. Great place to stop for good food in a hurry."}
{"text":"Stop there often. The harmony with the folks working is so outgoing and in tune with the customer. The peanuts are the best. Burgers always great."}
{"text":"eh.

first of all, this place had been hyped up to me by a couple of people(hubby included) for several days. add that to the fact that parking on Mill's a b*tch, and you will realize why this was such a let-down for me.

now, we'll begin with the pros:
*free peanuts while you wait
*delicious cajun fries
*malt vinegar

...that's about it.

the burger was kind of dry and, I suspect, would have been about as good as, say, McDonalds, had I not added my plethora of toppings. the service took forever(and it was nearly empty in there), and their sh*t is EXPENSIVE.

Lenny's, in Glendale, has them beat. hands down."}
{"text":"With all these specialty burger joints poping up, Five Guy's Burgers just can't compete. I mean, the burgers are just old-fashioned burgers with a patty and ur condiments etc topped with mayonnaise/ketchup. There's really nothing special in my eyes. Yes it is a delicious plain burger but it's nothing to rave about. And the cajun fries were really greasy and tasted salty.. not so much 'cajun.' I would rather go to IN-N-OUT......."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Everyone there was so nice and ready for every customer coming through the door, food was delicious!"}
{"text":"The burgers are fantastic of course and the extra fries thing rules. But there plenty of good burgers in Calgary but the Mission Five Guys has awesome service. They got my order wrong and made it right without any attitude or hard feelings. All businesses make mistakes by its how they fix them that counts and they have a new loyal customer in this guy."}
{"text":"Great juicy burgers and amazing fries at a great value! Five Guys is the standard I set for any burger or fries I eat elsewhere. The staff is friendly and quick with your order. The place is clean, with lots of wooden tables for seating. There's also tables and umbrellas outside for additional seating. This store also has fancy Coke machines. 

The food here is delicious and reasonably priced. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"So I decided to try 5 Guys burgers because I have had so many people tell me how great they are.
$7 for basically a double cheeseburger? It was a decent burger but not a $7 burger, the fries were no better than garden variety fast food, seriously In & out fries are better. Defiantly not worth the nearly $5 price tag since the burgers don't come with fries, like EVERYWHERE else's does.
I tried a hot dog too, it was good tasted like a ballpark or better cut open and grilled so it was definitely a good hot dog, not a $5 hotdog though, as this one set me back nearly that amount.
All in all it's not a bad place the food is defiantly good, just terribly overpriced. For what I spent I could have had a nice meal at Red Robin or other \"sit down\" restaurant where I wouldn't have had to fish my food out of a paper bag."}
{"text":"I've been here twice burgers are alright, fries were soggy each time... kinda pricey. Free peanuts were cool! lol"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch for the first time 8/18/20012.
Sorry, but the place was very messy...food and trash on the floors, open tables were filthy. Music being played at a very loud level, unable to carry on a conversation. The fries were above average for fast food, burger was ok, but they use very little seasoning on the patties. Liked the free peanuts!"}
{"text":"Bien meilleur que McDonald et Burger King niveau fast foot ! Je recommande."}
{"text":"Five guys burgers is definitely one of the best burger joints around. The staff at this location is very friendly and they prepare the food in a timely fashion. The free peanuts are always a plus. As for the food it's always amazing and the portions are sizable."}
{"text":"They have some of the best burgers I have ever had. They are a chain out of the Washington D.C. area. This new location is across from Primanti Brothers in Monroeville. It was very clean and even has update Coca Cola dispensers that let you mix and match flavors, so try to come up with something unique. 

They offer burgers, hot dogs and fries. You can choose from either a hamburger, cheeseburger, bacon burger or a bacon cheeseburger in two sizes a \"little burger\" single patty burger or two patty burger. All toppings are free including: mayo, relish, onions, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, mustard, jalapeno peppers, green peppers, A-1 Sauce, bar-b-q sauce and hot sauce. 

I always get a bacon cheeseburger with mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, green peppers and bar-b-q sauce! YUM 

They also offer kosher style hot dogs, cheese or bacon dogs, bacon cheese dogs, veggie dogs and grilled cheese. 

Fries are available in two styles, regular and Cajun and are cooked in peanut oil. 

Be sure to grab some peanuts while you wait for your food.

I was even asked how everything was as I filled my cup one last time for the short trek home."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Awesome food, friendly wait staff, and always immaculate!  I seek out places that have a high Sanitation Rating, and this place is always over 100%  :)  Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Came in right near open, the restaurant smelled like sewage or dirty mop. The person running the register had never used the register before, which wasn't the problem... the problem was the manager (dude in black shirt) seemed to be getting annoyed that he had to help the guy. The guy told him we were his first order ever and he just walked away and had to keep getting other people to help him. You could visibly see that he was annoyed. The register dude kept apologizing, which I understand... but maybe help the dude vs walking away. 

My wife said the women's room smelled really bad.

Food is great as always!!!"}
{"text":"Wasnt as great as I thought it was. Friends made it seem like it was the most amazing burgers in the world. It wasn't BAD, but wasn't as great as I thought it would be.

I got a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, ketchup, and swiss mushrooms. There was no mushrooms, cant complain because they dont charge for extra condiments, but still got a little disappointed. The burgers weren't that great compared to what the price is. Id rather be eating in n out to be honest. The price is a bit too expensive for what they give. I would assume that the extra price is what makes up for the free toppings.

First time going there and probably wont for awhile. $10 for a burger and a drink. That would equal ten mcdoubles, jus sayin. Typical burgers along with energetic employees and an amazing soda machine. 3 stars for an average place to eat."}
{"text":"The place is really good and clean the only thing is that the burgers are somewhat small but all you have to do is order an extra one and you'll be set otherwise it's really good."}
{"text":"This chain is always good. This particular location was not busy when I went which was nice. I really like that they cook the food fresh for you, it's worth the wait. The staff was very nice, even opened the door for me when I was leaving. Place was clean and nice."}
{"text":"I am not a big fast food person, but was craving a fast burger last night and I wanted to say how awesome this place was.  The three employees working were AMAZING!  I am eating gluten free and asked for my burger with a lettuce wrap rather then a bun.  They inquired if I had an allergy and made special care to change their gloves when making the burger.  I was very impressed.  They have a great variety of toppings for your burger too.  I really wanted to say how great the employees working were though-SUPER friendly!"}
{"text":"We got a gift card as a xmas present (we just received it,lol)
I came on a busy Friday night and expected a long wait-especially since you can order ahead online....well! There was no one in line ahead of me, just a few people waiting on their orders.
I brought my daughter, who zoomed in on the boxes of peanuts and immediately poured a scoop for us. We bought one cup just to try the stellar soda machine; this thing is awesome, you choose on a touch screen which type of drink (coke products, lemonade, powered, etc.), then you choose a flavor for it. Most drinks have more than the usual cherry and vanilla options. We LOVED the peach sprite, tried vanilla root beer, and coke zero cherry/vanilla. Next time we'll try all the fanta flavors.
By the time we finished sampling sodas, our order was ready!
They have a simple menu-just bear in mind, the large burgers are two patties and the small burgers are one. The large fries fed our whole family of three,along with out burgers. We had cajun fries,which were amazing, of the \"steak fry\" variety. My burger was awesome, though I prefer In-n-outs just slightly over this one. They have a big assortment of topping at no extra charge and some option I forget the name, all in or something like that, that is pretty much the works.
All in all I would definitely return alone, with family in tow, or with friends."}
{"text":"Of the few burger joints around the area, I prefer Five Guys. The menu and addition options are bountiful and I enjoy their quality of meat. The fries are amazing when Cajun style and you can even get the Cajun powder on the side. Great!"}
{"text":"Finally, a Five Guys near my house in Henderson. What can I say, consistent burgers. Today, I had it pretty simple... cheeseburger w/mayo, ketchup, mustard, grilled onions and musrooms.... yummy."}
{"text":"What is there to say it's a five guys.
Burgers dogs & fries they are good but not great.
US locations tend to be better.
Fries are greasy 
It's not cheap considering it' just a step above McDonald's or Burger King"}
{"text":"This place is really great, fresh ingredients, and the price is right, similar to in-n-out I think."}
{"text":"Well I thought i was having the best burger ever until I found  hair in my cheese :( melted in and all. The fries are soggy and burnt tasting as well. So sad. I really wanted to like this place. Over all they do have a very friendly staff. Not so sure about the sanitation though."}
{"text":"The burger was tasty, the fries were tasty but this place is a little overpriced for what you get.

While you're waiting for your food, you can eat peanuts that they have sitting around the place.  

If I had to pick between this place and In n Out, I'd pick In n Out."}
{"text":"I only give the place a 3 star rating. Price is king these days and at $10 for a small drink fries and burger, I will take my hard earned money elswhere and not have an overly complex soda machine with touch screen spill liquid all over my hand. Cant comment on the fries because I only had a $10 on me and wanted some change back so I opted for the burger drink and peanuts. wont go back as there are many other more affordable options out there. Sorry guys two thumbs down, way down."}
{"text":"A burger? With anything I want? FINE....I'll do it.

I need no convincing for a burger, fries and a coke (Thanks Carl's Jr.) 

Earleir this afternoon, after a heavy morning of househunting with a couple realtors, I decided to sit my fat backside at a table and eat. And eat well.

I stumbled into the Five Guys at the Fashion Square mall. Not sure how long it's been open. Perhaps it was the grand opening?

It was PACKED! But I digress.

As soon as you get to this location in the food court of the mall, you'll realize that this is not your typical burger joint. They have their own seating separate from the mall-commoners. And their own bathrooms (CLEAN)

You get to the counter and you see a sign telling you about the potatoes they are using for the fries you will be eating.

Ordering your burger isnt a gong show. Fairly easy. All the toppings are listed and all toppings are FREE!

My food was delicious. Got a burger with some of my favorite toppings: onions, tomatoes, etc. 

The fries reminded me of an experience I had back in high school, when I held a girls hand for the first time. Soft, perfect and lovely. That's how these fries felt. Ok that sounded weird. Tough.

Oh, I forgot to mention that the soda fountains had COKE ZERO!! EFFING AWESOME! I MEAN THIS IS THE MOST DOPE SODA EVER!! 

(I'm really hoping this Kanye yelping phase ends soon, since my reviews make me seem like a bigger Jackass than I seem in person).

Ultimately, I left this place happy, satisfied and I will come back again.

Oh...the answer to the one question in everyone's mind? YES, BETTER THAN IN-N-OUT!"}
{"text":"Five Guys is the perfect destination in the east end for an American style, never frozen, cheese burger. The toppings are fresh and plentiful.

I usually go for the standard ketchup, lettuce, tomato, onion, mustard, and relish. I also go for a little hamburger, but the cheese is nice melty processed, perfect for this kind of burger.

The fries are delicious and plentiful. Cajun seasoning is nice, but unnecessary.

Not a place for people with a nut allergy."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch. We have talked about trying it out since some people talk so highly of the place. 24.00 for two cheeseburgers, one regular fry and two drinks? That is ridiculous.  Their regular fry size is a waste of food for two people. Their cheeseburgers? Completely bland even with the A1 sauce added. 

We don't see the big deal about the food. Highly disappointed and won't be going back."}
{"text":"5 guys has learned that the old saying of \"do one thing and do it well\" pays off. They offer bugers with a multitude of toppings for the most part, but you can get a few other diner staples as well. A family fav, but we do not go too often because it is a little pricey (but, as always you get what you pay for). The burgers really are mouth watering chunks of heaven, juicy and packed with flavor. All of the toppings are always fresh (and you can order extra amounts of any topping). Now on to the fries...good Lord the fries!!! The amount of fires they give you is almost ridiculous, our family of 3 easily shares a small. They are always fresh and delicious. Bottom line.....if you are really hungry and want a great burger, look no further than 5 Guys...yum!"}
{"text":"Have been to many Five Guys across several states....this was the first one that did NOT have cheese sauce for the fries.  Really?  Are you just out?  No, we don't ever have cheese sauce.   My heavens, then how or why can you call yourself a Five Guys?    Burger was greasy and yummy, fries were a tad overcooked.....as always way overpriced for what you get, but when travelling or when we have company, this is one of the places we go when someone wants a really greasy yummy burger.    I live about 30 minutes away from this one, and shop nearby often.....but never again will I eat here if they don't feel cheese sauce on the fries is important.  Hello In n Out down the street....half the cost, just as yummy, less greasy (which is probably healthier), and while they have no cheese sauce, they do have their secret sauce packets!"}
{"text":"Cajun fries! Love 'em.  My favorite burger joint (and yes, I've been to In 'n Out). Wear a sweater if you're eating in; they blast the air conditioning here when it's warm outside (Vegans love their ac)."}
{"text":"A lot if people spoke highly of the burgers here so I decided to give this place a shot. Usually when I go to a new restaurant I tend to get something that's familiar to me and evaluate how they make it.

For this one I got a bacon cheeseburger and that was going to be it but my friend insisted on including fries since they're also good so I got fries too. 

I was not impressed, the burger itself was nice and fat but it was also really sloppy and the taste didn't leave an impression on me, but I can let that slide because it might have just been that burger.

The fries however did not do it for me at all, I hate fries that rely too much on seasoning and I just couldn't finish them because of it, perhaps it would have been better if I added ketchup but at least my friend enjoyed the fries.

Overall for a first impression it wasn't that good, however I do intend on giving it a second chance in the future and see if perhaps I just had a bad order that day."}
{"text":"Smaller than other Five Guys places but a great burger nonetheless.  I don't remember spending $28 for 2 adults and a child but maybe I'm just not remembering right.  Seemed high but we still enjoyed our meal.

If you like Five Guys in general this place doesn't disappoint.  Great staff, great food and I love all the variety of sodas.  

If you've never had five guys, their burgers are awesome.  It is super greasy, however.  I personally like In and Out better but my husband like's Five Guys.  I don't usually pick a burger joint when it is my turn to choose where we're going to eat so it has been a while since we've been to an I/O but the husband is extremely happy to have a Five Guys in the area.

You should definitely try this place if you are curious.  You can judge for yourself since everybody has a different idea of what a good burger should taste like.  Oh yeah, and they have a variety of toppings you can put in the burger - a definite plus.  The \"junior\" sizes is PLENTY.  The regular size I think is the same; they  just double the patty."}
{"text":"Here, There & Everywhere. S√≠, donde sea que vayan y encuentren un local de la cadena Five Guys van a poder comer de las mejores hamburguesas del mundo. Posta que cada vez estoy m√°s convencido de eso, cada vez que las vuelvo a probar me gustan m√°s y no me quedan dudas de que son lo mejor de la vida.

Este local en particular que se encuentra en Las Vegas est√° m√°s que copado, es grande, amplio, luminoso y tranquilo, encima ayuda que no este en el centro del quilombo, sino un poco m√°s alejado y eso lo hace mucho m√°s satisfactorio si es que se quieren alejar del tumulto de gente. Por otro lado, la atenci√≥n es muy buena en esta sucursal.

Para los que nunca fueron a Five Guys tienen que saber que esta es la hamburguesa m√°s rica que existe: el sabor de la carne, la magia del queso y ese hermoso y crujiente bacon, encima les pueden agregar sin cargo todos los toppings que quieran. Ni hablar del plus de las papas fritas, las m√°s deliciosas y abundantes que vayan a probar en sus vidas. En fin, sean felices y vayan a comer ac√° que es lo mejor del universo."}
{"text":"I love coming to this five guys! It is a great spot and service is usually pretty decent. Sometimes there is a decent line."}
{"text":"Today I had my 1st experience with 5 Guys and was hugely disappointed. I ordered my bacon cheeseburger (plus 5 toppings since they are all free) and fries and waited in anticipation of my delicious meal. Not only did I have to wait 30 minutes for my order to be ready for me to take with me to eat (since I ordered it to go) but when I had my 1st bite I realized that they only placed 2 toppings on the burger (forgot the other 3) and forgot the bacon that I paid extra for. To say the least I was hugely disappointed and went on to tell all my co-workers what a huge let down it was. I would have walked back and asked them to fix my order but since I didn't have another 30 minutes to wait for 5 Guys to attempt to make it correctly I tossed what I was given.

I do not anticipate that I will ever eat at 5 guys again since I have another burger place (i.e. Fatburger) to choose from that can get my order right that is only a few steps further from my place of work. Thanks for ruining my lunch 5 Guys and for charging me extra for nothing!!!"}
{"text":"Updating my previous review. This place has gone way downhill. I would have given zero stsrs, but I decided to give one star because the burgers are still occasionally good WHEN you can wake up the lethargic staff long enough to get one made. They are SLOW, SLOW, SLOW, and when the order finally comes up, it is WRONG. Then they unapologetically start the whole SLOW process all over again. This all happening today while there was only one other customer in the place! The three guys who were working there today acted like they were on downers. I used to go to Five Guys and pay a little more for their burgers than the run of the mill places because they were good, but now is just not worth the frustration.I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The best burgers! love coming here to have a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Unlike most visitors to this type of restaurant, I tried the grilled cheese.  I can safely say that the $3 I paid was too much for what I got.  Two burger bun tops slapped together with nasty processed cheese in the centre?  It was gooey is a gross way and made my stomach upset the moment I ate it.

I contacted head office to find out about their allergen menu...  and then I contacted them again... and again. Three times and not one email back!  Talk about shitty customer service!  Well, what would I expect of a store that stores bags of peanuts out in the open and suggests that those with peanut allergies, \"...don't come.\"  (http://fiveguys.ca/en/about-us/faq.aspx#faqSection-2213)

If you want a GOOD, BETTER, BEST burger experience, hit up Hero Certified Burgers. Heads and shoulders above 5guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries.  Pile on the things you want.  The more you pile on, the bun will fall apart and toppings end up everywhere.  Fries are always overflowing in the bag.  Large is definitely a large.  Cajun fries are spicy but it's up to your taste.  They do have open peanuts as a snack and they do cook with refined peanut oil so if you or someone has a serious peanut allergy be careful.  I have a mild peanut allergy and it doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"Any place that can make me a made to order burger fresh and have it ready to stuff in my face in less than two shakes is a-ok in my book.  Five Guys Burgers and Fries has a wide open kitchen where you can see the hustle and bustle of your burger cooked from start to finish.  The crispy bacon is sitting in a HUGE basket ready to go.  (Aside, I'd love a bacon basket in my kitchen.)  The burger guy is grillin', flippin' and scrapin' non-stop.  The fry guy literally has 10 baskets going from prep to fry to rest.  

We ordered \"little\" bacon cheeseburger with \"everything,\" which means, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickles, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup and mustard.  Keep in mind \"little\" only means 1 beef patty vs. 2 for the regular burger.   We also shared ordered a regular sized order of CAJUN fries.  Always a fan of any cajun seasoning, we ordered those over the regular five guys fries.   As I watched them layer all the ingredients fresh and wrap it up, I hoped that they wouldn't let it sit too long and let things get soggy.  Soggy texture is not my favorite texture at all.  Happy me, they quickly packed up and delivered everything in a bag that we ripped open immediately to devour the food.

The bite of all the fresh ingredients was fantastic, however, here are my two gripes:
- I wish that they toasted the bun because I like my bread toasty and able to hold all the wet ingredients to the very last bite.
- I wish that the fresh cut potato fries were extra crispy.  I think that being so thick and fresh they release too much moisture and end up limp and soggy.

Conclusion:  I love that there are so many extra ingredients to add to your burger and the staff is super efficient in delivering the food."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries.  Great staff.  But they seriously need to get rid of those chairs that are SOOOO LOUD when they scrape against the floor.  Seriously."}
{"text":"As you walk through the doors your subconscious mind is immediately bombarded by reviews from other states about just how great this place is.

That coupled with the red and white decor makes it an incredible mind control weapon.  I tried to just stay focused and besides who needs to reminded about Zagat when you have Yelp?

For a Friday afternoon this place was hopping.  People were loud and the music was even louder. 

I ordered up the Bacon Cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushrooms.

The burger was not to shabby at the time that I ate it. But as the day wore and my body attempted to digest it, I wondered if I had found a replacement for Tylenol PM. 

Two people need only order the regular size fries.  I made them cajun flavored.  I am ashamed to admit that we could not finish the fries.

Glad to have tried but the hype was just a tad to much."}
{"text":"The first time I ever had Five Guys was at the Reagan Airport.  I didn't get to it until an hour later and it was still delicious.  Been to this location twice and every time going there hits the spot.  Sharing a medium order of fries with a friend is PLENTY and their mini-sized burgers are just right.  Guys will probably like the \"regular\" ones since they come with two patties.  My husband was skeptical when I took him to this place but now he requests it ... and we have to drive to Scottsdale all the way from Buckeye!"}
{"text":"Food is alway Great. The staff very friendly!!! Always has smile which goes a very long way. 
They had one young man working there......WOW so impressed I wish I had his name. He could not stop cleaning the dining room and just could tell he was happy to have a job. I don't like to describe people by their ethnicity but the only way they may know who this young gentlemen is, is by me letting them know he is a young african american man. I have to say it take a lot for me to be impressed but I could not stop admiring this gentleman's working skills. 

Congratulations Five Guys Management, for serving good food, and a strong team."}
{"text":"Just paid $15 for mediocre burger and fries. Very sad. I live a good burger and don't mind paying for it but this is a poor choice. You have a lot of other choices in Ajax - I'd make a different one. Wendy's burgers are better. They advertise all beef as a selling point - very sad - so does McDonald's."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never reviewed Five Guys! They have some of the best burgers I have ever had. They are a chain out of the Washington D.C. area. This is the first Five Guy's in the Pittsburgh area. It is right up the street from the O. 

They offer burgers, hot dogs and fries. You can choose from either a hamburger, cheeseburger, bacon burger or a bacon cheeseburger in two sizes a \"little burger\" single patty burger or two patty burger. All toppings are free including: mayo, relish, onions, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, mustard, jalapeno peppers, green peppers, A-1 Sauce, bar-b-q sauce and hot sauce. 

I always get a bacon cheeseburger with mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, green peppers and bar-b-q sauce! YUM 

They also offer kosher style hot dogs, cheese or bacon dogs, bacon cheese dogs, veggie dogs and grilled cheese. 

Fries are available in two styles, regular and cajun and are cooked in peanut oil. 

Be sure to grab some peanuts while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great place to fulfill your guilty pleasures, this is it.  I only wish my they didn't use peanut oil because someone in my family has an allergy to it. best burgers and fries around."}
{"text":"Parking is the major issue at this place. Burger King, for obvious reasons, put up huge signs threatening to tow people who parked in their lot to go to Five Guys. There are probably 20 parking spaces. 

The food is good, unhealthy for sure, but tasty. I can not make it through a 'regular' burger which is two hunks of meat, but the small burger works out well. There is no need to get more than a large order of fries for 3 or 4 people since they fill the fry container and then a huge portion of the bag. My only criticism about their menu is the lack of options for children. They offer grilled cheese, which is their regular buns with cheese and whatever else you want on there but it is rather pricey. In fact the entire menu is a little on the steep side for burgers and fries, but it is worth it for a treat every once in a while."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here for lunch yesterday. Menu is not clear about single vs double burgers, we thought the little burgers were for kids. Very expensive meal at $27 for two burgers, fries, and drinks. Everyone here was friendly and it did not take long to be served. I was surprised by the amount of French fries that we got, the small size would have been enoug for two people. We both likes the fries, I got Cajun and wife got regular, but felt there was way too much salt. The burgers tasted ok but after a few bites I noticed that mine was rare, nobody asked me how well I wanted the meat and I assumed they would be cooked to medium at least. We both thought In and Out burgers were much better but preferred Five Guys French fries."}
{"text":"Food: 5 stars
The 5 star's I'm giving this place is basically all for the food. The picture does not do this place's burger justice. I've been here before, and felt that there was nothing special, until one time i ordered the burger with just mushroom, onions and ketchup. It was delicious, i was able to taste the patty and how amazing it is. Without a ton of condiments, which is what i did in the past, i finally enjoyed what the burger had to offer. Its so far the best medium priced fast food burger I've ever had! (Not to compare with sit down restaurants that are much more expensive) 
You get to choose between cajun or regular fries, always go for the cajun, its a must try. Its freshly cut and fried to a nice crisp. Of all the time i've been here, there was only one time their fries weren't cooked well. 
The only short coming is that they don't have gravy, but o wells, burger's still good :) 

Price: 4 stars 
Its decent pricing, a whole combo would cost around 10-12 dollars depending on how much extra stuff you add, it's reasonable imo. 

Service: 4 stars
Fast food's fast food, doesn't really matter, as long as they don't swear at me i'm good.

Location/ambiance: 3 stars
Its a fast food joint, it's not nicely lit enough for my liking, not really clean either, but i'm not going to hold that to then. As long as the food's clean i'm good :) 

Parking: 5 stars
Huge parking lot on a new plaza, i doubt it's been ever full!"}
{"text":"Not a bad burger joint. You can have the burger any way you want it and there is a large selection of toppings. 

It's a fun atmosphere in the restaurant and the staff is friendly and seems to enjoy working.

This is definately better than most of the nation wide fast food chains."}
{"text":"This place launched me into a food depression and exacerbated my In-N-Out withdrawal. Being from the SF Bay Area, I had never heard of Five Guys, but after moving to the Cleveland area, I was told that this was the best burger around. I had been desperately searching for good food since moving away from the culinary mecca of the United States. We arrived at Five Guys with high hopes. It even kind of looked like In-N-Out! I was getting excited! But then we got our food and we were brought back to reality. It was the soggiest burger I have ever had. The bun pretty much disintegrated before I finished the burger. the fries were also lacking. Putting fries in a cup may look cool, but it steams the bottom half and they end up just as soggy as the burger. But even the fries on top were nothing compared to some In-N-Out well done fries. The overall price was also on the high side for the quality of food that you get. Maybe I am being too hard on Five Guys because I have had the privilege of tasting the heavenly creation known as the In-N-Out Double Double, but when a restaurant is known as \"the In-N-Out of the east coast,\" I can't help but compare."}
{"text":"Totally agree with Travis above. In my opinion, and that's really just what it is, what we like and dislike individually, is that their burgers are not that great. Their okay after drinking a lot of beer on State Street, but they lack something, that special flavor, I can't pinpoint it, but I just find them kind of bland. I mean I do like a greasy burger now and then, it's just needs to have flavor. Sorry, don't hate on me!!
Kissy."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. I live in California & they r great. So I decided 2 try this 1. Bad idea, I guess they only cater 2 people that dine in. I ordered a regular cheeseburger & was given a double.  I said that is not what I want. It was a long exhausting argument but didn't take the burger back. The fries were so greasy that the bag tore when I got home. I Didn't eat all of the burger even though it was good, it was 2 much. No one told me that i needed to get my own ketchup. In California they give u ketchup, so yes, I had fries w/ No ketchup. I have no idea where all the reviews came from but I will not go back there."}
{"text":"The only thing comparable to In-N-Out here is the decor. The food, price, and options just aren't similar enough for a real comparison.

What I really like at Five Guys is the ability to pick any and all of the toppings and not have to pay extra, with the exception of bacon and cheese. The regular size left me disappointed as it is simply two patties from the \"little\" size, and not a thicker, juicier patty (as Carl's Jr. does with their regular and \"$6 burger\" versions). I much prefer the \"little\" size as the meat/veggie ratio is more ideal. The cajun fries also disappointed me as they are simply regular fries with seasoned salt thrown on them.

Now, as I am originally from California, and since everyone is making that annoying comparison I might as well put in my .02 for potential customers. The buns feel store-bought, fresh from the bag on Aisle 6, not the toasted ones of INO. The fries are pretty good - typical more of a restaurant than of fast food (though I really like INO fries). There are no shakes. =( It is not as cheap as INO, but close to the same value. You pay more but get more. If you're like me, a fan of toppings (peppers, bbq sauce, grilled onions and mushrooms at no extra charge), you will love this place. If you prefer the subtle freshness and simplicity of INO you will not find that here.

Right now I couldn't place 5G above INO, nor could I place it below. They each have their strengths and weaknesses. If 5G offered the sweet potato fries from down the street, had better buns and/or offered shakes, I would rate them above INO."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers with a  large selection for toppings.   Great tasting fries with a generous portion even for their little size.   Just wish that those fries didn't feel like they were just fished our of the ocean because the knucklehead employee had drenched them  in salt.   Haven't they heard that salt is to be highly avoided by all?   Ended up spending twice as much as In n Out Burger and they had a tip jar out.    Fast foods and tip jar?  WTH!
Premises were very clean."}
{"text":"So of course there is kind of buzz that preceeded 5G's before they hit Vegas. And the opening business levels and through to now still seems pretty strong. Being as much a burger addict as anyone else I have been there a few times now. All-in-all, for me, it's a 3-star experience. They hang their hat on fresh ground beef and fresh potatoes for the fries (of which you get a huge amount of, even with the smallest size), much as In/Out does. Burgers are good but nothing extraordinary. I would have to place Fatburger easily ahead of them, and even In/Out which are much less costly. In the end I don't find it living up to its hype which is proudly displayed in numerous quotes and reviews all over there walls. For me, memerable food is the type I will pass similar establishments by when driving to get to. I would not make a decision to not got there as much as would not make one to go there. If it closest when the urge hit, so be it. 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"Two words: Cajun Fries.

You definitely cannot go wrong with the Cajun Fries here. They also overload the fries in the bag which is the Five Guys way. However, the Cajun Fries do outshine the burgers.

I usually get the cheeseburger which has double patty. There is nothing too special about the burger. Just an average burger from a fast food burger place. At least they make it fresh after you order and you have the usual condiments like ketchup, mayo, lettuce, tomato, etc.

There is nothing special about the decor and interior. Just the Five Guys decor. At least the employees keep it clean when I observed them wiping down tables when I was there.

If you are looking for a quick bite, this is the place to go and get the CAJUN FRIES!"}
{"text":"This place has some really delicious burgers.  The location is pretty good and will be great for the new hospital that is being built at the corner of Harvard and Richmond.  The people working here are really nice, if just a tad slow for takeout orders.

The portions are absolutely huge.  A Jr burger is larger than most burgers in the area.  The regular burger is two huge patties.  The small fry is easily enough for two people and the large fry is ridiculous.  

All told, it's an a-ok place.  The last time I ate here was about two weeks ago and I think I am still working off the burger."}
{"text":"A perfectly good burger and fries. Nothing outstanding though, just a good, hand-formed patty and decent fries. They fill your cardboard pouch in fries and then top up the bag with more fries, almost like they had too many so they had to do something with the extras. The topping selection is quite extensive although when I asked for mushrooms I was expecting more. At first I thought they had skipped them by chance and didn't think anymore about it, until one miniscule piece of mushroom fell out of my burger. Not too impressive. The regular burger is a two patty deal, which tops out at almost $15 as a combo with drink and fries, and unless you're really hungry, you would probably be fine with the single patty version and save a few dollars. I found the salt level in the patty somewhat lacking and adding salt on top doesn't quite have the same effect as having it added before the meat is cooked (or during). Overall a nice experience eating at this restaurant, pleasant service and a clean dining area with a great view out the windows, almost like a solarium (see my picture)."}
{"text":"Every time I pass by this Five Guys location, I can just smell the burgers and it taunts me. This time around, when I entered Five Guys, their music wasn't blaring loud like it has been the last couple of times I've been here. I ordered a cheeseburger with two patties and regular fries. The cashier kept asking if I really wanted regular fries (because there's quite a bit of fries attached to it) and warned me how many fries were in regular fries, but I wanted it. I knew I wasn't going to finish the fries by myself, and I didn't, but I have someone else to give my leftovers to so I wasn't worried.

My cheeseburger and fries were delicious. Greasy, but delicious. My only issue is that, since I took my order to go, my burger was covered by my fries so I had to dig in to grab it and that meant my hand was covered in grease. If my burger had been in one bag while the fries were in the other, that would have been great. Also, by the time I got home, the grease soaked through the bag and got everywhere. Still, the way the food tastes is worth it. Next time, I just gotta ask for two bags or the fries double bagged."}
{"text":"The management is off the hook they take care of a problem if there is one even if it's your fault the lady was really nice  Claudia Your hamburger is a delicious bit of fun  with a wonderful Greece and tasty Greece but I say Greece but don't worry it's the good kind of Greece and I know there's no good kind of Greece but if there had to be one this will be at the grill looks like it has taste built up on that restaurant appears to be clean from all aspects fairly well-maintained

 did not greet at the door but that's OK the guy made up for it as soon as he found out I was a yelper     He gave us an extra drink and said sorry about the wait the food is phenomenal you know it stop if you're even trying to say it's not stop to stop good visit down here in Phoenix working out of town love this place"}
{"text":"I've been to Five Guys several times, and I have no issues with the food especially their milkshakes! Try the strawberry milkshake with extra whipped cream and you won't be disappointed; there are actual bits of strawberry in it! But let's talk about the set up. As expected, this restaurant is smaller than most Five Guys restaurants because it's located in the city. Understandable. What I don't understand is why the left door is an 'Exit' only door. You have to enter the right door just to walk to the left side of the store to order your food, because pick up is on right. Like what? Other than this setup, great service and good food."}
{"text":"Not the worst place ever, but the burgers must have a ton of preservatives and chemicals in them as I feel dizzy and lazy after eating them.  It's as though I had Americanitis.  With the Priest around the corner, and Big Butcher near there, I don't want to go back."}
{"text":"One & done at 5 Guys.

Burger was over cooked and rather tasteless, fries delivered cold. Way over priced if the food was good, ridiculous at this quality level.

Emailed corporate and they never bothered to reply."}
{"text":"As iv said for the Old Port location - this place is amazing!  The only difference is this location will be a lot more grimey than the Old port one especially on weekends and even the occasional pan handles.  

But its worth it!"}
{"text":"Burgers are one of a kind (for fast food) and unbelievably customizable.

Fries are great and made with peanut oil.  They fill up the fries in that fry duo thing all the way over the top and then they dump it in your bag, fill up one more and place it in!
They taste great and you get a tonne?  You better because its like 15 bucks for a drink, fries and a burger.

Nonetheless I come over and over again!  Not 5 star because of price, but hey its all about demand I guess."}

{"text":"I was not greeted with a smile, just the mumble of \"can I help you?\" I placed my order, then both soda fountains were out of most everything so I let the staff know. They seemed a bit irritated that something was said about it. The machines were also very dirty with dried up soda all over them. One machine was also out of ice. Meanwhile, lines were forming at the fountains with unhappy customers because they could not get drinks at this point, or once they realized that there was. I carbonation, or ice, or a selection for that matter. Hopefully the food is better."}
{"text":"Such a good burger!! So juicy and delicious!! Lots of choices and they are all... FREE (except for a select few)!! Their fries are OK. I prefer in-n-outs better, but I'll live. My biggest complaint is the price. It takes longer than any fast food joint to get your burger and it's double the price. Yes, they are delicious, but it's still just a burger. I do really like the fact that they have peanuts to snack on while you're waiting! That does help."}
{"text":"Delicious, as always. 

Loss of star because they do not have nutritional information available. We just started a Keto diet and are trying to better inform our choices. Also the lady at the front counter shouted \"what can I get for you today\" as soon as we walked in. 30 seconds later, when we got to the counter to view the menu, we were able to have that conversation. Sheesh!"}

So don't even bother calling ahead because you'll still have to wait in line, then once you pay, they start making it behind everyone else's order even though you requested food 20min ago. I though the point of carry out was to come in, pay, and leave just like every other food place out there."}
{"text":"I really love five guys but 3 our of 5 times this location goes cheap on the fries . Five guys fri orders are supposed to be overflowing not a few over the cup.."}
{"text":"So, the employees seemed very upset for some reason. Not sure why, but they put off an unwelcoming/hostile vibe. Didn't get any kind of greeting from them, just spurts of eye contact. Then a couple minutes later when they finally did show acknowledgement, it was just a \"what can I get cha?\". How hard is it to say \"hi\" guys?! 

Right in the midst of placing the order with the cashier, the male employee yells to the female cashier \"we're outta tomatoes!\", to which she replied \"I guess I'll just go in the back and cut one then?\". Now I see where those hostile vibes were coming from. It was obvious those two didn't get along very well and also that they did have tomatoes, he was just too lazy to go cut one up.

Needless to say, after the 10 minute wait (actually pretty good for five guys to be honest) the bag of food gets plopped on the counter. Said \"thanks\" to the guy and he rolled his eyes and walked away. Said \"thanks\" again because maybe he didn't hear it the first time and the dude just kept walking away. That was just flat out rude.

Got home and the burger is sloppy, soggy, lacked the A1 that was requested to be added to the burger and ultimately lacked any notable flavor whatsoever.  The Cajun fries had a thick coat of Cajun and were just waaay too over seasoned to eat. 

Boyfriend was super disappointed because he's never had a bad experience at five guys. He will probably try other locations before totally giving up on this chain, but will never be returning to this one."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal, bad service or a bad experience in any way in the dozens of times I have eaten at the Middleton Five Guys. 

Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Great service, wonderful location and awesome burgers!!! Everything is \"made to order\" and fresh. The staff is friendly and always so helpful. Love there burgers and there fries are so yummy. Every time I am craving a burger, this is my go to place. Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I love five guys the only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because when you order carryout I can't stand when they pour the fries on top of the packed burgers. I know it is silly but it annoys me. The burgers are so good and the fries amazing. The Cajun fries so good. I love the cheeseburger all the way."}
{"text":"I really LOVE Five Guys!!!

Freshly prepared food, customized any way you want it AND ridiculous portions...sign me up!

I walked in and the staff was super helpful and very polite! I ordered a hot dog with a side of little fries. And don't let the wording fool you...a \"little\" is more than enough for a filling meal. 

One of the things I love most about this place is that they use FRESH jalape√±os!! That really adds the perfect amount of heat to your meal.  And I agree with Tonya P, load up your hotdog with the jalape√±os, onions and mustard and you have a real winner!!!! I also really enjoy the fries, they are seasoned well and are always dropped fresh so they are piping hot. 

Mmmmm...Mmmmmm....Very good!!! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great Burger!! comparable to In-n-Out. the fries are fresh and very tasty. A small order of fries was good enough for two people."}
{"text":"i usually have a decent experience with most Five Guys locations, but not so sure about this one. i had to repeat my order three times to the cashier and after receiving my order, i realized she got it wrong anyway."}
{"text":"Here is the deal, in addition to the metal chairs screeching on the tile floor constantly, and the head banging extra loud music, the guys behind the counter are now pretending they are Dave from storage wars and calling out an annoying YUPPP every twenty seconds. Two locations in Vegas now, two yup callers, it has made what used to be a fun burger joint into a place that is so annoying and loud, you can hardly wait to get out of there. What happened to management? The food still killer, just wear ear plugs."}
{"text":"Serving order number meh today ladies and gentlemen. 
I gave this place a second chance hoping to like it, hoping that something had improved, hoping that maybe the cooks had transfered some of the seasoning from the over seasoned cajun fries to the underseasoned hamburger meat. 
Let's start with this. There were only 5 people in line ahead of me and maybe a dozen sitting down. Definitely different from the lunch crowd filled with military men from three weeks ago. I did get a listen to the music that some yelpers have complained about. It wasn't loud but it was annoying to have in the background. 
The one perk of the day was that there was a hot guy taking orders.  I told him that he should be a male stripper and he turned 12 shades of red.
Okay so instead of the tasteless burger that I got last time I decided to try the hot dog. It was $4.29 for just the hot dog. I put a bunch of toppings on it and it was as flavorless as the burgers. They slice it and half and grill it. I was expecting a regular roundness to the hot dog. I do not like my hot dogs cooked like that so I traded it for 1/2 of the bacon cheeseburger that my friend ordered. It was thoroughly cooked and topped correctly but was so greasy that the bun was falling apart in my hand. Lots and lots of greasy fries were okay, but nothing special. 
I have given this place two tries now. I give them credit for trying but this place just isn't for me. 
Oh...just an added note. Unlike my first visit/review there were only three people in uniform were having lunch this time."}
{"text":"Seriously everyone should know the wonders of five guys by now!! I never go to fast food joints and when I do I hate it or a feel horrible after. However, I will go to five guys anytime. There burgers are excellent. The flavor and quality is always there and you can not forget about the fresh cut potato french fries that they have. There prices are higher than those of your normal burger joints but the quality is much better and they give you a lot for you money. I usually stay with the small burger. Even though I am a big eater the big burger is too much for me. A small order of fries is also good for two people. They also have free peanuts for when you are waiting on your order. If for some reason you have not been to Five Guys then your seriously missing out. Go try it!"}
{"text":"It was just okay, nothing special. I  did like that they had malt vinegar on the table for the fries. For the price I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Pricey for a burger and fries. Although the fresh cut fries were good, the price just ruins it for me. Service was fine. The dining room had a lot of dirty tables."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of fried burgers, and I gotta say the burger was weak, no flavor to it.  Was as if you bought a package of ground beef, put it in a frying pan at home and didn't season it at all.  Best Burger in Jacksonville they advertise?!?  Thanks, now I know I don't need to ever visit Jacksonville.  Actually, they have signs ALL OVER the place touting themselves . . . ya know, you could take down the signs and let the food speak for itself, but . . . yeah you can't let the burger speak for itself when the burger sucked.  Let's put up more signs!

The toppings options were awesome.  I can't see myself going back for a burger, but the toppings might get me in to try a hot dog"}
{"text":"Ehhh, it was a burger, nothing special, looked like they threw it together, a little messy.. . Service wasn't great, pretty much threw my food at me..won't go back"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 
Almost like a fancy version of McDonald's which is not bad in terms of taste and quick service. However, I still can't justify the price to the quality of the burger. Will be back for a quick bite but won't cry a river if I was lost in a  island..."}
{"text":"lot i don,t like about the place....is boring place, hard seats, just not much money put into the seats, etc...no boths, at least in n out have boths, but they are plastic...still better than none....

okay , the food...the fries are not bad, but the burger just did not taste that good...only ate about half of it...expensive, but portions are big..........probably will not return"}
{"text":"Fast food au top! Les burgers sont certes plus ch√®rs qu'au mcdo mais bien meilleurs ! 
Lors de notre commande nous devons choisir le type de burger (cheese burger par exemple) puis la garniture qui l'accompagnera (tomate, salade, cornichon, mayo ...), ensuite les burger sont pr√©par√©s sous nos yeux. Les frites natures ou √©pic√©es sont √©galement tr√®s bonne."}
{"text":"Five guys burger is amazing.  I love their burgers and Cajun fries.  The burger itself was very tasty and juicy.  Little hamburger is 1 patty and the normal hamburger is 2 patties.  They do not tell you that on the menu which doesn't make any sense.  The Cajun fries portion is huge, they not only fill up the cup but they put more in the paper bag. The line up is blocked off by bags stack of potatoes which is kind of funny.  They offer you free peanuts while you wait.  I do advise you to help yourself with the peanuts as wait time can be longer than your average burger joint.  Def will be back shortly.  The only thing I hate about Five guys is that they do not offer you a combo option.  You have to order fries and drink individually and can really be expensive.

{"text":"My friend and I had an overnight layover in Phoenix while flying across the country. Luckily my friend has family in the area so we asked them to show us around and maybe try some good ol' Southwest grub. They all said we had to try Five Guys Burgers and Fries. So after making the trek over to Tempe we finally arrived. Meh... When we said Southwest grub we didn't have fast food in mind. Plus I've now heard there are Five Guys locations all over the place.

Living in Southern California, amazing fast food burger joints isn't a new thing to me. After trying Five Guys I'll gladly stick to Tommy's or In N Out."}
{"text":"For some reason, a lot of people on other food review sites like to complain about Five Guys.  I don't get it.  I think people are expecting too much and not realizing that this is a FAST FOOD place.  If you want frilly foo-foo burgers for $30, go elsewhere.  If you want excellent fast food burgers and fries, Five Guys is your place.  There isn't a better fast food burger in the world."}
{"text":"I rarely like to rate chain restaurants but this one deserves a special mention!

Last Thursday had one of those must have cheeseburger \"attacks\". Not the slim diet conscious ones but a real one, if you know what I mean. So decided to give this Five Guys location a try. Proceeded to the counter to order and was astounded at the number of topping choices available... luckily there was the all dressed option saut√©ed mushrooms, delicious caramelized oignons, lettuce, tomato and everything you would need to which I added some jalape√±o peppers.

While waiting for my order had the pleasure of munching on some roased peanuts (nice touch). Interestingly, everything is made fresh to order - no silly microwaved food or pre-cooked patties to be found! 

All in all the burger experience at Five Guys was surprisingly tasty and it always helps when you are greeted by a very friendly and personable staff that also keep the please really clean & tidy - impressive! Must come again, but not too often as someone would say, to not spoil the experience!"}
{"text":"Wow. Some of the best burgers ever! The fresh cut fries are my favorite. I always get the lime Coke. My girl says they definitely have the best burgers."}
{"text":"Ate at this Five Guys location last Friday (August 2nd) this was my second time there.  I took my husband who had never tried Five Guys before.  I had a \"little\" cheesburger with cajun fries and he had the regular burger with regular fries (he's just a regular kinda guy......)  It is pricey, our total came to $28 with two soda fountain pops.  There is something to be said however for the ambience, there's lots of \"upbeat\" people working here and smiles all around.  Our burgers were really great, no complaints at all, fries were also really good and fresh, of course we couldn't eat all of them, we should have shared a regular sized portion.  All in all I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fresh burger experience!"}
{"text":"The first time I went in here they had peanuts all over the floor.  Since I walk wth a cane I didnt like it.  I already have obsticles let alone peanuts on the floor so I can slip and fall.  I gave them a 2nd try and the floors were spotless.  Now to the food, the burgers are good and they do offer alott of condiments but they are over priced, the fries were good but they are overpriced also.  The coke machine they have in there is great.  It is a limited machine that offers you about 12 different types and drink then it offers you flavorings, ever try a orange Coke, yummy.  Be prepared to spend just for 1 person a single cheese burger, small frie, small drink, and tax $12.50.  Not a cheap lunch"}
{"text":"Ok, so I get the hype. But I am not sure I am a believer. It was good, but best burger ever? Nah, I don't think so. For $17 for lunch for two that included two burgers, a shared fry and two waters...I don't think I would become a regular. 

The meat was more than enough and it was.messy. I had mine all the way minus pickles and tomato and mustard, and it was good. Better than many in fact. 

Our order got taken by another patron on accident so our wait time was longer thn expected but it was no biggie.

I might could stretch it to 3.5 stars, but for this visit, I am going to round down. Maybe I will try again another day."}
{"text":"I've been to 5 guys many times in califnornia where I live. I'm visiting a friend out here & he wanted to go here so we did. We ordered just fine but when the food came we didn't notice our order was wrong until we got all the way back home. We ordered Cajun fries& got regular fries instead...we both ordered burgers his was made how he wanted it mine not so much. I was enjoying my burger until half way through I realized I bit into a mushroom! Gross! I didn't order mushrooms on my burger for a reason. I do NOt like them. My meal was completely ruined after that. 5 guys should be so lucky I am not allergic to them that order mix up could have cost 5 guys slot of money if I was. Please remind your workers to be sensitive to the condiments customers pick, if they didn't pick it DO NOT PUT IT ON THE BURGER! No Cajun fries like I ordered & mushrooms on my burger I should have called back & demanded them make me a new order but I didn't ."}
{"text":"For burgers and fries, Five Guys is top notch.  The burgers are fresh, and the fries plentiful (they always dump extra in your takeout bag).  However, the wait is painful...and if you want anything other than burger and fries, you will be sent elsewhere.  The \"Veggie Sandwich\" is just a burger with no meat.  Message here is, if you're not here for some old skool greasy pile o' food...what are you doing here?"}
{"text":"I had been hearing so many great things about Five Guys from people where I work.  We finally tried it, and we were not disappointed, but it cost about 35 dollars for a family of four.  Everyone enjoyed the burgers a lot, but they are very messy to eat - I prefer something less messy like a Whataburger or In-N-Out (which are considerably cheaper as well).  I think next time I go I will try their grilled cheese sandwich.  Also, I keep reading rave reviews about the fries.  My all time favorite for fries is still McDonalds (but only when they are fresh and hot).  I thought Five Guys fries were too greasy and soggy - but still very good."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are just great.  Get it loaded up and it's fantastic.

What I didn't like is that it wasn't clean.  Dirty tables and stuff all over the floors.

I'll give it another try for the food, but hopefully it's cleaner."}
{"text":"I have to admit, although it was a little overpriced, I'd rather eat here then McDonalds! The burgers and the fries fill you up so well! The burger is very big and juicy so you don't feel like they ripped you off. The food is made to order right in front of you and you get to decide whatever toppings you'd like on your burger. The free peanuts are also a plus!
This location is very clean. The employees take good care of it in regards to cleanliness, and they're all very polite."}
{"text":"My husband and I went two days in the row, since we had business to attend in the area. 

Very pleasant experience overall. I had the little cheeseburger one day and the next the hot dog with all the trimmings. Good quality meat in the burger and the veggies in the bun were fresh and crisp. The wiener in the hot dog was a little salty for me, but I guess that's how they make them these days. I like the fact that they cut the wiener lengthwise in half and grill it to give it some flavour.  
Best for me: The french fries. They are so yummy, hand cut, perfectly fried not over-salted. They even tell you where the specific batch came from ( ours was from Vauxhall, Alberta golden wonder).  The amount they serve is a bit insane (in a good way). The first day we ordered the large to share and there were so many in the bag that we couldn't finish them and brought the doggy bag home. That  large portion is easily enough for 4 people. The second day we shared the small size and that was more than enough for us 

The staff is very friendly and professional. Bathroom tidy and clean. Decor very appropriate. The music selection is awesome, just the right loudness to make it fun but able to converse with your friends and family. Great selection of 70s classic rock, which I think is very cool. Some of the other restaurants I have been to lately play music far too loud and the kind of teen pop that makes me want to scream or get out and eat in the car.
Overall Five Guys Burgers and Fries is a recommendable place to eat."}
{"text":"Five Guys has one of my favorite fast food burgers in the Valley.  Their standard cheeseburger is 2/3 of a pound (HUGE!), very delicious, and well-priced.  This location, and probably others, has the high-tech soda fountain machine that lets you add flavors to your Coke like lime and vanilla - pretty cool.

The only problem with this particular Five Guys is its location on Mill Avenue.  Metered parking nearby is hard to come by so, when you go here, you also have to factor in the walk from your car and the cost of parking."}
{"text":"Do I even need to write a review?! If you haven't had Five Guys  and youre spending time eating any other kind of fast food burger, you're wasting your time and money. This shit is delicious."}
{"text":"My kids love this place. I do wish there was a kids' menu. I order them the small burger and three of them can split a medium order of fries. The cajun fries are delish. The Coke machines are always fun adding fruit flavors to normal, everyday sodas and teas. My children always draw pics of burgers and fries while we're here. They have bulletin boards for posting your art as well. Never been disappointed with our food choices. I took my kids a couple days ago. We each got a small burger a couple orders of fries and sodas. Our tab was $52. A bit expensive for a fast lunch. That is why I am rating it only 4 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious made to order damn great burgers! thank god there is a decent burger place out here. I first ate at this place in Washington, DC. I loved it! the fact that you can put so much in your burger w/o being charged extra is awesome. The fries are shoestring &  I usually order  it w/ the lawry's on the side & well done. they give you a ton of fries for a small. place is clean & I love the updated look of the coke machines. :)"}
{"text":"OVERRATED&OVERPRICED ! Kept hearing good things about their burgers from coworkers from the east coast so I had to give it a shot. 

burgers here are pricey and didn't really feel like spending that much, so I got the single patty burger combo meal. Got my burger with everything on it from jalape√±os to shrooms and a order of their Cajun fries.  

Overall the burger didn't look amazing as I unwrapped the foil but it tasted fresh and the single serving of fries is enough to feed 2 people

Bottom line i would of gave it one star if it wasn't for all the free toppings you can add, but I'd rather go to InNOut and get a double double meal and spend less money for something just as fresh ! minus the mushrooms and jalape√±os or just go to smashburger for about the same price !"}
{"text":"The best chain burger you can get in the city.
I first ate at this chain a few years ago on a road trip to Florida and as I was sitting in the car eating my cheeseburger wrapped in tinfoil (commenting that maybe we shouldn't have each ordered a fries because they're HUGE) I complained that we needed this in Toronto. Well now we do! Haha, and unfortunately for my waistline it's uncomfortably close to my house, and just as good as it was in the states. Not much was lost in the cross-border translation. From the bright red and white self-congratulatory decor, to the awesome food and the giant bins of peanuts that fill the room and sate your appetite as you wait for your food: everything has come North. 
The burgers are big (the standard burger is two patties) juicy and fresh. I like to keep the toppings simple (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, pickles), but there's pretty much anything you could want to put on them on the menu. The sesame seed bun does the job holding the messy burgers together and the processed cheese makes the burger creamy and adds just the right amount of flavour without taking away from the burger.
The fries are on par with the burger and as good as some chip truck fries:  big, fresh and crispy. And, as mentioned above, unless your incredibly hungry a regular fries can serve 2 easily and a large more. They actually measure out a heaping portion of fries and dump them in the bag loose to match the portion they give you in the container.
It's not cheap, you're looking at 25 dollars plus for two (share a fries and share a drink: there are free refills), but honestly it feels like you're easily getting your money's worth. No other burger chain comes close."}
{"text":"There was no ketchup in my burger. They probably forgot about it because the place was full at the time. Asked for it and got some ketchup on the top after realizing there was no taste to it, but still, it was not as tasty as having it inside the burger. The last half of the burger still was dry."}
{"text":"WOW - a good hearty meal. The quality of the meat seems quite good. Service is great. Food may not be very good for me but always nice as a treat once in a while."}
{"text":"This was the best part of my vacation almost lol it was the 4th of July holiday weekend and i was in surprise and my sister kept saying you just got to go to Five Guys and we did it was Great all the way from California and we will be back"}
{"text":"ZOMG such a delicious burger, and a hefty portion of fries. This NC location was my first 5 guys visit and somehow all other locations pale by comparison, even upon return. I was excited to see 5 guys showing up in my home state but they just aren't as good. The jalapenos seem fresher and spicier here for one. I can't explain it otherwise."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! No matter how busy it is, the staff is always fast and friendly. The quality of the food is great and the restaurant is always clean. My husband and I both had a double burger and share an order of Cajun fries. The regular size for the fries is enough to share with leftovers. Food is always hot and fresh. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My first ever trip to a Five Guys was on 11/26 at lunch hour. A single patty burger with everything (that's everything on the list in black ink) was $4.09 and $2.59 for a large drink cup. Total with tax came to $7.22 which I suppose includes all you can eat peanuts and refills of pop. 
It took about five minutes from order to delivery. It took a few seconds to figure out how the weird looking Coke dispensers worked but I finally mastered it.
The dining area was clean, people behind the counter were fast and easy to understand. All in all decent service. 
I think their prices are a bit on the high side but you get what you pay for. You could go to McDonalds and pay much less but you're not getting served actual food there but chemical equivalencies (sim food) instead, which is why their food won't rot. Five Guys is not like that. 
And compared to next door (Jimmy Johns) the service at 5G's is much much better. You can tell 5G's wants your return business, JJ doesn't. So I'll be back. Thanks for the nice sandwich! I could actually taste the beef and it was good.

Update: been back here many times. The service is always about the same, so are the burgers. I still believe this is the best fast food burger in the USA today."}
{"text":"Ok I am late to the party.  I did not need to know about this.  I have been craving a burger and fries.  Last Thursday, I had a Little Hamburger with grilled mushrooms and grilled onions and of course fries.  Oh when simple things are done well, you can not beat it.  I don't think any other restaurant beats their fries.  The hamburger was thick enough to taste the meat and I could choose the toppings I wanted.

It was a bit noisy in the restaurant for me with all the shouting of orders so we ate outside and had a nice spot in the shade.  

If you need your burger fix, this would be my vote!"}
{"text":"After waiting for all the Yankees to finish overwhelming a new place, I finally tried out Five Guys. There is no mention of a 'double' Pattie burger, but that's what a cheeseburger will get you. They may be handmade, but no taste and the bun is ridiculously small for that burger. I didn't order fries, but saw several greasy, greasy cups full of them. No wonder Americans are grossly overweight. If Obama thinks this place is great, I'm so glad I'm a Republican.....never again...In and Out is worse.  I cannot fathom what either of them are 'famous' for....on the plus side; the peanuts were tolerable at Five Guys."}
{"text":"The employees here are awesome, friendly and perky. The burgers were all prepared on a grill to order. I got a bacon dog. All beef \"kosher style\"...lol
This location was better food, better employees and better service than the location we tried earlier this week.
Nice and juicy"}
{"text":"For a chain-Very Good.
Fresh cut fries. I love they have a sign and telling where they sourced the potatoes. The build your own burgers were a value at $4.29. All the toppings seemed fresh and they were messy and tasty just as expected. The ladies were friendly and helped us through our first visit to a 5 Guys. 
I wish they served \"eat in orders\" on trays. And they missed the mark with the cheese. I pulled it off my burger. The shrooms, onion, pickles, lettuce and tomato were all good.
You'll only need one order of fries for your entire table. And they were prepared for a bun less burger order."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys! Their burgers are always fresh along with everything else. 

For first timers I must warn you that there are no combos, so everything is separate: burgers, fries, and drinks.

When I had came with my boyfriend there was no line and I orderd a little bacon cheeseburger because their regular hamburgers come with 2 beef patties and 1 is way more than enough for me! 

Although there weren't a lot of people there it did take a while for us to get our food. And 1 thing that I will admit that I don't like about Five Guys is that they wrap your burgers in foil, which tends the make the bread soggy and by the time you're finished enjoying your bombtastic burger it can be a sloppy mess and not really appealing to look at. Plus there is no free parking nearby.

Besides that Five Guys is a good burger place, it might not be the end all to all other burger places but it definitely has potential to be in anyone's top choices!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burger joints in the city. The service is very fast and everyone is extremely professional. The restaurant is clean and the atmosphere seems very chill haha. This is really one of those \"you get what you pay for\" places, the food is great/high quality + you get a lot for your money. I'd def recommend this place to anyone visiting the city for the first time."}
{"text":"Burgers are OK. Real messy. Way over priced. $17.00 for 2 small burgers a small fry and a small drink. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love love love!! Five guys hits the right stop after a night out or if you are in the mood for a juicy burger that is made and not frozen and reheated. The standard burger is two patties and than you add your toppings. I usually get the little burger which is one patty. You can get a medium fry and split with two people. The portions are huge!! The service is quick and great! I recommend five guys for a tasty meal when you are not on a diet. Best part they have complimentatry peanuts to munch on while you wait for your meal to be completed."}
{"text":"I was given a free burger on their trial date to get the new workers into the feel of running this new joint, but it wasn't anything special. I heard it was really good but meh. It was very loud and uncomfortable, it just echoed everywhere. Maybe if I go during a time where it wasn't busy I'll feel differently."}
{"text":"Burgers are ok, but way too expensive.  Cost over $30 for 2 burgers 2 fries and a drink.  Unfortunately it didnt taste much better than a burger from cookout or burger king.   Service was fine but probably last time i go here due to quality for the price"}
{"text":"I only gave this 3 stars because while I absolutely LOVE the food, the music is so loud you can hardly talk.  The food is the same as all the other Five Guys...very good, great add-ons, limited selection (but that must be why it's so good, they can concentrate on making what they serve excellent).  However, someone needs to tell management and staff that the music level needs to be turned down a few notches.  If I want to go to a disco or bar and have music throbbing then I will, but there is simply no excuse for the level here.
Sorry :("}
{"text":"Why have I not discovered this sooner?  Last weekend I had an unbelievable craving for a burger.  Five guys hit the spot.  Nothing fancy, just delicious burgerness.  I ordered a jr burger and it was massive enough for my appetite.  We also ordered a large fry to share and had way too much.  Next time I'll go with jr burger and small fry to share.  If you haven't been, go.  the only thing that can make this place better is serving milk shakes."}
{"text":"Burgers are great and are consistent every time we have been there. More fries per order then we should be eating but they are great. The staff is always friendly and being able to order online makes it very easy for a quick pickup. Not inexpensive but what good food is??"}
{"text":"Everyone says how great these burgers are so I was here in November for training and we all ended up here for lunch. I thought the burger was good. Was it he best ever? Nope 
They had vinegar for the fries which I liked. Again it wouldn't be a place I would seek out but I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I have to give them 5 stars. my burger was cooked just right and was juicy and just the way I ordered it.also my son enjoyed his burger and ate it all . We shared 1 order of fries and it was more than enough for the both of us . they treated us so good that they just got a customer for life .love this place 5 stars ."}
{"text":"Last weekend, my sister was gracious enough to take my twin boys for the evening so my husband and I could have a date night :) She took the boys and my niece to Five Guys Burger and Fries for dinner. When we picked up the boys up from my sister's, the only thing they could talk about Five Guys and how much they wanted to go back. My husband and I finally acquiesced to our son's request and it turns out he was right. The food is delicious and the staff is courteous.  I can definitely predict that we will be going back."}
{"text":"The crazy thing is that Five Guys is always great and consistent, no matter where I get it. It is currently 1:53AM on a Saturday night and this particular Five Guys is closed. Its very disappointing when it's advertised to close at 3AM"}
{"text":"Today went to Five Guys Burgers and Fries..Didn't even know it existed. Well..Let me tell you..it's great. It reminded me of maybe a burger joint that would be located in NY. The burgers were great and they even carry my favotite tea, which is, Gold Peak sweetened Green Tea!

The atmosphere was lively and the staff was very nice and quick. The location is great because if you happened to be shopping at Target..It's located in the same parking lot.

I say...Try a new burger joint and sit down and relax at Five Guys Burgers and Fries!"}
{"text":"This is the best place ever! They have big burgers which is good because they are 6 bucks. They have the best food known to all man kind. I have wanted to go to this place for months and I finally was able to try it today. You have got to try this place out."}
{"text":"The food is always on point here, best burger in Vegas. Plus, it is super clean and the staff are always great. Another great experience and a special thank you to John for cooking an excellent burger. See you again soon!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers! They were made the way my wife and I asked! We were at the Surprise location, the staff was extremely nice and helpful! I was hesitant to try this place based in other yelpers reviews, however, I have learned not to buy into what they say and judge for myself!"}
{"text":"Stopped by while I was downtown working. It was busy, lunch hour and downtown = busy, so to be expected.

They actually messed up my order. Instead of a double bacon cheese burger they just gave me a cheese burger. 
I only realized it once I was sitting outside. I just took that as a sign I shouldn't really be eating this unhealthy stuff so I just ate it, as well as the couple dollars."}
{"text":"This is my in n out burger joint. This place is sooooo good. The burgers are juicy and tasty, and the Cajun fries are delicious! My favorite. I wish they had a better serving style for eat in the restaurant rather then eating out the bag. If you haven't tried this place I recommend you do. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I fell for the hype.

Novelties like free peanuts and the new automated touch screen soda fountains, does not guarantee good food.

First the french fries.  They are not shoe string fries and shouldn't be advertised as such.  You expect a crispy fry because of the lack of thickness... these are only a smidge smaller than steak fries and with that, more soggy and less crispy.  You do get a boat load of them though.

Secondly, this is not fast food.  You sit and wait just like at a Fuddruckers.  Not having a wait staff to bring you your food does not make a fast food joint.  It's slower than IN and OUT, but faster than a Red Robin.

There seems to be a trend in them advertising things that they are not.  Maybe I'm spending to much time watching the food network, but if you are going to say something is a certain thing, it should be, yes?

I've got to agree with some of the other disappointed customers, the burgers are flat taste wise.  Having an extensive \"condiment\" list can't compensate for that.  The toppings pale in comparison to the quality you'd get on a double-double elsewhere.  I'm also pretty sure the grilled mushrooms are canned (try getting a grilled flavor out of something that is waterlogged)

Lastly 13 bucks for a bacon double, fries and a soft drink is not worth it.

Maybe being in Phoenix and having IN and OUT's for fresh burgers and Fatburger's for the expanded line of condiments (who doesn't love a fried egg on their cheese burger) just kinda spoiled me in that I can't see coming back.  Because 5 guys is kind of an expensive combination of the two, but does nothing better than them.

But hey, if free peanuts is your thing, have at it."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food!!!Brett and his staff are awesome! Thanks for providing a great first time experience."}
{"text":"Ok I am vegetarian, so for me, this restaurant is a complete waste of time. The fries are OK. I've had similar many times over. Nothing special there. There are no onion rings. There are no veggie burgers. I ordered a tomato sandwich and it came on the same crappy sesame bun as a hamburger. I asked for a side pickle and got some bizarre chopped up pickle pieces. This is NOT the diner it is masquerading as, it's like eating at COSTCO, except that the prices are stupidly high, $50 for 2 burgers and one \"tomato bun\" with some fries and drinks. It's a big barn of a space and the automatic doors are constantly opening. I guess I just don't get it."}
{"text":"I should give this place ONE star for the kid behind the counter who kept calling me ma'am. Really, do I look like a ma'am? 

5 Guys is my go to place when I am in need of a tasty, juicy, doing a happy dance in my mouth cheeseburger. I always forget their original cheeseburgers are really two burgers in one. For a brief moment after I open the tinfoil I curse myself for not ordering the \"small\" burger but quickly get over my guilt and devour the whole burger. Poor thing never had a chance. The burgers are always flavorful, juicy and FRESH! I only have one no two complaints about the burgers. One, I wish they offered Whole Wheat Buns. The buns they have are fine except they get soggy quickly. Two, if I can't get a whole wheat bun, then I would like the option of having my bun toasted. Come to think of it, Ihave  never asked to have my bun toasted. Next time I'm there I will ask and therefore remove my second complaint. For now, my complaints stand as is.

The fries are good. Be prepared you get A LOT!!!! The best part, they offer Malt Vinegar for the Fries, the only way to eat Fries IMO. 

The place is always clean and the staff is always friendly. The free peanuts don't hurt either. All in all a great fast food joint."}
{"text":"A lot better than In and Out burgers if you ask me. Gets a little expensive when your ordering for the whole family and adding drinks and fries to that, but totally worth it. Fresh lettuce and tomatoes, quality ingredients is what you're paying for. Plus I love all the different options when choosing your fountain drink."}
{"text":"S-L-O-W, inaccurate and indifferent customer service. 

Waited 17 minutes on my order. They apparently got grease on the paper order ticket so they could not call out the order number, so instead they just called out what was on the order (which was incorrect). When no one picked the order up the manager flung the bag. 

In the meantime, I was standing at the pick-up counter obviously waiting on an order. No inquiry as to what I was waiting on or 'what's your order number'. The manager simply ignored me and went to the back to make more fries. 

At that point my 6 year old twins were getting restless, so I went to the register and asked for a refund. The same manager came over and asked what the issue was. I told her that I could not wait any longer for my food and needed to go. 

She got a bit huffy and said that she had called out what was on the order. I told her that the what she called out did not match what I ordered so why would I have assumed it was mine? I finally got a refund but no apology.

I have always had great experiences at the previous 5 Guys I have visited in CLT (SouthEnd and Arboretum). Clearly a rookie staff and manager at SouthPark Mall. Very uncharacteristic behavior for this business."}
{"text":"Good music, nice ambience and usually pretty clean,  noticed employees coughing over food while I was here today but usually they are top quality service. The food here is excellent, I always enjoy their burgers and Cajun fries but a tad bit on the expensive side for burgers"}
{"text":"Went there last night after my brother kept saying they had the best burgers around. 

Ordered the regular bacon cheese burger, fries and a drink. Burger was cooked just right, but I wasn't a fan of the cheese they used, don't remember getting a choice. Fries were OK and you get a bunch if them, so order less than you think you might want. 

Not a fan of the pick your own coke machine, too many choices and you end up standing in line waiting for people to push all the different buttons. Plus it's a Coke machine, but NO cherry coke option.

Decor is spartan and utilitairian, wood stools and tables with a tile floor, there are some metal tables and chairs outside. Music was way too loud and we left as soon as we finsihed eating because of the noise. Maybe that's why it's so loud, to turn the tables quicker.

It was OK, but I'd rather do Samshburger. Better fries, service, intertior and soda machine."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. I did an online order, and my fault, I accidentally hit for my burger to be made protein style - no bun. So as I continued my online order, I added that I would like lettuce on my burger. When I arrived at the store, they hadn't even started my order yet. That's fine, I'm okay with waiting, I'm not pushy. However, while waiting, the woman making my order yells my name. So, I approached her and she starts heckling me about my order, hands in the air, condescending tone, like she was purposely trying to make me feel dumb that I ordered my burger wrapped in lettuce with more lettuce on it. I apologized and said it was a mistake and that I would take my burger lettuce wrapped since she already started it and that she did not need to put anymore lettuce on it. Simple mistake, my bad. I went back to where I was sitting and I could still here her going on about my order. She was basically yelling about it to the other people working there and loud enough for the other guests to hear. She started to call my order \"the order for the rabbit\". It was so loud, that all the people working there were looking at me as well as the other guests. This continued for the next 15 minutes while I waited for my order. Finally my order was ready and I was embarrassed and completing shock that a guest would be treated in such a way. So, I picked up my food and right as I was about to walk out the door, this woman yells \"go on and eat your lettuce Taylor!\"  I couldn't believe it. This treatment is horrific and I hope no one else will ever have to endure such behavior when you are a paying guest. Bottom line, I will NEVER set foot in a five guys AGAIN."}
{"text":"Tatum and shea location. I've been going to other locations for years but unfortunately this particular location is consistently slow in their service. Burgers are very good. Management needs to step up their game."}
{"text":"have been to this store multiple times!  and even though it's $11 for a double burger, fries and a drink, it's freakin worth it.  5 GUYS smashes on In-n-Out.  In-n-Out is good, don't get me wrong, but 5 GUYS is on another level.  Love their fries, love their burgers, love this place!"}
{"text":"Whatever way you cut it, Five Guys is not a cheap eat. 
You are looking around 9 quid for a burger. But you get to add as many toppings as you want. They also serve beer, which puts it a cut above some of the alternatives.

So, after a few beers I find myself with an order of a 'dog' and a burger, with a beer, for ¬£17.75

Was it worth it? Yes. This is as close as it gets to proper American burgers you'll find in the UK. I would definitely say go for a burger over the dog though.

My topping recommendations are ketchup, mustard, grilled onion's and hot sauce.

It's quick as well, no fuss fast food style. Plus the open kitchen means you can watch your food being made as you wait."}
{"text":"I know people rave about this place, but its just hamburgers.  Good hamburgers?  Why yes.  Better than McDonalds?  Definitely!  But Red Robin has a much better selection of burgers with interesting ingredients.  But 5 Guys is just a standard burger with not much else to say about it."}
{"text":"A lot of food for a good price.  Fresh made while you wait.  The staff was friendly and the place was clean.  They were fast and efficient.  I also like the complimentary peanuts while you wait."}
{"text":"Good burger and friendly staff, but too loud for my tastes.  I actually appreciated that I did not order fries, but the girl working at the counter insist I have a few to give them a try.  (I'm not a French Fry eater, so I guess they were good?)  

I had no complaints and would certainly try other menu items in the future, but I don't know that I would make a special trip across town for it.  All told the food is good and the place is loud."}
{"text":"Five Guys is a gift from the gods!!! This is how I know the gods have not abandoned the human race. Nothing human could create such a masterpiece of cheese burger perfection. We should all be grateful and praise the gods daily that Five Guys exists and that we have the opportunity to experience daily a tiny bit of what heaven must feel like. The gods have spoken!"}
{"text":"Very good burgers, monster bag of fries. Free peanuts and establishment was very clean. Staff friendly. Indoor and outdoor seating. My single complaint...why only one trash bin for the whole place? Please add one outside and by the exit. Definite revisit here!"}
{"text":"This place has controversially and quietly been on the rise amongst burger joints. The only way for me to confirm with its credibility was to give it a try and so I did.

I got the mini cheeseburger with green peppers, jalapeno, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, and etc. Just because this burger is named mini does not mean the burger itself is mini. The difference between the mini burgers and the normal menu-named burgers is the amount of patties. In the mini, there is one patty while for the normal \"burger\" there is two patties. What I like about this burger is that I get to specify what I want in it and it's a very vintage old school style of burger which I like. It's not manufactured with cheap preservatives like McDonald's or Burger King but the ingredients for 5guys is a lot more fresh. However, I wouldn't particularly claim anything special about this burger. They are tasty and good, but nothing that special.

The fries on the other hand were amazing. We ordered the smallest one and it was huge! It came in medium sized cup but the catch about this is that after they place the fries in the bag, they scoop up like 2 spoon-full of fries and just throw it in with the bag. The more the merrier, especially if you're like me who fantasizes about fries all the time. The fries not only come in large quantity but they are great in quality. You have the option to have either normal or cajun fries. I got the cajun, and you should too!

Overall, a great experience and it met the hyped expectations that everyone has raved about. But I would go as far as saying that Five Guys is a bit overrated. In short, no it's not better than In'n Out, but it is definitely worth trying, especially for a change here and then.

PS. They also give you free peanuts o.O"}
{"text":"After visiting this location and the one in Scottsdale near where I live, I have to say this chain is just OK. It's a tad overpriced, and the food is good, but it's too much for a place that doesn't even bring the food to your table. Fries, burger and a drink came to $11-something! Yikes. If I were craving a burger, I'd head to Red Robin instead of this place. My credit card was hacked the day after I went here too. Coincidence? Probably, but that left a bad taste in my mouth!"}
{"text":"Nearly 11 years ago or so, I was traveling through the midwest and there was a little hamburger joint in a run-down building that was near my hotel. Free peanuts and unlimited free toppings was unheard of back then and the burger and experience was memorable. A decade later, five guys just started popping up everywhere and it became famous, so I was back trying those burgers and fries again and hoping to recapture that grey day years ago in the midwest and have another great burger. I always like rooting for the little guy, but Five Guys is not little anymore, they have made it, so whether or not I root for them anymore doesn't matter a lick.
   I ordered a Little Hamburger and fries and the meat is still fresh and the fries still have that skin on (although way oily) and the peanuts are still available. Stores all have that corporate look and feel, but these burgers are better than other fast food chains. It's not legendary, but not overpriced either at about 4 bucks for a 1/4 pound burger. Still, the best part of Five Guys is throwing your peanut shells anywhere and everywhere. Yep, it's the small things in life that make me happy."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge meat eater but my first bite of that tasty, juicy, scrumptious burger triggered me to attack the rest cave man carnivore style.

The burger was super fresh and you can put any of the fixins you want at no extra charge. I also ordered the fries which are natural cut and salted to perfection. They give you a generous portion, plenty to share. I'd never tried fries with malt vinegar but my lunch mate insisted and oh boy was it delish! Wayyyy better than ketchup. 

The restaurant was well kept  and the staff was friendly. We sat outside because the weather was especially nice, but the seating wasn't so comfortable, so I'd probably opt for inside next time. 

I will definitely be back next time I'm craving a fix for my meat eating side."}
{"text":"I wrote a review on another location, so I won't start all over, but I do have to comment on this particular location.

The burger is amazing. Every time I eat here, it is literally the best burger I've ever had. The quality of the meat and ingredients is just sooo darn good. So much better than In N Out Burger, but the same concept.

This location is close to work, so we go here a few times a month. I love love love their easy online ordering and the fact that my order is correct every time. The staff is friendly every time I've picked it up and the wait is minimal with the pre-ordering.

I don't know what else to say, but I love this place and I will be back again and again and again...."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better. Go big on toppings and ask for an empty cup to get water for the best value. Get fries to share, but a hamburger (single, not double) should fill you up unless it is your first day breaking from vegetarianism. This place simply is the best burger chain around, and Phil Mickelson agrees."}
{"text":"Craving a burger and fries? Five Guys has what you need. A little more on the expensive side for a burger and fries, but it's pretty tasty. I could barely fit my burger in my mouth for my first bite. A little messy, but I like it! If you have a peanut allergy, don't eat here. They use peanut oil. Handcut fries are what I would expect. I sprinkled a little malt vinegar and they were yummy."}
{"text":"Besides Jack Asters, five guys is my other favourite place for a burger & fries combo .. Love how they overflow your fries.. One large fries is more than enough to fill 2 people.. Only thing I don't like is how sometimes it takes to long to get your food even when it's dead but the taste of the food makes up for it. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"So my first experience was on opening night for this location and it was alright.  It was pretty packed, and loud, so I think I didn't talk loud enough when I placed my order and I wound up missing the lettuce and tomato on my burger.  Their bacon comes extra crispy and didn't seem like anything special.  Overall the burger was pretty decent, however I thought it'd be much better the way I ordered it and sans bacon as I'm not a crispy bacon fan.  Also I ordered the regular fries, their smallest size, and it's still a huge amount.  They fill the cup that the fries come in, then upon putting that and the burger in the bag, they dump another scoop of fries on top of the whole thing which could potentially make your burger wrapper very greasy if you were getting it to go.

On my second visit, it was much slower and my order came exactly as I ordered it with all the condiments.  This time without bacon and the addition of lettuce and tomato, it was quite an enjoyable burger.  I ordered the regular Five Guys fries this time and while still being too much to eat, they were tasty.

All in all for a pretty big burger, fries and a drink, you're looking at 10 bucks.

A couple things to note here are the amount of things you can put on the burger.  It's quite a decent selection.  Also there are boxes of peanuts with trays at the end of the checkout line that they offer for free to snack on while you eat.  Finally, they have Mello Yellow on the fountain here which may be enough to sway your descision in and of itself.  The establishment itself is quite clean and well laid out."}
{"text":"I felt it was over priced for what I got.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with everything.  The meat patty was fine but the bacon was burned.  I was disappointed at what seemed to be can mushrooms.  The whole thing disintegrated before I was was half way through and I was left picking bits up off the table.  There are definitely better burgers for less money elsewhere on State street"}
{"text":"Get my order wrong and I call after I drive all the way home have to come back and I Dnt get fresh fries! I have to ask after I already asked over the phone to remake my order so I Dnt have to wait. It's already over priced and I have to waste gas coming back and wait for you to cook some fries! I'm sooooooooo annoyed! Such poor customer service like seriously. $16 for 2 baby burgers and a baby fry."}
{"text":"5 guys has the best burgers that taste so fresh!  Always friendly service and peanuts to munch on as well. If u haven't tried 5 guys ur missing out."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Five Guys in the area. The staff are courteous and generous in their toppings. I've been here numerous times and the service and burgers are consistently prepared well. The numerous customers who come and go must make it difficult to keep up with, but I always see someone come by to clean up the tables nearby. The business owner keeps this place well staffed and I always feel welcome."}
{"text":"Good burger but they don't do the best on getting orders correct.  There were 3 of us and only one person had their order correct."}
{"text":"Oh good, another burger joint. Because that's what we need in this city. This particular location is located pretty much across the street from where the old Lick's used to be - and I miss Lick's. Basically I'm saying I was not in the mood to be impressed when boyfriend took me to eat here.  Well they changed my mind, all right. Got a regular burger with cheese, and decided to get it \"with everything\" (which I normally don't do). I also got a side of fries. I'm not reviewing the pop, because that's silly. It's fountain pop.

Burger was amazing. Loved it. Was surprised by 2nd patty in there and the cheese sauce should have been way over the top, but it was terrific.  The fries are very good too, and they give you about a million of them.

The service at this location was good too. It takes a few minutes to get your order (it's not like McDonalds), but they were friendly, asking about our day and generally chitchatting. Nice folks.

Will go back.
Would recommend unless you're on a diet. Then: DON'T GO."}
{"text":"I think that this place truly does live up to expectations in terms of quality and quantity. For those who think this place is expensive, well it's not much more expensive than typical franchise burger joints like Harveys or Wendys, PLUS you get a wider range of toppings and complementary peanuts. Furthermore, the ingredients are pretty fresh, and they're 'little' burger is essentially a normal sized one, so I would say you definitely get what you pay for.  In terms of line up and service, the line to order was long but moved by quickly, and the cashier was very friendly and full of smiles. The wait for the food however is slightly longer, but that's why they have a nice lady offering free peanuts to help you pass the time. My bf did tell me that the girl shouting out order numbers was fairly intimidating though.

I got a little bacon cheeseburger, with everything on it. I was surprised that the toppings weren't spilling out of the burger, or sogging up the burger bun, which made me even more excited to eat it and it was very delicious and juicy! The burger also didn't make me thirsty, which I always find to be a good sign ingredient wise. I was disappointed w/ the bacon, since it didn't do much for the burger, so next time I'd probably just opt for a cheeseburger. For those who 'think' they can eat a lot, I just want to share that there was a tall and buff guy next to me who ordered the regular sized burger and said, \"I can't do this anymore,\"  and abandoned the remaining quarter of his burger. So, for men out there, do not feel ashamed ordering a little burger, especially if you're going to order fries which comes in a large portion.

Speaking of fries, I had to try the cajun fries, but that was actually very disappointing. It wasn't bad, but it didn't taste like anything special, and in fact the seasoning reminded me of the flavour powder that comes w/ Shin ramyun (instant noodle). Probably won't order this again, would rather leave room and take on the regular sized burger

Overall, I think this place is a pleasant experience, and I would recommend just getting the burger, and skipping out on the fries. More like a 3.5, but thought I`d be generous since ppl seem to be harsh on this place."}
{"text":"Heard all about Five Guys being the best burger place in Phoenix...  NOT! Was very disappointed! First the cost! Give me a break! Just ordered a burger fries and drink for over 12 bucks? Forget it! Not impressed! In fact, I was at Fat Burger near Metro Center last month and was blown away! That burger was DELICIOUS and the fries rocked, these were gross! Some over cooked others raw! nope, once was enough for me!"}
{"text":"Very Friendly Workers.  Love the french fries here.  Great soda machine--100's of flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"Awesome burger and great value.  The regular burger has two patties and and a small fry is enormous.  You aren't going home hungry or broke.  Five Guys is a carnivore's utopia.

Their seasoned fries have a Cajun style kick.  I wouldn't call this a gourmet burger like The Counter since the menu is very basic.  But it holds its own in terms of quality of beef with Big Daddy's and it's faster than any grill in town.  Plus their soda fountain selection includes Mr Pibb Xtra.  Hoo ra!"}
{"text":"This review is a review of the corporate stores such as this one. I love their food but there is one thing that always makes me second guess going to Five Guys and I am sure you know what it is. The music. I am a very patient person but every time I walk into these places I want to walk right out. Don't go here if you are on a date or plan to visit with anybody. You will not be able to hear them without everyone else hearing the conversation. Thank god this one restaurant does have outdoor seating and there is no music. What you'll feel like when you go to these restaurants is that you're having five guys screaming at you the whole meal. Please turn the music down so people can enjoy each other's company and  also enjoy the food. Aside from the very loud music of this restaurant is the fact that when you order the most basic of the meals at this restaurant you will feel like someone picked hour pocket. Don't get me wrong the food is fresh tasting but I can feed a small family with what I have spent eating here and that's just a combo. Five guys you could be so much more!"}

{"text":"I think the cajun fries are what bring me back here. The burgers are delicious too, but it's the cajun fries that seal the deal. This location has never been too busy when I've gone, so it never takes more than 5 minutes to get my order. Friendly staff, extremely clean restaurant and bathrooms. A great quick stop if you're craving a burger and fries in Uptown!"}
{"text":"On the recommendation of a friend, partner and I went to 5Guys. He had fries and a double Bacon cheeseburger while I had the single Burger. The food tasted like Burger King's!  When I saw the bill, I felt ripped off. The only thing that stood out was the big quantity of mediocre fries they give you. I can't understand the glowing reviews here. Two stars for the good service but zero for the mediocre burgers."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from such a big chain, but do they ever put together a mean burger! I had the double cheese burger (really it was a triple since they had an extra patty for some reason and just gave it to me!) with all the toppings except for tomato and mushrooms and it all came together into one giant greasy mass of goodness. I think the handmade patties are really what make the big difference here. The quality toppings also help of course, but there's just something about how the burgers are assembled that put them miles ahead of many of the other chains like Hero Burger.

The service is very friendly, and despite the fact that it's in a new plaza, it does a fairly good job of making you feel like you're in a classic hamburger shop, but not in that over-the-top way that Lick's used to go for.

It's also quite a large restaurant, so there's lots of seating available, which is probably a good thing considering it was quite busy, even after 9 PM. Once Birchmount is extended south to Enterprise, where the new cinemas are being built, I can see this place staying open much later."}
{"text":"If you want a burger with real meat and fresh mushrooms and actual, non-processed cheese, this is the place to get it.  A lot of people think their burgers are the best in town. (I prefer Swenson's, which is better, but I wouldn't kick this burger out of bed for eating crackers.)  

Problem is, burgers are all they have - well, okay, you can get a hot dog.  Or fries.  Or another burger.  So if you want anything else at all, you're kind of up the creek.  

Me?  I like variety.  You've had one Five Guys burger, you've swept the menu.  If you're the sort of person who likes eating the same thing a lot, then this is the place for you.  I'll show up once every couple of months when the craving for a burger strikes and Swenson's is too far away and Bearden's (the other best burger in town nominee) is closed, but otherwise I'll forget it exists. 

Oh, and if you're allergic to peanuts?  There are cases of half-shelled nuts in the room, filling the air with deadly NUT DANDER.  YOU WILL DIE IF YOU WALK IN HERE.  Fo' reals.  There's even a sign on the door warning you of your impending demise."}
{"text":"I come here about twice a month. Thought I would review it. Visited not long after they were open so it wasn't that busy. Place was clean, person who took my order greeted me and was pleasant. Food wait time wasn't long, and the food was good. They generally have plenty of staff and one thing I like about five guys is that they have one person continually clean the dining hall. Wendy's did this 30 years ago but stopped the practice."}
{"text":"The place is not very clean with bread crumbs and fries crumbs visible on almost a third of the floor surface.  The service was kind of slow too as it takes around ten minutes for them to serve up the basic hamburger   The complimentary peanuts were just too too salty.  The fries were pretty good though, but still a little on the salty side for me.  The burger had too much liquid dripping from thr foil wrap.  My hands were all wet when I tried to grab it.  The flavours I got to say was quite good with beefy flavours but should have a little more fat.  They should also have blinds as the sun was beaming too bright."}
{"text":"I've always loved 5 guys (even though I've had one bad experience at the Athens, Ga location), but my experience at the Flamingo location was so good and has been multiple times that I felt obligated to write a review.

The staff there was super friendly. One night, my girl and I were passing by 7 minutes before close when she told me that she had never had 5 Guys!  *breaks screeching*. We turn into the parking lot. I peek my head in. \"Sorry, I know you guys are about to close, but my girlfriend has never had 5Guys before. Can we still get a burger\". If I caught some bad vibes I may have just left, but the staff was super duper amazingly friendly.  They let us come in and eat there at the restaurant 5 minutes before close with GIANT smiles on their faces and lots of enthusiasm. 

They even gave us more fries than usual. I guess because we were the last patrons to order. 

The whole experience was so good that my girlfriend and I ate there again a few days later. Same service. And I ate there again today. Perfect. 

Oh yeah, it also helps that the burgers and fries are outstanding. I highly recommend, if you like spicy, getting a burger with grilled jalape√±os and hot sauce. SO DANG GOOD!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Five Guys tonight.

I got the little burger which in my mind would be a burger for a kid. . .LOL  So when I asked them and they said that the little burger was a 1/4 pound burger. . .I was like well then what is the regular burger?  Seriously half pound???  LOL  All good. . .my bf devoured his 1/2 pounder and loved it!  =)

All the fixings for your burger are FREE!!  Yes FREE!!  LOL

I got Jalapenos. . .OMG. . .they use FRESH jalapenos!!  Not the pickled stuff everywhere else.  Grilled Onions, grilled mushrooms, lettuce, tomatoes, pickels and hot sauce.  DELICIOUS!!  The Burger was juicy. . .the fixings rocked. . .bacon was crispy. . .it rocked!!  =)  

And the fries. . .UNLESS you are starving for a major carb fix. . .get the smallest size. . .I got the medium size and they throw in another LARGE handful in the bag.  So let's just say you get more then double the size that you ordered.  It was crazy!  But the fries were good. . .just not as crispy as I would like. . .hence the minus 1 star.  

Oh and I forgot to mention. . .they have free roasted peanuts while you wait.  Totally cute!

The ambiance was very clean and not loud at all.  The staff were totally friendly and totally knew their stuff to answer all my questions.  

Will I be going back?  Heck yeah!  I'll be back!  =) 

Great burger for a great price!!  =)"}
{"text":"Here is my story on Five guys. Fries bathed in a peanut oil bubble bath will always make me happy. It reminds me of sunshine and puppies and all things that are pure and good in life. Five guys uses peanut oil and I am all for that. 

I took the advice of a reviewer and got a little guy (with cheese and bacon) and It was more than plenty with the fries and drink.

Peanuts while you wait. I was a bit amused by the text on the side of the box warning not to remove from the shop (on account of peanut allergies) Legal posturing for liability purposes always gets me...but good form.

I like that all the toppings you want are included at no additional charge. LIke mushrooms and grilled onions and about a dozen other options. That in a way justifies the higher prices, because while yeah there is the lamo who just wants ketchup, most will take advatage of that shiz and pile it high...yeah, like I did.

The coke fountain was seriously out of Star Trek The Next Generation.  I watched it... don't judge--if you got the reference you did too. I'm pretty sure Picard got his Earl Grey out of the same stinkin machine. 

Touch Screen. I push Coke. A dozen new icons come up. Would I like, Cherry Coke, Lime Coke, Lemon Coke, Orange Coke, Vanilla Coke? Just Coke thanks, I add my citrus the old fashioned way...from a piece of citrus. 

Bag was greasy, so I know I am going to like it. Yeah I did.  Go. You will feel a bit guilty, so eat a salad for dinner and run an extra mile. But do it."}
{"text":"This joint gets some rave reviews, but I just don't share the same perspective.  I find the burgers to be greasy (as well as the fries).  The burgers are impressive in terms of size and toppings, but they're a complete mess to eat and make sure you have plenty of napkins.

The outdor seating is nice to watch, especially during the warmer months when the shopping center brings out live music and the kids can play on the grass."}
{"text":"Good burger however fries were more burnt than most other establishments. While dining in, get ready for the \"is everything ok? Do you need anything?\" Questions cuz every time they walk by, like every few minutes, they ask. Had to tell them \"yea, can I get a little privacy?\" for them to stop asking. Also, a lot of yelling to each other. Every time someone walks through the door they yell \"one at the door\" or if they're waiting for something to cook they will yell \"waitin for a patty\" or something like that. More noise than a Las Vegas strip nightclub."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Real genuine burgers. Not that fake sh*t from the typical burger places like mcds, jacks etc. you also get a lot of fries. Menu isn't big, no shakes. But over all a good place. Great staff too"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It was amazing the service was wonderful. Everyone was in a great mood. Made us feel so welcomed. I loved it!!! Good was on point"}
{"text":"I haven't been back to a Five Guys for quite some time. They're normally very busy, especially at 12:30 pm on a Saturday. But I was the only customer there. It did start filling up as I was eating my meal. 

The establishment is spotless and the staff are friendly. 

I ordered the cheeseburger with everything on it and an order of fries. My entire daily caloric intake in one meal!!

The burger itself is really good. Great seasoning and texture. The problem was the bun. Maybe it wasn't a fresh bun. The bun fell apart and I ended up
Eating the burger with a fork. Still tasty but not the same as a sandwich. 

Fries were ok. A little greasy. Not quite crisp enough. 

Just not a fulfilling enough experience at twice the price of similar restaurants to go there regularly."}
{"text":"Really only giving it a 4 because of how great the food was. 

Today was my first time going here and we ordered 2 burgers, a fry and a pop. 

First, I like how they name their burgers, the regular burgers are doubles and then the \"littles\" only have a single patty-- pretty innovative. Also, condiments are free so you can maximize your dollar by getting every topping you want on it! Super awesome!

So I loaded up my burger and when we got our order, but my burger was lacking. They didn't put all of the condiments on it, which would have been a complete bummer if I had gotten to-go. Luckily, we ate in so I was able to tell them. The customer service wasn't rude or stand-offish, they were just very \"blah\". The employees seemed very bored and uninterested, not quick to help. 

The feel of this restaurant is kind of cool except a few things:
-The music was too loud
-The soda pop machine was so \"advanced\" it was confusing to use and we had to ask someone for help (super awkward)
-It's almost as if they expect/force you to get to-go. They don't ask you if it's \"for here or to go\", they automatically package your stuff up. Therefore, eating in was a bit of a hassle. 

So basically, this place gets four stars because the food was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"THEY HAVE NO PEANUTS HERE. Some mumbo jumbo about allergies and a movie theatre down the hallway and that is the reason we can't enjoy their signature free peanuts. Without those peanuts, the place seems like any other burger joint except all your toppings are free. I do love the fries here, but the burgers just do not have any sexiness or make me want to return on a regular basis. The price of a little burger and little fries was close to 9 bucks, so you can almost go have a gourmet burger for a few bucks more. Probably a once a year place if necessary and not this peanutless location."}
{"text":"In the Zocallo shopping plaza. Well, in the tradition of In & Out, here we have another burger joint with pretty decent hamburgers, but with a very limited menu. Besides the fries, they have hot dogs and 3 sandwiches; veggie, cheese and veggie, and grilled cheese. So, if you want cole slaw, jalapeno poppers, onion rings, a salad, etc., with your burger, better look elsewhere. I tried the double bacon burger, $6.79, wasn't that big, decent tasting enough though. Cajun fries were just OK, nothing special. One plus is that you really can have it \"your way...\" Add any toppings for no additional charge- mayo, lettuce, mustard, ketchup, jalapenos, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and more. Overall, place is OK, but the limited menu was a bummer for me."}
{"text":"Five guys is great at what they do.  Simple fast cooked burgers.  And I love the hot dogs too.  The cajun seasoning is a little too spicy for me so I get plain fries and a small is plenty for two people.

This location has great staff cranking out hot food made to order."}
{"text":"This 5 Guys location recently went through renovations. It looks great, but the renovations went beyond the cosmetic kind. There are new menu items like shakes (the salted caramel with bacon...yes bacon...is amazing). The fries are being fixed differently and come out piping hot, crispy on the outside and beautifully tender inside, and the level of service has had a major overhaul!  

5 Guys burgers and dogs have always been good, but this location is seriously doing it right. If you haven't been here in a while, come back and experience the difference!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better Burger's you can get at a chain. I've had Five Guys Burger's in 3 different states and a half dozen different establishments. Burgers are made to order with unlimited toppings. The regular size burger and cheeseburger are both double patties, in most cases a single works fine for me. As good as the burgers are the fries. They pack them in and overflow into the bag, well seasoned."}
{"text":"Way over priced. The deal here is to fill you up on overloaded French Fry's. The bill for 2 burgers, 2 Frys, and 2 drinks was $28.00. Even eating in, they must treat it like take out because our order came in a brown bag. So we had no tray, basket, or plates. They put the burgers in the bottom of the bag and filled 6\" of French frys on top of it. Way more than any one person would want to eat. Each order of frys looked like the equivalent of 2 whole potatoes. The only good thing I could say was the burger by itself was very good. It was cooked just right. Juicy and flavorful. Still, the price can't be overlooked. $28.00 for 2 people is too much for a lunch of fast food"}
{"text":"Comparing with other \"Five Guys\" locations, this particular location, in the Blakeney Shopping Center, is one of the best.  This location tends to operate pretty fast and have no issues for unique orders (like well-done fries, I like them crispy).  There is two Coke Freestyle machines (so no waiting behind the kid choosing every flavor) and the boxes of peanuts are usually fresh.  When order is ready, one of the \"five guys\" will come to your table to hand the food as oppose to simply yelling out your number to pick-up.

Always ate there for lunch, which is surprisingly not as busy as one would expect.  However, if school is out, the place does attract a lot of families.  As for the food itself, well... it is a darn good burger, you cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars rounded up due to the yummy fries.

My co-workers have been eating 5 guys since this location opened and fantastic aromas filled the office every time. Today was finally my day. I must admit, I was a little disappointed.... maybe my  expectations were too high.

The burgers are oversized with a regular containing two patties. I prefer a single burger -  a double burger just has too much meat in my opinion. You get to pick toppings but nothing really out of the ordinary. Jalapenos were probably the most exotic topping.  I find the burgers taste very similar to Wendy's. Final conclusion, a simple average burger.

The fries are good though. Clearly home made as you have to pass a stack of potato bags on the way to the ordering counter. They come in different sizes but the regular is a good portion size. You can get spicy or regular. I had regular but tried my friends order of spicy fries - both were very good. The fries are a little greasy and staining my brown take-out bag with grease.

Including a diet coke (I had to cut some calories) my order was about $12 which is above average but as previously noted, portions are huge. Service was fast and efficient and there's a lot of seating available.  

Bonus - complimentary peanuts.  

I'm in no rush to return. My search continues for a \"specialized\" burger joint that compares with my fav. Harvey's burger (and at half the price).

BK"}
{"text":"Always a good burger - and amazing fries! A family fav for a quick meal. Super friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Really good and simple burger. Plenty of toppings that you add for free. 

At first glance the fries seem really expensive but they can feed 2-3 people with the normal size. These are good fries (take note in-n-out). You can tell that they take pride in them since they have a board that tells you where the potatoes came from and bags of potatoes everywhere.

Nice to have some peanuts while waiting as well.

There is a reason this chain is spreading fast.

It is a bit pricey though and no good option for kids burger. also kinda don't like how the squish the burger in the foil. but it does help the cheese melt."}
{"text":"The burger and fries were great. It's very clean. Polite employees. $13 for burger, fries & drink seems a little high, but I would still recommend it."}
{"text":"The burgers are consistently good. As other reviews have stated the portions are large. Double patty regular burger is filling. I like the multiple topping options.  The fries are meant to be shared even then it's a challenge given the size of the burgers. I would add the fries are always hot and crunchy as fries ought to be.

If you are a craving a burger and fries and want something you know is going to be fresh, cooked to order, and delicious. Go to five guys.

And the staff here are friendly and the service is fast."}
{"text":"I've been to Five Guys twice now, first on opening day when I got a small burger, fries and a drink for $10.  I thought the burger was very good.  I liked it better then In 'N Out just because of the toppings.  I like more of an exotic burger and Five Guys had plenty of toppings to choose from that made it just the way I like it.  The cajun fries were very good, but they give you way too many.  I'd rather see a smaller portion for less money.  

Yesterday I went again and this time ordered a Cheese Hot Dog.  The hot dog was very good, Kosher, cut down the middle and grilled.  The cheese was a slice of American cheese which was better then the liquid crap most places use, but better yet would have been grated cheese.  I also got grilled onions, mushrooms, and jalepenos on top, but didn't get many toppings, maybe because of the limited space on a hot dog, but a little disappointing.

Overall I think it's really good and I would have given it a high rating if it was a little cheaper and if they used grated cheese.  Everyone working there was very friendly and love the classic rock music they play."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was 90% of the tables has not been cleaned & peanut shells all over the floor? The burgers are good a bit on the greasy side. But the fries was too heavy on the salt, we ordered Poutine so add gravy & cheese it was unbelievably salty & we couldn't eat it. The positive side is they replaced it with no hassle. Last but most importantly was the washroom -2 stalls and one had a tampon floating in the toilet YUK!!! Obviously bathroom checks isn't done often enough. Overall we spent $25 for 2 burgers &  1 Poutine, would I go back? No I wouldn't because there are many other burger joints I can spend my money on without having to clean my own table, better tasting food & cleaner washrooms."}
{"text":"Good food but a major let down that they forgot to put the jalape√±os and grilled mushrooms on my burger. Without those toppings it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night. The cashier was pretty friendly. The style was build-your-own burger.

I ordered a Little Bacon Cheeseburger with mayo, lettuce, and pickles. My friend order a Little Bacon burger and we shared a regular cajun french fries.

On a scale of 1 to 10 on freshness of produce I'd say it was a 5. The veggies were a little sad.

On a scale of 1 to 10 on the meat quality I'd sad they were a 4. The meat didn't have much flavor and there was barely any bacon on my burger.

The fries had amazing flavor but were a little soggy. I went up to ask for ranch and the guy said, \"No,\" and gave me an annoyed and irritated look. That's cool!

This place is okay. If anything it just satisfied my hunger and that's it. Lol"}
{"text":"Good burger, 15 minute wait for 2 burgers and fries, and less fries than EVERY OTHER FIVE GUYS!  Before anyone tells me I'm wrong, read this FB post:
https://www.facebook.com/fiveguys/posts/10155637298444441?comment_id=10155697235339441&reply_comment_id=10155698180829441&notif_t=feed_comment_reply&notif_id=1506082626328631
Most importantly, this one comment: Steven Kaiser I used to be a manager at one. It was our policy to fill up the cup as much as possible with fries, no matter what size, set it in the bag next to the burger, then take a measured extra scoop (which is bigger for a bigger order of fries, just depends what you order) then throw that scoop on top of the cup of fries to give appearance of an abundance of fries. So if you're not getting any extra fries outside your cup, that definitely is not how that restaurant works, and I would reach out to your local five guys, and try to talk to that management so it gets corrected. I think the fries at the bottom of the bag are the best part!!
The fires in my order, and every order here, fill the cup. 
Avoid this location."}
{"text":"It's SOOOOO good.  Very fresh, very tasty.  I used to frequent the one in Alexandria, VA, and I was elated to find that they just opened one in Madison.  They don't charge for toppings, so load it up with jalapeos, mushrooms, pickles, whatever. And munch on some free peanuts while waiting."}
{"text":"5 guys does not disappoint! Sure the interior isn't pretty but it's the burger I dream of. Luckily, it's far away so I don't eat there often. When I do, I am always 100% satisfied with everything! May be the best burger I've ever had. I LOVE 5 Guys."}
{"text":"This review is mainly based off of the employee (possibly manager?) by the name of Shane. I have never seen anybody so happy at work (especially at a restaurant). Shane was so helpful and had a friendly demeanor, he was even singing along with his co-workers while he worked. He was working his butt off and making sure the flow of orders and food was flowing smoothly. His genuine concern about how he could make our experience even better was outstanding.. I really wish there was more people like him here!

Oh, the food was pretty good too, ha!"}
{"text":"I used to live about two blocks from here. When I first moved there I tried \"create\" burger and it was just about the worst thing I have ever tasted. I got an egg on my burger and that egg must have come from a Pterodactyl it was so old. I would often lay in bed at night thinking, \"If only a group of men would come and offer me a tasty burger\" and sure enough baby jesus answered my prayers and Five Guys came to the rescue. 

I used to live in DC so I was familiar with their work and went there immediately. Obviously five guys is a chain but oftentimes chains will have varying degrees of quality- the food is still made by humans(... for now) and so there can be huge differences in quality. This Five Guys is probably one of the better ones I have been to, I will give a few examples of what I mean

1. Online ordering- when I ordered online the first time it said \"your food will be ready in 8 minutes\" - usually a claim like that results in me getting to the place on time and then waiting 20 minutes for my food. Not so here- I got there in 7 minutes and by the time I had finished my drink my food was ready. The last thing they did as I was waiting for my bag was fill my cup of fries- and then dump an additional scoop of fries into the bag for no reason other than awesome. 

2. I am waiting in line for my food and I realize due to a miscommunication they have given me a burger with no cheese. I bring this up and they fixed it without charge - and in fact gave me extra cheese. 

3. 300 flavor coke machine.

The burgers are really good for fast food- as are the toppings. They all seem to be freshly prepared- lettuce is crispy, tomato not mushy, jalapeno crisp. I even like the buns."}
{"text":"Pluses:  Service, priced well for what they are attempting (attempting being the key word) clean, fun atmosphere.

Minuses: I had the burger with A1.  It was smothered in A1 overpowering.  Made the bun super soggy.  Burgers are well done,  no other option.  Only American cheese no other cheese choice.  Really?  Fries were unevenly cooked.  Some were still white others crispy-very inconsistent."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes, yes, yes.  Burgers aren't complicated; they require only subtle touches to be incredible.  Great quality meat, perfect coming temperature, fresh, wholesome additions, and of course a bun which isn't wholly sugar... Five guys gets every point right, and particularly at this location, I am constantly and consistently impressed with the care taken in delivering a product worthy of the high praise the chain already receives. 

Can't be beaten for value, for quality, for taste.  Excellent."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with their burgers, they were ok but nothing special! However, the service and atmosphere were good for families with children"}
{"text":"If it was possible to rate zero stars I would. Only good thing about this place is the cashier was very helpful when placing a big order for 8 people. As soon as we walked into the restaurant we were met with ice cold freezing temperature in the building. We were all cold before we even got to the register to order. The ac was on full blast belting out cold air, yet it was cold outside. 

As our food came it was instantly cold because of the temperature of the air in the building. Most of the tables that could for our crowd had the ac vent right above is making our experience even worse. Most of us were so cold we were shivering or bundled up as if we were ready to play in the snow. 

Our hamburgers were tasteless with zero seasonings on the patties. I had to eat multiple pickles and onions just to get any sense of flavor to finish the burger. This was my first time at Five Guys and I can say I'm highly disappointed. 

The staff was amusing in the beginning but they were beyond loud by the time we left. You could hear them and they were being highly inappropriate for it being a public establishment with child present. The manager was also very active in the inappropriate content of their conversation. By the end of our meal we heard what sounded like a dog barking and screeching in their vicinity. Myself and everyone in my party looked at each other to actually try to figure out if they had a dog behind the counter. That's how real it sounded. Nope it was an employee acting db making noises. It was not a joyful relaxed experience at all. 

I even walked into the bathroom to try to defrost my fingers after eating, by placing them in hot water. Needless to say I was disappointed when all they had was cold water to wash my hands. It was nicer outside than it was in the building. It should have been the opposite feeling. After reading reviews it seems the temperature inside has been an issue before. 

All I know is I will never be back to Five Guys again, even if it's that's last burger joint standing."}
{"text":"Definitely not as good as advertised. This would not be my first choice if i wanted a good burger. It was not worth the high price and as i stated the taste wasn't even all that great. The fries tasted weird. The service was OK but i won't be back EVER!!!!!!"}
{"text":"These burgers are some of the biggest, baddest motha &$!@ers you've ever had. The decor is no nonsense, the open kitchen let's you see the the action as you munch on peanuts. A great place to pack in a few burgers with the boys. That said, it might not be the best choice for a date, unless she's into pink floyd and doesn't mind the spartan decor.

All that to say, this is one of the best burgers in the Montreal area. Serious burgers that will mess you up if you don't check yourself. Respect the game."}
{"text":"My husband and I are BIG FANS of Five Guys! However, this means we are always looking for the best Five Guys, wherever we may live. Luckily, the one a couple blocks away has a fantastic manager and team. 

The music is always good, the place has never been dirty when we visit, the manager is so friendly (it is nice to be remembered as a 'regular), and the orders are triple checked for accuracy. 

All in all, I have nothing bad to say about this location and give props to the manager (Mark) for his leadership ability! Mark is an outstanding manager and we appreciate his efforts every time."}
{"text":"The place was packed with people probably because they are still new; however the line moved pretty quickly.  I was surprised to find out a regular burger was a double patty..Awesome.  I liked the environment.  I thought the place was a fun atmosphere and I like the idea of eating peanuts while I wait.  I was overloaded with way to many fries (not a bad thing).  I also like the FREE toppings.  I could get anything I want on it, and it doesn't cost me anything new.  I do think the prices are little high once you get a burger, fries and a drink you end up paying around $10-$12.  Overall pretty happy with the place."}
{"text":"Simple order screwed up.  No bacon on a Bacon Cheeseburger.  I don't go to Five Guys often because it's a bit expensive for a burger although normally pretty good.  This visit however was not good.  Bacon is an essential piece to this puzzle, how could they forget it?"}
{"text":"Personally, I think of Five Guys as overpriced fast food. Being a health freak, I get really queasy at the sight of the dripping grease, but I was willing to accept that fact because it is a \"burgers and fries\" place. 

I thought their burgers were just okay, nothing to brag about. Fries were fresh, but just fries. I did enjoy the free peanuts though. I'm not a burgers and fries gal, so probably won't return here unless I really have that craving for their cajun fries. Yes, try their cajun fries...best thing there."}
{"text":"Meh.... Not sure what all the fuss is about.. If you want  a lot of fries go for it.. Burger wasn't that special.. My bread was soggy too.."}
{"text":"Good location and clean fast food place. Better than others I have been to."}
{"text":"5 Guys is a notch better than In & Out.  The only thing that worries me is the price of Five Guys.  Thats going to turn a lot of people off.  They need to keep it under $10 for one person ordering a burger, fries and drink.  Great place though."}
{"text":"This was a quick dinner option after watching a movie nearby. I wanted something filling as had an appetite. Ordering was quick as few options for burgers (one can go crazy with the condiments I suppose) I also added small fries as they came recommended. The kitchen is open and they grill/fry to order. 
Now full disclaimer I am not a big fan of burgers but can tell if I have a decent one. 
The wait was ok and grabbing a spot wasn't hard as well. The seating is greasy as expected. First of the burger is decent sized. The taste was ok. Not quite gourmet nor is it the fast food variety. I think of in and out burgers as benchmark for this level and sadly this isn't up to par. 2 stars for the burger as way to greasy for my taste. Fries fared better as nice and warm. Half star added for those. 2.5 stars all said and done."}
{"text":"Super friendly and fast staff who seem to love working there. I was shocked by how much food I got,  after I was shocked by the price; totally my fault though. This was my first visit to a Five Guys Location, and upon seeing that it looked like a fast food joint, I didn't expect the high prices. Even when ordering I didn't realize the burger is a double patty, and the little burger is a single. I got a burger, fries and drink for about $16, but when I got that hefty bag of food, I completely understood why it cost as much as it does.  You really do get your money's worth, plus free peanuts while you wait for your order.  

The burgers are fresh, the fries (both Cajun and regular) are SOOOOO good, and there are a variety of condiments. I felt terrible about not finishing, but it was A LOT of food. They put your burger in the brown paper bag, with your cup of fries....then fill the bag with a ton more fries to bury to rest of your food. 

My advice:  go hungry and not alone (:D)
You'll need somebody to split those fries with!


Overall, it's a great place."}
{"text":"Not to bad but way to much money for a burger. 1 cheeseburger is 7$. Just so you know it's like 7$ for a burger 4 for frys and drink 2. It does add up."}
{"text":"Great burger reminded me of my mom's homemade burger :) the fries taste so good as well. This burger became on my favorite food list for sure!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times over the past year....the burgers are consistently delicious and the staff does a good job of keeping the restaurant clean.  The service is always quick and friendly.  The cost is a few bucks higher than the chain places close by but you get what you pay for.  In my opinion the best place to go if you're not in the mood to fire up the grill."}
{"text":"Normally go to the 5 G's in Steele Creek but was in Rock Hill this past weekend.....had everything I like about that one (thick, juicy burgers, quick, friendly service and clean) but with the added benefit of not one, but TWO of the new Coke touchscreen drink machines!....very nice, will be back...love the cherry coke!"}
{"text":"I'm never one to order a burger at a restaurant. And I'll never order one at a Mcdonalds. I need a place in between. Five guys is one of those places. I've always loved the taste. It's so juicy and flavorful. This location is never busy when i go which i like. It does take a little while for it to come out but I'm ok with that because i know that they're cooking to order and you can see it for yourself. They have a bunch of toppings which are free, as it should be. They also have free refills on soda. Their fries aren't anything life changing. If you do get fries, ask them to mix the hot sauce with mayo as it makes it taste way better. My one issue is that it is a tad bit over priced but it's not something you're having everyday, at least for me. I always get the little cheeseburger which isn't little but not filling enough either. The ambiance has a cool diner feel to it. i think the one thing missing from their menu are milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Went there on opening day today for lunch as well.  I concur that it was slam-diggity but super well-staffed.  I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly we got in & out on opening day AND it was also the 1st day of the Tempe Festival of the (F)Arts, so it was extra crowded on Mill Ave today.

I have to say I'm stoked there's a new lunch option within 2 minutes walk of my office.  Since the dirty Uno's closed on Halloween my walkable lunch options have been reduced to LaBoca (which I prefer/reserve for drinking  1/2 half off drinks), P. F Chang's & Chili's.....with an occasional jaunt to Z-Tejas or the Tavern on Mill (time permitting, natch).  

One of my co-workers is from D.C. and has been wet over 5 guys opening for weeks.  Today we finally got to imbibe & partake of all that is 5 Guys.  The food was excellent. The service was fast & efficient for the crowds they served (so glad they were cognizant & well-prepared for things today -- a true surprise for Mill Ave restaurateurs who typically seem clueless to the community in which the run a business), and frankly I loved the food.  Basic, simple, no BS and plentiful portions.  

I got a cheeseburger with ketchup, mayo, lettuce & tomato & was pleasantly surprised to find it was a delicious double pattty upon my return to work with my heavy sack o'goodness.  The fries are flat out phenomenal & today's beauties came from \"ground apples\" straight outta Shelly, Idaho.  I appreciate the localization of the carb offerings.  They're skin-on, hand-cut beautes fried in peanut oil (as all things there are cooked, apparently), and the fountain cherry Coke capped off my mid-day repas with classic American stylee & finesse.

I went large with lunch (XL coke & XL fries) and my tab was in the $13 dollar range....which is not odd for Mill Ave & I didnt hafta tip, so awesome.  A co-worker went tiny-sized and got a single burger, small fries & a soda for under $10.  I'd definitely return again, but most likely when I'm having a stressful day, require a greazy lunch and should probably take a good walk after lunch.  I will return for fries and want to try the cheese fries and the hot dog selection.

Everyone was super friendly and I applaud the franchisees for doing a bang-up job on staff training, preparedness and efficiency."}
{"text":"Five guys burgers and fries... Where to start this place is fantastic with delicious burgers and fresh cut fires... The burgers are available any way you want them with about 12 different items for making it your own.  The regular burger is 2 patties which makes for a pretty substantial burger and little burger is one party and is about all I can handle.  The fries which are made for fresh cut Idaho potatoes are quite tasty and plentiful again a small is a cup of fries with about another cup of fries that are loose in the bag, again a small is more then enough for 1 or even 2 people.  And are available with Cajun seasoning if you wanna spice It up.

The restaurant It's self is a well lite fun place they offer peanuts by the giant box full to snack on while you wait.   For beverages the have the new future coke machine that can add selected favors to your favorite coke products...
Bottom line.  If you love burger you will love five guys and come back many time jut as I have!!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"My coworker and I were eagerly waiting for this place to open.. Finally, made our way here, a change from our usual 'go-to' burger spot at Gorden Biersch. 

First thing I noticed were sacks of potatoes, complimentary peanuts and some bright pink red patties cookin' behind the counter.. 

Double Cheeseburger: Got it with mayo, lettuce and tomato. Not the most architecturally constructed burger but not nearly as sloppy as a Tommy's Burgers either. This thing hit the right notes for me! In regards to the the patty itself, it was Absolutely packed with that great burger taste! I liked it better than Smashburger (smashburger's slightly over salted for my taste) and I'd probably take this over In-N-Out, 7/10 times (don't get me wrong, in n out is awesome).. I did notice the bottom bun starting to sponge in some of the juices from the patty but it didn't bother me much.

French Fries: Large was more than enough for 2. Their fries were fried more over done than the usual and with skin-on. I liked them, and the thought of them utilizing fresh potatoes may have mentally helped..

Service typical. Ambiance was cool and interesting with all the peanuts shells scattered on the floor surrounded by potato sacks. Value was fair for quantity But I thinkt the quality of the Burger makes up for it!"}
{"text":"The closest thing you can get to a fast-food burger anywhere near State Street. Five Guys is just pure, unadulterated grease - look at your burger next time you stop by here and just take a minute to contemplate why you are putting this into your body. There is literally some kind of industrial extra-fat mayo in there.

If you're like any red-blooded American and can let this thought pass in an insignificant whim, then you're in luck. Five Guys makes a damn good burger; The patties are thinner, but are extremely juicy. Unfortunately that means that in order to get just as full, you buy more food and end up paying just as much as you would for a bigger burger elsewhere. Not that that matters - this big chain restaurant is just about stomping on half of the bars in town."}
{"text":"Meat was under seasoned (possibly not even seasoned).  Toppings were plentiful and free.  Fries are good too.  Regular hamburger has two patties so it's definitely filling.  The free peanuts are in a box at the back.
Not as greasy as the priest or chuck, but good quality for smack in the middle of downtown t.o."}
{"text":"I can't say enough positive stuff about this location of Five Guys. The last time I was in, there was a small error in my order that I didn't notice until I got home. It had actually occurred once before, and so I did call just to let them know. They said the would have a $5 gift card waiting for me, which was more than the cost of the error so I was happy with that. When I came in today, they kindly got my gift card from the office. I ordered, and when I was ready to use the gift card the cashier said, \"Oh no, keep that. You don't have to pay today.\" It was totally unexpected and really over the top. 

The food is always great, and the service is wonderful and friendly!  We will be back without hesitation!"}
{"text":"customer service is great ! And the burgers are phenomenal . Best place in town if you're looking for a good burger joint :)"}
{"text":"I'm gonna say it right now, I prefer this place over In-and-Out.

I'll get the one negative out of the way, I wish they did curly fries but they instead aim to provide fresh cut French fries (which I also hoped were thinner). I also wish I got to try their Cajun fries but was outvoted.

Their burger menu, although small, has the essentials. You can get plain, cheese, bacon, a combination of the above or even a veggie burger (which is full of veggies and not a fake meat patty). You can also choose to FREELY add fillers to your burger with standard stuff like lettuce, tomatoes, to more unique things like hot sauce and mushrooms.

They have a wide range of portion sizes to choose from and even the smallest sizes make a good meal if you're on the go and don't want to be weighed down by your stomach.

They also have a huge bag of free (dry roasted?) peanuts for patrons to snack on while they wait for their meals.

Service, especially for a fast food joint, was excellent. Everyone was friendly and hustled for the customer and that includes the table cleaning staff.

4 stars, thoroughly impressed by food and restaurant overall. Most likely would give the full five stars if they had curly fries or if I got to try their Cajun fries."}
{"text":"Let me say first that I absolutely adore a good cheeseburger and fries.  Sadly, I do try to resist them because they're not the best for you but, sometimes it's impossible to avoid this temptation.
So, I had a major moment of weakness and found myself starving after a trip to Target-Five Guys!  All their accolades and awards made me very hopeful that I'd soon enjoy a pipin' hot, crispy, salty bag of french fry heaven and a juicy flavorful cheeseburger.
Unfortunately, they dissappointed big time on both factors.  The fries were room temperature at best and, frankly, mushy.  I did not find one fry in the bag that offered any resistance to the tooth.  I ended up throwing away basically all of them.  The burger was okay I guess, not very juicy and really-would it kill you to put on at least salt and pepper??  
I can't see this place lasting long especially with places like Delux around, hell even Wendy's has better burgers IMHO."}
{"text":"I ordered through ubereats. It was wrong. They made a cheeseburger instead of a bacon cheeseburger, so not only do I not have bacon but a paid extra on my bill. Even worse the fries were very soft and under fried and peppered with a ridiculous amount of the Cajun seasoning. I wouldn't mind too much seasoning but being in too much of a rush to keep the fries in the fryer for an extra 2 minutes is unforgivable. You know you are charging $4-5 a la carte for the fries right? You are aware that McDonald's fries, which are only $1, are crispy 100% of the time? I will never go back. I will just get McDonald's for 1/3rd the price. Sure your food tastes much better but at least at McDonald's they know how to prepare it properly. I would have called to complain but what are you going to do redeliver me fries for free tonight? Cuz a coupon isn't going to fix my meal tonight. Ok I have to go throw the fries in the garbage now even though I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"The Five Guys in Goodyear is close to where I work, but it's taken me a while to try it. The only one I've been to is in the airport in D.C. and it's okay, but everything is very rushed because, well, it's an airport.

This was nicer, in that I could sit down and relax at a table. 

Pros - 
- clean restaurant
- they have those new self-service, multi-soda machines that give you many options. I like the Raspberry Coke Zero.
- free drink refills at aforementioned self-service machine.
- nice sized burger (I had the regular, which is a double - NOTE that the \"little\" burger is a single, and the regular is a double. I think a lot of people assume the \"little\" burgers are kid-sized, not the case.
- fries are plentiful. They serve them in a cup, then put the cup and burger in a bag, and the fries more than overflowed the cup. I'd say there were twice as many french fries as would have fit in the cup.
- options - this place truly serves the burger \"your way,\" when you order you can select options like grilled onions, grilled onions, lettuce, pickle, ketchup, mustard, bbq sauce, etc. 
- Friendly staff. There was no on in line when I got there, and a guy behind the counter saw me looking at the menu; asked me if I'd been there before, when I said no he asked if I knew how it worked, again no, and he explained the menu. He was very clear about the \"little\" burger vs regular.

Cons - 
- Very pricey for a burger joint. For a regular burger, small fries and small drink, $14.55. (remember, \"regular\" burger means a double patty)
- Chairs are uncomfortable, in my opinion.
- No mayo to be seen anywhere - I like mayo mixed with ketchup for dippin' my fries. 
- Fries were good, but inconsistent - I had undercooked, nearly burned and just right fries all in the same pile.

All in all, while I enjoyed my meal, I could go to Red Robin for a \"gourmet burger\" for about the same price and probably only a slightly longer wait."}
{"text":"People (staff) were great: No problem at all in that departmentl.  The burger was ...eh....okay; however, for the price, I would rather go to a regular sit-down location, like a Red Robin.  There, the burgers are high-end, the seating is pleasant and the price, for the food, is more reasonable (relative to what you get and the taste)."}
{"text":"Crappy Excuse for a Burger....

1) Tin Foil 
2) Tin Foil with hamburger inside
3) Tin Foil with hamburger inside full of grease
    equals soggy slimy lettuce and tomatoes, cheap cheese, soaked grease bun = a real shitty experience, specially when it costs 13 Dollars for fries and drink. 

 it takes 5 Guys to make a shitty hamburger?


People Don't believe the hype!!! This Place Sucks! 
Save 7 Dollars then go to Whataburger or In n Out

Five Guys Burgers is A MAJOR RIP OFF!!!! WHY PEOPLE PAY FOR THIS SHIT IS BEYOND ME!!

{"text":"My husband and I had a mediocre experience at Five Guys.  We waited for a long time to order (we arrived during the lunch rush) and were disappointed with how long it took for our food to come out.  We probably waited about 25 minutes in total before our food arrived.  I was disappointed when after the long wait my burger wasn't dressed the way I had ordered it.  The burger was still good regardless."}
{"text":"Just a mitigated disaster. Cold and uninviting would be my first words. Second would be messy and unclean. Thirdly, the food. Burger literally fell apart in my hands after the first bite. Was it a burger or a salad? Couldn't tell. Hard to mess up fries which were the best part but other than that it was very subpar. Even the cashier was rude. Hard to swallow a $15 meal that was a mitigated disaster!"}
{"text":"Quick and accurate service consistently. Always smiling staff and always the same staff as far as I can tell. It is convenient to home, but certainly at the top of the good food fast in my opinion."}
{"text":"Consistent, great burgers at this location. My son loves these burgers. 

A little expensive but I'm happy paying a little more for consistent quality! 

Free peanuts!"}
{"text":"I made my first trip to Five Guys last night, after friends told me it was better than Fuddruckers. That is a stretch - but then it's much less expensive. The fries (I had the Cajun) are the best I've had anywhere. The burger was very good, and the service was excellent. The employees are cheerful and attentive. From the bags of potatoes on the floor that greet you when you walk in the door, you know that you aren't at McDonald's. Five Guys is also one of the few places where the drink machines will add the flavor of your choice (several fruits, vanilla, etc.) to your favorite soft drink, or you can leave them out."}
{"text":"There seems to be a lot of debate whether 5 Guys is worth the money. Let me add my two cents. 

I like the burger but do I think it's worth the extra money that you pay over a regular Fast food joint ..... Hmm.... It's a hard call, especially with the proliferation of gourmet burgers and even high class burgers as well. 
I like 5 Guys but it is not on the scale of Burger Priest or Harbours Room (obviously)

Pluses:
Burgers are cooked to order
No proliferation of weird toppings
Free peanuts

Not so goods:
The high price
I personally find the fries kinda bland
No free style machine"}
{"text":"Worse burger I have ever had. This is absolute gut rot and it's hard to be worse than McDonalds or Burger King, but this place has managed to make a burger worse than either one of these two fast food places.
I hate it when a business puts lipstick on a pig in order to try and pass their product off for something it isn't. What this burger is is fast food, but with the inflated prices they charge for this garbage they're trying to pass it off for actual food and I have to tell you, it's nothing less than a complete joke. No taste to it, greasy, small and burnt.
Two thumbs down and if I had more thumbs, I'd use them to give this food extra thumbs down."}
{"text":"Let's get the best thing about Five Guys out of the way, they serve fresh cut french fries so hot, you can't even touch them.  That alone is worth the trip.  I have my own french fry ritual there,  I like to toss my fries in the brown bag that they come in,add pepper and shake them up, then roll the bag down for easy access..   
Five Guys burgers are basic build your own burger, freshly cooked, topped with your favorite toppings and wrapped in foil.  On their menu, they have bread & butter pickles and  fresh jalapeno (not pickled).  Anytime I eat an expensive hamburger, I always think I would rather spend half the money and go to Five Guys.  If they only served booze, I would never want to leave.  I will rate Five Guys four honey buns.  I was about to forget, I LOVE their hot dogs, raw onion, mustard and jalapenos.  Dare I say, it might be better than the burger?"}
{"text":"Great service and a perfect burger!! Love this team .. love the food!! We will be back"}
{"text":"Obama hyped this place up big time! The fat slobs in the office heard there was one in Vegas now and were going crazy over it. I was on that side of town and thought I'd give it a shot. The burger was decent, not what everyone hyped it up to be. The beef was tasty but the buns can't beat in-n-outs buns. I've been here twice. The first time I got the burger plain, so-so. The next time I got it with everything, much better. They over load your bag with fries to the point where you're digging for your burger. Why? I will always choose quality over quantity. The Cajun fries are ok. but just plain, they are horrible. In-and-out beat them here too. I would definitely choose in-n-out over this place in a heart beat. Not worth driving over 10 mins to go to."}
{"text":"Ok so my daughter ordered 3 cheese and fries online nothing special just mayo,lettuce and pickles. Drive over and picked it up, got home and they were not made correctly. So we called and talked to someone named Diego he apologized and said I will refund your money and remake the order the next day because it was almost 10pm.  The next day we go there and all of a sudden Diego don't remember telling us nothing. Basically he lies. We talked too Jennifer a lady who said she was the general manager. Explained what happened, she talked with Diego and again he said Denied the promise. So we spent $30 on 3 hamburgers and fries that was not what we ordered this place is a joke and over priced. And the employees are liars, that have the backing of management. Here the the customer is not right  the customer gets what five guys wants too give you.  If you tell a customer something you better standby your word. Please avoid this place at all cost   So disappointed.  It's back too In & Out were 3 burgers are $15."}
{"text":"For some reason the food wasn't as good here as I remember at other Five Guys.  Too much grease, not enough flavor.  The fries had way way too much salt.  Maybe it was old..."}
{"text":"The same great food I have come to expect from other Five Guys locations - but a lot closer to home. Great service, tasty food and that outstanding drink machine that allows you to choose from a list of flavors to add to your drink. About the only drawback is sparse parking - but the restaurant can't really fix that."}
{"text":"To be honest my expectations were high after so many people said \"Five Guys is the best they've ever had.\"  I should have set my standards a little lower...okay a lot lower.  D and I went for lunch before he went back to work and decided to try it after hearing many people recommend it.  Here's what we ordered:

2 little bacon cheeseburgers, both with mayo, lettuce, pickles, one had bbq sauce and the other had a1 steak sauce and grilled onions.  We also got 2 drinks and 2 medium cajun fries.  It was $30 so we expected amazing Vera's quality type burgers.

The quality did not meet the price we paid...

For the burger itself:
-The burgers were only slightly larger than a standard little cheeseburger at McDonalds
-the patties tasted exactly like McDonalds cheeseburger patties
-the cheese was halfway between Cheezewiz and Kraft Singles consistency and flavour
-my so-called 'grilled onions' were white and raw, lukewarm at best
-neither of us could taste the bbq or steak sauce at all
-the burger itself looked like it had been sat on it was so squished

For the fries:
-first of all $4.19 is a bloody large amount to pay for a medium fries
-if you are going to serve fries in more than one size please use containers that fit the requested quantity (there was so much
overflow from the little cups they give you that we had to dig through the excess to find our burgers in the takeout bag they give you even when you're eating there).  They should have given us either 4 cups full of fries or bigger cups.  or forwarned us how big the portion was and we could have split - we did make it clear that we had never eaten there before when we asked about the burger sizes.

Otherwise the fries were decent if slightly overcooked.

All in all we left feeling like we could have had better value for our money at any cheap fastfood joint, and we really wish that someone would open a Vera's out here...now those are good burgers worth $15/head."}
{"text":"After my Vascetomy, I was all like, yeah fuck bed rest. These pain killers have me hungry as fuck so after I was dropped off at home, no less than three hours later I drove my neutered ass to five guys.

The cheeseburgers are good, the milkshakes are good, the fries are good and they allow you to have free peanuts which is if you don't have a peanut allergy...good.

I've been here like three times and never leave all pissed off and stuff.

If you eat cow meat, eat their cow meat but put cheese on it and maybe some other condiments so you can spice it up a bit."}
{"text":"We are in town for the week on business and we decided to stop in for a Burger and Fries. Great food and even better service! Thank you for the Twix candy bar for our kids."}
{"text":"For a gal who's not a huge fan of red meat, Five Guys has made a burger lover out of me.  I've been to two locations - the one on Val Vista, and just yesterday I visited the new one in the food court at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  Both have been awesome!

Like I said, I'm not normally a burger eater.  But my boyfriend is a Five Guys fan, and his son has recently developed a taste for cow.  So I decided to be a good sport and give it a try.  I have to say, one of the things I love most about Five Guys is that you can get any & all toppings added for free.  Yep, FREE.  Now, the burgers aren't exactly cheap, but still, free toppings are a nice perk.  The place is very casual - you order from the counter, and they call your number when it's ready.

I ordered the \"junior\" cheeseburger, which was pretty darn big!  The regular burgers have two patties, so make sure you're really hungry if you order one.  I added lettuce, ketchup, mustard, mayo, grilled onions, and pickles to mine.  Yum!  It's a good thing they wrap the burgers in foil so you can unwrap a little at a time - the toppings fall out otherwise!  We got fries the first time we went, and they were awesome, but this time we knew we probably wouldn't have room, so we just stuck with the burgers.

In summary: the buns were soft, the meat was perfectly cooked, and we all left with full bellies and smiles on our faces.  For a simple burger joint, you can't ask for much more than that.  :)"}
{"text":"Been to Five Guys a few different times. The best one was in Wisconsin by my Dad's house. Maybe it was just getting to have lunch with him that made it so special.

This is another one of those burger chain places where you can have your order tailored to the way you want. Wow ... what a concept!

Inside has your basic counter service with a large amount of seating around small tables and chairs. The decorations are simple and they seem proud about who they are and what they do. You will always see several \"Best of ____\" signs plastered all over the walls.

Usually order one of the Burgers and a Dog. The Fries are so big that you can split them with a friend or loved one. The orders will promptly arrive in a large greasy brown bag. Normally tear it open and spread it all over the table. Kinda like camping?

Service is always friendly and the food is OK. This is probably not my favorite establishment for burgers or dogs. Everything is pretty expensive considering the type cuisine. Fifteen bucks for a Little Cheese Burger, a Little Fries and a Hot Dog is COO COO CRAZY!

Consider spending a little extra money for a high quality Gourmet Burger somewhere else. There are plenty of tasty places all around this area. Unless you just can't resist the all you can eat Peanut gimmick. PEANUT ALERT!

{"text":"For fast food this is it. I'd argue this place is better than in-n-out. Real burgers the way you want them. And literally every topping you can think of- except green chile. Which is a bummer.  Also. The coke machine is the new modern one with dozens of options.  The fries are legit!!  The only thing I wish is that they had onion rings.  The service is great and the place is always clean."}

Loved all the topping options, loved the peanuts in the shell \"appetizer.\" Did not care for the fries, however. On the day we went, they were quite overdone, and there were really far too many, even for two people. I felt badly about the waste. I will be back on occasion for the burgers- my heart can't take more than that. But I will love every bite..."}
{"text":"These burgers were really tasty, not from frozen patties, fresh toppings, fresh bun, fresh cut fries. I won't whine about the stupid detail another reviewer was whining about where they put an extra scoop of fries in your bag, I thought it was generous and fun, I mean what's the big deal? Take your burger and cup of fries out of the bag, eat some fries from the cup, and tilt the bag and pour the rest into the cup.. or don't eat the bag fries... what is this \"special  way so they don't spill out\" are you whining about Mike b?? how complex can that be? how is that obnoxious? I think what's obnoxious is the fact you complained about such a pointless detail.
I had the bacon cheese burger and I really loved it. 

This is a 50's style burger joint with fresh food, their burgers are nothing like a whopper, as this is fresh unfrozen patty and a whopper is a factory processed burger with fillers, preservatives and is frozen, and  has likely been for months before they make it for you. 

If you are expecting some snooty high end \"gourmet burger\" experience then don't go, if you want a fresh tasty burger,  then this is a good place for one. I mean they make burgers and fries and hot dogs, what are you expecting the place to be?  I think some people tend to expect too much from these places. 

Oh and a word of advice, if you want to keep your fries crispy when taking out, take the napkins out of the bag and don't close it, keep it open, if you don;t, the fries will be soggy by the time you take them out of the bag. 

I think the guy complaining about soggy fries below is not eating in the shop, he's doing take out and likely steaming his fries by closing the bag. 

I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"omg best burger around, i used to love red robin but ever since i discovered five guys there is no going back, the fries are also delish and the peanuts a nice snack while your waiting for your heaven on a bun.. =)"}
{"text":"Fantastic! We love their burgers. They are our go to burger fix. It reminds me of a local place where I grew up. Their little burgers are single patty, their regular burgers are doubles. 

My go to is a cheeseburger. Mayo, ketchup, lettuce, jalape√±os, and hot sauce!  Beau-tiful. Their fries are awesome but huge portions. They also have the high tech coke machines which I love, change my drink everytime."}
{"text":"Typical Five Guys location....very clean, staff was friendly, service was fast, and as always the burgers and fries were excellent. Five Guys is consistently one of my favorite fast casual burger chains and in my opinion no one else (chain) is close...not even that popular west coast chain that has to slop animal sauce on everything. The burgers and toppings here are simple and fresh and the french fries...don't even get me started. Some of the best around and I'll leave it at that. All in all was a good first visit and we are very happy they opened a location away from Southpark. Will definitely be back for our Five Guys fix."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this chain opened up in Canada.

After trying Five Guys (sounds so shady) at the DC airport last year, I've been looking forward to seeing if it could stay consistent with the burgasm attack that rocked the airport that one fine afternoon.

First off, much like the other one, it's a very basic setup. You order, get your number, and wait for about 10 minutes for them to make your food. Some might balk at having to wait that long, but it's worth it.

I opted to go for a basic burger this time (no cheese or bacon, mustard, mayo ketchup, and grilled mushrooms), and found myself a table. It should also be noted that that was no easy task, as most of the free tables hadn't been cleaned.

The verdict? Five Guys Vaughan is guilty of BURGASM in the first degree! The patties were perfectly cooked and falling apart, the mushrooms were just right, and the burger was greasier than a teenagers pillow case. Delicious! I didn't get to put their fries to the test to see if they held up as well, but I'm positive I'll be returning soon."}
{"text":"My husband swears by 5 Guys, and he likely always will. That's great, because when he wants 5 Guys, I can go somewhere I like that he hates. 

Personally, I think the burgers aren't that flavorful and they are nothing special. I've NEVER enjoyed their fries, no matter which location I have gone to (Chris finds one on every road trip possible). They are always over seasoned and under cooked. I HATE soggy fries. 

Also, for the quality (my opinion of their quality), they are WAY overpriced. 
Chris loves the place and even agrees their prices are pretty up there. 

The last time I ate there, we got 3 burgers and 2 drinks (note, NO fries even) and it cost us $22!! 

For that kind of price, I'll go somewhere I actually like for a full meal!"}
{"text":"It is great to see the Five Guys chain making an inroads into the Pittsburgh Market.  Widely famous and extremely popular this chain is know for its fresh ingredients, use of peanut oil in their fryers, and the posting of the origin of their potatoes being used among other awesome quirks such as free peanuts for their customers.  ((So peanut allergy sufferers beware!))

During this particular visit I had a LBC (Little Bacon Cheeseburger) with tomatoes, lettuce, ketchup, mayo, raw onions, grilled mushrooms, and obvious cheese & bacon.  In addition to the LBC which is about the size of a regular patty at any other fast food chain, I had a large order of their Cajun fries and a soft drink.  Total damages after tax, about twelve bucks.  So let's get that out of the way, this place is not cheap, but then again this place isn't a venue you should be eating at on a daily basis anyways...unless you can (1) afford it and (2) don't hold your health in high regard.

Ok, ok, back to the review.  The bun was warmed and slightly toasted, AWESOME.  The burger itself was cooked between medium well and well done ... you had the grilled texture outside but still juicy (juices not bloody) on the inside, and very well seasoned.  The ingredients were top notch, thicker cut bacon played well with the American cheese.  The tomatoes, onions, and lettuce all taste fresh and were the correct temperatures.  The grilled mushrooms were super savory and just enough to taste but not enough to overpower the whole burger.

The fries ... in a word ... glorious.  I'm a sucker for fresh cut fries ... well really anything fried I'm tempted to try.  Their use of peanut oil I'm not sure adds or detracts from the experience (fried is fried to my palate, yes yes I have to make a point to try duck-fat for my next home frying experience).  There was enough Cajun seasoning on them to sizzle the lips & tongue but not enough to wonder if there's potatoes behind all that burning.

They do have that awesome Coke fountain that has the touch screen and the different flavorings, so in one night I tried:  Coke Zero Lime, Coke Zero Vanilla, Sprite Zero Orange, Sprite Zero Cherry, and Peach *gasp* Regular *double gasp* Sprite.  If you haven't guessed it--I'm a big pop drinker.

The overall feel of this particular establishment stuck true to the franchise/chain and to past experiences I've had in other locations.  The service was quick (even when it was super busy) and courteous which is the least I expect if I'm paying twelve bucks for a burger, fries, and drink.

Do keep in mind this is a fast-food establishment.  While the price range is something more like a sit-down place...in the end...you're still at a fast food joint so food-snobs and dieters beware, you might not have a grande ole time.  But if you're ready to let loose and have a \"guilty-pleasure\" type experience, I highly recommend Five Guys Burgers and Fries."}
{"text":"Excellent food for a fast food restaurant.  French fries are excellent and remind me of boardwalk fries I use to get in California.  It is definitely pricey for a fast food restaurant but the quality is there.  Staff are all incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"When that craving for a fresh grilled-type hamburger hits, I'm looking for the closest Five Guys.  Luckily, I was close by this one yesterday when that urge hit!

It was around 12 PM, & the lunch rush from Presby Hospital & the Reese Blvd. business park had not arrived yet.  I was able to walk in & place my order immediately.  As with every other Five Guys, the friendly employees greet you before you even get to the register.

Yesterday, I got my usual: little bacon burger with ketchup, mustard, pickles, & jalape√±os.  Within about 6 - 7 minutes, I was on my way with my glorious burger.  

The place was very clean, high sanitation grade, & the drink area was free of clutter & trash.  There's plenty of seating & lots of windows for natural light.  I love that you're able to see the \"kitchen\" area all out in the open.  You can watch them cook & prepare the burgers & fries."}
{"text":"Five Guys never seems to disappoint. This location has friendly employees, quick service & perfect burgers & fries. 

It always seems an employee is tidying up the restaurant at all times. It's always clean.

My little bacon burger is cooked to perfection, the bacon is crisp & the pickles always have that great dill taste. Now, the jalape√±os...oooh weeee, they are RIPE & hot!

Cajun fries are a must, but only the regular size, which are perfect for sharing!"}
{"text":"A bit expensive but worth it. Always great food and service. I recommend the cajun fries! They give you a genorous helping of fries too...a small can easily feed 2."}
{"text":"proof that a chain can be consistent... i've found it!  i was staying down the street on business, and stopped in one night for a quick burger.  the experience here was just like the ones at home.  super friendly people - they are quick to greet you the second you walk through the door.  burger was tasty.  c'mon, it's a fast food burger, so i'm not hailing it as the best thing ever.  but as far as paper-wrapped food goes, these are pretty darned good."}
{"text":"Ask an East Coaster and they'll say that Five Guys serves up the best burgers ever.  Before Five Guys arrived in Vegas, the folks off the \"wrong coast\" would show up in town, insult our beloved In n' Out, and say we didn't know a great burger because we'd never had Five Guys.

Well now that Five Guys is in town, it's Game On.  And the outcome in the question of who serves up a better burger?  I'd love to deliver a definitive winner, but I'm calling it a tie.

There's no doubt that Five Guys serves up a delicious burger--a greasy, thick, delicious burger.  The ground beef they use makes one of the best, if not the best, burger patty in fast food.  It's a thicker patty than In n' Out and juicier.  Take a bite and a mixture of grease and cooked meat juice will run down your fingers.  Favorite toppings?  Five Guys probably has them and will load up your burger with most toppings without an extra charge (grilled onions, jalapenos, mushrooms, etc.)  Pretty impressive for a fast food chain.

If there's anything that gives an edge to Five Guys, it's the fries.  If you get the fries with \"cajun seasoning,\" they come out tossed in delicious Old Bay seasoning -- think spicy and peppery without lighting your tongue on fire.  Old Bay is a rarity in Las Vegas and I'll head here just to get those fries.

Bottom line: As Samuel L. Jackson would say \"Mmmmmm . . . This IS a tasty burger!\"  One of the best burgers in the valley for the price."}
{"text":"Well the dead cockroaches on the floor greet you when you come in and then the person at the register wants you to hurry and tell her how many patties you need before you have a chance to even look at the menu. The only reason I dont feel bad about the one star is that the burger was good. Good luck 5 Guys!"}
{"text":"First time going to a Five Guys was yesterday.  I'm a fan.  When you're craving good old fashioned greasy burger and want to break your diet...this is the place to go.  According to their nutritional information...a cheesburger will provide you with ~133% of your recommended daily intake of saturated fat.  Can anyone say.....YUM?!

It's definitely a fast-food type place...but its rather pricey for fast food.  A burger/fries/drink will be about ~$10.  It's worth it though.  I had the cheeseburger, which is a double patty, with everything on it except mushrooms and pickles.  While I'm a huge In-N-Out fan...these burgers are a level up from In-N-Out in my opinion.  Maybe cuz they are so unhealthy, it just adds to the deliciousness factor.  Probably from all the peanut oil they use to cook everything in.  The fries are pretty good too...really fresh."}
{"text":"I love burgers. I've said it once, and ill say it again, my last meal on earth would absolutely be a burger. It will be juicy and meaty, the bun will be dry and toasty and there will be more pickles than you can count.. It will be accompanied by a mound of delicious french fries and a giant milkshake... Today at lunch, I was invited to try a new burger joint, which apparently everyone loves, and was told that my love affair with In&Out would be shattered.. Well, that was a lie. 

I got a cheese burger, fries and a cherry coke. The sheer fact that there is fountain cherry coke automatically merits a star. I liked the options I got for toppings, I chose mayo, pickles, sauteed mushrooms, lettuce and A-1..  I've got to admit, I was excited, really excited.. however, that excitement was quickly shattered when I got my meal.. I unwrapped the tin foil, hoping to find a delicious juicy cheeseburger, just for me.. yeah well, I found a burger, just for me, but it was WET. The entire bun was drenched.. THIS, ladies and gents, this disgusts me to no end. One of the words I hate most in the world is moist, and I also hate when things that are not supposed to be moist, are moist. Especially bread. BARF. The meat wasn't very flavorful either.. and they used portobello mushrooms, that were cold. I frowned. My lunch date frowned back. The fries were apparently from Shelly Idaho, I know this because they have a \"Todays fries are from..\" board.. they taste just like In&Outs, just thicker.. so basically it is imperative that you order them well done.

The place is big, holds a lot of people and they are really well staffed, but the meal was just meh.. and for the two of us the total came out to be $22.00. TWENTY TWO DOLLARS for 2 cheeseburgers, fries and a drink.. for real?? 

Whatever, i know its inevitable that I will give this place another shot, mostly because I work next door, and Fat Burger doesn't do it for me.. But I was just really really sad with the whole experience. I don't eat burgers often, so when I do its a treat, and well, this was not a treat. 

*sigh*"}
{"text":"I normally write very long, detailed reviews.  This one shall be short and sweet.  After at least 20 visits to this store, here is my quick review:

1.)  Fast, friendly service with a smile - each and every time.
2.)  Good, hot and always consistent food - each and every time.
3.)  Clean, outside / inside / bathroom - each and every time.
4.)  Always leave feeling full, satisfied and that I got the bang for my buck! - each and every time.
5.)  The key word here is consistent.  This is my favorite burger place in Vegas on overall experience.  Gordon Ramsay BurGR is second - but twice as much.
6.)  P.S. - I love the \"Three in the door!\" and the responses back and forth between the staff - they actually look like they enjoy working here and enjoy serving people.  Good for them and Great on the management of this top notch fast food / dining casual establishment.  
 
I am Las Vegas for life.  And they have my business for life at this level of operation."}
{"text":"I've basically been to every fast food burger joint in the US, and Five Guys is head and shoulders above everything else. 

Let's start with the fries. These aren't your momma's fries (honestly, I don't even know what this means, but I've always wanted to use it in a sentence), these are fries of substance. These are fresh, oil-battered fries of delicious goodness. And by goodness, I don't mean for your arteries, I mean for your taste buds. 

And then the burger, oh their burgers. You can't get a better deal for your money than one of their $3-4 burgers. Keep in mind that their default burgers come with 2 patties, so if you're feeling like a pansy, tell them you only want one. The burgers are juicy and well cooked, with any amount of toppings you want. 

The next best burger place would be In-N-Out, but that's like saying silver comes after gold. It doesn't even come close."}
{"text":"Big Deal. So many people have been raving about this place so I finally took the time to go check it out and while it was certainly a yummy double cheese burger with Bacon, I dint see it worth being $12/burger. I guess I was expecting a lot more because of all the hype but for me sadly it's just another place to get a burger"}
{"text":"Amazing every time and all the time. This time I was their last customer of the night. Most places will treat you terribly when you are there at closing but not these guys. They always greet you with a smile and the place is amazingly clean. Peanuts to get you started and the soda machine has about a thousand different choices."}
{"text":"First time to a Five Guys. Mentioned that to the girl behind the counter hoping to get some kind of insight into the whole Five Guys experience but got nothing. (I'm a real customer experience guy) 

Didn't know anything about the food but it looked like a cool place to eat. The decor is cool - the whole red and white theme is kind of retro. Ordered a Bacon Burger, Fries, and a drink. Didn't know anything about the menu. Opened the bag and saw nothing but fries - thought that was cool and indeed the fries were excellent! (hence the two stars - they lost 1 star for the customer service and 2 for the burger!)  I pulled out the burger and discovered that the regular burger has 2 patties. I have a pretty hearty appetite and thought okay, this otta be good. Sadly both patties were completely overcooked. As I was sitting there, I saw a sign that said \"We cook our meat juicy and well done\". Well, in my book, juicy and well done is kind of a oxymoron. Juicy to me is a nice strip of pink in the middle of the burger with the juice running down my hand when I take a bite.  Well done is just...well, sucks. 
So I thought, let's squeeze the burger and look for the juicyness....nothin'. Kind of skimpy on the ketchup and mayo too.  Choked down the burger, enjoyed the fries and coke. 

Not sure I'll be spending $12 bucks for another Five Guys burger and fries anytime soon. (for the money, Red Robin is a much better deal)"}
{"text":"Great burgers & fries!! JUST MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR EXTRA WELL DONE FRIES! Love this place, as long as you get well done fries you are golden...unless you like the limp way they usually make the fries!"}
{"text":"It's always a decision of this place or In-N-Out. This place has been winning out more and more often. It has some juicy burgers and it doesn't skimp on size. You get the same quality, but you get a lot more choices for toppings. No fancy or secret menu's, just pick what you want and get it hot and fresh.

The only let down is that the fries are not good re-heated or cold. Eat'em while you can, just don't plan on doggy-bagging them. And I do have fun with the peanuts while I wait. Afterwards, I can just swing next door and get some frozen yogurt, if I have room, that is.

This location is always clean and the staff has always been courteous. Just be warned, don't try this place after any soccer matches. That's when it gets belly button to bunghole and gets a tad over-crowded."}
{"text":"Another day...another Five Guys to review! At this rate, I'll have hit up every location in the greater Charlotte area.

I've been to this one a few times before & it's consistent with every other one I've been to.  

Clean, bright, & inviting. Friendly employees, minimum wait time for my burger order; in & out under five minutes. 

My little bacon burger was perfect - cooked nicely, bacon was crisp, & the pickles & jalape√±os were fresh.

No complaints. :)"}
{"text":"Out & about on a Friday about lunch time & got a \"to go\" little bacon burger (my usual).  

The two gentleman employees were so friendly, wholeheartedly welcomed me as soon as I walked up to the counter. 

While I did have to wait an unusual amount of time for my burger - even though they weren't busy - I was perfectly content snacking away on the peanuts & sipping my Coca-Cola.

My burger was yummy & the burger patty seemed a bit larger & thicker than I'm used to seeing, which of course made me happy! The pickles & jalape√±os were fresh.

Restaurant was clean...

Parking can be an issue, as the location is sharing spaces with other businesses."}
{"text":"Five Guys, well...
( A Cheese Burger + A Large Fries + A Regular Coke ) + Tax = $16.80 CAD
Because of their loud music, the girl who took my order couldn't hear when I said I want a \"Large fries\".

The burger was a two patty burger with 2 pieces of Cheese and \"Pickles, Tomatoes, Grilled Onions, Grilled Mushrooms, Jalapeno Peppers, Ketchup & Mustard\" (say it ten times fast!!)
the cashier(??)/server actually repeat it like 3 times to confirm with me, with a \"fast-forward\" speed.
(may be it's a requirement??)

The Fries were fresh cut fries(?) with the skin on, so it's the kind of fries that I love. Besides on what they put in the cup that serves the fries in, they put a lot more in the paper bag. (I think to a point it's double the amount?)
(To a guy who is Fries-maniacs that didn't had 1 single fries for a week, this is beyond your wildest dream)

The drinks were all you can drink... (Free refills) 
Coca-cola is always the best to pair with burger and fries.

I guess it's a nice place to hang out, have some peanuts (they have bulk peanuts that's all you can eat (I think) ), and have your belly push to the blink of an explosion. XD

Conclusion: It's a nice experience, but not something you want to do on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Free peanuts!! It's great - just don't get salted out 

This popular US franchise is a great spot to grab an appetite filling burger. $$ side, but the convenience of ordering a burger with your choice of toppings including - saut√©ed mushrooms or caramelized onions- making it understandable why a burger costs to 10$! Junior burgers have one meat patty bs a regular sized burger  has 2 patties (1$ difference). Sides are available at an additional cost (Reg or Cajun fries, shakes- their speciality, hot dogs, etc..)

Seating is plenty in this resto (including outdoor seating, the staff was nice. Be warned on a summer's day - this place gets packed! Wait time is short. Parking is an inconvenience due to the grocery stores and restos sharing the parking lot."}
{"text":"A nice change of pace from the overpriced restaurants in the area.  Five guys is a name you know and love.  The front counter attendant was all smiles and very friendly.  The rest of the staff was very friendly and engaged in playful banter while they cooked.  They knew why everyone was downtown tonight unlike other places we had tried to get into.  Remarkably clean and the staff was on top of any spills instantly.  Now that I know this five guys is downtown I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I most certainly love Five Guys Burgers & Fries! Dude, even their hot dogs rock!"}
{"text":"So my son and I decided we hadn't been to Five Guys in a long while - like over a year.  Went there tonight around 720pm and there were equal numbers of employees to customers - about 5 each.  

Two burgers, one a double cheeseburger the other one a regular cheeseburger and one big order of fries.  Dropped $25 bucks.  Only one person ahead of us but took about 4-5 minutes for their order (for 2 people).  Even though the place was not busy - the employees seemed more interested interacting with each other than customers.

Got done ordering and was waiting.  Young lady came back into the place 2x's working to get her order correct...made my spidey sense go off.  We got our order to go and headed out  - didn't want to deconstruct and reconstruct the contents of the bag..  Got home and both burgers were doubles, and one of them didn't have onions (contrary to the order).    Mediocre at best but for a Scottsdale level price. 

Oh well, I think the next period that we go dark for Five Guys will be much longer than the last.  Habit is very good alternative."}
{"text":"Yes it is bad for you. Yes it is delicious. Great customer service. Clean, fast and predictable."}
{"text":"I don't try new hamburger stands, I guess the reason why, is I feel out of place. Everyone is so busy here, I wouldn't have known the peanuts were free, or what was expected when you place an order. The person talking the order was perturbed by my ignorance, and was willing to express it. The food was good, but very greasy and I loved the fries. The price was a little more than it was worth. The price four cheese burgers and 3 fries, no drinks was $34.85. It is better to eat everything there, the food gets cold if you have to travel and distance at all."}
{"text":"Everything is nice and fresh but the only down fall is their prices for a hamburger, way overrated. The staff is super nice...so so nice that they messed up on two of our burgers and I wasn't upset with them...very polite and fixed it but I'd rather stick with IN ~ OUT...sorry five guys :-)"}
{"text":"Burgers here are in the top three for me. All toppings are made fresh and the meat is grilled perfect every time. The parking is not bad but a little awkward to navigate. The only downside to this place is that it's a bit on the expensive side. But in my opinion it's well worth the money."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep returning to Mc' D's when there are burger joints like Five Guys. The staff is always in a good mood and ready to prepare an All-American good, fresh, and hot burgers and fries. Oh, and this Five Guys has one of those Coca-Cola machines of the future. I love those. Over 100 corn syrup flavors. Hahaha....Its a great pit stop before and after leaving Vegas, if your not full from your Vegas trip."}
{"text":"I fell in love with Five Guys back when I lived in DC. It is such a DC institution - and I don't think anywhere can ever beat the Georgetown location. So I was nervous walking into this Five Guys. Could it possibly hold up? I've dined at a Midwest Five Guys location, and I didn't think it was very good. So yeah, I was a little nervous.

But that nervousness quickly grew to anticipation as we approached the location and began the search for parking. Once finally entering, the anticipation became a desperate hunger. Despite the line being quite long, it moved relatively quickly. It was around 20 minutes from the time we got in the line until the time we received our order.

A huge smile came over my face as that paper bag with grease spots coming through was set in front of me. As I unwrapped my burger, I couldn't help but stop and stare. It was a thing of beauty. Awww, Five Guys, we meet again. I took a big bite and relished in child-like joy as juicy goodness started to run down my hands. The two patties, the cheese, the bacon, the crisp lettuce and tomato - so fab! And then I dived into the Cajun fries. Crispy outside, soft inside, and covered in a spicy mix that is such savory deliciousness. Yes, it was just as good as I remembered from in DC. Yes, it did totally hold up to the DC area locations. Yes, yes, yes. 

My personal note on the fries: You have to go with the Cajun fries. The Cajun seasoning totally makes the fries."}
{"text":"I didn't have the fries, so I likely missed the best part. I had the little bacon cheeseburger w/ grilled onions, mushrooms, relish, tomato and mustard.
For a burger with so much accouterment, it was impressively bland. It's as if the grill hasn't been seasoned, like you would season a skillet. The $6 burger tasted fatty and rich, but not flavorful or savory.

I enjoyed five guys in nyc and nc and don't recall the blandness. For my slightly higher-end burger dollar, I'll opt for In N Out."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at 5 guys in my life and I have went to several locations on several occasions.  Tonight, however, was different.  Messed up order twice, cold and hard buns, cold burger, and staff that spent too much time dicking around and not enough time doing their jobs or providing the type of service 5 guys is known for.  Disappointed and will not be back to this location :(.  Sad considering it's down the road from my house!"}
{"text":"Best burger place in Las Vegas hands-down. Staff is usually very friendly and professional. The stores are always clean.they always give you an abundance of food especially their wonderful french fries."}
{"text":"Good taste, but there is the in and out and smash burger about a mile away. I felt very expensive. For a burger, fries, and drink with tax for $14.19.
Is it really better than In and out? In specifically what part? I couldn't find it for $14.19. I would go to a place lower than $10 like In and Out or to a fine restaurant in the strip even though I will pay additional $5 or more.
Don't forget, you are in vegas! Lots lots choices to go for a burger!!"}
{"text":"Just ok
Way too much mayo
Burger so so. Fries good
VERY annoying that the guys sweeping while were eating nasty (sorry) maybe dont sweep so hard stuff flying...
Idk"}
{"text":"Way overrated!  Not a good value.  Overpriced burgers that are greasy.  The fries are just so-so.  Takes a long time for fast food.  The staff are friendly.  Located on the outside of the mall in the front closer to Dillards."}
{"text":"I appreciate they don't overcook their burgers to the typical Canadian rubber patties, I always order medium - medium rare patties in the states. For a fast food burger, this is on par with the chain restaurant burgers in Canada but at a fraction of the price. I liked my spicy Cajun fries. It's a good option to have in mission."}
{"text":"If you love burgers, you will love the food at this place! Big juicy real meat burgers are as good as it can get!  Also love the free peanuts they offer!  If I was to rate the burger for quality & taste only, it would be 5 stars. That's the positives.
For me, the bun is too soft and tends to get soggy.  The girl who handles the money also hands you your drink cups with her dirty fingers all over the Top Rim of your cup. As for the decor, if you like sitting at tables surrounded by sacks of potatoes, you're gonna love this place!"}
{"text":"I will never go back to this restaurant. One of the workers put the wrong fry in the bag. He refused to give me another one. Instead he provided me a bag and salt and told me to shake them myself. I left and immediately reported his behavior."}
{"text":"Whoa, whoa, whoa!!  Pay ATTENTION!  I'm pretty sure that was the best burger I've ever had!  The flavor was fantastic!  

I had the \"bacon cheeseburger\", which comes as a double, (which is standard, you apparently have to order specifically to get one patty), with fried onions, mushrooms, lettuce and ketchup. OMG!  

So juicy, so flavorful, and a really nice size, too. I didn't get any fries, but they looked good. 

I noticed two interesting signs on the wall, one: \"Today's potatoes come from: ID, \"Tibbits Farm\"\", and two: \"All our burgers are cooked Juicy and Well Done\". 

The restaurant looked nice, 50's style red & white, and very noisy, lots of hustle and bustle, especially with the order-fillers BELLOWING out the order numbers!  

Fun place. My wife was not happy I tried it by myself, so we're going back, tonight!!"}
{"text":"The workers here at five guys are like my best friend.  No kidding.  My friend LIVES for burgers, so we are constantly here.  Hey, and who doesn't like FREE peanuts?!  If you complain about this place, then you don't have the tastebuds to handle the awewsomness.  Nuff Said."}
{"text":"Overrated!  I'm not quite sure what all the hype is about.  I've been here a few times and I still don't get it.  

Don't get me wrong.  The burgers are good.  They're fresh and cooked to order.  The fries are okay.  The only thing that stand out about the fries is they give you enough in one order to feed four people.

Overall this place is fine, but I won't go out of my way to go there.  If you're near by stop in and try it.  If you're not, you can find something as good or better near you."}
{"text":"Excellent burger and fries!  Our go to hamburger joint. Had the burger \"my\" way, love all the toppings. Heads up, fries size is huge and can be shared. Peanuts before dinner make it even better, oh and the million different type soda machine is just final reason."}
{"text":"Burger 3/5. It has a home made feel to it. Bun is soft. Meat patty is just alright. Not something I would crave for, but wouldn't oppose coming back. Cajon fries: 3/5. Nice n thick.  couldn't get over this weird after taste. Im thinking its the peanut oil they fry them in. Overall, no complaints. It's no in n out, but not bad."}
{"text":"This is our go-to no fuss burger place. Only shake shack can beat this but their fries are much better than shake shack. Their patties, although well done, are always juicy. Our orders are Dad:Cheeseburger, mayo, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, jalape√±o, lettuce, tomato Mom: Little bacon cheeseburger, lettuce, tomato, mayo Son1:Bacon cheeseburger,¬† mayo, grilled mushrooms Son2: Bacon cheeseburger, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, mayo, lettuce tomato Son3: Bacon cheeseburger with extra bacon 
Large fries + Regular fries - this list is saved on my phone!"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with a five guys burger and some Cajun fries. I had been trying to eat vegan and suddenly had a craving for a cheeseburger and when I had that first bite I felt like I died and gone to heaven. HA! It's greasy, cheesy, completely unhealthy and AMAZING! They give you a lot of options too, mushrooms, jalape√±os, bacon, and all the other good stuff. Word on the street is that they sell hotdogs too but who would get that when you could eat a burger- am I right!! I also love that you can eat peanuts while waiting and color fun little note cards to hang on the wall. Winning!"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with the restaurant, the service was friendly the place seemed clean and they give you a ton of food (it is pricey though $30 for two people for reg burger/small burger fries and a shake dayum!) I'm just personally not a fan of the food I don't get the big deal, I asked for mine with ketchup which I always do at any other restaurant not thinking it would be marinated in it, every bite was a Heinz explosion and just not what I was looking for and the fries were eh nothing special. But that's just my taste buds my boyfriend devoured his and loved every second of it so to each his own!"}
{"text":"1. I was greeted right away.   

2. Cashier was very kind and funny.  

3. Got a little burger( that is not really little at all) with fresh jalape√±o peppers with Cajun fries.  Burger was awesome.  Fresh ingredients.  Fries were a little too spicy for me but good.  

4. I come here once a quarter for my \"indulge...eat whatever I want\" day.  Service is always awesome. Not to mention the food.  Fresh and delicious.  I wish I could give this guys 10 stars.  Great work!!!!

I shall return soon....more like within the next 90 days. Oh  yes."}
{"text":"Ok but expensive for what it is? Not enough difference between their Burger and IN and OUT burger whose is just as good or better and not nearly as expensive! The fries are better here but not enough to bring me back.due to the prices on their burger"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Five Guys both in New Jersey (loved it) and Henderson, NV (average), and I was waiting for this Summerlin location to open up, as it's about a block away from my work. Given that it just opened, it's clean and inviting, and the staff is welcoming and enthusiastic. The manager seemed to very much be on top of quality control for the food that went out.

I ordered:
1 regular-size bacon cheeseburger (2 patties), with grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, jalapenos, and steak sauce
1 regular-size order of fries (good for 2-3 people, easily)
1 large drink

The burger was juicy and delicious, without being overly greasy. Their patties aren't too large, so their standard 2 patties are about the equivalent of one regular-sized Smashburger. I would've preferred a bit more sauce, but they don't go so heavy on the toppings that it overpowers the burger's flavor.

The fries were fresh from the fryer, and although they ostensibly put them in a large cup, as is standard with Five Guys, they pretty much overfill the cup and fill up the entire bottom half of the bag with fries. Great if you love fries, and their fries are really good (I love skin-on fries), but don't expect to finish them all by yourself.

They use a dial-a-drink soda machine, which I love for the variety and customizability, and I like to take advantage of that by getting drinks you don't find everywhere - in this case, Cherry Vanilla Mr. Pibb Zero.

Overall, I had a good experience. This Five Guys location is definitely better than their Henderson location (maybe because it's newly-opened?), and it'll be good competition for Smashburger and In-N-Out right down the road."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of five guys burgers but this place is really sub par!  The last 3 times I've been to this location they have messed up my order and today was no different.  My cheeseburgers had no cheese and the meat had absolutely no seasoning.  I'm so disappointed with this location it's time to skip this place."}
{"text":"Just went to this location and stood at the counter ready to order.  The crew just stood there talking about how they were going split their tips.  Completely ignored until we finally left.  Terrible service.  Go some place else!!"}
{"text":"First time at this location but a loyal 5 Guys alum; everyone here was friendly but not the fake friendly.  Service was prompt, piping hot and truly delicious. 

I tried the little bacon cheeseburger this time - I mean can you go wrong with fresh griddled beef for one - then bacon? Um no! No you can't BC bacon is a gift from the universe.  I got the LBC with grilled onions and fresh, bright green seeded jalape√±os.  And yes I got a small Cajun fry...it's worth any old person heartburn I may get tonight.  Fresh toppings are free - the LBC and the small fries came to $9.98 so more $ than fast food traditionally but so good! 

I sat and ate a few fresh peanuts while it cooked - got it to go - and made it thru five when it was done - fast fresh and delicious.  This used to be my go to for hangover food now it's pregnancy cravings - different but still perfect. 

If you have the room highly recommended the shakes with free mix ins!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad to finally have a Five Guys in my neighborhood!  The employees are always friendly and greet me when I order, and it doesn't usually take long to receive my food.  And, the finally product is fantastic!  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Another burger joint of the week place. OK so I get it. Good burger and I do not like soft fries anywhere so I will not comment on the fries. Interesting taste in the burgers. Very popular niche type place. Again it will satisfy the occasional craving."}
{"text":"The food is good but not great. The hamburger was very squished inside the aluminum and I would understand that at a fast food place but not in a place where they make it right there and then. I loved the fries though."}
{"text":"I love five guys but today I could only give it two stars burgers are still great the problem was after I ate half my burger there was no burger on the other side of the bun WTF so it seems now the burgers are getting smaller I didn't think it would happen but oh God I'm about to cry no more five guys LOL"}
{"text":"Always had great food from here and great service.  Today they comped about $40 worth of food because their payment system was down.  That's awesome."}
{"text":"Good: They were very friendly and the store is new and clean with a nice raised outdoor patio and it's next to Starbucks. 

Not good: $5 for a BLT. Nothing else. Not what I was expecting at all. Basically a burger without the burger. Cold dry bun. 1 slice of tomato. Iceberg lettuce. Old tasting crumbly hard bacon. No mayo. No condiments of any kind. Dry, boring, overpriced, unsatisfying. Felt like they just figured out a way to throw together their leftover ingredients without a burger and make it sound like something good and make a huge profit off ingredients that cost them a quarter."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Five Guys, I was eager to try them out.  Alas, they're very overrated, in my view.  The burgers are so thin and overcooked, they're almost tasteless.  The toppings are impressive, but the point of a topping should be to accentuate the taste of the burger, not overwhelm and disguise it.  But the burgers themselves are just weird--instead of one reasonably thick burger, they put two insanely thin burgers on top of each other.  Not recommended.   Mind you, the fries are almost edible."}
{"text":"The burgers and the fries were the same as any other five guys restaurant. They were burgers.  but I got a Tell ya, two cheeseburgers and a large fry and one drink $27 is crazy.  will not be back at these prices. I can see why this chains in trouble, there were more employees than there were customers at dinnertime. Hoss,s steakhouse was cheaper than this!"}
{"text":"A lil pricey for just burgers and dogs. I guess the free peanuts are supposed to make up for it? Oh can't forget to mention the great soda machines as well"}
{"text":"Where to start with 5 Guys Burgers and Fries... well, I guess with the hype; it was not deserved. It would seem this establishment has a fervent following and while that is nice, I cannot see why it is so.

The menu: The menu is VERY basic. Burgers, fries, hotdogs, a few other things and that is it. Now, with a limited menu like that you would suppose the food would be absolutely awesome since they are betting everything you will like the few offered items. Well, in my opinion there is a long way to go with such an extreme \"statement\" concerning their food.

Your Basic Order: I ordered the regular (double patty) bacon cheese burger, large fries and a medium drink. My wife ordered a little cheese burger (single patty, what a scam) and a medium drink and the bill came to over $21. (Oh yeah, we split a large fries) That put the price more than our regular joint for burgers and even more than an average night at Buffalo Wild Wings.  By making the regular a double patty they up the average price of the order significantly. I honestly did not know I had ordered a double until it was pointed out that the \"little\" was a single. I find that deceptive in a way, although I applaud the bald face deceit. It does mean that I will NOT be returning however since they really do not want to be honest with their customers (although there are other reasons as well).

Order Up: If there were no grilled onions on that burger it would not have had any taste. Was the burger juicy? Sure, if you like steam, but last time I checked steam added very little taste. The fixin's were fresh but the bacon was not and the cheese slid all over the place. The bun was too soft for such a hardy burger and ended up as a mess as well. IMHO, these people do not know how to make a burger, but then again very few places do. And then there were the fries... Fresh Potatoes, check. Hot Oil, check. Potatoes presoaked, um... maybe not. Two step frying process, not a chance. So what do you think we got? If you said a large order of limp and fairly tasteless fries you would be right. What a disappointment.

Bringing down the house: I will say one thing that did impress me; the place was clean and there were always people cleaning. Otherwise, bags of potatoes stored in the common area may be neat but I wonder what people do to them before they get processed into fries. I am not sure it is against health code but would be surprised if it weren't. As for having a conversation with anyone else while eating, forget it. The music and noise of the place was not conducive to banter of any type. In fact it served to drive you out of the place as soon as possible. Pitiful.

Summing it all up: Too expensive for what you get, unless you think a burger should taste like grilled onions. Limp fries are a joke and mass quantities are no cure. Finally, bring earplugs. I honestly do not know where the hype comes from and there is no way it is justified. 

Fatburger is a better experience and you will save a few bucks as well."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptic to go in at first my brother has only good to say about it..so one day for dinner me husband and I went in and the place was loud but I guess it comes with the theme of the place. We got up to register and well it's pretty basic we ordered 2 cheeseburgers but to them that is 2 patties not 1. And can get as many toppings as we wan. The patty itself is home made like it's not perfect circle. And I recommend the Cajun fries!!!!!! They are good!!!!! Place is just as pricy as in-n-out tho but overall pretty good!"}
{"text":"Their burgers are so freakin' good. So fresh, so juicy, so delicious. I've eaten here so many times and I've never gotten sick of it or had a bad experience. Food is always great, service is always great!"}
{"text":"OMG pure heaven. This place blew my whole families mind. Top notch burgers and fries. We will definitely be back.They are pricey but you get what you pay for. They blow In n Out out of the water."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!  - We finally have a Five Guys near us so I had waited to try any FG's as we would have one soon.  I was very pleased and glad FG's is now here!  To me the meat wasn't greasy as fresh, not frozen meat which will always be juicier and have more flavor.  The fries are very good, note the \"small fry\" is plenty for 2+ people!
Sure it's not cheap, but when is a quality product?  Regarding the noise, sure it's a bit louder, but with a busy open kitchen, hard flooring/ceiling surfaces this will happen.  Oh, love the Coke Freestyle machines!"}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 7/10 -- Service: 10/10 -- Ambiance/D√©cor: 7/10

The reason this place deserves a review is because the service is so good. This is corny, but I always leave this restaurant feeling great because everyone there is so nice. Unless these were just random letters written on my receipt, the employee in charge of my order yesterday was named Pat. Without exception, I've received super friendly experience from every employee I've interacted with there. 

Food-wise, I've honestly never understood the craze and could not tell you a Five Guys burger tastes that much better than any other burger I've eaten. The patty is maybe juicier than a Big Mac but now I'm just looking for differences that I didn't immediately notice when eating. 

They are filling though. I eat a lot and I've resorted to getting the Little Burgers now. I like how they have grilled mushrooms and grilled onions as free topping options. I've tried the regular burgers and the burgers with bacon and I don't really feel like the bacon adds anything. 

I also usually get a regular size cajun fries, which is always too much but I never learn my lesson. A Little Burger and a Little fries would be enough, especially because they fill the fries container and then scoop another container full into the bag. They're nothing special, but they taste good and sometimes I just crave the cajun flavouring because I'm not familiar with any other place in Markham that does that with their fries.

I guess $11 is kind of expensive for a burger and fries (no drink) if you're just looking for cheap fast food, but the service and location are good and parking is always plentiful."}
{"text":"Today I went to this location for the second time in awhile. First of all, the prices are much too high. I ordered the smallest cheeseburger, the smallest fry, and the smallest drink and it still cost me $12. Five Guys needs to either make a combo that's less expensive than that or they need to realize that they are going to lose customers because of their unreasonable prices. Secondly, both times I've been there, the cashiers have been less than welcoming. My cashier today (I can't remember her name) answered my question with a look of boredom on her face, basically telling me that she has better things to do and can't be bothered to waste her time. This happened the last time I was there as well. From a customer's point of view, I did not feel welcomed at all, but had already agreed to meet a friend there for lunch. Five Guys' only saving grace is their food. Their food is consistently pretty good, but with prices and employees like that, I'd much rather go to a different place."}
{"text":"This is by far the best fast food burger in Gastonia.  We stopped in for a late bite to eat and all the employees were so nice and friendly!  The food was really fresh and tasted great.  The restaurant was very clean.  We really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Great products!! All the food is delicious, there is a big Lists of add ons! I know this is known for there burgers, but I love the hotdogs. Remember this is not a fast food place, they cook everything fresh and that takes a bit of time."}
{"text":"Five Guys is one of the best spots to hit up when you're on keto on trying to keep it low carb. They're on the pricier end when it comes to burgers, but you're pretty much guaranteed to be satisfied and full once you're done.

I love getting the bacon cheese burger (minus the bun) in either a bowl or wrapped in lettuce. Their beef and bacon is so tasty and quite a lot thicker than In-and-Out, and you can get really creative with the toppings. I usually like to pile on mustard, jalape√±os, hot sauce, tomatoes, and dip it all in mayo on the side. 

There's plenty of room inside and it's never as packed or chaotic as In-and-Out. They also have the custom soda machine where you can add cherry/vanilla/orange/etc to your usual drinks. I usually spend about $10 or so for a huge burger, but it's a fun treat."}
{"text":"Juicy patties, nice bun and a boat load of fries. The condiments, toppings and ventilation system could use some work though. Although it's a bit pricey, it isn't too bad given the Toronto standards. But I would rather have In N Out or Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Gotta love the burgers and fries at Five Guys. Simple menu, good grub for the whole meat eating species. 

Cajun fries are a nice new flavor. Feed me Seymour!"}
{"text":"I also used to live minutes from the original Five Guys in VA and I also agree that NOTHING has changed. The consistency of this chain is incredible, especially for a fast food place that does everything naturally. Natural beef, veggies, even the fries are cooked in peanut oil. Hence all the free peanuts! And all the \"YUPP's\" every twenty minutes... Have you ever been to a McDonald's or BK that the employees were EXCITED about their job? Yeah, didn't think so. Not only is their customer service impeccable, it's an art. I've never seen anyone not smiling. And if you think this place or any other location deserves less than 4 stars, go back to McDonald's or BK because apparently you can't taste the difference and if you're really trying to save those 3 extra bucks, you probably should.

Every time I take a bite of these burgers, it reminds me of my first one ever. And for that, Five Guys, I thank you. I WILL be back. You're the reason I can't be a vegetarian. Haha! YOU ROCK!"}
{"text":"Took the wife and daughter here for lunch on a Saturday after we heard all the hype about the burgers. The burgers are good, not great, but not bad either, lets say middle of the road. I really like the bacon, it was crispy, yet not burnt. I had the Cajun fries while my wife and daughter had the regular fries. Cajun fries had great flavor, but both styles are soggy and didn't really taste done. I agree with some of the other reviews on here, NO SHAKES????? How can this be, a burger joint with no shakes? The atmosphere in this place is terrible, the tables are so close together, your practically sitting arm and arm with people you don't know. The lighting is brutal, we felt like we were under interrogation lights!! I think when I have that craving for a burger and shake, I will go the extra distance and drive out to Cheeburger Cheeburger, being we have no great burger joints out in old Henderson."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Great food and nice music to listen to while you eat.

There is hardly any waiting time and your food is hot when you get it and they never mess up your order!"}
{"text":"We went to grab a late bite , they had about maybe 15 min before close and there was a kid with glasses who took our order , another kid who was doing the filling of the burgers and a third who gave us dirty looks when we walked in, kid with the glasses took our order fine. Then a family walked in behind us, and the third kid banged his hands on the counter when he was next to the bags, and then went to the back and started cursing and the guys in the back looked through the window and said something then the third kid came back out and you could tell he was annoyed I guess he didn't realize anyone heard him. The service in Tempe is usually on point but with this being a new location I'm honestly disappointed that was unprofessional . By the time we left it was barley 9:57pm and they close at 10pm. Had more then enough time!"}
{"text":"I will never go back to a 5 guys. The food is way over priced and I personally feel sick. I'm very dissatisfied. At least the staff was nice."}
{"text":"Great place. I went there before noon and didn't have to stand in line. The place looks very clean and the burger is excellent. Could be a bit cheaper, though.

The lady on the cashier was attentive and the guys serving the burgers were in good mood and spirits. Definitely going back there soon."}
{"text":"Lets start with the positives.  The staff here is super friendly.  Everyone behind the counter is in good spirits and looks to be enjoying their time as much as possible during work hours.  They also have free peanuts upon arrival, much to the like of the Teakwoods bar establishment in the valley.  Those would be the two positives encompassing the lack of just wiping the floor with Five Guys and giving them the one star rating.

I ordered the normal burger, which is actually two patties as opposed to the little burger which is just one patty.  I added the bacon, grilled mushrooms, grilled onions lettuce, tomato, and light mayo. I made sure to ask for light mayo, because there does not need to a gallon of it on my hamburger, like most places in town like to garner.  Of course I am going to try the french fries, so an order of those went on the bill to conclude.  After a short wait, I collected my order and proceeded to survey the land. 

The hamburger is tasteless, there is no other way to say it. It is not good. Its not an opinion, this burger is just plain garbage.  Perhaps the staff could take the half gallon of salt they are putting on the fries and move a partial amount to the meat, because there is quite simply no seasoning and thus no taste. Ah yes, a nice treat, my light mayo was in fact slathered all over the top and bottom of the bun, always fun to take the mass napkins given to me to deconstruct the burger, wipe off superfluous mayo and return burger to original state. I took two bites and through the burger away, its just not good.

The fries are decent, I suppose. Maybe I was just really hungry from not eating the burger I had such high hopes to enjoy.  So much for Five Guys, total bust.

Note of review, the establishment does happen to have those cool tech soda machines that let you mix all sorts of different soft drinks together. I made a 50/50 coke zero lemon/lime mix.  

Take my advice, avoid this place and make the trek to Zinburger, you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"LOVE the burgers here & with being on Atkins I can still feel like a NORMAL person and have a burger outside of my own kitchen.  I order mine in a bowl (no bun) and it is sooooooooo good.  Sad I can't enjoy the fries - however when I used to be able to - they were friggen awesome.  A regular size order can feed 3 people - seriously.  Everytime I visit a Five Guys, folks are always nice and the place is clean & in order.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends came in one min before they close and they us bad attitude but it was our fault so no complaint. Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries...insane in calories but worth it every now and then. I live down the street and have never eaten at this location, only eaten at ones in Athens GA and New York. After reading the reviews, I want one bad but I am trying to stay healthy for till the end of the month"}
{"text":"I like 5 guys. 
The burgers are always fresh and made to order. I also love the assortment if free
Topping from mushrooms to mayo to grilled onions. 

My biggest issue is the lack of shame when it comes to grease. They toss everything, dripping into the bag. A box or better wrapping would help. 

Also, I'm not a huge fan of the fries. I know people write novellas to their glory but it escapes me. I don't know if its the peanut oil or the pepper but I just don't like it."}
{"text":"This burger joint is overrated as a mother f*cker.

Burger:
I ordered a bacon cheeseburger all the way. It was top 5 greasiest burgers I've ever eaten. I was worried for my heart after finishing. The flavor was average as was the quality of meat. Honestly, I wouldn't be able to tell between a burger patty from Burger King and Five Guys.

Fries:
I ordered the Cajun Fries. Saltiest things I've ever eaten. I couldn't finish more than half of them and let the others go to waste.

I hear people comparing this place to In-N-Out in SoCal and I just can't see it. I'd rather eat at McDonalds than eat at Five Guys. At least at McDonalds, I don't have a bag and wrapper literally dripping with grease and oil.

In-N-Out c*ck slaps Five Guys."}
{"text":"My online girlfriend Cindy who I met on a website kept telling me that you guys don't make the best burgers and she liked McDonald's the best so guess what Five Guys Cindy is now single again haha boom roasted.

Hamburgers are better than hot dogs right"}
{"text":"I like that Five Guys french fries are simply potatoes fried in peanut oil, and that their website makes it clear that they're suitable for a vegan diet. 

My vibrations change a little as I enter. Slurping on a soda and pulling food out of a brown bag, I feel no different than the average fast food user. It's a cruel world, and you have to eat, so I'm nothing but gracious that Five Guys gives me the opportunity. But I try not to do this often.

Wifi would be an improvement. I'm not sure if any Five Guys have it, so it's not a knock against this particular location.

When I ordered a drink they tried to up-sell me to a large, for 30 cents more. Nice try kid. You should be happy I didn't ask for a water cup and drink for free. There's no benefit to a larger cup when it's free refills and I'm eating there (and if I was taking it to go, I wouldn't carry a fountain soda with me).

I'm torn between 3 stars and 4. There's nothing remarkable about it relative to what I'd imagine other Five Guys locations are like, so I'm pretty comfortable calling it a 3. 

Plus, they have weird neighbors: 

When I was done eating, the grease and soda were having a party in my mouth, and I happened to have my toothbrush on me, so I brushed my teeth over to the side of the strip mall building. The MetroPCS security guard came out and was bothered that I had spit on the parking lot which could vaguely be considered in front of their store. (I mostly laughed, and it seems like a totally petty thing to worry about, but I didn't really have any problem respecting his wishes for their parking lot. One could also argue that it's a shared lot with Five Guys, so even a principled respect for whoever owns it would still mean a customer should feel free to brush their teeth there-- If I did it inside, I'd clog up the restroom for 3 minutes and someone may need it, so doing it outside seems like the conscientious move, once you get over the emotional hurdle of what you're \"supposed\" to do where.)

In a classic case of a dimwit falling head over heals for authority, some other guy piled on afterwards, \"cmon man, you know you can't be doing that\", which was especially silly since it's not even his parking lot and I had stopped at this point. \"Why?\" I lol'd. I guess the theory of when it's appropriate to spit in parking lots is very important to him, but he spinelessly slid away when I challenged him, so we'll never know.

Incidentally I had seen the security guard eating at Five Guys when I was in there. I even yielded to him when we approached the trash can at an intersecting path. I'd like to live in a world where killing sentient animals because you like the way they taste (and raping them so you can add cheese) would be more egregious than someone brushing their teeth outside.

Until then I'll use this to break the tie, to hold Five Guys a little bit responsible for the seedy area they're in, and settle on the 3-star rating."}
{"text":"I was glad to see Five Guys here after moving here from Tampa, Florida. The burgers are so good and so juicy. The fries done in peanut oil are good, too. They took me some time to get used to, but when I did -- deliciousness. 

The burgers are 100% made to order so it's not super fast food, but still a speedy meal if you don't have much time. You can even get peanuts from the counter to munch on if you really need to tide yourself over while you wait. 

As you may have noticed, there's a lot of peanut stuff happening here, so if you have an allergy, run fast and run far! This is NOT a peanut-free zone. 

Anyhow -- as with other chains: it's a chain. It's what you'd expect. Still, it's a high-ranking chain in my opinion. Just a really good burger that melts in your in your mouth in all the best ways. You're missing out if you haven't been."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have eaten here.  The cashier was friendly and had a good sense of humor and with our ordering, some good patience. I thought the burgers were tasty and the jalape√±os were fresh and had some good kick. The fries were very good. Service was reasonably fast as we had 4 burgers and they were busy. Overall, a place to visit again when able."}
{"text":"The wait time is a little long but I guess that is expected from a made to order place. Other than that everything was delicious. I ordered the Bacon Burger with mayo, grilled mushrooms, and grilled onions. It was one of the best burgers I have had that wasn't from a steakhouse. I also loved their fries, the seasoning is on point."}
{"text":"Un burger comme aimerait avoir tout le temps. Un steak gout√ª, un bacon au top, un fromage fondu √† la perfection et des frites au top. Pas au niveau de Shake Shak New York mais pas loin. Un must do!"}
{"text":"Omg.. so yummy... puts in and out to shame! Burgers are to die for! Peanut butter shake yes please!"}
{"text":"I have to say Five Guys have the best fast food burgers hands down but the five stars go to Ludwig at the shop on 7th Ave and McDowell. He was the only on one in the kitchen taking orders, cooking and bagging. He had a good rhythm going with a positive attitude. Good job."}
{"text":"I am going to keep this short and not so sweet.
First there wasn't 5 guys, there was 3 guys and a girl.  Ok my attempt at humor might have failed but so did this place in my book.
I spent 15 dollars on 2 burgers and 1 regular fry, way to much if you ask me.  
They screwed up my order, twice.
The first time I ordered a bacon burger with cheese all the free toppings minus the mushrooms, they put mushrooms on.  I sent it back and also asked them to leave off the gross, processed slop that they were trying to pass off as cheese. Also the first burger was a sloppy, soggy mess from the moment I opened the foil that it was wrapped in.
When I went back to the counter I went over my order, slowly, thinking it would be right.  Since everyone had already eaten I took it to go without checking it, another mistake on my part.  They left off the mushrooms this time but forgot the bacon.  You think they would have given my burger special attention since they screwed it up the first time, nope.
I try to stay away from chain restaurants anyway, give my money to locally owned establishments, and this experience has solidified that notion.  I will stick with Lobby's thank you."}
{"text":"I've made rookie mistakes of loading this baby up with too much liquid toppings.

Best strategy to combat a soggy bun is to go with one or two sauces and add veggies as much as possible. I love grilled onions and mushrooms offered free as well as peanuts while you wait.

This location is a bit small, especially when the second floor is closed, but it's very much appreciated."}
{"text":"I like Five Guys, burgers a bit on the expensive side but they're good. Not crazy about the fries, skins are left on and they always seem dried out. I like that you can choose from so many toppings and that there are free peanuts."}
{"text":"Been to Five Guys in Florida, and when I found out they were here, I had to try it out.
I have to say, they got it spot on.
The burgers are just as good, giving you the choice of toppings they would in the States.
The fries are fresh cut and seasoned with Cajun spice fried in sweet peanut oil.
But, the prices are steep for just a burger. There are no trio's here, so just beware.
Other than that and no poutines, this place is yummy as it is when on vacation:)
Try it out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"November Challenge - 13/30

So maybe I can't eat anything here, except for the fries. But how can I say no to fries that purportedly \"bite back?\" 

I took a friend here after picking him up from the airport. Five Guys' menu is pretty simple:  Burgers, fries. That's it, Holmes. If you want milkshakes, head over to Boogies or Peter's or Fatburger around the corner. And they only have beef burgers here, so vegetarians and vegans wanting a veggie burger; pescatarians wanting a fish sandwich that's been fried in beef tallow anyway... you are SOL at this joint. 

The fries are pretty decent, NGL. While not as crispy as I normally like my fries to be, they are fluffy on the inside and tasty. Not perplexingly chewy like the fries from Clive, so cooking them in peanut oil is not the cause. And Five Guys is just as generous with their fries as everyone says. Between me and my friend, we could not finish the regular size and I shudder to think of the person who can put away the large. They give you a 16 oz cup, fill that with fries, put the cup in a bag and then top off the bag with even more fries. The large is not necessary. What I enjoy most, is that because Five Guys only makes burgers and fries, I don't have to worry about the oil coming in to contact with chicken patties, or nuggets, etc., because they don't make those! The fries are vegan :).

While I was in the bathroom, three employees came in to change the paper towel dispenser. Go, team!"}
{"text":"My experience here was okay. Burger was just okay. The only good thing was the cajun fries!! BOMB!"}
{"text":"FIVE STARS for FIVE GUYS!!! 
Awesome customer service, they'll make your burger however you want it, although burger only well done, you can choose ANY TOPPING FOR FREEEEE :3
Best part is the selection of burgers, hot dogs, and BTW free all you can eat peanuts!! Specially if your on a budget, five guys is dedicatedly affordable and under priced for the quality of service and good they gave to us:)"}
{"text":"The burger is basically a cross between Wendy's and Burger King. It's alright, but certainly not even worthy of a comparison to Shake Shack. This is a fast food burger that tastes like fast food."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times and this time was awful! The floors were filthy, the tables were dirty and there was only one other couple inside. There were a lot of baby flies on the ketchup, yuck! We will not be back!"}
{"text":"The service was awesome!! However the food and atmosphere was not. 

It was my first time to this location. There was a line because it was a busy Saturday afternoon on Mill Ave but it went quickly! The guy that took my order was super friendly and nice and made it simple to get what I wanted! 

I ordered a cheeseburger single patty. The great thing about 5 Guys is that you can pick from so many toppings and sauces. There was a huge line waiting for orders but that also went really quick. Got my order in less than 5 mins. 

Now the cons. The burger itself was highly underwhelming. It tasted no better than McDonald's but 5x the price. 

The restaurant and dining area was a mess. The floors were very dirty and the place just felt gross. We ate on their outdoor patio and that was even more gross. The ground was littered with garbage. Even touching the doors or tables made my hands sticky. No plans on coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came with low exceptions and quickly was greeted to Queen music with fresh smell of burgers cooking. The menu seemed a bit complicated but I was met by the counter employee who was nice enough to explain to me how it worked. The place is very clean place it has an overall great taste in burgers. I would come here for  a weekend treat anytime.  Overall my exceptions were made up and coming back here very soon. Its a bit pricey so be ready to spend 12$ for burger, fries and a coke."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service. The staff was extremely friendly. Never a bad experience here."}
{"text":"The awesome thing about Five Guys is that you know exactly what you're going to get. Quality, delicious burger every single time. FG is one of the most highly rated burger places in the country year after year. 

I almost left 3 or 4 stars because we went at lunch when there was no line and ended up waiting a solid 12 minutes for our orders to come up. When you're hungry it seems like a really long time! But this is not a 'fast food' burger spot per se. I actually appreciate the freshness and made to order style so I bumped them up to the 5 stars the food deserved. 

This location also had a friendly staff and was satisfactorily clean so no issues here. Grab a burger from here if you're looking for one in the area!"}
{"text":"Makes for a perfect lazy Sunday meal, especially when you're hungover and all you end up doing is eating junk (after drinking it all night), anyways.

Their single bacon-cheeseburgers are great! If you have a bigger appetite, go for a bigger burger and I'm sure it'll still be just as satisfying. Otherwise, don't push it. Enjoy it. On the side, I had their cajun fries and found those to be really good. My friend ordered the regular and those were good too... Perfectly cut and cooked!"}
{"text":"Another cool place found through yelp ... and not just me; I bumped into fellow yelpers Daren C. and Ryan C. here at lunch. They came here because, like me, they read a review for this place posted earlier today. Because it was lunchtime, the place was busy, but the line moved quickly enough and the people taking the orders were friendly. I enjoyed the baconburger I ordered - quite a stack, with crispy bacon, two patties, plus the condiments I ordered (lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, mustard), and the fries were great - thicker than at most places, adequately salted, and a nice balance of softness and slight crispiness. Plenty of places to sit, especially since they have a nice patio for al fresco dining ... and don't forget to serve yourself with the peanuts in the shell to munch on while waiting for your number to be called."}
{"text":"Outstanding service! It's very rare to experience top-notch customer service at a fast food restaurant. Oh, and the food is delicious too!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but there was a dog IN the restaurant licking one of the tables! Guess I'll find burgers at a restaurant that cares about health code violations."}
{"text":"I went to order with my daughter and the cashier was so rude we just had to walk away. She rolled her eyes at us. When we ask what we can get she just yell and pointed to the menu above her head. We just had to walk away."}
{"text":"This one was the second five guys I've ever been to. The quality and taste were good, but I prefer the location on Lake Mead & Tenaya for cleanliness and friendliness."}
{"text":"First thing that attracted my attention when I walked in were the giant bags  of potatoes everywhere. It's a cool thing to see, but kind of makes the place looks messy, in my opinion. But, no big deal. 

I had never been there before, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. It was a pleasant surprise that their toppings were free, especially since they offer grilled mushroom and onions. I ended up ordering the regular cheeseburger. What I wasn't expecting was that i was a double cheeseburger. You think they would put that somewhere, but maybe it was my bad for not asking what their portions were like. 

All in all, it was a good experience. Did it live up to all the hype that I heard about it? No. I think it would've been better had people not told me how much they liked it. I'd probably go back - if I'm in the neighborhood. I'm still a sucker for In N out though."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers but way overpriced. I ordered the small cheese burger with a bunch of toppings. They really are messy and dripping with all kinds of sauces and juices. Tasty but all the juices make the bun soggy even though they toast it. I still much prefer burgers from In N Out but since we don't have that in Canada, had to stop here. It really does annoy me that the prices in Canada are about 30-50% higher. I also wish Five Guys would offer a much smaller size of fries. I probably will only come here once or twice a year simply because I think you get a decent burger a lot of other places for a better price."}
{"text":"The beauty of a burger is in the toppings that can make or break it.

I tend to avoid anything liquid as it create a pure an utter mess.
After always getting a small (meaning one beef patty), I got a Bacon and Cheese Regular (two beef patties). My intent was to eat one of the patties as a steak. The bacon kind of gets lost in all of the toppings, the cheese is a solid addition. 

Their cajun fries are pretty tasty,  but with a $2.55 drink, it can definitely creep up in price."}
{"text":"This was the go-to location until the one on Ste-Catherine opened up.
A bit out of context for the area but much appreciated on this area of Old Montrea/Financial District.

Burgers are pretty flavorful, but it's best to stick to the small burger as the regular is really a pricey double."}
{"text":"Thanks To Dustin the manager at Five Guys for embarrassing me I was paying with a 100 dollar bill after holding it in the air yelling we have a 100 he then advised me that they didn't take bills that size anymore. So my husband and I left if you don't take large cash bills then you should post it somewhere for the public to see next never embarrass the customer"}
{"text":"I ordered the double cheese burger with pepper jack.service was slow for a fast food  the burger was nice and juicy with plenty if flavor.  The size of fries eas overflowing for a medium .definatelyvwill go back"}
{"text":"Really good burgers. I like that I can customize my burger to have what I want on it. The fries are amazing too. It's a little expensive for pretty much a fast food place, but I'd rather pay a little more and get better tasting food."}
{"text":"It was my first time going to Five Guys and I thought the burger had a good presentation with the cheese melting onto the patty and it tasted really good and the fries I got were also good but some of it was really salty. The overall pricing was good and I would definitely go back to another location."}
{"text":"Five guys is another one of our favorite burger places. Hamburgers and delicious and never dry. They give you a ton of fries. I tried the Cajun fries and they were spicy and salty. I couldn't finish them. But the chocolate milkshake made up for them. YUM. Not diet friendly!"}
{"text":"Friendly folks and great food. Never a real long wait and very clean! I recommend always adding more vinegar to your fries because it is amazing !!"}
{"text":"These are the kind of burgers that you always want to eat. I stop by the other day just have myself one more burger before I hit the road again. There juicy but I still feel they may be overpriced. Overall place is clean and staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Lately I've eaten at many burger joints around here. .. The burgers here at Five Guys are some of the best.. I even like them better then FatBurger so far.. but its definitely upscale fast food, you pay a little more but you get better quality food..."}
{"text":"Great burger and fries. You have a choice of over 15 toppings...all free. The burger is juicy and cooked to perfection. 100 different beverage choices. Selecting your preferences is going to be a problem your first time here. Kinda pricey at $30 for a family of 3, but a good meal for an occasional visit."}
{"text":"My favourite burger joint. Be sure to get the single patty, not the double patty burger (which is the default). The double is a little too much meat-to-bread ratio. Fries are fries, nothing special, but the burgers are definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Clean, very good service, fries are more than you can eat. Kosher hot dog is excellent, even with burger being their specialty and their BLT is also excellent."}
{"text":"I am from Southern California where we have a chain called \"In N Out Burger\" - they are the definitive of hamburger purity.. and I can honestly say, Five Guys is right up there with them. Simple menu.. like IN N OUt.. (http://coreytess.com/do-you-like-it-animal-style-relax-i-am-talking-west-coast-eats/) but everything on it is perfected.

The staff is friendly, they always ask your name and yell it out when you tell them your order, which is cute..  the largest burger is insanely big, so be hungry if you order that.. and an order of fries is enough for three people! You can get them seasoned or regular. Hang out and eat some peanuts from the barrel while you wait."}
{"text":"Ive visited this place multiple times and I really encourage this joint over other fast-food chains. There is visibly a lot more care that is put into the making of the burgers and fries. Overall the burger was a bit too soggy, but the fries were the highlights of the meal. If you are looking for a fast, cheap and tasty meal then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"As long as you're clearly aware you get what you pay for you can't go wrong at Five Guys. Real ground beef cooked fresh, not processed, frozen and shipped for miles and miles. Fries cut a fried from fresh whole potatoes, not processed, frozen and shipped for miles and miles. You know what your eating! And then you taste the difference when you eat the burgers and fries. Delicious burgers!! For me after eating Five Guys I never even consider places like McDonalds and Burger King anymore. Sure Five Guys cost a few dollars more. But if you care anything at all about quality, taste and about what you are putting in your body, you definitely won't care about paying a little more. When I want a delicious burger I head straight to Five Guys!"}
{"text":"I'm struggling with this review...

Great burger. Perfectly cooked, two beefy patties and you can add lots of toppings at no extra charge (like mushrooms. Yum).

But seriously, $12 for a burger, fries and a large drink is stupidly expensive.

I devoured my burger, and couldn't finish the huge order of fries, but the entire time I was scarfing it down I kept asking myself if it was worth 12 bucks.

Not really.

But damit, it was tasty."}
{"text":"Best place for a cheap burger! Their food is amazing. There's like a dozen of toppings to choose from. All their burgers are well done but they are so juicy. They Lao have a choice of Cajun fries if you like things a bit more spicy and flavorful. Also, they have tons of milkshake flavors and you can even blend the flavors together. Also if you don't like burgers they have vegetarian options. They also have complimentary peanuts. I wouldn't go there if you have a peanut allergy because they cook everything in peanut oil. Anyways the service is quick and the staff is friendly. And the place is pretty clean!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with greasy tastiness post club hours right?

This location right on St. Catherine closes late, but I still played it slick and left the club half an hour earlier than everyone to beat the rush.

I got the double cheeseburger, and like all 5 guys, it hit the F* spot, especially at 3am.

Service was quick and the fries were perfect, zero complaints. 

Minus one star for the filthy over spilling trash can that could have been taken care of before the rush of 30 people who followed me in line."}
{"text":"Il y a longtemps que je voulais l'essayer. J'ai eu un √©t√© rempli et j'ai eu moins de temps pour essayer de nouveaux commerces, et encore moins de \"yelper\". Bref, j'√©tais fatigu√©e, affam√©e, c'√©tait le moment parfait pour faire le grand saut.

J'ai pris un bacon cheeseburger et une frite r√©guli√®re. Le principe est simple, on choisit lors de notre commande les garnitures et on re√ßoit un num√©ro. On nous appelle avec notre sac par le num√©ro attribu√©. Ca m'a co√ªt√© environ 14$ mais ouf, les portions √©taient √©normes. J'insiste. √âNORMES. Je compte y retourner mais en commandant des portions \"enfant\", et l√† encore, je ne suis pas convaincue que je vais pouvoir terminer le repas.

Sinon, excellent service, rapide. J'ai beaucoup aim√©."}
{"text":"Three stars at best. Voted best burger? Where? I only took a bite of my sons double cheeseburger and was like what? Bland at best. My 12 year old really likes this place though. Could be his taste buds are not completely developed? Well for $14.00 for a meal this won't be a regular spot. Went with the fam yesterday. 4 people I didn't eat. 49.00 what? My mother in law says to the girl, see my face? You won't be seeing it here again. Lol! Clean because it's new. Very generic fast food restaurant. Not a fan of In and Out either but I have to admit for the price it is far better."}
{"text":"Tried these guys for the first time last week and I was pretty pleased with it.  Definitely way better than In N Out!  And way better than most fast food burgers although I do enjoy Carl's Jr. a lot.  It has a nice open kitchen where you can watch them make your food, which is always pleasant.  They burger itself even though quite greasy was moist and flavorful.  I did not try the fries.  This would not be my go to spot, but if it's around and my hunger pains would be satiated by this place."}
{"text":"Love the fries, but the burger was kind of basic. It was busy when I went in, so expect a loooooong wait to get your order. Al"}
{"text":"I like Five Guys burgers.  GOOD!... I always like to get some of the peanuts to eat while waiting."}
{"text":"Had a to go order . I was reading my order from a list my sister wrote me. Cashier seemed really impatient & annoyed by me. Food was good. Place was cleaner than usual."}
{"text":"service was great, and the very smiley cook was nice....... but the burgers had absolutely no flavor!!!! I ordered a bacon and cheese double with lots of jalepeno,  tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, mustard, bbq sauce, bell pepper, and sauteed shrooms, but literally nothing tasted the way it was supposed to taste, even the fresh jalepeno had NO HEAT(even asking for xtra-xtra, I got like 6 slices)!!!! :(( the bread sucked too.... gummy, and mushy. prob wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Everyone loves In-n-Out! They are great but I'm always baffled as to why I ever go there over 5 guys after I come to 5 guys! The peanuts are a great novelty before eating the main course. The Cajun fries are some of the best I've ever had. (I don't really like In-&-Out fries). The bacon on my burger was cooked to perfection! Despite asking for almost all the extras, the 'burger master' (yes. That's what I'm calling them now.) somehow gave me a magical amount of everything I asked for. All the ingredients were super fresh! They weren't trying to hide anything (something that has happened at another burger joint before) wrong with the burger or extras. The fresh jalape√±os were such a beautiful shade of fresh green and the flavor stayed for minutes! It was wonderful! Thank you Burger Master for making my experience such an enjoyable eating experience!"}
{"text":"I think giving it a 3 might be generous, but I was hungry for a burger after a hard week of working out and eating right, so it seemed ok. Though there were many things that really make only slightly convinced I might go back. Notice, I said might. 

So walking in the place you are in a stark white with red checkered wanting-to-be burger joint. Sorry, too clean and calculated to be a real greasy spoon, but they REALLY thought they were trying. There are bags of peanuts that I'm supposing you are supposed to take, but I didn't get why I wanted peanuts when I came in for a burger. I go to the counter and am greeted by a WAY too friendly cashier who screams, \"Hi, have you been here before?\" My biggest pet peeve is being given some stupid speech just because I haven't visited an establishment, so I lied. I mean seriously, you serve burgers, hot dogs, and fries. What kind of mouth breathing moron can't figure out how to order. And when I ordered fries, he asked if I wanted regular (with description of plain with salt...duh) or Cajun. I cut him off as he tried to explain \"cajun\" as (1) I grew up in the South. Please, I know what \"cajun\" means and (2) I would probably be insulted by the fake \"cajun\" anyhow so I didn't want to hear it. 

After I place my order I go sit down to wait. There are only 2 other tables waiting for their food who were before me. As the guys behind the counter cook there is this circus act of screaming and banging still trying to make it seem \"energetic\" and \"authentic.\" I found it more stupid and annoying. I also have to note that it was cold than the dang arctic in there. I finally got my food and tucked in to enjoy. 

Little Cheeseburger - Good, but nothing so great that I would go crazy for it. It will satiate my cravings for awhile so that's good. As for \"best\" I didn't really get it. I think Amreica's palette is so destroyed by McDonald's and Applebee's that the idea of actual good food is lost. It seems like anything mediocre will excite the masses.

Fries - I got the regular fries regular sized. Good god almighty the portion was WAY overboard. He had even said that they serve two. Two what? Ogres? I felt bad throwing that much food away, especially since they don't compost =(

While I was eating I was asked 3 times if I needed anything or wanted a bag to take peanuts home. Um, once was nice, two was ok, and three was getting on my nerves. There is a point where being helpful turns to being annoying. Oh, and after roughly 700 calories in burger and fries, WHY WOULD I NEED TO TAKE PEANUTS? 

All in all I wasn't totally turned off, but I won't be running back. I'll keep up my search and hopefully find some place more local that doesn't make me want to punch the staff. I guess if you are into fast food then this is a nice change, but really, they just proved why I hate chains."}
{"text":"Going to keep this one simple, came here when they first opened and things haven't changed. People are very friendly and that's about it. This burger consistently reminds me of a Bob's Big Boy burger yet 3x the price. In and Out, Fatburger and Smashburger will continue to be better as far as taste and price, especially the meat flavor and toppings. Some people love this place from their other locations around the country, but an official meh from me for this location."}
{"text":"Good Burger, taste like a homemade burger off the grill.  Fries are good, just make sure if there is two of you to order one small fry and share, it's quite large.  Burger comes with whatever you tell them from a list of items.. Good selection and good food."}
{"text":"The burger was pretty darn good, but the fries are superb. They are fresh, cut thick (between steak fries and Belgian Fries) and are tasty, unlike In and Out's thin, greasy, flavorless fries. Oh, the soda is excellent too, perfect mixture of water and syrup.

I would go back just for the fries and soda."}
{"text":"So... let me tell you that I will always be and forever be an In-N-Out fan, my stopping by Five Guys was based solely on curiousity on why this burger joint was the favorite of President Obama. As I was driving down Val Vista last night, I happened upon seeing a five guys location, and at first thought it was closed because there weren't any cars parked by it but I saw the open signs, and had passed through the intersection so I had to flip-a- bitch to get back to the Dana Park Plaza. For a burger joint with national acclaim... you would think it would attract the same kind of traffic that one is accustomed with at In-N-Out but sadly not... although it was a Tuesday night so maybe it was an off night. 

Walked into the store and it had the similar boards of In-N-Out in the store but not the same layout... where at In-N-Out has the look of a diner with booth seats and swivel chairs and the like, here it was signs galore advertising the greatness of Five Guys it was like Five Guys glorification with all the different accolades from news publications and food critics. And it was faux wood tables and chair with high tops too. But it's the signs that get you, they're on the walls, hanging above the counters... signs, signs, and more signs. I think a little more modesty would be best but if this is how Five Guys wishes to market their brand that's their perogative... I like a clean simple look. 

Ok, so back to ordering my food. I had to ask what the difference was between a regular burger and a little burger... I was thinking patty size but was told that the regular was a double and the little was a single. I ordered a regular cheeseburger and was told that all the toppings were free in addition to, so in a way I liked that I could add all the topping without being charged an additional 50 cents but still, the price of the cheeseburger was pricey at close to $6, I also ordered a side of the regular fries. Wait wasn't long and since it was close to closing, I was able to score some additional fries. I did notice something that five guys was lacking and that was milkshakes. Milkshakes are awesome to have with a burger, and if In-N-Out and Smashburger have them why can't Five Guys have them too? But I digress. 

The meal itself. So... I remember reading one sign that said, \"best fries around...\" Tried the fries and yea... they're really good! In-N-Out fries are lacking, they're on the small side and sometimes tend to get soggy barely 20 mins later, it's the type of fry that must be consumed soon. Five guys on the other make a really good fry, it has good seasoning and a slight crisp, not too crispy, and some limp to it... it's like a medium fried fry if that exists. It was good... and if I ever come back, I'd be back for an order of fries. As for the burger, a sign said, \"A taste of heaven in a bun...\" yea... that's pushing... it's not heaven... with all my toppings of grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, pickle and bbq sauce with the double patty and the cheese it was a stuffed burger but it wasn't like OMG this burger is bomb kinda experience. Maybe I'm spoiled by the slightly toasted buns at In-N-out and my animal style cheeseburger with the thousand island... my five guys cheeseburger can't compare. It's good but not great and yes... it's filling but not worth $6! So with the cheeseburger and fries, my total came out out to $8.64. Pricey compared to In-N-Out... where a #2 (cheeseburger, fries and drink) comes out to under $3 and add in my animal style with my neopolitan shake... it still comes out to around $5. So price comparison... In-N-Out is the cheapest, burger comparison, In-N-Out again, and fries... well Five Guys wins that. Overall appeal, and crave factor... yea... it's still In-N-Out for me... I'm not yet getting off the bandwagon."}
{"text":"My burger was good. I'm used to having then bun toasted. I could eat their Cajun fries all day though!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that Five Guys is one of my FAVORITE quick burger spots in town! I mean, where else do burgers come standard with grilled mushrooms AND onions?! The \"small\" burger is really not small at all, it is loaded with ALL of the things and is extremely filling! I always get a cheeseburger ALL THE WAY and it has American cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, pickles, mayo, mustard, ketchup...and i'm probably missing something. Seriously guys, it is the bomb.com if you're a topping + sauce lover like me! I also am pretty obsessed with their hand-cut fries! They're always SO hot when you get them and they even top off the bag with a bunch of extra fries! {Pssssst: The way to my heart - EXTRA fries!} I do enjoy their Cajun fries but they're a little too seasoned for me so I think i'll stick with the regular next time. Also, their shakes are pretty fab as well - double stuffed oreo - yes way! 

Anywho, if you like A LOT of food for the same price as all of the rest, and in my opinion better quality - come to Five Guys, you won't be disappointed. This particular location is always empty when I come in so show them some extra love - we want them staying in the neighborhood!! :)"}
{"text":"Not a bad burger, but you'd think with the Zagat rating and all of the gushing reviews posted on the wall from various magazines that the burgers would be better. The burger and fries are a good size, even for the mini version, and the fries are generous but McMenamin's happy hour cheeseburger and fresh cut fries kicks the crap out of Five Guys and is cheaper to boot."}
{"text":"Wow... What a great experience. These guys make you feel welcomed and at home from the time you walk in and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Woo hoo!!! I want fat!  I want grease!  I want caaaaaaaloooories!!!

Delicious food, made to order, and they are fast."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers & fries. The grilled cheese is always a hit with my 2 1/2 year-old too! As a NOVA native, I'm so excited that there is a Five Guys close to us."}
{"text":"My son and I absolutely loved their burgers! Very juice and full of flavor. Free nuts is awesome touch. Got a shake to go for my daughter and she loved that as well."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Five Guys' food, but, MAN! The Wife and I absolutely love eating here, although we keep our visits limited since it's not the healthiest food option available (http://www.fiveguys.com/menu/nutritional-information.aspx). Then again, who actually goes to a burger joint expecting a healthy meal?

At other burger joints, I order my burgers medium-rare to ensure they don't arrive overcooked and dry, but at Five Guys, I never have to worry that my \"juicy and well done\" burger will be dry. In addition to cheese, they offer a selection of 16 toppings that can be added to your burger including bacon, grilled onions, green peppers, and jalapeno peppers. And, if burgers aren't your thing, they also offer several types of \"dogs\" and sandwiches.

Their cooked-in-100%-peanut-oil french fries are fantastic, and you can order them either Five Guys Style or Cajun Style. Oh, and they offer MALT VINEGAR to put on your friends. SCORE! A word to the wise, though: when ordering fries, order one size down from what you would order at McDonalds because Five Guys has huge portions of fries.

The food is ready quickly, the restaurant is clean, and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Looking for a big, sloppy, tasty burger? 5 guys has you covered!  All the toppings are included. The burgers are a double unless you only want a single, so prepare yourself and grab some extra napkins!

Large bags of potatos act as crowd control as well as give a clear indication that the french fries are fresh not frozen and you can taste the difference. 

Yummy!

Free peanuts while you wait! That right I said FREE! So if you got that friend that love free swag bring em along. Fill your pockets. Make peanut butter. But if you're one if those weirdos with a peanut allergy you will need an Epipen to enter the premises. 

My reviews save lives."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time @ Five Guys. Won't return. Burger good, cheese sloppy like cheese wiz. But the fries were TERRIBLE. They tasted fine at first, seemed to have some spices added. But the more I ate, the more I could taste the oil. Not exactly rancid--more of a sweet sickening taste.  Very close to how PARAFFIN tastes. Couldn't get the taste outta my mouth for 1 hr+.  Seemed to coat my tongue and roof of my mouth.  EEK!  Maybe regular customers are adapted to this peculiar variety of oil--I can't say. But 2 hrs later I could still taste it.  

I love county fair fries--the greasier the better.  But these are not them.  Not at all!

A review below compared Five Guys to IN & OUT Burger in CA.  No way!  Been there often. IN & OUT fries are shoe-string style, crispy, not greasy.  Light tasting. The burgers are thinner than Five Guys.  Not necessarily any more flavorful than Five Guys. But the add-ons (lettuce, tomatoes) are very fresh-tasting."}
{"text":"Hype, hype, hype ... $16.50 for two burgers and two waters.  You have to be kidding me.  They press the juice right out of the burgers as they make them on the grill (to make them cook quicker-but kills the flavor).  Burger King has a better product for 1/5 the price.  Very bad, unless you like getting little value for your hard earned money.  Some people in Scottsdale don't mind paying top dollar for Burger King quality food.  One star is GENEROUS."}
{"text":"On this day, at this spot, with this crew of workers I'm going to give it a rare 5 stars.  Food is same as always which usually will warrant a 3 star review from me.  But this crew here is friendly and personable.  They engage the customers and make everyone feel welcomed.  They check up on you and even share a laugh or two.  It's not to find such harmony is a fast food joint as busy as Five Guys, but they've found a way to make it work.  

Outstanding job people!!!"}
{"text":"Five guys is always getting compared to in n out. In short, if you're looking for taste go to five guys. If you're looking for value go to in n out. Five guys can get pricy but to make it worth it, you have to go all out on the toppings. The burger pattys are way thicker and tastier than in n outs and the cajun fries are plentiful. I only wish price was a little lower or I'd give five guys a clear edge over in n out."}
{"text":"When I stopped in I ordered the Little Bacon Cheeseburger  with Cajun Fries and a drink. All of which were good as well as the free peanuts. And the service was good."}
{"text":"I don't eat burgers that often but when I crave one I want a good one. I'd been hearing some buzz about this place and was in the neighborhood so I figured might as well give it a try. Walking in, they certainly set you up to expect it to be fantastic. Rave reviews from cities across the country are posted and they seem to be having fun behind the counter. Very friendly and quick service. 

The food, however, was mediocre at best. To me, more does not equate to \"better\" or even \"good.\"  Two over-cooked and dry burger patties of thin-to-medium thickness served so messy you need to eat the concoction with a fork (the soggy bottom bun made it impossible to pick up. Why it was so soggy when the burger was so dry I don't know). It was relatively flavorless and saved only by the grilled onions that are part of the \"all the way\" version.  The fries are overly greasy and soggy--not sure if they just don't let them cook long enough or what, but limp fries are not remotely enjoyable to me. Luckily the serving size is so huge you can share your calorie-laden limpness with a few friends if you so desire. (The fact that they put a couple dozen napkins in the bag to help soak up the grease should have prepared me before I even delved in.)

I can see why people who enjoy fast food might find this appealing; the topping choices alone make it better than your typical fast food joint. However, if you're looking for something more flavorful or an all-around better burger & experience, I'd say go to Fuddruckers or Create."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries at their best. Staff is great. Friendly and helpful. Been a customer since they opened. Newmarket needed a good burger joint and here it is."}
{"text":"To sum it up: Extremely underwhelming.

Service was courteous. No issues there.

The burgers were OK at best. Thin patties, WAY overcooked. Seems like decent beef, poorly prepared. Unmelted cheese slapped on top. They missed adding mustard to mine as ordered.

Fries were good, obviously real potatoes and I liked that. Coated in two pounds of salt. Had to scrape copious amounts of it off the fries to eat them. Gave up halfway through.

My wife had a coffee milkshake that was probably the best I've ever tasted.

Two cheeseburgers, one reg fries, one drink, one milkshake. $30. The food needs to justify that kind of premium pricing. Not even close. At that price, Fuddruckers is just down the street and has a vastly superior burger.

I won't be back to Five Guys unless it's a deal that can't be passed up."}
{"text":"I first saw Five Guys in Denver, Colorado back in early 2010, before then I had never even heard of it. Finally had it for the first time with my wife in St. George, UT in November of the same year. The atmosphere was really cool and the food was incredible, well this location in Las Vegas in no different, they are very consistant. Now I really hate when people try to compare Five Guys, Smashburger, Steak n' Shake, and In N' Out. They are all COMPLETLY different burger joints and should be judged on their own, independently. Five Guys burger is AMAZING. It is thick, juicy, the cheese flavor stands out, and the bacon is really thick and crispy, yum! The burger is so good, I end up taking a three, four quantity bite lol, I can't take just one! And the fries, oh the fries! They are practically endless as once you finish the cup, there is a crap-load more waiting for you inside the bag, so they basically fill your size fry cup, then pour double that inside the bag on top of everything, YES PLEASE! HAHA! I only minus one star for the prices, which to me is their one big downfall, along with not being open late (past 10pm). For one bacon double cheesebuger, fries and a soda, the total was almost $14. That's quite a bit of money if you're just out for a quick lunch or on a budget. Aside from that, this one good mother effing burger! 

P.S.-For those of you are not familure with Five Guys Burgers and Fries, a \"Little\" is a single patty, and everything without the word \"little\" is automatically a double. Now you know ;-)"}
{"text":"You can get a hamburger with all the trimmings at no extra cost. They give free peanuts! I'm not a big eater so I usually order the small.
One of my favorite places to go to get a burger."}
{"text":"I friggen love this place. SO worth waiting for 5-10 minutes while popping peanuts. (Yes, there are peanut dust and shells on the floor so if you're allergic, let someone else go in to place your order.)

Fresh jalapenos, fresh crisp lettuce, and a million* other toppings exactly how you want them (every single time) on these amazing burgers - always made-to-order - makes this place well worth the extra dollar or two over drive-through burgers.

*Disclaimer= a million toppings is more like 15. What more could you want?

PS- GET THE CAJUN FRIES AND THANK ME LATER. A \"regular\" will do; you'll end up with a half a bag full. :)"}
{"text":"This place was a recommendation from a co-worker. The establishment was nice and  very clean. 

I ordered the bacon cheese burger with everything.  It was delicious just wish that the bun was toasted because with my order having everything the bun got too mushy, still the it was a great burger, plus I got to eat free peanuts while I waited for my food."}
{"text":"I haven't been able to make it to the Five Guys location in Chicago since it opened up, so I was glad to see this place opened a store in Akron last time I visited home.

All in all, it wasn't that bad.  The burgers were greasy.  The fries are fresh cut and greasy.  They have a never-ending supply of (free!) peanuts all over the store.  An added bonus is that all of their toppings are free so be sure to load up your burgers.  The service was fairly quick but the place was hopping so I expected at least a few minutes of wait.

The only thing that confused me was the menu.  I know I could have asked for clarification on the burgers but, because the place was packed, I didn't want to be \"that customer\" that holds everyone up.  If you order a 'hamburger' or 'cheeseburger' keep in mind that it is TWO patties, not one.  Had I known this, I would have ordered the 'little hamburger' and 'little cheeseburger', which is only one patty.  I was so full after I ate my meal that I could hardly move most of the night.

I was also a little bummed out that they posted signs EVERYWHERE informing customers not to take peanuts out of the store due to \"food allergies\".  I understand the point but I could have bagged a ton of peanuts for future snacking.

A regular burger, side of small fries, and a medium drink ran me around $8.  Most of my friends think this is expensive for a burger, fries and drink but if you really think about it it's not too terribly far off from most fast food places.  I recommend stopping in - bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best Burgers in PHOENIX! Restaurant quality without the price. This place is addicting. They also serve Cajun fries which I recommend. They're not shy as far as giving you a lil but extra on the fries. Very friendly staff. 10000 stars"}
{"text":"Big reputation that was largely lived up to. A generous burger without being a contest size. The fries come out hot and fresh with the skin on which I like. Ingredients were fresh and my favorite part is the fast service. Get the order, take the cash and get the food out seems to mantra at Five Guys. A bonus is the new coke machine that allows for a veritable plethora of soft drink choices or the mistake of a Smirnoff ice.  Four stars for sure, but difficult to see how a chain could win so many best burgers nationwide."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this 5 guys and love this time. They are very friendly here staff and welcoming. Place is very clean and they are on top of cleanliness. The food is prepared perfectly. The Cajun fries are a little over seasoned to my taste but taste amazing. Overall great food, staff, and environment. I will recommend others to come as well."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life. If you are not making your burgers yourself, this is tied with Fatburger for the best burgers around but the fries sets it apart, making this the best,"}
{"text":"Came to this location for the first time this afternoon.
 I was impressed ,nice red,white, and black decor.
Food was about $20.94 ,for 2 Burgers, one fry and one drink.
We ate it there,but outside. It was a beautiful day, so good to sit outside.
They even provide Peanuts on the table so while you are waiting for your food to be cooked you can enjoy cracking peanuts and eating them.
 Bathrooms were nice and clean, as I went to wash my hands before I ate.
Place was clean, even outside.

Food was fantastic!  the bun should be toasted it would not fall apart so easily.
Free refills on drinks. Their drink machine is very different in looks, but works great!
Fries were fantastic, we were going to get 2 but, the girl working said one was enough for 2 people. It was the regular size and it was enough for 2.

We enjoyed it and will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"If youre craving some delicious, juicy burgers, this is the place to go! The burgers are so yummy and the menu is so customizable. The meat is cooked perfectly all the time I go here. You can also add an extra patty if you want! Service was normal, nothing too noteworthy, and everything comes really fast. It took less than 5 minutes waiting time for my stuff to come.

You also get free penuts while you wait which is a treat. We went on a Friday for lunch, there wasn't a lot of people. 

The only downfall would be the price. For a double bacon burger with fries and drink, your bill comes upto 20$.

There's also only one veggie option. You'd think they'd atleast have a veggie burger but they don't. They just have a grilled veggies sandwich."}
{"text":"So, I tried this for the first time. The entire experience can be summed up as follows: too expensive for what you get. 

I had a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, picked, mayo, ketchup, and mustard. a standard burger is a double patty. 

I also ordered a little cajun fries. 

And a regular soda. I drank Diet Coke. 

There are no menu combos. Everything is a la carte. 

$14 for the above. 

The burger:
tasty meat over powered by thick cut tomatoes. Delicious bun. 

the burger was good. it's a fried patty. it is tasty. 
4/5

The fries:
flavored fries sprinkled with a spicy cajun dry rub. undercooked. 
2/5

I had high hopes. the burger was good. i got full. but i didn't feel like i got my $14 worth. fries were undercooked. 

ultimately i won't return for $14.  if they had a combo for $10 it would be more cost / value worthy."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. Always busy so call ahead if ur in a rush."}
{"text":"really good food and the fries are fresh. workers pay attention and are friendly. I would visit this place again"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing burgers enough said! The guys in there are very nice...didn't care too much for the peanuts tho...I got the little cheeseburger which was huge in my opinion, $6 for just that with all the toppings, not bad :)"}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place and because I love all types of french fries, I figured I would like these, too.  Skin on fries are my favorite.  But these were just soggy.  And the cajun seasoning was surprisingly bland.  

I didn't realize that a regular cheeseburger was two patties.  So it was way too much food for me.  The bun got pretty soggy.  But I liked the burger and the unlimited toppings.  I would recommend getting the Little Hamburger or Little Cheeseburger and less toppings in order to preserve the bun.  Or just eat it with a knife and fork.

I agree with the other reviewers that the restaurant was super noisy. Not sure where the noise was coming from because it wasn't crowded. But the staff was super friendly.  The unlimited peanuts was a nice touch although the warnings all over the store about peanut allergies and not giving them to kids made it seem like it wasn't worth it for the business to offer them.

Like  most food, I guess it depends what you've grown up with. If you've grown up with In-N-Out, like me, this place may not cut it."}
{"text":"BEFORE I START MY REVIEW: This was my first time having Five Guys in Las Vegas, tried it in Miami originally and was not impressed. 

BUT...

I'm a fan, they've got me sold. When you don't have to ask for extra BACON because they only give you 2 strips = WINNING. My Little Bacon Cheeseburger was LOADED with bacon, perfectly crispy if I must add  

Now all they need to do is add a drive thru (if they do have one I didn't see it and went inside assuming they didn't and the Miami location doesn't have on either) and I will truly be THE MOST LOYAL CUSTOMER. But until they do, I'll still take my time to get out and order. The burgers are THAT good."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer and I must say I am never disappointed. They have excellent customer service and even better food. This is the best five guys location in Vegas in my opinion because of one lady named Bri. She has an amazing personality that you would love to see in everybody but that's what makes her one of a kind. Simply put, this is an amazing establishment"}
{"text":"Intended to go to Chipotle next door, but had to try Five Guys. Being a newbie, I asked the cashiers what a good first time meal is. A friend was with me, and we ended up both ordering a cheeseburger, fries and a soda each. While the fries were great, the cashiers failed to tell us the fries could have been split between three people. Burger was as good as any cooked on a flat top. While In-n-out remains this west coaster's favorite, Five Guys stays on the list for when that afternoon food coma is oh so necessary."}
{"text":"Staff was cool. Location is great. I love the soda machine ... masterpieces can be made.  :)"}
{"text":"Food is fine. They always book you for a large or extra large of everything unless you specify. They will not offer different portions. Large pet peeve of mine, buyer beware. Food is fine though."}
{"text":"Their burger is the bomb!  I always feel so healthy after eating their burger because it tastes very homemade (even though I know it's probably not very healthy lol) their fries are good too. The only thing I don't like is that they are very expensive so we only eat there maybe once a month because eating for two costs an easy $30 bucks."}
{"text":"The fries just rocked!! I think they were under staffed. There were only two gals working at the time. My cheeseburger was over cooked and dry. I know Five Guys cooks them medium well to well done and I'm ok with that. Smart thing to do with ground meat, but these patties were nearly crunchy. Not cool. Love their regular and especially Cajun fries. Probably won't go back to this location though."}
{"text":"We had a craving for Five Guys on Wednesday 7/23/2014. Since we plan a visit to Costco nearby, we revisited this Five Guys location. Our arrival was around 12:30 PM as the lunch hour rush was dying down. 

First impression of this location is it's always clean and orderly. Our orders were taken with a warning on the large fries--there would be a lot for two people--that's what we wanted! One of the things we like is the burgers have a order number on them to avoid getting the wrong one from your order. Mine was #2, clearly visible in the photo--a double bacon cheese burger that is a meal in itself!

The French fries are another matter all together. When our order was packed, another full scoop of fries were placed on top! This fries were ONLY $4.99 for the really large size and again, a meal in it self. Dinner would not take place today as our lunch will last all day and night!

The restrooms are clean with no issues. A worker does wipe the tables off on a regular basis. Any floor spills are cleaned up---all great signs of an owner who manages his restaurant above others."}
{"text":"I know this is a popular place for burgers, but I am rating the hot dogs!  The hot dogs really are divine if you're looking for a loaded dog!  They offer everything you can think of for toppings and it really hits the spot.  Their milkshakes are, of course, amazing, with lots of flavors to choose from.  They are always busy but they staff well so you don't have to wait too long for your food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After a busy shopping day at Deerfoot Meadows, we decided to give Five Guys Burgers and Fries a try and glad we did.  The burgers are freshly made to order with a vast array of toppings.  Fun environment with help yourself peanuts for you to munch on while you wait for your order.  I can't imagine anyone actually getting through a large container of fries.  They place the container into a paper bag and just start shovelling these freshly cut pieces of potato heaven into the bag.  My hubbie and I will usually share a regular serving.  Why would you even consider going somewhere else when you can get a freshly made burger with your own fixings and probably some of the best fries around.  Super yummy and glad that Five Guys is now on the Calgary burger scene."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I enjoy five guys but not tonight. This was my first time eating at this location. I ordered a cheeseburger to go with multiple toppings and when I got home to eat it there were no toppings! Not one! Just a bun, cheese and 2 patties. It clearly stated on my receipt and the receipt stapled to the bag that there should of been lettuce, ketchup, mayo, pickle and tomato. I am very disappointed  because I was looking forward to a good meal before I am unable to eat for days due to surgery. Glad I paid for a bun and 2 patties...."}
{"text":"Just ate here at Five Guys this past Friday, and it is true, the place was not even packed. I like the 1950s diner look it has to it. Ordered 2 double cheeseburgers with bacon, grilled onions, and many other toppings with large orders of fries. Fries are a bit greasy, but they are still delicious. Burgers are ok, but they have potential to get better, but ill definately be coming back for more."}
{"text":"You know i wasn't really a fan of 5 guys before, i just came here with friends who wanted to try it because it was something they couldn't get back home.  But I'm glad i got to try it again because it changed my mind.  These burgers are delicious!  I got a regular burger (comes with 2 patties), swiss cheese, mushrooms, grilled onions, grilled Jalape√±os, lettuce, tomato (can't remember which sauces).  You know what?  it was really tasty and really juicy.

I also liked their fresh cut cajun fries, i like that they give you a lot too, they fill the cup with fries, then put it in a paper bag, then add another scoop on top of it.  One order will feed 2 people for sure and if its not enough there are always free roasted peanuts.

Im not sure if I liked it this time because of this particular location or because i chose a combination of toppings on my burger that were better, but anyway I'm glad i stopped in, it changed my opinion about 5 guys, I'm now a fan!

I still wish they would have a few pre selected burger creations, say a bacon BBQ burger, a mushroom swiss burger and a cheese burger with toppings included that way there are suggestions for what combinations work.  Its just too many combinations and choices.  I'd rather just say, \"I'll have the Bacon cheese burger but with pepperjack cheese instead of the american cheese\", instead of listing each item i want one by one."}
{"text":"Although their burgers are good, they have gotten my order wrong every time I've been here, and is takes forever to get it re-made"}
{"text":"Burgers were really good, but my review is based on service.  My 8 year old son dropped his burger on the floor.  The manager came over and offered another at no charge - said he can have his employee meal for the night, no problem.  That was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh burgers made to your liking. Very awesome. Love the whole peanuts at the table thing that they do."}
{"text":"Employees could be a bit more friendly. Only my 2nd time here and didn't leave me with a great impression. First time I was here though the cashier was fantastic - very helpful and friendly - so I will give it another try."}
{"text":"It was very crowded and the line was fairly long but it did move quickly. We got two small cheeseburgers and one large fry with two regular size drinks for $20, Yikes. The burgers were ok at best,The buns fell apart  about halfway through and the fries were horrible. I can think of plenty of places with better burgers for less money.  All in all FGBF's was a big disappointment and I will not go back. Gave it two stars for the quick way they handled the line and for the peanuts."}
{"text":"Really like this place but the customer service at this location has ruined my expectations for Five Guys and can give 2 stars only. I ordered 2 burgers and 2 fries to go. One burger with mushrooms and another burger without the bun. Waited a few minutes and they called my number, I was handed one brown bag and asked is this everything, he said, \"Yes, 2 burgers and 2 fries\". I got home and only had 1 burger. I was frustrated, called and asked what happened, they said oh sorry we forgot to give you the burger without a bun. I said I couldnt come back for 30min to pick it up. Upon my return, they didnt remake the burger but gave me the one they forgot to give, it wasnt even warm. No apology or compensation, acted as if it was my fault that I didnt get it. Very bad experience, I wont return to this location and hope other locations can deliver a 5 star experience"}
{"text":"Value for your money. Hamburgers are huge and delicious. No kid menu so plan on sharing if you have little ones. I prefer to little burger fully loaded. It's no so little fully loaded. No extra charge for toppings such as grilled mushrooms or onions. The peanuts are nice little snack while waiting. The French fries are nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Super clean place.. The burgers are pretty good and fresh ingredients But the fries are even better ( huge amounts to an order. The staff is very friendly with actual personalities :) i love the complimentary peanuts in the shell while you wait. The only reason i gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is a bit pricey for a fast food burger joint.."}
{"text":"We checked out the new location on Friday. Quite a long line-up, but the food was tasty. Way too expensive for a place where you order at a counter, and take your food to the table on a tray. Two burgers and one fries was $27 so the average family sure can't take their kids in there. Being downtown, we kind of get used to the people asking for money on the street. But while we sat and ate, two people were going from table to table asking for change. So that was a bit awkward, they should have more staff around watching for this. The washrooms are \"one-person\" at a time, so not sure how they manage on a very busy day if more than one person needs the facilities. No paper towels and the toilet overflowing with toilet paper. Again, for these prices, they should be checking the washrooms regularly for any issues."}
{"text":"It's rare that we review or post a venue that we think is subpar....but seriously?  We just had to talk about this place....

So this is one of the fastest growing fast food chains in the country, and with a cult-like following comparable to In-N-Out, it has been at the top of the list for Best Burger in America.  originally from Virginia, this chain has spread across the country like a brushfire.  Having heard a lot about Five Guys, as soon as it opened in Vegas, we went to try it......

And just as a note, we have eaten here three times, all ending in the same result.  Usually I give the benefit of the doubt when it comes to food, it's not always consistent.... but in the case of Five Guys...it is...

Five Guys Burgers and Fries is, like in the title, a burger joint.  They also serve Kosher Hot Dogs, Grilled Cheese and Veggie Sandwiches.  Their only side is French Fries in two styles: Five Guys and Cajun Style. Their normal burger has two patties with the usual suspects, Cheeseburger, Bacon Burger and Bacon Cheeseburger, and if you want only one patty, put, 'Little' in front of the former categories.  They tout that everything is fresh, (meat isn't frozen) and Condiments are free, (there's fifteen of them).... And you'll need ALL of them! The Hamburger buns are eggier and sweeter than most other breads you'll find in other sandwich chains...

So you walk inside and its covered in Red and White checkered tiles with sacks of peanuts that create a queue to the cash register.  In the Southern tradition, the peanuts are free, and meant to be peeled and shelled onto the floor.....animals......

Everything is made to order so it takes a while, which is the good part.  There are no trays, everything's shoved into a brown paper sack; if you order fries, they just dump a load into the Brown bag even though they're in a cup that should contain them-needless to say, they're over portioned- one order feeds four (obesity in America running alive and well here).

Everything's fried in peanut oil, and to say they are pretty darn good is an understatement, (only get the Cajun Style if you really like them hot...cuz you're gonna burn)....

Now, being that it's primary product is Burgers, you would expect that what you're gonna get is a good, quality burger.  However, this is not the case; each time we tried the Bacon Cheeseburger we couldn't taste the burger component of the sandwich, instead, all we tasted was the condiments... Now to be totally honest, we did have the Burger, 'All The Way' which  means we had every condiment on the Burger, and the condiments itself were spectacular!!! I mean, the Cheese was excellent quality, the pickles were superb, tart and crunchy and the sauces had a tanginess that is hard to find in your run of the mill Fast Food Chain Restaurant.  But I mean, come on!  There was absolutely no taste of burger whatsoever; it was like a condiments burger with filler meat by product! What am I?  Vegetarian?  Is this Seitan? Have I slipped into a parallel Universe where Burgers are Vegan while Whole Foods serves MSG and Nitrates at their salad bars?

After the third try, I just about had it!  I was gonna get to the bottom of this mystery-what did the hell did thy do to this poor cow? Why did it have to come to it's untimely death, only to be utterly unenjoyable eat? It was upsetting me

So I decided to go back and order just a Hamburger, no condiments, no nothing just to see how the burger fared without any bells and whistles.

And as I was ordering my, 'nekkid' hamburger, the look on the face of the girl at the counter was of sheer horror,  the utter look of dread as she realized we were about to uncover the secret of Five Guys.

So when we got our Burger and tried it, our greatest fears were confirmed....  It was the worst quality meat you find; with no condiments there was nothing to mask it's unpleasant flavor.  As you can tell, it's quite lean (and dry as a used Hockey puck) there was a weak hint of unpleasant beef , but only as an undercurrent of something stronger, more rancid (ammonia)?  Pink Slime doesn't hold a candle to this piece of masticated, intestine, collagen, knuckle patty.....
But after having four burgers here, I was satisfied that it wasn't just a one time experience, it's consistently a poor product.  I don't know how they've managed to trick the rest of America, but this is not a burger joint, it's a wayward homeless shelter for unusable animal carcass parts.  Needless to say, I'd rather dumpster dive for my next meal than go back to Five Guys..

Oh yeah, we also had the Hot Dog......meh.........

Ratings (Out of Five Stars)

Food:            0.5  
Ambience:   1
Service         3  (they're nice people)"}
{"text":"Always really good here every time I've been here. It's very basic menu for the burger. Burger, burger with cheese, burger with bacon, burger with bacon and cheese...junior or regular size and that's it. Fries are great steak fries with that crispy outside and soft inside. They also come in Cajun which is a perfect amount of spice and flavor. The toppings are the only real variations you can get. There is one list that is the basics which amount to about 9, I think. Stuff like ketchup, mustard, tomato, etc. You can automatically get all of these with asking for going 'all the way'. Then there's another set of toppings that is a little more unique like a1 sauce, jalapenos, bar bq sauce, etc. That really sums it all up. They have one of those super soda dispensers that have every variation of every brand of soda, juice, non carbonated, etc. Can't really go wrong here but the only reason it's not 5 stars for its genre in my book is the burgers themselves are actually kind of pathetic. Very skimpy and I'm thinking \"where's the beef\" when I see them. They are just small and weak looking but because of everything else, it kind of makes up for it but if you are really looking for a juicy burger dripping with meat, this is not three place for that."}
{"text":"Love the burgers.  They are hot and juicy and  cooked to order.  Vegies are fresh and crunchy.  So you ask why not more than a 3 star review?  Because the fries suck.  Yes, that's right, they suck.  And they pile so many in your bag that no one in their right mind could ever eat them all.  Don't really want to dig through a pile of gross fries to get to my burger, Five Guys."}
{"text":"Have been there twice so far and am very satisfied with their burgers. The service is friendly and quick. And considering the fact that many places charge extra for the fixin's on your burger, it makes me very happy that all of their fixin's are free. And they aren't stingy with them either.

It's not a Holstein's or a Shake Shack, but for the price it's definitely a satisfying burger experience."}
{"text":"I liked this place.friendly staff, little pricey but staff make the place worth going. Thank you for the good first time experience."}
{"text":"Ordered from doordash and the food is always yummy  was surprised that the burgers have 2 patties without an extra charge. The only downside is that this place is very expensive. Would order more often if it was a little cheaper. But still very good burgers and fries. (Fianc√© and I shared 1 large fry because its huge)"}
{"text":"Not as good as I thought for that price but I got to admit, the fries were pretty good :) and the staffs were super nice with smiles on their faces :)"}
{"text":"Basic food group: Juicy burgers and fries!"}
{"text":"The burgers are fresh and delicious. An awesome amount of toppings. The seasoned fries are delicious. If your kids are hungry and can't wait for the food they have peanuts to munch on. I've literally never had a bad experience there and I have been probably 30 times since they opened. I wish I could go there more often but at $15 bucks or so for a pop, burger and fries, its kind of expensive for my McDonald's level budget. But if I'm feeling like a quality fast food burger this is awesome."}
{"text":"The burger is good. I had better but the frys are awesome!!!! Cajun frys is must have!!!"}
{"text":"Second time at five guys in my lifetime and it did not disappoint.
I was craving five guys since yesterday so i asked a few friends to go with me.
I was debating between getting the little cheeseburger or the cheeseburger. My friend told me to just get the cheeseburger and i thought okay why not.
And to my surprise i actually finished the entire burger with no problem. And it was a hugeeeee burger.
It was blessed, definitely going back again sometime.
The only thing is that its not on the cheap side, but its definitely worth it.
Five Stars for Five Guys"}
{"text":"They keep the quality high with awesome tasting burgers and fries. Is it just me or did the cup the fries come in get SMALLER?  I also they noticed they raised their prices a tad.....oh boy"}
{"text":"The best burger and Cajun fries in town!! I had the Little Bacon Cheeseburger with fresh green peppers and onion, bbq sauce as toppings. I would certainly say that their burger beat all the rest in town! Would recommend this place to anyone without any hesitation!"}
{"text":"Don't ever come here waited 30 minutes for 2 burgers and a fry. The service is atrocious here I'm sorry to say this because I love five guys but this is terrible never again"}
{"text":"This place is hella good.  What are all the other people talking about? If this place was right next to in and out I would come here 5 out of 10 times.  

But the main reason I want to give this place 5 is to compensate for all the other idiots out there giving it one star. C'mon really ? These burgers are better than almost all burger restaurants around here. 

I also want to shout out to a star reviewer that gave me a good laugh.   Person wanted \" ketchup, but no tomatoes because I'm allergic to tomatoes\". Well I know why the server rolled their eyes when you asked them to take the tomatoes off, because ketchup is made of tomatoes!!

Still confused why you get a rash everytime u have ketchup??  Do u also get water with no ice because you are allergic to ice cubes? LOL"}
{"text":"These bastards messed up my order.
I was pissed when I got home and they forgot 5 toppings. Complete BS. How incompetent do you have to be???"}
{"text":"The best burger spot. My burger is juicy and full of flavour. The spice in my Cajun fries is so yumm. Then one of the workers came around and asked everyone how they liked their burgers. Great customer service."}
{"text":"LOVE the food here. I work downtown and often go in around 1:30pm, when the lunch crowd has died down. No complaints about the food at all. Would like to see them start offering delivery like Jimmy John's does to downtown businesses. I can tell you I would order from this place a lot more often. But....TURN THAT MUSIC DOWN!!! The music is always way too loud. I should not have to yell at my lunch companion to have a conversation. Would have given 5 stars if the music wasn't causing deafness."}
{"text":"5 Guys is 3 FUN Guys!!!
The staff were all smiles and grooving to the music even though we went on Easter Sunday. All we wanted after an early brunch was a burger, fries, Poutine and hot dog. The portions were perfect for a late night quick bite. 

The location was right next tour Airbnb on Rue McGill."}
{"text":"The first time I tried 5 guys was here, downtown Phoenix! I had heard a lot about this company and their burger and fries. If you don't know what's up, this place charges a decent amount for a couple of patties because they don't charge for the toppings.

Fries are to die for, had the cajun ones and loved them. The burger was juicy and hot, and filled with all the flavors I love. The soda machine has endless possibilities for the soda nerd! I loved that, too!

The people at this location were nice and amazingly caring, even if they didn't know I had just come from the court and was a bit upset. That was a nice touch.

The only thing I wish I had was a cheaper menu, well and a little bit quieter of a radio."}
{"text":"I LOVE 5 GUYS so much that I decided this was where I was going for lunch in the Scottsdale Fashion Square. The order was quick, the cashier was friendly and seemed to really like her job. She was amazing. Also, the order was done pretty quickly despite a long line of people of waiting for their food.

But here is why they get 1 star: The greasy-faced young teenager at the end of the line decided that when he called my number, he was going to wait only 2 seconds before putting my burger in its bag back in a place away from the other food. I tried getting his attention 3 or 4 times after I approached the counter, which is farther than 2 seconds away no matter where you sit (go there and you'll see). I didn't know his name since he was facing away from me. He was getting the fries out of the fryer so I understood he didn't want to overcook and waste them, so I wasted a few more seconds before saying excuse me louder when he was not busy.

He continue to call out other numbers and ignored that at this point I was leaning on the counter with impatience. I asked if I could get my burger and he turned around and put more fries into the deep frier. Only about 5 minutes later, after being obviously upset, did another employee who was a dirty blonde male notice after coming out from the back and grabbed my bag from where the other employee put it on top of the fries heating lamp.

As I snatched it and stated I was waiting a while and tried getting the other guy's attention, he seemed confused. As I walked away he said to have a great day, and if there were not children in the space I would have flipped them off. To be honest, though, he actually made me feel taken care of in comparison to the other employee who was blatantly ignoring me.

One star for the amazing cashier and the kindness of the other gentleman, of course the food was on point but I waited entirely too long for it, and despite the fact that it was on top of the heating lamp for the fries, half the burger was cold. I'll go to other 5 Guys locations in the future."}
{"text":"I appreciate the fresh, not frozen way of doing business.
I appreciate the friendly and efficient service.

I really dig the Cajun seasoning for the Cajun fries.

That said - it's an OK burger place. Nothing spectacular, but unlike most of the big name fast food burger places - at least this tastes like food.

It's handy to have right down the street from my office - and it fills the need when I get a burger craving."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is the freshness of everything. The meat is freshly cooked (and I believe not frozen) and they even make sure their veggies are very crisp (should be standard, but you won't always find that elsewhere). There's literally a nice crunchiness when you bite into the burger. I've had the hot dog too which is actually very good. The bacon is a bit of a letdown as it's very cooked, dry and borderline bacon bits (but not in bits). Still they're very consistent (along with the one near Bramalea - just too lazy to write both), so you know what you're getting and it's pretty good quality - it just won't make you fall off of your seat like some of the promos in the store are advertising. Fries are just okay to me however."}
{"text":"Good burger and fries but way overpriced.  Could have eaten lunch at Red Lobster and saved money.  Place was clean although the setting is pretty sterile looking.  Best burger for $5?  Maybe in 2007."}
{"text":"OMFG.. I tried their burger for the first time few weeks ago when my boyfriend took me for lunch. He ordered for me since I had no clue as to how to order. I took one bite of the burger and it just melted in my mouth! My boyfriend also ordered the Cajun fries and I was kind of hesitant at first because I thought the Cajun seasoning was going to burn my mouth. Well it didn't. I had a few and it started to get spicy for me so I started dipping it in ketchup and it toned the spiciness down. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"It was my 1st time here and I absolutely loved it! I ordered the cheese burger and the Cajun fries. OMG.. I took a bite of the burger and it just melted in my mouth. It was that Delish! As for the Cajun fries, the potatoes were sooooo fresh! The seasoning wasn't over powering at all. I might go back today for dinner.. Woohoo!!!!"}
{"text":"We tried them for the first time. The service was good but the food was not as good as we expected. We did like all the topping they offer for the burgers but their fries were not crispy. They were limp and tasteless. The peanuts while you wait was a nice touch but we still prefer In & Out."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try and never gonna come back.

It was somewhat pricey for burger, fries and a malt shake - For the price i paid i prefer going to Jack in the Box across the street. In my opinion Jack has better options.

Server that took my order was rude and the place can be organize and clean a lil bit better."}
{"text":"I'm not allergic to peanuts after all!!! Woot! But okay I thought I had a nut allergy after my encounter with pistachio but turns out I was wrong, and thankfully I was able to try 5 guys finally after hearing all the raves about it. It's a typical franchise, red and white checkered pattern lines your typical burger joint. It's a order at the counter type of place with a very small menu but the toppings available for FREE make it endless. The Cajun fries are definitely to die for, their milkshakes thick and creamy, old school feel!  I didn't try a burger while I was here but I did enjoy a beefy hotdog with cheese and it was awesome. The staff was super friendly and attentive, they even walked around asking if we needed drink or fry refills. WOW FREE FRIES?! I'm in there!! Definitely lived up to the hype my ONLY issue was the seating was minimal and a lot of the tables were dirty from previous eaters."}
{"text":"Five guys are known for their tasty burgers and with the fresh made burger and your choice of a very large assortment of toppings you get exactly that.  Also, their fries are very tasty and their is a large supply of malt vinegar bottles to give the fries that extra bit of Yum.  You will also find an unlimited supply of in-the-shell peanuts for you to eat while your burger is being made which is a great way to pass the time and a nice perk of eating at 5 Guys.

This particular location has one of the new coke machines that reminds me of Coke World in Atlanta.  The machine is able to mix many flavors in one for instance, under Diet Coke you can add Vanilla, Lime, Orange, and even Raspberry I believe.  Some interesting combinations and there was definitely a group of people lining up to try small amounts of many combinations (including me!)

Overall, if you are looking for a fresh tasting burger then you can't go wrong with Five Guys."}
{"text":"This place is actually good but the only thing is that it's a bit, pricey. Don't get me wrong place is good. The burgers are awesome and the fries are so good. It's just that the prices a bit too much. If they could lower the price a bit then I'd give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"For a fast food burger joint, Five Guys is the way to go. They have the best burgers and most topping of any fast food place. There fries are out of this world good and you get the free peanuts. I love it. Sitting in there reminds me of how things were probably like in the 50s and 60s out in the country...just classic old school diner. It is fantastic."}
{"text":"Every single time I go hear the burgers are absolutely fantastic, the fries are spot on, either plain or Cajun. They cook the meat when you order not before and the wait is not that long. It's a burger like you'd like to make it home if you could and had the time. But these folks have perfected it."}
{"text":"The BEST fast food burger on the planet.  Enjoy the complimentary peanuts and the mix your own soft drinks but the star of the show is the burger with everything and jalape√±os. Wow,"}
{"text":"SERVICE: Great!

PRICE: A little much for what you're getting. A regular fountain drink, regular chunky fries, and a bacon cheeseburger came to $17.70

FRIES: A \"Little\" size is plenty for a grown man. Quality is o-kay, kinda county fair style, but I think their mandate is more about quantity for sure.

FLIES: There were a few? Never a good thing in a restaurant. 

BURGER: The patty and bread were good, but for what I was paying I was kinda surprised that the cheese was just a sea of melted Kraft Singles.

SO, OKAY: Honestly, not the worst thing ever, but I wish I'd just gone to Harvey's or cooked up a Kensington burger at home. Not sure why so many people rave about this place. Is there a secret menu something I need to know about to get the best experience?

ALSO: No recycling! What the fuck? Paper bag, napkins, and the fry container could all have been recycled. Sheesh."}
{"text":"Keep trying this place year after year to see what all the hubbub is about.  I dont care if they are rated the best in the country they are mediocre at best.  Smashburger, In and Out, and Red Robin are a much better products"}
{"text":"Great customer service. While they got my order wrong, they really tried to make it right with a smile and as quickly as possible. The ladies working this evening were fantastic. The store was clean and the food, of course was good. Stop by and enjoy some great burgers and friendly staff! Cheeseburger, fries and a cherry shake --- Yum!"}
{"text":"3.5, actually. I was quite interested when they showed up after all the hype, and the burgers are pretty good too. I'm sure they're better in the States where you can probably order them with a bit of pink, not dead all the way through.
  I have two issues: the fries are way too salty and the price is pretty steep for what you get. You could certainly make a better burger at home for less money, but you can say that about almost all of the new \"gourmet burger joints\"."}
{"text":"Since this store opened a couple of weeks ago, I've eaten there twice.  Both times the food was excellent and the service spectacular.  I've eaten at a number of 5 Guys locations and this one is maybe the best yet.  I noticed that the volume of the crew was a bit louder than other locations, but there were many more people on staff.  My guess is that it was a training thing, so I didn't let it detract from my rating.

The store manager was anxious to know if we had a good experience and really went out of her way to get feedback, which I gladly gave.

I'm a huge fan of Five Guys fries.  A trick to ensure that yours don't get soggy is to dump them into the bag your meal came in, then tear off one of the sides of the bag.  By doing this your fries can breathe and won't sweat (making them soggy), thereby staying nice and crisp .

Ordered first visit:
1 Cheeseburger all the way, no mayo.
1 Regular fry
1 regular drink

Ordered second visit:
1grilled cheese with a patty, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and bbq sauce
1 Regular fry
1 Regular drink."}
{"text":"My opinion is that the burgers are good but the French fries are so nasty I did not eat some but everything else was good"}
{"text":"Love five guys. Especially they give u a lot of fries. It is pricey. Like their little cheeseburger is $5.99 plus you need to buy the fries & drink which is separate. This location only has the regular size drink, which is $2.49 I believe. I usually go to another location where they have a little drink, which means they have 3 sizes. This place only has to regular and large. They also have hot dogs, haven't tried those yet. I wish they did have other sauces like ranch. It's pretty good, you guys should try it. Also they do have a patio outside if you want to sit."}
{"text":"There's only a few chains that still do burgers right - this is one of them. 

Expect a lineup. 

Still, your order comes fresh and hot and made just right. this place isn't skimpy on toppings and there's a decent variety. It would be five stars but they only have yellow, processed \"American\" cheese. If you order fries, you're in for a treat. These fresh cut potatoes come on two varieties - regular and spicy. And there's enough to feed all the pigeons in Parc Jarry.

Open late, perfect for when you're binging on Netflix. A meal here is worth the extra month at the gym."}
{"text":"Took the kids out for diner and wanted something different. I kept driving buy Five Guys on the Way to California Pizza Kitchen and I always wanted to try it out. So we decided to try it this evening. 
The atmosphere is fantastic. They give peanuts out for free and you can throw the shells on the floor, so the kids had a blast. The soda machine is really cool too. Like nothing I've ever seen with a huge selection of different drinks. You really have to see it. 
First off I thought it was a little expensive. 
The hamburger was a little under cooked but even so the taste was eh. I've had much better and I haven't tasted much worse. 
They give you a heaping order of fries and they tasted ok but nothing special. 
One thing that struck me was how really uninterested their employees seem to be. 
Most places are making a better effort of greeting you, asking you how things are, and saying goodbye. There is obviously no training or effort to great customers or treat them friendly in any way. 
My kids had a blast and they loved it but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm sorry the burgers here does not do it for me, neither does the fries.  Sloppy burger and soggy fries is not my preference as delicious.  In N Out still is the best fast food burger joint and it's just down the street."}
{"text":"I like to come here when I'm doing a \"low carb\" diet. (Lol!) but end up ruining it with their awesome Chips. 
They do however make any burger you want into a bowl and remove the bread, so that's my favourite thing. 
Pretty much all of their chips are to share since the serving size is so massive. 

Regular fast food chain, better than in n out, but still fast food."}
{"text":"Great service here. At first you think you are in an Inn and Out Burger, same color scheme, menu is very similar, but these burgers are a distant second. Good, flavorful and cooked to order. Juicy with \" you name it toppings\" but they can't compare to Inn and Out.

They offer free peanuts  while you wait and they actually post which ranch in Idaho the potatoes for the fries are from.  A word of caution, order the small fries, there are more than you'll ever be able to eat.

Their soda machine has over 100 sodas...seriously, not just root beer but vanilla root beer."}
{"text":"I love five guys but this particular location has disappointed me !!!!

I had a little cheeseburger and the lettuce was not fresh and crisp like it supposed to be , it's almost like they gave me wilted lettuce , ugh"}
{"text":"1st timers at 5 Guys Burgers, heard all the hype about it and had to try!

We came here about 920pm one Fri night (Royal Oak location) to share a hamburger some some fries to go. With a pop it came to around $11.

There was only one other customer inside - I think they close at 10pm.

The food is made to order which is great but be prepared to wait for your food. There was only one gal working in the open kitchen space until a manager or the like loudly prompted her to SHUT IT DOWN after we were served while reminding her that it was almost 930pm near quitting time. I guess they wanted to just get out of there but it could have been relayed more discreetly. Customers never want to feel like a burden when supporting a business.

We must have waited 20 minutes minimum for our simple burger order. 

We were prepared for a lot of fries due to the other helpful reviews, so yes, get a small, they do fill your bag right up!

The complimentary peanuts are amazing here. I swear they are soaked in a salt brine, making them deliciously addictive!

One tip - do not opt for mushrooms on the burger unless you are eating it immediately. They make the bun very soggy. 
Overall the taste was great and the fries were so good with their skins on. Hubby wanted the cajun spice but I could have done without that. They do not need it IMO, just the salt.

Love the free unlimited burger toppings (2 patties for the reg burger, 1 patty for the small) 

Great location for a burger joint and overall would recommend. Just be prepared to wait for your food."}
{"text":"Holy cow, they have the best burgers in town.  And their fries might be as good as McDonalds.  Disclaimer, i actually can't recall if I have had any burgers in Charlotte apart from five guys.

Warning for those who have never been, the regular is a ridiculously proportioned concoction, half a pound I think? And the small is 1/3 of a pound.

Also, for those of you who are in-n-out fans, I urge you to try this place.  I think the fries are better, and the burgers are definately comparable."}
{"text":"Burger protein style with grilled mushrooms and jalape√±os. Cajun fries, perfect iced tea. Good music. Friendly staff. Peanuts while you wait. Couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this burger but not the price I have to pay to eat it. Five Guys is a great franchise, but I wonder where the breaking point is in their pricing. Sure, it's a gourmet hamburger and I can appreciate that over a Big Mac, but its almost $20 to eat at this fast food restaurant. The food is excellent, the service is first class and the management is very friendly to the patrons. I've collected almost 50 Five Guys menus from all across the country so I know what everyone else is charging and how they manage all those stores. I know i'll get a good burger when I visit one. I'm just not sure how long I can afford it though."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try a Five Guys for a really long time. My experience was that it's less greasy than everyone kept saying, which was a good thing. The burger was really well done. Such fresh toppings and such a variety to choose from. We got a small order of the cajun fries and it was perfect for two people. They were just ok. I would get regular fries or something else as a side next time. There was a guy working the register and various other tasks who was really helpful with our ordering and a real cheerful fellow."}
{"text":"After Moving here from LA This is the only place I've found that kills the Cravings. Montreal isn't a Hamburger town but this US transport fits the bill. It's not In-n-Out but a close second."}
{"text":"Mmmm...

Best burgers and the cajun fries....wow!"}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I stopped in for lunch, for the very first time, on our way out of town to Las Vegas.  In my opinion, it is a must try for great customer service and food.

The food was wholesome great portions, delicious hamburgers, fries, and friendly workers.

Keep up the great customer service and food prep everyone!"}
{"text":"I would like to update my review after management reached out to me.  Tonight I decided to give this location another try and boy I'm glad that I did. Edwin, the manager on duty listened to the situation that happened on my prior visit and didn't hesitate to take charge and comp our order. The entire meal was excellent and was definitely worthy of being a Five Guys Burger and that says a lot.  I understand that as a new restaurant opening there are going to be bumps in the road and while this location is going through some bumps, they will make sure that you leave as a satisfied customer and that's what matters most."}
{"text":"I went and ordered a little cheeseburger urger and a Cajun fry and the young lady who took my order kimmie was very sweet thru the whole process and made it a very great visit! She Even complimented my shirt! Very nice place I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I've come in here a couple of time after visiting a salon nearby to chow down.  I LOVE their cajun fries and how they load up your bag with more fries than what the fry cup holds.
Their burgers are always very juicy and delicious.  I'm a slow eater (and I get so consumed by the fries) that by the time I get to the end of my burger, the hamburger buns are completely soaked through with all the juice.  I'm not a fan of having to hold the burger when it's a big soggy, but boy does it taste good!
There is a bit of a wait there but I can only assume it's because they cook EVERYTHING fresh.  So be prepared to stick around for a bit while waiting for your food.  What's nice is that they have a huge supply of peanuts that you can snack on while waiting for your order.  Although I'd hold off on eating too many peanuts, as you'll want to save your appetite for the real food!"}
{"text":"Little bacon burger very tasty. Fresh jalapeno gave it a nice flavor and bite. Well done"}
{"text":"Every time I go here I am never disappointed. They are almost always busy and even then the wait time is still reasonable. I usually get their normal Cheeseburger (which is actually a double meat and cheese burger) and a normal french fries (which actually is scooped into a reasonably sized cup and then they add an extra scoop of fries to pour into your bag). The portions are huge here and I think is worth the price. The flavor of the burgers are incredible. Only warning is to not overload your burger! If you do, intend to eat in. Otherwise if you take it home, by the time you get there and go to eat it, it will be soggy. Fries add to sogginess if left bagged after awhile but the flavor is still there and portions should last you awhile. Never had a better burger than Five Guys burgers!"}
{"text":"Hey i just grabbed this to go.  YUCK, the grease from the fries is soaking the bag and i find that disturbing and a bit gross.  As for the burger, its dry.  If you are going to charge a premium price you better make sure i get a premium burger.  And FYI a smile would not kill ya.  Dont just tell me my order is ready and push a bag towards me.  Remember, us consumers can eat anywhere we want, we dont have to come back to you, and I'm pretty sure i wont come back to this location.  I just happened to be there around lunch time and was disappointed with the quality of food and service.  There are pletnty of options within a 5 minute drive so i suggest that people explore those options.  There burgers were nothing special to begin with, but today was the day they really dropped the ball with their quality."}
{"text":"I don't dogg no burger place but five guys is good but the wife likes it more then me but it's good no complaints other then if you get to many toppings then your burger can taste ok or awful lol"}
{"text":"Great burgers, the Coca~Cola Freestyle machine might be reason enough for now, but the real star s are the nice people like Katherine C that are so courteous and really know how to make GREAT fries.

We'll keep coming back and asking to make America's Fries Great again :)"}
{"text":"Their Cajun fries are amazing! And their burgers are huge.  Yum!! I recommend the small size burgers unless you want a monster! Well to me anyway. The staff here provides excellent service too!!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers with good fries. I live right next to this five guys and I go there everyday for lunch and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Love five guys! If ur looking for a really good and fresh burger this is the place! 

They make everything fresh! 

I always order the little cheeseburger and a small fry. A regular cheeseburger is just to big for me. Also I love how they give you extra fries! 

They also serve hotdogs. 

You get to choose what toppings you want on your burger! I usually get lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, pickles, grilled onions, ketchup & mustard. So delicious. I wish they had ranch. 

They have a soda machine with so many flavors! Also they have free peanuts."}
{"text":"I left 5 guys with one thought on my mind....BRUH!!! got the double cheese burger with the spicy fries (MMMMM....miss them already)....talk about a Trex of a burger....thing was huge and ferocious...the meat was of really tender good quality ....loved it...they have tons of toppings...and the staff is wonderful...just dont go if you have a peanut allergy...i think everything they use has to do with peanuts...haha...i always laugh when i say that word...nvm!! ,,but yaay...5 GUYS for the win!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for burgers. The freshest of all ingredients. They make burgers right in front of you on the grill and you can pick your own toppings. Just beef burgers, comes in regular size with two patties or little size with one patty. Choice of regular or loaded fries, and hot dogs. Service is quite fast and staff is good. And best of all, you get free peanuts."}
{"text":"I've been coming here a couple more times than I thought would have and I am slowly starting to understand the attraction to this place. The burgers are not too bad. Actually I would give it a little better than above average rating. Like a 3 star.

They have been pulling back on the amount of fries you get in a bag but you still have to share them."}
{"text":"Just a note: The fries are fried with peanut oil and there are self serve peanuts in a box in line, so maybe not the best place for people with peanut allergies.

I have heard so much good things about this place from friends and I don't why I kept avoiding this place. But finally decided to try one of these bad boys out.

Order your burger at the cashier with toppings of your choice (I would recommend getting cheese but that how I like my burgers). The burger is always double patties so if you want just one patty, you should let them know. If you order a side of fries, be prepared for one of the freshly cut, tastiest, and bountiful amount of fries. Take your receipt with a number on it and they will call your number when your order is ready. Take your cup and get your drink at a fountain dispenser. Pick up some peanuts and find a seat while you wait for your order.

When they call out your number you'll get your order in a brown paper bag. If you got fries, you will have to fish to the bottom of the bag for your burger. Yes there is a lot of fries and would recommend you share if you're with a friend - or not and keep them to yourself.

I've tried them and I keep coming back for more. The burgers are a bit pricey but is one of better burger joints in town."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a burger this evening and decided to try out the Five Guys close by.  It has been a while since I've eaten here since my previous experience (over a year ago) didn't yield any lasting memories.  I walked in at around 6pm on a Sunday evening.  The restaurant was clean and I approached the counter.  This place has a limited menu with burgers, hot dogs and fries along with their varieties.  I ordered a cheeseburger \"all the way\" and a hot dog with cheese and onions and a medium order of fries.  The cashier informed me that they \"ran out of\" hot dog buns and if I would mind my hot dog served on a hamburger bun.  I found that a bit odd that a place where hot dogs are one of two menu items that they would run out of buns, but I went ahead and ordered the altered dog.

When I received my order, I dove in to my burger.  Unfortunately, the bottom bun was soggy due to the grease from the burger.  This certainly makes the entire meal a bit unappetizing.  Aside from that, the burger was ok - nothing special but certainly not bad.  The soggy bun really turned me off.  The hot dog was sliced in half and arranged in a hamburger bun.  The dog was Hebrew National and, as expected, was tasty; however, the hamburger bun did not do it justice.  Lastly, the fries, while freshly spliced were good but the quantity was a bit much.

Lastly, given the average taste (and the soggy bun), the price of the meal was a bit on the pricey side.  I would recommend In-N-Out nearby for a fresh burger and fresh-cut potato fries - delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Quick and tasty - the burgers come with a wide variety of topping options.
Get the Cajun fries - that's the best.
Lime Coke available here as well.  :-)
A step above the usual fast food joint, so + 1 star."}
{"text":"This was my first and only Five Guys experience, so this review is just based on this specific location.

My whole family went on a Sunday afternoon, and it wasn't super busy, but there were quite a few people there. Our food came out pretty fast, but half of our burgers were wrong. 

The place was clean and up-kept, I'm mostly disappointed by the food. 

I didn't think the taste was worth the pretty penny, or the portion. It wasn't awful, I just wasn't impressed and I wouldn't think of this place to suggest to anyone."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service from the Cashier, Angelika W, was very short, un enthusiastic, and made me feel like I was inconveniencing her.

Will not be coming to this location again, and recommend nobody else does as well."}
{"text":"I was feeling a little peckish after a vegan meal.... so what better place to get an afternoon snack than a burger joint, right? Who's with me?  To be fair, I don't eat red meat so I only ordered their Cajun fries. I quite enjoyed these - they were fresh and crispy and DAMN they were HOT! The guy warned me but you know, I thought they were 'light' (that's what he said - \"light Cajun). That boy lied, but my stuffy nose is now cleared up thanks to these fries. My only 'negative' comment would be that they weren't very salty. I would've liked a more balanced blend of salt vs. spice. 

Fast service, portions are good."}
{"text":"This is my first experience with Five Guys Burgers. Coming from the Bay Area where I reside, I have a location that's about a 15 min drive. I would always drive by and never bothered to drop in. I just been hearing too many mixed reviews about this place back home. I just had to try it for myself.

When I stepped in the restaurant, it was packed and busy. It was a pretty BUSY weekend. The line was moving at a decent rate. Basically the concept I got from this place is Build-It-Yourself Burger or Hot Dog. That was interesting to me. When I got to the counter to order, I decided to go with the cheeseburger with \"The Works\" toppings. This included a bountiful amount of toppings (Mayo, Grilled Onions, Lettuce, Tomato, Ketchup, etc.) I also added in some jalapenos. With the burger ordered, I ordered a side of Cajun fries.

When I got my order, I knew it was not going to be a healthy meal. You can see grease soak through the paper bag. Since the restaurant was packed and no seats available, I took my order to go and brought it back to my hotel. Once I got to my hotel, I got straight to business. The burger tasted very good. Next time I got to lay off the multiple additions of condiments since it kinda killed the burger's true flavor. As for the Cajun fries, OMG they were pretty good. I think they would have been better if they were crispier.

The experience of the burger was OK. I'll possibly try this place out again in the West Coast if I have the urge to build my burger. Better yet I'll throw a BBQ!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here! They are fast and always get my order right. The peanuts are an awesome addition to a trip here."}
{"text":"Eh, I really didn't see what the big hype was all about. 

For some odd reason when I saw the name I thought there would be some hot guys working here.. thus there were not

Cons;

1. The line was super long. I only like waiting in line if it's a sit down place or less than ten mins. We waited about 15 minutes. No thank you. 

2. The fries were ridiculously large and came out soggy. I would rather have 1/4 of the amount of fries and have them crispy/crunchy,

3. The tables weren't clean. We had to go grab napkins and wipe off our table. That's just a huge pet peeve of mine because I used to work in fast food in high school, and in college a manager at a fatburger. It really isn't too hard to wipe down tables and keep up the cleanliness. 

Pro;

1. Not badly priced. More expensive than In N Out and personally i like In N Out better. 

2. The burgers were tasty, Not delicious, but good enough to come back.

Overall my experience was medicore. Maybe I caught them on a bad saturday so i will come back again."}
{"text":"It was pretty pricey but they have free refills on fries, on top of that they have complimentary peanuts, everything is sold separate no deals , unlimited condiments their \" small burgers \" are like. Regular cheeseburger you would get from mc Donald's but it will have you full . Overall it made me filled up ."}
{"text":"First of all, I haven't been to a restaurant or any food spot that served free peanuts (other than a bar). I think thats pretty cool of them. I was thinking of taking some home and making some homemade peanut butter..hehe

I got the hamburger with everything on it (mushrooms, ketchup, onions, pickles, mustard, etc). When we got our order, I noticed the they packaged everything in a brown bag which is a good and bad thing. Its good bc it drains some of the oil from the fries but then again who would want to hold a greasy bag. The burger was very flavorful and medium sized. It reminded me of a burger that I would cook at home on the Fourth of July.

If you're the type that likes to have a lot of ingredients and flavors with your burgers, then Five Guys is the burger place to go."}
{"text":"Been to this Five Guys three times now and have not been disappointed. I've been to a few others around the valley with mostly positive results. 

Today I ordered a single bacon cheeseburger with various toppings and a lettuce burger with limited toppings, plus fries on the side.

The burgers are cooked fresh to order and are about 1/4 pound. The bread for the buns is always fresh, as are the crisp toppings. They offer a good assortment of condiments, such as A1, ketchup, hot sauce and such, along with the usual suspects like lettuce, onions and pickles. 

The fries are always plentiful here, as you get a double order each time. They fill the container and then give you that much more in the bag. You have to get a go-box to take it home or you get grease on your car seat. The seasonings are always on point tho. Plus they offer malt vinegar."}
{"text":"I love coming here for a good quality tasting burger and fresh cut fries. It's priced very well compared to other fast food burger places & all the employees here are very friendly. Don't forget to grab a handful of peanuts while you wait for your food!"}
{"text":"This is the best 5 guys in town. My 7 year old daughter and I are regulars and this location. This time they let her ring up our order on the register. She loved it! She also screamed out 4 patties in front of everyone. I haven't seen her smile so big in a long time. Thank you to the staff and manager."}
{"text":"over priced and over rated, I've had better.  
It was OK but i couldn't care less if i return here or not."}
{"text":"The only burger that gives In n Out a run for its money. 


The Cajun fries are amazing and they give you so much!

Free peanuts too! Why are you still reading and not on your way there?"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's a great burger place. Period.
Always get the bacon cheeseburger, fries that are to die for, and I love having the option of picking what you want on the burger. Worth the trip everytime."}
{"text":"I loved the cheeseburger!! And didn't have any of the lousy experiences the other yelpers had. No smoke, really nice servers, and hot, non-greasy burgers. 

We've had our share of lousy over-priced burgers but we all agreed that the burgers here were really good. The lovely's sister was in town and she's a fan of the fries [she has them in Denver...] I wanted a cheeseburger after the fabulous Christmas show extravaganza down the street and was not disappointed. Two patties, cheese and ketchup - juicy n tasty.  De freakin lish. Hot fresh and yum. The lovely had more 'decorations' on his and enjoyed it along with the other half of mine. 

And while I'll go out of my way for a cheeseburger, will not for fries. The sis thinks these are the bomb. I was meh. They're freshly cut and hot, not overly salted - fine. And good lawd enough to feed a family of four!! 

Pricey but better than In and Out or Smashburger. By. Far. Would not hesitate to return. I will - because of Stephen B's  August rant -  go try Delux :)"}
{"text":"After a month long trip to Asia, work buddies decide to take me out to Five Guys for a burger.  You'd figure after not having a hunka-slab-o-beef for a while that this would be the best thing since.. sliced hamburger patties.

Well.. it was ok.  However, over the years, I've learned that 100% pure beef of one cut will only be so good.  The best burgers in the world are blended burgers.  Some kind of cheap cut along with some fatty ones 
like short ribs, and/or some additional gamey like meat (i.e. lamb).  

5 guys fries were above average and loved the Cajun spice on my fries.  But the burger itself no better/worse than a Johnny's burger or a Burger hut, albeit a bit more pricey.  That alone will keep me going back to the mom and pop shops.

Hmm I think I'll start my own chain.  2 Chicks with meat and a cup?  




nah.."}
{"text":"Love the burgers, hate the price! $9.00 for a cheese burger and drink, cannot afford the fries. The fries are too large to order if you want just a single serving. I would eat here more often if the prices and portions were more reasonable."}
{"text":"Love Five Guys.  The burgers are awesome.  The service was friendly here.  The homeless guy sitting around the corner asking for change was a turn off, but that is not their fault.  Most of the tables were dirty and peanut shells all over the floor."}
{"text":"grabbed an order to go tonight.  Music was at a much more acceptable level.  Customer service was outstanding.  Hands down one of the best burgers out there!!  I do not mind the price."}
{"text":"A quick efficient cost effective burger meal with a mix pop machine. All kinds of FREE toppings for your patty and make your own drink. Great fries and yes FREE shelled peanuts. A great burger meal at a good price. You should go home with a full belly and a good pop fix."}
{"text":"Rockin bacon cheeseburger, unlimited fries & peanuts!     Love the black line toppings!"}
{"text":"Probably the best burger place in Surprise that's full service restaurant.  Always clean and inviting.  We've always been greeted as soon as we come in, customer service friendly, easy ordering, good menu options, good value for your money.  Food is delivered hot and nothing is left on your plate."}
{"text":"Took the family for some burgers and fries after the first day of moving.  We were starving!  Ordering was easy and per the receipt, everything was ordered correctly.  We didn't have to wait long.  We got our food and started to dig in, and my husbands burger was all wrong.  He asked for a little bacon cheeseburger all the way except tomatoes and ketchup.  The receipt also reflected this.  It was a regular cheeseburger with ketchup and tomatoes, no bacon.  So he took the burger back to the register and told the girl.  It wasn't her fault.  She put the order in correctly.  A young man came up, I assume the manager on duty, and he was very friendly.  Offered to remake it.  He shouted to the back, \"little bacon cheese burger all the way no ketchup no tomatoes on the double!\"  It didn't take long and a new burger was out.  Husband bit into it and no bacon.  He gave up on it and just ate the burger.  We wanted more fries because a large is not enough for a hungry family of 5, so when he went to order the fries, after he paid, the manager was standing nearby and he told him what happened.  He said, \"not a big deal but thought you should know, they still didn't make it right.\"  Immediately the young man offered to compensate him for the burger.  My husband said it wasn't necessary he just wanted him to know but the young man insisted, so he refunded the burger.  While doing so a girl from the back commented that she remade the burger correctly, and had a snarky attitude about it while rolling her eyes.  So I stepped in and commented, \"no you didn't, you forgot the bacon\" and she puffed off.  Didn't care for her vibe but the manager handled it right, good customer service, and turned a 1-2 star review into a 4.  Maybe next time a 5 if they don't forget the bacon, twice."}
{"text":"So after getting turned down for service because they aren't open till 11:00am I double check the hours for this business on Yep!
So I see it says 11:00am till 10:00pm!
But that is what it said two weeks ago the last time I was there and I told the manager some women at the time and she told me that it was wrong they open at 10:00am!
So today go there they have the hours posted on the door but the front door is unlocked I walk in get some peanuts go to order and some guy comes from the back and says sorry they don't open till 11:00am and it's only 10:30am and he is the manger!
So what the story who runs and decide the hours and who manages the store!!"}
{"text":"Service is fast. I ordered a cheeseburger w/ grilled mushrooms, mayo, and ketchup, large fries, and a large drink. Food is fresh and really delish. I know it's just a burger but it's really cut above the rest for the price. Free peanuts in shell if you like. The place is clean. Perfect for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious and as juicy as it can  be! We ordered a regular drink (free refills), one regular hamburger (double patties), one regular bacon cheeseburger (double patties) and a regular cajun fries. 

The regular hamburger had jalapeno, mushrooms, onions, A1 sauce, lettuce, and mayo. The bacon cheeseburger had mushrooms, bbq, A1 sauce, lettuce, mayo, relish, and onions. The regular cajun fries was incredibly large and delicious - they were crunchy and soft in the inside. 

Pretty hard to deny this but one of the best part was the wait. The wait consisted of a worker handing us a bowl full of peanuts and making small talks as she was cleaning tables. It made us feel at home and welcomed!

All in all, High Five to Five Guys! Two Thumbs Up! Will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Really clean place to eat! I highly recommend it. Their burgers are big, fresh, and delicious. The fries were my personal favorite and I'm really picky about my fries ! They have a great selection of drinks to pick through to complete your meal!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but had to wait 10 min. on a small fry, even though the store was empty"}
{"text":"Five Guys... What cannot be said about this place?  I stumbled upon it last October in Saratoga Springs, NY, where we decided to eat at Chipotle for lack of anything else recognizable.  I saw the Five Guys next door, and decided to try it out instead of having another bland Chipotle burrito.  Needless to say, when I ran into another Five Guys in Ithaca two days later, I knew I had to eat there for lunch.

Since they opened here in the Valley a month or so ago, I've had to restrain myself.  If it weren't for the guaranteed heart attack that would occur were I to dine at Five Guys twice a day, I think I would probably do so.  

I should point out that, before I ate at Five Guys, In-N-Out was my favorite fast food burger joint.  But the food at Five Guys is simply superior.  The burgers are tastier and have more options, and the fries are an order of magnitude better.  

The only issue I have with this place is that the price is admittedly steep, but when you consider how much food you get, it's not too unreasonable.  If you stick to the Little Hamburger, which is still probably more filling than a normal fast food burger, you could probably get a meal for inside $8, but that meal will still be more substantial than a normal $6 fast food burger meal.  On the upside, however, the price might have the fortunate side effect of discouraging rowdy kids who could care less about the quality of their burger."}
{"text":"Go to in and out. It's across the street, cheaper and tastes WAY better. They don't have combos and the burger alone is 6 bucks. It's good, but I could recreate it at home. The fries - yuck! Very plain. Save your money!"}
{"text":"Free peanuts...Really big portions..slightly pricey...a large fry might be $5 but you will get a bag of fries...food is healther cooked in peanut oil.  If alergic to peanuts do not enter the place..."}
{"text":"After reading many reviews for places to eat in Tempe, I decided I wanted a burger. Chose Five Guys because of a friend of a friend  raving over it. 

Walked in and read the 30 signs they had all around the place then finally made my way to order. I ordered a cheeseburger with onion, lettuce, and mustard. My partner ordered a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, ketchup,and mustard. We each had a drink and shared a small Cajun fry.
We asked the cashier how big each patty was and he said 3.3 to 3.5oz's. 
Food was quick. Fries were small but plentiful, actually, we only ate the the extras at the bottom of the bag. The cup was still full. Anyways I started on my burger and found it to be okay. It was good but that's it. The burger was juicy but not flavorful, I am glad that I added the cheese which made it a little better. I really didn't like the seasoned fries, they were better when I dipped them in hot sauce.
My partners burger was of course messy but the bacon was good, crunchy and had a smokey flavor. It was good, definitely better than mine but nothing I would crave. Overall, I wasn't blown especially being on Mill, closing at 7 and being overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is a really established brand in the USA, and it was fantastic here. They overload you on fries, and unlimited peanuts. I love peanuts. 

In terms of the burger, it had a Harveys feeling to it. You could get whatever toppings you like, and it was cooked right in front of you. The burgers were great, and juicy, and it wasn't too big. The problem is that it was a little bit pricey for a burger. They don't have combos, but if you order one large fries, it can cover 3 people easily. 

With all burger places, you can smell the grease. It was your typical burger joint in that aspect. 

Overall, I will be going back again."}
{"text":"First time at this Five Guys. Didn't even know it was here, tucked in the NE corner of Baseline and 24th St. I hadn't been to 5 Guys in years so I was excited to see this store. 

Ordered 4 burgers and 3 fries on a Sunday. The online ordering  was clear, easy and fast. I arrived right on time and the burgers were ready but they said they didn't want to fire the fries until I arrived. Maybe a pain to some but it was a good call. They stayed hot and crispy during the drive home. 

The burgers were all done exactly as ordered and were as good as I'd remembered. BTW, I recommend trying the malt vinegar on your fries if you haven't tried it. Takes it up a full notch."}
{"text":"Good burger today. Ordered a small burger with bacon and cheese plus the free condiments, like Frank's Hot Sauce and sliced jalape√±os. My wife has gluten issues, so we ordered a lettuce wrap for her, with pickles, tomatoes and spreads. 
They forgot her tomatoes. When you don't get much on your burger, you want want you order. 

Fries are always good at 5 Guys."}
{"text":"It's 5 guys.  You know, yummy delicious amounts of meat, cheese and toppings.  Great fries, big portion.

This location didn't disappoint.  The people working were friendly and seemed to enjoy being there.  

Not much of a line.  So ordering was quick and the food was freshly cooked and ready.  

As with most burger places, you can expect a burger, fries and a soda for $10+."}
{"text":"Time for one great cheeseburger. Face it - this is comfort food - not diet food  For a once a month treat a cheeseburger and a milkshake can't be beat.  Of all the new hamburger chains I feel that Five Guys delivers the best product time after time
When I have someone to share and order of their fries are yummy special. 
My plan - eat less but eat the best 

Happy New Year ya'll."}
{"text":"Always one of the best cheeseburgers available
The milk shakes are not shabby either. Good for a once-a-month treat"}
{"text":"How is it I've lived so long without trying this place. I try to avoid fast food, but sometime you just gotta have it. I had the \"little\" cheeseburger & an order of fries.  I thought \"little\" meant child's size but found out it just meant one beef patty not two. The order of fries was huge. Could easily share with two people which I will do next time. Hamburger was very fresh and juicy. I think Five Guys follows the In and Out model of made on premises, but I prefer Five Guys. The portions are more generous. It's a cheeseburger for adults. I'm giving it four stars not five because it's hard for me to give a chain of any kind five stars.  It just doesn't seem right.  However, for what it is, it's best in class"}
{"text":"never been to a five guys that i didn't love.. this one is no different."}
{"text":"We all might have our favorite \"fast casual\" burger places but there is no denying Five Guys hits the spot. Love the seemingly unlimited choice soda machines too. The only negatives are that it doesn't quite have that home grilled taste and that if you're bringing your family to eat the music is let's be honest way too loud. Loud enough it makes me eat faster just to have a little quiet."}
{"text":"I've been to this 5 guys twice now. Its good. I like it. Santa and Mrs. Clause came in the most recent time I stopped by (December--obviously quite a long time ago). The kitchen staff are fun and loud. They are also very accommodating if you want to change something or made a mistake on your order. Also, sitting out front in the summer time is a good spot to veg out with burger, fries and vinegar."}
{"text":"My hubby loves this place and would give a 5 star. I don't and would give it 3, although I do appreciate they're custom made to order. Fries are greasy and not my thing. Burgers are just average. My husband says the key is to let your burger sit in the wrapped aluminum for a couple minutes so everything gets steamy, cheese melts and bun softens. That would probably help. Yes there's free peanuts but I don't love peanuts so that doesn't add anything for me.  Hot dogs are a nice option."}
{"text":"So it's been awhile since I've eaten at Five Guys. The first time I tried them was in Tucson, AZ, and it was pretty good. Hadn't eaten there for awhile and, as we were up in Phoenix and missed lunch, we decided to stop in for a mid-afternoon lunch/dinner. 

First: Wow! Did the prices ever go up! 7.99 for a regular double cheeseburger, 8.99 with bacon. Ok, so I'm super hungry, might as well try the one with bacon. To this double cheeseburger, I added grilled mushrooms. My hubby tried more add-ons: grilled onions, pickle, ketchup. 

Second: it's mid-afternoon, what is taking so long for this order? After finally receiving it, we realized there must be a shift change in progress. (There were many younger women excitedly talking behind the counter to each other, virtually ignoring the customers. Their noise level was actually much louder than the customers'..) Orders are placed in a paper bag (!) even when eating \"in.\" The bag had both burgers placed on the bottom with fries thrown over the top! We headed out onto the patio for some fresh air, where I discovered my burger was fresh, but the bacon was placed on the bottom, along with the grilled mushrooms and the cheese was melted between the two patties. Maybe I'm a stickler for detail, but I do think it changes the taste when the cheese isn't on top and the bacon on top of the cheese! Hubby's did not have grilled onions as ordered, merely chopped raw onions, which he really doesn't like. 

A  previous reviewer's assessment that \"No manager to supervise a disorganized crew,'' is right on. The lack of really good customer service, along with wrong order fulfillment leads me to think that next time I will go to a competitor who charges less, either one that is truly fast food or one that charges less and actually serves the food to the table. Either would be better than this."}
{"text":"I love 5 Guys the free peanuts keep your stomach at bay and the Peach flavored Mello Yello is a hit with me, I love those Multi-selection soda fountains"}
{"text":"Like the Burgers, Fries, Multi-slect soda machine - Peach Mango Mello yello is pretty cool..."}
{"text":"I live on a strict budget.  Once every few months I allow myself a burger from Five Guys.  When I went in last week to get a burger, I was greeted with higher prices.  Due to the higher prices, I had to leave without getting a burger.  I guess I will have to find another \"treat\" in my budget."}
{"text":"We eat here every other weekend. And the food is the kind of food you will dream about. Its something about the burgers here. Can you say Oh my GOD Good! I will stand in line for days for this burger. Its got that BBQ taste its always fresh and hot. The staff are the best they are quick and professional. Sometimes they sing ok maybe they chant or something. But one thing is for sure they have the BEST burger in the business. I don't recall a burger better than them. This is the supreme comfort food once you eat here you will find out just why the food is so irresistible!"}
{"text":"I called to make an order for pick up at 9:45, I had forgotten that Five Guys closes at 10, but when I called instead of being told that, I was placed on hold for 13 minutes and never got my call answered. That's very unprofessional and shows poor customer service. It would have been very simple to say that orders were no longer being accepted due to the time, that is completely understandable."}
{"text":"THE BEST BURGERS IN THE WORLD.  

The bacon cheese burger is a work of art.  The meat is substantial in portion and texture.  The toppings are hearty and fresh. The bacon is crispy to perfection. The cheese is amazing.  The design and proportion of the whole burger is perfect. It is also substantial in size. It feels like a real burger, and is more of a traditional style than burger priest or holy chuck.  

Killer fries.  And the portions are insane.  

The line ups move fast compared to holy chuck or burger priest, it is the perfect traditional burger (that you could actually eat everyday.... I nearly do),  and the fries are killer.  For these reasons I find this place to be better than its competitors. 

If they had milkshakes that would just make my head explode.  But I am not sure I could even finish a burger, fries, milkshakes combo.  That sounds like a heart attack waiting to happen.  But it is something I like about some of its competitors.  

Bacon cheese burger here is the holy grail of burgers."}
{"text":"Pricey for fast food but so much better than the usual places like McDonald's, Jack in the Box, and even In n Out. A burger is about $8.00 but they're good and the fries are fantastic! 3 burgers, 1 large order of fries and 3 regular sodas cost $33.00. We each had a single patty cheeseburger which comes on a nice sesame seed bun. You can pick your toppings from all the usual standards. The fries are fresh and thick like I prefer and fried perfectly. A large order is more than enough for several people to share. 

The restaurant itself is super clean which is so rare and the staff is friendly. There is plenty of seating, and peanuts while you wait for your burgers to be ready. They also have those Coke machines where you can creat your own blend."}
{"text":"WAY better option for a burger than your typical fast food chain. 
It's a better quality burger than your McDonald's or Burger King. They also understand the concept of wrapping you burger in lettuce, rather than having a typical bun. You choose your own toppings from a long list of options and you also get the option of one or two burgers per sandwich. 
The fries are great, and they make sure you get plenty of them overflowing the bag. If you order a small fry, it might as well be a large. You will definitely get your money's worth!"}
{"text":"Allen is the man! He helped us out in ways we couldn't imagine, thanks so much for your generosity. The burgers were 5/5 and the fries were delicious as expected. The drink machine is great too with 150+ combinations. Love this place! Much love from Sheevaa! 

*S*"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. Pat is a genuine great person as well as the rest of the staff. We love you guys for helping us out!

{"text":"Five guys is my boyfriend and I's fave fave burger place! We're always proud to say rhat it's waaaay more better than LA's In n out.  Menu is simple, ingredients are always fresh, and with their patty alone- is definitely yummy! We always order the kid's size burger (for each) bc it's big enough for us. Milkshake is also a good pair for your burger!"}
{"text":"Fast service, awesome food, one of my favorite burger places, but DARN, prices have went up!!!!!!! Jeeze! 7.19 for a regular hamburger! Holy moly! I remember when it use to be 5 dollars and some change for one! Will return though, love it here!"}
{"text":"The first thing I don't really get is all the peanuts.  The place has a help yourself barrel leading up to the line and peanut shells scatter the place.  If you have an allergy to peanuts don't even walk into this place!  Still I love shelled peanuts but I just don't understand why they have them in such abundance.

I've been to Five Guys years ago because they have one in Aventura mall near North Miami and they do things a little different from the one in Etobicoke.  First of all it's in a food court so they don't have peanuts everywhere.  Secondly they don't just bag your fries and throw it in the bag cup-in.  Thirdly the prices are not as outrageous as they are in Canada.

I admit, I've only gone to Five Guys once in Canada and this was the location.  While the food is OK, it's honestly not above and beyond and the prices greatly skew this review because what they are serving shouldn't be as much as it costs.

To put it into perspective... I had a bacon cheeseburger (normal, not small) and for the price of this you can get 3 to 4 double doubles at In-N-Out.  Is In-N-Out better than Five Guys?  That's a matter of opinion but price wise the disparity is as wide as the Grand Canyon.

While I don't dislike Five Guys I simply think their price model for what they have is simply too high.  I'd much rather go to a real burger place instead of an overpriced chain.  The bottom line I think they are decent but way too expensive for what you can get at many other places in Toronto.  We're not a small town, we have choices and I honestly think Five Guys is overrated compared to what else you can get in town for the same money or less."}
{"text":"It's a new, shiny Five Guys getting on base and knocking in some runs.  I like the way management was calling plays and keeping everyone on their game.  Nice start.

My cheeseburger was cooked like it should (I order it naked because it's better for me,  although I prefer it with the bun).  Slight error as the mushrooms were absent.  I didn't say anything since it was an obvious oversight.

What more can I say,  'cept \"Give the new kid a whirl!\""}
{"text":"Big red sign says they have the best fries.  That's why I'm here today.  Oh and the burgers are mighty fine too.  And free nuts !  Peanuts that you shell yourself while you wait anxiously for your number to be called.

You order your burger as you like it with whatever crazy toppings you like from a list that should satisfy most picky eaters.

Fries are $4.49 for regular which is a large cup of fries that overflows into the paper bag.  More than enough for 2 people to share.

Just do it when you're in the mood."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here ! Their poutine is great too ! The beef patty is so juicy and tasty. It is a little bit more expensive than most burger joints but I think it's worth it for what you get, you can actually taste the beef. Their poutine gravy is also very flavourful and they give you a generous amount of cheese curds :D . 

There's also plenty of parking spaces around."}
{"text":"All of my friends in high school told mid-Michigan native, country-bumpkin me, \"AARON, you've never been to Five Guys?!?\" throughout college. Whatever- suburb kids have their loves, and apparently Five Guys is one of them. So when I found this one on State Street, I was always excited to try it, because I had this picture in my mind that it was the In N Out of the Midwest - clean and quirky and simple and possessing fries covered in special sauce.

I finally got in here the other day, after convincing myself the calories would finally be worth it, and it probably wasn't as unhealthy as I was making it out to be. (Also, the main display picture on Yelp was less than flattering - another reason I put it off.) And boy was I wrong.

Pretty sure I consumed 408 grams of saturated fat for one of the most mediocre burgers ever. Also, the cashier made \"Five Guys Style\" fries out to be such a big thing. All I really got out of it was that that meant you get 5 (or more?) potatoes worth of fries. Holy crap, I've never eaten that many fries...and I threw some away. The burger was greasy as heck, and I was so scared of the acne attack I'd have afterwards.

Location-wise, the inside left a lot to be desired. It was pretty grimy-feeling, especially the bathroom. And there's not outdoor seating, which I assumed was a staple for and main reason for even owning a business on State. I guess not.

The staff could have been interchangeable with the Wendy's across the way. (Sorry, everyone I just offended there.) Just a bunch of minimum wage kids not knowing how to interact with customers in a non-awkward fashion. Overall, not a pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"I got a little bacon burger, cajun fries and a drink. They were good but I think overpriced at $11."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for a greasy burger. Isn't all that good. Yes they are made to order, but they take a while to make so I don't suggest it if you're in any sort of rush. Fries could be seasoned better, they try to make you forget you paid 25$ for a drink, kids cheese burger and small fry by having free nuts available while you wait the 10 + minutes for your meal. 

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either."}
{"text":"I come in this one night around 9 pm and there was just 2 diners, maybe they weren't that good. After placing my order in and checking in it got slammed. Stop stalking me!!! Haha.

When you walk in you'll see all these sacks of potatoes and boxes of peanuts. Kind of thought wow this place was rugged. It kind of looked like shipments of supplies just came in and needed to be put it back.  They also have all these achievements they've had from other cities on the wall.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/five-guys-burgers-and-fries-las-vegas-2?select=zqBS99qeQ3rEdMgjoyUzCw#zqBS99qeQ3rEdMgjoyUzCw Cool I guess but it doesn't really impress me.  The restaurant was dressed in that typical red and white coloring and old dinner design like almost everyone, In-N-Out, Dairy Queen, Steak n Shake, etc. There's nothing wrong with the colors I like red that my color. There were a lot of tables to sit at and they were consistently cleaning so that was good.  There was a good soda dispensing machine and offered a cup for water to everyone that didn't order a drink.  They had ketchup dispensers and bottles of vinegar for your fries, stacks of napkins, large glass windows to look outside.

Ok so down to the food. With all this stalling you'd think I was going to say something bad. Well Five Guys is ... A lot better than In-N-Out, for their burgers and fries. What they should really do is add what In-N-Out does with their fries, animal style, and there would be not even any competition. Far from gourmet but a real solid non-gourmet kind of burger. They are not inexpensive. It was $10+ for my burger and fries, no drink.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger all the way  w/ jalapeno peppers and A1 steak sauce which is a 2 patties bacon cheese burger with a bunch of good stuff that your gonna like.  Just look at my picture and try not to drool on the keyboard or phone screen. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/five-guys-burgers-and-fries-las-vegas-2?select=1tIXC5R7Q_U_GAo7KE8zVw#1tIXC5R7Q_U_GAo7KE8zVw Talk about money.  They should probably look into a better bun, it's messy when you eat it and I had to inhale it cause everything was spilling out.  Their fries are really good too.

I like that you can order in advance and that you get free peanuts http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/five-guys-burgers-and-fries-las-vegas-2?select=XB3X7YSW24C_zf8aysxQTQ#XB3X7YSW24C_zf8aysxQTQ"}
{"text":"Nice and fattening...
I really don't know what the big deal is about In n Out.  This place is way better.  I like how you can pick so many different toppings all at no extra charge.  Their cajun fries are great.  I usually dip the fries in malt vinegar (I actually told one of my friends that it's ok to eat the fries even though she was on a strict diet. In my crazy mind i think somehow the malt vinegar will cut the grease in the fries)....LOL 
The staff at this location is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Burger selection is simple and easy to choose from.... Similar to In 'N Out and Smashburger, Five Guys has a bit more juicier taste to their burger, the fresh jalapenos and sauteed mushrooms I added really brought out the taste. I'll be going back here again."}
{"text":"I went on a Wednesday during the busy lunch time around 12:30 p.m. Parking sucks. I had to park far. I got the little cheeseburger and an order of fries. It's my second time at this franchise. I was overwhelmed by the menu with the various toppings so got one with everything but mustard. I thought it was pricey for a smaller burger and fries for fast food, almost $9.

I got my to go order. My bag was so oily. I got some grease in my car seat which I later had to wipe off. Gross. I know I'm eating burgers and fries but the greasiness through the bags turned me off. 

Greasy, solid burger, & the patties were juicy. Nothing special but not the worst burger either, just your standard burger you can make at home. My fries was a huge serving. I gave half away. I wasn't crazy about the fries.

This just confirmed I'm on Team In-N-Out."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Five Guys. I was under the impression they were a sandwich joint before today.   At first glance the floors were a mess. Food and paper all over.  I was a little surprised that my burger was almost $9 at a counter service establishment. The burger was  cooked perfectly and was actually pretty tasty for a basic cheeseburger. We split a large order of the fries. The large was not what I expected in size for $6. However, they were fresh and pretty dwcent. I wouldn't write this place off but it certainly is not somewhere I am going to be rushing back to."}
{"text":"Definitely the best fast food burger out there right now. I've been hearing about Five Guys for well over a year but I didn't think I would like it when I heard the burgers are all cooked well done -- I usually eat mine medium rare otherwise they taste dried out to me.  But this was a huge, juicy burger patty - very tasty, and an awesome combo of topping choices. My new favorite take out burger spot - sorry In N Out!"}
{"text":"The food here is made super fast and is delicious!  It isn't a very healthy option, but I think anyone having lunch here probably knows that.  The staff at this Five Guys are always really friendly and funny.  They seem to like working there.

My family gets 1 large fry and splits it amongst the whole table as they are really generous on filing the fry cup until it is overflowing in the bag which is great.  They also offer a yummy grilled cheese sandwich if you are vegetarian or not feeling like a burger that day.  They also have boxes of free peanuts which are fun to munch on while you wait.  We love the special soda machines with dozens of soda options.  I am a diet cherry vanilla dr. pepper fan myself.

The shop is always clean.  They also have patio seating outside.  Restrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Sami was wonderful and greeted us with a smile. Best burgers anywhere. More fries than anybody can finish."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at this restaurant Saturday night. We entered the airlock entry to very loud rock music - I like rock music but this music was so loud , not welcoming at all. The front counter guy was friendly, but when my husband asked him how he was doing he answered \"I'm working on a Saturday night\". We guessed he wanted to be somewhere else. The menu is limited and too expensive. My husband ordered a cheeseburger $7.09. He added a large fries $4.99 and a regular drink $2.39. His total was almost $15.00 for a burger joint!! I don't eat red meat so my choices were a grilled cheese sandwich or a veggie sandwich. They need more choices, at least a chicken sandwich or salad. The french fries were limp and not as good as they tout them to be. Anyway, they serve free peanuts - but I don't know why- they don't have any connection to the restaurant and create a huge mess all over the restaurant. We grabbed some napkins and cleaned up the peanut mess from our table and chairs. The demographic for this restaurant must be parents with children and single guys because that was who filled the restaurant. The atmosphere was sterile and too bright, put a dimmer on the seating area, please. People coming in to wait for their take out orders had no where to sit or stand while waiting for their food and were sitting at the disabled table. A big NO NO.
On a positive note my husband said the cheeseburger was good even though the cheese seemed to be Velveeta. As we left the restaurant I told my husband \"I never want to eat here again.\""}
{"text":"My first Five Guys experience was in Atlanta. I was so impressed I looked into what it would take to open a franchise in Phoenix. Quickly discovered that they were already in Phoenix and anxiously awaited for this store to open. 

What a freaking let down. I agree with Justin D. 

Mr Owner, visit your store and crack down on the staff!!! 
I do not think it is the ingredients, it is the preparation. 

Overcooked burger and underdone fries. The staff needs to get it together. 
Did you even train your staff? 
Does the store manager know he is supposed to oversee food quality? 


This location's food is NOTHING compared to what I had in Atlanta. I thought the Atlanta store blew away In-n-Out. 

I only hope they figure it out. I'll return in a few months with hope that someone learns to cook a burger and fries properly. I mean seriously, What else is there on the menu??? 

The only bright side of this experience is that it can not get any worse."}
{"text":"These burgers are good. If you are hammered it's a 5 star kind of place, sober a solid 3.5. The first time I had it I ordered the regular cheese burger. Tip for the ladies whose mouths and stomachs don't expand like a boa constrictor's... go ahead and order the little sized burgers. They are still plenty big to hate yourself for consuming so many calories, but not so big you feel like you can't eat for a week. 

Of course the biggest perk is the mass amount of free toppings you can add to your burger. It's hard to decide, and yes there are some wrong answers. So follow Coco Chanel's advice and take one thing off when after you think you are ready. (I always thought that bitch was talking about burgers)"}

{"text":"Wish they had combo meals, would make it more affordable. The girl taking the order didnt seem to want to be bothered with, didnt want to give new customers the chance to read over the menu, there was no line behind us. wanted the order to be over with the second we walked in. kids running around everywhere, being loud. the soda machines are cool, but they attracted kids to play with them and make a mess everywhere. didnt understand the peanut deal, no one wanted to explain it. wont be back, not worth it."}
{"text":"On the weekend shift at work we usually have somebody do takeout or pickup and somebody suggested Five Guys. I had never heard of them but he said they were big down in the states and were opening restaurants here. The menu looked good so we placed our orders and a couple of guys left to get them.

It took a little longer than usual, maybe the place was busy or maybe it just takes time to cook their burgers. But we were hungry so it was lunchtime.

The good:

- The burger was fresh, it was tasty and you could taste the beef. It's also a double patty standard on every burger. 
- The fries were outstanding. Top marks for the fries alone and it's worth a trip back there just for those.
- There's a lot of food. I couldn't finish the fries but then I rarely get through them all even if I kept going back to them when I would have stopped for any others.

The bad:

- It's expensive. A cheese burger combo with the toppings I got ran about $15.00. 
- They use process cheese. If I'm paying more for a cheeseburger I want real cheese.
- The patties, while double, are a little thin. They're better than Wendy's but that's not saying much.

I'll probably go back to try it again but it's nowhere near being a top burger joint. It's definitely better than most of the burger chains out there but the price alone means it's not going to be a regular thing."}
{"text":"This Five Guys location is easily the least crowed depending upon the time of day.

Unlike their freestanding locations, this one is in Fashion Square Mall and gets overlooked by diners.  I have never understood that rational.

The food is usual Five Guys fair.  Decent burgers for the most part and a bagful of fries.  The only reason for Two Stars is the somewhat messy food presentation.  It's just the view of grease dripping through the brown bag, that makes you wish you had gone for a salad.  Which, might be the reason why there's a line at Paradise Bakery and Pita Jungle.

Sorry!"}
{"text":"I'll take Five Guys over In N Out any day of the week. Their cheeseburgers are tasty and huge! Next time I am ordering the petite.

The restaurant is bright and clean in shades of white, red and black. We are always warmly greeted when we enter the restaurant and never have to wait to place our order. Your burger is made to order and if you order the regular size fries be prepared to share as the serving is huge! They also have those Coke machines were you create your own flavor. It typically takes about 5 minutes for your order to be ready but it's worth it as it is hot and fresh.

They are little more expensive that most fast food burger places but the quality is better so it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great customer service and interaction.  Food was spot on as well. Great job guys, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many amazing things about 5 Guys. It was good but it wasn't anything new to rave about. Maybe my expectations were just too high from all the stuff id heard. I'd eat there again."}
{"text":"Great burger and fries like usual!

Love the fact that they are gluten-free friendly.

I had a concern when I received a large fries for $4.99 that was the same size as the regular for $2.99 but they were friendly and will resolve this for me!"}
{"text":"As expected, great quality, fast service and reliable food.
French fries at five guys are what draw me every time.
Their cleanliness and consistency is on par with a higher end experience.
Price is a bit on the higher side for a \"fast food\" environment."}
{"text":"Yum!  Very good burgers, cajun fries.  Staff super-friendly. 

Came here on a good friend's reccomendation who has been to this location as well as ones in the DC area. 

When you come in, I was thinking this was Licks warmed over. 
Very simple menu...fast food basics, or so it appeared. 

It was 9:00 PM and we were in for an evening snack.  
Asked the server @ different things...one thing to note if you haven't been before is regular burger is 2 1/3 lb patties...HUGE.  Their small burger is a single patty, which is what I ordered with some cajun fries. 
I liked that they had \"build your own\" fixings.  

Burger took @ 10 mins to prepare and serve, which was fine by me as you could go back to your table with your (self-serve) drinks and bonus shelled peanuts.   

Burger was excellent!   Warning! Fresh Jalapeno peppers as opposed to milder, pickled type.   I like hot, but WHOOSH!  Top that off with cajun fries...I was downing 2 large pops LOL Not complaining, as I do like the hot stuff.  

Anyway, overall, a very good first experience with the 5 guys."}
{"text":"If In n' Out and Fuddrockers had an affair, Five Guys would be the illegitimate child (children?).

The red and white colors, and the uniform workers reminded me of In n Out. Building/ordering your own style burger reminds of Fudds.

I usually don't like the make your own burger joints, because I like to try the unique burger styles of different places. You know, what they come up with. But my burger ended up great and still unique.

Their main burgers come with two patties. I ordered the bacon Cheeseburger with grilled onions, mushrooms, mustard and BBQ sauce, and it came out mighty tasty. 

They also take great pride in their fries. I'm not a big fry guy, but they did seem good. They have bags of potatos all over the floor. And they tell you where in Idaho they come from. 

The place seems pretty trendy. It was packed when we went."}
{"text":"Thank God this place is open until 3am on Friday and Saturday nights. After the NYE countdown everyone flooded this place for some food and unfortunately is showed. There was food, drinks and trash EVERYWHERE!! Not to mention the staff was slightly on edge... but I'll attribute that to the fact most of the patrons were drunk.

I would say that the location is great... the hours are nice, but it's a pretty standard five guys. I don't care for their burgers, but adore the hot dogs... the fries hit the spot, but am I the only person that feel like they give you too many?"}
{"text":"Greasy but delicious! The lettuce wrap burger falls apart and gets all over my hands but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great Burgers! Really fun place to stop by for a burger. Everything is fresh, well prepared and a lot of options for toppings and prep. The double burger is ridiculous! A little pricey compared to In-N-Out right next door."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite burger joint on most days, but sometimes a little change is a great thing. Their burgers are good \"all the way\" and their staff is good looking and friendly. For days when a double-double animal style is just to ordinary, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. One of my husbands favorite burger spots. I appreciate they have hot dogs that I can get lots of veggies on. I liked the mix n match drink options. Raspberry seltzer water was a nice option. The fries...I just don't understand why people like these. WAY too greasy. My husband would give them a five star if the buns were heated. To resolve this, he keeps it wrapped up for a minute or two after it's been served so the burger heats Nd softens a little."}
{"text":"Great overall experience. Greeted upon entry, free peanuts, burger was good. Customer service was great. They didn't have ranch which I would have liked for the fries, but the staff made a sauce for me. They were checking the temps and sanitation while we were there, so I feel comfortable that they keep the restaurant food safe."}
{"text":"Working uptown on a Saturday, not a lot of good places to grab lunch unless you wonder away from Trade and Tryon ...

I've been to this Five Guys location several times as I work uptown ... and consistently, you are greeted with a smile and a \"Welcome to Five Guys Sir, how are you today\"? ... The two gentlemen who were there when I first walked in both the guy manning the register and the guy manning the grill were both friendly, professional and courteous ...

And do I even need to comment on the burger and fries I got??  Didn't think so because consistent with Five Guys I've been to from Los Angeles to Kansas City to Charlotte ... and other points around the country .. you can count on one thing when you're in a new city ... if there is a Five Guys, you're going to have an awesome burger and fries and will not have to wonder \"is this going to be as good as the one back home\"? ... don't worry ... it is...

So if you're visiting Uptown Charlotte and lunch time rolls around and it's Saturday ... stroll over to the Epicenter shopping promenade area and do like I do ... pass by the string of other places and head to Five Guys ...  You can thank me later ... :)"}
{"text":"Thought I was going to feel full forever after I ate this burger the double patty, I couldnt quit eating it was very good and im not one to eat a lot at once lol."}
{"text":"Best cheeseburger in whole of Pittsburgh! I have tried many places but this one tastes Authentic"}
{"text":"Walking in to Five Guys, I was rather excited, and was looking forward to my experience. I have never been to a Five Guys before, so this was something new. My first reaction upon opening the doors was the music was blaring. Too loud, at least. The music was classic rock, which I don't mind. After walking up and reviewing the easily understood menu and waiting in line for a few minutes, someone took our order. The order taker seemed like she was having a long day, not seeming very interested in the customer. While taking the order, one could clearly see the kitchen. It seemed kind of like In-N-Out, but everyone was moving much slower. It was as if everyone was moving in slow motion.

Much to my dismay, they did not offer Dr. Pepper, my favorite soft drink. I was surprised that they offered other lesser known drinks, but not Dr. Pepper? Come on. After waiting about 6 or 7 minutes, my food arrived in a bag. A bag? Really? I was planning on eating inside, not take out. Even McDonald's does better than that. Digging through the bag I first took out the fries, which were in a cup, and I took a bite. My first impression of the fries was they were nothing special, and too salty. I like salt on my fries as it adds flavor, but there was simply too much salt. As a result, in addition to the fact that the serving was quite large, I finished only about half of my fries.

Now onto the burger. I paid about $10 for my meal, so I was thinking to myself that this better be the best burger I have ever tasted in a long time. Unwrapping the product in its tin foil wrapping, I noticed that the presentation of the burger was sub par. The burger did not look appetizing, at all. Almost disgusting, as a matter of fact. The cheese was dripping over the bun, and I couldn't even see all the ingredients on the burger. Taking my first bite, it didn't taste bad. A pretty classic American burger taste, I must say. It did taste rather close to Wendy's. 

Upon finishing my meal, I was not impressed. My stomach felt greasy, and I felt the need to go hike a mountain a couple times, which I did, as Tempe Butte is close by. I felt my stomach almost on the point of rejecting it, it was that greasy. Seriously. Overall, Five Guys is way to expensive, unbelievably greasy, and makes your stomach cringe. The atmosphere is nice though, thus the two stars. 

If you had to choose between Five Guys and In-N-Out, INO is the clear winner in every category."}
{"text":"The only complaint I have that the portions of the fries are way too large, which makes them too expensive, $2.89 small, 3.89 regular, and 5.09 for a large fry! Secondly, the carbs in the fries are respectively 72 small,131 regular, and 181 for large. Whereas McDonalds carbs  in their  fries has 29 small, 48 med and 63 large. What worries me the average customer buys a regular fry, goes home and eats it unaware he has eaten 4 orders of small fries!"}
{"text":"For the record.... I order my burgers with meat & bun only... (I'm a weirdo) so I can't speak about the toppings even though there were many and the people I was with loved them all. 

I ordered a small burger, plain, and my bf and I split a small fry - which was more than enough for the both of us. The burger was very juicy and well-flavored. The fries were absolutely delicious! I loved the free peanuts and I thought the decor was pretty cool. It reminded me of a barn or a farmhouse. Everything was pretty reasonably priced and I was impressed overall. I would be willing to say it was every bit as good as In N Out although In N Out is far cheaper. My boyfriend said it was second best to The Habit - which Vegas doesn't have, so it looks like we'll be coming to Five Guys often."}
{"text":"Not too happy with my experience at this specific five guys. I swear Five Guys makes the best burgers and this location dropped the ball on fries and my wife's burger. Worst part was it was take out so I didn't notice the bad quality until I was in my kitchen. The Dana Park one is way better."}
{"text":"I love five guys..  there normal burger is really two thin pattys.. and is cooked to perfection.. and when you eat one the juices just run down your hands. this is the way a burger is suppose to be,,  messy..  LOL

the fries you give plenty of.. and the canjun seasoning is great.. I like putting a little vinegar with it..  what a favor combo..."}
{"text":"Me and my 14 year old son was on break from a chess tournament and decided to grab something to eat. I always been a big fan of this chain.  The burgers are are thin patties that cook fast and are so juicy. So if you are a big fan of big thick patties this isnt the place for you. However with two patties it is the same as one big thick burger. However the thin patties are more juicy. Also if you order fries for yourself, order the small. They over fill the cup and and you get about one or two more cup size of fries in the bag that you give you that has your order."}
{"text":"5guys is a pretty popular burger however it really isn't anything extraordinary.

$8.62 - The cheese burger was great, fresh and made with real no additives type of burger, good seseamed bun and plenty of toppings to choose from. The cheese was also pretty nice and really elevated the whole burger in general. The burger is not your general sized McDonald's burger its pretty big! 

$3.67 - The Cajun fries were demeaning, fried in Peanut oil that was clearly not regularly changed. Most of my fries were clearly burnt or tasted of burnt oil, they were also limp a very big indication that the oil wasnt hot enough when they fried it again. 

Customers! please be aware sometimes less is more, adding all the sauces and toppings will most likely make the burger all soggy before you bite into it. 

Managers! Please practice changing the oil before dinner service to avoid having fries all burnt and make sure the tempurature is hot enough before you throw the fries to refry!

In conclusion, for 15 dollars for these real non-additive, chemicals, or filler burger and fries combo. IS a well worth deal! It will definitely fill you up!! Also free peanuts! But.... It doesnt amaze me enough to come back got more."}
{"text":"Always super friendly! Placed my order on-line and it was ready when arrived, except for the fries that they immediately cooked and even tho they were so busy they still made me some fry sauce (regular and bbq) with a smile!"}
{"text":"I struggle with my star rating for Five Guys.  In all honesty, they are probably a 3.5 star place for me.  Certainly worthy of a visit, but not quite top of the class. The food is fast and fresh and the service is always friendly.   The fries are awesome Cajun style, splashed with a little malt vinegar.  The portions, at least the fries, are generous.  A regular order of fries is plenty for 2 people.  

The burgers, however, are just a little bland and messy.  They fall apart in my hands every time.   The regular burgers are also just too large and I'm not a small guy.  I always get the little burger and find I'm forcing the last bits down.   

If Five Guys would add a little seasoning to the beef patties and maybe zing up the burgers just a bit, they'd be at the top of my list.  Right now, they are just a notch below In-N-Out according to my finely tuned palate."}
{"text":"I love the french fries. The burgers are ok. My dad likes the hot dog."}
{"text":"Worst five guys I've been to. Both burgers in our order were wrong and when told they handed us the onions and mushrooms to add to the burgers ourselves. We added the missing ketchup ourselves too. They acted as though they didn't believe it was made wrong even though we had receipt in hand. Didn't seem to care. Buns were super stale too. While we were sitting here eating they started cleaning the tables and chairs right next to us super loud pushing things around, like super loud. Rude. They don't close till 10 and it's 830... chill with the loud cleaning and pushing chairs and tables around. Sheesh. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Haven't been to 5 guys since i lived in south Tampa and this location did not disappoint.  Food was great, fries fresh and hot and the service was excellent. One thing i did notice also is they keep this location way cleaner then the locations in florida.  Free shell on nuts while you wait for your food can cause quite a mess and people don't care when they are waiting, tended to leave large messes on the floors in tampa but here one of the associates was on it the whole time even while they were busy.  Drink machines where pretty cool with the touch screen feature. Sweet tea tasted fresh and changed out. Very happy with my experience here and the memories it brought back."}
{"text":"How can you not stop here..I tell you they can cook a burger up delish!! Plus the soda machine is insane mix till your heart desires with at least a hundred combination your sure to find you thirst quencher..so come in enjoy and be kind!"}
{"text":"As good as I always remember it to be.
Their fries are way better than In-n-Out (I am a fries connoisseur)

Their burgers may be getting smaller? Still delicious as ever.

I pass on the drink though, an extra $2+ makes the meal quite expensive..

Price: $9+ for the cheeseburger (double) and Regular fries
(in-n-out: $6+ for double-double and fries - half the size)

I would eat here every day if I had the option."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Five guys in 4 different states already.
We love them so much, great for gluten free people.
Fries are to die for! they nailed it to perfection!

I compare the pricing:
2 Burgers and 1 regular fries to share - $16 and change
versus in and out
2 double doubles and 2 fries - $12 and change

Five guys burger has more meat and toppings then a dbl dbl
1 regular fries equals 2 fries at in and out, and these are just the right crispiness.

As a certified gourmet chef, both are good but five guys at most locations are very satisfying"}
{"text":"I like Five Guys Burgers and Fries.  They are up there with In and Out Burger.  In and Out Burgers are presented all nice and tidy, Five Guys Burgers and Fries are more in your face.  I have to open wide to take that initial bite.  It is a good juicy, drippy, carnivorous delight.  I always order the Cheeseburger.  I like being able to add toppings to the burger when you order.  It makes it easy.  The fries are good, almost over seasoned.  Almost.  I still ate them all.

4 stars.  I am a fan."}
{"text":"I dig the setup, the soda machines are totally awesome, and the free salted peanuts were a nice touch.  The burger itself wasn't a bad burger, but it wasn't the best burger I've ever had.  
  This burger is more akin to a homemade burger, nothing fancy, but it's a burger made correctly.  I only got the standard fixings, so next time I'll definitely add bacon since that was recommended to me for a second round.  
  The service was great and if you're eating in house, they even come around and ask how you're doing.  They even asked us if we wanted more fries on the house!  As much as we wanted to take the offer, we were stuffed.

Just FYI
The regular burger comes with 2 patties so order a little burger if you're so inclined.

Fries:  They give you a mountain and you definitely won't be disappointed with the amount.  The fries are decent as well

Would I go back?  I wouldn't bet the pastrami on it, but I'll give it another shot if I'm in an ear shot of a location."}
{"text":"Its decent enough but not amazing, its a fast food burger but better then most...cajun fries are a bonus, the workers love to shout, which I think is weird, but oh well.  Its a simple menu, with a little more to it then inn n out, but its solid...worth a shot, but the regular burger is a double and you feel like you may give birth to a food baby after you eat here...that is all"}
{"text":"Yummy food it's been a good night. The food was so fresh and good. Especially since it was by a ice cream place near. The staff is the best to. The Burgers are really big. And the only place with free peanuts. But there's too many fries given"}
{"text":"Simply stating that this place is GREAT!. I love the fact that you can have your hamburger with all the toppings you want included in the price. I even had them throw in a side of grilled mushrooms and it was included in the price. The fries are fresh cut, and we ordered the large. It was more than enough for 4 people. Very fresh and juicy hamburgers. The one thing that all of us thought was pretty neat was their new COKE machine. By far the coolest soda dispenser I have ever used. We will go back!! I'm just afraid I wont be able to stay away. Also, I feel very confident in saying In-and-Out is old and tired. They WILL lose customers to this great burger place."}
{"text":"All I had here were the fries to feed my 2 yr old twin boys. I ended up feeding my whole family of five with the large order. So five stars for fresh fries and overflowing bag..."}
{"text":"Woah. 


What just happened? I've never heard of this place other then seeing it next to the Jimmy John's sub shop in Tempe and thought it was a local chain. I went to the movies at the mall this past Saturday (X-men: First Class, was amazing btw!) and saw Five Guys Burgers in the food court. 

I really felt like a burger and everything in that food court is kinda gross so I decided to give it a shot. 

Back to my Woah.....how did I never hear of this place? For a quick cheap burger fix...this is the place. I hear all the comparison to in and out but honestly I dont see it....this place is better. Dont get me wrong, In and out has good burgers that hit the spot...but this place has amazing burgers that have customizable options AND fries to boot....and please dont say you like the fries at in and out....because they are plain bad. 

These fries are large cut and freshly made that get just the right amount of seasoning on them. Delicious!!! 

I've also read a couple reviews that mention price and I do have to agree....I'm taking 1 star away for value. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger and fries with NO drink and my total was like 11$...that is a little much for a quick fix burger joint. I dont know if prices are like this at the mall location only because rent is probably higher but I'll check out the Tempe location soon enough and find out.


All in all im very pleasantly surprised that there is a decent quick fix burger option out there other then in and out and smash burger."}
{"text":"Awwwww man!!! The burgers and fries on their menu is to die for.

The customer service from the server was excellent!! She helped recommend what was good for a quick lunch.

Definitely recommend this place for Ryerson students that need a quick bite to eat between their classes"}
{"text":"One of my guilty pleasures. My favourite fast food burger joint. There's nothing like a burger and fries at lunch on a Friday to celebrate the end of a long week.

This place is popular so the line is often long. Don't worry, it moves quickly! 

If you haven't eaten at five guys before, the portions are large. The normal hamburger has 2 patties and the small fry is equivalent to a large at McDonald's. The Cajun fries are to die for - I have to order them every time. Prepare to be hooked!!"}
{"text":"The kids working at this five guys are such Hustlers and hard workers with a great attitude. I hope the management commenced these young people 4 running the show and getting things moving and doing a great job. It doesn't matter how busy it is when I come in these guys are always friendly!"}
{"text":"My first and last time there. Ordered my burger and fries and sat down. By the time I got the aluminum off the bread had got soggy and tasted pretty plain. Just ate the meat, The fries were good though."}
{"text":"I'm fairly certain I will get hung out to dry for this rating and review, but I just didn't find it as wow-worthy as so many of my friends have claimed it to be.  

Sure, don't get me wrong, their burgers are well-made and tasty.  I liked the simplicity of the joint and couldn't say no to their Coke machine and its magical ways. 

When asked if I preferred their burgers over Smashburgers or vice versa, I made a decision that Smashburger may take the cake.  

Five Guys fries were not that awe inspiring either.  

Sure, I'll go again, but will I got out of my way?  Probably not."}

{"text":"If you want an all American burger experience this is the place to be.

Burgers are cooked fresh. All free toppings helped create that very personal experience. French fries you just know they are fresh cut and the peanut oil (!) definitely made the taste darker and richer. 

Definitely a notch above your normal burger experience but be prepared to match the budget."}
{"text":"Walking into the place, first impression, holy crap it's packed in here! The line was to the door! Took about 15 minutes to get to the front of the line and order my food, and another 15 minutes to get my cheeseburger (all the way) and some Cajun fries. Well the burger looked messy... and it was, but that's not really a bad thing! The burger itself was like a mix between in-and-out and fatburger, in my opinion the big star of the burger was the onions and mushrooms, that's where most of the flavor I experienced came from at least. The Cajun fries were pretty good, nothing too special, great spice though! I will have to try the normal ones next time since after eating about half I got a little tired of the flavor (the large is pretty big).
 
Overall it was good, I'd easily give it 4 stars. Service was great and fast considering how busy it was in there. The food was also great, but nothing entirely too special. I would put it on par with in-and-out and fatburger. If you haven't been there yet, and don't mind paying $6 for a burger, go and enjoy another great burger place here in town!"}
{"text":"Holy salt lick Batman! Ok, maybe that's cliche so let's go with Duh-AM that food is salty! As in\" have some food with your pile of salt, ma'am\" kind of salty not Urban Dictionary kind of salty.

We went recently as a group and I don't know if the food tastes good or not. All I taste is salt when I bit into my veggie burger and ate the fries. My friends felt similarly. Hard to tell what the beef patty tasted like or anything else for that matter. 

Did I mention the food is salty?

That said, the staff seem very friendly and one of the staff members has a lovely singing voice because she was belting out tunes right along with the radio and she was fantastic. 

So I guess if you like the taste of salt--a lot--you should hit up this 5 Guys location. If nothing else, you might get lucky to be there the day the staffer is singing because that's what bumped this up to 3 stars for me."}
{"text":"Having tried Five Guys burgers whilst in Fort Lauderdale I was stoked to wander passed the one in Old Montreal the other day with a few friends who were in town. 

My experience with this particular Five Guys is similar to those noted below in the sense that the \"feel\" of the place is spot on, it's unapologetically a burger joint. The staff were professional and friendly despite the fact that they were clearly in the middle of a rush - the girl at the cash was efficient while still being personable.

The burger did feel a little sloppy though I'm not sure exactly what part of it broke it - I think it was just the overall building of the burger. The flavours were all there but it just fell apart (part of that is my own handling of it but let's be honest, this wasn't my first rodeo).

The fries, however, were stellar as was expected... fresh, crisp where they should be crisp and soft where they should be soft. Just add ketchup and you're all set. 

You should stop in and grab a burger - I'm a fan for sure."}
{"text":"Agreed- the price is whack esp if you just want a plain ol' cheeseburger. What about the kids? ..It's only awesome if you load it up with the \"free\" toppings which includes: mushrooms, peppers, onions, relish, etc. I found the burger to be heavy with a soggy bun. I would only return for some cajun fries...which is nicely put in a paper cup then in the bag where more fries are dumped. Other than the food, the service was GREAT."}
{"text":"Burgers are really greasy and way way overpriced.   In and out burger is half the price and a much better burger.  So save your money and goto in and out"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time today with my boyfriend and i understand the hype but it was honestly lacking of flavour PLS my burger was really cold...."}
{"text":"Two stars is for this location only because of the fries.  We have ordered from this location several times and each time the fries are overcooked and dry and mealy.  I hate having to throw away fries!

I am not sure if they are not being prepared properly or the spuds they use are old.  We have eaten at other 5 guys and the fries are usually awesome.  Hopefully they can sort out the issue with the fries as this is the closest location to us."}
{"text":"The service was good but the burger was horrible. I wish I would've gone to In n Out. This place is way over Price to top it all off. Two burgers, Two drinks, and one fries cost $30. That is more than Red Robin, and that is for service with refillable french fries for free. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place and wanted to give it a shot. I admit the burger is a good and tasty and you can really pile on the extras which is nice, but in my opinion the price is just too much for me to justify giving it a good rating. So if you want a good burger and price is no option, then by all means go for it. But if your like me and the rest of the world, I think there are better values elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 burgers and fries for takeout. 2 burgers and the fries had a hair in them.   Bad.  Will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"The pros and cons of this place are many. I'm going to list the pros first. Clean, friendly people,Burgers made of good quality meat and taste homemade, cheese tasted good.
And now to the cons. Do not, I repeat, do not order one of these to go! By the time you get home no matter how close you live, the bun will be soggy and disgusting! I've never eaten one there in the restaurant perhaps if you do it's okay but to take one home it is just a disaster! Another con is the pickles have no flavor absolutely none! 
I prefer to get an In N Out or a fat burger, any day. 
As for the free peanuts, who cares? That's kind of silly I think. And the french fries I just found them okay, nothing great."}
{"text":"When we got there the cashier Crystal... ( I believe that her name) allowed my boys yo individually punch in their order. She was so nice to them. I love the communication of the staff here. It brings up the vibes of the restaurant. Their soda machine has an abundant awesome  selection. free peanuts!! The bathrooms were impeccably clean. There barely any people in the place but they still sweeping this place clean! I love it!! This is THE BEST BURGER JOINT!!"}
{"text":"Paid a lot for my burger and fries! Tasted good but not worth $18 for a burger, fried and drink.......average flavor but great customer service. Very clean!"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries were really good. Five guys is always a good choice, anyways. Though, I rated 4 stars, because they did not get my order right. I said 'mayonnaise' and they gave me 'grilled onion'. (What the heck lol)"}
{"text":"Really impressed. Not only do I LOVE the burgers here but today one of the cooks came out and asked our family if we wanted more fries and then made us a fresh batch of free fries. Then my son ate an onion on accident and started crying begging for water (we only had pop on the table) and before I could do anything, one of the cooks had already run behind the counter, got a cup, filled it and had it in front of my son. Great food! Even better service!!!"}
{"text":"My expectations were high, the price even more so.  Almost $20 for a burger and fries combo is rather outrageous considering how generic the food is.  For that kind of money at a fast food joint,  I expect something special, and unique.   The Five Guys burger was good, but not good enough to warrant the price tag.  The fries, were, well... fries.  Nothing special about them at all.  Altogether, a pleasant experience, somewhat soured by the bill."}
{"text":"It's recently opened and was pretty quiet when we arrived. They greeted us promptly. We ordered our meals, which were tasty, but were surprised at how long it took to arrive since no one else was in the restaurant. My husbands burger was missing the requested mayo but otherwise everything tasted good."}
{"text":"Good burger joint with fresh food and great fries - Inexpensive and has some good options for toppings (fresh Jalapenos! and I love vinegar and seasoned salt on my fries. Its a bit loud but totally worth the classic burger. Hot dogs are great as well. The real drawback is you'll gain a few pounds quickly if you eat here often but In and Out doesnt even compare.."}
{"text":"I've heard the hype for a while about this place. The burger definitely lived up to all of that and then some. The fries are why I can't give this place five stars. Let's focus on the burger first. Fresh ingredients, cooked perfectly, quality meat, and most of all, it just tasted awesome. The fries on the other hand were just okay. Not terrible, not great, probably a step above a regular fast food chain. The quantity was incredible. The regular burger featured a double patty, double cheese, and lots of fresh veggies. The line when we arrived was relatively long but they were clearly prepared for the festivities. The team was hustlin' and bustlin' back there and knocking out one order after the next. The staff seemed friendly enough and the dining area was large and clear. Overall this was a great experience and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Almost a 5 star, and that's only because I think Alley Burger offers the best burger in the city. But, as you know, that's a food truck that you need to chase down.. and Five Guys is always there!!

Those of you who have ever managed or supervised a fast food operation know how difficult it is to maintain a very high level of service while maintaining efficiency and, more importantly, worker morale and satisfaction. It would appear to me that all of these ingredients are in play at this Five Guys' location. Satisfied workers = satisfying burger.

Couple things I didn't realize about Five Guys in the past: the menu is trans-fat free, there are no freezers on site, just coolers, and each patty is made from scratch. This explains the relatively long wait for your food (compared to, say, Mcdonalds; it's still not very long), but it's absolutely worth it. As for the burger, you basically design it fron the patty up with all the wide array of toppings being free. So you can't complain, right? Well, I can at least comment on the patty which tastes like... a beef patty. No, seriously, that's a good thing. It tastes like it is made of fresh ground beef which is what you expect.

Check this place out, if you haven't yet. I've been to the one in Deerfoot Meadows before and I must say that it would appear this location is operating as a very tight ship."}
{"text":"My parents told me about Five Guys back East a few years ago. So, when they came here to the Valley, well...  we had to try it. 

First off, the peanuts are a great idea. 

The staggered circular line is a great idea. It's these little things that you first notice as you come through the door. 

BTW, we also like the food!  

The idea of a Little Hamburger (one patty) and a large Hamburger (two patties) works very well.  What doesn't work as well is the pricing of the Pop and French Fries... 

I've read other reviews of different restaurants over the years and I have always felt the discussion of pricing to be a little..  well, petty.  

Okay, so now I've broken one of my rules, but... don't get me wrong, the fries are delicious , but $5.00? Come on.  I know in the restaurant industry they make their money,  their profit margins on the soda and side items they sell; but do you need to be so obvious about it?  

So in summary, I would say great food at a premium price which works most of the time.  Will we come back, yes.  Will we order fries, well sometimes.

Here is the real question...  
   are they better than In-N-Out?  

Umm, maybe.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was driving up Scottsdale Rd. on the way to my one guilty pleasure that I have In-and-Out, to have my once a month double double.  I looked up and saw the 5 guys sign, made a quick turn, and decided to go there instead after hearing how great this place was from my East Coast friends. I Had the regular burger (two patty's) and my wife had the small burger (1 patty) we split a large order of Cajun fries (huge portion) and each had a soda.  Set us back about $20.  Loved the variety of toppings we could put our burgers, loved the free peanuts, loved the variety of diet drinks from the soda machine (ordering a diet drink at place like this is a little twisted when you think about it) although they had run out of a couple of the varieties.  Did not like or dislike the Cajun fries after a few I had had enough. Only thing I did not like is the price.  If I had gone to In-and-Out I would have had a meal I would have enjoyed just as much but would have ended up with about $8 more in my pocket which is why Five Guys will not replace In-Ad-Out as my once a month guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"The staff is wonderful and the place is so CLEAN and the food is great!
BUT  the music is so loud that I could not speak to or hear the person with whom I came.  This is not the only business that seems to be doing this 'trendy' thing....honestly, the volume was as loud as it is at some clubs.  I could not stay.  I will not be back...at least to stay."}
{"text":"Can you say Dog Poop in your mouth? Cuz that's what you'll be thinking when your eating at this place. All these people hyped it up and compared this place to the Oh so delicious IN N OUT. Which is the best fast food burger on the planet. This place seriously gave me a stomach ache."}
{"text":"I've been hearing people rave about this place for so long so we finally decided to come out & try it.  I was most excited for their fries because apparently, that's what everyone says they are amazing at.  We ordered & waited about 10 min, there were maybe 8 other people in the whole place (who were already eating I should add).  We finally received our food & my bun was cold, almost stale tasting & the fries were soggy.  They say they make the fries fresh each time which I'm really not buying because we waited so long & these were not made fresh whatsoever.  My burger was just okay, I've had much better, I think the bun really killed it for me. 

The toppings are free so you can add as many as your tummy desires which my husband liked. I'm not going to be rushing back here anytime soon.  I think I'll stick to In-N-Out when a burger craving hits."}
{"text":"Find out where your little potatoes came from! That was so fun.  
 
This is the place you come to enjoy a good burger before you head upstairs to enjoy a comedy show or a night of bowling with the pals. The fries come is  a huge paper bag underneath the juicy burger. The peanuts were the only thing I did not undersand about the GUYS menu. Well the peanuts are not on the menu but they were available. I felt like I was at the game again...  
 
The price is right when you make it a combo night. So spurge and know your little french fries were once from Sugar Sugar City, ID! well not every night but mine were. Haha"}
{"text":"I knew Five Guys back when there was only one in the DC area, so the chain concept really doesn't work for me.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but just not as good as Five Guys used to be.  So glad to have them downtown at Cityscape though and hope they do really well!"}
{"text":"We have ate at this 5 guys a few times. The burgers are great and you get to eat as many peanuts as you want for free. I love it that I can add as many extra toppings as I want for free."}
{"text":"Good hamburger and fries, young woman that took my order seem to enjoy her job. It took about 10 minutes to get my food since it's made to order. Empty on a Wednesday"}
{"text":"I've had way better burgers. The burgers here taste like McDondals $1 burgers. Flavor is pretty important, and there was none. Although the fries were very good. I'll stick to smash burger, in n out and fat burger for my fast food burger satisfactions!"}
{"text":"Service is good.  Restaurant is huge and empty.  I do not like the hamburger buns.  They are dry and have a healthy flavor.  The meat patty is just okay.  The amount of grilled onions was to minimal for me.  The fries with salt are just okay.  I like the malt vinegar to dip them in.  The soda machine is good.  I wouldn't go back.  Smashburger is right across the street."}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars just because of over priced the food is. $20 for a hamburger meal? Insane! The burgers taste good but it's not worth the price. I ordered a chocolate milk shake it honestly tasted like extremely/overly sweet chocolate ice cream. I didn't even finish it because it was too much sugar. I felt myself getting sick while drinking it. One time at this place was more than enough for me."}
{"text":"OVERRATED! I was disappointed with my burger. I mean, it was good, but not worth the price. You have to purchase your fries and drink separately, which runs up a bill of around 20$. That seems a little steep for a fast food joint. I could get a full meal at a&w or Wendy's for half the price. 

They advertise FREE CONDIMENTS! Are you kidding me? I hope the condiments are free, my meal is already 20$!  

Oh but wait, they offer free peanuts. YAHOO

I will not be returning. Waste of money"}
{"text":"In times when only a burger will suffice, I have found that Five Guys is the way to go. The service is friendly and efficient.

The regular burgers have two patties and the \"mini\" has only one. The fries are pleniful and more than enough to share. I like how they will load your burger with all the works! They also offer veggie or cheese sandwiches for the meatless crowd. You can dine without breaking the bank and it will fill you up!

I especially appreciate the cleanliness. As I was eating, I noticed that if the employees were not making someone's order, they were cleaning.

My only wish is that they offered milkshakes, but then again their name says it all."}
{"text":"This place is A-OK.  My burger was good and the cajun fries were good.  Why do they not offer the fries in a small or junior size.  The regular is huge!  I feel the price is a dollar or two too high.  If the bun was a fancy bread I might feel differently.  

Overall good, but won't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"For a Burger and Fry joint~okay. We decided to give it a shot with a big group of friends after church on a Sunday. We dropped 80.00 on about 9 people for drinks, frys and burgers. The hamburgers were okay...i think this was a little over priced, but the food was really good. My youngest daughter who is 9 years old~wrote a review~ and said 
\"Drinks~good\" food~\"nasty\" only because she did not get her hamburger the way she ordered it...JUST ketchup please lol...i asked her to rewrite her review since she would be posting it on the bulletin board in the lobby for everyone to see. She rewrote it and just said the food was good~but would have been better if I had gotten what I ordered. Leave it to a brutally honest 9 year old girl to be so blunt. Overall ~ we would probably go back~but would opt for In n Out for a cheaper burger. :)"}
{"text":"Meat and cheese extravaganza!! Freakin' delicious although the toppings are pretty limited, but I do love the free grilled onions/mushrooms. Not a lot of menu options either, but bang for your buck burgers and fries are hard to beat. Can easily share one Large fries with 2-3 people as they give you so many extra in the fry bag. Free peanuts while you wait for your food is always a nice touch. Burger is a little greasy sure, sometimes a bit overcooked I've noticed, but all in all it reallllllllly hits the spot especially if you are hungover and just need a cheeseburger as your saviour."}
{"text":"Though the burgers and fries are above average. The cost FAR outweighs the value. Especially $2.49 for a regular size drink. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place my first time. This visit had a stale bun, dry burger and virtually no toppings. Burger was cold."}
{"text":"Dear server. After the amazing greeting you give your customers, don't spoil things by asking them how many blasted PATTIES they want. After working my brain all day, the last thing I want to do is to have to stand there and do your job for you by mentally figuring out what number of burgers I'm getting for my family then subdividing it by pi squared over mass times the acceleration required to stagger pigeon-toed to the shitter without trumping myself ten minutes after eating said burgers in order to determine the sum total of patties I want. How about you take my order FIRST. Then calculate the number of patties based on that order. And then we can go from there.

Also, try not to perpetuate the bald-faced lie that a large fries feeds \"four people\". Unless you want me to stand at the counter and physically prove how wrong that is. Such a statement serves no purpose except to depress a fat prick like myself and make me not actually want to order it next time, mmkay. We live in the US. Your large fries might feed a family of four pygmies.

Now for the burgers. Overpriced. As others have said, they're sloppy and greasy beyond all reasonable expectation. I bought three burgers, a large fries and three small sodas. The total was $34. WHAT?! McDonalds serves up 2 big macs, 2x 10 piece nugget packs, 4 dipping sauce packs and two large fries for $12.99, and I can guarantee you that 5 Guys burgers and Big Macs are pretty much on par with each other as far as I'm concerned. In fact I'd often just prefer a Big Mac, based on the fact that after eating one my hands *don't* look like I've just helped a cow give birth.

So the fries here are good. I don't mind the sloppy type of fries. But I'd go Culvers any day over the burgers here. Just woefully, woefully overpriced and absolutely not worth it. Probably an idea to pick up some fries from here and burgers elsewhere, or burritos from Del across the road maybe? Then again, I love Del Taco fries too. Three stars.. only just. We go here because my wife likes it, it's never my first choice."}
{"text":"Great burgers and service. I used to come here when In N Out is packed, but now I come here because I prefer 5 Guys. I like the selection of toppings and generous amount of fries. Simple menu, fresh and free nuts.....boom."}
{"text":"K08Ok folks. So it's my cheat day and I wanted a hamburger so bad I was tasting it before I even ordered it. I haven't had 5 guys in awhile and they have been my go to for burgers when I ate them more often.  I use to RAVE about 5 guys. So what do you do when you crave It? You go to your go to. I was so EXCITED! I ordered the Bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions, jalapenos, mayo and bbq sauce. I got my wife a cheeseburger with mustard, ketchup, lettuce and tomatoes. I also got an order of regular fries and Cajun fries and a chocolate shake. I was ALL IN on this!! I was picturing eating these concoctions with glee. I even was pacing watching them cook it. The staff was friendly. The place  was clean. My order was right. I took it home and........ugh. It was almost as good as McDonalds.....i am not a McDonald's fan. It was a bit dry, not flavorable and just very unexciting. I hate it when you crave something and it's disappointing. I thought it might just be me. So I asked my wife before I said anything to her and she said it was just okay and would have been glad to have it from somewhere else. I'm quite upset about this. I really used to love Five Guys. I have to take them out my top five now and replace them for my go-to. Even the pictures of the burger are NOT appetizing. I'm really sorry Five Guys! Something has changed! Not for the better! Good luck!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night.  Five stars for hype, two for the rest.

The burger - Ordered the single (just under $4) with mustard, ketchup, grilled onions, pickles and lettuce.  It was okay, but nothing that I couldn't fry up better in a skillet at home.  It's a fried burger......that's it.

The fries - HORRIBLE!  Dark, soggy, and extremely salty.  We ate about six and tossed the rest.  I can name at least a dozen places with better fries.

The drink - No complaints.  Free refills, and believe me you'll need it.  Everything was very salty.

$14.00 + for two small burgers, one order of fries, and one drink."}
{"text":"Today was the first time experiencing this restaurant and I can say it was better then expected. The burger was fresh and tasted as if it can straight from the grill. Fries were crispy yet soft. Well recommend!"}
{"text":"I loved this place, the food was great and it satisfied my meat craving!  The fries are fresh and hot, well seasoned. Best fast food burger in town!"}
{"text":"First time at Five Guys.  I'd heard good things.  The burgers are huge.  Too big to enjoy, really.  I didn't know.  I'd never order a burger that big, but oh well.  Then as I'm waiting for it to cook I see that all burgers are cooked WELL DONE!!  Well, I don't like well done.  I'm a Medium-Rare to Medium guy.  So I asked the guy (my friend and I were the ONLY TWO PEOPLE in there at the time) if he'd take my burger off a little early.  He said, \"No can do!!  If you had told me at the register it would be a different story but if I change it at this point I have to give you something for free and this company is VERY strict!!\"  I was like, but we're the only ones here, it's my first time.  I just now read the sign.  Just take the burger off a little early for me?  NOPE!!  How ridiculous can you get?  The fries are great but horribly over salted, and I love salt.  The cheese is weird and doesn't even taste like cheese and they use horrible pickles.  Two cheeseburgers and medium fries (the fries are huge and they dump extra in) came to $19.00.  I could have had two double doubles, an order of fries, gotten two shakes, and STILL had plenty of change left over going to In-N-Out.  I'll not be back to this place."}
{"text":"I usually quite enjoy 5 guys burgers.  This restaurant is fine except for the price... I can't believe a cheese burger fries and drink cost $14.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a big burger girl so I don't go just any-ol'-where for one. Five Guys has a good burger! When I remember to order the \"little\" one (the standard burger comes with 2 patties). There are times when I crave the simplicity of In-N-Out: I find their burger & fries much lighter & like being able to drive thru. But then there are days when I want what I can only describe as a \"backyard\" burger & this is where I satisfy that fix: heartier burger that has a more homemade taste & feel. That being said, I wish there was a potato chip option! If I was chillin' in the backyard eating a burger fresh off the grill, I wouldn't be eating it with fries. Now, with THAT being said, I'm not the biggest fan of Five Guys fries. It seems people either love 'em or hate 'em. There's nothing necessarily wrong with how they taste, they're just overwhelming. & I think it's sinful (not in the awesome way) that they give you so many. But I can also see the appeal if you're there with 3 or 4 people because you can easily share 1 small order. All in all, the staff is always √ºber friendly, the restaurant clean, the patrons happy & the quality of the product justifies the fact that a FG burger costs the same as an entire meal at In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town!  They are fresh and super quick.  Why go to some fast food place like Burger King or McDonalds and get some crap on a bun when you can get a fresh quality hamburger here exactly how you want it?  I do think the inside is pretty boring though and don't care for the 80's music they play but it's worth it to overlook that and eat some tasty meat."}
{"text":"Lol say good bye to my pay check. This cost me an arm and a leg lol. The food was mouth watering beautifulbess. But one burger $10 and combo $20. I cried a little but I will never go back because of that but it was really yummy tough. So ifu gave money than go"}
{"text":"Got a burger here and it was 10 dollars JUST for the burger. So overpriced, but I was hoping it would taste wonderful so I tried to be optimistic. I watched them cook the burger and put it together, but when I ate it, it just tasted like a burger from McDonald's - not fresh at all. It was gross AND expensive, wish I could get my money back."}
{"text":"Kids liked this place - the free peanuts and the burger/fries.  It is a bit expensive compared to fast food places but I really enjoyed the few fries I tried.  Can't wait to come back and try a burger myself.  The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"It was my first time at 5GB ( who are they btw?) and I wasn't disappointed. Well first, I was happy to find such a decently priced place in Old Montreal. Now burger wise, the sandwich actually reminded me of Shake Shack in NYC: juicy and tasty - yep, you only get the size at McD's. I got it fully loaded and didn't experience any trouble despite not being a burger gourmet. No matter how many toppings you will get the price will remain the same but don't expect a state-of-the-art customization similar to Gourmet Burger. Finally and fries wise, these were crunchy, tasty and so many. 

Well, I really enjoyed my first experience hosted by the newly-established franchise but I still believe it lacks personality. Perhaps because Sin City is home to so many little homemade burger spots which will charge you less than these guys."}
{"text":"Superb customer service, the bacon is so crisp, and I enjoy the accessories and add ons to the burgers"}
{"text":"It's just very average. One would go because of a different \"feel\" than the many burger joints in the city."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Five Guy. I ordered BLT and bacon was burnt, I can taste ash. It was expensive for a burger/sandwich... I didn't like it at all... I'm sure there are lots of people who loves here. :)"}
{"text":"Somebody tried to tell me today that it wasn't Five Guys that Obama visited, but some other greasy spoon way back on that famed day. I almost lost it -- actually, I did lose it. What other juicy burger & delectable fries could send our Commander in Chief over the edge & Gangsta-style, tell off his Secret Service agents so that he could enjoy the fantastic and tasty treats that awaited him? Five Guys, that's who!

Strongsville was the first Five Guys location that I ever visited and I haven't been the same since. Upon getting the super moist patty from heaven into my mouth, I knew this was love. Sure, I've sampled many a burger in my days, but there's just something about Five Guys that makes me say -- well damn, if they didn't get it just right! And the fries? Yes please, though be warned, even a small order is intense. Sure, you might have gut rot afterwards, but if that ain't part of the burger experience, then I dunno what is. 

I love this place so much, I might add them to my Christmas Card list. If only Santa would deliver me Five Guys on December 25th. Ahh, we can dream, can't we?"}
{"text":"Ok so my friend was hyping this place up because he said he tried it on the East coast and I was excited to make my own burger. At first when i went in it was pretty cool with the whole peanuts on the side, but I wanted to taste the burger to see if it was better than an In N Out burger. 

Then my burger came out and now it was time to taste it. My burger was a double cheese burger with bacon and onions. Sounds really good but to tell you the truth it wasnt anything special. Just tasted so so.

My fries were super salty and was hard to eat. I probably drank about 6 cups of water because it was so salty. 

Maybe it was the location that I ate at but it wasnt that spectacular that my friend told me about, and even he wasnt too impressed with it. 

The burger was pretty thin and just tasted like a burger and nothing special or anything. Just another simple burger place that you could make your own burger."}
{"text":"The first time I've heard of this place was in New York. It was my brother's first year of school, and we were talking about In N Out, and his roommate had no idea what we were talking about, so I asked him what their In N Out equivalent is, and he said Five Guys was their east coast burger joint.  Ever since then, I've been waiting to try the so-called best burgers in town!! I didn't have time to actually try it in New York, and I did not have the time to try it in CA either, so my friend and I went on a whim to the Las Vegas location!!

We were excited due to long overdue curiosity. So when we finally get in, I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and small cajun fries. When I took my first bite, the first thing that came to mind was In N Out and how the burgers are wayyy better there. The burgers were good, but not great!! This place has just been overly hyped, I believe."}
{"text":"Good old fashion burgers with any and all the toppings that you could imagine.  They give your more fries (seasoned or plain) than anyone should be allowed to eat and you can have your choice of just about any coke flavor that you could think of.  They have a self serve soda machine that has about 120 different flavors of anything from Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, etc and then on top of that you can any flavor to your soda.  Nice.

The only negatives that I can think of is that the music is WAY to loud.  I love music, don't think I'm an old prude but I found that it was impossible to chat with the people I was eating with.  Secondly - this place is really expensive.  My wife and I ate there and had just the normal stuff, burgers, fries and soda.  Cost = $23 and change.  We can go to just about any other burger joint and have the same thing for about $10 less for the same thing.  Just saying."}
{"text":"Idk, maybe Five Guys experience has just down since they came on scene 10 years ago.  It's not what it was.  The Cajun Fries are still the bees knees and you can get the free peanuts.  But the burger I had just no longer had the same taste of what I'd come to expect."}
{"text":"2 bacon burgers, 1 regular fry, 1 regular drink one water; $24.00. It's not a good burger, very dry and tasteless. Average buns.  Takes a long  time to get your food. The bacon was overlooked no taste and broke into crumbs. Very disappointed. Also very surprised how many people gave it 4 and 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is the place to go to if you are craving a real hamburger and not that premade frozen junk. My husband and I go here and it satisfies that craving and their french fries are delicious plus they add more to bag then the size of fries that you actually order. When it comes to selecting your burger, every condiment is chosen by you so you get exactly what you want. This place has been very consistent and you can see why they won awards =)"}
{"text":"I ordered a hamurger with \"everything\" - which comes with Mayo, grilled onions, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled mushrooms, ketchup and mustard and two beef patties, $6.99+tax. The toppings were fresh, the bun was toasted and crispy. But the meat was not seasoned, it was juicy but tough. Am I missing something that everyone else loves? It was quiet busy, and the wait is about 10-15 minutes for my order. It was very loud and noisy in there. But everyone was friendly!"}
{"text":"My family and I were out near Anthem and were in need of food. South Eastern has quite a selection of food establishments, but Five Guys caught our eye. We'd heard good things about the joint.

We pulled up, and the smell wafting through the air confirmed that our decision to eat here was spot on.

The girl behind the counter was very pleasant, asking us if we'd ever been there before, though she probably guess we had not, due to our staring doe-eyed at the menu, then to the peanuts scattered on top of sacks, then back to the menu. 

The menu is pretty simple-she explained that there are either single burgers or double burgers, and regular or cajun fries. We ordered burgers with a variety of items that you can add. I was happy that they offered every type of thing to add to your burger because husband was craving spicy, son was craving pickles, daughter wanted something BBQ. After ordering our burgers customized just for us, and regular AND cajun fries (we just couldnt decide!) we were given our order #, drink cups, and shelled peanuts. 

The drink fountain is amazing. Seriously. Having never seen one of these machines before, we were that family that hogged both machines for quite some time, trying to decide if we wanted flavored juice, coke, sprite, or water. With over 100 different drink flavors, it takes a bit to decide, folks. Our apologies to the customers who were behind us, waiting ever so patiently =)

Our food was served quickly. Burgers tasted fresh and flavorful, fries both cajun and regular were tasty, even with the Malt Vinegar that I used to dip some of my fries in. Daughter was happy to use crayons and index cards to decorate and then pin up on a board specifically for patrons-turned-artists. 

While eating, I looked around and noticed the decor. There really wasn't much to the place. Simple red and white tiles. I noticed that the burgers were wrapped in foil, and most packaging did not have logos. Less advertising and branding, let the food speak for itself. It works.

Twice, an employee came and greeted our table. One girl offered to take our trash off our table for us, and we declined politely as we felt she didn't need to do that for us, and then what looked like a Manager came and asked how everything was going. 

...it is now 8:55am and I am now craving a juicy Five Guys burger and cajun fries... off to see what time they open."}
{"text":"Another guest accidentally took my order. After patiently waiting a bit I questioned them on my order and the mix up was discovered. Manager comped my meal for me. Kudos to you Five Guys. Thank you!  Ps love the fries here."}
{"text":"Fuck yeah!! my new favorite burgrrr joint! You can request all sorts of shit on this burgrrr!! The whole kitchen sink if you want!! More than the burger are the badasssss cajun fries.. Like a big orgasm in your mouth with a little spicy kick.   

Ok.. just a little bit of a downside.. Higher quality meat means a little dry for my taste buds!  Hell yeah I'm going to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers! The taste amazing and yet are 100% beef. They offer \"unlimited\" toppings and the burgers are always filled loaded. I eat here once a week sometimes!
Their poutine kit is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"I go to Yoghurtys at this plaza and wanted to go in Five Guys for a while. It always seemed busy and the reviews were ok. I finally went in this Friday.
The burgers are way too pricy and not that great. Burger was dry and falling apart.
The fries were probably the worst that I have ever tasted. Limp, cold, some burnt, some under cooked. I don't know who would recommend these fries?!! I am from the UK and my father has owned at least one fish and chip shop since 1973, so I know good fresh fries when I eat them!
I will not be going here again.
Food is not of a good enough quality to warrant these prices.
People who go here are just for the hype. 
Harveys is much better, in fact a whopper from BK is better!"}
{"text":"Looking for a great burger in west Durham Region?  Don't waste your time reading those arrogant snobs on certain other websites (whose moderators would probably delete this review), just go directly to the Durham Centre in Ajax and go to Five Guys. 

Until this New Jersey import came along, the selection in Pickering and Ajax was weak at best.  Lots of \"meatloaf\" style burgers (yuck), the over-rated New York Fries-owned garbage across the street called South St. Burger, etc.   Time for the Americans to take the local yokels to school.

If you've never been, note that a regular hamburger or cheeseburger is a DOUBLE, while the little hamburger/cheeseburger is a SINGLE.    Unlike a lot of other places out there, toppings are free at Five Guys (other than cheese or bacon).  Grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, jalapeno peppers... too many places charge for these.  Not here!

I like to order a cheeseburger and have it \"all the way\" plus jalapeno peppers.  Perfect combination, but even with all those extras, the freshness and the flavour of the beef still comes through.   Fries are amazing -  they're cut in-house, never frozen, fried in peanut oil* and they always dump in more than you order.  We ordered \"regular\" fries, there was a box with the fries in it, and as many fries that were in the box, scattered on the bottom of the bag!!    

Another tip - always check the whiteboard on the wall near the cash registers, which tells you which farm the potatoes being used for today's fries came from.  In Canadian locations, more often than not you'll see Cavendish Farms, PEI up there - same generic taters as you can buy at any Loblaws. But if you see an IDAHO farm listed, you're in for a treat.  I find Idaho potatoes much more flavorful than the bland varieties out of PEI, New Brunswick, or Ontario.  They have this \"earthy\", umami taste to them you just don't get in Canadian product.  

Worth noting, I have seem some staff at this store who were there since Day 1.  You don't see that low a turnover at McDonald's..."}
{"text":"I never had Five Guys before! 
I also didn't know they offered free peanuts. So once that knowledge was acquired, there was no more turning back. 

We went there for a quick lunch and ordered a pair of burgers and fries. Then we sat down are devoured a whole bunch of peanuts. They were not the best, but hey ----- freeeee fooooood. The burgers were good, but nothing special. In the family of fast food burgers, they place slightly above McDonald's for me. I would probably eat Five Guys again, but most likely because of the peanuts than the burgers. 

I can't image how delirious McGill's squirrels would be to infiltrate this place!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The customer set is great too! I've never had an issue. I'll continue coming back here for sure"}
{"text":"Sometimes a burger is exactly what I need...when I go flexitarian and need some comfort from a burger, I go here.

Fast, delicious, and doesn't hurt the wallet. Made to order, fries come out hot and plentiful. 

Good location pre or post movie.

I still think they need to add milkshakes and call themselves, \"Five guys burgers & fries & MILKSHAKES.\""}
{"text":"Peanuts with burgers, need I say more. They have a sign telling us where the potatoes came from. How about just making them right instead of telling us where they came from. Leaving the skin on the French fries is played out and does not taste good any way. On top of that even if you are eating in the food is served in a greasy brown paper sack. What? is this an episode of married with children? and  we are Al Bundy? If that is not bad enough the burger falls apart when you pick it up. Not cool very uncool and fat burger is right across the street. I will be seen at Fat Burger next time with a medium with everything and a fat fries."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that the burgers are amazing! The workers at this location are some of the best in Vegas. The Cajun fries are the shizzy!! Sometimes a little too much seasoning on the fries or else this is a five star joint for sure. Clean, Friendly and Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, fresh toppings, yummy fries. However, I don't really think it's much better than the local chain, Cook Out, even though it's a fair bit more expensive. But Cook Out  doesn't have tables or anything, so I come here when I want to eat somewhere besides my car."}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good, the fries are very good and the crew at this location is very professional and fun. Exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"I love this place. The burgers are amazing and the cajun fries are pretty good. The soda machine is super cool....you can add flavor (ie cherry, vanilla, etc.) to any soda. Only downside is they don't have ranch or blue cheese to dip your fries in."}
{"text":"There are only so many places in the world where I will eat fast food. One of those is any Five Guys joint. Definitely one of the best burgers you will have. Gourmet quality patties and the fries are to die for. Try the Cajon seasoning for an extra kick.

10/10 any day."}
{"text":"Would rather stick to the value meals of bigger chains. Can't beat Goldenstar. Fries are pretty good though."}
{"text":"Before I actually set down and ate I had been feeling pretty pleased with myself.  I saw the huge line, I smelled the delicious smells of French fried potatoes and I also observed all the literature on display about all the awards that Five Guys had won for their famous burgers and fries.  I knew for sure that I would be well fed. Yes, that of course was before I actually took the first bite of my burger.  My dream quickly turned into a nightmare.  My bun was wet with perspiration.  My hamburger had a chunk broken off it and was smashed to smithereens and the cheese on my sandwich was cold.  Another swing and a miss for me and Oakland dining.  How many guys does it take to ruin a lunch 5 hahahaha?"}
{"text":"Okay I feel obligated to take off 2 stars because of two very recent incidents. On my last trip to Five Guys I ordered a little bacon cheese burger with jalapenos. My little bacon cheese burger had NOOOOOOOOO BACON!  That alone is enough to get you 1 star.  And I know I ordered a bacon cheese burger because I double checked the receipt. Had I not been so incredibly hungry I might have noticed this more than half way through consuming the burger.  I didn't complain to the establishment because I felt bad that I had already eaten so much of it and cuz I'm passive aggressive muhahahaha. And another time I ordered a burger and the cooks smashed my burger bun and all down so hard the burger completely lost it shape. It looked real bad you'll.

I will say that I have dined here at least once a month since first finding out about Five Guys and that this restaurant has turned me into a burger craver where before I could careless about hamburgers but guys can we TRY AND REMEMBER THE BACON next time!?!  
Plus the small fry is enough to feed at least 4 people!"}
{"text":"A friend in the Milwaukee area always talks about Five Guys, so we had to try it. Went their on Saturday about 7:00. In short, the guy at the register was not the nicest. I hadn't been there before and was trying to figure out the menu. He said he would explain, but really didn't. Just said the regular burgers have two patties and the little burgers have one. He was kind of impatient and then to make it worse got my order wrong. (Left off a topping I chose from their rather long list). By the time I noticed I figured \"whatever\". It's sort of awkward standing around waiting for your order - their really isn't a good area except in front of the soda machine. 

Good news is the food was rather tasty. Not the best burger I ever had, but pretty darn good. Fries could have been more crispy - but they were fresh with the skin on and tasted good. A bit expensive for the bad attitude worker, but decent food."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Five Guys before, and the woman at the register was very helpful in describing the menu to me and my family.  The service was quick and they were friendly.  But with three people, the bill was a bit pricey.  Nonetheless the food was good.  A tiny bit crowded, but tables were clean and tended to regularly."}
{"text":"Unless you want 1/2 lb of burger, order the \"little\" burger, which is a normal burger. All-in-all, atmosphere was fast-food. Order at counter, wait for your number to be called. The food:  just ok. It really was just ok. The fries were mushy. A lot of fries though. So many that it seemed they just threw them in the bag and tried to fill it with fries. The burgers. Disappointingly plain-Jane. Probably won't be a repeat customer. Even the free peanuts didn't win me over."}
{"text":"Not bad for uptown. Price was a bit crazy compared to what you get out there for burgers these days. Fries were meh, could have been better. But service was good and place is clean. I tried this place out because its close to home, literally a 5 minute drive from where I live in Unionville. I probably would come back here again, but it wouldn't be my first choice since Markham has tons of places to eat. I have nothing negative to share about this place because they serve good food, just a bit pricey for a burger I thought. Overall, great place to hang and relax. Plenty of seating inside."}
{"text":"5 Guys is the shiz seriously!! The sandwiches are yummers!! The fries are great as well. You can get the fries regular (which is ok) and seasoned cajun spiced (spicier but good as well). Sometimes the cajun spices are over done on the  fries but a quick sip of soda will get rid of that :) They offer free peanuts at all times which is super cool. All their foods are cooked in peanut oil which personally I never appreciated until I ate there. Its delish and the folks are pretty friendly. Prices are moderate."}
{"text":"Best burger hands down. A bit pricey but you won't regret it. The place has a nice vibe and it's great to eat in or eat out. Service is fast and friendly. 

Not always the cleanest place but neither is McDonald's. And i'd rather eat a five guys burger any day."}
{"text":"This is a good Five Guys.  I've been to many, and I cannot really differentiate this one from the others.  The food is great and is served hot.  Thank you!  This particular unit seems a bit dirty, which could be a challenge of the location and the swells of high volume, but I'm not sure.  I do not see anyone out there wiping tables, either."}
{"text":"Having lived in DC and having been to one of the originals, I've gotta say it kind of saddens me to see 5Guys go global. But I can't say I don't love being able to get 5Guys in PHX now. Because I used to have them ONLY when I was home in DC and then after my divorce and move west.. ONLY on a layover there. BEST burger I have had EVER and being from Cali where IN and OUT rules.. That means something. Always clean. Always friendly.. ALWAYS fresh huge burgers and fries to share.."}
{"text":"The burger is average, as are the fries, but is a notch above ordinary fast food. Excellent service."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys for the fact that there aren't many kids or adults with annoying food requirements. I am grateful for such segregation; especially, the annoying kids part, and the helicopter parents (or are these \"snowplough parents?\")

To boot, their burgers are fantastic, baring other competitors I favour."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the Cajun fries. They are so yummy!. Service was amazing like always. everything is made to order and you can watch it  as it is assembled if you want or have some free peanuts while you wait for you order."}
{"text":"I'll admit. I have a problem. Since my last review 3 months ago, I've made an embarrassingly high number of returns satisfying my craving for a bacon cheesebuger (two patties) and cajun fries. My check-ins don't even include all the times I've sent my husband or have been without my iPhone but I estimate about close to 20 return trips. The bacon in the burger is the bomb and there have been 2 occasions where it had been accidentally left out and we had to cry ourselves to sleep, but that doesn't stop us from coming back. I LOVE these burgers and their plethora of toppings. I get all the veggies + jalapenos + A1 & mayo. YUM!"}
{"text":"First experience at a Five Guys and let me say I was definitely satisfied.  A bit pricey for a Bacon Cheeseburger (the larger size), regular size fries and a medium drink.  It was about $17 but it was well worth it.  It was a fairly large burger that was juicy and delicious and they don't skimp on the bacon.  On top of this, maybe because it was late at night but they upgraded our fries to a large for free and let me tell you, there were a lot of fries.  A lot.  The customer service was great too.  The guy taking my order recognized it was my first time here and explained to me the sizes and the amount of fries.  He also recognized that I was there with my girl and we were only getting one burger so he offered to cut the burger in half.  Also, my girlfriend is crazy and likes relish on her burger but I don't quite like it so midway through the completion of my burger, I asked if they could do the relish on the side.  No problems here.  On top of all that, wait time was a total of maybe 10 minutes, maybe not quite but basically, it came fast and fries were hot.  Everything was fresh and overall it was just a great burger experience.  If I'm in the area, yes, I will for sure come back.  Place was clean and bathrooms immaculate.  My only complaint was the price but at the same time, it was worth it and the price wasn't even too too bad."}
{"text":"I hate to say it but I was not impressed with this Five Guys. I fell in love with Five Guys while working out on location in Texas. While in Charlotte for work, I tried them again and wasn't happy.  They got my order wrong first off and then the flavor just wasn't what I recalled. Too bad because I have enjoyed them so much in the past."}
{"text":"Eat upstairs, much quieter than the hectic atmosphere of everyone ordering downstairs.

I've been three times, the quality of the burger is sometimes a gamble, and my burger has been messed up on two occasions. Fries are always excellent, however."}
{"text":"This review is coming from a VERY happy customer!!!

On the day I went, I forgot my debit card and my friend could not pay for me. 

The amazing cashier saw our trouble at dinner time, and could tell we were hungry so he OFFERED US EVERYTHING WE ORDERED FOR FREE!!!!

I was so happy, grateful, and full when we left. They did not need to do that!!!

Thanks SO MUCH Five Guys, and I promise I will pay you back and come again!!!

Your food tastes AMAZING, too! :)"}
{"text":"Great burgers prepared fresh. Tons of fries. Enjoyed this."}
{"text":"All I can say is food is good... it's a Five Guys but the music in this place is ridiculously loud.  We aren't that old either hahaa !!"}
{"text":"Damn good, greasy burgers!  Today was the grand opening, and since I work nearby, and there isn't much of a selection in lunch around here, I drug my coworkers to 5 guys today!  

The line was insane, out the door.  Still, it was only about a 5-10 minute wait.  So, if you see a long line, don't be afraid to wait a little bit.  It is worth it!  The menu is pretty simple: cheese burger (double patties), or little cheese burgers (single patty).  There are a free extras like grilled onions, pickles, mushrooms, green peppers, etc. that you specify when you order.  

The burgers themselves are fairly good sized, juicy, and good in your mouth.  The hamburger is good quality, and the mushrooms and grilled onions are killer.  They are a little bit messy, so grab some extra napkins.  I wouldn't say this is the best burger in town, but they are one of the better \"greasy\" style fast food burgers you can get!  The fries are really good too.  They are fresh with the skins, and not over salted at all.

Final verdict: Yum!"}
{"text":"Lets start off with how willing I am to try again
I really like 5 guys they have a good burgers and now shakes (shake was pretty effin good), but the day I was at this particular location the burger was sub par, I couldnt even finish it. The meat had a grainy quality, it was a bit over cooked and the fries where limp and gooey. The crispness was not there. I was so upset, the ONLY reason I will even try this location again, is that I live close to the place. Also I think i had mild heat stroke that day. 
Im pretty sure I have reviewed five guys before and I do love them. So this location was just not on the ball, maybe it was just that day though"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Five Guys as I think it's quite pricey for a burger and I don't like that they don't do combo's.  I can understand the obsession with In N Out burger in the US just because the prices are so low, but Five Guys is almost gourmet burger pricing.  Maybe it's cheaper in the US?  Regardless, I'm reviewing the Canadian Five Guys, so let's just ignore my little rant above.

I order a Little Cheeseburger with everything plus green peppers.  I thought the regular burger was kind of pricey hence my Little Cheeseburger choice.  The meat patty was quite juicy and it was just over $12 for fries, drink, burger.  

The fries were piping hot when I got them and they also had free refills.  

Overall, it's an upgrade over McD's, BK, Harvey's etc, but it doesn't hold a candle to the independent burger joints and that's the one I want to compare them with as the price points are similar. It's not bad though, it's A-OK."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely amazing experience, customer service was on point, we where served by Nina and she was amazing being very knowledgeable of the menu and was overall very helpful, the whole crew had a very positive vibe and showed great team work, would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Everything to say has already been said on here so I will just throw in my 2 cents.  My wife and I went here for lunch on Sunday afternoon.  We both had a burger and shared a regular regular fry.  First off, the fries are excellent and a regular one is enough for 4 people.  I would like to try the cajun ones in the future though just to see if they are any good.  The burger was very good as well.  I think they are a bit pricey for what you get but I'm still a fan.  I guess all those free toppings make up for the high cost of the burger a little bit.  Also, the patties are a bit thinner than I expected but were still pretty juicy and flavorful.

Our whole experience was a positive one and the cashier was very friendly and helpful.

As far as Mill Ave. is concerned, this is probably the best burger on the block because I really dislike FatBurger's burger."}
{"text":"Food is good. However, we have been in twice in the last six months and the eating area has been dirty. Papers on the floor, crumbs everywhere, tables unwashed, chairs haphazard. And the place was not busy. Thought perhaps we just got a bad day, but when it was like that again this week, we shall not return.
As well, this time my fries were way over done. Shall have to drive a little further and try out another location."}
{"text":"Easily the best burger franchise on Canada.  Consistent quality in each restaurant.  Staff are friendly and service is fast.  One fries is good for two."}
{"text":"The five guys burger is pretty good, one thing is that I can choose as much as topings as I can. I select bacon berger with mushrooms, grilled onions, tomatos, lettuce, and BBQ sause. The taste is excellent, but the berger can be improved by heating the top as well as bottom of the breads so as to make it a little bit crispy. The fries are one of the best I have ever tried and the quality of patatos is awesome. I will definitely go here to grab some food while in a hurry."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Canada.  Awesome fries.  Hopefully a burger revolution is going to start up here like in the usa.  Worth the money"}
{"text":"This review is not going to be about the food at Five Guys. We already know that the burgers, and the fries are some of the best available. My adding yet another review telling you what hundreds or even thousands of other reviews do is pointless.

This review instead is about the business (Five Guys Burgers and Fries). This is a short story about going above and beyond in a way that demonstrates the companies forethought for its customers. They do not advertise it or say look at me look at me... They just do it and it is wonderful.

On this visit I was with a friend that has type 1 diabetes. Type 1 is not contracted by having a poor lifestyle, overweight or the like. This is a dangerous disease and if I am not mistaken you are born with Type 1.  With this condition my friend is also allergic to Gluten. Even eating something prepared on the same surface where bread had been will make him extremely sick.

That said I was surprised when he recommended Five Guys... He then explains to me that they toast the buns on their own grill; no cross contamination.

When we walked up to order that is when I was truly impressed.  You know how they call an order back and then the cooks repeat it to each other, loudly???  Yeah so my friend says I have a gluten allergy. The cashier says 'I got you'. She yells the order back and with it yells Glutton. All of the cooks repeat it. and then like an orchestra they all remove their gloves, wash their hands and put new gloves on. One cook yells he is on buns and another clears a grill, cleans it and proceeds to cook my friends patty.

WOW... They all knew exactly what to do. They did not complain about the extra steps. They did not look confused or not take it serious. Everything they did was so fast that it really did not take any extra time and the grill was full of burgers after his was prepared in nothing flat.

In effect the kitchen stopped, cleaned and then prepared his meal; and his alone all from one word being shouted back. Rather than feeling awkward ( I think I would if it were me with the special need) they made him feel special and the attention could not have been more individual.

My hat (If I wore hats) is off to Five Guys. this is an example of a company doing it right!"}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times, mostly for the cajun fries. Truly fresh cut fries and it's awesome that they load it up in your bag so a small order is really a medium. Although I did enjoy their burger, it was typical. I didn't think it was outstanding in any particular way. Worth the try though and you can snack on peanuts while you wait!"}
{"text":"Tried the lettuce wrap burger today.
It was great .
Quick service .
Clean place 
Friendly staff .
Fried smelled great ."}
{"text":"Alejandro is awesome. I've been here only a small handful of times and he remembers me every time and my order. Has a great attitude and a great work ethic he is a keeper!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was really GOOD. I have always been told that the burgers here are amazing but never got the chance to check it out until now. The staff here is super helpful. We went in and were welcomed right away with smiles! I believe it was the manager who approached us and asked if we had any questions. He told us we only need to order one large order of fries because it would be more than enough for all of us to share. Holy crap was he right! I'm a sucker for fries and these were awesome! We went for the Cajun style fries and yes, we ate it all. Oh yeah. I ate my whole entire burger too. NO SHAME."}
{"text":"Always a great burger. Not the cheapest....their \"regular\" burger (consisting of 2 patties), fries and a drink will cost you almost $15. Yup. No kidding. BUT it is a really REALLY good burger. 

I got their bacon cheeseburger and put my \"free\" ($15 \"free\") toppings on it and it hit my craving for a gut grenade. Very juicy and delicious.

They missed this time on their fries though....which are normally really good. But they undercooked mine this time. I wonder HOW they screwed that up since the fryers are on timers? Hummmm?

Hey all in all I love 5 Guys. Just wish it didn't cost so damn much."}
{"text":"it's alright!!!!definitely not worth the price!!! you can go eat at red robin cheaper and better (not flat, dry)
i ordered a bacon cheeseburger,small fry small drink every time i picked it up the bacon would come off (its all little pieces) very annoying!!!!fries...not everyone likes to dip them in ketchup!!! (that's all they have) :( 
overall....not worth 13 bucks"}
{"text":"I was a little nervous the first time I went to Five Guys.  I knew that In and Out takes great precautions in taking food allergies seriously, so they had always been my \"go to\" place for burgers and fries since cutting gluten from my diet.  Just because a place offers a lettuce wrapped burger doesn't necessarily mean they'll take the precautions necessary to keep cross contamination from happening.  And just because the fries are hand cut doesn't mean they're the only thing that goes into the fryer.

The first time I went, I asked the cashier, and manager about a thousand questions.  They were knowledgeable, friendly, and most of all, patient.  The anxiety that comes from dining out for anyone with food allergies is great, but you can't always dine at home.  I have eaten here several times and had no issues with getting sick afterwards.  I would highly recommend them to people with gluten issues."}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast but for the longest time, have heard of this place and not ventured in to try a burger until yesterday.

First thing I enjoyed were the complementary salted roasted peanuts. This was good because it's great for people that are hungry and cannot wait to be served.

My friends went during the evening after 5pm and there wasn't much of a wait to order. To pretty much sum up why this place is awesome:

No wait in line
Establishment was clean
Extra toppings for free
Two of those high tech fancy coke product dispensers that pours 10-15 different types of beverages.
Good location off the Las Vegas Blvd for those on the south end of the strip.

This place is up there with In N Out Burger and is less of a wait."}
{"text":"Ordered the double bacon cheeseburger mushrooms caramelized  onions mayo pickles
Smaller fries
Very fast so burgers were precooked unlike BP
I could have got the smaller burger
$15 bucks no drink so all things being equal I would go to BURGERS PRIEST I'll wait for fresh"}
{"text":"There is nothing separating Five Guys from any other burger joint I know. 
The greasy burger is really just a burger, nothing separating it from Burger King, McDonalds or any other restaurant that serves a burger.
The same can be said for the fries and the decor. Limp and unimaginitive. 
There is no lasting appeal, nothing says to me I should come back and try something else on the menu as there is really nothing else on the menu. 
It breaks my mind to see how this place has become a franchise, but here they are. 
I might return in the future if the near by Burgatory or Quaker Steak or Burger King or McDonalds is too buy and I'm incapable of making my own hamburger."}
{"text":"OMG- Forget In n Out! This place is fantastic! Ordered the cheeseburger with light mayo, grilled onions and pickles and wow, you are in hamburger heaven. Simply delicious. The cheese is melted perfectly, the patty is juicy  and the fries are good, with cajun seasoning. I'm not a huge fan of In N Out like most Angelenos, so when my friends said they compare this place to In N Out, I was a little reluctant to try it, but I'm glad I did!  I definitely love Five Guys  rather than In N Out! The next time I'm in AZ, I will place my order online. Oh, did I forget to mention that? You can order online and pick up your order! Awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been to the boutique burger joints: Burger's Priest, Holy Chuck, P&L, but Five Guys is my go to burger joint.  The combination of the double juicy beef patties, fresh cut fries and the big box of peanuts you can munch on/hoard when you're waiting for you burger to be made, put this place above the others.  The other places may have higher quality beef patties, but overall, they can't match the satisfaction I get when I've downed my order at Five Guys, oh did I mention the fries where the other guys are mediocre at best.

Overall, very consistent quality burger joint with a very unique feel to the decor, which with the music being played, remind me of the good old days when things were simple and stress free."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Jamira at the front register was so sweet!!!!  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ok we got to this place 15 mins and they didn't open till 11am they opened early to let us out of the 100+ heat, nice guys :)
We went inside to a very pleasing to the eyes burger shop. I was blown away by their soda machines with touch screen, very futuristic. The cup was fries was enough for 2 people and the burgers were large, juicy, fresh, and full of flavor. They would be a 5 stars if their prices were 1 dollar less. But overall I would gladly return very good food."}
{"text":"Five Guys is normally my favorite hamburger restaurant, but the last time we visited I was quite disappointed.  The music was so loud my wife and I could hardly carry on a conversation, the restroom was dirty and the employees seemed disinterested that they had customers.  

It was in the evening hours and I am not sure there was a manager on duty, if there was perhaps they need to do a little more supervision.  

I'll go back because I love the food, but I am hoping that they bring their restaurant up to the standards five guys is known for."}
{"text":"Just got phooked by five guys!  I mean Five Guys just phooked me. Apparently at this location they have a French fry shortage. My two large fries didn't add up to half of what normally is their small order.  Pointed this out to the guy handing me my order and he said you get what is available.  Apparently all those bags of potatoes in the lobby are for show. 

Do you (Five Guys Corporate) spot check your franchises?  P'd off and disappointed doesn't sum up my frustration. Should know better. Stick with what you know, In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Great food and nice people. Always a good spot for a good burger!!! Come here you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Five Guys Burgers dose it once again. I just flew in from the east  coast to meet my girl for her 21st birthday and fait would have it that after the Fremont Experience Five Guys it was. It was her first time and the crew at North Vegas did not disappoint. Juciy and Hot and just as great as the east coast. A+ on consistency."}
{"text":"Easily the best burger franchise on Canada.  Consistent quality in each restaurant.  Staff are friendly and service is fast.  One fries is good for two."}
{"text":"Probably the best place to grab a burger in Surprise and one if the better fast food burgers out there. Multiple topping options along with awesome French fries. I personally love their hot dogs but wish they were a bit bigger. I have always found the staff to be very friendly. There are free peanuts to munch on while you wait for your food. There is no drive thru so walk in only. They serve coke products and have the new fountain that offers a multitude of options. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars for this new, open since March, location just south of Cleveland Hopkins airport just off the interstate.

This is one of the larger Five Guys locations I've seen, and it is standard FG burgers (read: very good). A cheeseburger all-the-way with medium fries and a drink will set you back $12.58.  The burger is a hot mess.  That's a good thing - hot and a mess, with all the toppings piled high and dripping off in wonderful cheesiness, challenging you to get them in your mouth before they fall!  The burger itself is only mildly seasoned if at all.  Ingredients, including the bun, are all first quality and very fresh.

Five Guys fries are a mountain of potato goodness.  Even the regular size fries will feed you and a friend, maybe more.  Some not so good news - they're not my fave fries.  They are fresh cut and tasty with some skin on, but they are a wide cut and somewhat limp compared to the competition.  So they're good, but not great.

The staff here is very friendly, efficient and the store is clean.  I was approached three times during a recent visit to see how my food was and if I needed anything.  Heck, I don't get that good of service at some full serve places. 

California's In N Out still makes a better no-nonsense burger (make mine double double animal style), and their fries are crispier and tastier, too, but unless you find yourself magically whisked from Cleveland to LA, Five Guys Burgers are about as good as it gets in these parts for fast food burgers.  Expensive, but hey you're worth it...  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool place and I prefer 5 guys over any other fast food restaurant. The fries are made with real potatoes and the ingredients are all fresh (not frozen). More expensive then MCD or BK but definitely worth it!!! Nice dinner ambiance would recommend it for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place out for a long time but I've been hesitant because of reviews stating it's over priced. While I agree that the burgers and fries cost way too much I think the burger was delicious and the fries were as well. I never get onions on a burger but since they were grilled I had to give it a try. Yum.

The fries reminded me of the fries we would have at home when I was living with my parents. We never bought frozen fries and always made our own so Five Guys were spot on. I ordered the small fries but I still couldn't finish them all. Very good though."}
{"text":"I have eaten there a few times. And the burgers are pretty good and they give you a crazy amount of fries. My daughter loves the soda machine. But it is over priced so we would eat there more if it was cheaper."}
{"text":"Burgers always good... they cook the fries in peanut oil... they are on the softer side so if you like crispy fries... you may not like these... they are delicious though.  FYI... the little burger is one patty... the regular burger is two patties...  all cooked fresh to order and they have to cool coke machines too...  Oh, and while you wait there are open boxes of peanuts you can snack on while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"This place made me happy in pants! I recently tried 5 Guys while visiting my folks in Tennessee, and my parents loved it! (and they're picky eaters) I've visited the location on South Blvd a few times now and all I can say is WOW!
The burgers are inexpensive but full of flavor. All of the sides are included free of charge (like grilled onions, green peppers, lettuce, tomatos, mushrooms, etc) and you tell them what sides you want on your burger. Of course, sheese & bacon are extra. Made fresh to order. The \"little burger\" is a single patty of meat whereas the \"burger\" is 2 patties of meat. They also offer hot dogs, but I haven't tried one yet. My mom had the hot dog and loved it!
The fries are just sex! Simply due to the portions that you get. (2 sizes available: reg. & lg.) but they put your fries in the bag them heap another scoop of fries on top of that. MAGNIFICIENT! Fries are available in regular or cajun flavors, I suggest the cajun... not overpowering but enough spice to add flavor.
While you're waiting, feel free and grab some of the free peanuts and eat them while your order is being prepared. 

Warning: no plates or silverware. (which I LOVE!!) Just a greased soaked brown paper bag. Feel free and eat your goodies in the dining room or on the patio. Free refills from the coke fountain too.

You can eat very well for under 10 bucks... my colon officially hates me."}
{"text":"I kept hearing good things about the place, and they're popping up all over Phoenix, so I decided to give it a try.  I was not impressed with the place.

$11.78 for a bacon cheeseburger, regular fries, and regular drink (the smallest portion of fries and drink.  The burger was two patties, for a total of 7 ounces of beef.  Seems a little high for a fast-food quality meal.

The beef wasn't bad - cooked well done but still a little juicy.  It didn't have a lot of flavor, which puts it behind places like Fatburger or In-N-Out, and well behind places like Fuddruckers or Islands.

With so many topping options, it was a little disappointing to not have a cheese option - the American cheese they used was a little greasy.  It would have been nice to be able to choose, at least from the mainstream cheeses like cheddar and swiss, maybe even pepper jack or mozzarella.

I ordered it with lettuce, tomatoes, and grilled onions, each of which was better than the counterparts at In-N-Out, and probably on par with Fatburger.  They were reasonably fresh-tasting, but not \"good burger place\" fresh.

The fries were really not impressive - I probably should have ordered the cajun fries, maybe then they would have had some decent flavor.

The free peanuts were a nice addition, but it's strange to have a place with shelled peanuts but no place to put the shells.  The places I've been to with buckets of shelled peanuts either have something like a bucket at each table, or you just throw your shells on the floor, kind of adding to the decor - this place didn't do either - not really a big deal, but just seemed a little strange.

Overall, I'd say the place is overpriced, a little bland, and definitely overhyped."}
{"text":"Good simple burgers. Made to order. No temps, enough fries on one order for two. And the fries are a bit soggy."}

{"text":"I am 43-  This was the best burger I have ever had- ever....  Fries were fantastic...  I ordered a regular burger and med fry and it was 12.00- bit pricey- but it was enough food for two people-  my advice- to go with the baby burger and baby fry unless your goal is 3000 cals for one meal...  will absolutely be back next time in Madison..."}
{"text":"First time inside a Five Guys, and probably will be my last.  

The place gets 3 stars for: Cleanliness, unique decor/concept (free peanuts everywhere), and simple, easy to read menu.

The problem is, their over-hyped burger.  This is supposed to be the best burger in town, and it very clearly isn't.  The fries were pretty good, however.  But the burger, for $9, you'd expect real cheese.  Not so, it's processed.  The patties were cooked well done.  No flavor on the meat whatsoever (no salt, no pepper).  The standard \"everything\" toppings included mushrooms, onions, pickles, mustard, mayo... just not a good flavor profile.  The bun was very reminiscent of Carl's Jr. sesame seed bun, so nothing special there either.  

All in all, the place looked promising, the peanuts were a neat touch, the menu looked decently done, but ultimately they didn't deliver on taste.  If the burger was $5, I might be back (in much the same way I return to Burger King every now and then), but for these prices I'm going to a sit down restaurant!"}
{"text":"It takes a lot to make me unhappy when eating out. I figure if you are cooking and I don't have to then high five! Poor service on the other hand is a big deal. This place is being run by sullen teenagers. That's fine, it's an age. I ordered a grilled cheese that came out sad and sticky and cold. I was nice about it ( never mess with people that make your food) and asked if I could get something else. I was then charged for a replacement and told that sad sticky and cold was standard and that I was on my own. I'm pretty shocked that they would have that attitude. I had to buy a second lunch to eat with my friends."}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to phenomenal... It just wasn't. I think I would rather go to Smashburger. You get"}
{"text":"We always place web orders and ask that they drop the fries right away because we are usually there right when the order is done. On- line it says the order will be ready in 8 minutes. On this particular day we placed our web order at 3:43pm. I arrive at 3:59pm. They said my order just came through and was not ready. I didn't get my order until 4:08pm. Once I got home, we found out that it wasn't even the correct order! Very frustrating! I saw an order sitting when I arrived but they said it wasn't mine. These kids that work there act like they are in a daze. Like they don't know what's going on. No sense of urgency. There is a reason we place a web order and ask that the fries be dropped right away. We expect our order be correct and ready within 10 min. It's wasn't even busy. 
I get its just a order for burgers but service is service which we are paying for. 
I gave two stars because we like the burgers at 5Guys but the service needs improvement."}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good. I don't really like the style of fries. It's kind of annoying that they only give them in to go bags. It's annoying that the cup that holds the fries is too small for the actual portioning of the fries. The burgers are over priced and so are the fries. I don't appreciate them bumping music either. I don't go in there playing my music, they shouldn't be playing loud rap trying to get us to leave. I get that they closed but then again it wasn't busy and the tables were dirty. We came in 20 minutes before closing so I understand that they play music after closing, but don't blast it for three people."}
{"text":"We went here for a late lunch. As always we were greeted when we entered the restaurant.  We went to order and I wanted to try out the \"secret\" menu that I saw on the Web. I ordered a grilled cheese with a hamburger patty, bacon, grilled mushrooms and extra pickles. It took the cashier a little bit to figure it out, but she did.  Our orders came out just fine and my secret menu \"patty melt\" was SO GOOD!

Went in on a different day for an online order like I have in the past and was not greeted as usual nor acknowledged while I stood at the pick up side. I just looked at everyone no one asked if I needed assistance. I tried to say excuse me and they just kept their heads down. They weren't even busy.  I just wanted to tell them I was there to pick up my online order so that they could start on my fries. They do not start your fry order until you arrive so that they are fresh when you pick up your order. Since they didn't acknowledge me for at least 5 minutes of standing there, I sent my daughter to at least tell them we were trying to pick up our online order. Finally after her saying excuse me a few times they acknowledged her. We got our order a couple of minutes after that and left. Maybe they were having an off day? 

I'll still go back. I can't get enough of my secret menu patty melt. Lol"}
{"text":"This the Mecca of burgers!
The best burgers I had in 3 continents!

The freshness, quantity and Juicy meat make 5-Guys the best place. I come here so often that now I get \"See you Tomorrow\" greetings when i leave!

I love the place n people, i know them by name and so they do, I'm here atleast 2-3 times a week!

Last 6 months haven't eaten burgers anywhere else aince first visiting them, except for Thanksgiving when they were closed. And I don't think i'd go anywhere else!

A fan of 5-Guys!"}

And not only that don't be fouled when ordering fries. If you ask how big a medium is you may think you need more. But they put the whole cup that they show you but double. I live this place"}
{"text":"Same red/white colors as in-n-out however twice the price and half the flavor...very disappointing and i'm not even a fan of in-n-out.

For that kind of pricing model, you are better off going to Delux, Red Robin, Blu Burger or actually any restaurant or dive bar and you will get a better burger for the same price."}
{"text":"Drove past this place a thousand times and finally we tried it.  Definitely NOT
impressed.  Ordered 1 bacon cheese burger with tomato, lettuce and onion.
It comes with a lot  of thousand island dressing.  So the bun was soggy,
my sweetie ordered a bacon cheese burger dry.  Catsup on the side and
one order of fries. $16 bucks.   I will take IN  and Out anyday.   In and Out  
has smaller portions but  I  don't know why but maybe it is because In and Out
owns the bun and meat concessions and has a higher standard, no matter
where you go for In  and Out its always good.  But eat it  quick because like all
fast food its shelf life is very very short.  Be warned!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had in my life. Super fresh and well worth the wait (they prepare and cook your food right in front of you). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So thanks to yelp my husband and I decided to try it for dinner one night and although it was late we didn't care because  this place got great reviews, plus they are very well-known in florida for being amazing. We were not dissapointed!
Sure you have to wait a bit, but your burger is not frozen, its made fresh to order and hand formed, thats right- hand formed. I didnt want a BIG burger so I opted for the LITTLE cheesebuger, and lemme tell you- there was NOTHING little about it. So I guess this place might not be so kids friendly cause there is no \"KIDS menu\" here. 
The toppings are amazing and the variety is incredible anywhere between the usual ketchup, relish to mayo and even grilled onions and grilled mushrooms all at NO COST!

Their most expensive burger the BACON CHEESEBURGER is $8.50.
While you wait for your juicy creation to be made you can snack on some shelled peanuts completely complimentary.  If you decide to get their fries please know that their smalles size MEDIUM is a ridiculous amount of fries that no human should eat on their own.
As for the fries I wasn't crazy about them, they should be eaten hot or else their not very good. I found them soggy.
But I will go back for the burger again soon. Perhaps this week..."}

{"text":"I will say that if you want a consistent burger every time then come to Five Guys.  However, now that I have travelled to New York and eaten at Five Guys there is truly wish the Canadian operations offered:

1) milkshakes.  The US chain offers an assortment of great milk shakes

2) onion rings. I mean if there is choice to pair your burger then onion rings should be on the menu

3) bacon wrapped Hot Dogs.  There are times when you prefer a dog.  This beauty had me reconsidering a burger on my third visit

But as burgers go this place does the trick for your burger needs.  I just wish burgers for two with shared fries and drink didn't cost me $28.00."}
{"text":"1: Small hamburger - no cheese.
1: Order of regular fries (way too large for 1 person)
1: Small soda:

Total including tax: $8.93.

I used to love 5 Guys and had not been to one for a while.  This was my first time at this location.  The service was good and friendly so no issues there.  I got my food, and the burger was the only decent thing.  The fries were ridiculously salted, and mushy - not crispy at all like fresh cut fries should be.  The burger patty was okay - frsh, not frozen, but it does not constitute the price.  I would actualy rather eat Hardee's frozen Angus beef because it tastes better and is a LOT cheaper.  5 Guys need to get over themselves, offer smaller fries and value meals, and improve their burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of Five Guys, but the burger game has been stepped up so much recently that there's just better LOCAL options available elsewhere now.  By comparison, Five Guys is a greasy mess with lower quality ingredients and less care in preparation."}
{"text":"It's good, but. . .

It's literally twice the price of IN-N-OUT and just as good.   The meat is not as flavorful, but they got a lot of toppings to chose from and if you like community peanuts, they got some hors d'oeuvres for you.  I prefer the no non sense of IN-N-OUT.  

Ah. .and they have a next generation Coke machine that can create all sorts of funky soda for you. If you did not grow out of mixing orange soda with root beer and cola, then you will be in heaven. 

For a place where you order and pick up at the counter, I can not get over the $12 for a burger, fries and soda.  I will probably be back, but it won't be in the rotation."}
{"text":"I've been craving a good burger & Five Guys never disappoints. 
The man that took my order was super friendly & repeated the order back to me which is a bonus in my book. 
My husband had a double cheese burger with all of the fixings. I chose the single patty bacon cheeseburger. We split a large Cajun fry because it's big enough to share. 
Tasty burgers & fries. I love the pop machines there too. So many choices. 
Always a pleasant experience here."}
{"text":"I totally love this place!
Been there a couple times for a quick cheat meal!
Service is always good, burgers and toppings too! Employees are super helpful!
The burgers are made to order so a little waiting time is absolutely fine in my opinion. I hardly ever wait in line! Definitely better than the other fast food chains around!
And dont forget the cajun fries!!"}
{"text":"The milkshakes suck here. They also limit you to only 3 toppings to where every other 5 guys allows you to add as many toppings to your milkshake as your heart desires. Plus is was very watery instead of a thick consistency. Not happy with the cashiers either as she was rude probably a racist. 
Not returning to this location again. Five guys please hire higher quality employees"}
{"text":"Visiting from CA and needed to grab something quick to eat between running errands and a show tonight. Saw this location on the way back to our hotel and decided it would be best to eat here rather than face any foot traffic and hungry tourists on the strip.

Thanks, five guys!"}
{"text":"Prompt service with awesome people working at the till. 

Yes, the food is a bit pricier than most fast food joints but the quality is what makes it. Indeed, you do get what you're paying for. 

The burgers are juicy and cooked to perfection. I love the options that this establishment gives to their customers. Wonderful, fresh ingredients. The fries are cooked well on a the times that I've been there. The Cajun fries are my favourite. I like how this place loads up the fries in the bag - you get more than you expect! 

Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"The first time I tried 5 Guys was when I was in Chicago. Like everyone, it's compared to West Coast's In-N-Out. In Chicago, I didn't like it much and now that it opened in Vegas, I gave it a 2nd try. I tried their complimentary peanuts and they're ok. I think the peanuts are too salty. I had a grilled cheese veggie sandwich, with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and now that I think about it I also ordered jalapeno peppers but didn't taste them at all. The burgers are messy, so try leaving the foil wrapped around it and as your eating, then slowly peel the foil, maybe that will help keeping it together. Cajun fries are toooo seasoned, I prefer In-N-Out fries. Overall, 5 Guys is great experience, speedy service, and friendly staff!"}

I agree that the fries were limp, and I'm a crispy fry lover. The burger tasted good, but I felt pretty ill shortly after eating it. Not food poisoning ill - more like over-greased ill. I don't really eat fast food so maybe that's it, but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I really like this location, not because it's conveniently located beside DIX30, the biggest gathering of big box stores in Montreal, but because it almost all glass. You can clearly see your food, the view, and the restaurant. The staff was helpful and bilingual if it helps. 
I've been to the one downtown MTL and it has a good location, but it gets packed too quickly and it's like eating in a hallway with only the door area with natural light."}
{"text":"Five guys isn't what it used to be , $2.39 for a 20oz drink , $3.74 for a fry and $6.79 for a double cheese .. Two people sharing a fry $24.92.  Looks like In and out burger worth crossing the street now every time ."}
{"text":"Had a double cheese burger and it was pretty good. Not to sure about the whole you can't make a combo business but it's not a bad place. Still doesn't compare to the burger priest, stockyards and parts and labour but for being so close to Yonge Dundas good for them"}
{"text":"My first experience with Five Guys was last summer in Long Island which was a phenomenal experience (and no, this is not a reference to Fire Island!), so you can only imagine how I excited I was when they opened up shop in Scarborough.

Despite being one of the unhealthiest burger joints, I had to get my fix. In both instances, I've opted for the little burger, which has one patty (with two patties being the norm at this joint). When I first had it, I didn't realize the unlimited options when it came to toppings so stuck with the standard toppings and condiments of lettuce, tomato, ketchup. With so many options to choose from (and at no extra cost), I went a bit overboard with the toppings this time around. I mean, who's gonna say no to grilled onions and mushrooms?! I learned my lesson that 'less is more' and the combination of all the toppings really took away from my overall satisfaction of the burger. 

As for the fries, I'd have to pass on future visits. If you can look past the unhealthiness of peanut oil, and prefer largely sliced, mushy fries, then by all means, go for it. The Cajun seasoning didn't really do anything for me either.

It's definitely going to be awhile until my next visit, perhaps on a day when I feel like splurging. And my next burger will be plain and simple, with no excessive nonsense!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the original Five Guys restaurant in Virginia, and several others as well, and now this relatively new one right here in Downtown Summerlin.

Beef patties with no fillers, more fresh burger toppings than you can shake a stick at, an abundance of tasty fries, and those fancy soda machines that let you pick from what seems to be hundreds of flavors...what's not to love?

The burgers have two patties, so you're not going to feel slighted when your food is ready.  They're pretty typical size in diameter for a restaurant burger, but with two patties on the bun, you end up with a taller than normal burger.  (Don't worry, if you don't want that much meat, you can get the small burger.)  Throw on a bunch of toppings (you choose from a significant list of options) and you'll discover you can quickly make a burger tall enough that you need to take several manageable bites (or use a knife and fork) to make a dent in it.  Our you can keep it stripped down, even all the way to just plain patties and a bun.  You're empowered to do your own burger topping thing here.

The fries are cut and cooked \"skin on\" for extra flavor.  Watch out!  You always get an extra scoop of fries tossed into the bag on top of your burger and \"regular\" order of fries.  I guess the fries don't want to be overshadowed by the burgers.  Nearby, you'll find bottles of malt vinegar, just in case you go for the vinegar fries.  (If you've never tried it, give it a shot.  I think you'll like it.)  Shake it right on, or get a small container to put it in.

Note that parking can be a bit tight if you really want to be right near the restaurant.  If you don't mind a small walk though, there's usually tons of parking in the nearest main lot just across Lavender Hill Dr.

So if you're in the mood for a hot, fresh burger and fries, with no unnecessary extras, go get yourself some Five Guys."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have the best burgers. 

Food: great food, fresh homemade burgers, 2 scoops of fries no matter the size, fries are cut fresh daily, small menu to focus the quality on the food.

Location: good location in the Durham centre, large restaurant with lots of seating 

Value: the prices are very high, but the quality and quantity are worth it! 

Recommend!"}
{"text":"Aura: As soon as you walk in, Its a friendly, welcoming atmosphere. Clean, cheery modern music, & professional attitudes. You can see everything is made fresh.

Fries: They give you more than enough fries. Like twice as much you can fill in one order. Not too salty, but still are unique in flavor. I recommend the Cajun seasoning. 

Cheeseburger: Crispy but not dry. There's different sizes you can choose for your patty. A regular is like a double cheeseburger. Made in peanut oil & tastes delicious! I usually put jalape√±o peppers, hot sauce, grilled onions, lettuce & mayo. There's lots of options. But with any combo you like, the meat makes it even better. 

Drinks: They have options that range from Coke products to gold peak teas. Nothing special like typical Malts or milkshakes."}
{"text":"Five Guys is right by Eaton Centre and Ryerson, it's pretty happening here on a Friday night. 

The burgers are average. So are the toppings. However, their Cajun fries are pretty amazing. It has a great twist to it, they're arguably the best fries I've had. Only problem is that everything is a bit pricey for fast food. It's filling food, but greasy-filling. 

I find it odd that this is the only fast food restaurant (that I can recall) that doesn't offer combo meals. Maybe that's why everything is pricier because it's individually priced? If it's any consolation, there's free peanuts in the middle of the restaurant."}
{"text":"No matter what burger I eat anywhere, In N Out is still always the best, BUT... let's just say no one twisted my arm to get through this door. An unsuspecting first timer would saunter up and order a normal burger with all the fixings, naively thinking they would receive a normal sized burger, with an appropriate amount of things on top, that would still probably leave them in a coma. The NORMAL sized burger is two patties and weighs about 8 lbs. I have to order a \"junior\" burger which is one patty, and get mayo, ketchup, mustard, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickles, mushrooms, and hot sauce and it is STILL the size of a newborn child. The fries come in 3 sizes, small, medium, and large and 2 people can share a small. 

The prices are not cheap. For 2 people to each have a burger and split a small fry it was about $18.00, which I think is a bit much for fast food. I came in with my dad before the lunch hour and we were the only people there and it still took about 15 minutes to get our food. Bins of peanuts in the shell that you can help yourself to while you wait...don't really get that schtick but hey, whatever works."}
{"text":"A friend and I walked into this FGB&F hoping that it was like the other FGB&F restaurants we have visited in other states. It was not. The music was so BLARING SO LOUD that we literally had to shout to talk to the lady at the counter. I am not talking about raising our voices; I am talking about shouting. The music was at rock concert volume. After a brief exchange with the lady at the counter, we walked out. There was no point in staying since we couldn't have even heard each other.

I'm getting older but I'm not an old fogey. I enjoy loud music...but at the right times and in the right places. Playing music so loud that you have to shout to order (and the staff have to shout at each other to communicate) is out of place in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Well I order 2 Bacon Cheeseburgers and large fries,
After I order I request jalape√±os in my 2 Bacon Cheeseburgers but I never got them in my hamburgers so I had to request some on the side but you know is not the same and when we were almost finish our hamburgers my friend told I though we order Bacon Cheeseburgers and I respond we did but we didn't get any bacon on our hamburgers so I went to ask one of the employees about our bacon to what she respond you want some bacon on the side? I told her we are almost done but yea we can use some bacon in our Bacon Cheeseburgers. Not a good experience at this location I been to a number of Five guys places in New York and my experience was a lot better than this location. I dont think Im coming back to this location. Not worth it for $26"}
{"text":"Burger was ok. This place is disgustingly dirty. If a health inspector came in today, that place would have been shut down. Fries were good, but will not return to this chain again."}
{"text":"I went in with low expectations, and I tell ya.....Five Guys makes one hell of a double bacon cheeseburger. I don't care what ANYONE says, my burger and fries were fan-freakin-tastic! I'll be back eventually. I can't overdo it with this place otherwise i'd have a heart attack."}
{"text":"I ordered the:
- Little bacon cheese burger
- Cajun fries 

The burger was pretty good,  however I still think Big Moe's is better. The Cajun fries were stale and horrid. They were of the shoestring variety and they sucked ass. Come on now,  moist steak cut fries are where it's at. This place is expensive too, and the food was not worth the price. Do yourself a favour and go next door to California sandwiches."}
{"text":"Food is really good, but the staff is super!  I have yet to go in there that there was not a friendly smiling face there to greet you! Bubbly and friendly does not begin to describe! Huge portions too! Fries are amazing and it can feed 2 or more!"}
{"text":"When unable to decide where to go for a quick dinner prior to catching a flick at the newest Markham Cineplex nearby, we go here. Their cheeseburgers are delicious, double patties, and comes on bigger and mightier sesame seed buns compared to Burgers Priest (although BPs and Holy Chucks patties are more flavourful).

Always choose the cajun fries over the original five guys style fries for a little extra zing (spice). Also dont bother getting any other size than the \"little\" fries as they tend to throw in purposely double the amount of fries in the brown paper bag, always a welcomed surprise.

Peanuts are onsite available to help yourselves with while waiting for them to make the burgers. Staff here are always courteous. Only complaint I would have is that one combo (burger, small fries, regular drink) comes to almost $20 which is almost the price of dining at a regular full service restaurant."}
{"text":"This Five Guys location sits just off the main Concord Mills strip at the corner of Bruton Smith and Weddington Road. I had just left a sales presentation at the Great Wolf Lodge conference center and I figured I'd give it a go!

Picking up food for my girlfriend and me, I walked in and the restaurant is typical of most Five Guys in the area: minimalist red-and-white decor with a clean, modern interior. It has been quite some time since I've visited a Five Guys, and maybe I didn't notice at other locations but MAN are they PROUD of their product. The only decor on the walls are magazine covers offering praise to the Five Guys Burgers and Fries, most of them local community and state magazines. This time I decided to count, 30 magazine covers, with 6 bigger signs featuring media quotes about the food, and then 2 even bigger signs from national magazines or newspapers delivering even higher praise! I thought to myself, \"This better be the best damn burger the universe has ever crafted!\"

Unfortunately, I can't agree that it was the best burger. Don't get me wrong, it was a good burger! All the toppings are fresh, the buns are nice and soft, the patty is well portioned even though I chose the \"Little Burger\" knowing that their regular is massive. This is where my main problem lies with Five Guys: PRICE. I ordered 2 \"Little\" bacon cheeseburgers (one for me and one for my girlfriend), 1 Regular Fry to split, no drinks. The total came out to $19 and some change. While I don't mind paying for a quality meal, I know of many local places where you can get the same fare for less damage to your wallet.

Service was great, restaurant was clean as a whistle (In which, I mean it was very clean. Am I the only one who thinks whistles could be dirty??), it just didn't seem like a $20 value. Tell me I'm wrong maybe, enlighten me please, I will probably return but only if friends or family are ready to go and can afford it.

A LAST MINUTE addition: I was ready to give this place a 3-star review, but I paused for a second and thought \"I wonder what people who work there think of their job experience?\" So I pulled up Five Guys on Indeed and they are a fairly high rated employer. Most associates seem happy with pay and benefits, and if you can get the mass of your employees to say that they're content flipping burgers all day then you must be paying well. So while I stand by the rest of my review, I do believe that employers that treat their employees fairly and can compete with national brands is deserving of merit, even if they have to charge a more premium price. Good on you Five Guys!"}
{"text":"This is the place to get a good hardy burger. Their little hamburger is not little at all !! However, the little burger is probably priced at the same price of a regular burger. 
The fries can also get a bit greasy at times."}
{"text":"Half a mile from our house - we frequent Five Guys often. And they have never messed up our order! We love it here. They welcome you the second you walk in the door. The staff are friendly and always seem to be having fun while they work. They ask how your day is going and actually seem to care. That makes the experience so much better. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Five Guys is about as good as you can expect a fast food burger chain to be. This place has some very redeeming qualities but also has some pitfalls that are preventing it from being exceptional. 

The good: 
- Everything is cooked fresh to order, burgers are customizable, burgers appear to be fresh not frozen
- All toppings are free including grilled mushrooms and onions 
- Portion size is huge, a regular burger comes with 2 patties (you can order a single patty but you have to specify it, the norm is a double) topped with as many toppings as you like
- A regular order of fries means you will get a regular cup full of fries then your bag will be filled to the brim with more fries. A regular order of fries should be sufficient to share between two people (provided one of those people isn't me, I ate the whole order myself)
- The fries are fresh cut, thick and very delicious. You also have the option of Cajun fries which have a nice seasoning that has a bit of a kick, definitely go for these. 
- The burgers are cooked on a flat top which gives the a nice crispy crust on the outside
- The open kitchen allows you to see your meal being prepared
- They have complimentary peanuts 
- They use potatoes from PEI and even have a sign up telling you where that day's potatoes are from. 

The not so good
- Although you get a double patty with your burgers the patties are quite thin and if you load up your burger with toppings (as I like to do) the taste of the thin patty can get lost. All burgers cooked to well done which means they will not be at their optimal juiciness. 
- Processed cheese on my burger was not melted, I hate processed cheese! 
- The price tag is quite high, my regular cheeseburger and regular fries ran about $13 tax in (with no drink), this is a little more than I am comfortable spending on a fast food burger
- They use peanut oil to fry everything, there are big sacks of complimentary peanuts, and the floors have peanut shells all over, so if you have a peanut allergy this place is not an option for you

As for the restaurant itself, it is fairly new with the trademark five guys d√©cor which consists of red and white tiling all over the walls. The service was very good, my order was taken promptly and I got my food in about 10 minutes, my food was cooked to order hence the wait. Overall five guys dishes out probably the best fast food chain burger you can have but that still doesn't justify the price IMO, for $13 I could have gotten TWO meals elsewhere! It is definitely worth a try but I would not frequent this place often."}
{"text":"From 6/17/16
Came here for a quick bite to eat. This Five Guys is on West Lake Mead Blvd next to the plaza with the Whole Foods. Got our orders, and it was your typical Five Guys burger and fries, by usual I mean tasty! No complaints here."}
{"text":"I love the food here, is it better than In n Out?  Not so sure.  The burgers are definitely fresh and delish.  I got a regular burger and fries and holy moly was it alot of food!  I think the little burger would have been fine and I could have easily split one order of fries with my two boys.  They fill up the cup of fries, which is a good size and then dump more into the bag!  I took off one half of a star because of the price, I thought it was pretty pricey for fast food.  I also took off one quarter of a star for the loudness, I couldn't even hear myself think in there because the music was so loud.  They lose another quarter of a star because they do not offer kids meals.  Now that I know portion size though, I can order more appropriately because we had a bunch of food leftover on our first visit here.  All of the employees are super nice and quick so all around I really like this place and would return."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since I've had a 5 guys burger but it left a lasting impression that I knew I had to come back and I was not disappointed . The actual quality of the burger meat is what I like you can taste it. They where also kind enough give me some free spicy fries while I waited first time I got fries didn't care for them and is why I don't order them but I enjoyed the spicy fries very much. For a pure burger this is the place. But if you want to take it up a notch All American burger and grille in the rio is a must try. Also I must say smash burger is a close 2nd to 5 guys. Location in clean and staff friendly"}
{"text":"I haven't been in this location before. We were craving some meat, and after a delay for lunch with the girls. There was high energy right when we came through the the door with no line. We were ready to eat some 100% burgers. I ordered a burger (which is 2 patties) with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and barbecue sauce with a large cajun fries and a drink. Make no mistake, there is a big difference between the little burger and the big burger -- so be prepared! 

They have the drink machines that you can have like 100 different drink options. I went for the classic barq's rootbeer. As always, they have an all you can feast peanut buffet. 

They got my order and it was delicious.  At that point I was so hungry that I didn't realize until a few bites in that they had forgotten my barbecue sauce. If it was not for that, I would have given them 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place made me feel like Homer Simpson when he floats following a smell with the eyes semi open. 

While in the roof top parking of this plaza I couldn't kill the craving for fries, the smell of guilt was really strong, but I didn't know the devious place was Five Guys Burgers.

I just wanted fries, but when I went inside I thought a hocho would help me cushion the coming spirits, so I ordered a $4 bucks sausage. 

To be honest, I rather pay $3 bucks in a hot dog stand on the street (where I can pick the nationality of the wiener according to my cravings), because the quality, flavor, size&thickness of their sausage (jeje) wasn't worth the extra buck.

However, if we speak about fries, they do know how to make those, oh yeah. Really crispy, meaty, well seasoned and good looking... I went there for their smell and I don't regret them; just thinking about them makes me salivate."}
{"text":"Five Guys has solid food. I love the topping options and the Cajun fries. Just an FYI... The regular size fries is definitely enough for 2 people. The food is always fresh and priced reasonably. Pro tip: You can ask to have the jalapenos grilled if you don't want them fresh."}
{"text":"Our visit was due to a gift card I was gifted. So we had been here previously so we knew what we were walking into. Free peanuts as soon as you walk in, all that you can grab basically. Than the menu is almost like In n Out, order either a burger, burger with cheese, bacon burger, or bacon burger with cheese. And you can have them 'little' size for the kiddies. And they have hotdogs too, with or without bacon.
So the food was good, the fries were the best part I gotta say! Last time we had Cajun fries and they were way over seasoned. But the best part, which I forgot they did, was they put loads of extra  in the bottom of you bag!! We should have only ordered two fries instead of three, because we ended up taking some home anyway because there was so many. 
The coke machine is the one where you can add flavor, so I got to enjoy Vanilla Coke with my meal. 
By the way, the employees were extremely nice. Made sure to say hello and good bye and helped us even order as well. I suggest adding grilled onions to anything you eat there, they are SSSSOOOOO GGGOOOOOOOOOODDDDD!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food reasonable prices as always. Place is clean and comfortable.  The staff at this location is over the top awesome. Never seen a better team. Friendly helpful and make your experience absolutely great everytime! I keep going back more for wonderful experience with the staff than any other reason. Can't for the shake either, as they are on point."}
{"text":"This is a Five Guys like any other Five Guys...which is a good thing. If you're craving a quick burger and in the area, Five Guys is tough to beat. The burgers are indeed delicious (and surprisingly filling), with a genuine \"freshly-made\" quality about them. And, if you order the fries, expect mounds (and MOUNDS) of them. They don't really have a \"small\" fries; in actuality there's really either XL or XXL. Go small.

I've been to this location a few times, and it's always clean and staffed with friendly people. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a quick bite downtown."}
{"text":"Sort of fast food, but fresher...and a little more tasty.

Things to know:
  -When you order a Cheeseburger, it's automatically a double patty. If you want something smaller (a single), order a \"Little Cheeseburger.\"
 -Contrary to how small the cup looks, a Regular fries will definitely feed 2 people because they dump all kinds of extra fries in the bag too.
  -The burgers are MESSY...but I kind of liked it. They were messy-good.

Overall, Five Guys is solid. I enjoyed my burger, and the fries were done well too. However, I still can't see myself going out of my way to return very often."}
{"text":"I love everything five guys !! Yes it's a new location but I'm so glad they opened up. My new favorite burger spot for lunch. Been here twice and the food is good. Little burger fries and drink. Of course expect to pay $12-$16 for lunch. But you get what you pay for ... Deliciousness !! I still need to try their milkshakes. But will definitely be back. I wish they would be a little faster but I think they are typical time for a five guys location."}
{"text":"Decent burgers here, there not quite as fresh as in n out is but good nonetheless. I guess its cause the meat comes from back east is why the quality isn't as good but it's not one of my favorite places to stop in. My girlfriend seems to like it so I do my best."}
{"text":"This place was slow but really friendly. They took care of us and the food was good. My family was full and happy. But it was a little much with the fries. All an all OK"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger but the price is a little high. Don't like that everything is separate and not in a meal. The fries are so good! 

The cashier was super nice! She gave us water cups even though we said no and she also hooked my bf up with a double patty burger!"}
{"text":"Eaten at Five Guys Ocean to Ocean. This was not my usual five guys experience. The burger was off the bun when I opened the wrap. Probably because it was drenched in mustard. The cheese was half way off the meat. To add insult to injury, the burger was thin, overcooked and crunchy. 

Sloppy sloppy sloppy! Will be going to other locals in Charlotte for my regular Five Guys fix. One added note is you can't eat outside because your hair will smell like a charcoal grill from the smoke at restaurant next door."}
{"text":"The hamburgers here are really good, and the french fries here are really good.  The combination of fresh cut fries and the burger is pretty good. The selection of toppings is fun to play with. However, it's really overpriced, and I don't think they provide a product which is worth the amount that you spend here."}
{"text":"Why? Why? Why must you greet me at the door with this scent? It's like you just know you shouldn't, but you're gonna. And you're gonna do it big (because that's how they do it here). And you're not even going to feel bad about it. Let's get real. NOBODY come to Five Guys for a salad. And NOBODY feels ashamed of their meal when they leave. Everyone is rubbing their happy bellies & is eagerly awaiting a nap."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while looking for the CVS. I am not prone to go for a burger joint, but it was late and I was hungry. 

I ended up ordering the grilled cheese. What?! At a burger joint? Yes, I know. I also ordered the fries -- the Cajun fries. 

Five Guys is very generous with their fries. Like, seriously. Which is kind of nice because after eating the serving from the designated cup, I still had some at the bottom of the bag. Ah, bliss. 

The Cajun spice was nice -- and not at all overdone. These are not the type of fries that cause your lips to curl into your mouth. Not salty, but spice-filled. But not hot, for those of you concerned about too-spicy food. 

But this is the kind of food that leaves you feeling guilty after eating it -- but not in that slimy, greasy kind of way. Just in the overindulgent kind of way. Maybe it was the fries. 

The grilled cheese was nicely...well, grilled. And there was a hint of something I could not figure out. Something slightly sweet either in the cheese or in the sourdough. I couldn't figure it out. It wasn't like straight sugar -- maybe cane sugar or brown sugar slipped into the dough? Very tasty. But, funny: The sandwich was rather small. Smaller than a fist. But, all the same, it was delicious and, along with the fries, quite filling."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of this place.  I think it may be for the fact that they use sweet pickles on the burgers.  Also I didnt care for there barbecue sauce.  I like other burger joints for the value.  This place if expensive"}
{"text":"So stopped here on way home from holidays...being celiac I eat GF so got my  burger on a lettuce wrap!!!  Delicious 
The fries are fresh and crispy!"}
{"text":"The first time I came to this area their service was fast and the staff was friendly. The second time I came, they got my order wrong twice. I asked for a little cheeseburger with no grilled mushrooms. I peeked inside my order and to my surprise there were a whole bunch of mushrooms stuffed in there. So they offered to make me a new one. The second time I got my order, they forgot my sauce. So I just decided to eat it and forget about it. But what bothered me was that the place was so slow yet, they were rushing every food and order. Highly disappointed in this location."}
{"text":"So I was pretty excited about this burger joint opening since it's President Obama's favorite... 
The burger was good. Not great, not bland, just okay. My biggest hang up with this restaurant are the prices! Skip the beverage... it's very over priced. I was also not impressed with the fries- regular or cajun. They were pretty average as well. Stick with the burger and skip the rest is my suggestion to you."}
{"text":"Had a burger and fries and was very disappointed after paying $15 for lunch.   burger was very average and the fries were actually bad.   wont be back as for that price I should be blown away."}
{"text":"Great fast and deliciius burgers, fries, shakes and more. Lots if flavored lemondes and a vegee, blt and grilled cheese option too! Priced average and the peanuts are free and fun!"}
{"text":"Restaurant gets an A+ the food however gets a C. Burger quality while tasty, and topping selection was superb. The burgers overall quality just doesn't deliver that experience you would expect from a burger. And at the price they are asking, they shouldn't be giving a C burger"}
{"text":"I don't allow a bad experience to turn me against a restaurant,in that spirit I decided to put aside my 2014 experience and return. The burger while richly done did not come on a Saugy bun, nor where the patties falling apart. I think it is helpful to note the restaurant was not busy this time as compared to the last. Staff where friendly, restaurant was clean food was hot. This restaurant will hopefully force the McDonald's down the street to hire better management."}
{"text":"Decent burgers, I was happy they do burgers on a lettuce wrap! Quick service. They initially got my order wrong and they re-made it with no fuss, gave me the old one, and extra fries as an apology. Very friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Meh. Not bad. Not the best.  Burgers and everything are just too greasy. I would take In-n-Out over 5 guys as the same class of hamburger.  However, not everyone has both."}
{"text":"They gave us food that other people opened, touched & gave back!!

The people next to us opened their bag, took out the food, opened the burgers, took out the fries & realized this was NOT their order. They returned it. Guess what??? Our # was called next & the server actually barely wrapped up the food & put it into the bag & tried to give it to us!!! Wow really??? Can't see going back & I can't trust the employees serving the food! 
Good burger. Fries soggy. Root beer tasted off. Might have been better to wait a week, & better train the staff more THEN open? Just saying"}
{"text":"Thank God they have carry-out because I couldn't wait to get out of there. I don't get what's up with the weird way the employees yell the orders back and forth. It was excessively loud, irritating and completely unnecessary. Maybe the point is to drive your customers out the door as quickly as possible. If so, it worked perfectly.

As for the food, it was tasty and well-prepared, if a tad overpriced. But it in no way compensated for the verbal assault I just endured. Once was more than enough. If I feel the need for a burger again, In N Out is friendly and spares my nerves."}
{"text":"I love the burgers and fries! One of the best burger shop I know of. They always give us a lot of fries. Yum."}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars I would .......came in to eat but first wanted to use the bathroom .....when I tried to open the door it was locked ......I walked to the counter to ask if keys where needed the girl behind the counter was very quick to tell me the BR was for customers only. .....with a very sour look on her face ...I'm hoping it wasn't because I'm Hispanic although it seemed that way .....hope this review will stop anyone from going there ...ps we walked right out"}
{"text":"PROS:
1. Cheap food. Free peanuts! :) 

2. Casual, fun environment. Great place to relax and eat. I'm surprised they don't serve beer...

CONS:
1. No vegetarian options.

OVERALL:
-Great place for meat eaters. p.s. free drink refills!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by stating that I am a bit of a health food nut, but I will rate this place for what it is, a burger chain.

This place is awesome! I always get the regular burger (2 patties) with all the raw toppings and condiments. It tastes amazing every single time. The fries are fresh cut and taste good even if you let them get cold.

This place makes the best \"fast food\" burgers around!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I would have never called ahead of time if I thought it would have taken more than 25 minutes! The manager, who can barely speak appropriately gave me a bs excuse on why...but the guy in front of me and after me got their food. WOW"}
{"text":"American style burgers are not easy to find in Canada.  If you're craving for one, you will not go wrong at Five Guys!  The single cheese burger is a perfect working dinner.  While you wait, there are complimentary fresh shelled peanuts. Something I've never seen at a burger joint.  And that's because the company started in Virginia.  According to Wikipedia they're the largest growing franchise business."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The staff is always incredibly nice and go out of their way to talk to their customers and smile! The fries are fresh cut everyday and the burgers are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Well to start, I go here for the free peanuts I have to say. They give you all you can eat, fresh roasted, in the shell, like dodger stadium baseball peanuts! They are so good, I usually fill up on those first. Then I get my juicy burger so you know if you order a regular burger here it's a double. So you have to order a \"little\" burger and that is one patty, get a \"little\" fry -- that is your average burger and fries and it's not small. Get the CAJUN FRIES :) super good"}
{"text":"This downtown location is almost always busy.  In a very nice corner of a nice new shopping/dining/pedestrian mall.  Outside seating nice, inside is nice.  It's new, so shiny, bright, clean.

I live two blocks way, and dine here about once a week.  A regular double cheeseburger with back and \"all the way\" topings and regular fries will feed two modestly hungry people, say a skinny woman and man, with fries to spare.   $12.  Get two regular burgers and fries, add 3 or 4 bucks, and you've got a rich meal.  

The burgers are great for fast food.  Better than in n out, better than any other fast food burger.  Fries are $2.50 but they serve like the equivalent of 2-3 extra large McDonalds fries portions, so it feeds me, the wife, and two small kids and we are stuffed.  

They serve peanuts in the shell for a fun, messy way to pass the time waiting for the burgers to cook, and you can easily wait 10-15 minutes for your food to be ready.  

Overally, the only negative is that these guys make such huge margins... charging $12 for a burger and fries in a fast food setting feels like highway robbery.

They get away with it because the quality is outstanding.  

But honestly, I could get a better burger and fries, for about the same price, at a great restaurant.  

So you be the judge.  If you are a quality over quantity person in terms of bang for your buck, then come here and endulge.  But this would be an expensive lunch habit if you work downtown and eat here often.

Of course you'd likely drop dead from a coronary far before you went broke.

And for the love of god don't order online.  They just hold your order until you arrive, as people have complained otherwise that the fries aren't fresh.  It maybe saves 5 minutes off the process, and of course waiting in line, but unless you are going during lunch rush hour, just head down there with a book or a companion."}
{"text":"I would have given five stars if only they had CHEESE SAUCE for the fries or even ranch.  I honestly have talked to a number of people who think cheese sauce or ranch for the fries would make a HUGE difference.  I hope they will think about adding this to the menu.  :)  The burgers are great and I love the fact that they are made with fresh ground meat and not frozen.  It's like home but even better!!  I love the selection of toppings too for the burgers."}
{"text":"Is it expensive? Yes. Is the bag of fries usually wet with grease at the bottom? Absolutely. Is there a wait for your food? Of course. Is it busy? During meal times it is extremely busy. But I will keep coming back. To me, it's worth the money. The first time I ever went, when I bit into that burger, it was the closest thing to having burgers home on the grill that I had had in decades. I love the many toppings you can get on your burger for free. I love the way that the crew joke around with each other while they're cooking your burgers. I love the peanuts while I am waiting. I do not mind waiting one bit to have my burger custom made. I would rather do that than eat plastic tasting burgers that has been sitting under a hot light at a fast food place. Their iced tea is brewed perfectly, & I can choose between sweet or unsweet. I happen to like my fries a little bit on the limp side, I have to admit. If I want crispy fries, I will go to Wendys or McDonalds. And while I love all the toppings, to me I want to taste the meat. I do not want my meat smothered with special sauce so that I can't even taste the meat. So I am very happy to have the two patties on my burger. I don't eat there often, because of the price, but it is a treat for me when I feel like spoiling myself ."}
{"text":"It's a newish Five Guys location offering it's regular fares including poutine. We got the typical massive cheeseburger you find at FG. What was a pleasant surprise was the beef gravy poutine made just right, not too salty and a mouthful of tastylicious cheesy goodness.

Will come here again once we replenish our coffins o.0"}
{"text":"Preston and Zane are the best at customer service I am very impressed with the professionalism they portrayed today! They will make great leads and managers soon! My order was wrong last night and they explained how five guys prides themselves in making sure you are more than satisfied! Just in shock! I hope this gets relayed to them!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. This place isn't for everyone and, no, it isn't as good as In-N-Out. Don't come in expecting gourmet burgers because you won't get any. What you will get are standard burgers  -- the kind you get from a backyard barbeque -- that are prepared excellently with mostly fresh ingredients. It's more pricey than fast food places, but I'd choose 5 Guys over any of those other places any day."}
{"text":"Good food, decent service however the music is so dang loud it's hard to hear the company you keep at the table!"}
{"text":"5 guys Burgers and Fries. If you are unaware of 5 guys then you have been living on mars, in a cave with your eyes shut. I could argue that I find it the best burger place in town. The service is courteous, the place is clean, ordering is easy and free peanuts are a bonus. We ordered and sat down and the guy behind the counter brought our food to us, something that usually doesn't happen in a burger joint. 
If you have never been to 5 guys, you are missing out. Might I recommended go on youtube and watch \"dyamdrops 5 guys burgers and fries review\" for inspiration."}
{"text":"Yah, it's PFG!

Finally made it to Five Guys just a few weeks ago. Been there a couple times now. The burgers and especially the fries are damn good. The fries are double fried so they are super crispy and they give you A LOT. Seriously, the small is perfect for two people. The burgers aren't anything too horribly special... basic buns, average size and taste. But I love how you can totally customize the toppings and literally get whatever you want on top. 

Wayyyyyy better than some crappy fast food joint, but you WILL pay for it. Don't expect a dollar menu here. Oh, and if you have a peanut allergy, STAY AWAY. There's peanuts everywhere!"}
{"text":"I've been to better burger stores compared to Five Guys.
Love the freshness of its contents but the taste is meh.
Love how they give out peanuts for free though."}
{"text":"So I haven't been here for a couple of years because the food really isn't healthy in any way. But I wanted a burger and the line at Wendy's was out the door. I should have stood in line there. 

Five Guys was noisy, the tables were not cleaned, the fries were merely warm, and the burger was over done as in hard, and the bun was wet from lettuce that wasn't dried. 

Never again folks, never again."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and fries! Fast service! Love the atmosphere. Although it can get really hot inside at times but I don't mind coming back over and over again!!"}
{"text":"I believe when you're extremely hungry, best thing to have is a delicious burger. That's what we had at Five Guys. The burger was so fresh, it almost burned my tongue! Every thing tasted great and the restaurant is clean and well kept. I don't know about the other branches, but this one had non-greasy burgers. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I come here just for the Cajun fries.  The burger is meh, but I gotta say the fresh jalapenos as a topping is great.  I really wish burgers priest had a location around here."}
{"text":"I just love this place 
I think it's the best burger by far 
They make very good and full in good flavors 
Every time I read the bad reviews about this place it's make me sick 
The best burger in America always been and will stay like that"}
{"text":"Everything that good about a burger you can say about them 
So juicy so Fresh so good 
Everytime I see five guys I wonder if I should stop or not bc I know I will order everything 
The Cajun fries and all black burger are the best 
You can always have some snacks on the way too 
Great team work and a very clean place 
The best burger in America by far"}
{"text":"Yup, same chain as everywhere. A greasy burger that takes to long to make, and terrible fries that are either plain or doused in a terrible mix of seasoning salt. Only good thing is you can eat shelled peanuts while you wait for food"}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in the door I new it was going to be a great experience. Everyone was really nice attentive friendly, and in the most genuine way possible. The restaurant was clean the service was prompt. The young lady Khiara that was preparing the food was definitely a stand out employee and set the tone for the other employees. So glad I came here and will by pass the location closer to my house to come back."}
{"text":"I arrived at the store at 9:53, only to find the doors locked and the crew mopping and cleaning the grill. The store was closed earlier than the advertised closing time of 10pm. I'm not sure exactly what time the doors were locked but it had to have been well before I arrived as the guy mopping had covered most all of the store. I understand wanting to get a head start on closing duties but to actually lock customers out  before closing time just seems like bad business."}
{"text":"You've gotta be insane to eat a burger there. The restaurant looks dirty, it's expensive for what it worths (15 $ for cheese and fries) and there's nothing to recycle (a lot of garbages)."}
{"text":"It's heeeerreee! Midwooders rejoice, Five Guys has finally opened next to the Healthy Home Market (the humor of this is not lost on me). 

It like most other five guys except this is the first one I've seen with milkshakes, newer furniture and they have an exposed brick wall that's pretty cool. 

Pros - reliable good food, best fries around and really friendly staff. The person who made my burger brought out the BBQ sauce since he realized he forgot to include it on my burger. The cashier walked out my receipt since she wasn't sure how to print it for web orders. 

Cons - there was a LOT of shouting, more than the usual store. The floor needing sweeping badly and there were a LOT of people working/training. The web order really saved me no time as opposed to ordering there. 

Will be back for sure, though will have to balance with my local fav - Bang Bang burgers on 7th."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries here. Nice big portions, juicy burgers, and great taste. No gimmicks, just a great meal. Everything is made fresh for you. Love it!"}
{"text":"I must preface this review by saying I am not a fan of the burgers here, so I came here with the intent of trying something different.

This location is similar to every Five Guys you've ever been to, peanuts when you walk in and praise for the place all over the walls. I ordered a Kosher bacon dog (the dog itself was Kosher) with mustard and onions, with fries.

I must say that this was one of the best hot dogs I've had in a very long time. I'm surprised that this dog was so good given that I 1) got it at Five Guys and 2) got it at a chain restaurant. I must say the dogs are 100x better than the burgers. The staff at this location is super friendly as well!"}
{"text":"great great cheeseburger. If you are a fan of french fries they will LOAD you up. the line might be long - but does move quick"}
{"text":"Une exp√©rience am√©ricaine fast-food! 
La vitesse √† laquelle tout se passe est divertissante ! La cuisine qui est sous nos yeux nous permet de voir le feu de l'action. Si vous avez envie d'un hamburger et d'une bonne frite c'est la place par excellence !

P. S. Les tables se font rare sur l'heure du d√Æner du √† l'achalandage donc gardez l'¬úil ouvert !"}
{"text":"Ummm okay so this is the most amazing, yummy, place for burgers. If you have never eaten a burger here you will bite into your perfectly made meal, put it down, and tell your friend through garbled words that it's the best burger you've ever had. 

Everything is fresh and they offer a ton of toppings. You can get regular fries or cajun flavored. I find Cajun flavored a must since you can't get it anywhere else and the regular frieds are kind of plain, although they are seasoned with salt. 

Only problem is this food is really, really high in calories (duh) but it's worth it. Just don't eat and feel guilty about it. Enjoy it.

If you don't want a burger they do have hot dogs and grilled cheese. Both look good. Also, the way the soda machine words is cool and the soda tastes really delicious. 

Service is great. I've walked in at 9:50 starving and apologizing for coming in so late and the staff reassured me I was fine. That says something -- although what exactly I couldn't tell you.

There menu is basic and they don't have milkshakes. Some think it's expensive and it is for a \"fast food burger\" -- like $6.00 before drinks or fries -- but the quality is the cause for the price difference."}
{"text":"the staff here are soooo nice and they have the best burgers better than in and out, the place is super clean too"}
{"text":"I haven't been to 5 Guys for several years. I tried the cheese dog today and it was excellent. They split it, then it hits the flat top and then the cheese gets meted on the dog. Mustard, onions, and pickles to top it off. Nice lunch for the day, now it's back to work. This location is right off I - 271 in Warrensville  Heights so it's very convenient if you're on the go."}
{"text":"Their menu is very simple. Pick your burger, hot dog, or sandwich. Then you can pick as many free toppings you want on your selected item. Technically it's not free since you gotta pay for your selection. But then again, you don't pay extra if you decide to have them put ALL the toppings in your burger. This is where I have to actually stop and think about the value of my choice. Yes I actually had them put ALL the toppings on my burger. This is good or bad depending on how you look at it. GOOD: Definitely got value for my money. Filled me up. You get to taste how every single topping is put together and based on that, you get to experiment how certain toppings can blend better than others. BAD: Very messy. As soon as you take that first bite, you may have some or all toppings come falling out (to me, a messy burger is a good sign of enough ingredients to keep your tastebuds on your toes). Obviously I wouldn't recommend you eating this in your car even if you are parked. You might get heartburn if you have a weak stomach. 

Now as for the pricing, I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with everything. It cost about 6 dollars and some change. Not bad. Of course you gotta have some of their fries and a drink to wash it down with. So total for my whole meal was about 13 something. Definitely just a tad more than In n Out which for some reason is the other burger joint that everybody is comparing it to. 

Their fries alone are pretty tasty. Pretty greasy but good. I have yet to see fries that are baked or grilled taste any better. Now if you do get the fries, they have two sizes. Small and large. The small in itself is a nice size so if you wanna share that you can't go wrong. What I don't understand is why anyone would not order their fries cajun. The fries are already good by themselves but damn, having them sprinkle the cajun spices on your fries is like putting ice cream and hot fudge on a brownie. It's that much better! I'm sure you have heard the term, \"Put a little spice in your life\". Well, the cajun fries are just that! 

Their coke machine is not just any soda machine. It's what every fast food restaurant should have! So many choices of beverages and even some you never heard of! I think after this review I will contact the Coke company and demand this as the norm for every fast food joint they are in. 

Oh, did I mention the free peanuts you can eat while you are waiting for your order? I guess if you really wanna be stingy, you can just order a burger and ask a cup for water. Then fill up on the peanuts! I have actually seen somebody do this so if you wanna save money than by all means!

So overall, with their good service you will have a pretty good experience. Just be prepared to spend a little more than you're used to especially if you are feeding a family of 4 or more. For more info especially for a list of all the toppings you can have, go to their website, www.fiveguys.com

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"If  you noticed, 5 Guys jumped up a star. I really have to say that I prefer their burgers over In-N-Out. I think they are juicier and I can get bacon on them. Bacon is the meat candy. Bacon makes everything better. Also I just like their fries better. I could eat a ton of their fries, which is basically what they give you. Still a little miffed that they don't have milkshakes. The last time we ordered as it was take out to avoid the music.  Maybe someday I might try a hot dog or grilled cheese."}
{"text":"I go for the peanuts I tell the guy LOL I do I can't get enough of the salted, in the shell, roasted, dodger stadium style free peanuts! The burgers are great, juicy and any/all toppings you want to add. The fries are great they are kind of like small steak fries, they have like mashed tatoes inside and lightly salted they are SO good dipped in ketchup. I like this place all the employees interact with you, making sure you're having a good meal. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm 6.5 months pregnant and asked for a bigger water and she said \"no, that's the only size we have. Unless you want to buy a soda\". 
Seriously rude. And to top it off she said \"ok, have a nice day\". To a thirsty pregnant women who's   who just ate their fries. Sorry but their French fries are not worth the rudeness."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries!! This is one of the best places to get a great burger!!"}
{"text":"I first ate at a Five Guys in Washington and was excited to see them come to Canada. After my first visit I'm very disappointed with it. 

I ordered a cheeseburger, with a side of fries and a soft drink. What does the cashier do? Charge me for a large fries and drink. Didn't give me an option to choose the size.  This brought it to a grand total of $17! $17 for a fast food burger? No thank you.

As for the burger...was good. Not great, but better than any other fast food chain. I would eat here again, if not for the broken trust caused by the cashier upsizing my sides without asking."}
{"text":"Freshly made to order hamburgers and hotdogs! I had one with cheese and bacon. It was cooked perfect. The fries are hand cut and full of flavor. They have one of those multiple selection beverage machines there with 50+ varieties. Good service, short wait for order. The place was clean. A school was doing a fundraiser there tonight, so they're good for the community too!"}
{"text":"Best fast burger on the planet! The other local joints can't hold a candle to this place! Fresh jalepenos make the burger!!! The only thing they lack is chili"}
{"text":"I love Five Guys Burgers - if you've never had it, definitely try it! The only reason it is getting 4 stars is because I've had it in Chicago and it was so much better there. I don't know what the difference was. Also - they didn't tell me that it was a double cheeseburger - I only like a single patty and mine came with two. Otherwise, still pretty delicious! Beware the fries, though. The smallest order can easily be split between two people!!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Great burger with all the fixins. Extremely fresh ingredients. Fries are awesome (cajun style, I gair-aun-tee). I have had a lot of different fast food chain burgers but this tops them all. Fatburger is very good, Fuddruckers is good, but really people? Comparing this place to In-N-Out is just silly. Way better at 5 Guys and yes you pay more but its worth it. The soda machine a lot of people complain here about is awesome. They do one thing and they do it extremely well. I will return as much as possible barring a change in pants size."}
{"text":"A good place if you want a decent burger. Wouldn't say it is the best burger I have ever had, however, it is tasty and hearty and the veggies (lettuce, tomato, etc) always taste fresh. I like that large amount of toppings to choose from. Prices are decent for what you get. A tip: I have heard that their regular burgers are huge so I always order the Jr burger and its more than enough. Also, the smalls fries are basically like a large at most other places so i don't even wanna picture what the large looks like. Atmosphere is clean and service is pretty quick. Like I said, a decent place for a burger in this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Banana, peanut Butter and BACON milkshake. That's it. Why are you still reading? Go. Now!

Ok, I'll elaborate a little bit... So far, this is the only Five Guys in the city that does milk shakes, and they've made sure to get them so right. What's the first thing that pops into your head when I say \"Calgary Milkshake\"? Peter's, right? What's the best, but also the worst thing about a Peter's Milkshake? They're SO thick. You've either got to wait half an hour to drink it as soup, or suck so hard your cheeks touch in the middle. Five Guys gives you a shake that manages to be every bit as thick and creamy, but you're still able to suck it through the straw. Don't ask me how they did it, but they did.

They use fresh fruit. The Salted Caramel is off the hook. You can upgrade any smoothie with real bacon. The burgers are fresh and handmade using Alberta beef. I could go on, but I'm not going to. The rest you should already know: It's the classic American Burger joint that uses local wherever possible. They're hardcore into the red and white checker print and you can eat peanuts in the line up. But you know all of this, and you've heard enough - now it's time to go for a milkshake."}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries. Better than fast food. I forgot how good the burgers were here."}
{"text":"I have no idea what the fuss is all about. I tried 5 Guys for the first time today, and as a burger connoisseur I was excited. 

The place was dumpy with the cheapest of furniture and not too clean. 

The burger (two patties) was way way overcooked and so incredibly dry. The bun hardly covered the burger. I will say the toppings were really nice. I also wasn't impressed by the patty size, smaller than any other gourmet burger joint, making it hard to cook the meat anything but overdone. The cheese is processed which says too much about this places lack of commitment to providing a true quality product all around. 


Service was fast and friendly, but I won't be returning and can recommend a half dozen better Gourmet Burger joints in the GTA."}
{"text":"Ok, so the burgers are good.  They are fantastic but they are so expensive.  If you love getting more than two toppings then the money is worth it.  

Their fries are delicious but there is no small size.  This place is where people with big appetites go to eat.  This is not a place for a dainty eater.  

The feeling of the restaurant is simple, sparse.  There is no need for anything flashy.  I want to give this four stars but I am just so bored with it.  It was new and fun 3 years ago, now it needs something new.  Just one new thing on the menu.  

Give me more 5 guys."}
{"text":"I'm not sure the exact reason why I'm craving to go back right now. Maybe it was the burger to bun ratio? Maybe it was the make your own burger concept with the toppings? Maybe it was those delicious perfectly cooked Cajun fries? Or maybe it was the peanuts.  I do know I will be back because I missed out on a shake!  In any case for a burger joint it gets my five stars for flavor, freshness and fast service.  Perfect for a cheat day or cure a hangover!"}
{"text":"Can I just say that around 2 pm today the lovely lady taking orders was just the sweetest, nicest ladies ever. I love this place because the burgers and Cajun fries are the bomb but the customer service is what keeps bringing me back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is always good and the food is always great. Minus the music sometimes being a HAIR too loud -- but whatever makes their days go by faster. And in their defense it is located on State St so I'm sure a lot of customers consider louder music a norm for many establishments in that specific area."}
{"text":"I recently ate here for the 2nd time.  I was disappointed that my burger came to me with grilled onions instead of the grilled mushrooms that I ordered.  I blame the music that is too loud to allow proper comunication in the order taking.  Additioanally our order of french fries was missed completely, but at least they made up for that by giving us french fries for free later.  Good food, but not great, especially for the prices."}
{"text":"Terrible! Anyone can make better burgers and fries at home than this overpriced garbage soaked with peanut oil!"}
{"text":"Decent burger good fries but eat them while they're hot because it's not as good cold or when they're soggy (they wrap their burgers in foil). They make your order fresh so while you wait grab a bunch of complimentary salted peanuts to stave off your hunger in the meantime."}
{"text":"Lets get the bad out of the way first, the prices. They seem to be pretty expensive for a burger joint. With that being said I love the food! Burgers are the best!! Love the fried too!!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent burger joint with an amazing crew!! We had an issue the 1st time we are here, John made it right, and with a great attitude. It wasn't like pulling teeth, just very pleasant. Nate helped us today and he too was a nice guy. Got the order right!  Again, a pleasant experience and super food!!! I highly recommend the Cajun fries."}
{"text":"The menu here is pretty basic and exactly what you'd expect from the name, burgers and fries. They also have hot dogs on the menu and that's about it. The burgers are really good. The basic burger is a double patty, if you want a single you should order the \"little\" version. The french fry portions are big so good thing the fries here are delicious."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in and each had a Jr burger and shared a regular fry.  Burgers were definitely higher quality than your typical fast food place, but it's the fires that make it worth coming back for.  Although the cost of the meal was higher than expected for a quasi fast food joint, and the interior looked like a take on In N Out Burger, we'd definitely eat there again.  Props for having malt vinegar next to the ketchup."}
{"text":"The staff at this location is so nice! Just like how they approached the table to check on us - even as we left they offered a free bag of fries to go. The burger/fries was great although, I didn't give it a perfect score because at this time I am not sure if it's like the best even you know? It was just simply good and that made me smile ;) oh ya and they give you peanuts to eat while you wait and it seems like you can throw the shells on the ground too but when I did my roommate got all freaked out because there we not other shells on the ground - so what is it? Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I love to come to the Summerlin location. Staff is always friendly and today we had 1 singer and dancer in the staff LOL. They entertained us tonight :)
craving for a good costumed juicy burger or hot dog (didn't now they offered hot dog...) 5 guys is the place.
You will choose the ingredients / sauce you like and order your own burger!
their fries are good!! and they always tell you daily from where their potato are from :)

my favorite burger is
cheese burger with mayo ketchup mustard
onions jalape√±o tomato lettuce & pickles

While you wait for your burger you can snack on roasted peanuts!
Bon app√©tit"}
{"text":"Okay burgers. Unlimited toppings for no extra charge.  Awesome fries. Cool soda machine."}
{"text":"I went to Five Guys in South Common mall a few years back and hated it.  Fries were bland, burger was plain and meat wasn't fresh or hot.  Maybe it's because they just opened and were working out the kinks, but this experience here was much better.

Fries were crispy, greasy and salty - so they were great. Cheeseburger had fresh ground beef and really good \"bad cheese\".  

Only thing I don't like is that they don't have combos, so kind of pricey."}
{"text":"Love there burgers and great service,  the only thing i hate is that the burger is gone in 2 minutes"}
{"text":"Took our friend Roger to 5 Guys toward the outlet near Blue Diamond.
He had a great experience!
As soon we walked in I heard \"Good evening welcome to 5 Guys\"! What an entrance lol
The Manager took our order. He was very lovely, bubbly and truly customer oriented. While the guys made up there mind I was ordering my bacon cheeseburger with onions, lettuce, jalape√±o, tomato, mayonnaise (the french inside me), ketchup and mustard
Gosh that was good!!!
We had a large fries and a large Cajun fries
Roger is a burger guy and he devoured his burger.

Restaurant was clean!
Staff very friendly and offers great customer service!
Bravo guys for making Roger Happy!!
A new customer you earned :)"}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say! I was a bit apprehensive to try this place based on some yelper reviews in Toronto that said it was greasy & overhyped;Boy I'm glad I tried it. I had the cheeseburger & fries and loaded it with toppings like green peppers,both saut√©ed & raw onions, mushrooms,jalape√±os(no surcharge!) that's my kinda place. 
The burger patty was juicy not greasy & big. Had good simple flavour, the bun soft. The fries fresh hot crispy on outside soft inside. 
I enjoyed every bite & will definitely eat at this location and try another location when I'm back in TDot! Love the free peanuts you help yourself to as well. I have not one complaint about this place so I'm giving it 5/5 cause you got to give credit when it's due. 
C'est fantastique hamburgers et frites et bonne service!"}
{"text":"Always clean and the food is amazing! Every time we come here the staff is friendly and patient as I gather orders for kids and hubby. I miss the Five Guys close to my house but it's worth drive to come and dine with such a nice staff"}
{"text":"Hmm Fast food but not fast food.  I like, but only like.  This reminds me of another place around town and good idea but a few improvements will make it even that much better.  SO this is a fairly new location and they are still working out the kinks the food is good but a few others would have helped a virgin like me ;)  

My first time to any Five guys I expressed that at the counter I would have thought the nice college/late high school student would have helped me at that point.  The menu is plain a no frills menu but sadly I guess my brain was completely shut (like a lot of us) off after a hard days work.  So i did not maneuver the menu well.  I ordered what I thought was awesome but as he called it out I found out I ordered a DOUBLE \"OMG I can't eat that?!  LOL Im sorry\"  He says oh? ok I will redo it for you let me call the manager...\"  Waiting waiting... Me \"ahh ok I will just have the double I'm sure it's great and I need to get on the treadmill anyways.\"  

So I get my food, great stuff nicely done our table shared a bag of fries yes a bag we ordered a small but it is a bag!  Burgers are just as huge, a big bang for the buck I will be back but may ask for help in my newbs ness ;) in the menu department!"}
{"text":"The lineup was long, and the wait for our food was even longer. Everyone kept bumping into me and I kept bumping into other customers. Total chaos! Free peanuts and refills of pop kept us sane. The fountain coke was bubbly - not watered down or flat like most self-serve pop stations. I felt like I was in an American diner.
Food was good. I ordered the mini cheese burger with jalapenos, lettuce, relish, onions, mayo and tomatoes. Next time I'll omit the tomatoes - such huge thick slices. All I could taste was the tomato. Nice fresh produce.
The fries were delicious - cooked so the inside was nice and mealy. It wasn't overcooked or undercooked - good flavour. The small size was too much for both of us. Total for 1 mini cheeseburger, 1 regular burger, regular fries and regular pop was around $20.00.
I would go back, but I think I would try Rocky Burger bar, Boogies, and Moose McGuire before I go back to Five Guys."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food quality. Grilled Onions and mushrooms were not cooked. Burger was dripping oil. I cant believe this is being served to people."}
{"text":"Very pleasant staff. Courteous and quick order. Cooked to perfection. Very generous with the fries. Shakes were good too."}
{"text":"Last evening was my first visit at this location. As a huge fan 5 Guys this location did not impress me. I am highly disappointed in the customer service. I walked in and was not immediately greeted. Matter of fact it was around 7pm at night and the location was super slow. Only two tables had patrons and me the walk in. There were three employees working. A mail stocking up fries, another mail cleaning the grill and a woman who was the person who rang me up stocking/cleaning the condiments. As I stood at the register she did not realize I had been there for a while because she was consumed in her work. Finally another employee noticed me and greeted me. I was asked if I had been here before and mentioned that I had and knew what I wanted. She had no smile and I had to repeat my order three times. Mind you I only ordered one veggie sandwich. She then placed her hand out not even looking at me telling me the total. Once I gave her the money she handed me my receipt and told me my number as she turned her back to walk away. As I my food was being cooked the man making the fries sneezed on his arm. Never washed his hands grabbed another tissue. What is gross he sneezed two more times repeating the same act. With no hand washing going on I prayed he would not be the person to deliver my food. Luckily it was the lady who rang me up but all she did was just handed me my bag then walked away. No thank you for my service. Either she was having a bad day or this is the service at this location which is disappointing as 5 Guys is not known for bad service."}
{"text":"Taste is good, service is good. Prices are awful. Little cheese burger, little fries, and regular (medium sized) soda... $12 and change. Yikes, all that for a burger joint?  That's more than a meal at a decent chain restaurant... 
Not special enough for that price. No thanks"}
{"text":"1st time at this 5-Guys location, never had a complaint about their other Scottsdale location, so thought it was safe to order take-out from this Fashion Square location, WRONG my regular burger was the worst non-meat burger I have had from anywhere in the past year, the meat was no where to be found ! probably less that 1/10th pound !!! if I wasn't already at home eating this it would of been brought to the managers attention, I managed to eat 1/2 of it then why waste my time because all the meat was gone already, maybe this was a fluke & someone only put 1/3 of the meat in ? I will never go back to this location again, as a heads up to anyone take the time when you are handed your order & take a look at the burger & contents to be sure you are receiving what your paying for.  I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because it is very near by in my neighbourhood. I had also heard great things about the Five Guys chain in the past. However it was a huge disappointment. The burgers were not well seasoned and was tasteless. The fries had grit and sand in them and was almost inedible. If I had not done takeout and found this out at home, I would have demanded my money back. The place is run by teenagers who are clearly bored and not into their jobs. All around terrible experience."}
{"text":"Good burgers, great Cajun fries. Love the kaleidoscope variety in their drink dispenser, where you can get any coke product with any variety of flavoring you may crave.  My personal fav, Coke infused strawberry fanta.  Only downside for me, is can't come here with my kids, peanuts are everywhere, not so great for kids with food allergies especially peanuts or nuts."}
{"text":"A friend told us about the awesomeness of Five Guys food. We were in the mood for a good burger so went to this location to try it out. I like the simplicity of the menu; it's just a burger place. It's also extremely greasy... makes a good burger but also makes you want to immediately change your clothes - no going out after you walk into this place. We decided to get our food to go for this reason. We ordered 2 cheese burgers and fries. 
The burger was delicious - greasy and moist... like a good burger should be. The fries - Meh. We were expecting better fries especially with all the signs about how good they were; perhaps the spiced ones were better. They needed something more... or less. More seasonings or just less potato. We dipped them into steak sauce, ketchup and ranch and still just \"meh\". 
So if you are looking for a good burger - def. go here but perhaps skip the fries."}
{"text":"Five guys, you are still letting me down. You are nowhere near as good as you were in VA. I gave you another try tonight and all I can say is WHERE'S THE BEEF? Your patties are so thin and it appears that the only way I will actually be able to taste the burger on the bun is if I order a regular cheeseburger which consist of two patties. I should be able to order a little cheeseburger and still be able to taste the actual burger. I will wait another six months or so to give you one final try here in Arizona before I give up on you all together. Sad, just sad!

PS Your fries are still pretty good and the service was great but your burgers here in Arizona really do leave something to be desired ."}
{"text":"As close as I'm going to get to In 'n' Out Burger on the East Coast.  They have a similar model of doing just a few things well, instead of trying to be all things to all people.  I like that. The burger meat is fantastic--really juicy and not too greasy.  The buns are a bit wimpy, though, and by the time you finish a double patty with cheese, it's flattened to the consistency of a chewy wrap.  The fries are pretty decent, and I tried a milkshake, which was a delight.  All of that set me back about what you'd pay for a sit-down restaurant meal, though.  Even before I got the milkshake, you're hard pressed to get out of there for less than a 10 for a burger and fries, though.  I suppose that also speaks to the quality, since it definitely is a step or two above your average fast food chain.  All in all, it's just fine, but not something I would seek out on any sort of a consistent basis, or treat with the reverence of the aforementioned In 'n' Out."}
{"text":"Got off work late and hungry, figured I'd find out what all the fuss was about.  After all the hype I was kind of expecting high levels of mediocrity, and...I wasn't far off.  The food is good.  Not spectacular, but good.  I'd definitely rate it behind the Stockyards, Holy Chuck and Burgers Priest in terms of flavour and juicyness, to say nothing of the rather small menu options.  Or the price.  On the plus side, you won't leave hungry because the portion sizes are huge.  On the downside, the lineups can be ludicrous, and it is DEAFENINGLY loud in there.  Officially the least best burger joint in town.  Which is still something, I guess."}
{"text":"They make a good JUICY hamburger, thats expensive.

The milkshakes are pretty good."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers. I typically only get the one patty but they have pretty good flavor and the buns are very good. Can't write much else on the burger cause it all depends on what you add to it. As for the beef, most of the time it was done right and flavorful, sometimes not so much. The fries are very good. Not super fantastical or anything but good. But since it's close and pretty good, when I need a burger I'll head down there unless something else comes up. Not bad for a fast food chain!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed five guys and this location has been good during the day time but tonight the food wasn't as good and definitely lacked fries as well"}
{"text":"Food is bland and greasy.  Been to several locations, same issue at all. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Five Guys should be proud of this staff. I've eaten in a few Five Guys an they always seem to have a good quality burger but this location stands out. We have been in a few times and we are always greated with a clean restaurant and a happy staff. I'm not usually a fan of chains but these guys take pride in their work and cook a great burger.  :)"}
{"text":"Been going to five guys for a few years now, always thought it was pretty good but inconsistant. Just moved to this area and have found this to be the best location I have been to. Food is fantastic, staff is friendly, and when they arent busy they are always cleaning. Burgers are flat out awesome here!"}
{"text":"I was driving down Flamingo Rd. on my way to do some errands when I spotted Five Guys out of the corner of my eye. I quickly veered my car into the shopping center's entrance like I was on \"Fast and the Furious.\" I think I may even have drifted. I've been wanting to check this place out for a while and just kinda forgot about it since Smashburger was closer to me in location. 

I ordered fries, soda and a cheeseburger, all for around $10. The burger was yummy and not greasy, albeit small. I got it topped with mushrooms and fresh jalapenos which gave it a nice kick. The order of fries was huge and almost filled the entire paper bag of food. I like that they have the option of dipping them in malt vinegar. They also have those new-fangled Coke fountains with over 100 flavors. Overall experience was good and the service was fast and friendly. The meal price is a concern since the regular burger was teeny with just one patty. Maybe cut down on the fries and up the burger size."}
{"text":"Good Location, lots of parking, the service was nice, there always tables, free peanuts (tho I don't like peanuts)

Have to wait a bit for the food, cause they have to grill/fry it on the spot. for the burgers, it's nothing unique and there isn't many toppings, for a burger chain like this, I'd rather have south st. co. 

However I do like the CAJUN Fries, very fatty and delicious."}
{"text":"The kids like this place due to the beverage machine and the burgers.  It is a easy dicision for dinner when we want burger and dont feel like driving to the strip....

Burger are good size ingredients are fresh.  The fries are enough for 4 people so only order one."}
{"text":"If you have no other reason than a soda machine to go -- than, so be it.

This machine has everything. If you press a button, more options magically appear. Probably no less than 75 options? I don't know.

None the less, Five Guys is Five Guys and you can guess what is hear based on the previous reviews. However, the best seat in the house is by the soda machine and seeing everyone's reactions to it.

Every option imaginable and than some."}
{"text":"Massive portions of french fries - oh MY.

Note to self: order a regular size next time.

Whenever we go, we never finish all of our food and have to throw a lot of it away (boo).

They have free shelled peanuts for the taking as well.

The burgers come with 2 patties as standard.

The burgers & large fries are $5/each.

If you come during rush hour - be prepared to WAIT for your order. I didn't mind though, the quality was amazing. It was loud and crowded but I can see why. 

Keep in mind though, I order things plain so if it comes to flavor - I may not be the best judge. Everyone I have brought it rave about it as well. It was a nice treat."}
{"text":"Well the only good part about this place was the burger biggest complaint is if I'm paying for things I want on my burger I expect what I order to be on my burger. The guy who took my order was rushing us he got all that we ordered down but some how the cooks missed it?? Even when it was clearly on the order. They seemed to busy messing around with each other rather than making the customers order right. Definitely won't be back at this location shame smh."}
{"text":"I tried out this place when I was in Baltimore last winter.  It is good, but not the best burger for the money.  The price is right for what you get for the money.  Once you add fries and a drink you are at $10.00, still not too bad.

I ordered the cheese burger.  I enjoyed have grilled mushrooms and onions on my burger, but the overall taste was bland.  The fries did not really have too much flavor.  

The place is crowded, but they move you along in an orderly manner.  It can be a challenge to find setting during lunch hour.  However, I was able to find a place to sit quickly.

I do not have all that much to say.  The menu is limited and they provide free peanuts."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  This is an awesome burger.  Top five of all time and I am a true burger lover.  You are not getting a healthy option here.  Just the classic burger and fries.  Keep in mind the normal burger is actually a double and the regular fries feeds two easily.  Great value (if you don't over order) and simply fantastic food."}
{"text":"I heard that this place was voted better than IN & OUT BURGER.  The burger was the greasiest concoction I have ever experienced!  Absolutely the worst burger I have ever had. I got it to go and placed it on my front seat, now I have a huge grease stain on my seat.  The grease seeped through the aluminum foil and the bag it was in!  The fries were soggy and tasteless, and how they manage to do that I don't know.
I took one bite of the burger and it completely fell apart and I threw it out, along with the soggy fries.  This food is a heart attack waiting to happen. Biggest waste of $12.00 ever...and that's another thing, waaaay over priced. If you are at all concerned with your health, stay away from here.
IN & OUT has nothing to worry about, still the best in my book."}
{"text":"I've always liked 5 Guys from the first time I went to one in Alexandria Virginia.
But I really like this location as it has a really cosmopolitan clientele.
Now one of my favourite things to order at 5 Guys is a chocolate malt.  You don't see them very much anymore.  But when I was a teenager a few decades ago they were very popular.
The fry's here are hand cut and fried in peanut oil.  They taste better that way imho.  
But the star here is the burgers.  But be careful as they can get pretty big and filling.  The best part is that you can customize them just the way you like them.  Onions on that burger?  If you say yes, they then ask you if you want them raw, fried or caramelized! 
You will find the staff at this location friendly and patient.
Be sure to grab some free peanuts to munch on while you're waiting as they make your food."}
{"text":"I've tried Five Guys twice now, and both have been very disappointing.  I don't get what some people rave about.

First off, the price is insane.  Over $15 for just a regular-size cheeseburger, fries, and drink!  The burgers are very dry other than the weird sticky \"cheez stuff\" they use instead of real cheese.  Even the grilled onions failed to have much flavor.  The fries were nicely crisp on the outside, but have a faint taste of bad oil to them or some other off flavor I can't quite ID.

The free peanuts were quite good."}
{"text":"Simply awful.  We had heard a few people rave about this place, and now I wonder if they were dropped as a baby or how they got this brain damage.  The \"cheese\" is this awful petroleum grease product with yellow color.  That was the worst of it, but nothing was good at all.  And crazy price to boot."}
{"text":"The !food is phenomenal! Would absolutely take others, share w/visiting friends/family. It's rather cold inside, but seeing the history on the walls, makes it worth it! Rather than so much space for 50 lb. bag crates, it would be great to have a television or local newspapers to enjoy with everyone. Munching on free peanuts while waiting for your order remind you of being in a backyard bbq!    Largest seating area I've ever seen for a shopping center restaurant!  Even if a kids sports team enters or groups of loud people, you can move to enjoy your meal in quiet.  This meal is something to savor!  Very fresh and favorful... BUT very oily french fries, but again, they are REAL!  
The tables/chairs and restrooms need to be cleaned, though not unhygienic.  The hamburgers are cooked infront of you.  Have a homemade taste/resembling In/Out, but on a Larger, HUGE scale!  One order of fries could easily have fed a family of 4!  The small burger is large size at Red Robin!  With so much food, they need to keep the air free of any oily and stickiness from the meal.  
Maybe having Wipes on a Roll at each table, would be a great addition.  The outdoor seating needs to be addressed, but that might be a shopping center issue.  This restaurant could 100% be a outdoor restaurant (like Monestary) and will live forever!  If they are able to relocate, would definitely make for a phenomenal place to have a party or catered, by having them cook food....Scrapbook worthy!"}
{"text":"Very very expensive!! $24.00 for 2 people ! Regular cheese burger,small hamburger,2 small fries and 2 drinks ,burgers were nothing spectacular. sorrta greasy.fries were in two cups and the rest thrown in the bottom of the bag! Don't get that? The brown bag was full of grease at the bottom of the bag!! You would not want to have put it on the seat in your car!! Cheese was American for the price should have had real cheese! I don't get the hype over this burger joint! Go to Culver's and get a better burger at 1/2 the price!!"}
{"text":"First time here food is ok not what i expected when ppl talked about this place.  The cashier super nice tho gave me extra fries. Place looks very clean. Staff is nice too i mean nothing is wrong just was expecting more flavor to my food and nope nothing but over all we all have different taste buds we all don't like the same things so in my opinion it was okay."}
{"text":"Wow good sloppy greasy burgers really hit the spot. The patty was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I took the beacon cheese one patty with choice of free toppings : mayo BBQ sauce lettuce raw onions grilled onions mushrooms pickles. It fell apart but I didn't care. My bf got the same with different toppings and we shared some Cajun fries, delicious by the way. There were 3 ppl in front of us on a Saturday afternoon not bad. I don't like high chairs and high tables they hurt my thighs but that's the only thing I didn't like. Worth a trip if your in the mood for something comforting. We paid 21$"}
{"text":"Burgers are always good, but the fries always suck.
Never once have I had a crispy fry at this place, always soggy and taste like old oil or something.  
Basically if you like fries don't buy them here, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ok heard the summerlin store head milkshakes,,not true. Slurp out of machine, the place was short staffed, dirty tables and floors. ran out of catsup had to use packets!! pass on this place. Go to Five Guys on West flamingo.they have it all(no shakes but ok) clean and excellent staff"}
{"text":"Famine, earthquakes, typhoons. All three occurred at this establishment when I didn't get my food in under 30 minutes. The staff was nice but I got fake people showing fake love to me straight up to my face. \"Six cold like Alaska\" but Five Guys sent shivers down my spine with their ineptitude. I felt betrayed like Benedict Arnold or even Judas. What happened to me I wouldn't wish to happen on Satan himself. In my nightmares I see a world of clowns kidnapping puppies and forcing them to eat food from the Five Guys on Providence Road. 

Overall I was very upset with the service of this place. They take so incredibly long to crank out an order. I remember coming here with my friends and their service was impeccable. Oh How the mighty have fallen. Also super disappointed in the drink machine not being very good either. Just an overall poor place to eat your food. Unless you want to wait 3 hours to get your food. 1/10 would not recommend to a friend. Find another Five Guys but this one is about as valuable as the last poop I took in the toilet."}
{"text":"5 Guys opened up about 2 years ago and I have always received very consistent taste and service from this location

It is situated right next to Rumbi's Island Grill and I always struggle with healthy food or greasy food for lunch. It's a 50/50 coin toss on which one I end up walking into. (I do however prefer the 5 Guys burger to the Rumbi's burger) What I would pass on is the California Pizza Kitchen next door, man has this chain gone down hill, talk about a rip off.

5 Guys burgers & fries are cooked fresh to order, another words you have to wait for them. They cook in the open ... right in front of you ... not sure what some of these other reviews are on about.

They use fresh potatoes for their fries and fry them in peanut oil at at higher temperature than normal vegetable oil, they come out very crunchy and golden brown. They kick butt all over In & Out french fries IMO, and 1 order is enough for 2 people. 

Their burgers are twice as thick as In & Out, twice as tasty IMO, and a good value when you consider the amount of toppings and meat you receive. I also like munching those \"free\" peanuts and tossing the shells on the floor while I wait for my order.

I guess I am a fan of 5 Guys burgers,  also a fan of Smash Burgers, and Delux too.

                          All different, all good ... depends on my mood!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger place. You choose what burger you want and then proceed to the toppings (All toppings are free, so choose all you want).

Burger started to fall apart at the end, guess it was the excessive amount of ketchup and mustard they put on.

The Cajun fries was recommended by the cashier and I thank her for that. Those fries were amazing!"}
{"text":"First time I ever had five guys was ft Myers Florida. First feed of it in Vegas and not disappointed. Always a good cure for hangover. As was the case today. Great burgers and Fries and  love the extra in the bag top off of more fries."}
{"text":"This location was absolutely amazing. Everyone was friendly and the food was perfect. I had the Little Bacon Cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushrooms and the Cajun fries. I can't express how tasty everyone was. The tables were all clean as was the drink station and condiment station. The owner even walked around cleaning tables and asked us how everything was, offered us more fries and was even behind the counter helping the staff cook/ prepare food. 

Definitely recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"At first this location completely turned me off from Five Guys, but after trying the Downtown Summerlin location and then trying this place out again, I'm hooked (which is really a bad thing). All the workers here are friendly and goofing around in the kitchen - and I don't mean messing things up, I mean they genuinely seem to enjoy themselves and try to have fun with what they're doing. I spent a week thinking about their tasty burgers and finally fulfilled my craving last night. Thanks for serving up delicious food!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Five Guys. When I lived in the  Bay Area, when one opened up in my local mall, I wasn't that excited since people in the area were mostly In N Out loyalists. I ate at the Flamingo/Fort Apache location one time when I was rushing to get to the airport and was a bit grossed out by the soggy, oil-filled bag I had to carry food in. I've been avoiding Five Guys ever since, but due to a long wait at the newly opened Sports Clips next door, I decided to come over to their new Downtown Summerlin location since I was starving and my husband couldn't leave the waiting room. This place actually did impress me. Everything was clean and the workers were beyond professional. One of the customers ahead of me just didn't understand the very straight-forward menu and was clarifying every-little-thing, but the cashier behind the counter answered all questions with a smile (whereas I was starving and wanted to choke them). Aside from said customer, ordering was fast and easy (I should have listened to the cashier when she said the \"Little\" order of fries was all I needed). The kitchen is open so you can see everyone working in sync with each other. If they saw someone lingering around the pick-up area, there was a worker there asking if there was anything could get them while they waited. Condiments area was clean and filled and of course, they have everyone's favorite futuristic soda dispensers with a ton of choices (including my favorite, Ginger Ale!). The bag my burger came in was still grease-stricken, but I didn't mind it so much here and I happily scarfed down my bacon cheeseburger next door."}
{"text":"Hamburger(2 PAT/$6.49)

I had an Angus Third Pounder @McD earlier and the Patty taste, smell, and felt quite similar.  Obviously there are slight differences overall but with this note, I'm not sure if Five Guys is overly status-quo or McD making competitive improvements.

Why does the Burger Bun always get dented?  
Is that a characteristic of a good Burger?
Can't complain about FREE Nuts, just can't.

Painted Metallic chairs to look like Wooden chairs."}
{"text":"This place is a bit on the pricey side, but the food is delicious. You have to buy everything separate, with each burger costing $8.00 or less. Then factor the drinks in. We ended up ordering a large fry, and split the large between 4 people. It was enough so that works out. For four people it ended up being about $45.00. The Cajun fries are the way to go when ordering. 

This is not a place to eat everyday if you're wallet conscious like myself, but every once in a while it could be a nice treat!"}
{"text":"Worst five guys I've even been to. My burger was over cooked and the workers were just fooling around. No one cared to help me out. I'm a frequent visitor at five guys and I've never experience such horrible customer service or horrible food."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and fries! Yesterday, on a Sunday was a great day to go. Wasn't too crowded and the staff was very accommodating and friendly! So nice that they have FREE peanuts in the shell, all you want and you just help yourself!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I've only eaten at one Five Guys establishment and this is the one. The customer service at this location is outstanding and good is great. The location is in close proximity to where I live so that is a bonus for me. The burgers, while sometimes a little greasy are delicious and the Cajun fries are perfect. Back to the customer service, these employees are very professional and their management should be proud of their crew."}
{"text":"After posting about a visit to the Tempe location on facebook, a buddy expressed a desire to check out Five Guys.  I met him at the Val Vista location today for lunch with my 4 month old and he brought his 6 year old.  

As always, the place was very clean, and although it was lunchtime on a weekend, we were through the line quickly (must have been before the Mormons got out of services).  We both ordered cheeseburgers and his son got a grilled cheese, along with a large order of regular fries.

My buddy loves CheesburgerCheeseburger, so I was anxious to hear how FG compares.  He took his first bite and had a very suprisingly pleased look on his face.  The double patty cheeseburger, complete with plenty of accoutrement, was jucy and flavorful. After a previously distatetful experience with the cajun fries, the regular fries are absolutly superior.  

The staff at this location gets extra points for checkin in on us (they knew we had a first timer on our hands) and going the extra mile.  I wanted my friend to check out the cajun fries, but they didn't have any cooked up, so they just gave us some spice to put on the extra fries that we had.  Then, they called the 6 year old over to the counter and gave him a WHOLE NEW FRESH bag of cajun fries.  \"We didn't have any samples for you, so we decided to just cook you up a whole batch.\"  Seriously awesome service!  

Sure, the lunch for 2.5 of us cost $25, and I'd only really go for something special, but I have a feeling every visit will be quite excellent!"}
{"text":"The staff was extremely friendly! Great food and free peanuts! Many options for what you wanna drink! 100% satisfied."}
{"text":"Oh happy happy joy joy!  I recently experienced this luscious burger chain while visiting NYC a couple of weeks back and have been craving their burgers ever since. So happy to have one so close to my side of town I could just pee with excitement!!  Headed there right now. All is now right with the world."}
{"text":"First off, I'll admit it is partly our own fault. My wife ordered a bacon cheeseburger and I ordered just a cheeseburger. We got a large fries for both of us to share and two drinks. $25. I love the soft drink machine that offers many different flavors available to add to your favorite drink. My wife took a bite of her burger and said they didn't include the bacon. I'd already tried mine and knew I had just a cheeseburger, so not hers. I told her I'm sure the bacon is in there, it's just hidden in the middle with the cheese. She continued to eat without bringing it up again. It wasn't until we were home and talking about our lunch that she told me again there wasn't any bacon.  Our fault for not bringing it to their attention while we were there, but clumsy for them to forget, especially since we paid extra for the bacon. I've never had a problem with Fudruckers. If I'm going to pay that much for burger and fries, I'll go to In n Out or Fudruckers next time. Even McDonalds hasn't messed up like that before. Good burger and fries, I'm sure an honest mistake, but it will be a while before we return."}
{"text":"I'm used to five guys in the UK, I know the brand ands what to expect, this place for what they charge is poor, hardly any sauce or topping put on an overlooked burger.

i'll miss this place out the next craving i have for burgers"}
{"text":"This is our burger joint!  I love this place.  The hamburgers are the closest to a home made burger.  This place is not some fancy hamburger kobe beef kind of place.  This is a good old fashion hamburger.  This isn't your secret menu, I have to eat there or I am going to die kind of hamburger place.  This is also not your Oh my, I just spent $12 on a hamburger because I wanted some toppings on it place.  Five guys doesn't think they need to charge for all the fixin' so they through it in for free.  Also the fries, oh the fries!  We order the regular and they throw in a big pile of fries in the bag.  Since this restaurant moved into town.  I can't really enjoy a burger anywhere else. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review for a while now.  This place just opened up a few months ago.  My work is close by and some of my coworkers who are from the east coast were buzzing about the grand opening.  I had never heard of it being from the west coast.  I decided to check it out because I am a big hamburger fan.  I went the second day it was open after work to get dinner and it was insane! the restaurant was crazy packed.  I ordered a cheeseburger and the topping were free, so I got grilled mushrooms and vegtables with the burger.  I think this burger was amazing! I ended up here twice in one week when it opened.  Since then I have gone several times.  It's not like In-N-Out or Fatburger.  They even have fresh french fries with real potatoes.  The fries don't taste funny like the In-N-Out fries.  They give you a lot of fries when you order the regular, so you can share with someone.  I think the walls are funny because they have all the awards in the east coast.  I don't care if they won anything over there, how 'bout they win some stuff over here.  If you haven't tried this burger joint yet, you really need to! it's really good!! Cheers!"}
{"text":"When I was eating like a rabbit on the HCG diet, and getting my vegetables at Traders Joes; I  always passed by  Five Guys, and was dreaming what their burgers taste like.    The task of  500 calorie a day diet was killing me, but a few days after the diet was up, I ran through their doors, and looking at the menu.

Perhaps, I was asking for more from Five Guys, but it was a okay experience.    I ordered the double cheese burger with grilled onions, and mushrooms, fries, and soda.   

While i was waiting for my order, which wasn't too long of a wait (about 5 minutes)  I looked around the seating area, and the crew kept the tables clean, and tidy.   What I didn't notice when I walked in, the buckets of peanuts for any customer to chow down on before your food comes.   I guess, my mind was focused on eating meat and potatoes.    Also, I was very happy with the selection of sodas...any place with Coke Zero is alright with me.

When I got my burger. it  was totally greasy, and a little more salty than I usually like, but what the heck, it's a burger, and I feeling like T-Rex with a smaller stomach.      The fries are better than IN n OUT, but for the amount cash spent, it better have.       My total came out  close to 14.00 for Double Cheeseburger, Fries, and soda.    

It was good burger, but for the price...not a great deal"}
{"text":"Great location with fast and friendly service of reliably delicious burgers made to your liking. Parking can be tricky if they're busy."}
{"text":"I went yesterday after noon to the mall and then here. My first time eating at five guys burgers and fries. I this is what I got and recommend

cheeseburger with
lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions, ketchup, mustard
with regular fries cajun style

The cheeseburger is in between and in&out burger and a culver's burger. And they fries are very good, even though they look dry. Put some ketchup on them fries because they have a very strong flavor. And finally the soda machine lol I seen that on tv and funny that after me there was 2 teenagers and they guy was what the?....vanilla coke? and i can pick more flavors? He was so surprise that he started talking to the female about it and saying can you believe that?lol wow. And is it me or my lol look like a drowning guy LOL"}
{"text":"Fatburger and In-N-Out move over!

It was the weekend of CityScapes grand opening, and one of the busiest places was this burger joint. I came here with a friend between concerts, and was amazed by how great the burgers were! Here's the rundown:

The place: nice and clean (however, it was opened for only a few days when I went). They have boxes of peanuts sitting out for you to scoop a bunch and eat while in line, or sitting and enjoying your burger. I'm not a peanut fan, but I thought it was pretty cool! However, they make a mess, even with the crew cleaning the shells up constantly.

The service: friendly and fast. Now, when I went, about half of Phoenix was in the area because of CityScape, so it did take a while to get our burgers, but that was expected with a line out the door (that formed in a matter of minutes). I'm sure on a normal day, the service would be much quicker.

The price: it's...pricey. Yes, you get a good burger, and a \"Small\" is the size of a normal burger anywhere else, but almost $6? I felt like it was just a tad but too much. However, you can get almost anything you want on the burger for no additional charge. I didn't get fries or a drink (because of the price, and I already had a Pepsi in hand). 

Overall, I'm impressed. So far, Five Guys wins my vote as the best burger in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Decent messy burgers with a great choice of toppings.  Cajun fries are yummy but a little in the salty side. Dip em in mayo and you're good to go."}
{"text":"I am glad 5 Guys is nowhere near San Francisco cause there's a HIGH probability, I will eat here daily. Knowing this was our dinner before a grueling heat ridden backpacking excursion, we proceeded to load up on carbs and protein. 

My favorite is the mini bacon cheeseburger (perfect size, price, and calorie intake). Flavorful meat, crispy bacon AND copious complimentary toppings makes 5 Guys stand out. The soda machine captured our interests and even those of us who don't drink soda was intrigued. If you crave potato, the cajun fries are the way to go!"}
{"text":"Has lunch here today.

Service was great ; the cashier was super friendly.
Waiting time for burgers were a little long.
Some items that I didn't ask for were in the hamburger. 
Fries were dark brown.

I won't go out of my way to come back as it was a 'meh' experience."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood burger joint. I feel like even as a franchise, they haven't skipped any corners.

My only qualm is that I'm highly allergic to tomatoes. Even though I do not order tomatoes on my burger, it never fails that they put one on there, and I have to tell them to remake. Not sure if they are on auto pilot sometimes, but definitely something I always check for.

The soda machine used to be an attraction but I've started seeing these machines in other restaurants now.

The cajun fries are tasty but I wish they were just a little more crispy and not as soggy.

Fun place for a quick lunch or dinner, but the prices seem a little high for a *regular* spot."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers. I wish they were bigger. The price needs to be lowered. Paid almost $15 for a cheeseburger fries and small drink. Maybe it's just the downtown area. Their fries is what impressed me the most. They were so good. I will definitely come back but maybe their other locations since this one is pretty small."}
{"text":"So yesterday we stopped here to try this place out since Ive heard so much about it lately. I honestly liked it! 

Juicy, tasty burgers. Fun atmosphere. The boxes of salted peanuts in a shell is a new and nice touch. You can scoop some peanuts onto a little tray and have a snack while waiting for your food to be done.

The burgers were a little pricey, but the service was quick and friendly.

We will be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Five Guys in a good long time. I do have to say that its really one of the best burgers out there. This location is on par with the chains in the rest of the country, clean, spacious and a great staff.
I love the customizations you can do with your burgers, peanuts while you wait? YES, PLEASE. 
And a lot of milkshake concoctions, my girly figure will be a lot more curvactious!

Verona the order taker was so sweet and courteous, I would definitely curtail my current burrito and falafel obsessions and head over to Five Guys for lunch a lot more often."}
{"text":"Great burgers , French fries and walking distance. To my house ! 
A  great addition . Some of the staff I recognize from other stores .
Good food and Service ."}
{"text":"Ever since my first visit to Five Guys (in Texas), I've always enjoyed their fresh cooked burgers, and the amazing fries. Tonight was my first disappointment - the burger was great, but they were really chintzy with the fries.  The large order was barely enough for one person, when usually it's more than enough for two.  I'm hoping this was just a fluke so I don't have to take them off my list of favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"The food is okay, with thick burgers and lots of french fries, but the menu was limilted.
Still the affordability was a good thing and the food quality was decent. 

Two of the things at this location that brought my expereince down two notches were service oriented.

The fact that the person cleaning up chose to sweep around my table while I as sitting there was a bit off putting.  It wasn't a rush time, we'd deliberately chosen to get there early to avoid the rush. 

The hollering kitchen supervisor with her strident, bullying tone completely annoyed me.  Kitchen work is not easy but having a bossy-bessy in the open area kitchen with a sharp edged tone was evident as I watched her demand tasks be done in a military style.

I might try it again with someone who really likes the place, but to go back alone or recommend it to freinds?   Meh,  there are better burger joints to eat at."}
{"text":"These are the happiest, friendliest employees on earth. I had never been to Five Guys- I was a confirmed in and out guy. No more. This is the best burger, killer spicy fries, and best team I have ever experienced. How day do dat?
The best."}
{"text":"I love this location!!! Working for l INO for 2+ years, it's understandable that I can be picky about my burgers. However everytime I come here these guys (and girls!!) Out do themselves. So much so I have become a regular once a week here. Not only the associates but even the manager is always friendly and making sure everything was made correctly!! Even throwing me a few fries in the bag  ((at no cost)) keep up the great work!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm with Jason C. on this one.  Given the price for the cheeseburger I bought, I was a little \"Meh,\" about it.  It did taste pretty good; it was pretty bomb but it I've had cheaper and better.

The fries, yeah, are pretty damn good too.  

The decor is alright.  The line to get your food and the actual dining area is divided by sacks of potatoes.  Yes, it's tacky but I thought that was cool.

Oh, and free peanuts.

If you ride a bike, DO NOT use the bike rack right out in front.  Don't do it.  You see all that bird shit everywhere?  If you, for one minute, assume that you're not gonna get shit on, you are incorrect.  I was lazy so I chanced it.  Unlocking my bike to go home, BULL'S EYE.  I got poop right on my eyebrow.  Gross.

This is a decent place.  It's worth trying out if you're in the area of if you're curious.  Three stars, I like it but I'm not crazy about it."}
{"text":"For the money you can not get a better greasy burger, the bacon is deep fried, fries are fresh and tasty, mmm delicious. Been dozens of times never disappointed, also good homemade shakes."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys even more so (so far) than Burger Priest, this location is superior to the Major Mac location in Woodbridge but the Major Mac location is almost connected to my subdivision so I go there more now

The taste and quality is much more consistent here. 

My regular order is a cheeseburger with ketchup, mustard, mayo and jalape√±o....to be quite honest I dont know if I would like this place as much without the jalape√±o

My cousin never liked this place until he got the same toppings as me and I have learned from other burger joints that your choice of toppings will directly dictate your affinity for the burger so choose wisely!

Cajun fries are also awesome, I suggest ordering the small since they load your bag up anyways"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a Five Guys. I had heard good things and had no idea that there was a location opening in Ahwatukee until I drove by today and opted to grab some lunch to go. Apparently it opened November 4.

Learn from my mistake - the regular burger is huge. Two patties and heavy \"fixins.\" Unless you are really hungry, the little burger should be plenty for an adult. As far as fast food burgers go, it is one of the best I have had. Definitely better than In and Out. The lettuce, tomato, etc. were fresh, the cheese was quality, and they even offer grilled mushrooms which were super tasty.

The fries, on the other hand, were super greasy and soggy. In the future I will stick to just the burgers.

It was lunchtime and I expected a warzone, but the service was quick and the employees were extremely friendly and helpful.

Definitely worth putting on your fast food burger list."}
{"text":"Had them in the states, and it was a far better experience.  many things are different up here, and not for the better.  Had the bacon cheeseburger, Cajun fries and coke.  Way over priced, especially for a chain.  Had all these little cards of where they buy the food from locally, nice thought, but all I could think is, \"So you're using this to justify the outrageous prices?\".  The US franchises buy locally but are more reasonably/competitively priced.

Got the food and it looked like I may have an experience worth the price.  WRONG!  Big burger, but looks like process cheese on it.  Bacon cooked perfectly, little chewy and a little crunchy!  the beef had no flavour, how is that possible?  This isn't some Slim Jim burger, yet couldn't taste the burger itself.
For the fries, all I could taste was the seasoning.  very disappointing.  Very common mistake by burger joints, when I order fries I want to taste potato WITH seasoning, not just the seasoning.
I did love the free peanuts to curb your hunger while waiting, that is a great idea!  If you have a peanut allergy, or part of the PC phobia bunch, then stay away.

Overall, there are other chains (Harvey's, Wendy's) that are better, at least in Canada."}
{"text":"Blah.

I've definitely experienced better.

My boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger \"all the way,\" meaning that it has all the toppings. I ordered a hamburger with mushrooms and grilled onions (boring, I know). We also got seasoned fries to share and two fountain drinks. We spent almost $30 on two burgers, seasoned fries, and two drinks. Honestly, I wouldn't mind spending that much or even more if this was some fancy burger joint, but it wasn't. There were piles of peanuts everywhere, fries in cups, and burgers wrapped in foil. All they need now is a ringmaster and an elephant to justify the pricing. 

Our food came out within 7 minutes or so. We ripped open the fries bag for easy access and the first thing I noticed when picking out my first fry was that they were all pretty soggy. Don't get me wrong, I used to love soggy fries as a child,  but nowadays my boyfriend and I both like our fries nice and crisp, which is not what we had here. The burgers were in the same state as the fries. I understand that they're known for wrapping their burgers in foil, but c'mon, that just makes them all sweaty and soggy. Since my boyfriend got everything on his burger, the bottom was soaked in sauce and not in the delicious Carl's Jr. lookin' way. He said it was okay, but didn't end up finishing it. Mine on the other hand wasn't drenched in sauce, BUT it did look like someone wrapped it in foil and b*tch slapped it. It was all round except for one side that was flat. How does that even happen between the time they finish making it and giving it to us? The mushrooms were all droopy an didn't exactly look fresh. I finished my burger, but I was not satisfied. It was just boring. I could've gotten a better tasting burger for much cheaper at many other places in town."}
{"text":"5 stars for a fast food place?  Yep. Get the bacon burger. I always do the little burger since I don't need two patties. The bacon here is so super crisp. I can't believe I just analyzed fast food bacon. It's clearly not the  thick cut applewood smoked concoction you'd get at a restaurant, but it works so well with the burger. 

Yes, the bag gets greasy. That's because get don't just fill your fry cup, they then dump another scoop over everything. 

The fries are on the thicker side with skin. I prefer fries with skin. They're crisp and also soft. I crave these fries. Perfectly salted. 

I don't ever do In-N-Out because I think the fries are awful. So, I can't compare burgers since it's been so long. All I know is that I won't touch In-N-Out fries with a ten foot poll, and I never ever eat fast food burgers, but I absolutely LOVE Five Guys. This is a wonderful addition to Downtown Summerlin!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I come here when we are craving a traditional American burger but want to take it home (otherwise we go to Bachi burger).  I love adding jalape√±os, bacon and onions to my burger. The fries are really good. Slightly thicker cut then I usually prefer, but so tasty. I crave these fries!  I think it must be because they're fried in peanut oil. I think it's cool that they can be so successful even though they use peanut oil and have peanuts everywhere, since peanut allergies seem common. But I'm glad they use peanut oil because it makes the fries so crisp!"}
{"text":"After initially not being a fan of Five Guys, i now get the craving. i started out not liking it because i used to be in the \"Why pay more than a dollar like i can at McDonalds?\" mindset. But i do enjoy the burgers and the nice selection of toppings you can add. 

i go with the Little Cheeseburger (lettuce, kechup, mustard, jalopenos, mushrooms, mayo) and it is big enough for me, especially since the amount of fries they serve is insane. Every time i go, i think they must have thought i placed an order for the Super Ginormous size fries, but i always get charged for just the regular size. i go with cajun style fries and am always satisfied and deal with the cajuny reflux it provides hours later without complaint.

This is not the best store space for Five Guys as it is kind of cramped having the drink self-service station in the narrow hall to the bathroom. What can you do? It fits nicely in the Epicenter though.

Fyi...They do have very limited (maybe 3 tables) outdoor seating just outside their front door."}
{"text":"I am glad I have an open mind. If I didn't, I would've missed out on the better-than-average burger I had today at Five Guys. I know that sounds like a shallow compliment. But, when you consider my other Five Guys review (Flagstaff location), this is considerably better.

I've eaten at Five Guys maybe three times. Today, me and five other guys (seriously) from work decided to try the Five Guys at 44th Street and Thomas. It was probably the fact that I was craving a burger that I decided to give this chain another shot to impress me. I still don't get all the hype.

I chose the Bacon Cheeseburger and added grilled mushrooms, onion, mustard and lettuce. As I said, it was better than an average burger. I will give them props for three things. The service is very quick and friendly. The selection of toppings is very impressive. And I don't recall the \"Little\" portion of fries being an option, but it was perfect for my lunch.

However, I can name several other places where I've enjoyed a burger that I won't soon forget. One of those places (Two Hippies Gnarly Burger Joint) use to be right down the street, but it unfortunately closed. While Five Guys has a great product, there are two things it hasn't overcome in my mind.

When you leave the toppings selection to the customer, they will either get exactly what they want, and love it. Or, they will regret their combination of items and walk away disappointed. The second hurdle is the price. Even those who have never set foot in a Five Guys know these places are expensive. My double bacon cheeseburger, small fries and large drink set me back $16.04 including tax. The burger alone was almost $9!

Unfortunately, it didn't taste like $9."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday to give Five Guys another chance and had a cheeseburger (one patty), fries and a soft drink for $9.42. I couldn't even taste the burger since the enourmous bun swallowed the burger. Obviously, this bun is meant for the double patty burgers. The regular fries are ok but the cajun fries are brutal because they are drenched with spices which renders the fries inedible. I can think of few burger joints off the top of my head that have a much lower price point and burgers that are much more tastier than Five Guys (Culver's, Lenny's & In-n-Out to name a few)."}
{"text":"I went into Five Guys after hearing all of the hype surrounding it. I was very intrigued, and I love how Chick Fil A uses peanut oil to fry everything, so I figured it would be something like a beefy version of Chick Fil A. I ordered a little bacon cheeseburger with bbq sauce, grilled onions, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato alongside some Cajun
fries. 

The burger was delicious. It was really juicy, and I loved how the crust of the meat was very crispy. The cheese was delicious as well. The jalapenos added a nice kick to the burger.

The cajun fries were really bad though. They needed some salt, and they needed it badly. Otherwise, they were well seasoned, but I couldn't eat more than a couple of fries without feeling this immense dryness in my mouth. Another pet peeve is that they only have malt vinegar and ketchup for the fries. I tried the malt vinegar with the fries, and I thought it was disgusting. It didn't taste like malt vinegar to me. It tasted more like apple cider vinegar. Since I'm not a ketchup fan, I didn't end up eating a lot of the fries. You could really taste that they were fried in peanut oil by the way. It wasn't a positive or a negative; it was just very prevalent.

Overall, I won't be coming back to 5 guys. I'm going to stick to In N Out and Smashburger."}
{"text":"Burger was dry.  Fries were way overcooked, burnt taste.   I went there  for a good burger and fries.  Five Guys used to be good.  Never at $11.00.  Won't be back any time soon!  Was there on a early Saturday afternoon, restaurant not busy at all."}
{"text":"$72 for 4 people?! Cajun fries were all right; but, the burger in my opinion was just ok. We're talking about burgers and fries here...no shakes, no desserts, literally burgers, fries and medium drinks- $72. Seriously should have stuck with in-n-out. Would have been less than HALF the price and a way better burger. I could  have also purchased an X-large unsweetened tea with fresh lemons at in-n-out too!"}
{"text":"Located on the bustling Yonge Street area, this burger joint is not hard to spot. My first impression of the place was that it was kind of boring in terms of d√©cor. The restaurant's interior isn't all that unique although their signature red and white checkered patterned walls did add a little bit of character to the place. The layout is organized and there is also plenty of seating available to accommodate parties of all sizes. The atmosphere is very casual and it's a good place to hang out with your friends or family.

The service was not impeccable and very much comparable to your typical fast food joint: place your order here and pick up your order there, sometimes you get a smile and sometimes you don't. They were friendly enough but really nothing to rave about.

What I ordered: little cheese burger & fries
There isn't anything little about these burgers. In fact, they seem average sized for me. The patties aren't grandiose in size and would fall within the standard burger patty sizes served in restaurants across Toronto. Taste wise, they are mediocre. I didn't find anything too impressive about them and it certainly was not something that should be worth a couple of bucks more than any other burger I've had in my life. The best part of the meal was the french fries. Crispy and fresh, these guys know how to do their fries. The portion of the fries was huge and overflowing with greasy, calorie infused goodness. Warning to those that have any food allergies: they cook the fries in peanut oil.

Overall, I found the place to be a little pricey, especially since you can get the same thing for a cheaper price at another fast food burger joint downtown. I don't really think you are getting your moneys worth in terms of value and quality of the product. I am also disappointed that they do not serve important fast food staples such as onion rings but I guess they are trying to stick to basics at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Five Guys knows how to make a fresh burger.  Everything tastes great and fresh.  They are very generous on their fries too!  Their soda machine also kicks the butt of any soda machine you've seen.  Definitely check them out if you want a juicy, tasty and fresh burger!"}
{"text":"Better burger & fries than In-N-Out, but a little pricey for a burger joint with loud music and no adult beverages or dessert.

I say better than In-N-Out because it's a similar concept of freshly cut fries and grill top burgers with fresh toppings.  Where they excel is the burger patties are bigger and the fries have more flavor."}
{"text":"\"It was so good my taste buds died!\"  -my son.
After getting a killer haircut my son and I went in to Five Guys Burgers to have a man meal. Place is clean, well lit, decorated sparsely and no frills which is good. Led Zeppelin was playing in the background - which is a win automatically. The clerk took time to teach us about the menu and let us know that even though my little guy has big eyes he would probably do better with the little burger vs the regular burger. The regular burger comes with two patties the little burger comes with one patty. Good call on her part. We split a medium order of fries and got two drinks. The drinks of a new crazy interactive coke machines that everyone seems to be going to.

It took about 5 minutes to get your burger which is actually really good considering everything is made fresh as you order it. Produce looked great, you can munch on peanuts while you wait, dining room is clean and well lit. I have absolutely nothing to complain about here. This place is about a mile down the street from another burger restaurant that I reviewed a little while back and I can easily see the other burger restaurant not lasting much longer with Five Guys Burgers in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great authentic feel but not a fan (yet). It was my first time ever at Five Guys and some things really impressed me like the complimentary peanuts, insane soda machine and the sheer dazzling amount of choices to customize your hamburger. I had the regular with a side of fries. I wasn't really blown away by the fries, mainly because they were a pitch too salty. The fries are sliced large and fried with that crispy brown finish that resonates home-made style fries. I personally prefer thin fries with the yellow finish with a slight crisp, like the ones at In-and-Out or Smashburger. The hamburger is satisfying and savoring with every bite. However towards the end it can get very messy and almost laborious to finish it. I thought it lacked a certain \"wow\" factor and the fries are mediocre. My friend said that the burger is way better with customizations such as the A1 sauce and etc but I was expecting the regular one to pull through and blow the competition away. Definitely gonna try the customizations next time but it won't be for a while."}
{"text":"Double thick yummy beef patties are the norm - Score!
A zillion add-on ingredients- Score again!
Friendly, super fast service - Yes, and yes!

I am SO EXCITED that this little spot is right down the street in the new Summerlin Downtown shopping area. Have already hit it a couple times on the way home. I get BIG brownie points with the Husbear showing up with a delicious dinner in hand, and 5-Guys makes that SUPER EASY! 

...And if you do not know what a \"Husbear\" is, Google it! It is a great slang to know. :-)"}
{"text":"Yeah. Super pricey. Over $14 bucks for a greasy poorly made sloppy burger, with two stale 4\" burger patties. A large drink (the highlight of the visit was they had MELLO YELLO) and some extra salty fries.  Will not go back. Chuckbox has ALWAYS been the place."}
{"text":"Located right in the middle of Pitt campus, Five Guys is a super convenient, quick, and relatively affordable place to grab a bite (I say relatively only because for a college campus, it's pretty in the middle, price wise). I didn't go much when I was actually in undergrad, since my roommate was very allergic to peanuts and I didn't want to risk bringing some peanut dust home with me. 

Just stopped by last week after finishing some assignments on campus, and got a burger and small boat of peanuts. The burger was tasty - they have a long list of toppings that can be added on to customize. The bun held up well, although I did have a bit of grease drip from the bottom bun halfway through, so it ended up a little messy. Overall a good place to stop for a quick meal. Small, but comprehensive menu of burgers, fries, grilled cheese, and shakes (I think hot dogs as well?) so it's easy to decide quickly."}
{"text":"Good, hot and fresh. i spent about what i spend at BK and McD if i don't use their nasty $1 menu. they will get my biz from now on."}
{"text":"My friends and I arrived at 5 Guys at 9:42pm on a Thursday evening.  They are open until 10pm.  I was the first one through the door and approached the counter where the young man offered to take my order.  Other members of my party began to trickle in behind me and I apologized for coming in with a group of 7 so near closing. It was at this time that a young man wiping tables piped up and stated that they could not serve us because it was too close to 10:00.  It was now 9:44.  

One of my friends asked him if it was the policy of the store to stop serving before 10:00 and he insisted that they couldn't take our order, \"My GM said to stop serving\". My friend asked again if they could serve us as it seemed unlikely this was store policy. 
This young man (who's name I am withholding) said, without making eye contact with any of us, \"Fine then!  If you want to order, go ahead and order\" and returned to wiping tables.  Hmmmmm... Should we have our food prepared by someone who is being somewhat hostile towards us and doesn't want to serve us?  No thanks.  

I, like most of the members of our party have worked in food service and or retail at some point and we know how it works.  You take orders or seat guests until close.  Does it suck when someone comes in near close?  YES, but that is just the way it works).  It wasn't imperative that we have 5 Guys, but it was the only nearby place one member of our party (gluten free) could eat.  

We chose to not eat at 5 Guys in light of the unwelcoming attitude we received.  We went to Steak N Shake where our gluten free friend enjoyed a glass of water.  You guys blow. Seriously."}
{"text":"Um, these burgers are really good. Like surprisingly good. I am kind of drooling right now just thinking about them. However they are also incredibly greasy so I can't see them being very healthy. This is the sort of thing that I will have to reserve as a special treat for myself every few months, and now that Burgatory is open right next door, I can really only recommend them if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Five guys burger patties are juicy, fatty, cheese-melty AND placed on buns that are soft, fluffy, absorbent and a little sweet. IMO, the taste of this thing is unmatched by no other joint. Nothing fancy. No gimmicks. Just tasty.

The \"small\" fries can feed, um, \"five guys\". Eat one serving by yourself though and it will raise your cholesterol to 900. Get the diet coke. No, wait, that won't work."}
{"text":"Closest thing to In-n-out here in Ohio. Definitely beats BurgerFi and I love how the burgers are always hot, fresh, and delicious. 

Knocking off a star for the always inaccurate online order times. It'll say my order is ready in the app, but then I'll get to the dead restaurant and have to wait 15 minutes? Confusing and pointless. 

However, this doesn't stop me from dining in! The fries are always so hot and yummy. When I'm feeling like dancing with danger I get the Cajun topping. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Simple, messy, you can even add a hot dog to your burger if you like, and free appetizer (peanuts). I prefer a messy inexpensive 5 Guy's over a expensive Bachi burger any day"}
{"text":"This was my first time getting five guys. Free peanuts won my heart! They also gave me extra mayo when i asked them and didn't make a big deal about it. Impressive that they are generous on their condiments."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good.  The burger was addicting.  I had to stop myself from eating too much.  Fries were tasty, we added more Cajun spice to it and I liked it.  The drink machines are lots of fun with very creative flavors that you wouldn't normally find.  Next time I think I'll want to have a little more fun with trying different toppings."}
{"text":"Great milkshakes.   I would love if the offered Turkey Burgers.  Our good was delicious.  The service was good."}
{"text":"Great service, tasty burgers and pretty clean. I've only ever had take out and by the time I get home the bread is always a bit soggy. Still worth it. Burgers and fries are made fresh which is great."}
{"text":"Pretty solid burger joint. Quality is always consistent. Price is a bit higher than average. All of their offerings are high in calories, I don't think there is an item here that's healthy.

Serving size is good, service is fast, and servers are friendly. 

I like how you can help yourself with some free peanuts while waiting for food. Refills are free on drinks. Washrooms are clean. Good solid burger place.

{"text":"I go to this five guys almost every week for a little cheese burger and fries because it is close to my job. The staff is so friendly and my food is always perfect. I will def keep going back."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here and the Cajun fries are awesome! The grease will seep through the bag though.. It's definitely not good for you."}
{"text":"First time there and it was really nice ! The price range is totally reasonnable! For 1 bacon cheeseburger, 1 cheeseburger, 1 small fries (way enough for 2) and 2 drinks we paid 17$ almost the same as McDonald. Food wise the experience was very positive. Bacon was crispy, meat tender and not too cooked and we could customize our burger. The fries are delicious, crispy and they arrived very warm. 
At the end we were super full and I'll definitely come back to 5GB!"}
{"text":"Great food and great staff.  Their credit card machine randomly stopped working and I had no cash, so they paid for my burger for me."}
{"text":"Update to previous review - went in again on 9/23 at 5:30.  Burgers were awesome..they always are..but either the workers are lazy and don't want to change the fry oil or its a cost cutting measure. .dark, oily, undercooked fries do not go well with the great burgers 5 Guys. The fries used to be great at this location.
*****2nd Update - I did receive a response from someone at 5 Guys, so hopefully things change, but at least I know that they know and they care enough to find out more.  That's a positive!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty yummy, we were pretty stuffed after eating here. I think I still like in n out a little better since I can get a double double, fries and shake for the cost of the smallest burger at five guys, but they definitely are better with all the free toppings. I had the little bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, grilled mushrooms, and grill onions. Bf had the regular cheeseburger (2 meat patties) with everything and green bell peppers. I'm not really sure why they flatten the meat when they grill it, maybe to cook it faster or fit the humongous bun?  We shared cajun style fries which were tasty--i think it's just seasoned salt on top. The soda machine is pretty awesome, never had to use a touch screen to get a drink before. Fancy stuff. I liked the free peanuts while we waited :)"}
{"text":"I got off work early today so I thought I would try some Five Guys food for the first time. I normally only give one star reviews to restaurants who had bad food or service and failed to try to correct the problem. In this case it's the business model that gets the bad review.

     I ordered a regular cheese burger meal and told the girl to large size the fries and drink. \"$15.69 please\" she said. I was sure I heard her wrong until I looked at the register screen. So I pay the ticket and start to watch them do their thing. When the food came up the fry cook shoveled a whole basket of loose French fries on top of my food in the bag. \"Why did you do that\"? I asked. \"That's the Five Guys way\" he replied. Even before he handed me the bag I could see the oil seeping through. (Picture Attached)

     When I got home to eat my food I had to remove an oil soaked burger from a mountain of loose french fries. My hand was literally wet from the oil........Gross City!

     Five Guys misses it in the three most important area of quick serve food, Price Point, Speed of Service and Presentation. $6.99 hamburgers, $4.99 French Fries and $2.49 sodas are not going to drive sales in this competitive market. Throw into the mix, made to order food you have to wait on that has oily french fries on top of it, and you get a pretty miserable experience. Their name and logo isn't even on their packaging. What a missed opportunity. Will NEVER return to another Five Guys."}
{"text":"Tried to go to this location last night (11/13/17) and pulled in front of the store at 8 pm. The restaurant was empty of customers and the workers inside, upon seeing us, promptly locked the front doors and began laughing with one another. The sign on the door clearly said they closed at 10 pm but I guess the workers would rather be on their phone and sit around rather than have paying customers. Never in my life have I been to a business with such unprofessional help and blatantly turned down for service for no apparent reason other than they were lazy."}
{"text":"Just had my very first bacon cheeseburger and fry from Five Guys, and it was amazing! They have two sizes of burgers, regular and little. This just means the regular has two patties and the little is just one patty. I ordered the little bacon cheeseburger and little fry, but there was nothing little about it. Plenty of fries come in the little order and they are the best fries I've ever had! You can top your burger any way you want from a list of free options. The bacon was crunchy and the flavor stood out on my burger, like it should. The manager was very friendly and explained a lot about the place when I told him I've never tried Five Guys before. The environment inside was very clean and organized. There was music playing over the speakers, which was enjoyable and set at the perfect volume. I will definitely be returning to this location when I want real fries with the potato skin on them and a great tasting burger."}
{"text":"My first experience with Five Guys was in DC and at the time, I wished for a location to open in Phoenix.  Wish granted!  My Mom and I visited the new place this week and I was not surprised to see it as busy as it was.  I had the burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, jalape√±os, and bell peppers with cajun fries and Mom had the hot dog with bacon and onion with regular fries.  We could have easily shared one small order of fries and I didn't make it through half of my burger, but what I did eat was perfection.  I was also thrilled to enjoy Cherry Coke!

If you're looking for a quiet spot to eat  your meal, avoid this place.  It's loud and hectic, but that's part of its charm, I think.  The people at the counter were really friendly and smiling, which was good to see.  Bonus?  A clean restroom!

I'm looking forward to returning to try the hot dog!"}
{"text":"Stop here about 3days ago.... Love it ...  The customer service was great ... And they give me some extra bacon on the side .... Will be back soon thanks five guys for making my lunch that day"}
{"text":"Not a bad burger but nothing special. Definitely not worth the 20 bucks I spent on a double cheese fry and coke. Fries aren't great and were way over salted. I most definitely won't return. You can get the same burger at any greasy spoon in Montreal for half the price. Save your dough. Cheers!"}
{"text":"On paye cher mais √ßa vaut vraiment le coup! Quel plaisir de manger un burger d'aussi grande qualit√©! La quantit√© est √©norme en plus!"}
{"text":"Well, this is a franchise I have been meaning to try for a while! Ever since I lived in SoCal, I wanted to try Five Guys! I have always heard that they are very similar to our SoCal favorites like In-n-Out. Five Guys just opened a new franchise in Surprise! I have lived in Surprise for the last two years, and have not seen as many youngsters at one place than the night I ate at five guys! It was nice to see everyone there having a good time eating dinner! First! the only thing that is similar between Five Guys and In-n-Out was the atmosphere or the ambiance? (Trying to includes some tricky words today?) Burgers are totally different. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger w/ BBQ sauce, grilled onions. Burger was very good, my honey had the cheese burger, and we shared a large fries! Here is some tips!
1) We had way to much food, If you want one patty! Order the little burger. Their regular burgers come with two patties!
2) Wife and I could have shared an small order of fries, their larger fries is enough for four people.

Other than that we had a great time, nice trying something new, and really nice seeing a place where people can hang out and have fun."}
{"text":"I think what makes five guys burgers so awesome is not the patty, but the melted cheese and the variety of toppings and sauces that are free of charge. I've always stuck with the little burgers cos that's more than enough for me (with all the toppings). 

Must try the Cajun fries. What's best is they always top it off with an extra scoop of fries regardless of which size you order.

Seating is alright, it's a fast food restaurant after all. Drinks are refillable. They also provide unlimited peanuts while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"Great burgers and outstanding fries! Everything was perfect and I love that they're open til 10 everyday."}
{"text":"Go to Burger King it's better than this store. Don't get me wrong I usually love 5 Guys Burgers but I've been to this specific restaurant twice and both times I've had bad experiences. 

First time they put one piece of lettuce on my burger. I was so pissed and felt that they were probably short on it so I didn't say anything. Really 1 small piece? Fries were also undercooked and soggy.  

Today as I was driving around I decided to try it again just in case they had a bad day on my first visit. I ordered the same as I have before when my order was ready I noticed my burger meat patty was so flat I didn't know if it was because they were messing with me or a training issue.  The bun was stale and the fries (you guessed it undercooked and soggy).  I am done and decided to just go elsewhere. 

Needless to say I will NEVER go to this store again. 

Management should focus on training staff on freshness and not pushing stale buns. Also don't flatted the patty to the point that you don't taste it."}
{"text":"First off I have not had give guys in about 2 years! Long overdue. 

I ordered online, was super simple to do! Order said it would be ready in 7 mins. I go in and pay and did have to wait another couple mins because they were making fresh fries. Can't complain when food is made fresh.

All three employees were very sweet and attentive, made sure I had everything I needed! 

Always a good experience and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Tried this in Tempe but in a quick moment of haste I asked for the works and it came that way - my mistake as I hate ketchup and Mayo on burgers as it disguises the flavors and both were included, but that was my fault.

Vowed to try it again and when I did I omitted those offenders and it was great.  Came out promptly, result was good, tasty and far better than the competition (In-N-out ).  Mid priced burger was good value and the burger seemed of comparable caliber for price.  The meat was flavorful, the bun soft and they sported crisp veggies.  Order was exactly correct on delivery. A bit pricey, but not that bad overall.

Free peanut starters are a real plus as you wait - somebody was thinking on their toes for both client's hunger and preoccupation.


PS - Note on comments that compare this place to In-N-Out , I do not consider them competition as I have seen In-N-Out as a filthy, dirty place where fries are scooped across the counter and back into the serving bin.  I searched on In 'N Out's website and it doesn't allow you to report it (like they don't care.  end of rant)."}
{"text":"A quick burger and some fries, this place looked like an In and Out burger joint with different name, or so I thought. Well, I was partly correct, the same, just not the same amount of hype. Dogs, burger and sandwiches, typical fast food faire. Ordered a cheeseburger, some fries and a coke. Got a bunch of toppings on the burger, just about everything except mayo. Well, I ordered and I got, more than should ever be on a burger, it almost made a side salad with mushrooms, peppers, onions, tomatoes and pickles. Anyway it made for one sloppy burger. So, it was a mess to eat but it was ok, I had plenty of napkins. Nothing special a burger with lots of stuff. The fries were ok to good, I like ketchup on my fries. I guess I got what I was there for, I left full or at least feeling full. Like I said, I usually do not stop for this kind of meal and when the feeling arises this could be a place to stop by. It would have to be on the way or nearby as I would not go to far out of my way.They seemed to be doing good business as it was quite full and everyone was chowing down and seemed happy, I think the peanuts help."}
{"text":"Always the best! Best burgers! Friendly service! Awesome soda machine! Always fast! Happy environment with loud fun music!"}
{"text":"Five Guys is expensive but absolutely delicious. I didn't have the same problem as some other reviewers -- the music volume was fine, and every time I've gone, the girl never has a problem hearing us. She reads back every ingredient we say to confirm it, and our orders have never come out wrong.

Let me get this part out of the way: it's not cheap and I'm pretty sure they know it! Before I praise it, just note that it's very pricey for a burger and fries. You can't exactly order the fries for a single person since it's a portion for two or three, and you'll pay over $20 for 2 burgers and 1 order of fries, $25 with drinks. While its very good (read below), my biggest gripe is that its at least 40% more than I want to pay, which is why my visits are few and far-between.

Okay, on to the actual food...

The burgers? Extremely tasty. Great meat, fresh toppings, and it all comes together beautifully. I've only ever had the bacon burger -- I'll amend my review if I try other stuff.

The fries? Not just tasty, but as any Five Guys fan knows, its a massive quantity. Read below to find out some extra perks about their service regarding their fries.

The atmosphere? Very pleasant. Everyone is very friendly, no one looks annoyed or grumpy behind the counter, and the place is very clean.

Other positives:
1) Unlimited peanuts is a nice touch. I don't eat many, but it's still cool. They are very fresh and tasty.
2) Seeing the entire assembly process right in front of you? I'm a fan of that.
3) One time, they accidentally charged us for 2 regular fries when we ordered one -- she just pushed the button twice in error. They gave us our money back for one of the fries AND told us to keep the extra order. Needless to say, 2 servings of regular fries is an absurd amount of food, haha.
4) My friend and I went there after work for take-out, about 15 min before they closed. Didn't even order fries, and still, they poured in a hefty amount into each of our take-out bags, on the house.
5) They are polite and forward enough to warn you -- the first time, the two of us went to order 2 burgers and a large fries, and she was like \"I wouldn't recommend that. The regular size fries are plenty for two people to share.\" So she was honest, and of course, she was right. Seeing all those fries in the bag the first time? Wow.

A few negatives / comments:
1) The burger can get messy depending on how you layer it -- don't eat it in the car or anything. Take your time, and order-in if you have the choice.
2) Don't get the \"cajun\" fries. They take their delicious signature fries and just dump a load of dry cajun spice all over them. They become too salty and too dry.
3) As I mentioned earlier, the price is fairly steep. Sure you get a lot of bang for your buck especially in terms of fries, but the cost adds up fast."}
{"text":"Great food, crap service. I went on one evening and I finally get to placing my order. I ask for a cheeseburger with onions and mayo. I got to ask for the next thing and before I can even say it the cashier cuts me off and reads me my total. I tell her I actually have more to order. She huffs and says what else you want. I say a large fry and large drink. She rings me up for a regular I'm both. I correct her and she rolled her eyes. Once again, I open my mouth to order more food and she cuts me off again and says my total. I say, again, I'm not done. Shocker, she rolled her eyes again. I ask for a cheeseburger with pickles, onions and mayo. She puts down only pickles. I correct her, again, shocker, another eye roll. She than says \"you done now?\" Oh. Ok sorry to inconvenience you by expecting you to do your job. How rude of me, I'm sorry Train your staff better and discipline the lazy staff that clearly don't want to be there. I get it, the food industry sucks to work in. However, I wasn't rude, I was quite polite despite her piss poor attitude. Again, great food, trashy service. I definitely won't be returning for a while. Side note, it's pretty gross to see the girls there don't have to keep their hair up while cooking food. Any other place you go, hair must be kept up and out of the way or I'm a hair net."}
{"text":"Burgers are good & made fresh. Way too many fries though. Small fries could cover 3 or 4 people. I've tried asking them to just give me a little... I like to have fries, but it's plain wasteful to throw so much away!"}
{"text":"I just don't get the fascination with this place. They don't do a bad burger but they also don't do anything special either and still charge too much for it. I don't think their quality is that much higher over say jack in the Box or In N Out yet it's $10+ for a basic burger and some fries.

Sorry but if you are going to charge premium prices don't make a sub-par burger, if I am paying $7 for a basic cheeseburger don't tell me the only way you will make it is well done. 

The fires are good but they aren't anything to write home about either, I do suggest them with the cajun seasoning though as it does add a little something.

The one plus they have going is free peanuts in the shell, not exactly sure how that ties into a burger joint but I still like them."}
{"text":"Simple, affordable and great food.  Good customer service although it is fairly busy location."}
{"text":"I dig five guys because of the quick service, great burgers, and tasty fries. I ordered a small, but I somehow received enough fries to feed five people, which I'm not complaining about.  I ate it all.  As for the burger, apparently a regular is double patty goodness, and this fat chick scarfed every bite down.  I love that the toppings are free, so I grabbed some onion, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and relish on mine.  Divine.

This place isn't crowded before 1pm, so grab one for breakfast when they open at 11."}
{"text":"First time trying Five Guys and wasn't disappointed. Their menu is vast, as far as burgers go, and everything sounded good. Tried their bacon cheeseburger and regular fries and was surprised by the size of the burger and quantity of fries. The burger and the fresh thick cut fries were very tasty. They even bring your order to the table, and check up on you...service expected from a dine in type of establishment, not a fast food type of restaurant. No complaints."}
{"text":"I like this place. Food is always good and you have the options to change and substitute things. Service is always ben great."}
{"text":"Two stars may be a little low, wish we could give half stars here.  But the burger was nothing special.  Lots of meat but nothing special.  The toppings were good and fresh but the meat could have a lot more flavor.  Disappointing as the meat is cooked on a griddletop. Be forewarned, they do not cook the meat to order, rather everything is well done.  They wouldn't like the burgers at my house!!  Now, I will say the huge serving of fries was very good, but I don't go to a burger joint for the fries."}
{"text":"Over Rated, Smash burger and Inn and Out is better ."}
{"text":"Had read great reviews of Five Guys so stopped by with my husband for a burger and shakes and some crunchy fries. 
They do not have shakes (that was a deal breaker right there), the burgers were being cooked up on a very filthy griddle instead of grilled over an open flame like decent burgers are. They were pulling some soggy fries out of the grease that looked gross. 
A cheeseburger goes for $5.99 (no cheeseburger is worth more than $3). 
We were so grossed out by what we saw that we left without ordering, so I have no idea how this stuff actually tastes."}
{"text":"The service is by far the friendliest in town, and in a place where it's hard to find friendly service, this place exceeds all expectations.  Tony the manager will always greet you, make small talk with you, and even invite you back for more tomorrow.
The food is over the top.  The burgers are huge (even the little ones) and the fries are HEAPING.  A little fry goes a long way for my 8 year old and me.  You can add any topping you want and it's all included.  And it's all made fresh in front of you.  If you are comparing In-N-Out, there's no comparison, this place is soooooo much better; quality, quantity, and absolutely the service blows them away.
The soda machines host any thing you want in any flavor.  Well, Coke, not Pepsi.  But you can choose other sodas in any flavor (my personal favorite is the Strawberry Fanta).
The leadership is often seen working along side the crew.  Yep, the district manager is there more often than not cooking the burgers, slapping condiments on, and visiting with guests.
It may be a little more expensive (a dollar more than most burger places) but you pay for what you get and this place you get more than you pay for."}
{"text":"Got burgers here and fries. They were slightly overpriced for what you got. Not a big fan of the greasy burgers. For the price you can certainly do better."}
{"text":"Pongo un estrella porque no queda de otra si no no pusiera   ninguna el servicio estuvo  bien pero la comida fue horrible no lo recomiendo a nadie es muy asquerosa la comida super asquerosa que asco"}
{"text":"First after reading the reviews I did notice the place was fairly clean when I arrived so that leads me to believe that the owner or management of this establishment did take note of such things.  

Ordered 3 burgers, 3 drinks and 1 large pack of french fries.  Came up to around $40.00.  All considered a separate order, which I am unaccustomed to seeing.  No options for combos? That's how they really charge it up!

Needless to say the burgers consisted of 2 thin patties and the toppings were listed at the cash so you couldn't miss out on all that they had to offer.  

I would simply come back for the Cajun fries, but the burger is nothing special and I know I could find something comparable if it better."}
{"text":"I've been a few times. I agree with Devon's review mostly. I also ordered something familiar and they did it OK. The boy(or was it a girl) at the counter seemed to lack simple menu knowledge. The meat was dry, a tad overcooked. 8 & a half bucks for a burger and drink, no fries. Classic rock played loud over the PA. Its like going to a bar without the liquor license. They call out your number when your food is ready. Lame. Nothing special. There are plenty of bars out there with a better burger. Keep driving."}
{"text":"aahhhh. just as i remember. i have been a fan since a few years back when i discovered them while down Baltimore from NYC. then when they opened in NYC it was over. burgers every week. now that I am in here in Las Vegas and they have opened my life is made. I will say I think 5 guys is better than in and out. from the cajun fries to all the free toppings. burgers that melt in your mouth. now be forewarned it is a little more expensive than in and out. i think it is worth it though. the employee's at this location were friendly. they also serve hot dogs. (and for the bacon lovers hot dogs topped with bacon! YUMS!) i have never ventured out of my burger love though. don't be afraid to grab some free peanuts while waiting in line and for your food. (yes, they are free. some people looked at me funny when i just grabbed a little box of them. when i told them it was free and to get some they were all for it though.) i know it is busy and a pretty hyped place right now, but wait in line. it's worth it.
so glad they have arrived in las vegas and just like nyc, it will be a weekly place for me and my burger loving mouth."}
{"text":"Came here to try just because I heard good things about this place...so decided last minute to go here for dinner. We ordered single patty burgers and fries. 
Pros: 
-clean environment
-good staff
-quick service
-good topping choices

Cons:
-did not feel \"full\" from the burger
-fries were too salty ... will get regular if we go again
-wished patties were a bit thicker
-not the most satisfying

Can't really say if I would choose to come here again, there are a lot of other good restaurants in the area that are in the same price point and more filling.
It was worth trying but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"As a burger person, I was really hesitant about trying this place, even though most of the people I know have done nothing but rave about it . So far I've eaten there three times, and each is better than the last. Fantastic friendly service, phenomenal burgers, and their fries, oh, oh their fries. Anyone who thought that In-And-Out Burger was the pinnacle of fast food epicuriousness, prepare to be amazed. Everything from the free peanuts in bags located around the store, to their beautifully designed iPhone app is top notch. Just a great, relaxing, fun, enjoyable experience which makes you feel better walking out than walking in. 

If you haven't tried it, please just do yourself a favor and stop by for a quick bite. You'll be as addicted as the rest of us in no time."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place, was working in the area and had a chance.

I ordered a hamburger (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle and mayonnaise), small fries and drink.

The drink machine was one of the mega machines, either had cherry Dr. Pepper or Cherry Mr. Pibb, whichever one they had there, I like that, gave an extra half a star for it.

The burger was good, it was a thick patty, by today's standard, as such to get the middle cooked enough for health reasons, the outside is overly done.

I ordered a small order of fries, they put them in a little cup, put that in the sack with the burger, then pour three times as many fries over the top of the burger in the bag. Tons of fries, I didn't finish half of them, I didn't care for them. If I had to point out the low point, it would be the fries, although they're fried, the texture was like they were steamed. No crispness, soggy, just a mess. If the fries weren't so pathetic, this could have been a 4 star review, 

They give you all the roasted peanuts, in the shell, you want, gratis. They were very good. I was a bit surprised by the peanuts. With the public uproar about peanut allergies, I'm impressed with them serving peanuts. If those fries weren't so bad, I would have given 4 stars just for standing up to the PC peanut people. In fact, give them another half a star for the peanuts, so this is actually a 3 1/2 star review."}
{"text":"5 stars for an upscaled fast food burger joint.

My daughter enjoys this place, and when we are in the neighborhood, we will lunch here.  Prices are obviously posted, so you know going in this is not a $1.00 burger.  But you get what you pay for, and Five Guys is no exception. Expect a simple starter burger around $4.5, big old bacon cheeseburger checks in at under $8.

EVERY time, the order is accurate.  The fries are made of REAL potatoes, served  very hot, fresh, super yum. One regular order easily  covers two people. 

I love how you can choose any number of add-ons and condiments and there's no extra charge- this includes extra cheese, grilled onions, grilled jalapenos, etc. And there's a huge assortment of condiments to choose from.  You can also get your burger wrapped in lettuce or as a bowl if you don't want a bun. The burger itself is made of high quality beef.

Casual environment, music playing when we've been there.  It's clean, employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"Haven't been in awhile to this location, now I see why. They weren't busy would have loved to seat outside but it was very dirty.. they should be sending there employees outside to clean..."}
{"text":"Man look...

I've heard many stories of this burger joint and finally had the chance to try it. Anticipating a meeting with heavenly beef, my hopes were set high. Before I could get my second foot thru the door, I was greeted with a welcome and a smile. I looked around and it looked homely. Nothing too fancy. More like an old hot rod without all the gaudy stickers...subtly hinting at \"this car's gonna dust you, but it won't let you know\".

The food: Again...man...look...I ordered the bacon cheeseburger w/ lettuce, tomato, & grilled onions. And fries. Gotta have fries. Because fries. Took my first bite and totally forgot about every other burger I'd ever eaten since living on the west coast. As ketchup ran down my chin and my cheekbones began to sweat from the all-beef patty experience, I had a couple well seasoned fries (big enough for a man's hands) and decided this was the one for me. Dood! The fries were everywhere! I felt like everyone in the building was staring at a caveman. Myself. Turns out they were all into their food just as much as I. I also got globs of ketchup on my phone as I live tweeted my entire meal. 

I'll be going back again. Great service! Great food! My meal ran me $12 including the tip I placed in the jar."}
{"text":"I love five guys. Every location that I have been to is consistent in their brand. I love the custom made to order toppings for each burger, with no add-on charge. Also, bonus for free peanuts to crack open and kill time while waiting for burgers. Fries are very good with a dip of ketchup. The soda dispenser had a fancy touch screen to select your drink. But there is only one spout for every flavor, so when I got a regular sprite it had a hint of vanilla flavoring. Very good burgers, but I will have to come back to try their hotdogs and shakes. Only downside is if you have a peanut allergy you cannot eat here. They use peanut oil, and peanuts..."}
{"text":"This is the only Five Guys location I've ever visited with any regularity. I come here only when I'm hankering for a burger (and they ARE good burgers), but this is by no means a default food stop for me. The amount of food you get for the price you pay is easily outclassed by Chipotle, which happens to be right next door.

The wait time is actually considerable; I wouldn't call Five Guys \"fast food\". That's not really a bad thing, since true fast food burgers are disgusting. Nevertheless, be aware that you could be waiting 15 minutes for your food, though you might not even notice as you ravenously eat their abundant supply of complimentary peanuts.

The decor is awful. I always feel like I am standing in an oversized public bathroom. Consequently, I've never had even the slightest desire to dine-in."}
{"text":"I came here as I was very hungry and ordered Cajun fries and Bacon Cheese dog with onions, bbq sauce and mushroom. It was still good when I made it home and was tasty and reasonable at around $11 . Also on a side note the bbq tastes great with the Cajun fries and I get sides of it whether I eat there or at home. Staff was friendly and efficient so food is around 5-7 minutes."}
{"text":"I've tried the Five Guys location near Old Port and both the ones on St. Catherine. They're all great. The burgers are filling and satiate hunger effectively! The toppings are kept fresh even late at night and the fries are soo good."}
{"text":"This 5 Guys is awesome and is one of the largest locations I've been to.  Very smart floor plan almost like a diner. Food is good as any 5 Guys . I especially live Cajun fries. Cajun fries are my absolute favorite thing about all Five Guys places. Custom soda machine is very cool as well. I ordered Bacon Cheese Dog and Cajun fries which were delicious. Prices are reasonable and I spent about $14. Staff is friendly. I recommend."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to give this place a try and I'm glad we did! The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was fresh and delicious. I ordered a cheeseburger and my friend ordered the bacon cheeseburger. We both really enjoyed them.

We were disappointed that the menu only included regular and little burgers. We were informed that the \"regular\" burgers were always two patties and the \"little\" burgers were one patty. How can you go wrong there? As far as I'm concerned the optimal burger to bread to condiment ratio is 2:1:1 so a \"regular\" burger here is perfect! 

We both ordered fries and the cashier asked us if we were sure? We asked why and he informed us that the large fries were REALLY large and we could probably just split an order. We said sure and looked at each other with a bit of incredulity but went ahead anyway. What the heck, save a few bucks.

When our order came up there was definitely enough for us to share and there were actually too much for us to finish. Too bad those excess tasty morsels had to be discarded.

The drink dispensers were high-tech and cool. Neither of us had ever seen dispensers like these and missed out on the different flavors available because of our unfamiliarity. I will definitely explore this further on my next visit. Vanilla Grape Orange Sprite/Coke anyone?

One final thought... I never saw 5 guys there. The facility was staffed by 2 guys and 2 girls. I'm good with that!

I may revise this in the future because I will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Simply put, the best burger I have ever had. Consistently great and superior to any other chain restaurant  by a wide margin."}
{"text":"My friend's daughter is an ex pat living in London. After taking her to visit her sister's grave I decided that rather than shop this Memorial Day I should take her to what  Europe lacks--a good American hamburger joint.  My first thought was B Spot but she has no idea who Mr. Symon is and it was the only place closed at Crocker Park anyway. 
 
We went to nearby Five Guys. My review is based on the delight she expressed.  She marveled over the size, the many toppings, the juicy beef. The huge pile of hot fries made her sigh. She loved the ketchup and the iced tea with fresh lemon. She wondered why nothing satisfied her as much in Paris or London or Zurich. I have received thanks many times in my life but rarely as enthusiastically over something so simple.

As much as it surprises me something good has come from Washington, DC."}
{"text":"I mean, it's good, but I wouldn't say that it is \"all that!\"

The atmosphere is wonderful, prolly the reason I stayed with 4 stars instead of 3.  They employees are lively using fun voices to announce the pick-up numbers and are happy to assist with anything you may need.  The customer service aspect is top notch and they are happy to put all the fixings on your burgers for you.  Everything is a la carte so be prepared, it's on the pricey side.  I got a Bacon Cheeseburger and medium soda and it was $9.00.  

Cajun fries are over-seasoned, but that's why I liked them so much.  The cajun seasoning was uber-delicious and so salty that it kept me going back for more. 

Also, they have Mello-Yellow...yeah, I know, AWESOME!!

There are free peanuts, good food, and a fun atmosphere.  I went here with some friends after an ASU home game and enjoyed it.  Like I mentioned earlier, it's good, but it's not the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Five guys is a great alternative to fast food burgers without getting mixed up in the world of \"gourmet\" burgers. Their burgers are very tasty and are available with a huge list of free toppings unlike most places at this level. Get some free peanuts while you're waiting for your order? Yes please. Although I enjoy the burgers, I think the fires are worth equal mention. They come in regular and cajun variety and I've never seen anyone who actually needed to order a large. The regular is plenty, even to share. The menu is pretty basic but they do have a hot dog and a grilled cheese option for those who aren't into burgers. I will say that for me it is kind of a toss up between Five Guys and In N Out, but I seem to find myself here more often."}
{"text":"Are you Kidding ?!!!! SUPER AWESOME BURGERS AND FRIES !!!!!!!!! Thanks five guys for the topping options  and the share of fries that are given no matter what size you order ."}
{"text":"When the price of your burger combo exceeds $10 you start treading into Vig, Delux, Farm House Grill, Indulge Burger territory.  And when you draw that comparison the Five Guys is out of its league.  The burger is good but is it better then In-N-Out, Lucky Boy, Culvers, or Two Hippies? All of those options would be almost half as expensive as Five Guys.

Sorry, I liked you better when you were an East Coast treat."}
{"text":"Very delicious cheese burger. The cashier is very helpful with your order. Place seems clean and fresh. As soon as you walk in you know food is good here. It was the bomb with flavors explosions in you mouth. We will be back. Thanks 5 guys and the girl that help us."}
{"text":"Definitely in the same league as Fuddrucker's & In & OUT.  No frills, but basic menu and a staff which provides A+ customer service.

Cool peanuts you serve yourself and crack right at your table while waiting for your burger.

Priced somewhere between In & Out and Fuddrucker's.  Not as fancy as Fudd's but the buerger you get is every bit as juicy.

5 stars and will be BACK."}
{"text":"I am a Five Guys fan...just not of this location.

There was a customer before me who was complaining about his order being wrong and he threw a fit and started cursing at the staff.  This entertaining and all but the same thing that makes you laugh will make you cry.  I got my 2 to-go burgers and got out of there only to find out the both of the burgers were wrong.

Complete fail, if a place can't get your order right there is no point of me ordering food from them.  Only because the fries were as expected they get 2 stars."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have heard of this place, but couldn't remember where. We gave it a shot today, and we liked it! 

First off a slight warning - first timers - \"Little\" burger options does not refer to kid sized portions. It refers to single patty burgers, as the regular burgers are double patties. (I was thinking they were for the wee tots, but after looking at the menu again, I became educated at what \"Little\" meant!) First timer mistake (but forgivable, right?) Anyhoo - moving on to the meat and potatoes!

I like the variety they have on their menu: burgers, hot dog, or veggies (and like their website says - NOT veggie burger patties). Would be cool to add chicken, but the name of the place says they are about burgers so that's fine with me.

There is a large billboard menu hanging above the cashiers, with all the options available for the burgers (or dogs), which clearly states free! (and let's face it who doesn't like free stuff!?!?!?!) I know other places would charge extra for anything! 

What's really cool to note are the HUGE 25lb boxes of peanuts that are located on both ends of the waiting line. You can just walk up and help yourself to some salted yummy peanut morsels while you are waiting for your food, or even with the food. Now they do have a sign requesting peanuts NOT to migrate outside out of consideration for those with peanut allergies. Seriously, have never seen any place with a set up like this before, and I love it! Very unique!

Now I'm not going to review the burgers, because well most folks here have done this already - and the majority have said the burgers rule, so I'm going with that as well. 

Fries - the regular portion is pretty large (let's put it this way - regular here is what large is at McDonald's or Burger King). Now the large - you get a tall cup that overflows with fries, and another tall cup amount of fries in the bottom of the bag!  There ya go potato lovers! (I was super happy to see the malt vinegar available to use... Very yummy with the Cajun version).

The staff will migrate table to table, making sure you are satisfied, and will give little papers and some crayons to the wee tots to keep them happy. A+ for the service and friendliness of everyone. 

The only ding for this particular location - and I know they can't really change it at this point- when the winds are gusting - and someone forgets to close the door - the wind does funnel through and things can start flying away. Staff will help remind customers by shouting \"close the door\" or something of that nature as newcomers come in or others are leaving.

That's it! We'll be back (but not just right away - got a good sticker shock after looking at the caloric intake of everything I had at lunch today!) Happy dining!"}
{"text":"Welcome Five Guys!!!! Great choice for a location - as there is a Fudruckers right across the street, that sucks. 

It's next to Paradise (also new) in a strip mall setting. The location is huge, clean, organized. Outdoor seating, shade, lots of tables, and great service. 

The only downside, and this is for all locations, the decor is too close to In-N-Out. Not something to count against a star being deducted. 

I gave them 4 not 5 stars because they are new and have kinks to work out. Yet have to be open for awhile to really \"wow\" people. When you have so many dining selections in the Arrowhead Mall area, you need to have somethin that makes me and other ppl say \"dinehere\".. 

They use real meat, not processed. Fry orders are huge, always a ton to take home. The seasoned fries is basically similar to the stuff they have at Red Robin or Chuys (for the chips). It's good. 

Overall a good burger. Yum!"}
{"text":"Read about this place in INC mag. Thought I'd check it out since I hear they may be in NorCal soon and I'm from Sac. Damn fine burger at a nice price. Got one with everything and it was huge and tasty! Staff was friendly and the fries were so plentiful I fed me and the homeless guy down the street. Rock on 5 guys. Come to Sacramento soon."}
{"text":"I had a cheeseburger and cajun fries. 
I liked the fries. Very good portion. 
The cheeseburger was ok. 2 patties and  2-3 slices of cheese. But the buns were cold and the patties were lacking flavor."}
{"text":"In-N-Out, Carls Jr etc eat your heart out,  These burgers are so much better!  The fries are amazing and a large will feed a small army!  I fell for this place on a trip back east last year and am so glad they have arrived in AZ!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure this place would be a 4-5 star review but suprised to see 3.5 stars as of 11.7.11.

The burgers are super tasty and you can put unlimited toppings including grilled onions, mushrooms, peppers, and the usual fixings.

Maybe it's because the burger gets really messy but I don't mind that.  I like to put A1 sauce on mine.

If you're going in a group I would order a regular fries to share for 2-3 people.  No joke - they fill up a big cup and the bag with fries.  Do not make the mistake of ordering 1 order of fries per person.

Everyone talks about the free penuts - it's a nifty addition.

Seriously, overall the value and quality of the burgers are good.  I am a huge fan and frequent here since it's close to my work."}
{"text":"I come here often as I make frequent trips to the Cineplex next door - I came in yesterday and realized that the cashier upfront forgot to note down that I wanted my burger in a lettuce wrap. I noticed this and told the guys prepping the burgers, they were quick to make the changes no fuss which was good. It takes a while so there is a bit of a wait and I don't think its the best burger option in town either but it isn't too bad either."}
{"text":"First ate a 5 guys in Tucson. Good place to go for a burger, fry, and shake fix. This review is for the one off Eastern in Henderson, Las Vegas. I was disappointed that they didn't serve shakes, something about they didn't have the milk shake machine yet. This is like going to a ball game with no hotdogs. Someone at corporate needs to get there $hit together. Kind of ruined the experience. I don't go very often so it would be nice to have the full experience. The staff is friendly, place is clean, will be back when they get there shake machine."}
{"text":"Alright, I'm not going to say much here other than I freakin love Five Guys Burgers. People say they love the peanuts there. Well what the hell people. Burgers, cajun fries, food coma, guilt, that's what you go there for. Trust me.

Burger and Cajun Fries: You just gotta love how they throw everything in the bag because they know you're just going to rip the bag open right away anyways.

Bacon Cheeseburger: If you haven't been to Five Guys before, your burgers are totally customizable. I'm a fan of lettuce, mayo, and jalapenos. You do what you like."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great portion sizes. Everything was perfect, best Five Guys experience yet!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I get it but it just doesn't do it for me. I'm a real burger fan and had much better right here at home ; )"}
{"text":"Ok, let me give the positives before I jump straight to a negative. I meant to write my review last night, as my son and I had dinner here yesterday. I used to eat Five Guys while living in California. My son & I love this place, and I love it for the fact that you get good burgers for a decent price. My son's biggest perk is the fact he gets to eat peanuts. He is only 4 years old. Anyways, I haven't been to Five Guys since moving back to Las Vegas last year. I was pretty excited that one was put in the Downtown Summerlin Mall which is right near my house. We walked in and the 2 employees at the register were very nice. We were greeted and helped immediately. I think we were here at about 6 or 7 pm? Anyways, I placed my order all was good. 

On to the negative. While sitting down with my 4 year old son waiting for our order to be completed the guy behind the counter yelled out \"ORDER NUMBER SIX\"..customer comes along and picks up his order. Next the employee yells \"ORDER FOR SCUMBAG\" I immediately turned around as I thought this was completely UNEXCEPTABLE. It was an employee on his lunch break being called a scum bag by the employee handing out the food! I'm sorry, but as a customer this is not acceptable, more so because my 4 year old heard this. I understand as an employee myself that you like to have fun with your coworkers, maybe you guys joke around and are ok with it, that's fine, I do it too. HOWEVER, this is not something you do in front of customers, let alone when your establishment is filled with about 4 families all with children under 10 years old. I would have asked for a manager right than and there, but everyone seemed a little too young to be management material.

I have zero complaints on the food, it was great like always. I'm just very disappointed at the lack of professionalism in some employees."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite hamburger joint in Phoenix.  The hamburger meat is juicy and tasty.  The toppings are fresh, but are the same toppings as a lot of other joints.  The meat is what makes this burger - it is simply fantastic.  The french fries are tasty and are best served with malt vinegar and ketchup.  The free peanuts are a nice touch and serve as a something to nosh on while the food is being prepared.  My favorite burger joint in AZ."}
{"text":"My last visit here was ok. Upon entering the establishment, I notice a pile of peanut shells on a table, which had not been cleared during my entire visit.

I ordered my usual of a little cheeseburger All the way with green peppers. The experience of eating the burger was the same as last time; juicy, flavorful, and enjoyable. Their consistency in their burgers is out of this world. Worth a visit, but don't mind the mess. Usually there are only 2-3 workers during the weekday, and with how popular the restaurant is, it does not seem that they have the manpower to clean the restaurant as frequent."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place over twenty times this year.  Almost always the food was s good. Actually it is the best burger place by far.  what sets it apart is all the choice of toppings for free including grilled mushrooms and A1 steak sauce.  I love the free peanuts too.  I have only received nothing but a top notch service from the employees here.  One time the burger meat was not warm which never happened before.  I voiced my concern and the cashier promptly ordered me another one free of charge.  Wow, I love the food here. Now I love this place. They have my loyalty for years to come.  Lee"}
{"text":"The food is ***** (5 stars) but I have to ding this restaurant for its atmosphere. I will only go there for take out.  The lighting has the ambiance of a parking ramp. Stark and cold. The kids working there are apparently allowed to play their music loud and I mean LOUD. This new restaurant is far worse in regards to atmosphere than its downtown counterpart. At least I live nearby and can take a warm burger home. There is so much competition for burgers in the area I am surprised. Fudruckers is going in down the street. That's a place I could sit down in for awhile."}
{"text":"Best burger in G-town. I have always loved 5 Guys and so glad when they came back a few years ago. They are worth every penny."}
{"text":"Charging restaurant prices for fast food : $11 for a plain burger and fries cooked THEIR WAY -well done - or the hwy.  The kids working behind the counter were very nice but there's nothing they could do about it.

Consumers (including Yelpers ) seem to hold low expectations for their money."}
{"text":"How would you rate a Starbucks that only serves light coffee because you know, black coffee could upset your stomach? 

Now that NC has finally repealed the infamous law I gave this location one last chance. Sure enough they only serve their burgers WELL DONE still!! Not even medium or medium well.  At least this time no one was rude about it. 

Even if I wanted it well done myself,  as a consumer I would have to wonder about a restaurant that doesn't trust itself not make its customers sick. Think about it."}
{"text":"The fries came out really fresh we tried both the regular and the cajun fries.  It's nice to buy a burger and not have to pay for every little topping that you put on.  The double cheese burger was very filling.  We also had a bacon and cheese hot dog and that was also very good but not as filling.  The staff was very friendly and walked around at least two times asking if we needed anything else and we where only there for a short time."}
{"text":"What can I say? These are some fresh, delicious burgers and fries. Everything is cooked to order so you may have to wait a few, but it's worth it. Simple, pure ingredients. They are my favorite french fries in the world and some of the only I can eat because of my soy allergy (soybean oil is used in fryers in 99% of restaurants). For those allergic to peanuts, avoid this place at all costs. They have peanuts for eating and use peanut oil in the fryer! Otherwise, enjoy a classic burger and fries!"}
{"text":"I have been to several of the Five Guys locations in Pittsburgh. The best ever lunch at a Five Guys was in the Atlanta Airport. Less greasy then most I have ordered. The Monroeville location is the one that the family has frequent the most. The downtown location is great for a lunch break during family business lunch time.  I am a little bias because of a family member once was a Manager of the Five Guys restaurant group. He has since moved on to somewhere else in the food industry. 
I am not always hungry for the juicy burgers that they serve, but I do order the hot dogs and I love the fries. I do like that the fries are cooked in peanut oil.  We have never ordered online, but I would think that most would find that convent if not eating in. Something to consider in the future. 
I like that they offer two sizes of burgers. The \"Big boy\" regular size and then the \"Little size\". Three sizes of fries and they offer a great BLT for those that aren't burger crazy.  All the toppings are free, load them up ! 
One more thing that I like about Five Guys, they are open seven days a week. Sometimes on a Sunday it's hard to find something other than fast food open late.  The Monroeville location is a nice clean and friendly burger joint."}
{"text":"Best fast food chain in the area. They're fast and have whole peanuts while you wait. Love the music too! Plus, they're open till 11pm every day."}
{"text":"If I am going to spend this much on a burger, I am going to go sit down and eat a good burger at say Gordon Beirsch or something like that."}
{"text":"Always a fan of this joint.  Call me lazy but grabbing a split hot dog with cheese in a couple minutes makes my life better. I guess things could be worse but I don't care! I love a single patty burger with fresh jalape√±os and mushrooms and whatever else I add on from there. It's a chain but I'm cool with it. Another hot dog pleas!"}
{"text":"My feelings are pretty much just a reiteration of what has already been said, so I'll try to keep it relatively brief.

The standard burger is 2 patties, and with cheese and bacon you're looking at just under $9 before tax. This was a pretty good burger, and my only complaint lays in that the bacon was overcooked and crunchy and lacking in flavour. The female diners I was with settled for the Little Burger or whatever they call the 1 patty equivalent, and thought it was perfectly satisfying still. 
Fries come in 2 sizes in either regular seasoning or cajun. Even the regular size ($3.49 pre tax) is more than you should need as they not only fill up the cup but also then pour a handful or fries into the bag so unless you plan on feeding a small family of 4, don't bother with the large. In fact if you even go with someone else, splitting a regular between the two of you will probably be adequate. 
Drinks are 2 sizes as well ($2.19 - $2.39 before tax), but are limited to fountain pop. Otherwise its bottled water, as they dont have any bottled juice or anything else, so hopefully you like Fruitopia if you don't drink pop.
Bonus cool factor gained with free peanuts! You're going to be waiting a few minutes for your food to cook, so why not indulge in some free peanuts while you wait.

All in all, a satisfying lunch and I'm glad I got to try it to find out what all the Five Guys hype is about... But there are actual restaurants where for $12 you can have a better burger and wash it down with a cold beer in a non fast food environment, so I doubt I'll be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who the 5 guys are, nor do I care, but on my way to the airport we dropped in for a quick (10 minute) bite before hitting the jet stream.

Damn, didn't we just eat In N Out like 3 hours ago? Yeah, but they serve Hot Dogs here. Yea! Okay, so I wasn't helping my diet any, but hey, I'm on vacation. No, not really, but whatever.

One hot dog please! What would you like on it? BACON! and?... Wow, tons to choose from!!! I'll have onions, mustard and JALAPENOS!

My friends ordered a burger and a grilled cheese and I sat back and watched as the \"guys\" made all our food from scratch.

Everything was tasty and the fries were IMHO perfect. The price was good, the portions good, the staff were good and the place was clean.

Yup, I'd do it again"}

{"text":"Frist time to this location and I was surprised by how clean this place. The bbq vents look like they were just installed. We got there close to 10 pm and the staff were cleaning up and I was really surprised how much attention they were paying to cleaning the store. Food was amazing. Meat was juicy and not overcooked. 

The lady that took our order was very polite and friendly. 

Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"One of the Best Fast Food Burgers Around. 

Im not typically a burger person.  However, occasionally I get a craving and Five Guys always hits the spot.  Five Guys is a chain burger restaurant but unlike any other.  The burgers at Five Guys are always fresh,hot, and juicy.  The burgers are tender, tasty, and well seasoned. In addition, to great burgers are Five Guys Fries.  Do not order a large order of fries.  The large of fries  is not large it is enormous, it is a lunch bag full of fries.  My nephew, sister and I barely made a dent in them.

Five Guys burgers are the closest you will come to burgers you cooked yourself.  Five guys allows you to  customize your burger with cheese, bacon, grilled onions, mushroons, and to many other toppings to name. 

If customizing your burger isn't enough, you can do the same with your drinks.  Five Guys soda fountain  has every coke product from mello yello to dasani water. You select your base soda and and then add flavors  like cherry, peach, or lime.  So you can customize your drink as much as your burger.   

 Prices are reasonable, employees are friendly and accommodating,  and the service is quick."}
{"text":"Five Guys. Thank God you're back in Gastonia (now please make your way back to Shelby, too). I don't know what happened, but a few years ago both the Gastonia and Shelby Five Guys closed but every other restaurant everywhere else was unaffected. Anyways, I've eaten here a few times and never had a bad meal. The burgers are always hot and perfect. Honestly, my only complaint is that I feel they're a little pricey, but they do let you load up a burger with everything, so I guess you just have to carpe the diem out of your burger and add grilled mushrooms, onions, steak sauce, etc. to get your money's worth.

Great fries, too. Really, really good. Like better than any fair good. Add in the cool drink machine (I don't do soda often, but I do have to get vanilla ginger ale when at Five Guys) and the free peanuts and you've got a winner."}
{"text":"My go to burger joint. I use their app to order. It's always ready, fresh and delicious. Great and friendly staff. Very Clean. Nice job 5 Guys"}
{"text":"My visit was on 9/9/12 on a Sunday. I *really* wanted to like the place since the chain has been widely successful and my friends never stop raving about it. Keeping in mind that the joint just opened a FEW days ago, all the flies made my first (and last) experience a bit uneasy. I'm pretty \"meh\" about burgers - I can get pretty satisfied with a dollar menu McDouble.

The fries were extremely hot AND just as soggy. Not good. The burger was so huge that I had no idea how to even eat it. It was pretty good even though it just fell apart after taking my first fail bite. Haha.

Why I don't want to return anymore is because I was eating a burger with my gf and we heard employees talking about their work. Don't get me wrong I worked with food for several years and there is always a time and place for backstage conversation which by the way is AT THE BACK! AWAY FROM PEOPLE! I just felt so uncomfortable after hearing the employees LOUDLY say \"Just do it the customers will never know the difference\" and \"They will never find out\" ..Uhh.. You literally JUST opened the joint  a few days ago and are already doing something shady? *shivers* This mystery could be anything from major unsanitary issues or simply be a tomato being sliced too thick or thin on accident. Who knows? Whatever. For all I care it's probaby something that would explain all the flies hopping around all over the place."}
{"text":"As a transplant from the west coast, this is as close as you can get to an In-n-Out burger on this side of the world. I wouldn't say one or the other is better as they are a bit different. The 5 Guys burgers are definitely a great burger at a decent price. Be prepared to wait if you come at mealtime, but it's worth the wait. Fries are good too and the malt vinegar is a good touch. Don't come here if you are allergic to peanuts!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about five guys.  I'm a big fan of In-N-Out and people told me that this place is a close comparison.  I went and it is not the case.  The burgers and fries were not bad at all but by no means are they In-N-Out or worth $8 per burger.  Honestly, I think Wendy's is better..."}
{"text":"I stopped by Fjve Guys today for a nice little cheeseburger! My bread was hard. Okay... this sounds crazy but when you order a five guys burger you can look forward to the bread being super soft with oozing cheese! Deliciousness (a little fattening too)! 

Anywho, this was NOT my experience today. Worst burger ever! My bread was stale!!!! Like super hard and overtoasted around the edges. I had to peal 1\"+ from around the edge of my cheeseburger. 

It was a mess... definitely disappointing considering it was my \"cheat\" meal  

(See photo)"}
{"text":"Pretty good experience. Definitely filled me up.
Me and a buddy went there yesterday, (Easter Sunday) after playing golf all day. Neither of us had much of a lunch and we tee'd off afternoon. We cruised in and checked out the menu, I like that you can add any or all toppings and the burger stays the same price, but for a guy like me who doesn't like all the BS that a lot of people put on a burger, it's all about the meet, bun and cheese for me, the rest is wasted stomach space. I ordered a Bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and ketchup and he ordered a burger with everything on it and we both got regular fries. Service was fast, cashier was friendly and she handed us our cups. 4 or 5 minutes later after snacking on some peanuts I walked up to our bag o burgers and thought  \"wow this bag is kinda heavy.\" So, I looked inside and all I could see was fries. WOW, that's a ton of potato!!!

After we ripped up the bag so we could get to the fries, we each ate about 2 potatoes worth of fryness and finally could get to the burgers. Honestly, this kind of annoyed me personally. I'm more of a burger guy than a fry guy so I wanted to get my hands on that and couldn't because of all the fries. But, in their defense they were in fact  pretty good so it wasn't a big deal. Next time I might not even get fries, depends how empty my stomach is.

I folded open the foil and thought WOW again. This thing is pretty big and awesome looking, hoping the flavor didn't disappoint because the site I was looking at was impressive. The thing was huge, 2 patties with bacon, cheese and onions just falling out of the sides. Greasy deliciousness staring back at me. I picked the thing up and took my first bite and it didn't disappoint, the crisp of bacon, thickness of the patty, the gooey cheese, and the crunchiness of the onion was a great blend for me. An excellent burger! We decided that it was one of the greasier burgers we'd ever seen and devoured, but was definitely delicious and well worth it as hungry as we were. I commented how I needed to go run a few miles after inhaling all of those calories and my buddy said \"run a couple for me\" HAHA

All-in-all a pretty good experience, food was above average, price was a little bit high but maybe they justify that because they give you about 2 pounds of fries for the regular size."}
{"text":"Amazing Burgers... Bad Fries

I absolutely love the burgers here. Theyre very juicy, cooked just right and they have a wide aray of options for building your burger. Personally, I like putting the green chilli peppers on my burger. However, every time I order the overpriced fries her they always turn out soggy and greasy which is a big turn off for me. Although I often just order it to go and eat the burger at home with some chips or a side dish to complete the meal. 

When you order you can expect to pay a pretty high price relative to other burger joints and the wait is longer than average."}
{"text":"This chain is expanding like crazy across canada

They make a good burger and fries with some other items on the menu

This is not an artisan burger place like The Burger Priest or Crafty Burger @ King West

It is big a step above the fast food burger slime  franchises in quality, taste and real ingredients

Spend a few bucks more and get a real hamburger at Five Guys

Cajun Fries are highly recommended"}
{"text":"Having been raised in Southern California, I realize that it's blasphemous for me to say that I prefer Five Guys over In-n-Out. But, I'm putting it out there: I like Five Guys better. Eek. 

Unfortunately, since moving to Toronto from Seattle (where they've only recently gotten a couple of Five Guys restaurants), my life has been somewhat bereft of a good fast food burger. So, when I found that my rental apartment in Montreal was a block away from a brand spankin' new Five Guys, I was jazzed -- even in a neighborhood sprawling with amazing food like Vieux Montreal. 

However, if you're familiar with the rest of the Five Guys chain, this particular location leaves a bit to be desired. It's probably because the place has recently opened and they're working out a few kinks, but the kinks are pretty big ones:

1. Sloppy burger. My burger appeared to have been put together by flinging the components across the room, only to be haphazardly assembled and wrapped. You know how at a casino, the dealer spreads out all the cards in an overlapping row? That's what my burger was like. Plus, the cheese wasn't completely melted. Not typical of the Five Guys burgers I've had in the States.

2. Inconsistently cooked patties. Of the two patties in my cheeseburger, one was overcooked and the other was not cooked enough; it was medium rare, erring on the side of rare. While medium rare is how I would cook a burger at home, it's a little disconcerting to get one at a fast food joint. Again, not typical of the burgers I've had at Five Guys stateside.

With that said, it's still a decent burger. I don't know if Old Montreal is really the best place for this kind of restaurant, but either way, as long as they can work out these issues I think it'll be a solid place to grab a burgery bite."}
{"text":"Great juicy burgers. Yeah it can get pricey but you'll see why when you take that first bite. Try your burger with some grilled peppers. Guaranteed delicious. I usable get the small fries because they fill up the bag anyway. When you want to splurge for lunch, come in by. This location is always clean and they are fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was good. However I got a silly response when I asked for well done fries. The register guy said that they couldn't cook well done fries, because they were made in peanut oil, which is stupid because I work at chick fil a and that is a common request that we make for any guest.  Disappointed, especially because other five guys restraints prioritize their guest. Won't ever come back to this location. Also everyone in the restraunt was complaint about the overly loud music.  

Thanks guys with the glasses

bacon cheeseburger came with cold, unmelted cheese on it and NO bacon.
took it up to the counter, the guy put 2 pieces of precooked bacon in a piece of aluminum foil and handed that to me.
I got back to the table, found that the bacon was cold too.
brought it back again, asked them to remake the whole thing.

My husband just picked up two burgers, a hotdog, a grilled cheese, 1 large fry and a small milkshake, and it came to just over $40! The fries were literally $5.99... and the shake was $5. I don't mind paying $7-$8 for a better burger, but I don't know how they can justify charging those prices for fries and a shake? My daughter's hot dog was about $4. It's just very excessive. The food is definitely better quality and taste than McDonalds, but if you're going to eat here, be prepared to spend a lot. And from what I understand, they don't offer \"meals\" so you pay individually for everything and it really adds up. We probably won't eat here again."}
{"text":"$ 18 
1 patty bacon cheese
2 patty bacon cheese
1 fries

thin patties (a little thicker than mcdonalds patties)
chopped white onion (i like sliced thin red)
bread was falling apart 
cheese is like kraft american cheese ( i like sharp cheddar)
fries are huge portion. & the skins left on. they were really really good.
thick, not shoestring. 
not too greasy.

i'd rather make my own burgers."}
{"text":"This joint happened to be close to where I'm staying in the city. its also one of the few places in the area open after 9pm. 

The place was happening. I realized later its a franchise in the city. I ordered one of their few vegetarian options, a grilled cheese sandwich with grilled mushrooms. And a side of cajun spiced fries. Both were stupendously good (and stupendously unhealthy). My grilled cheese consisted of two slices of 'bread' (more like savoury pancakes) with heaping amounts of cheese and mushrooms dripping out. The serving size was smallish (imagine a slightly overstuffed egg mcmuffin) but very filling. In comparison they overfilled my serving of fries (and I ate every single one...oh what a carb feast).

It will cost you around $10-12 for a main, fries and drink. I wish they had poutine options, guess I will have to save that tasting event for another local establishment :)"}
{"text":"this place is busy!! a new franchise for the city. i got two burger and an order of cajun fries. 

the staff work fast and its cool to watch them putting the burgers together as you wait. there are free peanuts. serving size of fries is VERY generous. after filling the cup with fries, they add an additional heap on top...whoohoo!

the 2 burgers was part of a 'BURGERS study' tonight. my friends and i sampled burgers from five guys, burger priest, st.louis, hero burger, and chuck burger (from hamilton). ratings scales in hand (we are total nerds) the five guys burger came out at the top for 2 people. i rated the hero burger the best (love their patty) while other considered its flavouring artificial. the st. louis burger was surprisingly good considering its not really a 'gourmet' burger', more of a pub place. burger priest gets special mention for the chunk of fried breaded cheese added to our burgers...very tasty but incredibly heavy.

all in all, I thought the five guy burger was average but their fries were the bomb. for the best burger in town it really does depend on your taste preferences! I would go to hero for an easy but quality meat fix. and i would save burger priest as a treat!

there are a few other places we wanted to try but sadly the stockyards was closed by the time we were picking up our food. another good place ive heard about is burger press. will keep these two in mind for future studies :)"}
{"text":"Five Guys has always been one of my top favorite burgers but I have recently found out I have a gluten intolerance.  My family and I got takeout from here and told them about my gluten problem and the guy working was very understanding and made sure he cooked the burger away from any contaminants which was appreciated. They really take any allergies very seriously. They put my food separately from the food that contained gluten and they were kind and didn't act put out when told about my gluten problem. The food and service here is excellent and it's so nice having a place to go to that is gluten free and tasty! I will definitely be back- keep treating customers with the kindness you do and keep having the great consistency with your food and you guys will stay great!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick lunch.  I don't consume any bread products so a burger is a real treat.  I was very disappointed. Asked for a bacon cheeseburger and asked if it was \"real\" cheddar and not that processed \"fake\" cheese.  I was told it was real cheddar, which it was not! For $9.69 I expect real cheddar.  They made me a new one, without the cheese.  It was an average burger, nothing to say I would consider coming back especially as a cheat food."}
{"text":"It's always a toss up between In-n-Out and Five Guys when my boyfriend and I are trying to choose where we want to grab a burger. 

I usually get a little cheeseburger (little = single patty at Five Guys) and add mayo, grilled mushrooms, raw onion, tomatoes, pickles and lettuce. But the best thing about their burgers is you can easily choose from their list of items the things you like. I have never had my order come out wrong.

The other awesome thing about FG is the regular size fry is more than enough for two people to share. I also love their new soda fountain dispenser-- it has a touchscreen LCD display, and you can choose from many different combinations of Coca Cola like diet Coke with cherry or Coke with orange-- pretty fancy if you ask me! :)

I am also a big fan of the employees and managers here. They are always friendly and helpful, and always come around to the tables to make sure everyone's food is alright."}
{"text":"HATE this branch. There's something wrong with their phone, so if you're ordering by calling in you can't hear anything they are saying. So, they heard my order wrong and I could barely hear them when they read the order back to me. Had my boyfriend pick up the order and they heard me COMPLETELY wrong (not sure how you could have gotten \"bacon cheeseburger\" out of \"cheeseburger\" but ok). He politely told them the order he received was wrong and apologized for the miscommunication. They were rude to him and acted like they were doing him a favor. If you don't want this kind of thing happening, fix your phone and don't be rude to customers over a miscommunication."}
{"text":"Great food!! I love their burgers and the fries are awesome I tried the cheeseburger all the way and is fantastic"}
{"text":"Not at all impressed with all the hype. Food was good but definitely not worth the price. I won't be coming back. The only thing I liked was the bottomless fries."}
{"text":"Yes, their burgers are great!  There, I said it.  I'm not a burger lover.  So, take that with a grain of salt.  I'd usually stay away from chains, but on a long drive through Phoenix, I just wanted to drive by and see what downtown looks like.  It's a Saturday after all, and the usual crowd I figured would be away.
Come for the burgers; made in different ways the way you wish.  The fries are great, too.  I didn't get a chance to read Yelp before hand, so we ended up ordering two small fries.  The brown bag was so heavy with about 2 lbs of fries.  The good part, they are good, too.
I liked that they served several types of tea.  Plus point for that.
I was worried about the signs posted all over the restaurant, though.  Is this really their ambiance else where?  Someone join me in telling the chain to get rid of the testimonials by newspapers and magazines on the walls.  It's okay to be good, but tacky to use clippings all over your walls saying so."}
{"text":"It's mostly a burger joint, similar to Fatburger or Johnny Rockets.  Though they do offer a few other menu choices.

The staff was friendly and helpful.

I had a burger (regular) and fries.  The regular burger was pretty good sized because they do TWO patties.  I like that.  Makes the price a little more palatable.  Burgers are fried on a griddle.  I really prefer my meats to be cooked over actual fire, but that's not an option here.  I went with it anyway.  It is cooked fresh when you order it, and you can get any combination of toppings you want (or none at all, if you prefer).  The burger was pretty good.  Not great, but pretty good.

The fries you can get one of two ways.  Either \"plain\" with just salt (like just about any other place would do) or with Cajun seasoning.  I opted for the latter, and they were really very tasty.  They post on a white board where their potatoes came from that day.  No way to verify if it's real or not, but it was an interesting thing for them to do.  They really do mound the fries up.  I ended up with more than I expected, which was a good thing!

While you wait they have a box of peanuts you can help yourself to.  I grabbed some.  They tasted old.  Not bad.  Just not really fresh.  I've been to other places that do this, and these definitely weren't as fresh as I would expect.

This wouldn't be my first choice for a burger, but they're pretty good.  I'd take Johnny Rockets over them because of their fabulous chocolate shake.  But if JR isn't nearby this place will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not a lot of flavor.  The meat didn't even taste like it had salt on it."}
{"text":"I bought the hype and decided to give this place a try after meeting up with a friend over lunch since it is a midway point between our two workplaces.

The food there is not cheap and they align themselves in pricing with the many other \"gourmet\"  burger joints that have sprung over over the past five years or so.

I didn't really pay attention to the grilling method of the burger which I could easily have done with the open kitchen concept but the burger I got lacked flavour and juiciness. Needless to say, I was disappointed.

The fries were pretty good but didn't really stand out from the pack.

Service was friendly, lots of people were there but I don't think I'll be back.  At least I finished it and was full afterwards."}
{"text":"Yes... yes.... YES!!! This, my friends, is how you make a burger.

I'd been hearing great things about 5 Guys for some time now, and the second I even looked in the front window, I have to say I was skeptical. Everything aesthetic about this place is almost jaw-droppingly bland and unimpressive. The lineup area is lined by stacks of potato bags (see the picture I posted), their overhead menu is a lot more lacking in options than a lot of places and has ZERO pictures, bold color choices or any sort of design flare at all, and the dining room is so basic and unimpressive it almost appears it HAS to be deliberately done that way. Combine this with the open kitchen style, high ceilings and lack of significant decoration and (this location at least, as I've yet to visit their other Calgary restaurant) looks like somebody took some old warehouse space and spend the bare minimum necessary to turn it into an eating establishment.

But hey, this many people can't be wrong, right? The proof was in the pudding... well, the burger (this place sticks FAR too closely to the menu as suggested by it's title to offer anything as bold as pudding.) The burger I ordered, simplistic as it was in it's list of toppings, was still so large my mouth strained to get around it, but didn't fall into the usual trapping a lot of these \"thick patty\" burger places do, of making it thick but sacrificing width and essencially giving you a half-flattened meatball on a bun. I watched intently as every step of my burgers build was executed - from the bright pink (FRESH!) patties being thrown on the grill, right until the moment they were placed on the bun already heaping with toppings (which you choose from a list up on the menu board, almost Subway style, rather than choosing from pre-designed burgers and having to ask to hold ingredients, and are free and unlimited.) And was so thoroughly impressed, by the time I was handed the bag with my order in it, my mouth was watering.

Now, the fries... these things are an experience in and of themselves.
First of all, a warning: order less than you think you're going to
eat. In fact, I'd say a \"regular\" order of fries are more than enough
for two people. The reason? You know when you open a bag from a place
and some of the fries have fallen out of the cup/box? These guys do it
deliberately. After putting the (already quite large) cup of fries in the bag, the employee then took the fry scoop and tossed a bunch more in over top, so all told I ended up with almost twice the ammount of fries I thought I was getting. These fries are just like their burgers - made the right way, there in the store, big and fresh and ready to amaze... though maybe a little on the salty side.

The one and only thing I can think of I'd like to see from this place is a little more variety in the drink department, especially a milkshake system similar to Boogies or Peter's as this is really the only thing these two burger mainstays have over Five Guys, in my humble opinion.

All in all, don't expect your eyes to be blown away... but if you're a real burger lover, your tastebuds will be. I'll be back far more often than I probably should be.

CAUTION: PEANUT PRODUCTS
Those with severe peanut allergies may want to stear clear, as peanut oil is used on the premesis (I assume in the friers) and there are boxes of peanuts in the lineup area for people to snack on while their orders are cooked."}
{"text":"The Burgers & Fries are good.  I like that you can see them squish a ball of meat on the fryer.  It's not a frozen patty.  The fries are good and plentiful.  For those of you who don't eat much you may want to split an order of fries with a friend and their \"Little' burger is a single patty.  Their regular burger is TWO patties.  People have said the food is \"Expensive\" but you're going to pay more for fresh cut potatoes and fresh ground beef."}
{"text":"The meat is excellent...bun soggy and not so good...toppings fine, fries a bit soggy...overall fine

Staff was having a good time...

The 2nd visit...tried the lettuce...mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm greasy lettuce...If they would just perfect their bun, they would be great..."}
{"text":"This is the best location, they have friendly service and it can be jammed here at times. But the service and the food is a must.  Gotta check this place out. I love their coke machine you can miz flavors and we're in love with half strawberry and vanilla it's kind of like a jolly rancher."}
{"text":"Great beefy burgers, fast service and I love that they have a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine. Little pricey compared to other fast casual burger joints around, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I felt bad coming in 10 minutes before they closed but the staff was very nice and didn't get upset like most places would. The food was very delicious and fresh! This place has great food and great service!! The two ladies there were very helpful and made sure I had everything I needed. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"5 guys is good but not GREAT! I can't really jump on the same bandwagon and say that I absolutely love this place. I was in the mood last week for a great burger and didn't feel like driving to IN-N-OUT Burger, I had decided to come here because I haven't been in a while. So for starters the service was great and that's why they get 4 out of the 3 stars I would've originally gave. Patience is key and the cashier had plenty of that with me because I was so indecisive about what I actually wanted. Finally the double cheeseburger with everything on it with some A-1 sauce sounded great, threw in some of the seasoned fries and decided on no drink! Be ready to spend almost $15-20 for your ONE order because everything is a la carte. I would like to return one day and try the hot dogs"}
{"text":"Yeah, it was high quality beef, but the fries were overpriced and mushy, got so many orders wrong I just enjoyed my free bacon and ask for more mustarrd and lettuce. I still like Carl's Jr sandwich with no bun, and wrapped in lettuce for fast food, and Joes Farm Grill is worth the drive for many many reasons.
It was nice, but very self serving since all the decor was of the \"LOOK we are awesome\" $24 for 2 burgers fries and a drink is great. (and the bun couldnt hold up the bread, which was kinda weird, it just decenigrated.
Friendly folks, Diet Mr Pibb, good music, and... overall, I recomend it if yur in the area and want a step up from drive through.)

The big deal is free condiments, but they were all sorta spartan and bland, even when I ask for a stupidly huge amount of stuff
If I find myself back there, I'll ask for well done fries and see is that helps"}
{"text":"MMMM Five Guys.  So happy you're in Canada.
Very friendly reception here.  The staff are really friendly.  Big smiles, and welcoming.  
If you have not experienced their hamburgers and fries.....you're missing out.  GO.  GO NOW!   LOL.  
Bring an appetite.  Lots of food."}
{"text":"Like you simply have to!  They load you up with so many fries, and it's a big juicy burger.  Recommended!

Review 2: this place never disappoints.  Huge amount of food for not much money."}
{"text":"their customer service is great, as far as the rave about their burgers? well I'm giving them 3 stars. They were average, nothing special. Just a bigger patty with overloads of toppings. The bread was really fragile and fell apart as soon as you take a bite. So a bit messy. I'd say better than a fast food burger, like Carl's jr or jack n box, but not better than IN N OUT! plus they cost 3x more expensive than IN N OUT."}
{"text":"It wasn't awful but it wasn't the best burger I have had. 
It is way better than Boardwalk Burgers and I would go here before them anyway but for a burger and being fast food I prefer A and W or Wendy's or going to a restaurant. 
I would also go to this place before I would go to McDonald's. 
Again, it wasn't bad it just wasn't my favourite."}
{"text":"Have been 3x since opening and the food is great. The store appears clean but the staff rings what could maker it a 5 start. In all my visits since opening (so I know it's not just a bad week) I honestly have NEVER seen even 1 employee smile.  VERY UNFRIENDLY STAFF FROM  the time we ordered til we left"}
{"text":"This is basically how my experience goes when I visit a Five Guys. *opens bag* \"Want some burger with those fries?\"

However I can't complain. Fries are bombastic and the burgers are amazing."}
{"text":"It only got a star for the Cajun Fries.. the burger was dry and tasteless. Would not have eaten the except for reviews of other people on yelp. Very disappointed with my meal, don't waste your time here. Try the CaveMan burger or Rehab Burger Therapy for delicious real hamburger. Seriously don't waste your time at Five Guys."}
{"text":"Five guys: Good burgers, even better fries, and a 100% guilty pleasure. 

I seldom eat burgers outside as I prefer to make them at home but I'm happy to have finally try five guys. Their burger is just a classic hamburger. Never frozen beef, double patties, good ingredients. It tastes delicious, is just a mess to eat, and it's just a good burger from the top bun to the bottom bun.

The best thing here were their fries! Super crisp, skin-on, their hand-cut fries were amazing. I actually ordered their small size, the 'little', to save some calories, but they ended up giving you essentially what would be considered a medium anywhere else. They were so good I finished them all.. psst, if you're health conscious like me, their fries have even more calories than their burgers - which are already pretty high (Just a FYI). But you're probably telling me, who cares, right? Yup. You probably shouldn't eat this more than twice a month.. but go indulge! 

Prices are a bit steep for a burger and fries, and unfortunately they don't offer any combos for the faithful. Although I didn't pay $18, to get away with their 'little' fry and a normal burger for $12.75 isn't too shabby nowadays!"}
{"text":"The fries are bomb and they have malted vinegar and that's the best way to eat fries."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've been here over 10 times now and I am never disappointed or left feeling full. Their menu consists of a hamburger (two patties), cheeseburger (two patties), little hamburger (one patty), little cheeseburger (one patty), hot dog, bacon hot dog, cheese hot dog, chicken burger, veggie burger, fries, and drinks. I normally get a little hamburger and small fries (which I think comes to ~$10) and it's probably one of the best burgers I have gotten from a place that doesn't charge $20 per meal. They also give you SO many fries (when I have gotten a small, I have always shared with at least one other person). They have free refills on their drinks. 

The people there are super friendly and efficient at what they do. Oh, and they have peanuts for you to eat while you wait, which I haven't tried, but everyone is eating those whenever I'm there so they must be good. The place has a retro yet somehow updated feel to it and would be a cute date place for a younger couple. It's also good for families."}
{"text":"I haven't tried many burger joints (other than Wendy's and McDonald's of course) but I have to say that the patties for the burgers are so tender and juicy! The prices are a bit high though. Other than that, I would definitely come back and try their other items."}
{"text":"Decent burger, great toppings and drink selection...but no milkshakes at this location :("}
{"text":"Mountains of fries, no matter the size.  Seriously, they give you a laughable amount of fries.  Awesome burgers, a top 3 chain cheeseburger hands down.  High quality fresh beef, grilled fresh while you wait.  Get it with everything on it, add bacon.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"When it comes to fast food burgers, Five Guys is at the top of my list!

Once you walk in, you're instantly greeted by a pretty loud roar from all the employees...\"THREE IN THE DOOR!\". You can then make your way towards the line of potatoes and grab some free peanuts to munch on while waiting for your food. There's only a few choices and the burgers can be ordered with any number/combination of toppings you choose. The fries come in a few sizes but even the smallest can be shared as you end up getting a bag full anyway.

When it comes to the burger, I can't think of any fast food burger in town that I like more. I get mine somewhat simple and order the bacon double with grilled onions & mushrooms, mustard, jalapenos and extra cheese. When they make it right, which they usually do, this is a ridiculously good burger. The meat is tender, juicy, flavorful and reminds me of a homemade, grilled burger. For a fast food joint, the toppings always seem extremely fresh and they have really good jalapenos. The fries are also super tasty, both the Five Guys style and Cajun style. 

As a fast food spot, they'd easily deserve 5 stars if the prices weren't so high. It's not hard to spend over $20 for two people, even when sharing fries and a drink. But they do have good food, their employees always seem friendly and helpful, plus they have the cool soda machines which are fun to use. I'm a Five Guys fan and will continue to come back when I'm craving a good burger!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers and love their fries! Place can be a bit messy sometimes, but nice staff everytime I go there."}
{"text":"Excellent burger joint (chain from the states)
Everything is made fresh in front of you, burgers can be piled high with delicious toppings and portions are amazingly large!!! (one small fry easily fills 2 people)
The beef is so tasty, if you close your eyes, you're eating a steak!!!
Prices are fair as quality far surpasses any fast food places around, so completely worth it (you can have a good meal for about $10 per person.)
The fries are tasty and obviously made form real potatoes (you can see some skin on them!)
Peanuts in shell as an appetizer, good while waiting, very fast and efficient service.
This is not a health food place, so I wouldnt recommend it everyday! But if you're looking for a burger fix, this is the place."}
{"text":"Barely edible. not being used to fast food, I found this food to be icky. 
The service was spectacular. Oh how I wish I could remember the name of the young man who took our order. Funny, friendly and cute too!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE! As much as I like In n Out, this place is even better. The burgers are amazing, and free toppings? Who can complain. I love the fries. Even if you really wanna pig out, the regular order of fries can feed two people. and BULK PEANUTS?! I think yes. They have the Coke Freestyle machine, which is just pure soda bliss. They have malt vinegar up by the ketchup, too. Oh, and I love that the managers work with their employees. Some restaurants you'll never see a manager, but at Five Guys they make sure to see how you're doing, how your food is. Not a freezer in the place, and they say what farm the potatoes are from. It's a really neat and relaxed place."}
{"text":"I have been to Five Guys several times. I really like the burgers, I never eat fast food burgers like from any of the major chains.
The Five Guys burger is made to order using a fresh patty, they have a large selection of toppings, I like my burger with everything! The French fries are really good too they taste homemade. Overall Five Guys is on my top 5 burger places in the GTA.

{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised by the service here. While I always get treated well at Five Guys, the cook thought he gave me too few fries (I did not notice) and thus proceeded to give me a large servings worth. He continued to check up on my wife and me during our trip. And as always the food is top notch. Well done, just like their burger temperatures!"}

No chili?!

All 3 of our cheeseburgers were mistakenly made doubles. After taking the extra beef patty out the burgers were just sloppy, soggy messes. Just gross. Definitely wont be back...YUCK!"}

Good burgers and Cajun fries but Boiling Crab still has the best Cajun fries. 

I like the appetizer peanuts that they offer while waiting for your order."}

The interior is pretty casual like a retro diner. We got there around 11:30am and about 5 tables were already taken. By 12:10pm, this place is bustling with traffic.

Order comes fast, and they don't skimp on ingredients nor quality. Burgers are about $4-5 and fries are about $2. It's kind of a toned down version of Denny's.  I will definitely go back to it.

Btw, there are exactly 5 guys working there. I suppose if they need extra staff, they'll have to hire women. =P"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have been to a Five Guys restaurant. I guess I expected more after reading all the excellent reviews. It was hard to order because everyone except the girl at the register was yelling. Thinking back now, she is probably the only one who should have been yelling! We took our order to go because it was a little too loud for our taste. The burgers tasted good but really not worthy the prices they charged. The fries were a little soggy and expensive. $25.00 for two average size burgers and two fries was a little high for a fast food place. I really hoped the taste and value would be better or equal to In and Out Burger!"}
{"text":"This place gives Swensons a run for its money as Akron's burger king (note how the B and the K weren't capitalized).  Although this is a national chain based in the DC area, Five Guys is pricier than most burger joints in the area, but it's totally worth it.

Five Guys is known for three things:  the peanut box everybody sticks their filthy hands into, their burgers, and their fries.  Because Akron loves grease and cholesterol more than most cities, you can understand why this place has been so successful.

The lines, whenever I've been here, have been excessively long.  That doesn't stop people from coming here despite not having a drive-thru lane.  While they are constantly working, the staff here is friendly and knows how to cook their food to perfection.  I've seen shows about how they make their food.  To sum it all up:  everything is American-grown or American-made, and freshness is key.  The burgers are tender and juicy, while the fries and salted just right.

How you order a burger is different here.  You start off with the type of burger you want as well as the size of drink and fries you prefer.  Then, you order each topping, starting with lettuce and tomatoes and ending with barbeque sauce, jalapenos, and so forth.  I believe hot sauce is extra, if I'm not mistaken.  Next comes the fun part:  watching your food be cooked as you wait 10 minutes to pick up your food.  The wait here can be phenomenal, but it is difficult to beat Five Guys and the experience."}
{"text":"The fries here are awesome when they're fresh. There's something about the Five Guys cajun spice that I love! Other than that, the burgers are good when you eat them right away, otherwise they get super wet and sloppy. I only live 10 minutes away from this location but when I get home and open up the foil, my burger is practically dripping and the bread is all wet. Admittedly, I like to load up my burgers with lots of toppings so that's probably why. The free peanuts are good to munch on while waiting for your order."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Five Guys fan, so I was surprised when this brand new location fell so far short of standard expectations. 

About two weeks ago, our party of two ordered two burgers and one order of fries. There were no orders in ahead of ours, but we still waited 15 minutes for our food. It wasn't so late to have closed the kitchen, and a few other patrons were inside eating indicating recent cooking, so I have no clue why there was such a delay with our order. There was no ketchup in the dispensers, which we requested that they refill. Also the dining area could have used a wipe down. When we finally received our food, the fries were over done and the burgers were kind of sad. At least the music kept us in decent spirits!

Perhaps managers are just getting the kinks out of a new operation, but if they continue on as they are, this location will be a detractor to the brand."}
{"text":"I used to like this place, but they must have had some management changes very recently because suddenly the staff seems disjointed, inexperienced and overwhelmed, not to mention all sorts of issues with getting the correct food out in a decent amount of time.  If you go, be ready to wait a long time for the wrong food."}
{"text":"Staff:  Fast and friendly.
Burgers:  Fantastic.
Fries:  Cajun.

I know this is well-known chain, so you expect its food to be good.  Solely based on the setup of the restaurant though and the people working, it kicks ass.  Parking's a little spotty, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Just ordered my food and went to get a drink. Almost all the flavors are out, and the tea machine only spit out straight syrup. I went to tell the girl behind the counter, to see her texting on her phone, with her gloves on and on top of a food prep station. That alone was breaking a lot of health codes. I then try to find a clean table to sit. All of them had food on them and there were only 2 other people inside when we tried to sit down. 
Maybe get off your phone and clean the lobby. 
I hope this burger is worth the money cause this may be my first and last time ever going to a five guys. 

Well tried to eat that abomination of burger. Burned bacon soggy ass bun, couldn't even stay in one piece. I got two bites in and was pissed how expensive it was for a terrible burger. Just tossed it in the trash."}
{"text":"So I spent like, $20 on a meal here and it was just OK.  $20 is sit-in fine dining!  $20 is Mandarin all-u-can-eat buffet on a Friday night! THIS is not a $20 meal.  U think ur burgers/services are wicked cuz u serve free peanuts??  Keep ur chinatown peanuts and I'll keep my cash.  I'd gladly eat a Hero Burger/Big Smoke Burger/The Works etc instead.  Then at least I wouldn't feel like I was dying after; physically AND financially.   Not a fan."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have often been curious about this restaurant, because we usually go to Sweet Tomatoes, which is in the same complex.
I was thoroughly impressed and it was delicious! I ordered a bacon burger with mayo, BBQ sauce, and grilled onions. It was juicy and messy and as close to heaven on earth as you can get in burger form. 
The fries were also delicious-- the server gave us extra just because!
It was a good experience, and now we will have to debate whether to skip Sweet Tomatoes again for a less healthy, but absolutely delicious option."}
{"text":"The crew at this Five Guys is about as entertaining as it gets. Not only do they get your food fast they put on a show as you wait!"}
{"text":"Here we go again. Another overrated burger joint. Five Guys was everything I dislike in a restaurant!!! 

5 Gripes about 5 Guys Burger and Fries: 

1. The lighting- Did you gain inspiration from an operating room? Who wants to eat under a spotlight? Disturbingly too bright! It actually made me uncomfortable. The music was also way too loud to have a conversation. That's when the peanuts came in handy... 

2. The Peanuts- We aren't elephants or at the circus, stadium or bar so I don't get it! Just made me thirsty. 

3. The staff- There were entirely too many employees standing behind the counter goofing off and doing nothing. You would think between the six of them as a team they could have managed to get my order right. FAIL. 

4. The burger-  A backyard BBQ burger at best. Unoriginal. While that's not a bad thing it was just missing the WOW factor for me. It was good, but nothing I can't recreate in the comfort of my own home. 

5. So I lied. I only have 4 gripes about 5 Guys Burgers=) 

Overall there was nothing appealing at all about this place. The combination of the bright lights, loud music and mediocre food was very disappointing. 5 Guys has officially been voted off of my island and out of the circle of trust. Sashay away."}
{"text":"One of my favourite fast food burger joints. Staff here is usually very friendly and also quite quick with the orders even though it can get quite busy here at times. 

I really like the fact that they have the peanuts that you can munch on while you wait for your food to be prepared. There prices are a bit on the expensive side which is why i give it 4 stars but their burgers are really good. 

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Many choices for toppings with a monster serving of fries. 3 of us shared a large order of fries. So delicious and full. If you're in the mood for a delicious, juicy, filling burger, make your way over to five guys. You won't be disappointed. Also, get your full of free peanuts and toss the shells on the floor. Oh and they have the cool new coke soda machines with the billion choices. I love that thing!!!"}
{"text":"A consistent experience and friendly staff make this and nice go to place for lunch when in the area."}
{"text":"I ate too much.  

I feel so gross right now because I ate so much good food.  It was great, I just ate and ate when I should have stopped and surrendered.  

Great place."}
{"text":"Another good place to eat.  I'm sure you have tried it, fries are great.  Burgers are great.  I want to try the shakes.  It's way better Han the cafeteria food at JCU."}
{"text":"It's true that Five Guys serves up a good burger and their fries have a nice flavor, but for me, it doesn't really stand out from the rest of the average fast food burger chains out there. Being in the mall and coined as a \"fast food\" spot, I have been disappointed with their service twice now. The first time, we waited over 20 minutes for our burgers and fries, but I thought it might just be a fluke. Sadly though, last night the same thing happened again. I was surprised that the wait was was so long for such simple food and also since this is a fast food place. The staff was also very rude when we asked about our food after waiting so long. The wait resulted in us being late for the movie. I won't be eager to visit 5 Guys again, unless I have a lot of time. Then again, if I have a lot of time, I won't choose a \"fast food\" spot and instead go to a sit down restaurant. I hope they fix their service and turnaround time."}
{"text":"Employees were friendly and fast. The food was very filling and the peanuts to snack on were good."}
{"text":"OK I know this is a chain and I usually won't review those, but this place makes a fantastic greasy burger. Get the double bacon burger with everything, fries made from real potatoes (soaked with malt vinegar), and call it a blockbuster night, cause you're not going to feel too well after such a decadent act of gluttony."}
{"text":"What can I say about Five Guys that hasn't already been said. They are a quality burger with a massive free toppings list. No doubt about that. Their fries are top notch. Just the right amount of crisp and crunch. To top it all off, they have one of those cool multisoda machines, see what I did there. ;) Not to mention they have pretty much all the self serve peanuts you could ever eat all for a semi reasonable price.

There goes my gripes about the place which is why it was not a perfect match. I do believe their prices are just a tickle overpriced for what they offer but not enough for me to not buy their delicious, mouth watering food. Their quality burger does taste good enough for me to not care about the slight over cost not to mention them having been awarded the best burger in Vegas for multiple years just goes to show that there doesn't need to be a change to an already perfect burger. 

Never before have I had a problem with their food before but this day for some reason after finishing their burger I did feel queasy for a good minute. Enough in fact that I actually went to the restroom just in case I did heave up that deliciousness. Luckily nothing came out and the nausea went away. I came back to finish my fries as though nothing had happened. Again this is not a normal occurrence and every other time the experience has been amazing and I have eating their food without a hitch. There was just something about that day that did not sit right with my stomach.

Regardless, if you are looking for a quality meal, and you are just a little tired from having eaten In-N-Out 6 days in a row and just want a quality burger that doesn't taste like perfection for once, Five Guys is a good runner up that I highly recommend people go there to eat."}
{"text":"Love this 5 guys, always has quick service and great food. Amazing home made fries. Not a place to go if you are allergic to peanuts, they uses peanut oil for their fries as well as they have peanuts out for people to enjoy freely."}
{"text":"First timer and surprised it took me this long to try this place out.  I had heard about it and there were mixed reviews. So thought it best to check it out myself.

At this particular place... First impressions walking in, open and ample sitting area. The red and white colors resembled another well known burger place.  But I reminded myself to stay open minded.  classic rock music playing in the background, which was pretty loud but I did not mind it since I was rocking out all inside. lol  I love the free roasted peanuts while I waited for my order. 

I ordered my burger truly the way I wanted it, single patty with grilled onions, mushrooms, lettuce, and mayo.  All the toppings are free and there were plenty of choices.  I ordered my drink and tried the cajun fries.  My burger was pretty good. Meat patty was juicy full if flavor and I really liked the tasty burger bun.  The Cajun fries were pretty darn good with a nice kick but not freak'in spicy. 

Clean place. The staff was super friendly and checked on customers at the tables even though the staff do not wait on tables. 

Definitely will return and look forward to creating a masterpiece burger for myself!!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to take the time to write a positive review for such a great team at the Scottsdale food court location. Juan is definitely a great leader and his attention to detail shows. He sets a great example for the rest of the team and all of their positive energy and attitudes spread to everyone who visits! I've been here multiple times and it's always a wonderful experience. I want to say thank you and keep doing a fantastic job!"}
{"text":"The best thing about Five Guys is their fries. They are great and plentiful. Burgers are OK. I think there are juicy options out there at the same price point."}
{"text":"Needed a fairly quick lunch today and 5 Guys was the answer. At 1130 a.m. we were the only customers present. We each had a small burger dressed differently and shared fries. Everything was pretty good, fries were a bit well done, but no biggie. Drinks at $2.19 seems a little pricey, small fries at $2.99 may seem high, but you get a ton of fries that are hard to finish.

Now trying to evaluate 5 Guys vs. BT Burger; a dollar or two difference;  I will pay closer attention next time to the subtle differences."}
{"text":"Stop in here for lunch and got a burger and fries... after sitting down and opening up the Fry's I noticed they were incredibly saturated and Soggy and whenever you grab one they kind of broke in half from the oil saturation. I I brought the order of fries back to the counter where a husky gentleman looked at it and then decided to remake the order for me. During the course of him dropping the fries and waiting on him to get done he proceeded to touch his bottom as well as his perineal area, go Google it lol and picked up a towel that was lying on the floor beside the fry station and proceeded to wipe off the salt and grease from the counter and brushing loose Fry's back into the fry pit, disgusting. I called him over and asked him why he was doing that and he said that he had changed the gloves in the back of the store LOL. The shift manager Lauren was there I told her what the guy was doing and she put him in the back on potato peeling Duty I'm assuming and she continued with making the fries without touching her butt or perineal area so that was a win. Surprising cuz usually five guys have really good crews at their locations so this one's slipping a bit."}
{"text":"Lots of hype for a burger smashed into its foil wrapper and drowned in ketchup & mustard. Fries are soggy and flavorless. Staff was very nice, however."}
{"text":"I hate to write this review but I must. I went here on my lunch break and was prepared to eat an amazing burger...but what I got was unfortunately the WORST burger I have ever had :-( 

I ordered the cheese burger with grilled onion,  mushroom, jalape√±o and mustard, and you'd think with all of those flavorful  veggies the burger would have some flavor. ..sadly it was just as bland and soggy as the Cajun fries. 

The best thing about this 5 Guys was the customer service...it would be a 5 if I were rating it. I'm pretty sure I won't be back here, although I'll be reminiscent of it since that grease smell is on my clothes. I'm coming back home Smashburger :-)"}
{"text":"Je suis tellement d√©√ßue par Five Guys ! J'en ai entendu que du bien que ce soit sur Yelp ou m√™me sur Youtube (taper Dayum dans la barre de recherche) et r√©sultat mes attentes √©taient beaucoup trop grandes.
Situ√© en plein centre, pr√®s du centre commercial Eaton, Five Guys a l'avantage d'√™tre pr√®s de tout et je l'ai trouve super propre ! 
J'ai toujours ete curieuse sur le fait que les burgers soient enveloppes dans de l'aluminium mais apparement c'est juste pour garder la chaleur, ce aui est pratique mais j'aurai prefere quelque chose de plus naturel, du moins quant a l'apparence.
Pendant l'attente des peanuts/cacahuetes sont a disposition. Un ami me conseille d'aller voir au comptoir ou l'on voit directement la preparation de nos commandes. Les frites sont renverses sauvagement dans le sachet en papier (fait expres) et du coup on voit tout le gras que les frites contiennent. Sac plastique a prevoir si vous voulez pas salir toutes vos affaires.
Je n'ai pas beaucoup aime les frites, la peau y est laissee mais c'est une affaire de gout.
J'ai choisi de prendre un cheeseburger et j'ai eu la surprise d'y trouver 2 steaks (je voulais juste le fromage en plus d'un burger simple).
Le bun est tout mou et devient vite pateux en bouche, la garniture est bonne sans plus.

Je trouve que c'est assez cher pour ce que c'est mais c'est a essayer au moins une fois."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff here!

I had never heard of 5 guys and we stopped in to see what it was about...

The food was good and it is decorated with potato bags and other restaurant supplies which actually looks pretty cool. 

The service was good...

I just wish he ketchup didn't have high fructose corn syrup in it... I didn't fault them starts over this though as it is unfortunately common in the US....."}
{"text":"Great burgers with fresh toppings. Cajun fries are my favorite. I love the little bits of skin left on them."}
{"text":"Went here during prime lunch time. It's a decent burger but not worth the price paid for. (30$ for large fries, one regular burger one large and one drink) Probably because they were rushing to make so many orders... Cajun fries were good though!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this chain for a long time and this was my first try. I really wanted to like it but I don't. The place was clean and service was friendly and fine. I just didn't like the food or the vibe. I ordered a burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, ketchup and mustard plus a side of fries and a drink. I ordered it to eat in. The wait was not long at all. My food came in a bag. I said I wanted it to eat in and I guess the bag is how it's served. I open the bag and the sandwich is underneath a pile of fries with a cup for the fries next to the sandwich in the bottom of the bag. It's a generous order of fries, but an annoying delivery method. The menu states they serve the burgers well done and juicy. They are well done. They are not juicy. The burger had a poor crumbly bun and all I could taste was the pickles, tomatoes, condiments etc. The skinny well done patty was overwhelmed by the toppings. The fries were cut to perfect dimensions and cooked nicely but horribly under salted. The burger was nothing I would ever return for. A little about the ambience. The kitchen has this loud interaction with the customer thing going on that I find very annoying. When you enter they yell something like \"man in the door\" and they yell what they are cooking back and forth to each other. Makes me feel like I'm eating in a pet store specializing in parrots. It was slow when I was there, only a few tables. I'd hate to hear that on a busy day. While I was eating one of the employees in the kitchen asked me, from the kitchen while I was seated, how the burger was. I shrugged and grimaced. She asked if there was a problem and if I needed more fries. I just said all I tasted was the veggies, that I just didn't care for it. I appreciate that they cared to ask but I think the correction would be a total revamp of their setup."}
{"text":"Disappointing that burgers are not made from quality organic beef or at least grass fed beef or bison. If Costco can source enough organic beef and grass fed bison then the question remains. Why not put their best product on the grill. Why not go Gmo free."}
{"text":"This is a no-nonsense place to gorge and revel in good ol' American gluttony!  Guys at work heard about this place so we went for lunch.  Ended up needing to snake the coratid artery on the drive back!

Menu?  Simple, burgers... fries.... want cheese & bacon with that?

Burgers?  Large, delicious, and with lots of toppings to choose from (including stuff like jalapenos and BBQ sauce!)  Throw in some healthy lettuce to feel good about yourself!

Fries?  Geez, enough fries?!  You'll get a paper sack of fresh-cut heart-clogging goodness.  Yeah, a brown paper sack... full!

Go back?  Absolutely... after the bypass surgery (luckily, the hospital is conveniently nearby)!  Die happy, right??

P.S. Don't look at the nuitrition guide if you don't want to know about \"62 grams of fat\".  *G*"}
{"text":"Typical low-quality Steelyard fare.  We got a large fry, a little cheeseburger, and a regular cheeseburger.  Apparently Steelyard has cajun fries, because they were mixed in with our regular fries, which were clearly old and not made fresh as I would expect from Five Guys, which is expensive in terms of fast-casual food.  

My burger was made up of not an actual burger patty, but burned pieces of ground beef.  I called the manager and he said, \"Do you want to come and get another order?\"  No apology.  Sure, let me come out in the freezing cold and get another order.  No thanks.  I should've known, as everything in Steelyard is a huge let down.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"In a world of fast-food burgers, for me, success trends toward simple.  Similar to In & Out, Five Guys has a mid-century, nostalgic feel.  It does not offer an expansive menu and there are no \"secret\" spreads like on In & Out burgers.  Instead, the Five Guys cheeseburger is probably best described as a backyard cheeseburger.  But sometimes, you don't want all the frills--you just want a good, basic burger."}
{"text":"Five Guys is delicious. Only complaint is I think it's a little misleading that the regular cheeseburger is actually a double. Every time I go there it's really good and prepared to order. A \"little cheeseburger\" is a single patty and a little fry is plenty for one. They are pretty high priced for a burger place but you get what you pay for. I like getting the Cajun fries (but I always forget to order). A regular order of fries is plenty to share for two! I'm sure I'll be back. Do not go anywhere near this place if your trying to diet!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but we don't see what all the hype is about! We've gone twice now & the burgers seem similar to Carl's Jr. Okay I admit, the fries ARE great & they give you a LOT, but I sill LOVE IN-N-OUT's Double-Double faaaar more!  Five Guys doesn't even have shakes! IN-N-OUT's shakes ROCK, as they use real ice cream & they're thick! ...They are also pricy, too!  ...A double cheese burger & a reg order of fries was over $9! We will most likely not return to Five Guys....IN-N-OUT...here we come!  :)"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious and fresh hamburgers and french fries. The employees are always nice and friendly and the place is clean. However I would recommend to eat in only because once we ordered to go and by the time we got our burgers home the buns were mushy from the heat of them being wrapped in aluminum foil making them inedible  (which has happened to me at other local burger joints, perhaps a paper wrap would work better like the fast food places use)."}
{"text":"I've been dying to go to this place!  As a first-timer, I was definitely not disappointed!!  I do have to admit that I'm a burger fanatic and haven't come across too many burgers I wasn't at least mildly enthusiastic about, but despite that, I do think there's something special about Five Guys.

It wasn't busy at all when we got there, which surprised me a little since I've heard this place being compared to In N Out so often (and In N Out is ALWAYS a zoo!), but then again, it was almost closing time.  It took a few seconds to acquaint myself with the menu, but once I took a look at all the toppings available, I was pretty darn excited!  Grilled onions AND mushrooms?!  Yes, please!

I had the hamburger and sinfully opted not to get fries (this is pretty much an anomaly in my world, but I was feeling a little off that day), so sadly, I can't comment on their probable deliciousness.  I'm pretty sure I'd be more than ok with just one patty, but it comes with two.  Every single bite of it was fresh and oh so very yummy.

While I do understand the general public's constant comparison of Five Guys to In N Out, I choose to stray from adding to the rivalry.  The only thing I found similar between the two is the interior decor looked a bit familiar..red and white tile and what not.  And yes, they're both atypical burger joints with a simplistic menu...(Oh good gosh...look at me!!  I AM comparing them!  LOL), but, to me, they each stand tall in their own right.  Their price points aren't the same...my Five Guys burger was in the $5 range, while I usually spend $2 for an In N Out burger...a Double Double (since we're talking two patties at Five Guys) $3-4...I guess I'm playing both sides of the burger fence here, but being a California girl raised on those little red In N Out palm trees, I didn't feel like I was cheating on them with Five Guys.  I have a new friend in Five Guys and still maintain my loyalty to In N Out...it's like dual citizenship...

And an afterthought...I'm very easily amused so that Super-duper soda machine totally made my night!"}
{"text":"We love to eat here, but today(around 5:30pm) we noticed the worker who was frying the fries, was eating them straight off the fryer. He was wearing gloves, but that didn't stop him from sticking his fingers in his mouth along with the fries he was sneaking to eat. We were a little grossed out and felt it was unprofessional. This made us not want to come back to this location in the future."}
{"text":"I pass by this place on a fairly regular basis but never dropped in until now.

The place was fairly busy when we got there but the line moved fairly quickly. The menu also offered hot dogs and sandwiches but I was here to try the burger. There were 4 burgers to choose from as well as a little version of each. The difference between the regular and little version is that the little comes with one patty while the regular has two.

You also get to choose the toppings and sauce for your burger from a fairly decent list of items. 

I ended up having the bacon cheeseburger and I must say it was pretty good. The patty was juicy and when combined with the toppings and melted cheese looked so unhealthy but was so good although I wished they had put more sauce.

I'd recommend dropping by and grabbing a bite although I did find it a tad pricey for what you get. Also don't forget to grab some peanuts to snack on."}
{"text":"A overall disappointment! I always enjoy going to a place where they give out free peanuts, but normally the fun is throwing the shells all over. Here they give you the peanuts, and no real place to put the shells. Apparently, the floor is not expectable here. Also, the \"build your own burger\" theme is not original at all! In fact go to McDonald's and ask them to add or take off any topping to any burger and they will.....way to go you \"built your own burger.\" I just saying that this can be done ANYWHERE.

Then I ordered the bacon burger with grilled onions. I ended up with no bacon and for some reason mushrooms. Once I advised them of the problem they were kind enough to give me some bacon that looked like it was cooked yesterday. The bacon was cold, old, dry, and all broken up. At that point I felt like they might as well just have given me bacon bits from a jar. 

If I or anyone else is going to pay $11 for a drink, burger, and no fires, they should at least get the order right."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys. But! 
This location has to be one of the best. Always clean and always a warm welcome. But it now costs over $15 for a Bacon Cheese Burger with a small fry and drink. Great Burger. Small fries are huge for one, most of the time. But it's not really $15 food. You can get a steak dinner for around the same. Not a good steak. I just can't justify the price."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time.  The best burgers in calgary.  The only thing is the bacon is done at 11am, so you have to get there early for fresh cooked bacon/onions/mushrooms.   Everything from the temp of the burger patties raw or cooked is checked and methodically done like a well lubricated machine.  The staff always say hello/goodbye and are friendly and great to talk to.   The peanuts are a nice starter, and they are free of course, because they're just peanuts.  Its only peanuts.  The real money is in the burger.

This is what perfection looks like.  A chain dedicated to one thing - BURGER.  Do it, and do it right, and you can do it well and be a millionare in the process.

The cost?  Its peanuts, compared to the burger."}
{"text":"Went to the five guys for lunch with coworkers. Line up was long as expected since it was lunch hour. However the wait time was fairly quick and the restaurant had ample seats for everyone.

Got the cheeseburger with mayo, ketchup, lettuce, tomato, grilled mushrooms, jalape√±o peppers. It was not messy despite the amount of toppings and it tasted juicy. Not much more to say about a good burger. 


For fries, they come in either the five guys flavour or Cajun flavour. They give a ridiculous amount of fries so I would not tackle them alone if you go.


Oh and peanuts are free."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Five Guys in Peoria. I'm a giant fan of their veggie sandwich while my friends love the burgers so it's a definite win win when we go in. I'm also a super french fry fanatic and grab the cajun fries here any chance I get. Service is typically good and the food is pushed out quickly which I really appreciate. Stop in if you're in the mood for a burger and some great fries."}
{"text":"HAIR IN BOTH MY BURGERS! I was half way through my burger and found a hair. Of course before flipping out I thought maybe it was mine. BUT NO I pulled out a long ass piece of hair right out of the patty so much so a piece of the burger was still on the strand of hair. Then as my friend eats their burger there's hair all over their tomatoes! 
Unfortunately I'm too far now to turn around to inform them so yelp will have to do."}
{"text":"Been to FG a few times, first time at this location. Had a great experience. The right order, clean and not a long wait. As usual, the burgers and fries were fabulous. Might have helped - given some of the other reviews I've read - that we went there when it wasn't busy, but all was good. In general, they are a good solid step up from In-N-Out , which I also love. These two chains (and Shake Shack) destroy all the typical fast-food burger places like Macs, BK, Wendy's, Sonic, etc., etc."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. A little bit in the expensive side. Very loud and cold...  Could turn up the heat a bit !"}
{"text":"By far the best burger you can get in a fast food setting. And the fries are killer. Seriously no fast food burger compares. Don't expect cheap though, a good sized burger with a small order of fries is plenty of food but it'll cost you $10 or more. 
To In and Out fans, the burgers are better, with more options and there's NO COMPARISON as far as the fries go. In and Out fries are terrible.

Smashburger is the closest comparison, with nicer dining rooms and great burgers (plus beer) but, again, the fries are strings of cardboard. Their soft drink options also suck by comparison. 

I only wish they had a drive-thru, but it wouldn't work since they grill them fresh and there are tons of topping options.

If you see a Five Guys, stop and get one. The Scottsdale location at Greenway is convenient, clean and awesome."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of burgers, so I really wanted to like this place. I've been there at least 4-5 times now since they opened and more recently just last week. The location is great, ample parking, clean, spacious etc. I'm just not a fan of their burgers. I've tried the little burgers & the double burgers. Neither for me had much taste and I found that the super thin burger & bun were falling apart easily. The fries are pretty good if they're not over fried - by over fried i mean a bit on the dark side where they have a slightly bitter taste and have no flavour except for the peanut oil. I can't take my kids in there because they use peanut oil - which is another negative for me. Also, I don't like the taste of my fries in peanut oil, yes you can actually taste the peanut in the oil. I also can't believe they don't even have gravy for their fresh cut fries!! I got a chuckle when I asked if they had gravy followed by \"everybody is always asking for gravy!\". 2 burgers, 2 drinks and a large fries set us back almost $40. Really not worth it in my opinion. I think I'll stick to the Burger's Priest - just too bad they won't be opening a Markham location anytime soon. Also, if your kid has a tree nut or peanut allergy - stay clear of this place. Not only do they use peanut oil but also have boxes of peanuts open for customers to help themselves to. Which would mean that if tables aren't properly wiped down - that could be serious trouble for anyone with a peanut/nut allergy."}
{"text":"Glad they finally opened a location near my house.  Between them and Chili's, I can't decide who has the best chain burgers (in this town).  They are hands down better than In-N-Out.  First of all, the staff is very friendly.  I love the fact that their burgers come plain and you tell them what you want on it.  It makes things a lot easier.  Their fries are fresh and cooked perfectly.  And the burgers are prepared wonderfully too.  The cheese is always melted.  And the burgers and fries both taste great.  Now the couple of issues... the price is rather high.  It was almost $14 for a Cheeseburger, Medium Fries, and a regular drink.  I hate the Cocacola Freestyle machines.  They are neat looking and it's a good concept, but the drinks just don't taste right.  They also taste of multiple flavors, because I'm sure the jets are the same that they all come out of. Too many places are going to this, and it's disappointing.  And when I got there, the dining room was a bit of a mess.  Floor needed sweeping and several dirty tables, but they started cleaning as soon as I sat down.  It is a great burger and fries though.  Just can't eat there too often, because of the price."}
{"text":"Family of 5, two adults and three kids (ages 12,10 and 3). Two kids got hot dogs, my 3 year old had to eat an adult size cheeseburger because they don't offer a kids menu, wife and I both got a normal burger, the whole family split one medium order of fries and all had water to drink. Anywhere else that would run $20-25 tops. How much at 5 Guys? $40.03!!! Seriously, the food is okay, not worth these ridiculous prices. Will never come here again, I just got gouged like a mofo!!!"}
{"text":"Always have had great burgers. Fresh veggies, great beef, fresh tasty fries. They have a courteous staff. I love this place"}
{"text":"I was the only customer in the restaurant and they could not even get my order correct.  The ham burger has 2 patties and they only were grilling one.  15.39 for two sandwiches and a drink.  Going to go to red robin next time, better value android take the same amount of time to cook."}
{"text":"Pure and simple. Burgers, fries, hot dogs, and peanuts to nosh on. 

It's great food, simple. How can you possibly go wrong?  
Pro tip: get your burger all the way. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love this place. The cajun fries are the best, and the so called little burger is pretty damn good too. The portions are massive. There's NOTHING little about the little burger, and the regular frie is enough for two. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the price.  It's a little on the high side."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite fast-food burgers with a ton of options.  My problem is, everytime I eat here, I end up spending $10 on a burger.  I do enjoy the burger, and granted I do order it \"Grilled Cheese\" style and get 2 patties, but $10 for a fast-food burger is a little much.  I'm afraid I will keep going anyway when I get the urge.  BTW, if you do go here, and you like grilled cheese; do yourself a favor and order the Grilled Cheeseburger.  It's not on the menu, but they will know exactly what you want and probably comment that it is the Best way to order their burgers!"}
{"text":"I myself LOVE five guys, i always get the double cheeseburger (i havent been there in a while so im not sure if thats what its called)....it will fill you to the gills,not to mention that their hotdogs are expecially good as well,also the free peanuts are a plus plus plus......but if it is one thing that gets me is that the food is insanely priced...i mean don't get me wrong,the taste is original...you just may never have another burger like it....but seems like everytime Me and my wife step in the door we walk away atleast $20 shorter!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a burger joint guys....let's bring it down to burger joint prices please!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"5 Stars?  Seriously?  Must be their own staff.  Soggy tasteless bun. Meat okay. If you ask light on the condiments they still put so much on it spills over all over the place.  Fries are under fried.  Positive is the Fountain pop is good.   Otherwise, this place wouldn't make it in the Top 100 burger list."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Five Guys and their fresh cut cajun spiced fries. Cooked to order, not in a warmer. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time at this location, and ever in this chain. Very surprised, very pleased! Fresh, clean, great tasting food. A little pricey, but worth it.  Love the build it yourself style of burger joint idea."}

Rumor has it, we have one coming to Hawaii in the near future . . . probably be Maui - they get all the good stuff over there!"}
{"text":"This place I feel is over rated. They have huge burgers at a fair price, but their meat has no flavor. I have given this place three chances and have yet to walk away feeling fullfilled and not nauseous.  Way too much grease and not enough flavor. Their fries are often soggy. Not impressed."}
{"text":"A fine fast food burger joint.

I always have trouble reaching the word limit for these ordinary, fast food resteraunts. like all Tim Hortons McDonald's Wendy's Starbucks, Five Guys is a option but nothing special besides the fact that it's a successful franchise."}
{"text":"Really good food. Outstanding customer service. I would much rather spend a few extra bucks for good food and awesome customer service. Every time I come here everyone is always friendly and prompt with service. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Use the app and place your order before you arrive. Works great."}
{"text":"First time eating there last week, was a littled worried because a few other reviews said music too loud... I thought atmosphere was mellow, music consistent level for a burger joint and not offensive. The burgers are thinner than your typical burger but I think that's what makes them delicious! No bloating heavy feeling after. The cashier suggested we get just 1 fry instead of the 3 we planned which was wonderful! Fries are huge! An employee sweeping floors went out of way to bring me a highchair which was very appreciated and surprising. Food all freshly made and can see employees preparing it. Will be back to try milkshakes for sure. Thank you for a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced. 
For the price I highly recommend going to Ferren's and supporting a local owner."}
{"text":"Five Guy's has one delicious burger. 

A friend brought me to Five Guys after a day of boating at the lake. The nice juicy burger hit the spot. It was so delicious I went back the next day for more. 

It's a good thing i'm not allergic to peanuts because I enjoyed the side peanuts. Since it was my first time we opted for the little burger (all the way), Cajun fries, and a drink. By the time I had gotten to the burger I was stuffed from the drink, peanuts, and fries. Next time I'll probably opt out on the fries. The burger reminded me of an 'In n Out' burger on steroids. Now that i've had a taste of Five Guys I won't ever be going back to In n Out. 

Those peanuts do make for a messy floor but the staff is always on point with keeping the place clean. 

On a side note I love places that have the Coke soda machines with hundreds of different flavor options. My personal favorite is the Diet Vanilla Coke. 

My rating 4 stars only because my friend ordered the Cheeseburger (2 patty's) with mayo and ketchup only. and for $6.00. If you added the toppings I would see it being worth it."}
{"text":"Clean. Not fast food but good and EFFICIENT. Super friendly staff makes it seem like you already know everyone that works there. 

Delicious and well prepared - LIke they actually care about the product they're serving you. 

I'll say clean again because not only is the inside spotless but they actually care about the outside of their store also! Very pleasant to walk into. Good music and at a nice volume where you can still talk with someone.  

Really a great choice if you're feeling a burger and definitely the go to spot in this area."}
{"text":"Why do you have to be so tasty?! This place definitely lives up to the hype! Not only are the burgers huge, they're absolutely delicious. I ordered a cheeseburger with everything and my sister ordered a bacon cheeseburger, and we shared an regular order of fries... in hindsight, we should have gotten a size smaller- it was just so much food! We were quite surprised when we got back to our hotel and unpacked everything at the amount of food in the bag. Everything was fresh and hot and the service was excellent and quite quick. We found the fries a little on the salty side, but delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"If your into burgers, 5 guys is def worth checking out.

I probably drove by this place a million times but finally decided to check it out after a movie night at Town Square. Walking in, I noticed two things: this place is WHITE, and there are peanuts everywhere. The whole place looks like it was bleached up and down. The floors, walls, everything is white. It has a nice clean look, and there are giant bags of peanuts all over the place.

The menu itself isn't very large but it does offer vegetarian and chicken options if your not feeling beef. The burgers are highly customizable with tons of condiments and add ons. I did notice that the bacon is a very crispy. I am not sure what they do to it but thank god its not soggy. On top of that they give you a ton of fries, and i mean a ton. A small order could easily feed 3 people. However, I think their fries are way too soggy, I mean I am happy they are fresh and all but really, they are soggy and oily which is one of the reasons they don't get a full 5 stars.

 However, the thing i gets me excited is their soda machine. This thing is huge, has a touchscreen, and dispenses all different kinds of sodas mmmmm. They probably have syrup packs and all but still, mango flavored fresca is awesome! I am sure that if you have been to one 5 guys you have been to them all, but I think this place is def worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Man I don't know... I think this is probably the best hamburger I have had in a while! Cool atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite burger joints. You can watch as they freshly make your burger in fries right in front of you. If you want a burger that's full of flavor and not dripping with grease, this place is it. Fries are great too. I love when they put what farm the potatoes came from. Today they came from Pasco, WA!"}
{"text":"I had a hankering for a better burger than typical fast food, and Five Guys was in the neighborhood and worthy of a first time check out.

And it is, if you haven't been before.  

But despite the rave restaurant reviews utterly plastered on almost every open space on the wall, this place is totally overrated.    

The burger wasn't bad.  I dig all the fix-ins you can put on them, but it makes for a pretty messy eating experience.  

Unfortunately, the burgers are way overpriced for what they really are--as another reviewer put it it, it really is a step up from Carl's Jr.    I ordered what should have been a \"pretty big\" burger and it said I got two patties on the receipt, but in retrospect I think I got shorted cause the second one was much bigger.   

Whatever the case, after two $6 burgers, I was still hungry.   That shouldn't happen in fast food places like this.  In-N-Out is twice the good deal this place is.    

I did not try the fries... I thought I ordered them, but in fact did not because I didn't shout that I wanted fries.  Five Guys is annoyingly loud.   Some day I will understand the onslaught of overplayed classic rock played in practically every eating establishment these days.  It's getting annoying, especially when it causes order fuckups. 

The service was quick and really friendly.   And I like the free peanuts.   It makes me think my two-star rating is a little low, but the soda machine tasted like soap and some bedraggled man took his sweet time in the *one* bathroom they had available.    

And ultimately, it is an expensive burger that would have been forgettable if I didn't have a particular fondness for A-1 sauce and 'shrooms.

I could only see myself going again if I were stuck on the corner, needed to eat quick, already ate at Chipotle's, and had some money to burn, all of which are a stretch for me, but probably not  the upper middle-classed downtown lunch crowd.   

And that lunch crowd must be exactly this place's target market--with all of the above being said, you're probably not going to find a better, quicker burger within a short walk from the Washington St office towers.  The plethora of fast convenience stores on the ground floor of Block 77, brought to us by CityScape's cynical over-commercialism, is not without its utility to some people.  

For anybody else, I wouldn't bother a second time.  

3/10."}
{"text":"Looking for a good burger without the frills? Five Guys is your spot.

You cant really go wrong with your order here, it's a classic burger spot with classic burger toppings. I got the bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, jalape√±os, saut√©ed mushrooms and onions, ketchup and mustard. I had no complaints. The cheese was melty and the patties were meaty. 

I paired my burger with a side of fries and a cherry milkshake. The milkshake was thick and creamy. My only negative comment here was you can tell it's made with cherry syrup because it was so sweet. But if you like sweet then the milkshakes are a perfect choice. 

It's also good to note that this burger joint has FREE PEANUTS, not to be confused with PEANUT FREE."}
{"text":"This place is great! You must try the cajun fries with your burger! I like the atmosphere is also for clean and simple. Burgers here are very delicious!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, yes please! I always get a Jr. Because I plan to keep eating red meat till I die, and I don't feel like over testing my cholesterol medicine. Or maybe it's because I know I'm also getting a Peanut Butter Milkshake with Oreo Creme so I need to 'save the calories!' I finally got my wife to try this amazingness of a milk shake (yesterday after going here) and she immediately said, that's amazing! And Deadly....  

my only suggestion to the 5 Food Buyers would be, buy fresh mushrooms please"}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad.  As other's have suggested elsewhere, don't over do it on the condiments and you'll be fine.  The patties are hand form and this alone makes them better than any fast food joint where the patties are pre-formed.

Five Guys is one step up from regular fast food burger places.  You won't find a drive through here and your burger is made when you order it.  A regular Hamburger will come with two patties so if you're really wanting just one, you'll want to order the Little Hamburger.

This place is located across the parking lot from the Outlet Mall, so do some shopping/walking and then do some eating, or the other way around.  Either way, take in some calories and burn some calories.  When you walk in the door, you will probably be greeted with some form of welcome.  Note the bags of potatoes on the floor that tell you what kind of fries you'll be having today.  Oh, and you will be having fries, right?  Live like me and go for the Cajun fries.  Mmmm.

Walk up to the counter and place your order.  They have a long list of toppings to choose from but don't get carried away.  After placing your order, have a seat.  It will take a few minutes.  Bring your phone so you can spend time Yelping or playing games.  

Oh yeah, almost forgot.  While you're waiting, they have a treat for you.  Shelled peanuts.  Just go on up to the barrel and take a paper bowl and fill it to your heart's content.  Head to your seat and eat away.  Remove shell first.

Your burger's gonna come wrapped in a soft foil.  The buns are really soft and end up getting mashed a bit, but it's still good this way.  This tends to be a sloppy burger as it's being eaten, so keep it partially wrapped as you go.

And one order of fries is enough for a couple of people (you get a bunch).

They do a nice job of keeping the place clean even when it's busy."}
{"text":"It been awhile since I walked down Yonge and Five Guys caught my eye... mostly because their decor was a little like In-n-Out in California. Curious, I walked in and decided to give their burger a try.

I ordered a little burger, I liked their wide selection of free toppings including grilled onions and mushrooms. I just ordered the onions with a few other condiments but it's nice to know the mushroom option is there. 

The burgers are all done well done, which gives them a crispy exterior which I like but it wasn't dry which is often the case with well done burgers. And wet, \"juicy\" burgers are over rated I think, mostly because they're messy and make the bun soggy. And unless the burger place is using premium beef and is put on a plate to be consumed immediately, I'd rather they cook it through. The crisp exterior compliments condiments better and has a lot more flavour. Think fast-food burger, not gourmet burger and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

I didn't like that they didn't offer combos tho, and that their smallest order of fries was massive and $4. Seeing as this is a pop in when I'm hungry and in a rush type place rather than a night out type place, it'd be nice to have a smaller option if I wanted to grab and go.

Also the service was a bit slow and unhelpful. There was no one behind me in line and when I asked what the difference between a little burger and a regular burger was the lady at the counter seemed a bit annoyed. I'm sure she gets asked that question a lot but don't blame the customer if your menu is unclear. And I waited a bit longer than you would expect for burgers made on an assembly line.

But all in all, my first experience was good and I always weigh food much higher than anything else on my reviews so 4 stars it is! 

I'll probably go back and try a few other items on the menu and update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"The best burger I've had in ages.  Love it with the grilled jalape√±os.  The service was excellent.  Very friendly.  Came by the table several times to see if we needed any thing.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The cashier was very friendly and attentive. That's the feedback for the one star. The burger was one of the worst I've had in a long time. The bun was mush and fully soacked. The bun ripped apart as soon as I lifted the burger. The  meat was dry and pretty much absent of any seasonings. The fries were greasy, soft and extremely salty. And why do they offer old salty peanuts. no wonder they are for free. This was my second visit after one year. The last time was a little better and I thought it might have been an exception the last time. But seems like they are very consistent with the quality of their product. This was my last burger in this place. It's a low quality product for a premium fast food price."}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburgh for an academic tournament at Carnegie Mellon and decided to stop at this 5 Guys for our lunch break. I have to say, one of the best 5 Guys I've ever ate at. Super quick, excellent service, and the quality of the food was top notch. If you're in the Oakland area of the Burgh and need a quick place to eat at a low price and great quality.. keep this in mind."}
{"text":"Rather have these burgers than McDonald's anyday! The burgers are always fresh, great tasting and they are made relatively fast. I rather wait alittle more to get fresh food. Came here on a Saturday evening, no wait no line! Lobby was clean and always had an employee walking around cleaning up. I ordered the double cheeseburger with bacon and mushrooms! Also a side of fries and wow!the portion of fries is always hefty! Unfortunately I did not have any room left for a milkshake :0("}
{"text":"As far as basic burgers go this is an OK option. The flavor is ok and basic toppings give everyone enough choice. Better than McDonald's yeah and similar to In-n-Out but nothing really special. Price is not cheap for a burger so I would expect a little more, but not more fries because they give you a bucket full and more."}
{"text":"Best Five Guys ever. Food delicious as usual and the employees are super nice! Seriously this location has the nicest employees of any Five Guys I've been too."}
{"text":"Ok help me out here, there so much hype about this place , I don't get it. there are signs everywhere inside  Five Guys about how they have the best this and the best that. So after having tried Five Guys at least five times at three different locations, I pretty much convinced that the hype surrounding the food is just that. I tried hard to like them, but what a let-down for me, Seriously I was hoping they would be similar to In-N-Out burger since we don't have any around here. Sorry, not even close. The burgers are okay  nothing special, the fries are ok, better with the Cajun seasoning.  But a ok Buger with Fries and Drink at around $11 is a bit much for this food joint.  I can go to a restaurant like Outback, Chili's, or Red Robin and get a better burger and fries for less."}
{"text":"I'm normally not opposed to greasy food, but I didn't like that my burger bun was soaked. Don't get me wrong, the beef and the fries were excellent.

Service was quick, staff was friendly, and their soda machine is AWESOME. Anyway, I would certainly not mind trying this place again."}
{"text":"Five Guys was a staple in college. The burgers could just be absolutely loaded up with ingredients, the fries would feed you for days. And the best part was, you could get an awesome burger for not a lot of money. 

However, somewhere along the way it became ok to just raise prices and think the public isn't going to get it? I can go to a restaurant and get a burger and fries to go for equal to or even less than what I'd pay at 5 guys now. It used to be $5 and change for a nice decent burger, now it's basically $7 plus $4 for fries, don't forget the drink. Before you know it you're at $13-$14 for just a fast casual dining experience.

Do you know what I can get for $14? Two orders of Chipotle for myself and fianc√©. Think about that!

I do love the taste of 5 guys, but somewhere along the way you guys forgot your value proposition."}
{"text":"3 separate times we were asked how our meal was. I am simply blown away by the service at this 5 Guys! 

Same great burger taste you'd expect from 5 Guys, topped with delicious service -- WIN. 

Keep on keeping on, Las Vegas. You win."}
{"text":"Ok so it's definately more expensive then a standard fast food burger place but the burgers are hella good in this nice greasy way, they aren't these frozen pattys like most fast food places, look pretty darn fresh to me, and cooking the fries in peanut oil gives them what seems to be less a heavy feeling in my tummy after i've eaten like a TON of them, definately somthing to try once if you havent gone yet."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries in this fast food joint! One good thing to note is that the regular burger is actually a double, and the junior is a single. Burgers are juicy and big, and fries are seasoned well. Add any available toppings for free! I like the usuals (lettuce, tomato, onions, mustard, mayo, ketchup), but I also add grilled mushrooms and A1 sauce. Delicious! Self-serve peanuts are all-you-can-eat. 

My organization is based in Madison, and every time I'm in town, I need to grab a burger from Five Guys. Sadly, my home town and state don't have a Five Guys...yet!"}
{"text":"Good milk shake and fries!! Cheese burger was good. Very disappointed they gave me canned mushrooms even I ordered grilled."}
{"text":"I hardly ever add salt to my food but i had to add salt to my bacon cheeseburger! NEED I SAY MORE?"}
{"text":"We came in 5 mins before closing on 5/29 at the store near UNLV and the cheerful manager (who called me, 'boss', which was cool) apologized that the shake machine was already cleaned/shut down but said they would make whatever we wanted. Our burgers and gourmet hot dog were fantastic and he gave us an extra pile of fresh made Cajun fries to make up for the lack of milkshakes.  My daughter also spilled a large drink on the floor and as we were sopping it with napkins the manager came out and said they would be mopping up and told us not to worry about it. He put up a caution cone even though there were only 5 customers, which I also appreciated. Great experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Love their online ordering app! So easy to use, order exactly what you want and pay for it with a card. By the time you walk to your car and drive there, your order is ready for you. Just go to the pick-up counter and tell them your name. I love their hot dogs way more than their burgers and I would give them 4 stars but their customer service is a bit lacking.

Every time I go to pick up my online order, I'm standing at the pick up counter for minutes before somebody acknowledges me. They all face the counter when they're working so its like they all pretend i'm not there. The other day, I had to finally tell the fry girl to hand me my order after standing there for about five minutes. She apologized and said \"oh, I didn't know you were waiting for that.\" I just walked away and smiled but wanted to say, \"well, you could've just simply asked if I needed help.\" but whatevs. Not all burger places have the same level of service that INO has so I should just get over it."}
{"text":"Awesome burger, below average fries and a long ass wait. Would be 4 stars except they are like twice as much as In n Out, which I think is the only competition they have!

Plus, this is Vegas baby...you need a drive thru and have to be open later than 10 PM!"}
{"text":"Wow so today I informed the cashier about the last mishap
And
She was actually the General Manager for the store
She seemed truly concerned about it 
And she gave us a free meal
How nice of her
We didn't expect it but she did

Great job, Christina"}
{"text":"I was in the area this morning and couldn't think of anywhere to eat 
It was 10:58am and I was craving something that would fill me
I almost went across to Chipotle but a huge burrito in the morning? 

There was a couple of other people waiting to have lunch at 5guys when I was there and we were let in right at 11:00am

The cashier was nice and friendly
She made sure that my order was correct and was very friendly

I got a cheeseburger with everything, minus the mushrooms
I also got a little cup of fries
and a soda

I love that the Coke Freestyle machines are popping up all over
I was happy to have Cherry Coke

Mind you, this was all at 11:00am, don't judge me

The burger was really good, and so were the fries

I sat near the window and I was amused by watching the Jimmy John bikers make deliveries
I never knew they had so many people on bikes for deliveries
Nevertheless I was entertained"}
{"text":"Five Guys is Five Guys.  Simple, friendly, delicious, inexpensive.  Perfect for a quick burger and fries, and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I've tried different burger places and I would say for consistency and taste five guys is hard to beat.."}
{"text":"A Junior Cheeseburger combo and a Hot Dog at nearly $24 is pretty spendy, especially when The Works is a block away.  Sure, the burger is good, but I can't begin to fathom the value proposition here. You can have a sit down meal at Lone Star for under $20.  I like the burgers, but I can't justify making frequent visits."}
{"text":"Simple, good pucks. Unlike South Street, the burgers are fried on the flattop, yielding a nice crust on the outside and a juicy experience on the inside. I added saut√©ed mushrooms, Carmelized onions, cheese and bacon. 

O don't understand why anyone would eat at McD's when a burger at 5 guys is so much better for only a couple bucks more.  This is just an honest burger joint. Sure, I really enjoy some of the more adventurous, exotic burgers, but 5 Guys is just a foundational reference point for burger enjoyment.  And every so often I just need a good dose of foundation."}
{"text":"I've been to Five Guys a few times now.  I think their burgers are much better than what you get at most fast food places (like McDonalds and Wendy's just across the street), but it's still behind really great burger chains like In-N-Out and especially Cook-Out (whom I've separately reviewed).

Their fries are pretty good and are along the lines of the old Boardwalk Fries places.  A big peeve I have, though, is that when you order a basic burger-and-fries combo, they put your burger in a bag and then dump hot fries right on top of it.  If you don't rip your bag open to get at your burger (or eat all your fries first--and they do tend to give you a lot of fries), you end up nearly burning your fingers trying to get at your burger.

I found the staff to be really friendly, efficient, and quick.  I don't mind the pretty limited menu that's in line with a \"do few things, but do them right\" philosophy, but they could probably improve on the unfinished floor.  That and the cheap tables and chairs they have seem to unnecessarily drag down the rest of the place."}
{"text":"The happiest people on earth must work here! I was greeted with enthusiasm and smiling faces. Every part of my visit, I couldn't help but smile, because they were so happy and smiling. When I left, a gentleman they all thanked me. That doesn't happen other places. And by the way, my burger was absolutely awesome. But I would have come back anyway, just for the positive vibe!"}
{"text":"Figured I'd give this place another shot. Got a cheeseburger this time, all black toppings minus mushrooms. Just not worth the price. It's not a bad burger but I can easily get the same quality for quite a bit less elsewhere. Seriously, to feed a family of 4 costs $50-60. At those prices I expect much higher quality, as in brioche bun, grass fed local beef, yada yada yada...

Layout is not the best either, but most places get that screwed up."}
{"text":"foods ok. came quick. pretty clean. 

Update: Hotdogs at five guys, are awesome."}
{"text":"Meh, it's just a burger and soggy fries. What's the big attraction? Menu reminds me of In-And-Out."}
{"text":"I love peanuts so I like that while you're waiting you can much on an unlimited supply. 

The burger was meh for me. I got a plain nd for $9~ you can certainly buy a combo at McDonalds/Wendys that taste better. 
The problem with the burger was that the patty was bland.. do they not season their burgers with salt/pepper? 
If they used quality meat, then I'm sure some resemblance to a meat taste would come through. Unfortunately it did not.

I took my burger to go & have at home but the bun became soggy (they wrap their burgers in aluminium foil). Again, bad idea but just a tip for those taking it to go.

Canjun fries are good - however bits and pieces of end fries are not pleasing.

Probably won't be back. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Slightly bigger Five Guys location than the others I've been to (Concord mills and East Arbors Dr). They offer all of the menu options, have a ketchup and malt vinegar station as well as the ever popular choose-your-own coca cola machines.

I have noticed that this location is not consistent when it comes to making their french fries. Some visits, they're perfectly crispy and lightly salted. Other times? hard and barely any flavor.

Definitely a good spot if you're craving a burger. Yes it's going to cost more than your typical fast food joint but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I never thought I would be writing this but someone at five guys PLACED A TOENAIL clipping in one of the hand burgers I bought. 

I immediately notified the manager ( a fellow names Rodney if I'm not mistaken) and called the corporate number to notify. 

As of today (this happened on Friday night) no one has reached out to me. I am not looking for money or free burgers ( you couldn't pay me to eat there anymore).

All I want is them to find that sick bastard who did that. It is the most vile thing a person could do. 

Do not eat there."}
{"text":"The wife was craving Five guys yesterday....so since we were in the neighborhood we decided to stop at this location. Since I don't eat red meat I had the Cajun fries which are pretty good.....but the highlight for me was my introduction to PEACH SPRITE. Five guys has introduced these fabulous Coke product machines throughout all of there restaurants and they draw long lines. You can put together many different combinations of drinks from peach sprite to coke lime......from pink lemonade to raspberry lemonade.....from grape sprite.....to vanilla coke....I mean the list goes on and on. So while this will not be one of my first choices for food....it could be a great choice for my beverages in the future.....especially for PEACH SPRITE.....yummy. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"It looks impressive, taste is just OK,  price is too high!  
Tried this place for the first time last weekend.  I got the double bacon cheeseburger with Cajun fries and a drink,  my boyfriend got the same minus the bacon.  We were a bit thrown back to see the bill was $37! When I received my order the burger was big,  fries were massive....  The taste was like a homemade burger I could make at home.  The Cajun Spice never did the fries any favours,  not spicy at all,  just messy.  I was also disappointed that they  used processed cheese on the burger,  spoiled the taste in my opinion. 
All in all it was a good burger,  not worth all the hype or the price,  just middle of the road.  I don't think I'll be returning...  My burger quest continues...."}
{"text":"First time eating their and I was not impressed with the quality of their food.  Could not even taste the burger and their were to many fries.  I ordered  all the way Cheese burger and the bun tasted like alot of yeast in it in fact it took away from the burger in the taste. I have not eaten their before and I had heard alot about the 5 guys, but they need to cut down on their fries alot of waste, no taste in the meat and I paid $9.39 for my meal, would I go their again I don't think so.  I would go to In-an Out before going their again."}
{"text":"Great burger place. We've been coming here for years but I always forget to write a review. I'm originally a SoCal guy so In n Out and Fatburger will always hold a special place in my heart. But Five Guys is right up there with them. The cheeseburger is excellent and the fries are also great."}
{"text":"Don't. Just don't.

We were actually on our way to Makimono when we drove by Five Guys and the smell of grilled burgers clouded our judgement.

The restaurant itself is a little confusing. It kinda looks like its a 50's diner but the music that's blaring (and I mean BLARING!) was not of that era.

We placed our order and shuffled along to wait. At the back of the restaurant we noticed a big box of peanuts in the shell for the taking so we scooped up a container and went to sit down until our number was yelled out.

I don't quite get the peanut connection... in fact, nothing about this restaurant makes sense. From the outdated reviews of praise on the walls to the 50's decor to the cheap faux-wood metal chairs to the peanuts to the blaring music from the 80's. Am I missing something? I don't get it.

When our burgers were finally ready, our number was yelled and my husband went to retrieve them. Although we were eating in, everything had been tossed into a paper bag to go. What a mess... but perhaps an indicator of what was to come next. 

Further disappointment.

The burgers were horrible. They looked horrible and they tasted horrible. For the amount of money these burgers costs, you'd think they could use a little seasoning in the meat. The fries, unfortunately, fell flat as well. Literally. They were triple fried but still came our limp and soggy... and again, under-seasoned. What an injustice to PEI potatoes. You should be ashamed!

Heed my warning... do not let the smell of grilling burgers draw you in. Just keep driving."}
{"text":"After hearing loads of hype about Five Guys, I finally had an opportunity to give one a try. I like the concept, and I like the execution, but at the end of the day, it's still a fast food burger, and I think I may even prefer Wendy's (and for the folks in California, the only similarity to In-N-Out is the primary product - the hamburger - and the colour scheme - Five Guys doesn't even have a drive thru).

One thing that I like about Five Guys is how customizable the burgers are. The signs let you know which items the cooks can dress your burgers with. And they're also up-front with their vegetarian options, which include;

a) A veggie sandwich
b) A veggie sandwich with cheese
c) A grilled cheese sandwich.

And I still have no idea what the difference is between a veggie sandwich with cheese and the grilled cheese sandwich.  Both apparently customizable with the same fixins as the meaty burgers. Five Guys doesn't offer a veggie patty. Sarah went with the grilled cheese sandwich, which is grilled on an inverted hamburger bun, with mayo slathered on the outsides in lieu of butter.

Fries are fresh, and made from real potatoes. They are delicious, but I wish you could order them in a smaller size.

And let's get to the actual burger. The patties are fairly thin - I recommend the double if you want to feel as if you're eating something of substance. The patties are apparently hand formed, but like all Canadian burgers, are well done and not especially juicy, but still provided that general burger eating thrill.

My one issue with the burger was that the processed cheese wasn't entirely melted. At my beloved In-N-Out, I can always rely on having melted cheese.

I will gladly return to Five Guys, but will never go out of the way to eat at one. Thankfully, this one is located just off of the highway."}
{"text":"So I love burgers, but rarely try these new-fangled burger joints as I usually prefer something else.  This time though we were in Newmarket and the place was right next to the Mastermind store, so we thought we'd give it a shot.

The place is very sparsely decorated, but was quite large and very busy, though this was on a Friday night so perhaps that's expected.  There are stories on the wall about the chain having the 'best $5 burger' you can buy.  Interestingly enough, the burgers start at $7 (unless you count their tiny 'little burger').  I guess inflation has run rampant in the few years since they started out?

Ordering was quick though took probably 10 minutes for the order to arrive.  In the meantime, they offer self-serve peanuts (in shell) to munch on, which was kinda nice.  And they proudly proclaim that their fries are cooked in 100% peanut oil as well.  Needless to say, if you're allergic, steer clear - very clear - of this establishment!

I didn't try the fries but opted for the regular burger with all the trimmings.  I found it good not great - the burger tasted nice and 'real' - like the ones I make at home, but the shape/thickness seemed inconsistent.  I'm not expecting a uniform patty, but these seemed a big on the extreme side of inconsistent.  Anyways taste-wise, bun good, meat good, toppings good.  Everything good.  But anything great?  Not really.  It was kinda meh.  For $5, this would've been 4 stars.  But for $7?  I find it hard to find a reason to come back.  For my money, I still think Hero Burger is a better choice.  Though maybe I'll swing back and try the fries sometime.."}
{"text":"After hearing that this place was not only the talk of the town but also our esteemed President's favorite, I figured I'd give it a try.  Sadly, I'm not impressed.

There was nothing wrong with my dinner, but I expect a burger and fries costing $11+ to be more than just ok.  In the end though, Five Guys tastes like a neighborhood cookout.  The burger was fine--nothing unexpected, and the fries tasted homemade.  

They seem to be going for a less-is-more motif in the store.  Unfortunately, it just comes off as cold and cheap--In-N-Out does the clean 50s diner look a lot better, and Smashburger does the upscale burger menu better.

It won't kill you, but you'll feel like you got overcharged."}
{"text":"The food was great as usual, but what stood out to me was the friendly customer service. Despite being busy with a lot of customers, they took the time to smile and talk to each person. The team that worked on 10 June during lunch deserves a lot of credit. They were quick, and the food didn't lack quality. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with burgers and fries. The food is always consistent. The staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Not too crazy over Five Guys.  $9 for a small burger I don't know.  Mind you it was tasty and the party was juicy but when you ask for jalape√±os and get 1 that's disappointing.  They get a 3 because it tasted good."}
{"text":"I ended up trying this 
Five Guys again due to a large family outing and I was pleasantly surprised by the burger being good!!  All eight people agreed the food was good!"}
{"text":"I picked up to go food yet again from here Wednesday.  The burgers were ok but the (almost $6.00) order of fries were gross! They were undercooked and greasy! I tried to inform the manager (Chris) on Thursday. He had the audacity to rudely want to argue about it! I know the fries at 5 Guys aren't suppose to be crispy!"}
{"text":"Good food, the peanut oil is so much better for you. I got there at 1055, and they opened right at 11, the manager was super nice and the staff was super motivated to help me.

Got there enjoyed my food, they threw an extra patty on my burger, which is cool since I'm a fat ass.
I left came back 30 minutes later and used their bathroom, I think I stuffed up their toliet with TP and poop. So I'm writing this review to make amends for my folly.

Sorry bro."}
{"text":"Great burger the way I want it, but the best part is the large portion of fries. It's been awhile since we've been here. When they opened, we were here every other week. Burnt out! Now we are back. Maybe we will go every other month or so. Yes, will return."}
{"text":"Just an ok burger. I know I'm not the only one that thinks this place is WAY over priced. People must love to be parted with their money. A burger, small fries and soda with tax is over $11 friggin dollars here. I'd rather get 2 double doubles from In n Out for $7, and be WAY more satisfied. Five Guys burger is messy and falla sapart easy and the fries are not so great.

I'll be at In n Out any day over this place, save your money folks."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time however today will be my last trip. The burgers are amazing there's no question about that however the service was terrible. First and foremost the cashier needs to take that tongue piercing out of she is unable to speak with it in. I'm also not a fan of their fries so I tried to order them crispy and the cashier just simply told me no. Saying that they way they come is the way they come. You're telling me I just spent $50 here and I can't get the fries the way I would like them?! It was also filthy inside. I know they are busy and I completely expected peanuts to be everywhere but the amount of trash every where was ridiculous."}
{"text":"OMG these guys know how to make a burger taste so good you want to chew each bite as many times as you can just to savour the flavour longer"}
{"text":"The food was on par with other Five Guys locations. Did experience some of the best customer service and hospitality on this trip."}
{"text":"Loved their burgers so many choices of ingredients to add to ur burger. Steak sauce, mushrooms,  grill bell peppers & jalape√±os. Everything tasted fresh n meat was very juicy. Their cajun fries were good too. Love the peanuts they have for u to eat while u wait."}
{"text":"I'm giving this location 4 stars for the fast and friendly service we received at our visit tonight. 

I'm not a big fan of their fries and their burger was just fair. The bread was nice and moist and the meat was tender but lacked seasoning. I loved the new touch soda machines and the location is fairly clean.

Is five guys my most favorite burger spot? Unfortunately not, but the experience given by the staff bumped it up a few notches. We were sitting outside and the staff came out to give us our food and even checked on us 15 min later to see if we were still doing ok. Great customer service because they really didn't have to do any of that. My guy friend would disagree with me and say that five guys is his go to burger joint but we can all agree to disagree. What I do know is that it's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"My favorite burger in town! Why? Cause you can truly make it your way! We originally ate at the NYC location and we're so excited to see them open locations here.  Love the Cajun fries! Loved when they added the mix and match multi Coke machine.  How fun & yummy!"}
{"text":"Clean, good service, but not exactly my fave fast food joint. Glad that they have a vegetarian option here! they have a grilled veggie sandwich option which is basically like a cheeseburger minus the meat ha. I've had it a few times and it's not great. You can get a significantly better veggie option at other fast food burger joints (..in n out grilled cheese..). It just lacks in flavor, I found myself dunking it in ketchup. However, their fries are the big winners. Some of the best fries. Perfect size fry, not to skinny not too big and good amount of crisp. Yum! The ones with seasoning on them are good too, but I went with original during my trip here yesterday.
Prices aren't too bad, cost me about $7.50 for more than enough food to fill me up. Plus it's good quality stuff. Never had bad service here or had an order get messed up. Also I like the fancy soda machine they have haha. So as a non-meat eater, I might not be the best person to give this review, but this place isn't too shabby in my opinion!"}
{"text":"So good. Too good. A bacon cheeseburger and fries that are pretty much the best in Chandler but the 1500 calories, give or take, make it too much to have as often as I'd like. A \"small\" fries is more than enough since they dump a bunch of extra fries in the bag as well."}
{"text":"The sad soggy bun just could not hold it together. 

What a mess."}
{"text":"Their burgers are Amazing! If your craving a burger this is the place to go! They've got 3 items on the menu, burgers, fries, and drinks. Also their small fry is the equivalent a a big fry elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sadly the burger tastes a lot like Fuddruckers burgers.  Not that this is bad, it just seems like there is too much sauce going on.  Part of the problem is that you get to build your own burger and I tend to go overboard.  It is a very limited menu, the burgers come in various sizes and the fries come by the bagful.  The fries are delicious.  The lines can get really long in this location but you can order ahead on-line.  Overall, it's a good burger, but I'm not sure its worth the calories."}
{"text":"Not too big on burgers but this place definitely changed that mindset. I tried Five Guys when it first opened but haven't been back until recently. Totally forgot how good the burgers were! 

I got a Little Bacon Cheeseburger and it was soo good!! Everything was just perfect, from having a burger patty that was crispy on the outside, to melted cheese and super crispy bacon to go with it. Also tried the cajun fries which was amazing!

They don't really offer combos. You have to add on the drink and fries, but with a super filling burger, I can see why making it a combo isn't a common thing. 

They also have free peanuts which is great! Good way to occupy time while they make your burgers fresh!

Overall, this visit just got me hooked and I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The burgers are fried and delicious. Second to none in the fried varierty. The hand cut french fries come to you by the bushels. Sauteed onions and heavy melted cheese make them the best. the service is exceptional. You can't make them this good at home."}
{"text":"Very clean, I like clean.  

I was afraid of ordering the big burger because I thought it would be something out of man vs food.  I went with the small burger and it didn't disappoint.  The guys I went to lunch with all got the big burger and I have to say, I couldn't tell the difference.  So don't let it scare you like it did me.

All in all it was a very tasty, greasy burger.  Medium fries are more than enough.  I don't particularly care for fries with skin still on though. I liked that they gave you peanuts to snack on while you wait because the wait was a little longer than I would have expected for fast food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a burger, you can't really go wrong with Five Guys. 

I also make a Five Guys run when I'm craving fresh, hot french fries. I'd love to avoid this, but I'm weak. 

Major pluses are the menu layout here, and the attentiveness of staff. I have been to this location a handful of times and order came out perfect every time. Given that there are so many permutations to ways people like their burgers, I appreciate the attention to detail. I'd go so far to say that I don't typically get this kind of attention to detail in many sit down restaurants. 

Only drawback for me is take out, as your burger will be soggy when you get home. Advise if you are planning on grabbing family dinner on your way home, to be sure to have them put the sauce in a side container for you. 

Other drawback is eating all your fries before your burger and not getting through your burger..."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Five Guys restaurant since Norman, OK. so decided to give them a try and happy that we did. My husband had a large hamburger and I had a regular and we split the regular fries ( fries were enough for at least another person to share). The restaurant was clean and you do have to order your food up front but this we didn't mind.  The workers were very nice and didn't rush us. Will come back again."}
{"text":"To start many food service places provide many discounts. This discounts range from senior, student, to military. My son and I stopped for a burger after a long bicycle ride from 20th Street and Indian School. We were hungry. I'm re-tired Military so I always ask if there is a discount. I was told NO, I asked how about senior or student, NO...  I really felt that the person I was talking to was pretty put off by me asking. Because we were hungry knowing the burger would be good we stayed.
I asked if they could fry my mushrooms and onions together with mustard, I was told no so No.. I guess you cannot order the burgers the way you like them...

COST way too high,,,, just 2 as teh menu showed \"Little\" burgers and 2 sodas = 18.00 WOW at \"In n Out\" we could have had 2 doubles \"meat\" animal style with fry's and sodas..

Oh ya this was Sunday at 4pm, we were one of two groups in the seating area. I guess everyone know how over priced the food is.. Ya ask why did we stay, we were just hungry no other reason..."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Five Guys Burger. My friend from Nebraska keeps telling me I need to try it as I am in love with In-N-Out and Smashburger. Finally got my chance!

I ordered a Little Cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushrooms and my husband ordered a Cheeseburger with everything on it. Also ordered a regular fries and a large green tea to share. We dug in and the burgers were pretty good! Only junk thing is that it fell apart and it was a tad bit messy. I also realized that my \"Little Cheeseburger\" was not so little and my husband didn't realize his regular has two patties. The burgers do cost a little more but you do get a lot more food for the price. Even the fries were huge enough to share.

It was a pretty good burger place. They also had free peanuts when we walked in. Next time I will opt for more toppings."}
{"text":"Our second visit and will have to admit the peanuts and fries are better than the hamburgers. Even when it isn't busy why does the employees seem to rush you? if you don't order your food in a single breath or sentence they think that is all you want and try to cut you off. Burgers were a little undercooked because they are in a rush when when don't have to be. The burger patties are thinner than the first time and being undercooked wasn't a good thing. Is it my imagination or did the buns get smaller too?... I found a new appreciation of a weird flavor in the soda machine though, it's Orange Coke. I will go back for the peanuts and the fries, both are delicious. Something about those peanuts, I really like.
I would probably go to T-Bird or Carls Jr for a burger if I was in this area to eat a hamburger or just order fries and eat peanuts next time?"}
{"text":"The service was really great. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I've only eaten here a few times, but the food is pretty good. Fries are tasty (highly recommend getting them with cajun style) But the burger I had today was out of this world, delicious. I don't know if they are always this good or if I was really hungry, but I was seriously impressed. The cheese was in between two patty's. Genius. Maybe I only ordered the Little Cheeseburger before? I'm not sure, but I'm definitely going back to do some more research on this tasty burger. 

Peanuts all over the place isn't really my thing, but a nice gesture if you are starving while you wait. The staff was so sincerely nice that I feel like it deserves mentioning twice. I do think this place is a little pricey, when you can get In n out for much cheaper, but sometimes paying a little more is worth it."}
{"text":"We had a late night meal here after going to pick up a drunk from Nascar. 

The Staff was more then excellent, man did those young guys have the customer service skill down. They asked all the right questions the register while ordering, offered to refill drinks for an elderly couple, cleaned and wiped tables for people. I was impressed. 

The food was standard 5 guys, which is one reason to continue to go here. Quality and consistency. 

While I think 5 guys is an average burger I gave the extra stars for the staff here."}
{"text":"While it is not a preferred way of cooking beef. I am a fan. 

Service is great, Jim T was more then helpful while ordering and made the experiance even better. 
The place is always clean, the peanuts keep me happy and the burgers do not disappoint."}
{"text":"Food still yummy but wait on web order was ridiculous.  They totally forgot I was there. My burger was cold when I got home which is annoying bc I paid 7.00 for it. My fries were hot but with a soggy burger...not worth it. 

May need to venture out to smash burger."}
{"text":"I came in one night because I wanted to give this place a try. I got a Little hamburger with the basic toppings. The second time I came I got it with jalape√±os. I really like the beef patties, but the part that sold it for me was the ultimate customization. The jalape√±os were really hot too! It's so nice to get a good jalape√±o burger with my favorite sauce of all time...A1. The other part that sold me was the soda machines at this location. The soda machines are worth the trip! It is the only place I can indulge in my favorite soda of all time; Caffeine Free Diet Coke with Lime. I like the peanuts too, but the fries are OK. I prefer McDonalds or In-n-out to these fries, but I think the first comes down to personal taste, so I never order them. Go try them yourselves!"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch, this place is amazing! The burgers are huge and they are absolutely the best \"fast\" food burger you can buy. They are a bit on the pricey side so don't be too shocked when it is over $11 for a burger, frys, and a drink. But it is worth every penny. The services is usually pretty fast and they are always busy, today there was a line literally out the door."}
{"text":"I had the unfortunate experience of having my credit card number lifted by one of the workers......female.....I only used that card once and in three days I received a fraud alert from my bank. After some investigation work and finding out when the charge was made and where,  iI was able to get a copy of the survalence camera and found the individual who made a poor copy of my card.
I use to love tHis place......never more."}
{"text":"I don't really have a major problem with Five Guys, but I can't figure out what all the fuss is about! Aside from the \"I need/want Five Guys\" jokes, which get old pretty fast, I'm not certain what the major draw is for an establishment such as this. The burgers themselves aren't bad. They remind me of the type of burgers that one would cook in their back yard. The beef patty is juicy with good flavor and the decent portion size has not gone unnoticed, but for the price I just don't see how they can compete with some of the heavy hitters such as Smashburger or Inn-n-Out.

Sure they have one of those fancy soda machines that let's you customize your drink from 5 billion possible flavor combinations and not to mention free peanuts that you can break and eat at your leisure. And sure, they have exceptional customer service, but for me personally, the negatives outweigh the positives.

I guess perhaps the three main issues I have with the joint are the noise, price, and the fries. Every time I have come to this Five Guys the employees are shouting orders to each other while customers are sometimes sitting less than 15 feet away. Not sure if this just a quirk about the restaurant, but it's kind of annoying and prevents me from effectively conversing with the people at my table if I am forced to sit too close to the front counter when the place is busy. As far as the french fry situation goes, I am all for Five Guys hooking it up with giant portion sizes but this all comes at the expense of having to eat said extra fries directly out of their brown paper bag."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money.  I have heard good reviews of this place and gave it a try. The burgers are very, very, very greasy and not flavorful at all. The toppings and bun slide all over when you try to eat the burger. I love a good burger and this place is a complete waste of time. If you want the best burger in the Phoenix area go to The Chuckbox in Tempe. The Chuckbox is 10 times better than this crap place."}
{"text":"I have lived in Ahwatukee for 10 years, I truly know why I have never came her, I know why I won't come again!! I paid 18.10 for a regular (small) hot dog, small ch burger, & this abundance amount of fries?"}
{"text":"So excited to check out there new location right in university! From when we where greeted until we left they did great. Hopefully they keep it up. You can tell manager cares about the restaurant. He was directing people to clean up and communicating what needed to be done. Food was cooked well and ready fast."}
{"text":"Well after a long debate we decided to give this burger joint another chance, last I was ok but can't say the same for my other half. Last night we trying to decide between Millers Ale House or Five Guys Burgers, we went for the burgers and I am paying dearly for it this morning. The place always seems clean and the fries are the best in town, but having a another stomach issue two times in a row has put them on the places that I won't be going back to again!!"}
{"text":"Huge cheeseburgers with a large selection of free toppings?  Enough fries to build a small home?  A computerized soda fountain with over 120 choices?  5 stars for sure.

Also, the online ordering was easy to use.  

Hopefully this will drive some of the fast food chains in the area out of business..."}
{"text":"Why are there three Yelp locations for this? Lol. Anyways, I don't know what it is, I just never liked Five Guys fries. I like their burgers & how big they are & I love that there are so many options. On top of that, their soda machine is fabulous. I wish every fast food place had one like that. The customer service is great here, I prefer this over the Eastern location. They are also fast here. I don't really understand the peabut theme they have going on, & I actually think it's a disservice that they use peanut oil. Think of how many people have peanut allergies these days. Using another oil would be a more considerate alternative, but that's just my opinion. I'll definitely keep going here for quick lunches with my friends."}
{"text":"If you looking for a good burger but don't mind spending an extra buck or two this is a great place."}
{"text":"You want a fast food burger, come here! Burgers here are amazing and it's worth any drive to at least try. I love Five Guys Burgers and frys, and I love that they use peanut oil for everything and the complimentary peanuts that are available in the store. I love this place so much and it's been so long since I've had a burger, I can't wait to come back and have it again."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed in the least. Nothing fancy... Basic toppings like white onions, iceberg lettuce, and processed cheese. If I'm paying more than McDonalds prices, I want better than a slice of off brand processed cheese on my burger. Maybe even a choice of American, cheddar, or a white cheese. Also, when going out specifically for a burger, a milkshake would be great along side it. Its just hamburgers, cheeseburgers, hotdogs, sodas. If you order a regular burger/cheesebuger, be aware that it has 2 patties. A regular sized fry is enough for 2 people. The place is LOUD. It gets quite annoying lsitening to the employees yell out how many people just walked thru the door, as if we didnt see them. They also have a worker constantly yelling out how long its taking to dish out burgers from order to pick up time. I like the fact that they tell the cooks if they need to speed up or not, but it just gets ridiculous constantly hearing them yell at each other. The only things I enjoyed about Five Guys is the free peanuts, the cool soda machine with endless options, and the homemade tasting fries. All in all, I will stick to Smash Burger or Fatburger where there are more options, better topping, and more bang for my buck."}
{"text":"This five guys gets five stars!!!!!  I went here to treat my vendor for lunch.  I ordered eight burgers all of them completely different with so many twists and turns I was certain they would get something wrong. Mind you this is a carry out that I'm delivering to my vendor. 

I forgot to ask them to put names on each one so that each was easily identifiable but they were 10 steps ahead of me. They numbered them in the order I ordered them off of this sheet of paper I handed them and placed them in bags in numerical order. I didn't check the order as I didn't have all day to inspect all these sandwiches with the many different toppings. I just grabbed the order which took less than 15 minutes to fill during a busy lunch hour and darted off to fill some hungry bellies. 

There want one mistake!!! Everything was perfect and tasted awesome. One of the guys called me the next day saying the food was so good he was have five guys again the next day."}
{"text":"5 Guys is an odd name, but whatever works for you.  This burger joint claims to be one of the best around the nation.  Just look at all the signs they post and how proud they are; granted I appreciate confidence.  Burgers here are mediocre - nothing to rave about and crave for during those sleepless nights.  Fries are my favorite since they're real chopped potatoes.  Atmosphere...what I can't hear you?  Yeah, I generally don't enjoy places where I have to debate whether to dance or eat :("}
{"text":"Update:

Saw a cockroach......sorry not coming back. 


Original review


Regular burgers are actually 2 patties so order the little burger if you want one. 
Also if you order regular fries its big enough to share. They give you a cup of fries and then pour another containers worth into the bag!

Burger is super juicy!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Just wow.  This place serves up what is easily one of the best burgers I've ever had.  My wife and I each had the standard cheeseburger and they were magnificent.  Juicy, tasty and delicious.  Veggie toppings were fresh and crisp.  Our fries were perfect too (I had cajun, the wife had regular fries).  A \"little\" serving of these was tons (next time we'll share one).  

I also want to comment on the outstanding customer service.  When we walked up to the counter we were greeted with a smile and our order was quickly taken.  Loved the fancy coke machines and it's variety of drinks (especially diet options - yeah I know its crazy to pair a diet drink with a burger and fries, but regular soda is too sweet for my tastes).  Place was clean too - immaculately so.  While I waited for the food, my wife took our drinks outside.  During the brief wait one of the folks working in the seating area asked if I'd like some peanuts and a cup for water.  I accepted the peanuts, but when I mentioned my wife had my drink outside so I didn't need the water she took my wife a cup of peanuts as well.  Just amazing service.  

My only complaint? I wish there was a tip line on the receipt.  I almost never carry cash, and I would have liked to leave a tip for these great workers.  No that I know, I'll be sure to bring in some cash next time.  The owner and manager of this Five Guys outpost should be proud - their staff is outstanding."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Five Guys, you are missing out. I've only had single cheeseburgers and fries, but each time is the same great experience. They have an insane amount of toppings to pick from, which gives you more bang for your buck. Don't expect to order your food and have it waiting for you in 1-2 minutes; instead, get your drinks and some peanuts and sit down for about 6-7 minutes. As you will find out, the bun holds up to the amount of toppings, at least for a single patty burger it does. Their fries and so much better than anywhere else, no exaggeration. The potatoes they use for their fries are from different areas and I think I have always had them from different areas of Idaho- everyone knows that Idaho is known for their potatoes! My kids get milkshakes every time, but come on, all kids love all milkshakes. Plus, they have Coca Cola Freestyle soda so it's a win-win! This isn't the cheapest place to get burgers and fries, but they are better than any where else in my opinion."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm cheating on In-and-Out whenever I eat at Five Guys. I'm going to be honest. I LOVE In-and-Out, the pride and joy of the west coast.

BUT Five guys is pretty darn good. I love that you can customize your burgers. Gooey cheese... grilled onions, mushrooms, peppers what ever pleases your taste buds.  

The fries were excellent and even better than In-and-Out, especially when you add their Cajun seasoning. The prices were decent (though more expensive than In-and-Out after you include their fries and drink).

Is this the best fast food burger I've ever eaten? No, but it is pretty gosh darn good for fast food burgers. This is better than your average burger, so look out Culver's. I'm hungry now!"}
{"text":"I've driven past them enough times to finally decide to give it a go. It's another typical yet not so typical gourmet burger place. 

They have peanuts....like a ton of it and you can have as much as you desire.

I think I like the fact that I can make my own burger and put whatever I want in it and they'll make it to order!! So get creative and put all your favorites in there!

Now what's really to die for is their fries, I'm always up for delicious fries over anything else really. And their fries with cajun seasoning is DELICIOUS, my first time ever and I fell in love with it. I'd totally just come back for fries and skip the burger.

The price is pretty decent, it's not too expensive but still it can all add up when you're adding fries, drinks, etc to your order. 

It's really clean inside as well, which for the area is pretty awesome. I rarely find clean places anymore and when I find one, I like going back to those places."}
{"text":"Mr. Rosie S. and I came to this location for a late lunch on a Friday in May - there were 4 or 5 other parties there at the time, 

The highlight of our visit was the staff for sure. Each and every one went out of their way to make our experience awesome.

1. Cashier / order-taker: Chatted with us before and after taking our order - actually interested in a conversation. Nice.

2. Cook / fry god: Threw in an extra LARGE fries-worth of fries into our bag. Yessss!

3. Cleaner / floor-sweeper:
As she came by sweeping up the peanut shells, she checked in and asked how everything was, or if we needed anything!

THE FRIES ARE SO GOOD IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL. Nommmnomnomnomnom I normally don't indulge in deep fried things with such abandon but GOSH these were great!!! The large we ordered would have been more than enough for the two of us to share, and we got DOUBLE that, so we took home and re-heated in the oven later that nice! 

\"Juicy burger, crispy bacon. What more can you ask for?\" says Mr. Rosie S. - so he obviously loved the burger.

They do a great job of branding! It's simple, but very effective.

There is a huge vat of peanuts by the ketchup area and cute little cardboard boats that people can fill and take to their table to munch on while waiting for their meal (made to order is a nice touch).

Also I enjoy pop fountains. Call me crazy but I love mixing Orange Fanta and Gingerale. Wheeeeeee!

Like other locations, there are bags of potatoes all over the place here - in this case, they define the line-up area. Cute!"}
{"text":"Came in to finally try the burgers here.

Ordered a \"Little Bacon Burger\" with mayo, mustard, lettuce & tomatoes. Nothing fancy, just wanted to taste the burger mainly.

It was pretty awesome. Tasty. Fresh. Made to order.

If you're expecting your brain to melt, you're gonna walk away disappointed.

But I got a tasty burger, which is what I wanted. Will be back, to try out the fries."}
{"text":"Five Guys makes a good burger and serves up heaping orders of freshly made fries. So I was happy to see the new South Boulevard location open recently. 

The menu is pretty simple. If you're looking for a normal-sized burger, you'll want to get the \"little\" burger or cheeseburger. The regular one comes with two patties and, well, it's a lot of beef. The fries are just perfect. Perfect crispiness, perfect seasoning, so very greasy. 

Five Guys is good for takeout, though you'll have to wait a couple minutes for your food since it's made to order. You can also call ahead."}
{"text":"Their burger really hit the spot! I had a little burger and my boyfriend had a regular burger (which is a double patty).  I really liked the fries and the fact that they tell you where the potatoes come from. I also like that they have a lot of topping options that they don't charge you for.  It wasn't the best burger I had but it was good enough that I would go back again."}
{"text":"Juicy burgers made to order on the flat top in front of me, fresh ingredients an abundance of fries and let's not forget about the anything I could dream of coke dispenser...good burger and fry place"}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with a burger from Five Guys? The burgers and fries are always great! I love that they have the self-serve soda machine with every flavor combination imaginable. If you are going during the lunch rush, make sure you are ready to scope out a table where people are almost done eating or be prepared to take it to go. This place gets packed during lunch and there have been times I've struggled to find a table."}
{"text":"The manager at this location is awesome...ib had to ask his name to make sure credit for outstanding customer service goes to Jon...he literally greet everyone who walked through the door...it's nice especially these days to get that kind of service. ..seriously,  he deserves an award."}
{"text":"After eating a burger and some fries here, my heart ached for In & Out...I miss you guys so much...I miss my animal style fries, protein burgers, and the real milshakes at In & Out for only $6. *sigh* I'm sorry if I didn't eat you everyday and took you for granted...

ANYWAYS, pros are: Free peanuts while you wait, you can make your burger a junior size instead of the monstrous size, and there's a bunch of toppings for you to customize your burger. Cons are: the fries are too thick for my liking, too satly and oily, and not much flavor even though I ordered it cajun style. The burgers need those customized toppings or else their regular cheeseburger just tastes mundane, nothing to brag about. 

It's not comparable to In & Out though. It's more like Fatburger's style of how they make their burgers and the taste of it. They too have the same concept and same ordering style, minus the free peanuts."}
{"text":"This was probably the #1 or #2 burger on my top 5 burger list,,,,,mmm, holy shit it was damn good,  and the fries are like basque style .... so yeah go there!"}
{"text":"I love five guys, and the food is always good quality, but if you're looking for customer service, go to the location on Eastern...I asked for the bacon on my burger to be well done and the lady gave me some excuse about it being cooked in the morning and not able to be put back on the grill...really?!?  Eastern location does it no problem and also accommodates other requests like making fry sauce fresh for you, etc."}
{"text":"Service is always quick. Employees are very friendly and get food out quick. Always fresh and nice and hot. Nobody in the area can match there quality of food."}
{"text":"I was never disappointed in five guys until 2/11/2018. I had a rough day so I wanted to have a satisfying meal for myself. I LOVE their fries even though they are little pricey compared to other burger place fries because they are on point for my taste and gives me a LOT. So I always feel like I get what I paid for. But that day for some reason, they only gave me just to cover the small cup and there was barely any salt on it. It was freshly made so I guess they were rushing (dinner time around 8pm) but still I was sad. 
Maybe I have to go to another five guys for awhile."}
{"text":"Last night was probably the absolute worst experience I've ever had in my life dining out. The staff was beyond rude, and I have no desire to eat here again. What I thought was going to be a good meal with friends turned into a brawl and heated argument. 

I walk into the restaurant, and stand in line. As we get closer to the register, a cook by the name of \"Miles\" (who knows if that is actually his name) points to us and says \"those girls can't eat here. Don't serve them.\" I'm thinking this is all a joke. As my friends approach the register to put in their order, \"Miles\" gets upset and starts throwing around his towel, slamming meat on the grill, throwing his hands up getting all upset. This is when I know \"Miles\" was not kidding about us not wanting to serve us. 

I approach the register because it's my turn now to put in my order. \"Miles\" is still behind the register flailing his hands. I ask him if he had a problem with me and he says \"yea I do.\" I asked him what it was that I did for him to be upset given that the only thing that I did was walk in the restaurant and stand in line. The young man at the register tells me not to mind his behavior, I said okay but I would like to speak with the manager. The young man on the register tells me that he was the manager, which I could hardly believe. 

I proceed down to the waiting area, and another incident occurs. The Same \"Miles\" accuses a young man of putting his hands on another female customer in an inappropriate manner. \"Miles\" tells the man that he needs to get out of the establishment \"because they were privately owned and he could kick out whoever he wanted to.\" Apparently no one sees the man touch a girl, except for \"Miles\" and he was the only one with the issue. 

While I am waiting for my burger to be prepared, the \"Miles\" guy approaches me and he asks me \"so what's up?\"  I have no idea why he approached me when he was supposed to be preparing my order. I tell him that he was a disappointment to me and that he has thoroughly embarrassed me. At this point I am standing next to the female police officer and \"Miles\" is now being more \"careful\" with his words. Another man approaches me at the end of the counter where I'm waiting for my order and asks me what was wrong. I tell him the story of everything that happened and I asked him who he was. He tells me his name was \"Miles\" too and that he too, was the manager. At this point I know all of the staff was playing a game. The \"manager\" says another girl threw the middle finger up at him. I ask what that had to do with me if that girl's sale had ended  and I had a separate receipt for my order. He didn't have an answer to my question. \"Miles\" sees me talking to \"the manager\" and says \"I don't care about that bitch because my check shits on what she makes. I make $70k so I don't have to deal with people like her\". 

I have absolutely no idea what his pay stub has to do with him saying I can't be served when I walk through the door, him calling me out of my name, or the experience I am entitled to have as a customer. \"Miles\" goes into the back kitchen and starts throwing around pots and pans because I tell him I'm done talking to him after his disrespect. \"Miles\" comes out of the kitchen and then interrupts my conversation with The police officer. I asked the police officer if she is seeing the disrespect that I am receiving. She says she can't do anything because he has not broken the law. \"Miles\" leans over the counter and asks me \"if I want to take this outside.\" If you ask me, or anyone else, those are fighting words 1. In the context and 2. In the manner in which he said it. He is threatening me so much that the police officer steps in and says \"no one is stepping outside.\" The \"manager\" approaches me again and asks me my order number. At this rate I was disgusted with the service and disrespect that I don't even want the burger. The \"manager\" takes the receipt out of my hand without my consent and then \"Miles\" throws the burger and fries at me. After that, I tell him that I'll be writing a review  and contacting corporate. \"Miles\" then tells me to \"get the fuck out\" and at this point my friends are walking me out of the restaurant and I leave. After I leave the restaurant he then finds the need to follow me out, leaving his workstation to antagonize me and my friends yelling at us on our way out of the epicenter. Why? I have no answer for this inappropriate mess. Where was his manager and why was it okay to leave his post??

Unfortunately, I am pissed that I paid for my burger and fries and received that level of disrespect and service. Even more pissed that I didn't trust that my burger was safe to eat. If I could post the video that I have of \"Miles\" I would. But I'll be sure to include this in my email to corporate. I was able to capture \"the manager\" and \"miles\" in the video. 

Unfortunately I won't be back. I really liked this place."}
{"text":"Here it is.

5 Guys makes a good burger,  but its not as good as In N Out. It's  not as good as Tommy's.  It 's not as good as any number of places here in Vegas. Why ?  While the burgers are big - they simply lack in FLAVOR,  in my opinion. In N Out,  Tommy 's,  and Fatburger have flavor - their own unique flavors. You know it when you taste it.

I don't fault the overall construction of the burgers,  but the patty tastes bland to me.

To the fries. Overkill, if you get a regular size and your by yourself. A regular size order will feed two easily. If you go by yourself - try the small. The Cajun fries are not hot,  the spices are Very mild in my opinion. The free salted peanuts you can eat while waiting are actually  ( for me anyway )  better than the fries.

The burgers are good,  but not outstanding. 3 stars from me."}
{"text":"From the stale peanuts at the beginning of the line where it starts. Then for $13 bucks, forget it. I can eat for same price for two people and be IN and OUT burger"}
{"text":"The customer service in this place is amazing, i have not been there and left on a bad note. Food is great the people are great the environment is amazing. They definitely deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"Cheeseburgers - great, though over-priced.  Fries - plenty of them, but they are cold, greasy and limp. Blehh..."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!!! Awesome fries!!! Straight from real potatoes! And cooked on site!!!  Every time I come here however I always ask for no bun and they make a big deal about it asking if I would like a lettuce wrap or the burger in a bowl. I have asked for both and each and every time I receive my burger on a bun!!!! Lol. I don't even ask them to change it any more. I just ask for a fork and either do it myself or I eat the bun which is obviously not my intent and puts me wayyy over on calories and carbs!!!  I just do not eat here when I am cutting. Lol."}
{"text":"I don't really get what all the buzz is about. Coming from SoCal I think In N Out has this place beat. I can get a small burger and small fries from Five Guys and I am beyond full the rest of the day. The Cajun fries are OK but I kind of freak out when the bag carrying your food gets stained from all of the grease.
Why I'm giving three stars instead of two is that I JUST discovered their hot dogs and those are FANTASTIC. I never need to have another burger from here, I'll stick with my double doubles......but the hot dogs???? VOILA!!!!
And their soda machine is really cool too. It's touch screen so once you pick your soda, you then get to add flavors. It's really cool. If they had a soda machine on The Starship Enterprise, it would be the soda fountain from Five Guys....except that it would have to be voice command.
Anyway, I'll be back for the weiners and to play with the soda machine"}
{"text":"There is ALWAYS hair in the food... gave them a 4rth chance today and found a blonde hair. Disgusting! They don't make the kids wear hair nets... just hats that do nothing!"}
{"text":"Burger is good, the fries is what got 5 guys to the 4 star review I am leaving. I appreciate the old school burger joint feel where they make everything in front of you and everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"A delicious burger to be sure, and the variety of included toppings is a nice touch (mushrooms and fried onions among them). Parking at the Bramalea City Centre location can be something of a nightmare which unfortunately makes this location slightly less desirable for me personally."}
{"text":"The same great Five Guys burger and fries you'd get at either Brampton location with less of a hassle with parking. Note that you'll be spending more than a typical fast food burger, but this is no fast food burger!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Like the one in Tempe, they also have the newer Coke machines which I LOVE! I was excited to see it since I was able to try it out when I was in Atlanta a couple of years ago, even before they were in any stores or restaurants.  It took me back to being in junior high making a drink with everything on the fountain.  

My burger was just as ordered and my fries were fresh and crunchy.  

They were friendly and the food came out very fast."}
{"text":"The overall pros and cons of five guys burgers...

PROS:
1) No feelers, preservatives, or other bad things for you,
2) The fries
3) Simple ordering, and
4) Free peanuts. 

CONS: 
1) Kind of pricey. 

So, I really like the fact that the burgers are super not messy even though they are pretty big.

Would I recommend? Yes

Will I be back? Good Golly Yes"}
{"text":"Ok so I know you all will think I'm behind the times. Just had 5 guys for the first time. I must say I love all the options for your burger, love the pricing is for two parties already. Fries the little fries was enough for two I actually had to push the bag away Cajun fries were awesome, add a little A-1 to them and they were on fire. I did notice no mention of ranch but I made do. All in all I loved the food and even though they are not the most pocket  they are cheaper then where I would normally go.. I may have found a new burger place let's see how round two goes..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things about Five Guys is when I receive my order in a greasy, brown paper bag filled with fries and my foil-wrapped burgers on top. Opening that bag up and unwrapping that burger isn't nearly as exciting as opening up a present, but it's close.

I ordered the \"Little Cheeseburger\" with grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, and lettuce. This cheeseburger is actually closer to an average-size burger -- I believe you get a little more meat with the regular size. Overall, my burger wasn't bad, but I might add a few bacon strips next time for flavor and crunch. The Five Guys Style fries were OK. They're thick and not really crispy, and they tend to become a little soggy. 

Service was fine and efficient. This shop is busier than other ones that I've been to because of its location, but it does remain consistent to the way Five Guys burgers and fries are prepared."}
{"text":"One Five Guys regular bacon cheeseburger is never enough for me. I find myself saying that after I devour one, along with most of Cajun Fries that I'm supposed to be sharing. 

Five Guys really hits the spot when you're craving a burger while in this part of town -- so does In-N-Out, but that's another review. Taste is consistent throughout other locations I've visited. Can't go wrong with their simple burger selections and variety of toppings -- grilled mushrooms, uh, YES PLEASE.

The fries are definitely not as soggy as fries I've had elsewhere; they're just softer and deliciously greasy. The Cajun Fries have a little heat to them, and they are DELICIOUS.

There's two downsides to this place. First, it's expensive. I paid almost $25 for two burgers, two drinks, and a bag of fries. Those are gourmet burger prices, folks. Secondly, this isn't a major concern, but their menu doesn't differentiate between a regular burger and a little burger -- the former has two patties, while the latter has one. 

This location is large with plenty of seating, unlike the Downtown Summerlin spot that's smaller and always crowded. Also, I do like the service here. 

After giving Five Guys' burgers and fries multiple tries, they've grown on me. There's no turning back now."}
{"text":"was super duper busy when i ordered. but then again, they were a fast food place, and i waited for my To Go order for 25 minutes. They have 5 or 6 people inside their kitchen. And a lot were waiting for their food cos there were some mixed up. Will go back though cos I know those things happen when it's a busy day. The food was bomb specially the hotdog!"}
{"text":"Great fast food tips you need one large fry!!

They need gravy

Great burgers atw with reg with bacon and a1"}
{"text":"Second visit in the last two weeks. We Love this place. Really nice customer service. Very clean. It costs twice for what we get compared to our other fave place, In and Out burger, but worth it because we love the fries! And the burgers are juicier. They offered us a milkshake sample tonight but we were so full and had to decline!
This may become our new fave burger place!"}
{"text":"The burgers here taste homemade. Very delicious. When ordering the fries, make sure to get them Cajun style. I forgot to, but the gentleman on the fryer hooked it up with the Cajun seasoning.. and later into our meal he checked up on us to make sure if we got enough seasoning. These people go above and beyond. The service is top notch. They do a good job of hiring genuinely nice people. Multiple times workers came to our table and checked up on us to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. Just smiles all around :)"}
{"text":"Holy crap!!! I've never had Five Guys Burgers before, but I had the glorious experience of eating take-out from this location. Let me paint a picture...

I ordered Cajun Fries. $3.74. I was just getting a regular order for myself. When this \"cup\" arrived, it was spilling over with a \"Fountain of Fries,\" if you will. This fountain nearly filled this grease-stained brown paper bag. Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking the bag. That's all part of the presentation. But definitely WAY more than I thought I was getting. Pleasantly surprised. 

Then, at the bottom of the fry bag, is my Cheeseburger. Wrapped in tinfoil and HOT. After nibbling on some delicious Cajun Fries, I unwrap this amazing burger and....wow. When they say grilled, they mean grilled ingredients. This is how I wish every burger tasted. 

Overall, this has been an amazing meal. Very much like a backyard BBQ type feel to the food. And I can't wait to order again or dine-in. Definite must-try if you haven't already tried their burgers. I got grilled onions, peppers and jalape√±os on mine and it was DELICIOUS!!!

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I frequent this Five Guys fairly often, and normally have a good experience. Today was the third time I'd ordered through the app, and my experience was nothing like I've had before. I hope it's a fluke, but just in case. I waited 15 minutes for my order after I arrived to pick it up, even though I checked in right when I arrived, and all the while I watched order by order of those who had come after me be called out. Once all the orders were gone, I asked if mine got missed. The girl behind the counter, who was noticeably flustered, asked what number it was. I told her I ordered through the app. She looked around and found my ready made burger sitting in a bag on the shelf, seemingly forgotten. I also had ordered a milkshake, which they made fairly quick after asking twice what add-ins I wanted (something that was clearly printed on the order ticket). Again I hope this is just a fluke."}
{"text":"If you are obese, or desire to become obese, then this is your place!

It's all here.  Big greasy burgers, loads of fries and tons of soda.

It all tastes great.

If that's not enough, be sure to grab some of the free peanuts."}
{"text":"I've finally found a fast food chain worth talking about. For a burger and fries, Five Guys is it for me. The best burger in town hands-down, and they're fries are up there with some of the best fresh cut boardwalk fries in the business. 

In addition to burgers, Five Guys also offers hot dogs, chicken sandwiches and vegetarian options as well. I can only recommend the burgers as I haven't tried anything else, but that's only because I haven't felt the need to. 

They're burgers are absolutely mouthwateringly delicious. If you're an average person a \"little\" burger and a \"little\" size fries is more than enough to satisfy your appetite. If you want to go for their the standard size, be prepared for potential meat sweats and a food coma upon completion. It's too much for me. Seriously, a \"little\" size fries are enough to properly feed 2-4 people. 

The only point that should be noted for anyone with peanut allergies; stay away!!! They're fries are fried in peanut oil, and salted peanuts are available by the caseful throughout the restaurant for patrons to snack on while they wait for their meals (free of charge). It's a nice perk for the rest of us, but for those with an allergy should probably steer clear. 

Other than that, if you want a great burger, and friendly service, in a fast food-type family oriented environment, skip the other guys and head straight to Five Guys."}
{"text":"Oh very good, the burger was freakin delicious! Definitely by top 3 best burgers I ever had."}
{"text":"when i ate the burger i was like \"dayumm! dayumm dayumm!!\""}
{"text":"If I could I would review this place in huge font with just a single word, overrated.  The burgers are burgers but when i found out prices are 40% higher in Canada I was very angry.  These burgers are not worth marking up."}
{"text":"Not very impressed.  Burger was ok, fries Looked great, but mushy
Try Smashburger!!  Sooo much better"}
{"text":"Great burgers, fries and peanuts. I always have them cut my double bacon cheeseburger in half, because I can't eat the whole thing in one sitting. My husband gets his double cheeseburger, we each get a regular soda and split the regular fries.   Our bill  around $23.00. Great place."}
{"text":"I could live on 5 guys fries!  I live the food, in general, but the fries are my favorite.  Being raised in Canada, I love that there is vinegar available!  Keep it up!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"So it was my first time going to a five guys. I was a In n out kind of guy, but wow I will not lie I will never step in another burger joint that is not five guys. As soon as I walked in staff was very friendly greeted me the cashier I think was a manager \"Eric\" he told me the bacon cheese burger with everything was the way to go and boyyyyy was it he told me to try Cajun fries and at first I didn't really know if i liked spicy fries but when I tasted em they where so delicious I gotta give Eric a shout out even gave me some extra bag of fries when he saw I finished them all in all I gotta give that place 5stars and I'll be back that's fersher"}
{"text":"A burger place that is truly \"You can have it YOUR  WAY\"..YOU CAN CREATE hundreds of different burgers here with thier basic menu ...this is my 2nd visit  to 5 guys.I fell in love with the transparent kitchen .the friendly up beat customer service.but truth be told the burger are the best ..Heads up they use peanut oil to prepare the food with..DISCLAIMERS ARE CLEARLY POSTED THREW OUT THIS store"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the freedom of customization that give guys ya to offer when it comes to their burgers, i put them up there with in n out and habit burger. The only downside is their burgers get soggy if you take too long to eat them so i recommend eating it on the spot and not doing to go. Their fry servings are very big and a little is plenty for one person. I defined recommend trying the Cajun fries and a strawberry shake as those compliment the burger well."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices!  Also does a great job for my son who has a dairy allergy."}
{"text":"Super Burger, un peu cher mais quand t'a le go√ªt de te payer la traite!! Les poutines son correct mais pas plus, la sauce brune et le fromage de 3 jours n'en font pas une des meilleures!"}
{"text":"I am still spoiled by the Five Guys of the past, i.e the east coast VA version of yesterday year. Way back in the day, the burgers used to have more meat and now, unless you get a double, you will be asking \"where's the beef?\" The fries are still delicious as always and I love that you can still get as many toppings as you want on you burger, but alas, your patties are getting thinner and thinner. :("}
{"text":"Good burgers, but the prices seem to have gone up since the last time we were at one of these places. Two burgers and an order of fries to split seemed a bit steeper than I remembered. Even so, I still like the food, especially since they have malt vinegar freely available. Meaty burgers, not greasy ones, decent service and picking whatever toppings you want."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out after thinking about it for a while. I have to say we were pleasantly surprised. This is probably one of the better fast food burgers I've had in a while. Yes, the buns were generic, but it was awesome to eat a non-greasy fast food burger that didn't sit like a 10lb gut bomb. Hubby loved that mushrooms and jalapenos on the regular burger don't cost extra.

The mini burger (or whatever it is called) is 1 patty while the regular sized burger is 2. 1 patty was plenty for both me and the hubby. The fry portions are GENEROUS. We went to order a large fry and the cashier taking our order kindly informed us that a large was sized to feed 4-5 people. The small portion of fries was plenty for the two of us. They were served in a brown paper bag and we doused them with malt vinegar and some extra salt. They were delicious and not too greasy.

Prices are pretty reasonable- 2 mini (but sufficient) burgers, and an order of fries was about $12 after tax. With drinks or larger burgers that price would have gone up, but that's the case anywhere that doesn't do \"meal deals\".

Word to the allergic- peanuts are served at the door and kept in open boxes at the front of the restaurant. I didn't see any signs warning about this before you go into the restaurant, which was a bit disappointing since peanut allergies can be so severe."}
{"text":"Healthy and tasty food! For fast food, Five Guys seems on the healthier side which I like! I definitely didn't feel the grease overwhelm me as I do feel with some types of fast food sometimes. I got the Little Hamburger, which was just right for me in terms of portions. I got typical toppings of tomatoes, pickles, and lettuce, and I found it nice that there were several options for customization. Complimentary peanuts were a plus, and I had a great time snacking on peanuts while waiting for my burger! A good experience overall!"}
{"text":"I truly cannot speak any higher about this location. I typically visit during the workweek for lunch and my experience has been nothing less than stellar. The entire team always greets me with a smile and the manager William is extremely friendly and kind. He's the type of person that you could talk to for hours about anything. He always thanks me for choosing their location and shakes my hand. This location is the ultimate Five Guys location; not only for 5-Star service, but for how well-kept the location is and for having two Coca-Cola Freestyle machines. I've never had a bad experience here and I doubt I ever will."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've been told to come here by multiple people including friends from back home in Oregon. I love that not every burger is the same and they make it for you the way you want it. The fries they have there are also very good and this place is defiantly worth stopping by."}

{"text":"I love the staff at this location. They always make me feel welcome, the night shift all know me when I walk in the door. I wish they wore name tags so I could compliment them individually, but they all play a part in making this my go to burger in las Vegas. Thank you Five Guys (and girls!)"}
{"text":"This burger tastes like REAL DEAL.AAA
Nice customer service.
Always smiling .
Free peanut.
Huge fries AAA."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB!
I could eat there everyday and not get tired of their food, the best burgers and fries ever.. Not alot of other choices than burgers but that's what Five Guys is all about! 
The place was clean, the service was wonderful.
I had the double burger with Cajun fries, they give you alot of the price and there are tons of different soda choices too you can be Sir Mix alot and make your own creation with your drink!"}
{"text":"Move over Harveys and South St. Burger and Co., step down from your pews Burger's Priest! There's a new premium burger joint in town and it sounds like a gangbang from an adult film in days' past.  

I have no idea what the titular Five Guys name comes from, there aren't five guys working in this place, they have actual female staff so it's not misogynistic in nature.

What I do know is that they do good burgers! The kind that stays with you long after you have devoured it, the kind that makes you think about it at night on what you are going to have for lunch!

Upon walking in to any Five Guys burger joint you immediately sense that you have stepped back in time with the red and shiny white decor, reminding you of the 1950s when these burger and shake joints existed and were a popular to hang out in.  The cashier greets you with an enthusiastic welcome and the staff at the back even acknowledges you by calling out to the cashier that you are there if the cashier themselves aren't there to greet you.  Now that is attentive service!

The selections here are simple:  little burger, little cheeseburger, little bacon burger, little bacon and cheeseburger.  By little they mean single beef patties, and you can get a \"regular\" of all these aforementioned burgers, which means they make it a double patty.  The prices reflects that too with the most expensive burger on the menu topping out at $8.99 for a regular bacon cheeseburger with two patties.

You have a wide choice of toppings to add which are listed on the bright legible menu right above the cashier's head.  All the popular toppings that makes a burger are all there, alongside with some more premium toppings such as grilled mushrooms or grilled onions, even BBQ and hot sauces are there. It should more than satisfy your burger's needs. Nothing exotic here though unlike the other burger joint that serves NY Fries... ;)

There are also two types of fries, a regular fries and cajun fries which I believe is just a dry spicy rub.  Peanut allergy sufferers take note, they use 100% corn oil for their burgers and fries so you are safe but - they also offer free self-serve roasted peanuts for you to munch on while waiting on the side.

Upon ordering your burger, you are given an order number at the end of the kitchen counter in which to wait to pick up your burger.  Side note: I once got order #66 and immediately thought of the massacre of the Jedi.. (geeky reference, disregard if you do not get what this means.)

While you are waiting, you'll notice the absence of trays at the tables, and that's because they do not use any.  I think they meant this place to be a take out joint only hence the absence of trays, but not only that, it keeps the overhead costs down and the staff do not have to walk about wiping and collecting trays filled with burger grease.  

Anyway, after 5-7 minutes or so, your burger is unceremoniously announced that its ready to picked up in a warm brown bag.  They encourage you not to close the bag  as the hot burgers and fries on the inside will get soggy.  

The thickness of the burger itself depends on what you ordered as toppings, but for good measure, try not to load up on sauces as it will create a soggy bun top and bottom! I myself will do a bacon burger of which they are generous on the bacon, with ketchup, mustard, lettuce, grilled onions and mushrooms,  and pickles.  The classic sans tomatoes!  I also love that the ketchup counter features plastic Dixie cups with lids so you can save your ketchup later for take out - none of that messy difficult to rip ketchup packs here!

On first bite into the burger, you'll find that the beef patty is juicy and succulent, cooked medium rare to medium well as to lock all of the juices on the inside. The texture of the patty is magnificent, one that severely lacks at Harveys these days especially now they have have removed their popular ultra burgers from before.   It's thick and tastes like what a burger should be, not the liquid meaty mush that some burger joints try to pass off as fresh meat.  A beef patty should not fall apart in my hands as I chow down!  Everything is cooked perfectly together - savor the meaty beef juices as it drips onto your hand, mmm finger licking good!  

This almost, almost justifies the higher priced they ask for in a burger like this.  I suppose the size is enough for an average person, but for myself I think it could be slightly bigger. But then again, I'm a bit of a glutton, I just love my burgers done right!

The fries are alright, nothing revolutionary or different - definitely try the cajun fries.  

The drinks dispenser are self serve so help yourself to a refill.  The staff will also periodically walk in and about the restaurant when its' not busy to make sure their diners are satisfied and make small talk with you to make sure your burger is to your liking.  

A definite try if you already have not! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This review is based solely as being a fast food joint. It's great for fast food. The meat is good quality in comparison to to other fast food outlets. It's more expensive but you get what you pay for in this case.

The burgers are good and can be customised. I like that you can get a low carb burger like in-n-out (they taste better @ 5 G). One comment would be the buns. They taste a bit sweet to me and can get soggy quickly, but that also has something to do w wrapping them in foil instead of paper which would be the way to go. If you like your fries crispy, ask for them well done.

The staff is outgoing and on the ball which can be a rarity in these parts."}
{"text":"I am always surprised that busy or slow, this place gives great service.  Always good, always fresh.  The tables stay clean, the staff is fast.  No one is ever just standing around.  They ran out of ketchup and the situation was handled within minute."}
{"text":"Great staff and decent burgers. Not thrilled with the soggy fries but the burgers are pretty good. Sloppy and fresh burgers, made with quality ingredients really hit the spot. 
I am the most impressed with the service. I brought in a group if 20 students and they were more than willing to work with us. Each kid was happy and full when they left. 
My only problem was the fries. 20 middle school students, 12 orders of fries, and there were about 8 orders of fries left over."}
{"text":"Its a solid 3 stars. Nothing special in my opinion. Burgers are cooked how you like and you can add on several items. Some are free, some are for a charge.
The fries are OK, but really greasy....I mean, I know it's fries, but it doesnt have to be SOOOOO greasy.
I think the burgers are OK, but it's kinda expensive......for burgers. I mean, not crazy expensive, but it's fast food and it's pricey for burger fast food.
Also, it can take a bit to get your order.
If you are craving a burger, and in the area, try it yourself. But there is an In N Out a block away."}
{"text":"OMGosh, heaven!  5 Guys is officially my favorite burger joint now.  Forget In n Out!  
Love the fries (regular, not cajun)....burgers are delish, flavorful and juicy.  
My only complaint is that the price is definitely higher than your usual fast food burger, but well worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Crappy food, over priced and rude service.  The only thing good was the free peanuts.  Won't return.  Mixed up my order and finally corrected after I had to prove with my receipt that it was done wrong.  Never stepping foot in here again."}
{"text":"Awesome food just make sure you don't get it to go. My car  smelled like greasy fries for days after I took some takeout home for dinner. If you really want a good burger, just stop by here and eat in, it's worth not having the greasy fry smell!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Five Guys locations that I have been to. Other Five Guys in the US are starting to be lighter on the toppings. At this location, they piled on the toppings, just like how Five Guys did it a few years ago. Therefore, if you are from the US and want your Five Guys fill, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG!!!.. The best burgers ever!... All you In&Out burger fans need to come check this place out, you won't ever go back!, love love love this place"}
{"text":"I'm a minority in my family when I say 5 guys is OK but I tried it again when it opened up close to my home. 

The likes:
Free peanuts -  I'd never buy a bag of peanuts at the grocery store and sit at home and shell them but for some reason that's a draw in a burger joint for me. 
Bag Fries - they purposefully give you bag fries (they have bag fries measuring bowls that they use to measure out the bag fries for each size of serving).  This means the sizing is completely irrelevant when looking at the packaging.   I think a large will feed like 4 people?!   There still is something about bag fries that make them the best - why is that still the same when half the order is bag fries?  I dunno.

The dislikes
For vegetarians,  they don't have a veggie burger per say.  The option is a grilled veggie sandwich with or without cheese.  
The cheese.   I love my cheese but this cheese is just too processed and melts into globs.   I find it required to hold my veggies together (no patties for me - boo) but I dislike any bite with lots of it. 

Overall I will go here sometimes.  I know it's amazing for many people and I like it better than say burger king but it's not nearing the tops of any of my lists."}
{"text":"4.5* 
Food is Amazing as with any 5 Guys, burgers made fresh to order, a bit expensive (basic burger is about $7) but worth it cause all the toppings are FREE!!! Fries are sold separately and are about $4, the atmosphere is good music is a bit loud. Playing mostly classic rock 5 guys channels the burger joints of the 70s and it works!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place is in business. I heard all the hype and we tried it last week for the first time. Well, it will be our last time. It was so over priced! for 2 burgers, drinks and fries it was almost $25! They didn't even get my order right. They seem like a wanna be In-N-Out Burger. I don't know what the hype is about this place   but the West Coast knows not good but great burgers and I don't see this place cutting it for much longer. 
I don't even recommend giving it a try just go across the street to In-N-Out where you will get great tasting fresh food on the cheap!"}
{"text":"The fries are great they give you a ton. The burgers are alright, I like that they give you the topping at no extra charge, but they are pricey for a greasy burger joint. They are defiantly the place to go when you are hungry. If you are a tiny eater they are not you place. Free peanuts too."}
{"text":"My first time at the restaurant; I must say the staff was courteous, the restaurant was clean, and service was quick. I ordered a little burger and a little order of fries; the burger was loaded with the toppings I had requested and cook to perfection while my French fries were fresh and cook to perfection.
I rated this restaurant a four, as the taste wasn't as good as I had thought based on its presentation."}
{"text":"I agree with the majority of the Yelp reviews... I would give this place a solid 3 stars. With all of the burger joints to choose from in Las Vegas, I thought Five Guys was good but nothing to rave about.

I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger with two patties and my husband and I shared regular Cajun fries.  The great thing about this place is that toppings are free even grilled onions and mushrooms. We originally ordered the large fries but the cashier was nice enough to tell us that the large is meant for 3-4 people. Our number was called right away even though the place was packed. Service was efficient and the tables were cleared as soon as people left. 

The Bacon Cheeseburger was enormous! I actually ate half for lunch and half for dinner and was quite full. The cashier was right about advising us to order the regular size fries. The fries were tasty. My burger was really good as well but not spectacular. 

I didn't like the loudness of the place. All of the workers yelled out the orders and it was just distracting. I felt the need to eat in a rush because it was just too loud inside with the yelling and loud music.

I would definitely go here again but only if I'm in the area. I can't help but compare this place to In-n-Out and I would still choose In-n-Out over it."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst place I have ever been to in my life. I am a vegetarian, so naturally I ordered a veggie + cheese sandwich, minus the mushrooms and onions. After I paid $22 for 2 meals, a young girl in glasses called me up to the counter and said, \"are you sure you don't want the mushrooms and onions, because it will just be a cheese and pepper sandwich?\" I said, \"yes, I want a grilled cheese with peppers basically.\" She said ok and her and her VERY unprofessional (staring constantly) coworkers began to make my meal. When it arrived, it was freezing cold. Looked disgusting. It Wasn't grilled, obviously. I didn't even bother to have them remake it because I was so repulsed already by the behavior of everyone there I knew I would flip out. Needless to say, I let it be. I took 1 bite of it and nearly gagged. I asked my girlfriend if she would finish it. As she started to eat it, I heard one of the gentlemen Say, \"she ain't even eatin that sandwich.\" I knew it couldn't have been me they were talking about. Then i heard the little girl in glasses say, \"I told her it was just gonna be peppers and cheese, WOWWWWWWWWWWWW.\" The most long, and obnoxious wow. Long story short, I asked for the manager, she wasn't there. Got both the managers name and girl in glasses. I will be getting my money back. Hopefully they don't offer me free five guys for a year because I would decline in a second. The most unprofessional and dirty staff I've ever encountered. Wish I could rate a zero."}
{"text":"I eat here weekly.  At this pace I will be as big as five guys.

But I can't help it.  Big juicy burger double stacked, topped just the way I like it, and served with enough cajun fries for three guys, this place makes the food I like.  It's a man meal fit for a trucker.   

It'd take five guys just to keep me out of this joint."}
{"text":"I love the fact that the burgers taste homemade and that you can customize it to however you want with the toppings (which they don't charge you for...thank god cuz the burger is pretty pricey itself!).  The fries are pretty cheap considering the humongous amount that you get!!  I always have to get the little burger...which is a big burger for me!!  Definitely will satisfy your burger craving of the moment...but I won't be running back.  A slow walk maybe:)"}
{"text":"Have tried Five Guys in other locations around the country and was always pleased with their burgers.  NOT at this location though: the burgers were bland and very greasy (greasier than normal for Five Guys).  I compare to Smashburger in Las Vegas where the burgers are much tastier.  

May give them another try though, perhaps it was an off day with a substitute burger flipper guy."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in need of a burger fix, don't  go to the big 
Mc Wendy King common burger locations. Try instead Five Guys.
The burgers are made fresh and cooked to taste.the fries are real, not  the frozen bag to the frier style of soggy, greasy, hit or miss quality of some other places. The prices are great based on the quality of product.  This is still fast food, but done with some pride in the finished product. Good burgers, good value a \" GOT to DO Burger venue.
        Russ \" THE MAD HUNGARIAN\""}
{"text":"Food is super greasy which is probably why all the fat people keep giving this 5 stars and writing that it's the best burger joint in the city. Fries are below average. Even the cajun fries are below average. Holy Chuck is so much better. I've eaten at a lot of Five Guys in the US and those are not good either but they're still better than this one. I guess if i was fat and overweight and didn't care about anything else, I would love it here."}
{"text":"There's not much like Five Guys, which is good, because this kind of food will probably kill you in short order. But you'll go with a smile. 

The burgers: Delicious. Greasy, messy, the kind you need a bib for if you're on your lunch break. The toppings are good. The meat is juicy and fresh tasting. The buns are just right. What more could you want?  (Tip - The regular burgers are all doubles, so get the junior if you have a smaller appetite)

The fries: Fresh cut, cooked to order. You can get them with a seasoned salt dusting (kind of spicy) or without. You only need one order for 2 or 3 people. They give you a fry container, then toss even more in the bag. 

The staff was nice, the restaurant was clean and the service was quick. They have an order online option as well, and your food will be ready when you get there. 

I certainly recommend this place, but be careful not to get hooked!"}
{"text":"The FRIES...OH GAWD THE FRIES!

The fries are delicious. They are crispy on the outside but so soft in the middle. They remind me of giant in n out fries. 

The burgers are very good too but a bit pricey for me at $7 a piece. The toppings are free, but if you're like me you just like a classic cheeseburger it's not really worth it."}
{"text":"Great, friendly, fast service by the staff.  Clean restaurant.  Extremely reasonable prices.  As a vegetarian, I can vouch that the veggie sandwich with cheese is so satisfying.  It's basically just their bun, their cheese, and as many toppings as you want.  Loved it!  The Oreo milkshake was also fantastic next to the cajun fries."}
{"text":"Great location in the Epicentre that stays open late. The staff is always freindly and having a good time. Be prepared for plenty of drunks filling this place late on the weekend. A couple tips on the menu:

-Always order the small fries. The small serves 2.  Five guys always adds a half scoop of fries to go into the bag (they actually have a separate fry scoop in the kitchen for the bag fries)

-Go with the small burger, unless you are very hungry. Their small burger is a good size, especially if you are also ordering fries. 

With those tips in mind, my wife and I can have a great burger and fries for cheap and leave satisfied. 

I recommend the little bacon cheeseburger with onion and jalape√±os. Always go with the Cajun fries"}
{"text":"The portions are so large that I usually go with the small burger and small fry. Service is quick and friendly. Best burger I have had in Charlotte. Also, free peanuts while you wait."}
{"text":"Then again, I am THE pickiest eater on planet earth! 

This is a \"customize your burger\" place, which truly only consist of saut√©ed mushrooms, caramelized onions and jalape√±os. Not a fan of any of these so my burger was a plain cheeseburger, mustard, ketchup and BBQ sauce. The burger was ok. Nothing spectacular about the bun or meat patty. Fries were pretty good. I probably won't be back unless for some odd reason I feel spontaneous and ballsy. $10 for a Little Cheeseburger and fries..?? Nah!"}
{"text":"It's your typical burger joint, but with an eclectic flare. I would say it's pricey for the quality of food received, but you honestly are paying for the novelty of the peanuts and the setting itself. The staff are very curtious and helpful with topping choices etc. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Major con, in comparison to other GOOD burgers joints; TOO EXPENSIVE. 
The client√®le was pretty depressing, lot of white trash, saw a family of 4 in their pajamas. 
Music was way roo loud."}
{"text":"After visiting a number of other Five guys locations, this one seems pretty small.  I counted the chairs and there isn't seating for more than around 60 people.

The service was as I would expect from any Five Guys location.

As I recommend with any Five Guys location (even with the new Little Fry option)... an order of french fries will easily feed two or three people."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times. They have the new \"electronic\" Cola-Cola soda fountains so there is virtually an unlimited choice of flavored carbonated beverage options. One piece of advice I give all my friends when visiting ANY Five Guys location for the first time: one order of the small French fries will feed about 2-4 people.  You'll see why after your first visit."}
{"text":"This place is pretty tasty.  The menu is simple.  I ordered a little hamburger (it had one patty), the regular apparently is a 2-pattied burger.  They use fresh beef and you can watch them prepare your food.  They smush the ground meat and cook it well done (or so they say).  It's tasty, and worth trying."}
{"text":"Fresh burgers with a huge helping of toppings. It's very American. All of the burgers are made fresh, hand shaped and flipped. The menu is simple:

- Hamburger
- Cheeseburger
- Bacon burger
- Bacon cheeseburger

You can either get them in a regular size (gigantic) or small (sizable meal). Also available are veggie burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches. And of course fries which are hand cut and incredibly delicious.

This is the way that fast food hamburgers should be."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that this Five Guys opened here!

Five Guys is a great place to get a burger. The base is a delicious patty, spiced and cooked with good flavor, inside of a hamburger bun. From there, you can choose an array or toppings or none at all. Once you order, you wait until your number is called and you go get your food.

It can be pretty heavy, so it's not a frequent meal I partake it, but when I do I enjoy it very much so. The Cajun fry's are delicious. There is no reason to order anything other than a small. They give you a cup-full inside of the bag on top of your regular order."}
{"text":"Five guys gives a good burger! I think their meat is of good quality and their toppings are on par as well. The fries are also very good. I like them Cajun style. Plus, they give free peanuts - who doesn't like the free nuts that Five Guys offer? 

This particular location was good. The staff was nice and the food was good. The service was quick. The only down sides to this location is that, one, it is at Scottsdale mall (seriously - the clientele at the mall  seem to find it impossible to see past their own selfish aurora.) and two, the soda machine. They have one of the new, supposedly high-technology dispensers. Really, people can't seem to understand it and it takes 3 times as long waiting in line to get a drink as it would normally.

Otherwise, great place!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day for lunch with my guy. We were both (ok I was) a little hungover from going to a concert the night before nothing major or that a greasy lunch couldn't fix. We were walking down the road and came upon five guys and thought perfect! We went in and were greeted warmly and we were able to order right away. I ordered a regular cheese burger with some toppings and my guy got some huge double patty version of what I had and we shared the Cajun fries.... If you go ALWAYS get the Cajun fries there are probably the best part. The food was good it's pretty consistent here and while it gets the job done I don't feel like I'm wowed like most of my friends. Now this could be due largely in part to the fact that 2 people can't eat for less than about 25 bucks and that's with us sharing a large fry. I will throw some money away quicker than you can wink when it comes to food - however - it just seems kinda high for just a burger and fries.... The food is good don't get me wrong but the price tag makes it kinda not worth it to me although next time I'm an extra Jameson shot in from the night before out with friends I'm sure I'll be back with no complaints however sober and in my right mind I think my wallet will lead me else where for a simple burger and fries. All in all good though! 

We walked so didn't notice parking. There is outdoor seating and an easy walk from the light rail."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to this chain. I had the bacon cheeseburger. Staff were helpful and friendly, but the burger wasn't that great. 

It was a double patty and seemed to have a high moisture content as the bun got pretty soggy. The burger has two cheese slices which seemed like processed cheese rather than cheddar. The bacon was overdone (for my taste) and was very crunchy. All told just a hi hum burger experience at a pretty high price."}
{"text":"Got my burger but bad attitude server dumped fries over it that I had to dig for the burger. Terrible."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in In-N-Out, but I don;t get there often as they are only in the western US, I'm so glad Five guys open locations in Toronto and MTL, I can finally get a GREAT burger without having to fly to LA!  All fresh, made to order, worth the $$"}
{"text":"Crazy delicious! Tastes just like my grandma would make on her griddle, grilled onions and all. The fries are by far the best fast food fries I've ever had. You just can't beat them! We always get great service and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"very good Burger and fries. Burgers and fries made to order. they give you alotta fries! but its about 10-12 buck to get burger fries and drink. way better than any fast food burger including in and out. good stuff a must stop if you like burgers and fries! and its on mill so no free or easy parking on weekdays"}
{"text":"WOW!

i had no idea what the hype was about this place until one day i got off work early and saw a Five Guys on the way home from work. BOMBDIZZLE!

the fries are like a orgasm in my mouth. and they give you SOOO much! lol they give you almost a entire bag full to the brim of fries. burger was tasty and juicy, bacon was nice and crispy just the way i like it. i am defiantly a fan! its like a bother in n out burger just a lil different. but in a good way. they finally opened one up in central phoenix! check this joint out you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"The west coast has In N Out; & the east has five guys. It's pretty damn close to the quality and taste of In N Out. in comparison I would say that they have some of the best fries ive had at a fast food chain.

What caught my eyes first was that you can put ANYTHING on your hot dog or burger! My friend looked at me all weirded out that I got a hot dog with A1 sauce on it. Lol Everyone has there little special way of eating things and this is the place I can literally put anything on my burger. Big plus for five guys.

It does suck that it's only in the food court in fashion square. :/"}
{"text":"Always hot, fresh, and fun.  Has the new fangled Coke machine that can make anything Coke into a raspberry, lime, vanilla, diet Sprite.

Try the Cajun fries and get the burger \"all the way.\""}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and great service plus enough fries to feed an army! Sure, the price is a bit higher than most places but the only burgers in town that hold a candle to Five Guys are Culvers and Rumbi."}
{"text":"Came in and had a burger and fries. Burger was okay, nothing special. Fries had enough salt to de-ice my driveway after an ice storm. Couldn't taste anything but salt. 

First time and last time there."}
{"text":"This place is seriously over-rated.  The Zagat reviewers that called this one of the best burgers should be put into a rocket and shot into the sun.

It would be alright if you were looking for a cheap fast food burger, but the price implies it's much more.  The bacon cheeseburger is $6, fries are $5, drinks over $2.  The burger is over-cooked and a bit on the dry side.  They use some kind of runny goo they call \"cheese\" but is pretty nasty both in flavor and consistency.  I do have to say the ingredients like tomato, lettuce, and onions were fresh.  The bread is fresh but ultra-generic grocery store quality.  Low on flavor and just boring.

The fries are excellent, but for $5 they better be.  They are the thick soft style, so if you don't like that style, you won't like these.  I do like them and they were good, just not quite $5 good.  The burger disappointment really took the enjoyment out of the fries.

You'd be doing just as well by ordering the higher-end burgers at a chain fast food restaurant.  Or go to Culver's or In-N-Out for a higher-quality burger."}
{"text":"The girls and I enjoyed the burger and fries. My dad said the fries where the best as you can taste the potato instead of oil."}
{"text":"the customizable soda station gets 4 stars alone! But then I had my burger. Delish! The bun was toasted but also super soft which doesn't normally work but it was perfect! 
I'm not normally a big fan of fries, could take them or leave them, but Five Guy's fries are sooooooo very good!!!! 
I'd never heard of this place until the other day when I was in Phoenix with my boyfriend. He suggested it and so I said \"what the heck\". So glad I made that decision. Then I go on the website and find out they have locations in the Seattle area! This could be very good or very bad depending on how you look at it. 
One suggestion, if your appetite isn't very large, go with the Little Burger. My boyfriend has been here before and warned me ahead of time. It was very good size on its own so I'm glad I didnt go with the regular one. They also give you tons of toppings options at no extra charge. All in all, can't say anything bad about this place. They even have peanuts you can munch on until your order is up."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype about these burgers.  I think Wendy's or Burger King is just as good and neither of those places are my favorite.  I don't think it's any better than a fast food burger.   I'd rather have a B Spot burger or one on the grill at home."}
{"text":"I used to work here and I absolutely loved the food. I would always eat here as well and I love the hamburgers and frys. I recommend eating here :)"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. I love the service. The food is spot on. I usually get the single bacon burger with everything on it -how can anyone go wrong with bacon?!? Awesome management here. Definitely will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic crew working here, im a Postmates courier and they treated me to a free drink while I wait. Very good business ethics, fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, but a little too greasy.  Also takes a minute to get your food once you order it.  The sizes are nice for the price and the workers here were friendly."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. The only problem i have (unrelated to 5 guys) is the parking...wtf is going on? a) there is none. b) people can't drive. wake up, look around you, stop giving drivers licenses to sleeping women dammit!! annoying. ended up parking in the underground garage and having to go through some creepy hallway to get out to the Dragon Pearl side of the street. 

The burger was WOWZA. Meat is so pink and fresh, not frozen just soooooo amazing I was super impressed. 

Decorations - potato sacks. everywhere. tired of standing? sit on a sack. hicks all around unite. 

There are no combos. For a large drink (2.39) a bacon cheeseburger (double patty, 8.99) and a reg fries (3.99) came over $17. Pretty expensive for a burger lunch but so worth it. Trust story. 

GET THE CAJUN FRIES!!! They're muuuch much better than regular. However, 5 guys do know how to do it right. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, absolutely delicious.

TOPPINGS ARE FREE. What? Free. That's right. They have A1 sauce, mayo, lettuce, mushroom, onions, jalapenos - you name it. put everything on it! Warning though, your burger is going to fall apart. 

The cheese is something else...it was the best cheese I've ever had on a burger (aside from the gorgonzola at Big Smoke). Bacon was PLENTY too. 

Eat free peanuts while you wait :) Free refills! Free peanuts! Free toppings! Free smiles! Did I mention it's free? Cuz it's not...hello, you're paying $17 for a double cheeseburger meal. I would do it again and again and again until they banned my insatiable ass."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries (the fries in themselves could make a full order of food) and excellent service from a friendly staff. Only disadvantage is the price is a bit high--you can get two meals at In-N-Out for not much more than the price of one meal here. Still, a worthwhile place to seek out and enjoy an excellent burger."}
{"text":"The buns were pasty and not toasted enough and the meat was overcooked and dry.  Just a notch above Carl's Jr."}
{"text":"While I was in Japan for 4 months, there were two things I really really craved. Eastern-Carolina BBQ and Five Guys Famous Burgers and Fries. Yeah, not just a burger-- FIVE GUYS. 

The peanuts. The grease. The fries. Oh yeah, and The burger. It's all amazing. If you haven't been yet, you're really missing out. It's just a classic, American burger-- perfected. Also, they're made to order! 

The fries are always freshly (?) fried! So they come out nice and hot! I love the texture too. Not a fan of the hard, crunchy fries. 

Pro tip: The portions are usually big! A regular is a double burger and a normal fry is usually enough for two people. 

However, I did notice at this location they seemed to give less fries than other locations I've been to."}
{"text":"What can you say about the food here other than it's amazing?!?!?

The burgers are delicious, the fries are always perfect and you know they're fresh and the multiple drink fountain is pretty awesome too. 

The staff here is always on point and friendly. I wish they had a different cleaner as it can be slippery and/or sticky at times. Overall, I enjoy coming here for a good burger."}
{"text":"I am a huge burger fan and have sampled burgers in the US and the UK.

Five Guys is definitely one of my favorite burgers. Fresh and juicy, their burger tastes like it was made in someone's backyard in the best possible way. Their fries don't have that manufactured french fry taste...you can still taste the potato in their fries, which I love. 

I also love that this Five Guys location has the awesome soda selector where I can still enjoy Vanilla Coke."}
{"text":"True love. 

I can eat an entire regular burger with the works. (2 patties) and I still look damn good in a bikini. 

Little burgers are for wusses. ;-) ((enter sarcasm))"}
{"text":"So how can you get excited about a place that sells hamburgers?  Billions have been made selling hamburgers to the American public, so what could make a burger restaurant special?  Try a quality product, fresh ingredients and good service.  I have been to Inn n Out Burger and thought they had it right.  This experience far exceeds what they provide.  Take a generous piece of quality meat, cook it well and add a variety of quality toppings and add fresh fries and you have a first rate product.  I suggest getting the small sized burgers unless you have a large appetite.  For those of you who are health conscious, the burgers are as healthy as I have found.  The sodium content is as low as I have found and you can add whatever topping you want to, keeping it healthy.  The fries are unsalted, and you can add as much or as little as you want.  While I find it difficult to give a burger restaurant four stars, this one is exceptional.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really like the quality and value of Five Guys Burgers.  i was surprised to see a location open in Steelyard.  This location is up to the high standards set by other locations I have visited.  Friendly service, quality products.  I was able to preorder using the Five Guys iPhone app and picked up my order.  One warning, the fries are HUGE!  A standard order will easily feed two.  My kids love the soda dispensers, which are programmed to dispense many different flavors and types of soda.  They also have a similar ice tea dispenser.  New location, clean, and great service.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I am a huge Five Guys fan.  I love the quality of their burgers, toppings and fries and their custom ordering.  We were driving through the area and wanted to stop for a brief meal.  At first, I was turned off when I found out it was in the mall, figuring it was in the food court.  While in South Park Mall, it is completely accessible from outside the mall.  It even has limited parking for pickup.  There is outside seating as well.   Service was fast and friendly, and the online ordering worked like a charm.  Good choice to stop for good burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Wow. How this place has declined. Food is decent, but service has declined.  Last two times the orders were incorrect.  Also, the floor is always incredibly slippery.  I am disappointed because I do enjoy the burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I had to try this place because of all the hype!  I'm a fan of  In-n-Out but I've never cared much for their fries.  I heard awesome things about Five Guys fries so I went with the Cajun seasoning.  I was not a fan.  To me it was too much and I will try them plain next time.  They do give you more then enough for two people though.  The burger was a basic, good burger and I like that I can customize it.  I think their prices are a little high and I prefer the combo option at In-n-Out and a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Good service and a hot burger. The workers were friendly and attentive. The burger was pretty good but the fries were delicious! I will be going back. It is a tad costly though."}
{"text":"Second time trying Five Guys since they opened, and I don't see myself going back anytime soon.  It's not that the burger or the fries aren't  good and I appreciate all the toppings offered but for the price I'd rather have a restaurant burger in a more enjoyable atmosphere.  The couple in front of  me with their toddler rung up at $30.  It's just overpriced for a fast food burger in my opinion."}
{"text":"The burger, good.. The line, way long.  The fries.... OMG, way too much!  The fries probably had 2x the calories of the burger!  On top of that unlimited peanuts.  It's crazy!  But I ate it all.  Gobble gobble down the pipe."}
{"text":"Cajun fries with vinegar (dont judge me!!): GOOD!
Burger with everything (including grilled mushrooms and onions) plus A-1 sauce: GOOD!
Very nice staff: GREAT
High tech soda machines: AWESOME!
People that compare to in & out: boo! Of course it's a bit more here...but I think it's worth it.. Or maybe I'm just not an In & Out fan, sorry.

I guess I only review places I really really like. FYI the \"little\" burgers are a single patty while the regular burgers are double... I didn't know that but the guy at the counter offered this info."}
{"text":"Okay - I have been back three times since the first week, when the fries were less than extraordinary.

Every time, since that first visit, the fries have gotten better and better.

Moving it up to the 5 star rating it didn't get after the first week's visit.

...and the location is GREAT! 

Thank you 5 Guys."}
{"text":"C'√©tait bon, mais vraiment gras. Oui c'est de la mal bouffe √† la base, mais ya gras et GRAS. L'attente √©tait un peu longue pour des hamburgers et des frites. Le prix est un peu √©lev√© pour le genre de bouffe. L'exp√©rience en soi n'est pas d√©sastreuse, mais je vais y repenser pour une prochaine fois, √† moins que je veux me taper une bonne crise de foie."}
{"text":"Extremely cavalier about throwing the word \"n!gga\" around. When telling the manager words like that shouldn't be used between him and his employees he was argumentative. Extremely disappointed that we as Americans are becoming more accepting of non-customer service oriented management, and arrogant defensive young people who listen far less than they speak. 
Hopefully, true management will speak with these three young Latino men and let them know what is and is not acceptable in the service industry."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try after hearing that it is better than its competitors. The burger was good and I enjoyed the toppings. The cajun fries were good and they gave you too much. I split a large with my wife and we dint even get to the up they come in. They had ticket he amount in the bag. I would go back but it is not my first choice"}
{"text":"When entering you have to figure out the way to front counter. I watched several people walk around due to how compact everything is here. The food is just as consistent with any other location and that was a plus. The tables are right on top of each other making it an uncomfortable dining experience. There is the smallest aisle to get to the front if you need to use the restroom, refill your drink or pick up your food. I also feel this place to be dirty. It is. Mom on to find peanut shells all over at Five Guys. The fountain drink area was a mess and there was ketchup and plent of other debris on the floor. This would be a place I would go for take out but wouldn't want to eat here again,"}
{"text":"Hand-made burgers that are really good. The fries were perfect and HUGE! Two orders was a full bag. This was enough for a family of more than five."}
{"text":"Having never eaten at a Five Guys before, my husband and I decided to give it a try.  We both had the little bacon cheeseburger, regular fries (shared) and drink.  My husband thought it was the best burger he had eaten in a long time, due in part to the crispy bacon and mushrooms as toppings.  The fries were hot and plenty for the two of us.  I was most impressed with the friendliness of all the employees and the cleanliness of the dining area.  We will be back."}
{"text":"First time here, Its like in n out but WAY better. Im so glad they give you options like jalape√±os on the burger so yum... And the portions are huge. From now on Screw in n out."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(199/365) \"LaWanda And The Gang!\"

We've been hearing mixed things about Five Guys and here's my take...

Service: LaWanda gave us stellar service from start to finish after hearing that it was our first time. Burger prices, burger breakdown, and ENDLESS TOPPINGS AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE!?!? COOL!

Peanuts: Who else gives you AYCE Peanuts waiting for your order, and after you finish your meal if you have room? Five Guys does!

Fries: Freshly made, Potatoes come from different states, and this day, the fries were made from potatoes out of Idaho...

Freestyle Coke Machine: Coke products...endless combinations...nuff' said!

Great meal, Great prices, and its as if we were watching \"Good Burger\" in real life with LaWanda and the rest of the crew, just enjoying serving customers always with a smile.

ALOHA!!!

{"text":"The burgers and fries are great!  Expensive but worth it once a month.  I prefer to take my order to go as the restaurant is is not as clean as it should be.  Tables and floor are dirty."}
{"text":"My first time to any Five Guys Burgers and I love it! Service was top notch and the food was oh so delicious! 

First off I'm not a big burger eater just because the meat always seems bland or dry when I get it at restaurants. Well, Five Guys know how to make a delicious burger. Fresh veggies, juicy burger, yummy fries and great service? What's not to like?? 

I got the mini cheeseburger and it was still a large burger. The cheese was perfectly melted, the tomatoes and lettuce were super fresh, the mushrooms were saut√©ed to perfection and the freshly fried French fries were an awesome side. 

I'm a big fan. Don't know why it took us so long to try one of these places out. We'll be back soon. For sure."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful great food and great service.  The service is actually fast for them making it to order.  The menu is not overwhelming such an easy a quick lunch while I'm at work"}
{"text":"The food is great unfortunately the service is horrible.  I went in three or four times the first few times I thought the bad attitude was because maybe the girl was tired from work.  The last time I went in was the end of the line for me.  I went in 15 minutes before closing and the girl was helping a customer and when she was done she yelled at we're closed,  so I said seriously you just helped that guy and you still have 15 min, she then yelled again we're closed get out.  So I yelled back fine you just lost a customer I'll just go to the one next to work from now on they treat me better.  As I walked out the door she yelled \" f**k you Bi**h \" when I tried to contact management I never heard anything back.  Great food does not give them the right to treat customers like crap"}
{"text":"Best fast food burgers hands down, but the service at this location is abysmal.  I ordered online, supposed to be ready at 5:30, but they made us wait until 6:20 before they gave us our order.  We saw our burgers just sitting there while they were helping other customers before us.  Then they forgot about us as we waited for them to do our fries.  We will never go back there again, which is such a shame bc it was one of our go tos."}
{"text":"Five Guys sticks to the basics. But Ohhhhhhh it taste so good. The atmosphere of this place is very welcoming. The staff was very friendly and answered all of my first timer questions. Ok now to the food. I ordered a cheese burger not knowing that the regular comes with 2 patties and the cajun fries. Let's start with the best fresh cut fries that I have ever tasted at a fast food establishment. They were freshly cut, seasoned to perfection, and about the size of human fingers. They serve them in a cup but don't stop there, then they throw the cup in a brown paper bag and toss another handfull of fries on top of that. AMAZING. Well worth the 3 dollars, and one order will definitely feed 2 full size adults. I ordered the hamburger with just about everything on it because I wanted to experience the gooey,sloopiness, of other burgers that cost about the same. I almost had trouble finishing the meal because it was that over the top. All of the toppings were free so they don't try to nickle and dime you. I paid 19 bucks for 2 burgers, one order of regular fries and 2 drinks. Give it a shot you want be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not bad considering this is American/British food. 

I had hot dog and cheeseburger. The bacon and fries are crispy. The bread is too small and it was soaked."}
{"text":"Its not as good as dedicated Burger joints like holy chucks or burgers priest, but it's better than hero Burger or any fast food joint.

The Burgers: Burgers are cooked well done, and are made to order. They have a plethora of toppings that can be added and though cooked well done, it's plenty juicy.

The fries: The fries are definitely a winner. Fresh cut fries, sourced from different potatoes week to week and come in plain or cajun. A small order is enough for 2,  as they give you a container of fries, and then dump a container of loose fries into the bag. Who doesn't love eating \"bag fries\"?! It's like a gift within a gift. 

All in all if I'm around Yonge and dundas and am in the mood for a burger, I opt for 5 guys over big smoke in Eaton centre."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Sraff is very very friendly.  Quick service! Atmosphere, burgers,  hot dog and  peanuts..a big hit with the family!"}
{"text":"Very good burger and fries.  If you've been to a Five Guys in the past you know what to expect.  This location is no different.  Sure beats the Burger Kings, McDonalds, and Wendys.  Seemed like the people working behind the counter were having a good time singing to some cheesy Rick Springfield music."}
{"text":"This is my sons weekend to go out to eat. He choose 5 guys and it was absolutely wonderful. If you have ready any if my reviews you would know I have a gluten allergy. The staff took extra precautions and assigned Ashley to the burger making task. She went to the back changed aprons and put on fresh gloves and made me a lettuce wrap. She even went to the back to get me utensils to avoid co contamination . John checked on me a few times to make sure I wasn't sick. No allergic reaction and great food. Thanks. Also my son ate his whole burger. Must have been good."}
{"text":"Having tried Five Guys on the East Coast (where they originated) and liking their Burgers, I was very excited at the new location, so close to home. 

My first experience was with Fried Onions only. Unfortunately, I believe the onions (which are NOT fried to order) gave the Burger a \"chemical taste.\" The fries have a nice taste but will order them well done in the future, in order to avoid the sogginess. 

Not dissuaded by a NOT GREAT experience, my next trip I tried the \"traditional\" lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise. Very little taste and the Burger, while large enough with two patties, seemed overwhelmed by the mayonnaise. Well done Fries were better than the first. 

\"Third time is the charm\" I thought. 

The acid test would be \"pickles and mustard.\" If the burger was good, it would stand up to this, as do Fudruckers and Steak and Shake. Alas, not to be! The Burgers flavor did not make it through the mustard. Unfortunate, but Five Guys will NOT be on my Burger list in the future."}
{"text":"An above average burger although a little over-priced. I expected a larger portion, but a good tasting burger. Hand cut fries are a rarity in this area and get well-deserved praise.

Service was better than average, considering the bad things that were relayed from other Foodies and Critics. Although during a small rush, it seemed like they did get overwhelmed. 

Peanuts are a nice touch and helps customers take their minds off the time it takes for the made-to-order burgers. 

3 1/2 Stars would be more accurate but nothing was exceptional so I rounded down."}
{"text":"This fast-food is now considered a classic. I go there when I wanna have a burger at lunch, with colleagues, as it's located in the financial district, next to my work. It's more expensive than McDonald's, ingredients are fresh and portions bigger; you can share your fries, I always pick the cajun style. And I order the little cheeseburger, with pickles, grilled onions & mushrooms, mayo, ketchup & mustard. The hamburger comes with two patties.
It's better to be there before noon if you wanna have seats, they also have a terrace during summer."}
{"text":"I rarely eat fast food, but when I do 
..I eat five guys...lol

Good food, good service,  blah blah blah."}
{"text":"Over priced, covered in grease, undercooked & soft, i knew better when i got the cheese burger after only 2-3 minutes of cooking but still ate 1/2 since i was so hungry and paid $8 for a greasy fast food burger. With in an hour my stomach hurt & i was sick for the next 24 hours. Tums, pepto & water couldnt help fix this terrible burger experience. Dont waste your money or your day by eating here."}
{"text":"Burgers is bland and tasteless, relies on toppings. So expensive. Hot dog is tiny and terribly salty. Fries are similar to Harveys, don't compare to New York Fries. Would not go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. In fact, I am going there right now. I'm dying for a little bc and a dog. I will eat them both at the same time. I can't wait for this. The burgers are absolutely delicious and I've never had a dog -- this is a special day for me. :)

I REALLY do not get these reviewers, who make a purchase and then bi**h about the price. Are they not capable of adding up the cost BEFORE they hand over money, post a photo of their tab and write \"smh\" (I have a strong aversion to that phrase. Who gives a sh if you are shaking your head? No one. Absolutely no one.)? If it is expensive, DON'T eat it. 

I rarely eat burgers, red meat or fast food, so a once in great while splurge on a bombass burger is worth every damn penny."}
{"text":"Glad they opened up one on my side of town.  Parking is a bit of a hassle though during peak hours, but worth it."}
{"text":"Everybody loves five Guys. The burger is perfect but I wanted pickles and they didn't give me any.  So that was the only downside to our experience.   I'll be back and order extra pickles."}
{"text":"Burgers were ok, but the prices were quite high.  For those prices I would have expected much higher quality/standards.
The prices are just slightly lower than a specialty burger joint.
The service is similar to a Wendy's.
The decor is below Wendy's standard and perhaps better than a dirty McD's or BK.  When I try to recall the place, the interior isn't appealing at all, bright white tiles. the loose square tables. Looks a bit more industrious, and less a cozy sit down, enjoy a burger and chat place."}
{"text":"I went there and waited 25 minutes for my food. Around the 15 minute mark they called my number and some dumbass went up there and claimed my food and then talked to them for like 5 minutes and it looked like something needed to be fixed or something. And they took the bag back and then never called my number. I sat there for another 10 minutes. Watched dumbass get their food and leave and then  they called the two numbers after me so I went up there and said where is my food. \"Oh it's right here\" I said how long had it been sitting there? \"Two minutes\". That was a lie. If you forget and mess up, don't lie. I like their food but will not visit this location again."}
{"text":"This is good stuff! I ordered a burger with almost everything, and I don't mean their definition of \"everything\", I mean almost every single topping  except mayonaise and BBQ sauce. 

The burger was absolutely delicious, but I'm probably biased because I'm a toppings whore when it comes to burgers. You might argue that I eat burgers simply to eat the toppings. So this place was clearly geared for me with their policy of not charging for as many toppings as you want. We also ordered some fries. We tried both the cajun, and the non cajun versions, and I wasn't really excited about the cajun version.  The regular fries were cooked well, and delicious though. 

The star of the show is probably their crazy drink machine. Maybe my yocal roots are showing through here, but I've never seen this before! They have a soda machine with about 20 choices for soda (coke, sprite, energy drinks, etc), EACH with up to 5 or 6 flavoring choices (strawberry, berry, etc). 

Next time I'm in Scottsdale, I'll certainly be going back :D"}
{"text":"The employees were okay except for one woman who was exceptional. We ordered a double cheese burger and a hot dog and they were all out of hot dog buns so they put it on a hamburger bun. The wait was unbelievably long with a pretty empty restaurant. My girlfriends burger was slopped together and she said the beef didn't taste right so she only ate a few bites. The next morning she wasn't feeling well and didn't eat becayse of her stomach ache. By late afternoon she was throwing up. We figured Her burger was the only thing to make her sick considering she hadn't eaten anything since.
Long story short skip out on five guys to avoid food poising and less than mediocre burgers."}
{"text":"Always the best French fries. Always. And I love that they have a veggie sandwich option now. Makes me more apt to come back often!"}
{"text":"I like coming to 5 guys, kinda pricey though. We ordered our burgers, fries and drinks.  When our order was ready, and as we opened our burgers we noticed there were 2 burger patties on each burger.  So I went to the front and asked if they made a mistake, oh no the guy said, the little burgers has 1 patty but the regular ones (the ones called hamburger, cheeseburger, etc) have 2 patties (and it costs $2.00 more).  I wish they would have explained this before we ordered, it was too much food for all of us.  Wasted money"}
{"text":"I have kept hearing about this place but was wary because some of the other burger transplants in the last few years have been mediocre in my opinion.  I had the little cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayonnaise and grilled onions and a little fries.  Really good, with one exception of there being to much salt on the fries.  If you want to sit outside make sure at least one of your party stays inside to hear your number called."}
{"text":"Best burgers on the planet. Staff is amazingly helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"It certainly is a different burger than that of In N Out. But whether Five Guys provides a better burger for it's price range is debatable. I'm still trying to figure out what the gleaming reivews here are for. One bite and like some have critized, reminded me of a burger from Wendy's. The burger has some pretty good heft and comes with a variety of options that come for free tho.

You get a pretty good portion of steak fries in a cup, I'd say enough for 2 in fact, but maybe managers should tell the high-schoolers to monitor their temps on the fryolator a wee bit better cause the huge deal breaker for me were the poor, limp, oily \"Cajun\" fries in a cup. Hell, maybe add a Sixth Guy. What good are the fries when they're soggy from the gate?

I would've liked a shake or some type of beverage exclusive only to Five Guys to wash down my food down aside from the usual fountain drink suspects. So maybe they were having a bad day on a slightly packed Thursday evening. I'm willing to give them another shot, they certainly didn't do any wrong but didn't knock my socks off either."}
{"text":"The music is so loud you couldn't hear people at your table talking without yelling. I know it's a burger place but it was a bit ridiculous that they were blaring Alice n chains music so loud.  There was no one else dining in the restaurant but it was still a long wait for a burger and fries. I've been to Five Guys before but never this location. I always enjoy their burgers.  The little cheeseburger is huge and more than enough food for me. The small fry is large enough to feed three people. Large portions and great food. I was so hungry I don't have any pictures to post !"}
{"text":"Wow!! So impressed. This location is VERY busy at lunch, but so well organized. The manager was greeting people at the door letting them know approximate wait times, another employee was holding the door. You can even eat free peanuts in line! I got a \"little\" cheeseburger\" and\"little\" fries. They were big and delicious. Lots of fun free toppings and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Absolute best burgers and fries I have ever had, great attention to detail, beats in n out by far"}
{"text":"This place hands down is the best fast food burger joint in Vegas. I like that the meat is 100% ground beef and the service is quick... Very unique condiments on the menu. Like mushrooms and jalape√±os... Or bbq sauce. This place is great!"}
{"text":"JUST PLAIN TERRIBLE! It took FOREVER to get our food.  The music is way too loud. You can't even have a conversation with a person that is sitting right across from you. Their food was okay but I have had a lot better at burger king even. Overall my experience was terrible. I do not recommend 5 guys."}
{"text":"I've been told having Five Guys is way better a fantasy than a reality and in this case, I have to disagree. It's taken me a few months to give in to the temptation of having one of those juicy double patty-bacon- cheese oozing all over the place- grilled jalapenos- saut√©ed onion burgers. I admit, it's taken me way too long to indulge and today was the day I took the grease soaked brown bag plunge.  There is no way that really good tasting burger was in any way good for me. I will note, I did have a diet coke and shared the fries.   I will be attending a back to back group exercise class tonight. There, see, all better."}
{"text":"This is place is great. I ate here for the first time and the food was some of the best burgers I've had in a while. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The prices are about average. You can order single or double burgers and the will give you more French Frits thank you can eat. The burgers are cool fresh with real ground beef. The fries are cut from local farms. They also have free topping for your burgers. There is a also have a children's menu for the little ones"}
{"text":"Finally had time to try 5 guys last night.

Walked in and right away I was acknowledged and the staff at the grill also let the other staff know.  I thought that was great!  The menu is simple yet confusing.  Brush up on your menu knowledge before you go.  It will make it that much easier for first timers.

I liked the decor with the boxes lined up and peanuts for the taking.  Clever!

My order was taken and ready within 5 minutes!  There were a few people eating, it was around 9PM which orders probably take a little long during peak times.

My burgers were delicious.  I got the large ones which must mean 2 patties (?) instead of a small burger which must mean 1 patty.  They were yummy none the less!

I am rating 4 because of 2 things:

-The regular fries were not very good.  Maybe the Cajun fries are better. 

-The chocolate shake was overpriced.  I had to try it and wont do that again.

But for a yummy burger this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"I know this is a burger joint, but their french fries are AWESOME!  I ordered the bacon cheese burger (I should have ordered the light - 1 patty instead of 2).  It was too much for me.  I again should have ordered the small fries not the normal size.  The soda machines are fun.  I had orange vanilla HC drink.  YUM...  I wanted to look through the machine to see what other options but I had someone behind me.  

Minus -1 star:  The seat hurt my butt or I need more meat on my butt.  LOL!"}
{"text":"They juicy burgers in my favorite mall....  What can't I love?  The seating area for five guys was a little dirty, so I sat in the food court.    FRIES!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh yummy juicy burgers and crispy fries...  I ordered the small for burger and fries...  LOTs of food."}
{"text":"We absolutely love going here prior to a Rattler's or D-Backs game!  Location is great, burgers are fresh,hot & yummy!!  A small order of fries is more than enough for 2 people to share...especially if you get the double patty burger.  Fries are cut fresh there.  We feel it's a great deal for the money!"}
{"text":"The burger and fries are both very good. I would have to say the food is way better than In N Out. I still prefer Smash Burger over 5 Guys though. My main complaint about 5 guys would be that they have to many tables smashed together which makes it very difficult to navigate the dining area. If you are handicapped in any way forget being able to get to a table without having to ask the other patrons to stand up from their meals and move out of the way. Even at that you would have to move the tables as well."}
{"text":"Tyrese was the most rudest person there . From the minute I tried to order he was giving me an attitude. I asked for my patty extra well and he purposely gave me a pink burger .  I asked for my fries extra crispy and he gave me cold fries . Like come on dude .! Him and his coworker some heavy girl were too busy talking to their friends who came to visit them ."}
{"text":"Five Guys....a fast food restaurant worth the trip!

I have been to more than one in different parts of the U.S. and their consistency is very strong.

The burgers....delicious.

The fries....great fresh cut style.

Fancy soda machine is cool.

Service....great every time I have been.

It is pricey....but you need to cut back on your fast food intake.  Plus every burger is fresh cooked....no pre-cook and microwave like the big M or King B.  

Save up and enjoy."}
{"text":"Very disappointing $20 for burger n fries n two shakes. Opportunities here but you need better food preparation. The cook was very enthusiastic but totally overgrillled our meat. The assembler was too slow and let our burger get cold go figure! And it wasn't crowded! Ultimately though there was something missing - too dry or not enough condiments etc. 

Fries n shakes were super but I came for the burger. 

Five Guys in Salt Lake City, Missoula, Kennewick were so much better."}
{"text":"I must give this place 5 stars

This is the best burger I have ever had in my life...

Ive never had such a good quality burger the meat is so juicy and flavorful, the bun just melts in your mouth and to top it off i had bacon mayo and cheese to enhance this flavorful juicylicous burger. I ordered a side of fries to go with it there also very tasty I love the seasoning on them and there very generous with the amount they give you. My son had a grilled cheese and fries he ate all of his food which is very rare i actually had a bite of the grilled cheese myself and i must say it was pretty darn tasty for just a grilled cheese.

I have no complaints about this place. How can you go wrong with good quality food, good friendly service at a decent price.

If you haven't tried this place please do it will be the most delicious burger you have ever had, ever since Ive been here Ive been craving and dreaming of their food."}
{"text":"I'll make this very simple---I love 5 guys!
I'm not the biggest fan of fast food, and I consider 5 guys to be somewhere in between. I enjoy that I get to watch the cooks make a real beef patty right in front of me. 
The Cajun fried are awesome. I enjoy that when I get a regular order I'm handed a brown paper sack filled with like 2 orders of fries. I can never eat them all, so I like to share.
Regular Burgers are 2 patties, so I tend to get a single. Once you load this baby up with mega toppings...who needs 2 patties? Right?

I think it's an art to make a decent burger, and when i can walk into this State St. location and get one any day of the week, I really am fond of that!

Five guys, your the best!"}
{"text":"Allergic to nuts? Sadly, you'll have to skip this place.  Roasted peanuts are available while you wait to order or when you wait for your food.  Bonus for me, but sad for those who can't come.  

Really good burgers and fries, but in enormous portions (think American platters) and quite pricey.  With kids, a family might blow a whole week's budget.  A little burger with fries comes to $10.03, before a drink.  They don't offer a combo discount.  So we do go here, but it's a treat for us.  Prices are lower in the U.S. locations, so disregard the reviews which show lower prices.

Keep in mind:
 Regular burger = 2 huge patties (cheeseburger is 840 calories)
 Little burger = 1 pattie (cheeseburger is 550 calories)

 Regular Fries (620 calories per 244gr) is enough for two, easily.  Also, the fries are cooked in peanut oil, which has 6gr saturated fat.

Their website lists all the nutritional info, so good on them.  I really appreciate it. 

I love that they list on a chalkboard where the potatoes come from (PEI)."}
{"text":"This chain beats in and out, smash burger or any others out there in my opinion. It's a messy, delicious and good price. Peanuts as an appetizer whilst you wait for 10 minutes and then get messy. Fries are scrumptious too, if you like a bit of spice go Cajun. Wish I'd had the milkshake."}
{"text":"Burger was nothing special. After all the hype I was looking forward to this. In-n-out burgers are tastier. I had the Cheeseburger here, and a few fries. Would prob not come back unless it was the only option I had."}
{"text":"Great food but the place is dirty dirty dirty! Cashier needs a smile and personality adjustment.  She is standing around when a quick sweep and wipe down of the tables and floor would change the review here. Normally 5 stars but this night it's a 3"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries, a step better than Mooyah. Also a step or two more expensive. You could eat at Culvers twice for the price of one meal at Five Guys. So that's my only complaint. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Just go here - simple as that. Best fast food burger in the country!!!!! Quality comes at a price - oh and the fries? Killer!"}
{"text":"Can't understand the low overall rating. These places have the hugest quality burgers and fries at anywhere near this price point. The fries are cut fresh and cooked in peanut oil as they should be. The burgers are fresh and hot off the flat top and the portions are enormous!
The personnel are always pleasant. Only fault I can find is that it needs a bit more a/c as the kitchen is open to the restaurant. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"First time I ever go eat here. Had seen a couple of these around the valley but until today got to try it.

It is everything I had heard and more. Great burger,  had the bacon cheese with saut√©ed mushrooms, onions, and jalape√±os. Absolutely fabulous. 

The Cajun fries were outstanding!!!  Got the small ones and was probably enough for two people!

Will definitely be hitting this place up a lot more often!"}
{"text":"Love it! From NYC and living in Montreal now. totally satisfied that taste the same as the five guys in queens! Yum!"}
{"text":"Five Guys is great!! The large fries are only good if you have someone to help you eat them, or maybe 2 people. The bacon cheeseburger is my recommendation. They also have one of the new fountain/coke machine that has the digital display and wider variety of drinks"}
{"text":"Five Guys!! One of the things I miss about living on the east coast, now all over Las Vegas. Go for the double bacon cheeseburger. You only live once. Also, the fries are served in large portions. A large fry can be split between 2-3 people. They also have all you can eat peanuts!! I like Five Guys, Smashburger, and Fatburger, or if you want Gourmet go with Bachi Burger on West Sahara. Five Guys is the most filling meal of the four, so come hungry!!"}
{"text":"This burger joint is grossly overrated and way too overpriced.  I initially wanted to order the bacon burger combo but they ran out of bacon.  So I opted for the hamburger combo and shelled out $14.00 for it.  The burger was mediocre at best and the Cajun fries were too soggy.  The peanuts tasted stale and were too salty."}
{"text":"Just tried Five Guys for the first time at Downtown Summerlin. The food was fantastic and the prices were very reasonable!  Can't wait to eat here again! You pay one price for your burger and all your toppings are included. The food is fresh and very filling!"}
{"text":"Good Burgers...... Fries were a little soggy and WAY to salty for me. VERY LOUD inside, music was too loud for a small space. Staff was very friendly and everything moved quickly & accurately. Loved the shake ! a little too pricey to be a regular stop for me."}
{"text":"Love it!  2patty burger cut in 1/2 is enough for 2people!  I've heard comments like \"its not flavorful meat\"----but, it's a TON of flavor! It's just all natural!  If u want GMO-burger-paste goto macdonalds.  Thank you 5guys...for good service, great burgers & fries!"}
{"text":"I went to Five Guys for lunch today and really enjoyed it. Very important to know hat the little burger has only one patty and just ordering a normal burger is a double. The portions for fries are also MASSIVE which is especially great if you're sharing.  The toppings are free and very yummy so be sure to load up on them. The ordering process wasn't amazing because the person taking mine was easily confused, but it was an overall very good meal. They also have free refills and complimentary peanuts."}
{"text":"Wow, this looks like a brand new restaurant... 

even though it has been open for a few years. When you enter, the entire restaurant is spotless. The stainless steel grille/firehood area sparkles. The floors are clean. The tables are clean. No food on the floor in front of, or behind the counter.

Sure, you want to know about the food and service. Answer: the food and service match the extreme clean of the facility. Cooked to order. Great choice of condiments.

A few things done well sure beats steamed, fast food. 

Just as good as when they first opened, Five Guys knows how to run a business.
Staff were outgoing and enthusiastic. 

Yes, the floors were being swept as I ate. Did I mention, \"clean?\" 

Go hungry: you won't leave hungry, I promise."}
{"text":"The tables and the floor can be made cleaner..food was good. I had a \"little burger\" which wasn't little at all ! There was lot of fries for the regular size."}
{"text":"I have say that I really like 5 Guys Burgers.  

I originally liked In-out burger as I lived in California for 5 years.  Then moved to South Jersey for the last 6 years.

I recently tried in-out burger it is not as good as 5 Guys.  The burgers are better and fries as well."}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to try the highly recommended Five Guys burger, and being a loyal, hardcore In N out fan myself.  Stopped by a small, discreet location in Phoenix, Arizona.  This location was tucked away from the main streets, right across the Starbucks.  The restaurant is very small (compared to the In N Out).  They also have large bags of free large, salted peanuts, similar to the type that is sold at any baseball park in America.  
Burgers and hot dogs are freshly grilled to order, on a hot, toasted bun.  French fries are stuffed in a brown paper lunch sack (I highly recommend sharing with a friend).  Burger taste, char boiled flavor, similar to Burger King.  Fresh ground chuck, more beef than In N Out.  The condiment area provides mustard, ketchup, and barbecue sauce.  Perhaps, the most intriguing item is their large selection of fountain drinks, 24 different soft drink!"}
{"text":"Our family used to eat at this Five Guys every Sunday after church. The burgers are good.
For this type of establishment they have added their tip, rent increase into the prices. There are no variations in the menu for example - do you want the small 4.00 fry or large fry? I walked out one day by myself and had spent 12.00 on lunch. I was like this is ridiculous and not worth the money.
Kids menu but is as just as high as the adults-
Finally after church one day I said we are not spending 48.00 for a family of 4 ( have 7 and 12 yr olds) to eat a greasy fried burger especially when the bun is bigger than the burger. We are having sandwiches at home. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Its a decent burger joint. Their offerings were very predictable and common. I mean nothing really spectacular or significant as far as food preparation, but they do offer a variety of different sauces and toppings. They also offer hot dogs too. I love their fries if you're into the cajun with slight sweetness taste to it. They suggest to mix malt vinegar and ketchup as a dipping sauce. I've tried it, and I fid it tasteful. So if your adventurous in trying new things I'd suggest to try that though the combination of cajun fries, malt vinegar, and ketchup can have a VERY STRONG taste. Cool thing also is you can eat peanuts that you pick from the barrel while waiting in line! The food is good, and safe. If you're not into being adventurous. I'd suggested for a mediocre place to go if you are looking for a quick bite without the McDonalds quality and vibe."}
{"text":"Now I remember why we haven't been here in over a year! Terrible service! $32 for 3 burgers, no fries, all condiments requested on burgers were missing, so we got 3 plain burgers for that outrageous price! We will never return!"}
{"text":"Burgers and fries are always good even if the price is a bit high.  Props to the gentleman working counter at this location.  Very friendly.  Will come back."}
{"text":"I saw this place written up in Consumer Reports about being a great burger chain and I saw it while in Pittsburgh so I decided to give it a try. 

I must say that I don't get the hype. The burger comes with grilled onions, ketchup, mustard, pickles, mayo, and I think something else. The thing is, you can't order it the way you want it. I tried to remove onions and mayo from the order and the cashier told me it was all or nothing. We \"negotiated\" a bit and I was finally get her to remove the mayo. Or so I thought. 

The burger I got had everything, including the mayo that I did not want, and was missing the ketchup that I did want. The burger was ok but nothing special. It lacked salt and pepper. The fries were horrible with a capital H. I don't care if they are \"fresh\" from Idaho (they have sacks sitting on the floor to show how fresh they are; kinda weird if you ask me). The fries were limp and greasy!!! I could not finish them. I ate a few and threw the rest away. A complete waste of $2.49 for a small. And my stomach was immediately queasy after eating. 

This place was popular, however, and I had to wait a while for my burger to be cooked. It is beyond me why. I guess either college students don't have good taste or I am out of touch with what passes for quality these days."}
{"text":"Came back here to use the free meal voucher I got after getting a meatless burger. Much to my surprise the voucher was actually good for TWO free meals. Even better, they totally remembered me. How great is this place?"}
{"text":"Ordered burger and grilled cheese. Fries and drink with both sandwiches. $26 ticket!!!!!  Not going there again."}
{"text":"Honestly for the price i pay every time i walk in to ANY of the five guys establishments i feel like i am being ripped off.   I am not cheap but i am not out to spend 10+ dollars if i don't feel like A. it will fill me up or B. it is too small and average for the price i am paying.  I understand things might be a little more customizable or \"fresh\" but if you want \"fresh\" for a Great price just go to in and out or my personal favorite favorite restaurant for burgers/sandwiches is four peaks their food is Good enough for me out here in Arizona. I was born and raised a northern Cali girl so i had it good as far as food goes and i miss it but i have to settle and find what i can out here if i don't end up moving back.  

Five guys is cool in my book that you can add stuff but i can add damn near whatever i want at four peaks and i don't feel ripped there.  Every penny is worth it in my book.  Five guys No. Only if there's nothing else close by i haven't tried or if i am too lazy and don't wanna be adventurous and i am starving out of my mind where i just need quick food. 
There is another problem with five guys and a reason i don't really go to them often is that there are too many excited people standing in line for this food that isn't mind blowing good for how tiny their burgers are i would rather go to a in and out and pay half the price and be happy with my recent purchase.

Like i said i have lived and traveled all over the world and don't find this place that amazing to wait longer than 10 minutes not including the line just to place your order. 

I will pass if i find other places close by which isn't difficult it is not like there's a five guys literally in the middle of the desert with no surrounding places to eat."}
{"text":"Burger wise... better than In and Out, Fatburger, and others.  But the fries are the very best in my opinion and I've tried nearly all fast food places.  These are the best.  The service at this location is fast and friendly.  If you haven't been to one of these places, you have to go.  At this location they have the NEW Coca Cola dispenser and it's cool.  Every imaginable flavor mixed right before your eyes."}
{"text":"This is another place I will be frequenting a lot.  If your a fan of a good greasy burger then this is the place for you.  The wait was not bad about five minutes.  You get to pick your toppings, plenty of choices.  They have peanuts in the shell to snack on, they were not bad.   The burger I had was cooked perfectly, little pink in the middle, the grilled onions were good, and I got bacon on it, cooked perfectly, the bun was steamed I think, its was also perfect.  The fries on the other hand got a thumbs down, they were soggy,  and not that great tasting.  But I'm judging this place strictly on the burger I had, and It was great."}
{"text":"awesome food! the service was pretty fast and the workers seem nice. not located in the best place but is clean and safe."}
{"text":"Really nice employees and great food! My boyfriend and I are great fans!! 

My boyfriend lost his credit card in this location and the wonderful employees kept is for him after 30 minutes of leaving. Of course they asked for an ID to prove his identity. Great location."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since this five guys first opened & it's always been consistently good! The burgers are always so fresh. I think the burgers taste even better if you eat it there. They are messy but, I don't mind. When you order fries, they over flow the cup & it spills into the bag. You get your money's worth. The employees are always so friendly!

It's no in n out but, it's the best place for a fast food burger in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Have dined at Five Guys several times, and have yet to have a bad meal. Had a double cheese burger with grilled mushrooms and bacon, another in the party had the kosher dog with all toppings, along with Cajun fries which were great!"}
{"text":"Overly hyped. Not really that good, but not too bad either. Very very long wait at lunch 40 minutes!

Pricing isn't bad and munching on peanuts while waiting really helped. The burger was definitely fresh and the ton of fries I got makes this place a solid lunch option."}
{"text":"Ugh!  Don't believe the hype. 

This place is awful and expensive.  Nearly $20 for a bacon cheeseburger, \"little\" (small) fries and a fountain drink.   

The cheese looks like processed Kraft singles and was cold. I know it's March but I shouldn't get tomato slices that are anemic pasty white. If that's all that's available then don't offer it. Wendy's posted a notice they wouldn't offer tomatoes a couple years ago.  Take a lesson. 

As for the burger.  It tasted like fried taco meat without any of the seasoning and was grey like dirty slushy snow.  Think of the Eddie Murphy skit (http://youtu.be/08c0BXTVpfs) about his mom trying to replicate a McDonalds hamburger and that's the nightmare that is Five Guys. 

My stomach is already hurting. Toilets beware!"}
{"text":"Laut Ex-Pr√§sident Obama die beste Burgerkette Americas. Die Burger sind wirklich gut, werden frisch zubereitet und just in time rausgegeben. 
Bei der Bestellung am Tresen sucht man sich, √§hnlich wie bei Subway, die Zutaten aus, die auf dem Burger sein sollen. Hierbei hat man eine wirklich gro√üe Auswahl an Bel√§gen. Fries m√ºssen extra bestellt werden. 

Die Zubereitung verl√§uft relativ fix und da die K√ºche offen ist, kann man den Damen und Herren vom Restaurantbereich dabei zu sehen.

Als Goodie kann man sich Erdn√ºsse for free nehmen und bis zum eigentlichen Essen knabbern.

Preislich bewegt sich der Burger um die 7 Dollar, was bei der F√ºlle der Bel√§ge vollkommen ok ist.

Der Service war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend und hat gut durch den Bestellvorgang geleitet. Das Restaurant war sauber und wurde w√§hrend unseres Besuchs mehrmals gereinigt.

Ob es jetzt die beste Burgerkette der USA ist, vermag ich nicht zu sagen, aber im Vergleich zum Habit Burger Grill, der sehr lecker ist, steht Five Guys denen in nichts nach.

Einfach mal selber testen! :-))"}
{"text":"If I were rating based solely on the staff, restaurant cleanliness and the taste of the food, this place would have 5 stars, however, I HAVE to dock points because when it comes to eating a burger, there NOTHING more infuriating than taking one bite and then trying to keep it together until the the entire thing inevitably falls apart in your hands. I did some research and found that this is a recurring theme with Five Guy burgers, which is really disappointing considering how delicious that one, good bite was. So, while I have nothing against this particular establishment, I can't help that mildly infuriating detail with the sub-par burger buns. 

Also, the fries in the bag thing may be cute and have that \"rustic\" sort of feel, but it's honestly just a confusing, messy hassle."}
{"text":"Good burgers but poor choice of bun means it gets completely saturated in grease, and soggy.  Not a good choice for take-out.  Bacon is not very good, very thin and broken up, clearly not a high quality product

Fries are great when cooked properly, but I've had some batches that are sadly underdone.

Only option for the fries is unfortunately ketchup, which I'm not a fan of - no gravy to be found. 

No chicken option for my incredibly picky little brother means we can't take the family."}
{"text":"I am a fan!

Love the new Coca-Cola fountain machines!"}
{"text":"This was my first five guys experience and it was awesome. I think the best part was the staff. They were so nice and professional and made me feel really welcomed. It made for an awesome atmosphere. The burger was really good too. You can tell they time and care preparing it. The burger does fall apart as you eat it but I think that is part of the experience."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place we could go to regularly and had heard good things. When looking at the menu, we lived that we weren't limited in the number of toppings- and I love toppings. 

The service was great- staff was very courteous and the restaurant was very clean. They also serve peanuts to those who are eating within the restaurant. 

The food was solid. We got an order of regular fries and an order of Cajun and the Cajun fries were great! The kick lasts a while so not recommended for folks who don't like more than a little bit of spice. The burgers were good but seemed to lack flavor. Not sure if maybe they weren't seasoned while on the grill? They were good and I would go there again just to see if there was a mishap. Worth trying."}
{"text":"Good burger. Like that they have grilled onions AND grilled mushrooms. Fries are SO much better than In N Out. Fresh cut and thick. Yum. No shakes though...."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype.  It's an alright burger, but I don't find anything incredibly special about it that warrants the price.  8 bucks for a cheeseburger and nothing else?

Fresh ingredients, and handcrafted patties are a nice change from your standard fast food. 

I swear I'm not an old lady, but the music is just so loud in there.  You'd think you're in a night club."}
{"text":"Come on people! Enjoy a good burger (and good fries!).  It seems to me that this place is being held to some kind of higher standard for some reason.  This is a fine burger, with plenty of options for fresh ingredients.  It's a soft bun, wrapped up to make a kind of melty-mash of burger goodness.   The fries are great fresh cut natural potatoes. - just the way I like 'em.

I would defiantly give 5 guys a try and find out for yourself. The times I've been there the staff has been friendly and quick. The food has been spot on.

One more thing: it's NOT cheap.  It's not going to keep me away from In-N-Out, but it's a nice once-in-a-while burger."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with the co-workers and I do have to say it was A-OK.  I got the little cheeseburger with ketchup, mustard, lettuce,pickles and mayo and it was very good.  Next time I will say 'light on the condiments' cause the bun got a little goey.  Reasonably priced at $4.19 - not bad!  

I go the regular-sized cajun fries ($2.59) and it is a ton of fries like the other reviews are saying HOWEVER.....maybe it was just the day I was there but my co-workers and I agreed the seasoning on the cajun fries tasted like something you pulled out of the back of your pantry and expired when the first Bush was sayin 'read my lips'.  It was gross.  Stale or something, just a weird flavor.  We couldnt eat them, the regular fries were MUCH better and I will always get them going forward.  If Penguin was within walking distance of uptown this place would be out of business in a week.  But lucky for them they are in uptown and A-OK!"}
{"text":"Five guys is always consistent, and you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  For me it's a double patty, with Mushrooms, grilled onions, chopped onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and ketchup.  Don't forget the fries."}
{"text":"The customer is NOT always right. Don't try to order your French fries the way you like it...  They'll tell you NO and let you know they only make French Fries one way!  Read it and weep people. I hate that the counter lady was so blunt about it. At least smile and tell me no next time... If there is a next time at this location. 

They have an amazing burger and they know it. Too bad the unfriendly customer service will prevent me from coming back because I really, really, really like their burgers but the juice isn't always worth the squeeze."}
{"text":"Great burger joint. Love the burgers here, they are cooked perfect, and have all the fixings I could ask for. Nice open layout with lots of seating and cool retro styling. Even the fries here are really good, try it with the gravy. Definitely not hating on this place, they make a mean burger, check it out. But just wont get the five stars from me, theres others places I still hold higher than these place! Love it though!!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and in the past I would have given it 5/5.  However, the last time we ate here we took the food to go.  It was quite a wait for our food (which I know they are cooking on the spot) but I would say 20+ min.  After we got home (5 min away) the food was just okay.  Nothing special.  Maybe it was just a fluke since our previous experiences were must better.  Love the fresh cut fries/malt vinegar!"}
{"text":"What happened to Five Guys? I have never eaten at the Downtown Summerlin location nor will I ever again. I have never had a bad burger at the W Flamingo store. I'll start with my Little hamburger. The bun was flat and hard and a bit overdone on the inside of the bun. The bun literally swallowed the meat. The meat was only covered by half the bun and my burger patty was as thin as paper on one side. Also the most dried up burger I've ever had! It was inedible. A good thing that I ordered a little fries or I would have left hungry. The fries were good as usual. So I'm not sure if it's just this location or they changed the way they cook and prepare the burgers but I'd give them negative stars if I could. I suppose if you're a kid then the burger may pass the test but I'd recommend staying away from this location. Also the tables were all filthy and I had to wipe my own table before sitting down. It was 8 pm or so but still they should have enough help to clean the tables."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Hate that the only portion of fries that they offer is made to be shared.  600 calorie per fries serving is crazy.   The five guys don't seem to think that a single person might eat out and want fries with a burger.

Update- They now offer three sizes of fries!  The small is still a huge portion but much better priced."}
{"text":"OMG this is a great burger. Better then In -N- Out. Everything is made fresh. This burger is just the right thickness. I not a huge fan of really thick burgers so this place works for me. The burgers are juicy and they have lots of toppings you can pile on. The 1 and only complaint is this is one of those places that tries to sell you fries separate. Of course they always say - our small order is enough for 2-. This bothers me cause when I go to a fast food type place I'm usually by myself and I need fries for one not fries for 2. Now your $5 burger turns into $10 when adding a drink and fries. So unless your someone that goes here to get a burger and a burger only you will never spend just $5 here. The sad thing is all the fries they are waisting when your forcing one Person to by enough fries for 2. Aside from that the burger is great but unfortunately for $10 burgers these days i can go to so many places like fez and or grinders. This place needs a combo meal for around $7 and I would stop here more often."}
{"text":"Bacon Cheeseburger All the Way with an Orange Coke.  Forget the fries, they leave you less room for the 2nd burger and more Orange Coke.  I love the open kitchen style and the potato sacks that form a route to the cashier."}
{"text":"Food
Burgers were tasty but the Cajun fries were really overly seasoned. Way too much.


Dine-In Experience 
Had to eat with jacket on and fast so food didn't get cold, -17 degrees outside but no heat on in the place. Made it really uncomfortable to dine in.
Tables also don't get cleaned very quickly."}
{"text":"Yummy Bacon Cheeseburger. I'll go back next time I am in Arizona, or if they open one in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  I'm really unsure what all the fuss is about with Five Guys.  I've eaten here and at other locations on a few occasions and I don't taste what makes this burger any better than the countless other offerings out there.  Both burgers and fries are very average.

The service has always been great and the place is clean and comfortable.  But my issue is simply that there is nothing that makes me say \"Let's go to Five Guys\" when we want burgers."}
{"text":"The best burger joint in ahwatukee(Phoenix),Az. Great burger & fries, and for the price. Its a win-win!"}
{"text":"My favourite burger. Perfect combination of fresh ingredients and melty cheese."}
{"text":"Was really excited to come here and unfortunately they're out of pickles and my favorite soda :(

They loaded us up on French fries (burying our burgers at the bottom of the bag) so we were happy about that, sort of.

Will probably update my review next time I visit, I'm sure it will be better."}
{"text":"I just had a great experience here and it has very little to do with the food. The cook in the back was extremely friendly, he made sure that my fries were piping hot, any custom built my burger with so much attention to detail. I wish I would've caught his name but he was an African-American gentleman and has he handed the order to me he said I made it with love. Much appreciated!!!"}
{"text":"This may be the most overrated burger joint in history number one they don't know how to cook burgers number to the fries are so overpriced its ridiculous number 3 the place is very plain and has no decor"}
{"text":"This place is always is solid.  I get the cheeseburger but you can add bacon.  The Cajun fries are legit.  You normally only need a small as they stuff a bunch extra in the bag."}
{"text":"This is the best Five Guys location in Charlotte. William, the manager, is amazing. He always greets every guest with a smile, and is always going above and beyond to make sure you have a good experience. The restaurant is always clean, and they always have a 100% or more health grade. All of the staff really pays attention to the quality of the food they are preparing, and it is always consistently fresh and made according to your order. My husband and I work in the area and end up eating here 2-3 days a week because the staff is so wonderful, and the restaurant is so much cleaner than your typical quick service. I highly recommend this Five Guys location to anyone."}
{"text":"Five guy's is some of the best burgers around.  There is nothing better than a fresh burger made to order.  The fries are also very good as they are made with fresh potato's.  My only complaint is this location can get very busy and you may have up to an hour wait before your eating your food.  I highly recommend this joint if your in the area."}
{"text":"I never understood the craze about In'N'Out but I can understand the craze about Five Guys - because they're better! That's right! 

And they have cajun fries. Far superior to tiny, dry west coast fries.

1. Five Guys  
2. In'N'Out.

End of story.

Sorry California."}
{"text":"First time to this chain.   Burger and fries were good.  On my okay to try again list."}
{"text":"Wasn't busy, burger was made to order and fresh but it tasted like it wasn't hot enough... Possibly due to extra fresh, extra cold lettuce and tomato? Definitely better than Johnny's around the corner and well worth the extra $."}
{"text":"I have discovered a problem with Five Guys Burgers and Fries...

Today my wife was driving, so she got to choose where we, and our two daughters went to eat. We all individually chose the toppings we wanted on our hamburgers. For a seven year old, that's an awesome moment. By the time I made my order, I already had some peanuts to eat.

The food at Five Guys Burgers and Fries is always top notch in my opinion.

My problem... after eating here, I had to go to work. What I wanted to do was take a nap. The portions are that good. The french fries were a bit greasier than I am used to from Five Guys. The service for this location was so-so for Five Guys. But that's still better than most."}
{"text":"California:

Las Vegas:
West Lake Mead Blvd...

And now I have visited Five Guys Burgers on Maryland Parkway, also in Las Vegas.
And now I am finally a little disappointed by a visit to Five Guys.

The food is always great. But the bacon cheeseburger that I ordered, turned out to be a double cheeseburger. Good for me, but did someone else order the burger I received? I took my order to work and ate it there... if I received was someone else's.... 

The service was disappointing."}
{"text":"Thank you for satisying my wife!

I often tell my wife \"Stick With Me, We'll find god places to eat.\"

In my first review of Five Guys (The one in Salinas, California) I made mention of how much my wife liked going. (This was her first time) I lived in Northern Virginia from 1980 - 2005 so Five Guys, I am very familiar with them.

On Thursday, October 23, 2015 my wife and I were running errrands and it was around lunchtime so I asked my wife the following:
\"Wife\", I said \"What would you like for lunch.\"
without missing a beat she replied, \"I want to eat Five Guys\".

She had her heart set on their cajun style french fries.
She also loves how she can order whatever she wants on her burger.

Me I just plain love the food.

This store in Las Vegas however, very noticably, had the best service. Greeted mere moments as we walked inside. Greeted again at the counter. Someone cleaning the dining room asked how things were. 

On the walls of the dining room, are pictures of older magazine articles about Five Guys. Being from Alexandria, Virginia I wanted to look and check them out. I was near the front counter looking at one when the same person who greeted and took our order asked me \"Are you ordering more?\"

I replied no, I am from Alexandria and actually has been to some of the original stores. I actually heard one of the cooks say \"wow.\"

Great food and great service, thank you Five Guys."}
{"text":"Had a Five Guys open up and wanted to try it out (to see what the fuss is all about).

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with cajun fries. The burger was overly oily in my opinion but had a good taste to it.

The real shocker was the amount of fries you receive with your order. There were TONS in just the regular size order. They were too undercooked in my opinion, but the spices were good.

Now that I've given it a shot, I'm not sure I'd go back unless I was in a bind or SUPER hungry..."}
{"text":"There's nothing funny about going to an establishment that serves food and not being able to be served, especially when the sign says open- let's just start there. Not only did the sign say open, but the actual time agreed with the signage as well. Secondly, when the employees (literally all 3 of them that were working) don't respond/ignore your inquiries about ordering food, when the \"establishment\" is \"open\", what choice do you have as a consumer to question the service that said \"establishment\" offers? Not ok! But FIVE GUYS on Central Ave will know this when the reviews ends up in one of well respected publications here in Charlotte- just so happens that one of the journalist were with me on this occasion. Do better ppl. Hire better employees. At the very least, employees that can respond to a customers inquires and address customer service."}
{"text":"I am from the home of the original Five Guys burger joint in the Washington, DC area. Now they're all over the USA and I have never been to a Five Guys anywhere that was not the same burger and fries as I had the first time I ate one when I was in Junior High. It's always consistent and I think it's the best burger you can get for under $6 anywhere.

I love In N Out. I love Five Guys just a tiny bit more. 

2 different experiences (no peanuts to enjoy while you wait at In N Out and not as clean at Five Guys) and Five Guys costs more, but one order of fries and a burger might convert you if you already have a favorite burger joint."}
{"text":"If you like burgers then you have GOT to try Five Guys.  I love this place!  Burgers are fresh and hot, made to order and are so juicy and tender they practically melt in your mouth.  The fries are awesome and really taste like potatoes and not some processed packaging material!"}
{"text":"If u like fast fresh food this is the place. Great staff that listens to u and makes sure ur satisfied A++"}
{"text":"I was worried I wasn't going to like it as much as I love Brown Bag Burgers, well don't worry it was just as good. 

Basic, good burger, nothing crazy. 

Location is nice, right on the end of the plaza. 

Staff was friendly, food was quick, just a good overall experience."}
{"text":"Honestly, when I'm craving a good burger, I could care less how much fat is in it :) 
I was a Five Guys fan before they expanded to Westlake and North Olmsted, I would drive to Avon for the burgers because they are that good. I usually get the little burger because the one patty is enough for me, two is a little too much...but still good. I love the atmosphere of Five Guys, it's a true burger joint theme, with a modern twist. It could be the blaring rock music that is always on, but I still enjoy ever last bit of it. 
Plus, for some reason, every time I go in there, they compliment me or say something nice...I don't know if they have to do that, but I'd like to think that the Five Guys staff are genuinely friendly people :) 
So people if you're craving a good burger, try Five Guys!"}
{"text":"The employee with long dreads kept wiping his dirty gloves on his dirty apron. As much as I love the food here, i can't go back because of that."}
{"text":"awesome place and great GReAT service! Im not gonna talk about their burgers and hot dogs since everyone knows they are the best!!! Thanks FIVE GUYS"}
{"text":"After hearing good things about Five Guys,  we thought we'd finally try their burgers.   Wow!   We were not expecting them to be as pricey as what they were but we don't mind paying if the food is good!  We received our food in a bag for dine in.  When my husband started to reach into the bag,  we noticed the fries had been put in the bag but some excess was just thrown on top of everything in the bag.  The outside of the foil wrapping on the burger was greasy.   There was definitely no flavor to the burger,  thank god I asked for cheese & bacon.   The burger itself wasn't warm enough to melt the cheese that was on it.   Then the fries were very under cooked and so salty we couldn't stand to finish them.  The restaurant was soo cold inside & if the music wasn't loud enough, there's a kid working in there that had no problem singing the songs loud enough for all to hear.  Then just as we are about done eating, one of the girls came around sweeping the floors.   Gross!  You're sweeping dirt & peanut shells & stirring up god knows what at the table right next to where I'm eating.  Really?   You couldn't wait until we were done?   I definitely won't be going back there!!!!"}
{"text":"Been a while since I've been here, and upon my return, I found the same good quality burger that they are known for. This time around we tried the cajun fries and let me give you a hint, a regular order of fries is enough for 2 people, trust me.

Fries were good. At first glance, I thought I was in for a way too salty fry, these things are doused with the seasoning, but they weren't too salty at all, so whatever they sprinkle on these bad boys, it works.

Music still is a little on the loud side, kinda distracting but it's their vibe so just go with it and eat some beef, you'll not regret it"}
{"text":"Beef! And lots of it. That's what you get here when you order a burger. Glorious, tasty and fattening beef. It's worth it though. This place gives vegetarians nightmares. Note for the uninitiated: Order the \"little burger\" for the single patty - and this thing ain't so little, trust me. Ordering the 'hamburger\" will give you a double patty- a little misleading. 
Included burger toppings are more than the average burger shop, if not used a bit sparingly but you don't leave this place hungry...ever.

Cajun seasoning on the fries is a must if you like a little kick.  I put Five Guys above Smashburger in my book."}
{"text":"Very good burger for the price. Can't complain bout it being fresh and not frozen. Fresh cut fries as well. Plus you can smack on peanuts while you wait :)"}
{"text":"The staff here clearly doesn't understand English. I ordered a burger and they gave me the wrong order and my friend ordered his order as well and it was completely wrong. The employees here need to take their time and listen as well and turn the music down because clearly they can't hear a customer paying $15 for a burger and not getting what he paid for, it's bogus. Never coming here again and not recommending this location to any of my friends and family."}
{"text":"Great burger place. There is the in and out nearby but these guys win. Thee burgers are more diverse since you can get any topping you want and the meat just tastes better. Burgers are great Fries are delicious Drinks are cold"}
{"text":"Ok this place is incredible. It's what other hamburger restaurants wish they could be. Great food and wonderful service. It does cost just a bit more than most fast food places and worth every penny. I got mine with bacon and onion and cheese and oh wow!"}
{"text":"First of all: love love love the free peanuts! I always take some back to work with me to munch on throughout the day. I typically get the bacon cheeseburger (the one with 2 patties); very flavorful. I also like how they cook with peanut oil. 
Recently I tried their veggie sandwich.  It was good but I was a little surprised as they just threw a bunch of vegetables in between 2 buns. Maybe a vegetarian/vegan patty option would be nice?"}
{"text":"Great tasting burgers but the fries were soggy both times I tried them. Several people I know mentioned that this location makes better burgers than other five guys locations."}
{"text":"I've been trying all the new, expensive burger places and have to tell you..this place blows them way for a burger!!  Yes burgers blow your diet but if the mood strike make sure to give this place a try.  Get it loaded and enjoy the goodness.  Oh and the french fries are super fresh"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!!!! Best burgers in town!!!
Great fries too!!!! It's my first choice for a great fast food burger that tastes more like a gourmet burger!!!"}
{"text":"Decent burger made with - get this - real hamburger meat!!! Wow, what a revelation people. I had it with tomato, lettuce, hot peppers and I forget what else but it was really good. I didn't order fries but my hub did and they gave us enough for an army. They were pretty darn good also. I kind of wish they had a turkey or chicken burger on the menu. I'll go back."}
{"text":"I was craving a decent burger for quite some time and I thought while I was NC, what the heck. Burgers are made to order and appear to be hand made. The rolls are fresh and all the fixins you could want on a hamburger are there. The fries are hand cut are pretty decent if you can get them while they are hot...and there is a lot of em! If I'm ever in the area again, I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Good burger place. I stop here everyone once in a while.   Reminds me of burgers that you would make yourself.  But the best part is that you don't have to make it.   It's not fancy just basic goodness.  Pick your own toppings and you can have as Ann as you want.   

Burgers have good flavor and feel that you get a lot for your money.  If you get fries, be aware that they also give you a scoop for the bag.  Don't know why but that's just the way they do it.  

Also they have free peanuts to eat while you wait.  Again just a cool thing.   I frequent occasionally and the quality is usually there.  

Go forth and conquer."}
{"text":"In a word: DISGUSTING!!!

In a few more words:  A diet was ruined for an entire week just by glancing in the direction of this restaurant. I hope this place keeps a cardiologist on the payroll! 

Each burger and dog is wrapped in tinfoil and are crushed while being shoved into a small paper sack. I watched the customers around me eating out of their grease soaked bags and started to feel a bit nauseous. My onion, relish, and mustard burger was overcooked and rather small in diameter. The only good thing I have to say about the burger was that the relish was very tasty!

The \"kosher\" cheese, bacon, and mustard dog... all I can say is that after one bite I couldn't touch the rest. The bacon was only warm at best as if sitting under a heat lamp for a few hours, and the dog itself was just unappealing.

The fries looked promising but lacked flavor. Did they sprinkle salt on them? I think that was what that glitter is supposed to be. At least vinegar, my favorite condiment, helped me to suffer through this painful meal. 

Overall: If you don't mind eating a meal that looks like you had to dig it out of a garbage can then this is your place!"}
{"text":"Two burgers and two drinks will set you back 26$. To much mula for an ok burger.   A large drink sets you back 3$."}
{"text":"It's Five Guys for SE of Calgary!

Staff super friendly and food is always fresh and delicious. 

Portions are large and pricing is fair for what you get! Love the fries can't go wrong with five guys or Cajun style. 

There are grilled cheese and hotdogs too. 

Family friendly and lots of room for large parties. 

Apple Pay accepted, sweet! 

Overall if you want fresh delicious burgers this is the place!"}
{"text":"Always good Five Guys. 

Burgers  taste fresh and French  are always delicious. 

Peanuts  everywhere so beware. 

Small menu but laser focus. Self serve pop. 

Overall service is great  and if you want good portion burger and fries this is the place."}
{"text":"I'm from Boston originally & our Five Guys is just out of this world. Here? Not so much. Chopped white onion on my burger instead of sauteed like at home...forget it. I had purchased a double with bacon & mushroom & got neither. So I called the next day & spoke with the manager Christina. She was very nice & accomidating. However, the replacement burger still had no mushroom & the bun was barely grilled. This burger was almost $13 bucks. $3.45 for a small fry. Pffft.Definately not worth the price. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Lines were long but moved fast.  In-and-out tastes like a discount burger joint compared to Five Guys.  Cajun fries where the best.  You get a grundle.  My wife and I shared a regular burger and a fry with more than enough food to go around.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Didn't end up eating here because the cashiers were sooooooo slow. 

Brother and I stood in line for 10 minutes with two other people in front of us. They had simple orders but cashiers were too busy chatting it up amongst themselves. Guys cooking burgers also looked dirty, gave my brother the 'let's leave' glance and never looked back."}
{"text":"My first experience with Five Guys was in Oregon and I have been a fan since!  Moving to Vegas and learning a nearby restaurant, I had to check it out!  It still does not disappoint! =)  

Size of the burger is more than enough, I usually get the bacon cheese burger with grilled onions and mushroom, ketchup, mustard, lettuce and tomatoes!  If you're going to eat a burger, might as well go all out and load up the carbs and calories right? ;-) 

If you're looking for a good burger at a cheap price, this is not the place to go, check out In N Out, cheap and still delicious!  Five Guys was a bit pricey and I was shocked on how much a meal cost!  It was worth it! 

The Cajun fries they serve here is amazing!  

One of the downsides from my experience at the Vegas branch was that they forgot my bacon....I went and asked for it and they gave it to me.  So that was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place has the cheesiest food! The cheesier the better. The fries are kinda small and they put it in a small cup which is not that worth it. There aren't a lot of vegetarian options and the vegetarian options that they do have come with no Patty. I would expect this to be less expensive but it's actually almost just as expensive as getting the meat option which makes no sense to me. The place itself is very spacious and is located in a very popular area. The person who takes the order is very helpful and nice. A little too pricy for the food they offer."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place?  Simple menu with great burgers and fries.  Really all you have to know.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Blech. ~$5 burger that I could hardly differentiate from one of those things wrapped in foil for 3 days at AM/PM. Didn't even finish it.

Also, the employees laughing and goofing around while some seriously fucked up, tripping, bloody homeless guy traipsed through the place purposely smearing his blood and sweat all over the people and the equipment didn't exactly wet my appetite. If he tried to touch my daughter I would have killed him with our stroller and then started in on the staff.

Extra star for the now bloody pile of peanuts and potato in the middle of the room. That's pretty fun."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in here for the first time! First of all, the girl at the register was super nice about explaining the menu and ordering process for us first-timers. I also like the free peanuts while you wait for your order. I ordered a little burger with bacon and the bacon was fantastic. It was crispy and they were not stingy with it. My husband ordered a regular cheeseburger. He said the cheese wasn't that great. I like the fact that they are hand formed patties but mine was falling apart which was kind of annoying. The fries were really good as well and I would like to go back to try the cajun style ones. On a side note, my sister went into the bathroom while we were there and she said it was clean and smelled like cinnamon so thats a plus as well! Overall, the food was good, but nothing to die for."}
{"text":"This place is great. We went here for dinner last night. The food was fresh and really good. I love their burgers and will for sure be back. Also the service was very quick."}
{"text":"First time there and all I can say is that it was gooooood...

The only downside was that they were smaller than i expected, but good nonetheless...

I liked the free peanuts as appetizers while waiting for the burgers..."}
{"text":"I mean, the burgers.  You go here for the burgers.  I usually try to stick to salads, but that just wasn't happening when the car miraculously drove itself to Five Guys.  How did that happen???

I went to Five Guys on a Monday around 9pm.  Admittedly, it was one of the only places open on the holiday weekend and I was starving.  When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by the guy working the register.  He was so incredibly nice and friendly.  One Cheeseburger and Fries, coming right up!

While I was waiting, I went in to use the restroom.  Ok, yeah, I know it's weird to comment on restrooms in a restaurant review, but the facility was CLEAN.  Like really clean.  It sort of makes you think \"ok, if the bathroom is this clean, this location must take pride in their jobs and keep a clean kitchen\".  Who knows if it's true.

I munched on some peanuts while they were making my order.  When it came, I got it to go.  Burger was made perfectly.  Yummmmmmmm!  Fries were good but super salty.  I'm not sure if I got the \"end of day\" fries maybe?

It's been a while since I've been to Five Guys, and I forgot how much I love the burgers!  This location was exceptionally friendly, clean and accurate with my orders, so I'll be back for another late night dinner (or craving)."}
{"text":"I think I might be the last person who knew about the Surprise location, but better late than never! 

The place was stuffed to the brim on a Sunday night, you had to find a place to stand and according to the nice lady in line behind me, it's always like this :)

The burgers are fresh, better quality than most fast food restaurants, & yes, you get to pick your toppings,,,, but (don't hate me!!) I like In & Out burgers just a tad bit more. Both my daughter and I got the little burger, which is a single patty vs the 2 patties that come on the regular burger. 

The CAJUN FRIES on the other hand are literally to die for! Best I've ever had, hands down! The portions are HUGE. 1 order could easily feed 4 normal people or 2 teenagers :D  They are also REALLY greasy, so I could not recommend you eat them on a daily basis, but if I want to splurge this is where I would do it. 

The kids behind the counter were working at full speed (they must be EXHAUSTED when they get home!) & all seemed to genuinely enjoy their work. That always makes the experience better, especially since you're watching them cook up the orders...... there's no where else to look, lol. 

Be prepared to take your meal to go, seating is limited. My daughter & I managed to snag a table, but I must say that I felt a tiny bit odd eating while a line full of people watched on (some circling the table) so they could get dibs as soon as we were done, lol. Oh well, now a larger population know that I'm a messy eater :)"}
{"text":"Busy or not, 20 minutes is a ridiculous amount of time to make a double cheese burger and an order of small fries."}
{"text":"Ok haters, I don't care what you say, this place is good. These burgers are delicious!! Yes it was packed, but it just opened, it will die down. The fries are good, they give you a ton. These burgers are made the way they should be. You tell them everything you want on it, not what to take off. If you never had it, and you like fat burger & in-n-out, get in here and try it!"}
{"text":"Got a really pushy cashier even after I kindly declined upsizing. The food was tasty but did they shrink their burger sizes? I remember being more full when i tried it when it first came to Canada. Maybe someone on Yelp can confirm this! Anywho, the place was bopping with people at around 7PM on new years eve. The meal was satisfying and filling as it is NYE and my night will only continue to countdown. Happy New Years Yelpers!

Update: just confirmed with friends and colleagues - we all agree burger shrank!!"}
{"text":"Five Guys is out to prove that just because you're a chain doesn't mean your food has to stink.  Anyplace where you can get a hot, juicy, freshly made hamburger with all the fixings - including sauteed onions and mushrooms - for under $4.00 is a winner in my book.

Five Guys' newest Cleveland-area location, in Fairview's recently rebuilt Westgate Mall, has a clean, airy feeling, with high ceilings and old time rock-and-roll playing a decent volume.  Every hamburger comes with exactly the fixings that you choose from their extensive list - about the only thing missing is chili and sauerkraut.  The fries are fresh cut and a sign in the waiting area informs you what kind of potato is being used today as well as the state from which the potatoes originate.  Ketchup and malt vinegar are available for the potatoes, and the soda fountain is self-serve with free refills.

Five Guys provides a filling and tasty burger for a highly reasonable price.  It's a great spot for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is located right near the eatons centre. A friend and I were hungry, decided to check it out...

The place kind of looks like a retro diner, they claim to use fresh potatoes and 100% real meat. There are NO COMBOS and I had to buy the burger, drink and fries separate. Good for people that would want to skip the fries!

The toppings on burgers are free and there is a wide selection, though most of the toppings I actually picked were incorrect when my burger actually came. 

The burger was not \"juicy\" as they claim but they do have an open window kitchen, so you can watch your burger being made. Most of the staff seem like high school or post secondary school students. My friend, a chef said it was odd some fries were brownish while others were golden, possibly mixing older fries with newer fries. 

Bottomless drinks (free refills)

Overall, my burger, fries and drink cost around $15. In my opinion, it felt like a normal burger joint. Wasn't worth it but at the same time it wasn't terrible. 

3/5."}
{"text":"So so so so so nice. I ordered a hot dog against my better judgment and it was nevertheless awesome. They sort of slice it lengthwise and serve it more-or-less like they would a burger. One acquaintance who has more experience than I do with Five Guys says these guys are a little skimpier than usual about filling your bag up to the top with fries. But hey, I didn't know they actually did that at all (I haven't gone in years), so I wasn't about to complain.

Had a bite of a homie's poutine too and it was worth it.

Also, don't feel too guilty! Fries are nutritious! So much Vitamin C!!!"}
{"text":"I know what to expect when I come here, and they didn't disappoint. Greasy. Check.
Quick. Check. Cold Coca Cola. Check. Good pickles. Check. 
All the things I have learned to love about each location. But this one was different. The air conditioning wasn't blasting on my food. I was partly disappointed because I had just trekked across the hot parking lot from the outlet mall. But as always. Five guys comes out ahead with their Cajun style fries. Although they give you too many but, that's ok."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of Five Guys Burgers and Fries whenever I travel in the US. I was really looking forward to see the red and white checker boards try it's way into the Canadian market. They have crossed the borders under the \"Five Guys Hamburgers et Frites\" in the Montreal region, using the same foiled wrapped burgers and hand cut fries they are known for in the US. Everything is cooked on a grill, dressed the way you like and messy when you eat it... Promise. 

The menu is kept simple: Burgers, hot dogs and fries. I tried everything on the menu and it does the job right in the greasy department. I find their burgers overcooked but nicely stuffed, the sliced hot dog on the grill tasty but expensive and fries will have you come back for more. Careful when ordering \"all-dressed\", nobody bothered understand what we go by around here. 

Expect to pay above average for your favorite fast food: A burger will cost you $5~7, one hot dog goes for $4 and fries $4~5. The large drink is useless unless you didn't know it was free refills. 

I'm not sure how well the franchise will be doing in the land of \"La Belle Province\", but where the POUTINE rules, how can you afford not to have any on the menu!?"}
{"text":"First time here, great experience! Fast, friendly service. We got 2 little bacon cheeseburgers, regular fries, and regular pop. Very filling, go for the little burgers if you don't want to be super full you can't breath! All toppings are free like grilled onions, jalape√±os, etc. Soft drinks have free refills too. You can also have some peanuts you can help yourself too when you come in the door. For all this food it came up to $23 but I would gladly pay this again because it's quality good and super tasty. They also give you a extra scoop of fries in the bag on top of whatever size fries you choose! So let's say you get a regular fry, it's enough for two people.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The cashier was really nice and had a competition on who had the worst morning - I won. LOL Later she walked around wiping tables and asking everyone if they needed anything else that she can run and grab.

Get the small burger and fries, because its not small at all. I got the works, at first I thought it would be overwhelming, but it was good! The fries were okay.

My coworker got the grilled cheese....I could've made that at home.

The fountain drink station was cool. Except all Coke products were out."}
{"text":"MEDIOCRE - I went to Five Guys for lunch the other day because my friend was raving about how great it was; the last time that I had driven by the line was out the door, so I figure it had to be pretty good. I was wrong. The food wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't anything to write home about.

I think that part of my problem was that I like my burgers pink in the middle and Five Guys cooks their burgers into burnt little hockey pucks...which might be your thing, but it is definitely not mine."}
{"text":"Great food but music can get loud.. Probably to help keep a false sense of energy in the place.."}
{"text":"Friendly folks. Serviceable burgers. This is a 3 Star spot that gets a 1-Star decrement because I have found no way to voice my order such that I get Extra Freakin' Lettuce (henceforth to be referred to as EFL).

It's truly been a years long quest. I've done the experiment in which a burger is ordered with just lettuce and one with extra lettuce. Same amount of lettuce. I could wax on, but I'm not feeling that poetic or wound up right now.

I'll try for EFL sometime again in the future, mostly because it's personal now, I'm baffled. Curse you Draconian lettuce horders of Five Guys. 1 Star I withhold from you... I shall have my day!"}
{"text":"Hamburgers really great but honestly I don't like the bun, it is kinda soggy from the foil because of the heat. But i love the fries, and it's not bad for a quick bite but kinda pricey, you can get a double double and fry for 8 dollars at in and out and doesn't cost you 14 dollars for a burger."}
{"text":"Time to update my review.  Since my last review 2 yrs ago, we've come here several times and it has improved.  It's of my Son's favorite places for Burgers.  The Cajun Fries are outstanding and the Burgers are top notch.

We also love the Coke machine that has a ton of flavors and you can create your own soft drink creation.

{"text":"We ordered three burgers and three large drinks and three large fries for three guys.. There was so much food we couldn't even come close to finishing.

I love how they fill the fry tray (what do you call those things? The cardboard rectangular things that takeout fries come in.. kinda looks like a basket.. whatever, you know what I mean).. so yeah, they fill the 'tray' with fries and drop it into a paper bag.. then they take a whole other scoop of fries and dump them into the bag too! Amazing.

Burgers are huge.. like really huge.. you don't need to order a double."}

It was pretty dead, but it was after the lunch rush after all. I ordered a little burger with jalape√±os and mushrooms. I have been recently restricted from dairy products, other wise I would have had a much loved cheese burger. I rounded out my order with Cajun fries and a coke.

The employees were pleasant and the music was groovy. 

I love 5 Guys Burger and Fries. If you haven't had the experience, put it on your to do!"}
{"text":"Not a regular burger eater, but ate at my first Five Guys in Colorado and ate here and had the same experience.  Loved the burger fully loaded, and the fries are so flippin good and more than you could ever eat.  The Chandler place employees were really cheerful and singing as they worked.  You know they're happy."}
{"text":"I always have a great experience at this restaurant. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Quality of food is excellent, from juicy burgers to fresh fries. It is a great place to take our little ones because they have a couple of large tables in the back. Added bonus: the music is always amazing. Yes it is pricey for a burger joint, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I don't normally review chains, but this specific experience at Cinco Hombres was amazing. The fresh burger and fries were on point despite the 30-minute wait time. Yes, 30-minutes, but this was due to the fact that ASU was embarrassing themselves down the street in the Cactus Bowl. This hands down is the best Five Guys in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love all the toppings and burger creations you can make! They had peanuts!!! Awesome environment friendly staff! Deidre and Sandra made my experience fun and personable ... They were so nice and let me take my time when I was trying to decide what I wanted because I was picky. The best part is they offer Kosher friendly things on the menu!!! GRILLED ONIONS MMMM!!! My burger and fries were in the same league as IN-N-Out"}
{"text":"Can't imagine a more fun way to end the evening. We had been to several places but had Five Guys on our minds all day.  They don't close until 10PM so we booked it home and pulled in with plenty of time to spare. 

The menu here is so simple. Basic burgers, fries, and drinks. But their basics are all about the fundementals. Better prep, better cooking, and better delivery are what makes them far superior to similar competitors.  Love it.  I just can't get the smell out of my mind.  The burgers are crazy greasy tasty and the fries are like deep fried popsicles. Yum.

Service here is nothing less than awesome.  The team member who took my order had all sorts of fun describing fry sizes and comparing them to the sizes of various co-workers. Haven't laughed that hard in quite some time.  

It didn't all that long for them to fix up my burger and fries.  The whole while I just sat back and watched as they sang tunes and seemed to genuinely enjoy preparing the orders. It always makes everything so much better when the folks cooking are having fun.  

Great place. I love the team and the grease only makes me smile more.

Kudos all around!"}
{"text":"Love Five Guys Burgers.  It is one of the best burgers in the area for the price.  Always fresh and you get plenty of fries to share."}
{"text":"Delish! Tasty burger, fresh cut fries, and shell-your-own peanuts! Love it!

The line up was a bit long, so it took a while to get our order, but we just helped ourselves to some peanuts and pop, and waited it out.

My burger was juicy, savory, and everything it should be. Had pickle and tomato juice running down my arm! 

Fries were overflowing. Luckily we shared an order.

Food must have been √ºber salty tho, as I have been super thirsty since our visit, but I can see myself craving these burgers!"}
{"text":"If you're craving a nice big burger that's cooked and dressed right. This is the place for you.

I don't eat red meat often. But, when I get that craving I prefer to go to 5 guys. It's fast and I'm able to pick what I want. The meat is good. I know that, because I NEVER get ill. 

The shakes are incredibly tasty and just what you need. The fries? Uhhhh, well let me tell you, we have to pick up extra so my husband has some. Lol

{"text":"This is an awesome place great service all the time I come here. Fredi keep up the good work he is very friendly I definitely recommend this place. Place is very clean and outstanding service."}
{"text":"This is the best burger place in town. Amazing incredible so delicious once you try it you will always want more booomb"}
{"text":"I cannot for the life of me understand the hype with this place. The meat is unseasoned and all of their topping are so basic I could probably do a better job just cooking at home. There is absolutely nothing about this place that makes it worth going to and I think people need to stop jumping on bandwagons just because they can."}
{"text":"Five Guys is a reliable staple at any location, although it's a chain I love the origin story and the cute newspaper articles on the wall. The red and white decor is nostalgic and they offer peanuts to snack on in line which is a-okay in my book. 

The fries are of a monsterous proportion but that never stops me from finishing them. The burgers are made fresh to order and you can really customize the toppings for whatever you prefer. Definitely filled me up and ensured I was not hangry for my IKEA run!"}
{"text":"been here twice now, and the burgers are awesome.  i love the ability to build my own burgers on the phone APP at a stop light and then pick it up 15 minutes later.  the first time i went for some reason the order never got made but i only had to wait a few extra minutes and they got it for me (and the workers were VERY apologetic) 

It;s close, good price, and good food, and i will keep going back"}
{"text":"This was delicious! Good service and fresh food! Hands down best burger and fries in Vegas! I definitely will be going back again."}
{"text":"The fries are the best.  This place just isn't as clean as it used to be, starting to look like a Chinese buffet. They have changed managers a lot since they opened."}
{"text":"Look if your in a pinch, it's late your in Erin Mills, and your choice is between this and any of the larger chains I would take them anyday. I eat here every so often when I don't want to make the drive to streetsville or port credit and they are not half bad, I do enjoy them and find them better then most restaurants out there. One thing I am not a fan of is they go for that fifties dinner feeling (which no one under the age of 40 gets anymore) and they don't even serve milkshakes or floats? Come on if you want to remember a different era don't just feed us peanuts and half decent burgers give us something else to enjoy! 

My only advice do not have the hotdogs you can boil your own at home and it will taste the same!"}
{"text":"The burgers are big and will fill you up.  However, it's awfully expensive for a burger joint especially with Habit Burger so close and so fresh and delicious and cheaper.

The burgers are greasy and sit heavy on your stomach for lunch."}
{"text":"Drove up and thought \"I want five guys for lunch...\". Um, anyways I had no idea everything was a double patty. I had my meal to go, because who wants five guys for lunch in public, right?
Seriously, I removed all the bread, shamelessly ate the hamburger and bacon, as well as obliterated the fries. Likely once every 3 months I eat like this.
Good eats if you are fit and feisty. Not a great option for us old folk. Yummy tho"}
{"text":"Five Guys is definitely on top when it comes to fast food burgers.  The food is made to order but still ready pretty quickly.  

You pick your burger size (single patty is a \"little burger\"), if you want cheese or bacon, and choose from tons of free toppings like grilled onions and mushrooms.  The \"little\" burger is a bit of a misnomer because it is very filling (IMO).

It gets a little messy if you order your burger wrapped in lettuce, but now you can also get it in a little plastic tray if you want go bunless.  You can also order fries (regular or Cajun), but if you dig into the free peanuts while you wait for your burger, you may question your decision to order fries.  We never wind up eating them and one order is definitely large enough to share with a few people.

A couple visits ago I tried the BLT for a change of pace.  I was a little skeptical about a BLT on a burger bun, but it was fantastic.  Crunchy lettuce and bacon.  Perfect.

This location has two Freestyle Coke machines; which I personally love, and ample indoor seating.  Great choice for a quick, under $10 lunch."}
{"text":"There is only one dollar sign on the description. Their basic hamburgers is $7, a drink and Fries puts it close to $13 plus tax. I got only their basic $7 Burger to get a two patty pile of mush that flew out of the bun the first bite I took. I did not enjoy that. Ended up having to eat it with a knife and a fork off a plate, and it was nasty that way. Defeats the purpose of a hamburger. Other than that basically a boring burger. There are no combo meals, no children's meal, no senior discount, and the only freebies are peanuts in the shells. BFD. Never again."}
{"text":"My 2nd Favorite Burger Joint in Toronto/Vaughan

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Ordered a double bacon cheeseburger combo was very disappointed, very dry way overpriced and Denny's does a better job with their monster burger. Five guys combo $15 + is ridiculous for such poor quality will not be going back here or any other five guys.  Denny's $18. For Burg, Fries, Drink & Tip"}
{"text":"The staff here are extremely friendly which is a bonus, because their burgers are soo good! Dont mind paying a little more for great burgers, fries and great service."}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe some of the bad reviews.  Makes me question your taste buds.  OK OK, I will give you that the music is too loud and they should have Milk Shakes.  But to tell me the burger was not good or get this, one clown said it was too big, LOL.  Learn to read the menu and order the \"Little Hamburg\" if thats all you can handle.  Anyone that loves burgers will enjoy Five Guys!  And to compare them to Wendy's only confirms you do not know burgers and your review is not worthy."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly sure why, but everyone I know RAVES about this place.
It's good... I mean they are burgers and fries... nothing extremely special, though.

Perhaps it was the time of night that my friend and I decided to visit.

The staff were friendly and immediately greeted us when we walked through the door.
The fries are gross due to the fact that they are literally swimming in grease, but the burger was pretty decent. 

I really like that the decor is kind of like a little diner. The peanuts threw me off a little bit, but that's cool, I guess. 

I will have to try it again another time."}
{"text":"Move over In-N-Out!  Five Guys gets 5 stars from me!  

Numerous toppings to select from and a great \"classic cheesybugery flavor\" that sticks to your ribs.  You have  to pay a little more for cheese and/or bacon, but all of their burgers, hotdogs, and sandwiches come with the option to add up to 15 different toppings at no additional charge.  Mmmm...I love the grilled onions & mushrooms option.  You know you've done some eating when you leave FGBF.  

Have you ever had 2+ people in your party order the same thing (ie. cheeseburgers) with completely different toppings and then have them all tossed in the bag with no markings??  At FGBF they label each burger with a # that coordinates to the order in which your party placed their order.  I know it's a little thing, but it sooo delights me to not have to play musical burgers, trying to guess which one belongs to who.

Have no fear if you decide to make a pit stop while hanging with your cool vegan friends; they offer Vegan Sandwiches, which I've heard are quite tasty.  

I'm no newbie to Cajun Fries, as I'm originally from North Carolina, where I grew up eating Bojangle's Cajun Fries.  With that said, I did find FGBF a little overseasoned.  Next time I'm planning to ask if they can do lightly seasoned Cajun Fries, otherwise their regular fries are outstanding.  

The wait isn't long, but they offer peanuts to snack on (if you're not allergic) as you complete the final stage of your \"Get Some Beef in May Bellay\" mission.  

My favorite part is an often overlooked place to excel in the customer experience, the soda dispenser.  As I approached this fancy pants machine, I'm noticing all of these buttons!!  I press the Diet Coke button and then receive another (no less than) 6 options for flavored Diet Coke, ranging from cherry, cherry vanilla, vanilla, orange, lime, and one more.  They even offered all of these choices in the Caffeine Free Diet Coke variety as well.

They don't have a Drive-Thru window, but they offer online ordering."}
{"text":"You will definetly be impressed with the french fries, as they are now from good old Southern Alberta instead of Idaho."}
{"text":"I am actually sitting in 5 guys right now eating my burger. 

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger (which is a double), a regular fry and a large drink and it cost $12.00 and some change. 

At first I was shocked by the price of the meal and later on I was still shocked. 

The burger was juicy and tasted like a burger that I would make on my stove, nothing special about it. The bacon is what I was really after but was disappointed again. The bacon seemed like it had been cooked, reheated, cooked, reheated and so on and was just a lump sat on the bottom bun. 

The fries were probably the best part but again they tasted like I cooked them at home. I was not a fan of the Cajun seasoning that I had on the side, which tasted like a McCormick seasoning that you buy at the grocery store. 

I must correct myself, the drink was the best part. 5 Guys carries Coke products and they have \"Vault\" which I have really only found at Chuckie Cheese. 

I did not get to try the peanuts because I cant eat them, but its hard to mess up salted peanuts. 

All in all the food tasted good but not very memorable. I have heard that 5 Guys plans on opening a few more stores in the valley which I think might be a mistake. At the price of what you pay it would have cost me close to $40.00 dollars to feed a family of 4. That is just to much to pay for a plain tasting burger and somewhat soggy fries. 

I will go to In and Out when I am in the mood for a fast food burger."}
{"text":"Five guys is always excellent for a burger and fries - this location is no exception. The burgers are always juicy and amazing, the fries were fresh and crispy. The service at this location was also friendly and fast, stop here for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I've ever ordered from Five Guys since I'm between flight in D.C. 2013.  I got the little hamburger and little fry.  It took a while to get my order with two people inside and some orders must of been online.  The burger was good although it was getting soggy on a really short trip home."}
{"text":"Humans are not supposed to feel certain things.  For instance have you ever felt that you do indeed have a liver, right under the diaphgram in the right quadrant of your abdomen?  Well eat  the Five Guys burger and you will most definitely feel how this brownish organ which existence so far just vaguely guessed is kicking you in the abdominal wall, cursing you out and crying bloody tears of regret of being YOUR liver on the day you walked in that joint. 
Greasy and painful - two words describing my experience. And maybe their burgers are the best among all the other burgers that are supposed to clog your arteries and burn your liver - so what. As I am holding one right hand on a bag of organic spinach I promise my liver and the rest of internal organs not to return to that place. Ever.
Amen."}
{"text":"I have One Word for Five Guys: overrated. This place is way to pricey for food that is honestly no better tasting than In N Out. 

I've been here about 4 or 5 times, as I usually come after work around 7 p.m. I order something for me and something for my friend. Every time I've been here it hasn't been busy or crowded, but for some reason my food (2 cheeseburgers and an order of fries) sometimes takes 15 or even 20 minutes to prepare. I mean I appreciate the freshness of the food, but it's a little ridiculous that when there are literally NO other orders my food still takes that long.

The fries are probably the best thing about Five Guys. A small order of fries will be enough for 2 people, and they're good fries. Their burgers are really nothing spectacular. Like I said, you can get the same quality burger at In N Out for more than half the cost.

+1 star for the staff. They seem like friendly people and are always apologetic when my order takes long or if they mess it up. Unfortunately, they seem to be apologizing to me for that quite often.

If you find yourself in City Scape, I would recommend going to Jimmy Johns or Chipotle instead of Five Guys. Five Guys, in my opinion, is a waste of money."}
{"text":"First time trying 5 guys. The burger was really good!!! Reminded me of In N Out. It's cool that you can add as many toppings as you want. We ordered online and went in when the order was ready but still had to wait about 15 min because the don't fry the fries until you are present. The fries might have been the worst fries I have ever had. Ordered the regular and the cajun. They tasted really stale and had a slightly bitter and burnt flavor to them.  Probably ate about 5 of them before we gave up. Kind of disappointed since they were supposed to be fresh and they cost $5 each. Will be back for the burgers but will definitely never order any fries there again."}
{"text":"The food and service is great. The only reason why I wouldn't rate it at a four or five is due to the cost and dinning area hadn't been swept in some time. I was there for about 20-30 minutes with no action or attempt to clean lobby in place. I know it happens from time to time but there was enough employees to have 1 do a quick sweep through. Everyone has their days so I'll be back in the future."}
{"text":"I was in silver snail and every time I was at silver snail you can just smell the food. One day I caved in and just went. It was great!!! The Cajun fries are a die for a lil kick to them it was great. Its amazing how they give you more fries inside your bag just makes you a lil more happy. The burger is juicy and while you wait you can always enjoy free peanuts. This location has a great and friendly staff.

My one big thing is you have to get everything separate and not combos. 

If you want a hamburger that will fill you up this is the place to go."}
{"text":"LOUD!  It is so loud in there!  Did you hear me?  It's LOUD!

Really, that in itself is enough for me not to want to go back.  The food is good, price is right, but I should probably stick to carry-out if I can even stand to be in the restaurant that long.

That, coupled with the fact they really over air conditioned the restaurant and I don't consider myself to be an excessively cold person.  It's probably hot by the grill, but c'mon, it was freezing in there on an otherwise nice summer day.

Oh, also, it's soooo LOUD in there!"}
{"text":"Just tried Five Guys for the first time today. I ordered a hamburger which comes with 2 patties. I don't like a lot on my burger so I got mayo, ketchup, and lettuce. The lettuce was too warm so I could have done without that. But the burger was ok. I also tried their french fries and they were too cooked for my liking and also very salty. I think I would go back again but I would order the little burger which I hope is just one patty."}
{"text":"This place was good but definitely not worth the $10 for a mediocre burger. I could get it cheaper at McDonalds and it'll taste probably better. The fries though are a different story, those things are to die for. So delicious. Service here was great. Was in and out within 10 minutes and everything seemed fresh."}
{"text":"This place is sooo conveniently close to my office... it's hard not to go to often. But, as other reviewers have stated its a little pricey for a \"fast food\" style burger joint. Granted that this is NO McDonalds!! But... In and Out is not far away either... and they are pretty damn good too! This is a place I come 2 -3 times a month... more than that and you will need to see your doctor and have them check the cholesterol! 

I love the burgers here. They are huge, delicious, and fresh. Be careful ordering the larger order of fires... as they are huge! And you can get them with Cajun seasoning.  

One thing I absolutely love... as I am a gadget guy, and \"buttons\" make me happy... is the soft drink dispenser!!! It is uber-cool.... and hard not to play with!"}
{"text":"I give this place four stars because it's really outstanding  food! The fries are fresh cut and the hamburger meat is quality. However, their prices are way outta line compared to the  competition. Cheese burgers, fries, & a drink $14.00.?!?!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after the state boys basketball tournament (yeah Barneveld!)
The food was great. Just a little disheartened to watch them throw so much food away."}
{"text":"Awful and unprofessional service. Never returning to this one again. Employees standing around the counter talking while the restaurant is FILTHY. Forgot my bacon. No effort to replace the ketchup dispenser and the peanut bowls. Absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"So, this is a new location. Happened to be in the neighborhood, so we dropped in for a late lunch. We opted to share a burger, and they nicely cut it in half for us. Ordered a cheeseburger, small fries, and a drink. 

The cheeseburger...I'm not sure if it's normally a double patty but that's what we got. Everything is cooked to order, so it's fresh as can be. Love that...I hate when something has been sitting in a warming oven for who knows how long. And I can tell! 

So, I'm sure food is the same at every Five Guys but I am not sure about the service. I thought it was outstanding. Super nice workers- they even offer to assist you or get you things after you've had a seat. What kind of fast food joint has such great service? Next time you're craving a greasy burger and you're in Berea, go to Five Guys."}
{"text":"I had heard much abbout 5 Guys but this was my first trip there. The place was really busy when I arrived on Sunday afternoon around 1:30pm - not surprising given it's location in the Deerfoot Meadows shopping district. The line up was right to the door and took about 5-10 minutes to get to the front to order. I ordered a little cheeseburger, a regular fries and a regular drink. The total came to $12.46. Sure it's more pricy than your usual fast food burger combo - but the food is better. I didn't feel like crap or regretful after eatting like you usually do with the typical chain fast food places. Other reviews here say that the burgers get really sloppy and soggy - sure I guess they would if you put the hot toppings (cooked mushrooms or onions, etc) or all the sauces on it. I just put the regular lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, mayo and pickles on it and it was great (not too soggy). As for the burger, I only got the little burger (which means one beef patty instead of two), that was more than enough for me (an average sized woman). No need to spend the extra $2 for the regular burger. They also give you tons of fries. The regular size is really plenty for 2 people.

My only negatives/complaints would be this:
1. The wait time from order to actually receiving your food. I waited 25 minutes. I think they could be more proactive in cooking patties in advance. I suspect that is what slows the process down - not necessarily the custom assembly.
2. Their decor sort of screams - we are an awesome \"American\" burger joint.
3. It is quite a noisy place and feels a bit chaotic.

My favorite part of 5 guys is definately their fries! Crispy, salty and lots of them...mmm

Well worth a try if you like a good burger and fries."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favourite burger places in Ajax. The customer service is great and so is the food and for the prices its definitely worth it. 

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 burgers and 1 fry between my wife and I. The fries were over $4 and are a lousy little cup full. Burger was $8 and couldn't even hold a candle to an In and Out burger. Sorry way overpriced ripoff!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at a Five Guys and I think the hype has me disappointed. Burgers were good, fries were soggy and no kids meals or milk shakes?  What kind of burger joint doesn't have milk shakes?

I liked the fries and burger toppings better than In & Out, but without milk shakes I will stick to In & Out."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I have placed an online order and they have forgotten something in my order. Ok fine. It happens. But what really gets me is when you call and let them know and then ask if they can refund that products amount, the answer is they can't. They say I will have to go back to the restaurant and then they can do it. Well I am 10 miles away one way and if I went back for a refund then why wouldn't I just get the product they forgot!? So basically they know I'm not going to drive back 20 miles round trip to get one product so they offer no refund and I pay for a product I never received. Great."}
{"text":"This place is so cool!

Build you hamburger  just like you want!

Heck Yes, Awesome  all the peanuts  you want to eat while waiting for your food and during your meal! great source of protein, Go Fitness and Nutrition!

Ok, enough of that, now for a calorie overload!

Omg their bacon , cheese , tomato  and ketchup with juicy beef is incredible and totally yum  !

Then onto the fries, they are awesome  and give you so much!

By the time you leave, you are stuffed like a chicken  lol  

Staff is profession, clean dining and a must go!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I crave a big, juicy burger.  On a recent Friday, a few co-workers and I went to Five Guys to get our dose of beefy goodness.

The menu is simple - burgers, hot dogs and fries.  One thing that is important to know is that the regular burgers come with two patties, while the 'little' burgers come with one.  Convinced (or perhaps challenged) by my co-workers to try the full-size, I went with the cheeseburger.  From the long list of toppings (all free) I chose to go 'all the way' except for the tomato which meant mayo, mustard, ketchup, lettuce, pickles,  grilled onions and mushrooms.  The burger was pretty good - juicy and messy.  I think I should have skipped the grilled onions, though, as there were far too many of them.

The fries come in two sizes (big and huge) and two ways - regular and cajun.  We shared a large order of cajun fries among the three of us, and I think it would have taken two more people to finish them.  The fries were thick-cut, which I really like, but the cajun seasoning made them very salty.

All orders are served up in plain brown paper bags, even if you are not taking the food to-go.  A cute idea, except that the brown paper really soaks up that french fry grease.  I know burgers & fries are greasy.  Duh.  I just don't want to have such obvious visual confirmation of that.  The shiny glistening sheen that had soaked through the brown paper bag was NOT what I wanted to see after finishing my meal.

Overall a tasty burger, and so-so fries.  Would I have the burger again?  Sure.  However, Five Guys will not replace In-N-Out as my go-to place to satisfy my burger cravings.  Yes, I will always be a California girl at heart!"}
{"text":"They took out a decent burger joint (Create) and put in the burger place that everyone raves about.  I'm pretty happy with the Smashburger down the street for my fast food burger needs, but I thought I'd give it a try.  It was good, but I'm afraid it just didn't blow me away.  Smashburger seems to be slightly cheaper, and with a much better taste."}
{"text":"One of the best five guys I've stopped in.  Clean, burgers were great, fries were super hot and crispy and customer service was fantastic!  Seems like everyone behind the counter was having a great day and it was infectious.  We were just stopping through while traveling but I'll remember this location when we come through next time.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about 5 guys but just recently had the privilege of eating there.  I was blown away! The burgers was not fancy, just a classic burger but everything was done so well.  They put a ton of fries in as well.  The fries are fresh cut at the store and were fantastic as well.  Definitely not the healthiest of meals but a very tasty one."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and fries!  After weeks of dieting this custom burger melted in my mouth.  Delicious and wonderfully greasy!  The fries were a very large portion...be sure to split with your date :)"}
{"text":"Food is yummy!!!! I have never been to a 5 Guys, so I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a burger, unaware that it is actually a double burger, which was HUGE! Hubby and I shared a large fry. We could have easily split a burger and a small fry. Love that fact that \"everything\" includes grilled mushrooms and onions. So much food. This location was messy. I am not sure of the peanuts are a great idea because there are shells and dust everywhere."}
{"text":"I'm glad we went back after our 2 star visit 2 weeks ago. Much better upgrades with employees, service, food, ect.. the only thing we didnt get this time was the milk shake. There was one annoying worker there who was very loud and annoying. Very hard to eat while she was joking around and giggling. But other than that it was a good time. Burgers were perfect!. Large Fry was so many fries!( unlike the large fry [that seemed like a small fry]) will definetly go back soon!"}
{"text":"2 stars for fast and friendly service. Other than that imagine a burger from wendys for double the price. And super salty peanuts. Oh and fries are better at wendys. For these prices check out lbs a burger joint inside of red rock. Waaayyyyyy betterr!"}
{"text":"Calgary's newest Five Guys just opened this week. 

I visited over their first weekend and they seem to have things running quite well already. I would assume the staff had been training at another location to get ready for this opening and you can tell. It was busy as to be expected but my order still came in a timely manner and it was correct.

My girlfriend and I seemed to have come between rushes as the dining area was a little bit in shambles, but there wasn't a line of people until a few minutes after we ordered. Though the dining area was a mess the staff were on it right away and quickly cleaned things up.

My burger was delicious and the fries were hot and fresh. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Never been to this location but I went and it was nice and clean and great good atmosphere the staff where nice and when your order you have you have to order everything by itself they don't have a combo but that's ok the burger was so good they put 2 burgers and double cheese in one burger and that's amazing and the fries is fresh and so good they have Cajun and salty and I recommend the Cajun but the salty is good too but they have hot dogs too but didn't try them yet so next time . Ps .. when you order fries to go they put an extra scoop on fries and that's is so cool so a bag of fires :) 

So I highly recommend this place :) 10/10"}
{"text":"Five Guys Burgers and Fries deserves much better than two stars on one hand, but on the other, the more harsh critics have salient points.

Five Guys has the dubious distinction of having a location in the Stockyards, which was a hulking, ugly directionless mess before Target cut and ran. Today the centre is a jumbled collection of minimal variety and empty storefronts.

If you can deal with the Stockyards, Five Guys has a great burger. It is freshly cooked and generally better than any chain burger. The bun is fresh and toppings are generous.

They also have great fries, but these are sold separately from the burgers and the fountain drinks.  All three can run 15$, making it pricey, especially for the neighbourhood. One option is to skip the fries and eat the free peanuts that are abundantly available and useful while you are waiting for your burger to cook.

The big negative here is that the place is often a mess. When you walk into a restaurant and it looks like no one gives a shit (dirty tables, peanut shells everywhere, drink station a mess), it doesn't inspire repeat business. If 5 Guys took more pride in its dining room (and subsequently respected its customers), it would be a viable contender in the higher end burger chain category, as well as the Chipotle across the parking deck."}
{"text":"The staff at this place is great and the food was too."}
{"text":"Awesome burger - but please do tell me when a burger, a drink and french fries started costing $18.95. Wtf??"}
{"text":"Best fast food burger.  The peanut oil is a nice touch.  Greasy, quick burgers with delicious fries (cajun are the best)."}
{"text":"I'm from DC and I've been enjoying Five Guys for about 8 years. I still think they are the best fast-food burgers in the business."}
{"text":"Just. So. Good.

You know it's almost 10$ for the double patty cheese on its own..with tax..but be real..you are spending that on an unsatisfying-white-white-girl-extrawhipshopfrapp  across the parking lot..and here you leave greasy and full and smell..and with peanuts in your pocket for your pet rat or to make friends with the local squirrel."}
{"text":"picked up burgers for the in laws after a horrible day at the surgery center. So, my review is based on the feedback from them, and our experience ordering. Mr C and I have not personally tried the burgers yet, but we will. 

Monday night, around 7:15 PM. The place is packed. Yes, its noisy and has hard rock music playing, loudly.  Good thing we knew ahead of time that the folks wanted the 'little' burgers, otherwise we would have ordered them a regular.. which is huge. Also, we started to order large fries, but the gal at counter said, you may only want the regular, which is enough for 2-2.5 people.  So, for $13 bucks, we ordered a little cheeseburger, and a little hamburger and specified what we wanted on them and a regular french fry. 
 We stood and watched as the 10+ orders ahead of ours were prepared, and it was a pretty smooth operation. The burgers are fried on a flat top grill, and the toppings looked of good quality and liberal. 

Oh.. lots of peanuts to be had, so if you have a severe peanut allergy, you will want to avoid this place. 

I picked up dad next morning for his post op appointment and he was quick to say how good the burgers and fries were.  

So, Mr C & I will give this place a try one of these days and then Ill update my review from my perspective on the burger."}
{"text":"I do NOT get the low reviews. I've been to THIS location 10+ times. It is my go-to burger joint in downtown Toronto. My extended family all love it as well. My business associates who I take here all love it. We're talking about 20 people who all have nothing but good to say about this chain. Burger patties are delish. As is the cheese, the buns, the condiments, the salted fries. I have gravitated to the regular (i.e. double patty) cheeseburger. Service consistently above average. Need to keep the lobby a bit cleaner.  I eagerly anticipate my next outing."}
{"text":"Ground Chuck hand pressed burgers, hand cut fries in peanut oil (not canola) - beats the typical fast food restaurant hands down - I'd give it 5 stars but it only gets a 4star rating because they use processed cheese on their burger instead of real cheddar, It tastes like I'm eating plastic. For the money a real slice of cheddar would be nice, and expected. I'd even pay more - after all cedda' is betta' :-)"}
{"text":"This location is the first and only Five Guys I've ever been to.  Like most, I heard of about it from various Americans I associate with.  Reviews ranged from 'It's not bad' to 'OH MY SWEET BABY JESUS! FIVE GUYS IS THE BEST'.  Like come on, I sure most of us have seen/heard of the 'DAYM DAYM DAYM' Five Guys review (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGkHRa64sDY).  Hell, even Obama endorses it.  I dare you to watch that video and not crave a burger.  So, to drown my perpetual sorrow that In N' Out isn't in Canada - I was excited to have Five Guys in my mouth... PAUSE!

First of all, everything here is Ameri-sized.  The regular burger is double patty and the 'little burger' is a single patty.  And an order of fries is HUGE and probably enough for 3-4 people.  According to my friends, they do this at all locations - I guess it's just their corporate policy.

I ordered a regular bacon cheeseburger (this is how I keep my slim figure).  You have your choice of 'free' toppings so you can customize to your taste - they have jalapenos and mushrooms.  The burger itself is good - nothing really special, but definitely solid.  The cheese was loaded up and had ooze and melded with the foil wrapping.  And there was a lot of crispy bacon loaded up on it.  At about $10, it wasn't exactly cheap - but was definitely enough cow, pig and cheese on the burger to justify the cost.

The surprise here was the veggie sandwich - it's a patty-less sandwich stuffed with cheese, mushrooms, and lots of other veggies.  So, it's not really a healthy option per se, but at $4 - it's pretty cheap.

The fries here are pretty damned good.  They are crispy and fried to order.  You can have them regular or seasoned 'Cajun' style.  I would highly recommend getting *one* order of fries - they basically place your burger in a brown bag... then proceed to fill the rest of your bag up with fries.  If you're walking out of here with a take-out bag with fries, you will have a brown bag translucent in grease.

So - I really don't understand the hype - but it's a solid burger joint and the service is good.  Unlike the cheap, neat and squared away style of In N' Out, Five Guys is all about excess.  Huge greasy burgers, huge greasy fries and in the upper limits of what I would pay for a chain burger.  Eat Five Guys if you're not planning to do much for the rest of the day.  I ended up falling asleep on the couch afterwards."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just want a big ol' burger and fries.   When those times happen, you gotta love Five Guys.  They're a step above a normal burger chain.    I'm glad they're here in Gilbert now.   

This place is immaculate and the burgers are fast.    Not a bad deal."}
{"text":"Fresh not frozen beef, fast friendly service and all the peanuts you can eat while you wait"}
{"text":"5 star burgers and five star fries.Big burgers and massive quantities of fries - and now shakes and a BLT worthy of the 5G name.

Certainly pricier than the low end of Mickey D's but you do get a lot for your money and I do love A-1 on a burger. Lettuce is fresh and crispy and the tomato slices are bigger and thicker and more flavorful than the typical fast food burger's. And the BLT? Worthy! Most worthy! Stacked high, crammed full of crispy bacon, crisp lettuce, and decent portion of sliced tomatoes. Much better than last skimpy BLT paid more for elsewhere.
As many have noted, the fries come by the brown paper bag full.  Now considering they're FRIES which would seem to suggest that they might have been FRIED, it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that if you leave them in unwaxed  brown paper for any amount of time it will soon be covered in oil spots.  But you need to eat fries fast for flavor and besides, fries don't travel well so your oily bag really shouldn't be such a trauma.   Regardless, 5G fries have the most genuine potato-ey flavor of any of the faster food chains. Compliments on consistently friendly courteous staff, clean well-stocked men's room on the couple occasions used. 

Five star burgers, five star fries, five star courtesy.  The music is still a bit loud to order or converse over, but that may be intended to deter excess loitering - if by no one else but semi senior citizens such as myself.  Worthy burgers. Worthy fries, shakes, and BLT.  Worth your business."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good five guys burger? I love the Cajun fries but my wife doesn't like them because they aren't crispy enough. The burgers here are restaurant quality and the bacon is crispy. It's a casual atmosphere but restaurant style food so this place is a win. They also have good shakes so this place is right up there with in n out and shake shack!!"}
{"text":"I just don't get the hype. My in laws bring five guys home about once every two weeks and they're so excited, as is my fianc√©e. I told them to stop bringing some for me. The burgers are always greasy and soggy and almost inedible. I even tried going in and eating inside to see if it would be better. It wasn't. I tried a hotdog and it was the same story. Soggy and way too greasy. The fries are OK, but nothing special. Honestly, I'd rather go to McDonald's. I do like the drink machine however......"}
{"text":"This Five Guys isn't the most convenient, since it is in the mall, but at least it is located toward the access road, so you don't have to actually go in to the mall.  I would die.

The location is, for the most part, clean. The music is pretty overwhelming, like I'm in a club for hipsters. One minute Tom Petty and the next some bluegrassy boy band. Unless you are standing right at the pick-up counter, good luck hearing that your food is ready.

Thank goodness you can now order your Five Guys fare online for pick-up.  It's cool that they make your fries when you get there so that they are fresh. However, it took so long to get them that one may wonder why they ordered ahead in the first place. I had ordered a drink as well, and when the guy slid my bag across the counter with no cup, I informed him that I had a drink too. The reply was \"go over there and tell them to give you a cup\" (them being the order counter).

The fries are normally awesome. Today my Cajun fries were just killed with spice. Virtually inedible. I went though 40 oz. of water during a 15 minute lunch! My little bacon burger was good. Better than some other fast food crap, but not exactly what you would assume you would get for your money.

I have come here before, and will likely come again in the future. Just a bit disappointed in this visit."}
{"text":"It's good to know that this Five Guys hasn't reverted to a smashed patty, like in Utah. They were nice and thick, juicy and tasty. I got tomato, onion, lettuce and a little mayo.  SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Glad this location is finally open. It was a great experience and great cheeseburger. My cheeseburger was made neatly with the grilled jalape√±os in between my meat like I used to stuff my fries as a kid."}
{"text":"A lot of bang for your buck... You definitely won't leave this place hungry. For lighter eaters, get a small burger and split the fries... A full order is enough to feed an army!"}
{"text":"Don't know if it was bad timing but this place was slower than a herd of snails traveling through peanut butter.  

This might be because they had (3) people working not \"Five\" as the name dictates. However, the gentlemen who was taking the orders was professional and showed composure. Luckily I ordered when no one was there because a line of nine souls quickly formed.  Took thirty- four minutes for my Little Bacon Cheeseburger w/ lettuce, tomato, onion(raw) and A1 sauce.  Of course fires and of course, I regretted it because they give you so much.  But, I guess some people like that.  

Burger was good. Bacon was great. Although I really don't get why people like this place so much.  It's not worth the price and I don't see the value proposition."}
{"text":"Great place for a burger, fries, and a soft drink from the pimped out Coke machine. Five guys will never let you down!"}
{"text":"I just want to say grilled cheese bacon cheese buger!!! Yum, Yum. That is the only way to have it. You can't go wrong with the fries. I do not recommend the hot dogs. I also feel the prices are on the high side. Those two reasons are why I gave them 4 stars. Service is really good and I love the freestyle coke dispenser."}
{"text":"The burgers here are really good, but ordering a whole meal with the fries and drink is just overpriced for something that's only good. I would have rather gone to Fatburger and paid the same price, but at least I would have enjoyed it a lot more."}
{"text":"Looking for a quality burger at a good price and quick service? 

Sometimes you want these qualities without doing the drive thru thing and love this place for that reason + they have the best Cajun fries mmmmm

I always get the mini cheeseburger cause the regular is a little large for me. They offer lots of topping so you can keep it simple or load it all up with toppings like bacon, jalape√±os, onions, pickles, egg, etc 

Small restaurant but still a good amount of seating along with patio seating 

They offer free peanuts and have a cute red and white checkered interior."}
{"text":"Always amazing customer service  consistently clean too. We don't go out often but but the two times we have been here we love and appreciate the hospitality!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten at Five Guys once before, a couple of years ago in Florida. I left there thinking that the food and the place was really greasy. I guess I have to give them a point for consistency. As soon as I walked into the Ajax location today, the air was heavy with oil and the floor was a bit slippery (it was humid outside but not raining, yet).

I ordered a bacon burger, medium sized Cajun fries, and a regular sized drink. The total was $17.60. Hmmm, that seems kinda expensive. I was asked what toppings I would like on my burger. Wow, lots of choices, and no extra charge. Okay.

I walked over to the Pick-Up counter to wait for my order number to be called. Hey, they have a box of peanuts in the shell and a scoop to help yourself. Okay. As much as I appreciated this, I did find it a little odd to have peanuts available, especially in an open container accessible by anybody in the restaurant. Don't they have any concerns about allergies?

The burger tasted pretty decent, albeit a bit greasy. The fries were nicely seasoned but a little soggy (greasy). There's a reason they stuff a handful of napkins in the bag. Unless you really LOVE potatoes, there's probably no need to order more than a small sized fries. The serving was generous. Considering the amount of fries, unlimited toppings at no extra charge, and free drink refills, it doesn't seem as expensive anymore.

It is worth mentioning that the crew of this location worked like a well oiled (pardon the pun) machine! It got really busy while I was there and their communication with each other and sharing of responsibilities was very obvious. And they all did it with a smile!

Unfortunately, because of the greasy environment and food, I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Great guilty pleasure food! The hamburgers are great and this time I tried a dog and was not disappointed.

Look, there nothing healthy on the menu and sometimes that's just what a girl needs!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this business and the service they provide. Five guys is where you go if you want a delicious burger... Plain and simple. 

They use Idaho potatoes for their fries and also carry Cajun style fries which hit the spot. It's higher end quality fast food, their burgers all have free toppings and a sesame seed bun. 

Taste wise it's the ideal cookout burger. Customized with what you want and juicy as it is packed with flavor. 

Very clean as it is at all their venues. Staff is kind and cool. Peanuts are always available while you wait.

They are not trying to be fancy they know what they do and they do it right. for  Quality burgers and fries go to Five guys."}
{"text":"The Guys gets 5 clams any day of the week. Talmbout juicy sliders, with all the fixings. Talmbout free peanuts. Talmbout a meal that's gonna make you break up with your girlfriend. Talmbout a burger that's gonna wanna make you wanna hit the next person who says the words \"hamburger\" to you over the head with a gold brick. I'll eat the guys for breakfast, lunch, and if need be, dinner. Put some hair on your chest. Grab a slider from The Guys. I personally recommend lite mayo, lite pickles, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, and BBQ. The Guys.

5/5 clams - TV"}
{"text":"Perhaps the stars were aligned, perhaps it was exactly what I wanted or it was just that good!  I decided to come to Five Guys in Market Square after work because I had an insatiable craving for a burger, but not just any burger - I didn't want a froo froo ultra fancy burger that came from a cow named \"Franc\"...I was in the mood for your all American standard burger but higher quality then your local fast food joint.

Man did I come to the right place!  I ordered the little cheeseburger and little fries (cajun style) to go along with it and it was soooo good.  The place is clean and organized and although there wasn't a crowd since I was coming after work, they were very efficient so I can see how this place runs smoothly during the busy lunch hour.

I got lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, jalapenos and bbq sauce on my burger and all the veggies were fresh and the mushrooms were perfectly sauted.  It should be noted that the jalapenos are fresh not the pickled kind for thos folks that might be particular.  What can I say - everything was perfect and I couldn't imagine getting a regular sized burger.  I barely had room for the fresh and tasty fries!"}
{"text":"Five Guys burgers are always great, they just hit the spot for me. 

This Five Guys in particular seemed to be staffed with some unusually friendly, helpful and customer service oriented people. Felt like a Chik-Fil-A but less forced! 

It's on my way home from the airport and they sold me for repeat visits in the future!"}
{"text":"One star for the burger- a bacon double cheese burger and it was juicy and tasty and a fair size. Another star for the restaurant- nice clean and fairly quick service (went on New Year's Day so it wasn't packed). But I docked a few stars for value. Just for the burger itself it ran about $7-8 and everything has to ordered separate no meals or combos. We ordered 2 dbl cheeseburgers. 1 large fry and 1drink and a grilled cheese ($5 just the sandwich) and our bill was $30+. I could've ate a Applebee's and got a dessert also. The fries were fresh but was way to salty! ask for no or light salt. Grilled cheese was like the ones I could make at home nothing fancy. Like I said burgers were good but in&out still beats it lol. If I were to come back again I'd skip all the sides and drinks (I'd just bring a bottle water) and get just the burger..."}
{"text":"Need a tasty, juicy all-beef burger? Five Guys serves up a modestly-priced single-patty sandwich with as many fixings as you want from a wide assortment; I had mine with saut√©ed mushrooms and onions, and total came to $6.18 with tax."}
{"text":"Five Guys Burgers is an OK place.  I stopped here with four friends after being at Red Rock Canyon.  I have never been to a Five Guys and I didn't know what to expect.  The four people I was with had all been there and were fans.

They explained that the regular was a double patty so I ordered the \"little\" bacon cheeseburger.  I got my burger with lettuce, jalape√±os, and grilled mushrooms.
The people I was with took care of ordering two medium fries for the five of us and that was plenty.

The burger was a nondescript piece of cooked, ground beef.   There was one half of a piece of lettuce that was only partly on the patty.  There were no mushrooms that I could see anywhere.  The bacon was crumbled pieces of bacon on the bottom bun under the burger, not the more common bacon slices you'd get at most places.

The fries were good. I liked the amount of salt they used.  Had I been ordering for myself, I would have ordered cajun fries but alas I wasn't.

The fact that they have free peanuts to snack on before the burger comes or after or to take a bag home with you didn't phase me at all.  I think I had three peanuts and that was good enough.

The place doesn't deserve a 2 star rating but I really hate to round it to three.  The fries will push it to a three.  Let's just say it's not a place to which I'd return!  Also, the music was BLARING!  It was awful!!!"}
{"text":"Like any other Five Guys - burgers are a-ok, however, fries are outta this world. I feel like I just need to go there to get fries all the time and not the burger. What's amazing about the fries? Cajun style. Delicious.

Also, it's even better when they give you a cup full of fries, and just dump a bunch more into the bag for you for a delicious heart-attack."}
{"text":"We have become fans of Five Guys Burgers.  Tonight, I got a cheeseburger and fries for my wife because I was going to the Strip for dinner.  I ordered online for the first time because this new outlet is so close to my house.

I left a bit early and it was good.  Downtown Summerlin is still going through the opening weekend and the number of cars trying to get in was huge.  I was forced by Metro to drive around.  I wanted to give him a finger salute but I thought better of it!

It was worth the extra time.  I arrived at Five Guys at the time I had said I would pick up the burger and they were just finishing up.  The place was slammed and there must have been 12 employees behind the counter.  Even with all the people in the restaurant, there was no line and the employees were efficient and knew what they were doing.  There must have been some good pre-opening training!!

My wife reports that everything was very good.  I'm sure we'll be there more often as things quiet down a bit.

Welcome to the neighborhood, Five Guys!"}
{"text":"Finally an able competitor to IN & OUT burger! The burgers are a good size and come with all the toppings you would ever want. Their sweet Potato fries are delicious and the portion is soo big that I can usually convince a friend to order them and then steal 1/2 of theirs :) 

Despite this place being busy during lunch, they usually have my order ready within 5-10 minutes. 

I still like IN & OUT burgers better but this place gives it a run for the money."}
{"text":"Cajun fries! Cajun fries! Cajun Fries! 
Five Guys is now across the 49th parallel and in Canada. 
They have a great 1950's hamburger joint type feel to the restaurant. Order a burger to the way you like it with as many of the free toppings that you would like. Next up, are their hand cut fries. Always cut fresh and deep fried just right to be crispy on the outside. They use peanut oil for frying - so be forewarned. 

Oh yah, make sure you order Cajun fries!"}
{"text":"Great location inside the mall. Very quick energetic employees. Place seemed a little dirty around the soda area. Could use a cleaning when your that busy. But our cheeseburgers were amazing. Good job everyone!"}
{"text":"Five Guys Burgers and Fries is one of the best burger joints in Las Vegas. There food is quality and always fresh! The french fries are great and they fill the bottom of the bag with them. Great service and fresh tasty food. They are a little pricey but the food is quality, So I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Ok, amidst all the hype, we finally got over to this place to try it out. It was very anti-climactic. 
The burger itself has no taste, it relies on the free toppings to carry the flavor. The fries are fresh cut and plentiful, but pretty heavy on the grease factor. 
You need a mouth like Guy Fieri's to be able to eat a regular burger which is 2 patties, I had the \"little cheeseburger\" - one patty. 
I'm sorry to say this but if you like flavor, I'd recommend Steak & Shake.
Also, the music is really loud so if you plan on conversation during lunch, this may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"Seems ran by 16 yr olds. Floor is dirty, tables dirty. Cannot tell if there is a manager or not. Most 5 guys you can tell who is a manager and they take charge. The kid cashier at least calls how many patties he sold. *update* I later asked cashier kid if i could get an aluminum pan or takeout pan because I forgot to order my meal as no bun. I might as well have asked him in Mandarin chinese. So when he went to ask someone something he was standing right by them. I went down and pointed them out. He goes \"oh a tin pan\". Yes genius. Find a synonym and use your brain a bit. 

He also had gloves on for order taking but was touch his nose and face. I hope at no point he touched food. Place lacks management and any knowledge of safe food service."}
{"text":"This is the third time my takeout order has been incorrect in the past two months. I called to tell them and the phone has been off the hook for 20 minutes. I have to drive back there to actually get what I ordered for the third time."}
{"text":"folks are getting caught in the hype, cashier says the patties are 4.0oz a former employee told me they are no more than 3.7oz. and they weigh they to make sure all this is pre-cook. Huge pricing difference in Canada, single patty in the US is $2.99 up here they are $5.12? Why !! is our hamburger that much more expensive?

Me and a buddy had lunch, 2 double patties, small fries, and (2) regular size drinks =$27.00 for two. I don't care how good they might be this is rip-off pricing.

Buyer beware!!

{"text":"Not great, not awful.  I just wasn't terribly impressed.... everyone keeps telling me how great their fries are but I didn't think they were anything special.   They do give you a TON of them.... my husband and I split a large order of the Cajun fries and only finished about 1/3 of what they gave us.    
I did appreciate the large array of toppings available to customize the burger to your liking, especially fresh jalapenos.  Next time I'll skip the fries and stick to the single burger, which for a \"fast food\" burger was pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"I like this place! A solid choice for a good burger ;) Great service with friendly faces! No complaints here."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever complained about price in a review, but $12.54 for a fast food cheeseburger, fries, and a medium drink?  The burger was ok and the fries were pretty good. Probably won't be back. Too many better choices out there (Lobby's, Zipps, Macs, 4Peaks, and of course the greatest of all The Chuck Box)."}
{"text":"While I generally don't like chain food, five guys is just really good. The burgers are always tasty and fresh and they really nail the fries. Whoever thinks BK or McDonalds is in the same league as five guys has completely lost it. The one bad thing about five guys is the super bright lighting...makes it feel a little too much like a cafeteria."}
{"text":"A good friend suggested to try these \"wonderful\" and healthy burghers. This was one of the wors burgher experience I ever ate.I ordered a burgher with bakon and a cheeseburgher.  It was too wet, the bun was like a wet napkin and it didn't have any taste. Both were a big dissapointment. The fries were over fried."}
{"text":"This location I am currently sitting in is super super hot!  It's nicer outside then it is inside!  Personal opinion this is crazy!  It's unbearable to even sit.  Not coming here again."}
{"text":"Words cannot adequately describe how incredibly awesome these burgers are! I've eaten plenty of burgers in my lifetime so I mean it when I say these ones rank among the greatest I have ever had. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger (with two patties). One bite and I couldn't believe something so wonderful had graced my taste buds. The restaurant was also clean and the employees were nice. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The burger was tasty but the patties were a little under-seasoned which i guess is ok since you're likely to reach your unhealthy food quota for the day anyway.

I think the place is ok so I'll just write some tips:

1. Their regular burger = 2 patties, the little burger is what all of us mortals would call a regular

2. The fries are not all that you'd think. Again, a small is plenty and it comes superfluously in a paper cup inside a paper bag.

3. You can help yourself to peanuts which seems like a nice addition."}
{"text":"I expected more of these burgers. We ended up here because they were the only ones open on Sunday around that area (excluding McDonald's of course)... When in Canada, do as Canadians... They should have poutine on their menu!! Two thumbs up for the variety on their toppings, I really liked that... Regular tasting fries and really didn't understand the peanut thing... I certainly don't crave peanuts with my burgers...ever... that only makes the place look dirty.
Anyways, I really thought they would be amazing I guess they are just average."}
{"text":"We ate here a couple of nights ago. Considering it was our first time, it was pretty good. The burgers weren't greasy, like most places. Their fries are always good. Just a note, even though we are fans of spicy food, the Cajun french fries had quite a bit of a kick to them. The place was clean (even though we carried out food to go). The free peanuts take you back to your childhood!!! The staff was nice and the prices, meh, could be a bit cheaper. Overall we would visit again."}
{"text":"This place seems like a big kitchen to me.    I guess it's the plain white tiled walls and floor.  It's clean an neat.  What I love about this place is their complimentary peanuts.  They were tasty and they also helped to kill the time before my burger was ready.  Actually they were so tasty that it was hard to stop tho.  I had the little burger with one patty.  Guess they didn't sear the bun and it was kind of soggy....... the patty was kind of dry.  Fries were pretty good.  Staffs were very friendly.  The guy shouted \"goodbye\" from the kitchen when we left : )"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this five guy location since college. While the food is similar to other locations the crowd is always interesting. College students, people visiting the hospitals, and random sketchy people. It's typically messy and crowded. I do enjoy their burgers and fries though!"}

{"text":"This place provides very tasty burgers and fries.  The burgers are not very fancy and the ingredients are fresh.

The only issue I have with this place is that it is very loud.  They shout at everyone coming into the door.  I really do not like the atmosphere but the food is good."}
{"text":"This one is an easy one for me.  A solid meh.  

The Burger itself is so so.  A little overpriced in my opinion.  It's not great, it's not bad.  It just is.  The fries were either too soggy or too crunchy.  Complinetary peanuts do nothing for me unless I am at a bar.  The decor is pretty cheesy.  White with red accents and the music is too loud.  I could barely hear my number being called.  

All in all I wish a Fatburger had gone into this location instead."}
{"text":"Five Guys Burger and Fries... you have alot of explaining to do. 

You charged us $20 for:
-2 Ice teas (not fresh brewed)
-1 regular fries
-1 burger 
-1 hotdog. 

If I was sitting down to a baseball game I might be able to excuse the price-gouging and the crap quality.... but since I wasn't, WHAT GIVES?

Somehow between picking our greasy brown paper sack up from the counter to sitting down 10 feet away-- my hot dog had miles for wear. It didn't have all the toppings I ordered and it was tightly bound in foil. The hot dog was cut in half and cooked to the point of being dried out at the ends. It was not blackened or charred at all-- I mean it looked like a dark red hot dog chip. I was literally able to snap off the very tip. Maybe the wet soggy bun was meant to help rehydrate it? I dunno. 

My husband said that his burger was decent-- if it wasn't $7. 

Fries were good-- and plentiful. Ambiance was no-frills red white w/ peanut shells all over the floor (from the big ugly boxes of peanuts that you can help urself to...). 

In a town w/ In&Outs and Cheeburgers Cheeburgers, 5 Guys... 

You've got alot of nerve."}
{"text":"Is there anyone that doesn't like Five Guys? Seriously?

I'll admit, the selections are a little limited and there's really no options for vegetarians other than the fries or peanuts, but this isn't for vegetarians--this is for big, greasy meat-eaters who like their meat.

I love Five Guys. I love meat. And I love sometimes clogging my arteries."}
{"text":"So, being from California, I have to compare this to in-n-out. It's right about the same. I got 2 cheese burgers with diff toppings, mushrooms, onions, and peppers. They were fantastic. They have an 'everything' style that seems just, over the top. 

If I saw one while driving down the freeway and I was hungry, I'd pull over. But, if there was an in-n-out or white castle (haven't tried) I'd go to one of those. 

I've already read that their french fries are one of the most UNHEALTHY food items someone can order in america. :( (they were good tho, :)  )."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Best burgers and they even have low carb style without the bun just ask for extra lettuce and a knife and fork because it's messy but worth it"}
{"text":"Normally I would have better news for this place, but after the past 2-3 times of dining here... I have been disappointed multiple times.

D√©cor: It sits inside the food court, lower level of the mall. Typical 5 guys, but the plus side is that they have outdoor seating. It really helps to get out of the loud yelling inside the mall. 

Food: This is where I have mixed reviews. The burgers---- Overall they're not too bad. They usually taste super greasy here, and I always have a stomach ache after. I can really only have the \"little\" and not feel too bad. The positive side is that they load the toppings on, and they're free. Can't fight with free. The \"dog\"---- Do not get the hotdog, especially the cheese and bacon dog. It was just American sliced cheese melted on a hotdog, horrible. The fries--- Ok, when you boast about having the best fries, you need to back it up. Every single time I come in, they are soggy, greasy, and undercooked. I shouldn't see solid potato inside the fries. It should be white throughout, and crispy. I have had limp, sad looking fries everytime.

Overall: For the insane amount of money they charge for a meal, I would highly recommend going someplace else. The staff here have no passion about what they're doing, and it really shows. Hopefully they will do something to change, but by the lack of responses on here, I doubt it."}
{"text":"What is there to say? The burgers are consistent, the staff is friendly. I do feel like I can only come here once a month though (or if I'm really really hungover). If someone tried to tell me the amount of calories in a double cheese burger with fries I would probably cover my ears and run."}
{"text":"Just okay burger. Meat has no flavor. Yes, there are lots of toppings. Amount of fries is absurd."}
{"text":"No shakes of any kind??  At least they have the popular ice tea machine almost everyone hazzzz.

Came here with a friend who wanted to compare this location with that from Washington which she visited over the summer.

The experience was alright, the patties are doubled which makes the portion aight and the fries in the bag was greased up and over seasoned.  But as you walk in and make your way to the left, you'll see bags of peanuts and a open bag of peanuts which you can scoop up and enjoy some.  

Here's a pro tip:  Dump the fries in the bag and roll the bag down so you can easily pick one up.

OOORDDDDERRRR NUMMBBBERRR TTHHHIIRRRTTYYYY!!!!!! (yelling.. lol)"}
{"text":"\" Good Food, But a Little Over Priced \"

My wife and I went to Five Guys Burgers and Fries with some friends last week, and had some nice tasty food. I had the Bacon Cheeseburger with Cajun Style Fries, and my wife had the Kosher Style Hot Dog, with Five Guys Style Fries. I ordered my Cheeseburger with extra sauce on it, but it was still a little dry. The Cajun Fries were delicious. My wife's Hot Dog and fries were also very good. Very clean Restaurant, but the noise level was very high, and it was only half full of people. I felt the Burgers and Hot Dogs were a little over priced for what you get, but the meals were very tasty."}
{"text":"Short & sweet today folks!  Want a meal that won't bust your budget but not leave you feeling hungry?  You like lots and lots of choices?  You like free roasted peanuts?  Then take your grubby hands over to Five Guys Burgers and Fries!

Seriously, a cheap meal to be had!  But oh, the possibilities!  Going here reminds me of going to a classic diner with all the red and white inside.  Place is pretty clean, and damn that smell of fresh burgers and fries is intoxicating.  I go here when McDonald's or Burger King just don't do it for me.  

Menu is simple, you got your burgers, your dogs, your sandwiches, and your fries.  Oh yeah, and they serve Coca-Cola!  Rejoice!  Alright, today we'll just focus on their specialty, the burgers.  Five Guys has several offerings, hamburger, cheeseburger, bacon burger, bacon cheeseburger, as well as a 'little' option for the above mentioned burgers.  The little burgers offer one meat patty instead of the regular size two patties that come on each of Five Guys' burgers.  I'm a big dude, but I usually opt for the little cheeseburger because I like lots of fixings on my burger.  Plus, it's cheaper!  No joke, I'm a bit of a cheapy...except on health insurance and collectible toys.

Don't get me started on the free toppings that you can include on your burger, I go nuts!  My burger always comes out HEAVY because of the stuff I add to my burger.  If you're a purist, you won't like me.  I like colors when I eat!  Anyway, free toppings include:

-Mayo
-Mustard
-Ketchup
-Lettuce
-Tomatoes
-Pickles
-Onions
-Relish
-Grilled Onions
-Grilled Mushrooms
-Jalapenos
-Green Peppers
-A1
-BBQ Sauce
-Hot Sauce

As many as you want, on your burger.  Now I haven't seen anyone get all of them on a burger yet but here's what I like on mine, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, mayo, BBQ sauce, A1, and a touch of hot sauce.  Killer!  But I'll just as easily go lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, mayo, mustard, and ketchup to keep my cheeseburger classy.

Fries here are good, but I always get them well-done.  I just like em' super crispy and not so soggy.  I like the cajun style fries too, nice and spicy.  They come in two sizes, small and LARGE.  Go for the large, so you can share!  Or be a wee lil' piggy like me and keep them all for yourself.  Don't forget your drink!  Get one because their fabuloso Coca-Cola machine is from the future!  Use the touch screen to try over 100 drink options or create one of your own!  For some reason I always stick with a Diet Cherry Coke.  Hey, don't judge!

While you are waiting for your order don't forget to get messy with a dish of their roasted peanuts.  Can't miss the huge bags sitting there on the way to the counter.  Ask your server for some.  They're free!  I can't tell you how much I don't mind free food.  If you're nice, sometimes they'll let you take a bag of peanuts home with you.

The taste?  On par with other specialty burger places like In N Out and Smashburger.  It's not uber gourmet, but it's hot, fresh, and efficient.  Nothing artificial, nothing sitting under a heat lamp, and nothing microwaved.  It's a decent meal for a decent price.  For two people, you can get a couple of loaded little cheeseburgers, large fries, and a large drink to share for around $15!  That's not bad for a date night!  Bad Economy - 0, You - 1."}
{"text":"Dang, Downtown Summerlin, looks like you got everything!

This Five Guys is basically the same as all the other Five Guys franchises around town.  Luckily, the ones I've been to have good food and good service.  This one is thankfully no different.  Tasty & greasy!  Just the way I like it!  Every once is a while anyway.

The Five Guys here in the new Downtown Summerlin looks just like the other ones inside.  Lot of red, lots of white, lots of black. lots of checkerboard, and lots and lots of boxes of roasted peanuts!  This is one of the pluses when I visit, I can gorge on some all natural, unsalted peanuts.  For free!  Only thing that beats this is a bucket of BOILED peanuts (you Asians know what I mean).

My order is very standard when I come to Five Guys:

-Little Cheeseburger
-Add : lettuce, tomato, pickle, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, mayo, mustard, sometimes A1, sometimes BBQ sauce
-One order of LARGE fries to share, with TONS of ketchup and malt vinegar for dipping
-One large drink to share (thank you Coca-Cola Freestyle!)

Little burger always comes out STACKED!  Yes, I know it's too many toppings, and yes, I know it probably masks the taste of my cheeseburger (it really does not).  But I don't care!  It's my way!  I want it jacked!  Besides, we all need some color in our diet sometimes, am I right?  Forget about the oil-stained bag that arrives in front of you.  It's delicious!  Besides, they use peanut oil anyway, which is actually good for you.  

Verdict?  Just like all the other Five Guys.  Yummy, thankfully!  This is a meal fit for a guy on a budget.  Fills you up for hours!  Seriously.  If you're still hungry after a burger and fries here you either ordered wrong, or you are a competitive eater.  Good American eats.  Messy.  Primal even.

Nothing new going on here at Five Guys, but at least they're doing it right.  

GREASE = PEACE (or something like that)"}
{"text":"It's too bad Create (another decent burger place) had to close, and another Five Guys pops up in its place.  But luckily, I don't mind Five Guys!  Now this one is SUPER CLOSE to my home, a five minute drive away.  When I'm feelin' greasy cheesy...I can head over to this Five Guys for a fix!

This Five Guys is just like every other Five Guys here in Vegas.  Burgers.  Fries.  Free peanuts.  And that damn cool Coca Cola machine (which is more like a robot) that serves umpteenthousand combinations of your favorite sodas and soft drinks.  I like it!

Yes, Five Guys remarkable reminds one of another great burger joint in Vegas, In N Out Burger.  While the premise is similar, the reality is far different.  I love, love, love In N Out (UNLV memories abound) but Five Guys brings in a beacon of change!  You can eat hearty for a measly pennance.  If you leave here NOT full, it's totally your fault.

The menu is pretty straight forward with burgers, cheeseburgers, bacon burgers, and bacon cheeseburgers.  Burgers come standard at close to a half pound, or you can opt for you burger in 'little' which comes in closer to a quarter pound.  Either way, with your toppings your possibilities are almost ENDLESS!  You can create about 250,000 combinations with the choices of free toppings offered:

-Mayo
-Lettuce
-Pickles
-Tomatoes
-Grilled onions/regular onions
-Grilled mushrooms
-Ketchup
-Mustard
-Relish
-Jalapeno
-Green peppers
-A1
-BBQ sauce
-Hot sauce

You like change?  Go for it!  The world is your oyster.  I personally love grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mayo, and A1 on mine!  Flavor city my friends.  Some folks are purists and love just meat, cheese, bun, mayo, mustard, and ketchup.  But folks like me go all out and do a little bit of everything.  Luckily the burgers aren't frozen but fresh, and grilled right in front of you.  So they taste pretty damn good!  Burgers here don't come with fries so don't forget to order a large cup of these hand-cut beauties.  I really do like the cajun style, and they are great to dip in malt vinegar!  But ketchup will do as well.  And while you're waiting for your order, don't forget to grab a tray of free roasted peanuts for snacking!  Do like some folks and take an entire paper bag home!  

With a burger, fries, and a regular drink, depending on your burger and the size of your fries and drink, it will set you back around $9.  Nope, not the cheapest by any means but still change for what you're getting.  This burger could probably count for 2 meals if you really wanted it to (I particularly don't because I'm a piggy).  And compared to a night at a Gordon Ramsay pub?  A steal!

Five Guys also does hot dogs and a few sandwiches like a grilled cheese and a BLT.  But I say stick with the burgers for a sure thing.  

Service here is always quick, but I never feel rushed especially when I decide all those toppings I want on my burger.  The wait is not usually long except maybe during some lunch rush hours.  I hungrily anticipate that brown paper bag with the oil stain just seeping through the paper.  Goodness ensues!  And a run on the treadmill too."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. This place seemed a little empty on a Saturday evening, but that just means less of a line. The prices do seem a little high here for burgers (but they are double patty so maybe it is justified), but just a bacon cheeseburger came out to around $9. There were plenty of available peanuts, as per usual and the cajun fries were tasty (also as per usual).

For our order, they completely messed it up and still addd mustard and forgot to put in grilled mushrooms and onions, but that's no big deal. This is just a regular old chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Still pricey. Still a good burger. 

One cool change...the super slick new digital coke machine. There are about 40 sodas to choose from! Pretty fun. For example, if you select sprite zero, you can then choose raspberry, strawberry, peach, grape, cherry, classic and so on! Fun!

Note to diners! I had forgotten.  The regular burger is really a double patty and the little is a single patty.  

Another nice touch, five guys numbers your burgers along with your order on your receipt, so you don't have to dissect them to figure oput whos is whos.  Cool!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about the one Five Guys I tried in the US. And I was really hoping to rave about this one as well. What a fail. Here's five reasons why: 

1. Way more expensive than the American chain. I remember paying about $5-6 bucks for my little hamburger and fries. I paid almost double here - about $11 bucks. 

2. The burger patty wasn't bad, but wasn't as good as I remembered the American one to be.

3. Fries were tasteless. Meh. 

4. Drink selection was disappointing. One of the cool features at the American chains, especially for the kid in my boyfriend, is the 100+ drink selection machine. At this location, we had about 6. 

5. They cheaped out on my toppings. I asked for grilled mushrooms and found two slices on one side of the bun. Terrible. My American burger was LOADED with mushrooms. 

This place still gets 3 stars, because in all honesty, the burger is still better than the usual food chain find. And they do load up on the fries. Small is good enough for 2 people. 

One of the other reasons I am giving it 3 stars is because my boyfriend feels that I am not being fair with this review. He quite liked it (and he's tried the US one as well)."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys in general and this location is no exception.  Great cheeseburgers and fries!  The customer service here was friendly as well.  Can't wait to come back, that is after I go to the gym for a few days ;)"}
{"text":"Well... It's a burger.
In N Out is faster and better tasting.
Also the soda machine is not my cup o tea lol."}
{"text":"Five guys makes a great burger. Same style you could make at home if you had the time and stuff and didn't mind a mess.

I give it three stars for two reasons, the price tag is simply too high for size and quality of the burgers. The fries are huge and I love the seasoning option, but they are always woefully undercooked floppy and greasy. 

The free in she'll peanuts are just strange to me, and the shells end up all over everything giving the impression its dirtier than it really is.

If you're looking for a tasty burger and don't have time for a restaurant, give it a shot. Just not what I think it should be, especially given the hype it receives."}
{"text":"I love 5 guys burgers.....or at least i used to. I visited the power rd. location.
They have raised their prices to epic heights and i have eaten there for the last time..
2 cheeseburgers, 2 fries, 2 drinks.... 30.00 insane!!
I have even heard national radio shows talk about how nutz their prices are.
Sorry guys...the dollars dont make sense anymore and your prices are higher than a sit down restaurant.  We eat at Freddies steakburgers for 14.50..... 1/2 the price!!!
Venezias pizza : 13.95 for 4 huge slices/ toppings and 2 endless drinks.
WHERE's the value in 5 guys with their fresh only ingredients, simple store and peanuts??  I see nothing but record profits!"}
{"text":"Great burgers.....great fries....absolutely insane prices!
I stopped  going to Five Guys for this reason.
Dang near 30.00 for 2 burgers,fries and cokes !!
So many better deals out there.
Wake up America!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and epic fries but their prices are ridiculous!!!
30.00 for two adults?? Never again
Venezias pizza- 13.95 four slices with topping, cokes
Freddys steak burgers 14.00
Babbo italian- 2 spag.& meatballs, wine, , coke and endless awesome bread. 25.00 with tip!!
Sorry 5 guys...i'm done !"}
{"text":"Great food..... Ridiculous prices.....i cant in my right mind fork over 30.00 for 2 adults to eat at a fast food joint.
Sorry 5 guys..... I'm out and eating elsewhere .."}
{"text":"Wasn't overly impressed especially considering the price! We ordered two \"little burgers\" and one regular cheeseburger, one order of fries to share, and two bottles of water. Total came to just over $30. The fries came in a small cup (pictured here) which were definitely not shareable. 

As for taste, burgers and fries were good but nothing overly special and they use processed cheese. Presentation was a bit of a turn off - looked like the burgers were manhandled before they wrapped them! 

I like that they offer peanuts in the shell to snack on while you wait - though we didn't wait long at all. 

Bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Simply the best burgers and fries! Newmarket needed some better options for good burgers, now I don't want to go anywhere else. Burgers are fresh made with any toppings included. Fries are fresh cut with very generous portions - regular size will feed two just fine. I had heard portions were very large so I found it very helpful to let them know it was my first time. They explained everything and suggested sizes and it was just right. I also love the free peanuts to munch on while you're waiting for your order. Great quality burger, cooked perfectly, with the best tasting fries I've had. No need to look any further for a fresh and fast burger and real fries, this place is it!"}
{"text":"What a waste of $20. Seriously?! This place caught my eye because its only 2 miles from my house, and the area really needs a good burger place. In my husband's words, \"If you've ever eaten a Wendy's burger, you've already been here\". For $5.99 for a burger (yikes!) and $2.99 for fries I was expecting at LEAST In-N-Out or SmashBuger quality. Dry, small, and just....lacking flavor. 

Wayyyyy too loud music, you literally have to yell to give your order or talk while you sit and eat. Not going to start on their horrible lighting. Surface of the sun anyone?!

 Their burgers are made to order....right?  You tell them the toppings you want. I'm simple. Ketchup, Mustard, Lettuce. .....and they STILL got it WRONG. With 13 ...YES, THIRTEEN people behind the counter they still managed to mess up my order. When I see the tomatoes, (which I did not order, and made a point to tell them I was allergic to) they roll their eyes, take 10 mins to remake it, without an apology. 

$20 for 2 burgers and 1 Fry and 1 Small Drink is not bad if it was AMAZING or in a nice restaurant, but for a fast food type of place, they need In-N-Out prices. 

No Military Discount either :("}
{"text":"This was my first time at any of these locations. It's a cute little schtick they've got going on - free scoops of peanuts in the shell to munch on while you're waiting in line or for your food. I was surprised to see this, as the sign they have (a much needed allergy warning) is located below the mid point of the front door and so not very visible/obvious (people, seriously, suck it up, move the Five Guys sign off of one of the doors and have the warning at adult eye level, please. This is an issue that can very easily be life or death for many people, so please don't mess with it. I tend to think highly of a company who goes above the minimum legal requirement when it comes to caring for their customers. Now to the food - be aware, their \"regular\" burger is two patties. Yeah, clearly an American company because nowhere (except maybe in a pms, need red meat and chocolate moment) is that considered \"regular\" in my world. Anyway, the staff are friendly, the menu board is pretty clear and straight forward. We each ordered a \"small\" i.e. regular, one patty burgers and got to choose our toppings (free sauteed mushrooms). We decided not to order drinks or fries and just focus on the burger. They give you a number, and you sit and wait, we grabbed some peanuts and munched while we waited. They finally called our number and we got our burgers. They toast the buns, and the buns are like the ones I remember from my childhood (puffy with the sesame seeds on top), they toast them. The burger was okay, tender, but I wish they hadn't put so much A1 sauce on my burger because that's ALL I could taste. Too bad, because the meat seemed juicy but I didn't enjoy it as much as I might have. It would be helpful if they had something next to the tables/little sweepers to get the pieces of peanut shell off the table. Do we sweep em onto the floor? Use our napkins? Is this one of those places they want us to throw the shells on the floor, the floors weren't that clean and already had shells scattered her eand there so it's possible...so the burgers are okay but not cheap, I like that you can add as many (free) toppings as you like. I'd go back one more time to see if the burger was any more satisfying/to munch on free peanuts, but we have A LOT of fantastic burger places in Toronto, am not likely to spend my money on a U.S. chain's so/so burger, ya know?"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the great hot dog place I would definitely recommend Five Guys. They also carry burgers and fries with free peanuts. Store location was neat and clean. A little disappointed with the wait time though. After placing my order which I was the first in line and there was nobody else behind me, it took me 19 minutes to get my food, not only that they did not make the shake that I ordered till I brought to their attention. I was in no rush so this was something that I could wait for only thing that stopped me from giving them a five-star."}
{"text":"I've had burgers at many Five Guys locations but eat at this one most often. These guys and gals know burgers and fries like no other. They have pretty mean hot dogs as well. With a great seletion of toppings which are included with the price you can customize to suit anyone's taste. The fries vary from day to day to the random farms they come from. I suggest trying the Cajun spice give the fries a little kick...!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite healthy \"fast food\" joint around. My kids are gluten and dairy free and they are so careful about making sure the food is acceptable to them. As soon as we tell them we have an allergy they are right on changing their gloves and cleaning the counters right away. My kids don't get soda often, it's a real treat when they do and the Coke machines are so versatile it's very fun for them and us to choose what we are getting to drink for our visit
The only thing I wish they would do differently is offer some gluten free bread options, but it's not the end of the world to go bread free at Five Guys because they do offer the burger in a bowl or with a lettuce wrap. My son prefers the bacon dogs, and would love a nice gluten free dog bun. Maybe one day Five Guys?"}
{"text":"Loud music, bright lights, dirty sticky tables, and flavorless burger and fries does a good or even a remotely pleasant experience make. I feel like after that lunch I need to hide in a dark corner to recover from that over stimulation. But how can this be? I have been told over and over again how awesome the burger and fries are. They are not. There are too many other great dive bars to get an awesome burger and fries in Madison without getting the living day lights blasted out of your eardrums and eyeballs."}
{"text":"My first time here and im happy to report that I love this place. I had heard so many wonderful things about 5 Guys and everyone was right. Fresh tasty and perfectly yummy. The only issues I had as a newbie was the verbiage on the menu. A cheeseburger is actually a two patty burger which leads me to believe the mini cheeseburger is the single patty option. There are enough fries in a regular size (hey! that rhymes) to fill an ark so I wished I had purchased the smaller size. Despite the newbie confusion on the menu and the fact that all food is dumped in a bag even if you're dining in. I will definitely be back. Next time however, I'll make sure to get smaller portions."}
{"text":"Good food...hamburgers done right..peanuts a nice touch...lots of options...Staff friendly..BUT taste in music is just bad and too LOUD...I like to have a conversation with those I'm with without having to yell over bad loud \"music\" !  Best choice is take out and eat outside."}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple, the only reason you wouldn't like this place is because you lack the ability to be creative in creating the best burger for you....and only you!"}
{"text":"Five Guys is always good. I've never had a bad experience here; other than the time I asked for my burger in a lettuce wrap and the young woman manning the register asked me if I was a \"bread-a-tarian,\" which was unfortunate."}
{"text":"I stopped in for dinner at Strongsville five guys and ordered a burger on a lettuce wrap. An employee in a gray shirt delivered my food and then later returned and removed my trash. I felt very welcomed. Will definitely return and recommend your location!"}
{"text":"As someone who is from Virginia, I have been to a looooooot of Five Guys locations in my life. And it always gives me a warm fuzzy feeling to see a little piece of Virginia here in Arizona. If somehow you've never been... I highly recommend it.

Food: I love their burgers, though they are a bit greasy. A little bacon cheeseburger (little just means one patty instead of two) with lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, extra grilled mushrooms, green peppers, and bbq sauce. (My s/o only adds green peppers, jalapeno,  and bbq sauce and pays the same. Free toppings are my faaaave.) I used to get jalapenos on my burgers, but the jalapenos that they serve up here are fresher and spicier than the ones at the Five Guys back home, so now I only get them on occasion. The fry portions are HUGE, but their Cajun fries can't be beat. In my opinion, their large fries is enough for 3-4 people to share. My brother swears by their milkshakes, but I don't really like milkshakes, so I haven't had one. Also, if you've never dipped a fry in malt vinegar + ketchup, you should give it a try.  

Service: The service isn't the fastest here, even in comparison to other Five Guys locations, but I'll let that slide."}
{"text":"My favorite fast real burger spot. Your burger is made to order and fries are hot. Try the cajun style fries. There not to spicy, and you only need one regular size order for two people. 1 little burger 1 bacon cheese burger, 1 regular fry, and 2 regular drinks $12.42. My only complaint was that my bacon was cooked to hard. I hate crunchy bacon!"}
{"text":"Five Guys is burger comfort food bliss.  

Yes, they only have American cheese available, but like I said... they are not going for artisanal burgers.  Just damn good, hot, gooey, comforting, cholesterol-mainlining burgers.

A soft, sesame-seed bun is basically there just to keep the guts together, which is the way I like my burgers (and my pulled pork sandwiches).  I am not here for a 7-herb artisanal crusty baguette.  I am here for the burger.

The beef patties are flavorful and greasy and the toppings generous but appropriately portioned to the size of the sandwich.  When you order fries, you get a normal sized cup of fries and then another pound or so of fries thrown loose into your food bag.  A \"regular\" or small order of fries is enough for two people to split.  No individual has any business ordering the large.

Speaking of fries, the cajun fries are a favorite among my coworkers, but even the regular fries are great!  Some say the fries are better than the burgers, but that's just ridiculous... 

I agree with Angela.  If they served milkshakes, I'd have to exchange my wardrobe for one or two sizes bigger, and I'd have a seat with my name on it at Five Guys Burgers and Fries."}
{"text":"Food 3 stars.  Service +0.5 star.

I didn't order a hamburger.  I ordered a veggie sandwich, which came in an untoasted burger bun.  There was no veggie patty.  In its place were various vegetable toppings.  Veggies toppings that came without asking were grilled mushroom, grilled onion, grilled pepper, lettuce and tomatoes.  The cashier was generous and helpful.  He voluntarily told me that I could order as many toppings as I wanted.  So I added jalape√±o peppers and mustard.  The veggie sandwich was cheap at less than $4.  Even without cheese, I was pretty full. 

As mentioned, the staff was helpful.  The food took its time to be ready, but within reason (unlike burger priest).  The dining area was clean, but not spotless.  

I can't help but compare the veggie sandwich against the Harvey's veggie burger.  I like the Harvey's one better.  I like the cashier/staff here better.  But the price here can't be beat."}
{"text":"I've been to Five Guys on the east coast before, so I knew what to expect. The burgers are good, no doubt. The fries are soggy. They have a really great selection of toppings. You can order online and then just walk in and pick up your food without waiting in line (it worked perfectly for me, although, according to some of these reviews, other people had issues with it). Prices are decent. I'll be back, but I'm not about to wait in a line out the door for this burger (or any burger, for that matter)."}
{"text":"This 5 guys is just like any other one I've been too. Still, I felt compelled to rate them four stars. The staff has always been super friendly and helpful so no issues there. The issue I have had every time I've went to this one is the pop machine. Every single pop (5 of them) that I tried were bad. No flavor. Flat. Or no carbonation. The ketchup is always out as well. This is frustrating and I wish they could get runners for the upkeep. Still a delicious place for burgers and fries though."}
{"text":"I have to say I am a little picky when it comes to fast food burger places.  My husband had been to Five Guys many times and kept asking me to try it.  I finally agreed and was not disappointed.   They burgers are great.  Lean , fresh, meat, not frozen and most importantly NOT SALTY!!   Most burger places rain salt on their burgers, not so at Five Guys.   In fact I even asked for my burger \"not seasoned\" and the cashier explained they do not season their burgers.  You can get as much of any topping for no extra charge.   Customize it any way you like.   The orders always come out accurate.   Fries are great and always come out hot and fresh.   I have been here several times and will continue to go back.   Give them a try."}
{"text":"I got my burger all dressed and honestly i am not a big fan. It was fairly average tasting and messy. I think messy burgers are great when they taste good, was disappointed with this five guys. The fries were ok and no complaints on the service. When in the west i would still rather have a Harvey's burger for nearly have the price."}
{"text":"Not my most favorite burger place but not my least favorite either. 

The positives: The little burger is still plenty big for one adult hungry person. Love that you can choose what goes on the burger and the toppings are part of the price. The size of the french fries is very very generous.

The negatives: The grilled mushrooms look and taste like out of a jar. Please don't offer that on your menu if you cannot afford grilling fresh mushrooms. Its disgusting. Ruined my burger. 

Otherwise not a bad concept. Definitely not on the cheap side though. Quality could be better."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place forever.  Lots of people told me how great their burgers were so I had high hopes.  Unfortunately I don't think it lived up to the hype - but I still rate them A-OK with 3 stars.  First of all one single burger, one double burger, a large fries, and one drink came to almost $20.  Steep for a burger meal for two in my opinion.  Ok, the peanuts was a nice touch.  I loved that they are free and I enjoyed them.  I also loved the fancy Coke machines with lots of drink choices.  I really, really like when I have the option of more than just 5 sodas.  

Ok on to the food.  The burgers were overly dry.  They were severely overcooked.  At a \"gourmet\" burger joint I like to have the option of a medium cooked burger.  There is nothing I hate more than an overcooked burger.  I did like that there was a good choice of toppings including grilled onions and mushrooms.  The bacon on my burger was a little to dry and crumbly.  The buns are strangely crushed and looked really bad.  I wished I had a camera, but below here I see a burger bun that is exactly what I am talking about.  The fries were pretty terrible.  Soggy and really strangely cooked.  Half were brown and soggy.  The other half seemed to be cooked less.  It was almost like they were different batches of fries mixed together.  Needless to say the two of us only ate about half of the fries and tossed the rest.  I do like that they have both ketchup and vinegar.  I heard after that they had Cajun fries which I didn't notice on the menu board and were not suggested.  I would have ordered them if I had known.  Maybe next time.  One odd thing is that even though you say it's for there everyone gets their food in a bag.  I would have preferred a tray instead - it's just more convenient and less wasteful of packaging.  

The employees didn't seem really happy, but they were cordial.  Service was a little slow I'm guessing because they cooked the burgers too long.  It was not busy when we got there, but it picked up towards the end.  When we left the line was really long.  It seemed like they needed a couple more employees on hand at lunch time.  Without a coupon or discount it might a long time before I go back, but I would give them another try some day."}
{"text":"3/5 gluttonous

the burger is good. and by good, i mean it is fat-ful and greasy and loaded. you get to choose a bunch of toppings on it, then it comes with literally a cup of fries that's about 2 whole potatoes. yeah think about it.

anyways, it hits the spot though. and hard. you'll be comatose afterwards, but you know that sometimes this is exactly what you're looking for. be careful with the toppings though, you could accidentally mess up your burger (mustard and bbq sauce are not too great together). i like the fries though, and overall it's a very substantial meal.

the atmosphere is also fun, and i like the workers whenever i come by."}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical of Five Guys... and then I tried one while vacationing in San Diego and I was impressed with the flavor of the burger. I noticed the West Flamingo location of Five Guys was open when I was in the area last week, so a coworker an I decided to try a couple burgers to go for lunch Monday afternoon.

I went with the little cheese burger... which isn't really THAT little and when you add on a bunch of toppings, it's even bigger. I got mine with ketchup, mustard, lettuce, tomato, and grilled mushrooms... And it was messy messy messy. My advice is to eat it there, these don't seem to travel well.  The bun on mine was getting soggy from the juices.  We split an order of the regular friends. While plentiful, were nothing special. 

Overall, it was an a-ok burger. I think if I had eaten there, I would have given this location 4 stars but I just can't say I am a fan of soggy buns."}
{"text":"I would like to say thank you to Dan the manager at Five Guys Burgers and Fries in South Euclid. In response to my recent complaint Dan called me at home and reassured me about their food processes. He was very nice and very apologetic about what happened to us. He also personally came to my home to deliver a gift card to us so that we would come back as customers. He went above and beyond! I thought that was extremely great customer service and I appreciated it. I'm still on the fence as to if I'm going to go back to eat there and thats just the honest truth , I may give the gift card away, not sure yet. 
Cudos to Dan the manager from Five Guys for his customer relations/resolution he is the Best!!"}
{"text":"Heard nice things about Five Guys and tried to go while I was in Portland but didn't make it. I found out about the new location in Surprise and paid a visit. 
  I went on a Saturday about 12:30 which was probably a mistake. The place was packed and it took about 25 minutes to get my order. You could hardly hear the numbers called because of the music and crowd noise.
  The food tasted ok but is a bit messy to eat. It has good portions but I paid $13.13 for the bacon/ cheese burger with large fries, no drink, so it's a bit spendy. It's probably not a place I would go to again. In/out burger is quicker, cheaper and is not as messy to eat, so I'll stick with them in the future."}
{"text":"I love to destroy my daily calorie goals once in a while by going to this place. Great burgers with delicious Cajun fries."}
{"text":"For this location and all the others...has anyone ever received poor service.  I have yet to have a bad experience at a Five Guys, whether it's here or in California.  Kudos to Team Five Guys.

Now for their food:
-AYCE peanuts.  Service yourself
-Sodas: Love the soda machine.  Biggest selection if you're into all types of Coke products. 
-Bacon Cheeseburger:  Doesn't say on the menu, but it's a double. Fresh, juicy, and made exactly how you like it.   
-Fries:  I prefer steak fries, but these are just as good. By the way, order the regular size because they hook it up. 

This Five Guys is located right off the 15 and Craig.  Parking always abundant and the restuarant is clean.  Again, the service can't be beat.

Regarding the food, I am a fan.  I don't think it's expensive, but to an IN-N-Out it is. Had one of those burger weekends where I had a burger Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  This was my Saturday treat.  My only issue is that I wish this place had a drive thru."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a simple, tasty, made to order, drips down your hand cheeseburger this is the place! I've been here on a number of occasions, each time equally as delicious. I prefer Five Guys over In and Out, Fat Burger or the like. I like that it is simple but offers more variety then In and Out. 

Food Pros: Burgers are big, juicy and cheesy! All of their add ons including grilled onions and mushrooms are free. Plus they have bacon!  Everything is made to order but they are surprisingly prompt. They also have great natural cut french fries. I think they feature a different potato farmer every week. I also like that they have malt vinegar to go along with the fries, perfect combo! An added bonus is their futuristic soda dispenser. The first time I saw it I was in awe. You may find yourself standing there for 10 min just playing around with it. Peach Sprite is surprisingly delicious and refreshing!  The free peanuts while you wait is a nice touch as well

Cons: In the times I've been there it's always been what I've wanted and expected. 

Service: Good service, everything is made to order and they are prompt. Friendly cashiers and cooks. Fun atmosphere and clean. 

Overall if you're looking for a tasty, fresh, and cheesy burger with a side of awesome french fries then it is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I pass by this Five Guys on my way home from work. The staff is always very friendly. Best fries and it sill tastes great when I microwave the fries. I know this sounds strange. They have free peanuts you can get. With the hamburger you can choose any toppings. The hamburger is always fresh and hot. Only downfall is that Five Guys doesn't have too much options for vegetarian."}
{"text":"Have only eaten here once but my experience was awesome. Burger was best around and service was very quick and staff was friendly. This establishment is clean and I would recommend to anyone looking for good burger at average price."}
{"text":"Sometimes this spot just hits the spot, but most of the time I'd rather find a classic Quebec casse croute. The burgers are good, especially in my opinion when messy and piled with toppings, the fries are fresh, I've always found the service fast and friendly. The place is clean and convenient but the neon white glow of the lights drains my soul and there are much better greasy food experiences to be had elsewhere."}
{"text":"If I'm feeling like a burger with a little more substance than In-N-Out (at a higher cost of course), I go to Five Guys."}
{"text":"I'm not a big burger person, but I like how they make your burger to order. I love how they let you pick your toppings..a big plus for us. Their fries are amazing! Love the seasonings that they put on them. We always order the small fries and share as they give you so much!! 

This location is always so clean. Bathrooms are also clean and well stocked. Tables clean, and when someone leaves, one of the workers comes over and wipes it down."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Paid $12 bucks for a bacon cheesburger, fry and drink. Won't be doing that too often."}
{"text":"the best hamburgers in town, but the lady screaming every 10 seconds is annoying, please quiet!!!"}
{"text":"Since I work downtown, I decided to stop here for lunch a few days ago. I've been here a few times previously (prior to me being a Yelp member). I hadn't been to this place in about a year and that day, I felt like eating a burger but wasn't in the mood for a Whopper or a Big Mac.

On the day that I went, it wasn't too crowded. The burger prices here are more expensive than at the bigger fast food restaurants. I opted to get a small bacon burger, regular drink, and large fries and it cost a whopping $15.90. I had the option for spicy fries or regular fries and I opted for the regular fries. The only difference between the two is that after pulling the fries from the fryer, along with adding salt to the fries, they also add a Cajun-type salt.

After getting my bag with my burger and fries and the cup for my drink, I went to the self-serve soft drink fountain and filled up my cup. There was a sign in front of the soft drink dispenser that free refills were allowed. I also grabbed some peanuts from one of the boxes that they had near the self-service soft drink dispenser and went upstairs to eat.

The burger was very good. It was one of the better burgers that I've had but I still feel that the burger that I had at Shack Stack in Las Vegas was just a bit better. The fries were standard cut fries with their potato skin intact. The size and shape were to my liking but I felt that they were way too salty. I don't understand why fast food restaurants dump the salt onto the fries after they place the fries under the sun lamps from the fryer. I could have probably asked him to forego putting more salt onto the fries but neglected to do so since I was filling my drink at the time. When I was halfway done eating the fries, I felt that I should have ordered the regular fries instead of the large fries.

After eating the fries, I tried some of the peanuts that I had taken from downstairs and they weren't the best peanuts but I guess I shouldn't expect much since they were free for customers. When I finished, I went to the washroom and washed my hands. The washroom is decent for a fast food restaurant. After washing up, I went downstairs and refilled my cup before leaving.

I would rank them 3.5 stars which I've rounded up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Where do I start... As I'm ordering the hostess was very rude. I told her it was my first time here and without looking up she rattled off the whole menu under her breath. As we are waiting for the good we see a lady EATING behind the counter ! The guy working the grill was doing all the work and kept asking the girl who was eating to help and she would roll her eyes. Once we get our food, I remind them that I ordered a milkshake.  While waiting, the other cook came from the back, and started flinching and cursing at the guy working the grill. At one point he said \"I'll sock you in the mouth\"....Almost 15 minutes later I get my completely melted milkshake. It was disgusting. I will never return!"}
{"text":"I am not a french fry guy but I love their fries! The burgers are really good as well."}
{"text":"All burgers are double patties and big. Big like the size they used to be 20'years ago. Very filling and quality ingredients. Burgers for 2 with chips and 1 drink cost $24. You get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Topical 5 guys menu, but what make this place different are the extra friendly staff members!"}
{"text":"This place was clean and everything was pretty standard. The customer service was good and the staff was friendly. The burger and fries were delicious as usual. My only complain was that the burgers were a little smushed and it was FREEZING in there!!!"}
{"text":"Soooo... I've been hearing SO much about 5Guys all over the country that I just couldn't take it anymore! Finally, had to see for myself! 

I can't say how I feel exactly about being yelled at when walking into a restaurant... On one hand, it's kinda cool...on the other it was awkward as all get out because I was rolling solo and it seemed like there were tons of groups having a good old feast in there. I don't have a prob at ALL about dining alone, but for some reason, this particular place just made me feel like I had a 2nd nose on my face or I was on a runway because it was THAT obvious I entered alone. lol

Ordered my food (to go) and then had to sit at a table and continue with the \"it's all about me\" session...and OF COURSE before leaving everyone knew my name because it got yelled out for my pickup...Now, I know this is standard in a lot of places...but I'm telling you, the restaurant layout or something just made this visit different from any other I've ever experienced. lol

The food...well, it was \"good\" I suppose, but I think I was expecting to have tremors, palpatations and orgasmic-drooling going on from what I've ever heard about 5 guys... I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon (and a bunch of other random toppings) and I think I probably could've made one more exciting at home.  I will say the fries were really good (cooked in peanut oil - thank goodness...though that doesn't discount any calories. lol) and the portion size was HUGE! I probably ate about 25% of them, but still....My paper bag was soaked through before I got home, just an fyi. :D

All in all, a decent enough place with decent enough food. The staff appears friendly and like they enjoy their jobs (many were teenagers) so that's definitely a plus at any restaurant. 
I can't say I'd be a \"frequent flyer\" but I wouldn't mind going again...maybe at a less busy time though...unless I'm having a spot-on day. lol"}
{"text":"I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the price! But the burgers and fries are delicious. The burgers are made to order just for you! Has a good amount of toppings for your burger. The fries are amazing! They have spicy fries as well! But for the price, enjoy every bite! If anyone has an recommendations for a good burger in the valley...please let me know!!"}
{"text":"I would say that normally, writing a positive review for a chain restaurant like this isn't necessary but after seeing the relatively low rating for this particular location of Five Guys proved to be disheartening for me. Why? Because my boyfriend and I eat here on a regular basis and we love this place to death. 

My boyfriend and I love cheeseburgers and that is no lie. This might be one of our most favorite quickie places to get a good cheeseburger. The place is almost always busy whenever we go there and the food never disappoints. The employees are always friendly and the restaurant itself is usually clean. We don't ask for much and we never leave disappointed. 

I always order the Little Bacon Cheeseburger with grilled onions, grilled jalape√±os, grilled mushrooms, pickles, and BBQ sauce. I also always order the cajun fries (get the cajun fries! you won't be disappointed! so yummy!), too. The two are a perfect combo together. My boyfriend gets the Bacon Cheeseburger with grilled jalape√±os and BBQ sauce. The difference between the regular Bacon Cheeseburger and the Little Bacon Cheeseburger is the LBC is one burger patty, the BC is two burger patties. So much food, so freaking delicious! As far as the Cajun Fries, usually a regular order is enough for both my boyfriend and myself. 

I am going to say that this is the best fast food burger you can get. I also sometimes prefer getting a burger here at Five Guys than at Red Robin. Do yourself a favor, stop at Five Guys and indulge! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, hearty burger with natural cut fries but, overall, nothing really special about this place. The inside looks just like In-N-Out with signs covering the walls proclaiming all the positive reviews around the states it's received - almost like they're trying to pressure you into liking it. Well, it's great that the Washington Post really liked your burger, but this is Arizona and it's nothing new. 
The lady got my dad's burger wrong. She and the rest of the staff seemed a bit rushed - it was busy but I'd rather wait for a burger done right than have it rushed through. Dad changed his mind on cheese and never asked for bacon but got both. At least we didn't get charged for them? Burgers came wrapped in tin-foil (mine was also double-wrapped... ok?) and the fries were in a cup, all came in a bag like carry-out whether or not we ate inside.
If you think In-N-Out is completely over rated (and it really is) and don't mind not having a drive-thru, this might be an alternative for you. Instead of In-N-Out's super thin burgers and fries, you get two hand-formed patties with free toppings (I got grilled onions and bar-b-que sauce, though both bacon and cheese will cost you) on a normal sesame seed bun. Their fries are also thicker and naturally cut with a nice seasoning. 
I spent $20 on two burgers, a reg. size fry, and two sodas. Pricey for fast food style lunch. 
I know I've gone a bit back and forth in this review but bottom line: I won't be back."}
{"text":"Expensive for a burger place.
So many fries though!  Regular fries are enough for a least 2 people.
Burgers were good and well prepared, staff friendly and service was excellent.. I'd rate it higher if not for the price."}
{"text":"Typical 5 guys.
Was in the mood for fries and on those they do not disappoint, lot of fries.  Burger was aiight as well, but still price is steep."}
{"text":"I love the business model for this place, all your toppings are included with the price of the burger and you get to choose your toppings. The fry size generous. I love the Cajun fries dipped in barbecue sauce. The location is clean, very clean. I deducted one star for the price. I think it is a little steep."}
{"text":"I'm a tough critic when it comes to burgers.  I prefer burgers rare to medium-rare, nicely seasoned, dripping juices, and hugged by a bun that's not too bread-y.  The focus should be on the meat, though toppings are an important part of my overall burger experience as well.

I eat fast food very, very rarely.  Though, as mentioned above, I don't prefer beef cooked a whole lot, I can dig a tasty well-done patty.  For me, Five Guys falls into this category.  This Five Guys location in Robinson is the only one I've ever visited anywhere, and it made me and my mom happy after a long day at the hair salon, shopping, and driving.

A summary of my experience:
* The staff was delightful.
* The music playing--mostly '80s stuff--was fun.
* The dining area and restrooms were clean.
* The complimentary toppings I chose for my burger--grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, tomato, and mayo--were executed nicely and present in good quantity.
* The generic bun, which I don't usually like, worked fine here.
* The skin-on fries are greasy, and the way they're thrown into a brown paper bag with a cup isn't cute to me.  I can resist these fries.

I'd stop here for a burger while shopping in Robinson, for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! For $8 more than what the three of us usually spend at In-n-Out, we got burgers that were tastier, a serious mound of fries and a smorgasbord of drink varieties to choose from. We'll still hit up INO, but 5 Guys just rose to the top of our burger bomb hit list."}
{"text":"I've been an In-N-Out guy for many years, but i've gotta say that I absolutely love these burgers. You have the option to add A1 steak sauce, BBQ, and grilled Mushrooms to any of the burger options; That right there is reason enough to love this place. The drinking fountain is also top tier, offering over 100 different drinking options. The fries are ok, but not bad enough for me to drop it to a 4 star. Overall Five guys is a fantastic place to get your burger fix."}
{"text":"I feel violated. I had a cheeseburger and SMALL drink for $9.60.   The burger is large but they put on not even close to being ripe tomatoes on it.  After yanking the tomatoes off, I did enjoy the burger. My friend had Cajun fries and they were a oiley, soggy mess.  I don't understand the fuss or any type of value here"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I like more the burgers and fries or the soda machines. All are a hit with my family!"}
{"text":"These are excellent burgers no doubt , just ask to go light on the salt on the fries and they will , yes priced a little high but again an excellent burger and the staff are very friendly and the place is always clean. Remember go with the small fry cause there plenty of them"}
{"text":"Gave this place a first try today and I was overall impressed.   It had the decor of a deli kitchen with the red and white tiles all around.  Meanwhile you can see the cooks at work on your burger order.  The place was clean and peaceful.  The dining area entailed the presence of wooden tables and chairs that looked like it belonged to a kindergarten classroom from the 1980s.
 
With respect to the food, It was a fairly sized burger (regular size) that was tasty.  A regular size fries was quite a large portion as well as the regular size drink which cost a bit over $15 altogether after taxes which is only a few bucks more than most McDonald's combos. but at this place (Five Guys) you get a quality made burger and fries along with friendly service."}
{"text":"Can't believe it, but I'm now a total convert after only one burger.  During our staycation last week, we swung by to see if this could dethrone In-n-Out...and it did, at least for us.

Cheeseburgers:  mine with mustard, ketchup, pickles, raw onions and fresh jalapenos... his with the kitchen sink... and basic fries.  Lordy, that's a lot of fries.  Wish they'd soaked them though so they'd be a little crispier.

Loved that they have fresh brewed iced tea.  

Service at the counter was friendly, pleasant, helpful, smiling.  Price was fine.  No line when we got there, but it appears they've worked out the kinks, because guests were humming through it, and we got our burgers pretty soon after we ordered...

The peanuts were delicious."}
{"text":"Five Guys makes an excellent burger just the way you want it.  This is no frills food but it works and every location seems to be well trained."}
{"text":"1st time I have ever been to any 5 guys, it was a weekend during the day and we were able to walk right up and order.  Ordering was straight forward and simple and the food was up in a few minutes tops, it was hot and fresh.  The burgers were juicy ....like dripping all over the place juicy !!  The burgers aren't bad but don't know what all the hoopla is about, they remind me a thick Steak and Shake burger only 3x's as much!!  The fries were hot and plenty of them, and getting fires without salt was no problem. While eating the place starting filling up and the line moved SLOW . and then the place got loud .....for some reason they feel the need to YELL out food orders like some New York deli or something, I found this distracting annoying after a few minutes of the order taker barking out order #'s and what burger to make.  (OK  I know the reason, they don't have a mic or pa system)"}
{"text":"Damn! Another cool little burger joint has been found.  As I've said before, I love a good burger. And Five Guys make a good little burger.

The place is very clean and simple.  I like that! The menu is about as simple as it gets. Damn near looks like a menu from the 50s; Hamburger, Cheeseburger, Bacon Hamburger, Bacon Cheeseburger, Hot Dog, that's about it, really!

You get an exceptional selection of toppings, but nothing over the top. Alongside the norm, you can get grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, green peppers, and a kick as hot sauce. Not too hot, but has some flavor to it!

The burgers actually look like a burger, which means they are using fresh goundbeef (YES!), the patties don't look like they have been under an 5 ton press. It's big juicy burger patties. And if you order fries, you get a basket of fresh cut fries, check you bag, because over half your fries didn't fit in the cup they give you.  They're in the bag.

Another novelty in the restaurant is the Coke machine, it has screen with what appears to be every Coke product made and you can mix n' match to make your very our drink flavor combo.

Overall, the burgers are exactly good, the service is fast and friendly, and the prices are inexpensive.

I'll be looking for a Five Guys near me in DFW."}
{"text":"Very disappoint in the burger!! Very sloppy presentation. Quality control isn't there. I got 3/4 of a patty and very little grilled onions and mushrooms were from a can!!! I ordered lettuce but it was sparse, too. The Burger had no flavor. However, loved the french fries and the cool soft drink machine was fun to operate. Didn't like all the yelling from the cooks. Would rather have had an IN and Out burger any day! This is certainly NOT the best burger in the Phoenix Metro area when we have Joe's Farm Grill, Delux, Zinburger and Bluburger. I don't desire to ever return and will head to IN and Out the next time for a quick burger meal that has these Five Guys beat in quality and value.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good burgers for a large franchise ,we've enjoyed them on several occasions . Fresh cut fries are good too. Limited to burger selections , which is not necessarily a bad thing, but perhaps they could offer a monthly feature burger to jazz things up abit."}
{"text":"Well, I haven't had anything to eat all day and I thought I would stop in for a burger. My sister in law loves this place but I'm not sure what all of the hype is about!  The fries arent bad but I think I like Red Robin better. Plus, there's no alcohol here! What does a girl have to do to enjoy a beer and a burger?"}
{"text":"Overcooked burgers are apparently popular with a lot of people.

This location has seemed to give up on even a glimmer of hope for their quest to become the best burger.

I can see why the place is never packed like some of it's nearby competitors. It starts with the careless employees and ends with a burger fit for someone who just needs to consume.

And at roughly $8 dollars minimum per person, you might as well go to a decent restaurant if they are going to make you wait for the food served at this location. 

This last experience was the last straw. Cashier/order taker seemed to comprehend English but it was not the case as somehow our regular cheeseburger and bacon cheeseburger turned into their Little Cheese Burger, which is the kids sized overcooked and overseasoned hockey puck that they feature. The bacon on the cheeseburger was overcooked to the point where it all fell out of the burger onto the table when the burger was picked up.

It took 10 minutes to overcook our order incorrectly so we just left not wanting to be late for work.

Is it common for a dining in order to be bagged up to go at this place?"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon these guys by accident walking down Yonge street. 

Went in and was pleasantly surprised. 

Pretty good service, and okay price. 

Ordered 2 double bacon cheese burgers and large Cajun fry and medium drink for $32 and change. 

Fries would have been ordinary with out the seasoning but were decent. 

Both burgers were good and flavourful. Nothing over the top, but good."}
{"text":"Great burgers great fries! Went in to get a quick lunch and it was great!! but the service isn't that good, staffs were inattentive and very slow. I was being ignored for almost 10 minutes before they noticed that I was there at the counter ready to order."}
{"text":"I wish I would have tried five guys sooner! This is my new favorite burger place! I had to minus one star for no drive through but AMAZING"}
{"text":"Delicious dive food but simply overpriced in my opinion. A trio shouldn't cost me $20 and that much attitude.

Food:  7/10
Service:  4/10
Price:  3/10
Atmosphere:  n/a"}
{"text":"BEWARE IF YOU HAVE NUT ALLERGIES. Peanuts are available for self serve immediately next to the cash and consequently there are broken nuts and shells on the floor, counters and tables.  Also, they use 100% peanut oil for cooking purposes. 

The fries were absolutely terrible. Some with a burnt flavor and pockets of oil that absorbed into air pockets, others undercooked. We drowned them in ketchup to eat them. The fries are supposedly cut fresh on site which added to the frustration that they were so unappetizing. 

The cheeseburger got the highest score, 2/5. They missed toppings and the bun was just sooo greasy. It wasn't the flavorful meat-fat-cheese kind of grease either. 

They don't do combos either, all items are full price regardless of if they are ordered together. It was $15 for a basic cheeseburger and a regular fry. Neither of which were worth it. 

Overall, skip it. They only got the second star for free refills and the fact that the food here can potentially be good if you get some staff who know what they're doing."}
{"text":"I tend to eat vegetarian, but Five Guys burgers are the best of the burger chains, even compared to In N' Out Burger...

The large fries are huge and the toppings are fresh and tasty.  The problem is that I always eat a few peanuts before the burger and walk out stuffed...just goes to show you that a short menu does not mean that the experience will be somehow reduced.

Anyone who hasn't tried the franchise should do so right now!  You won't be disappointed.  If you are lucky enough to be in D.C., however, I envy you.  If you're in Ohio, then this will be the closest you'll get to burger heaven."}
{"text":"Love the menu, it's simple yet they offer a ton of toppings. Nowhere else in town can I get a to-go grilled cheese with whole grilled onion, grilled mushrooms, and a cool crisp tomato. The fries were delectable as well. 5 Guys staff was friendly and professional. The store was clean and neat.

Note, the coke machine at this location offers hundreds of coke-syrup combinations in the dispenser, futuristic and so dang neat!!"}
{"text":"I could probably carbon copy my last review of a Five Guys, but I figured I'd try to provide a different perspective. Also, it wasn't quite as wonderful this time around..

Five Guys Burgers and Fries is a sprawling, nationwide chain that serves a more premium burger than most fast food joints. Surprisingly, this particular location seems to be a little overlooked with its proximity to the more popular (and, in my opinion, superior) In-N-Out Burger. It's actually in the same plaza as a Chipotle, a Pei Wei, and a Jimmy John's. Heck, I've lived here for the year or so that this restaurant has been open and I've avoided trying it until now.

I had a very positive experience in my last visit to a Five Guys. I decided to duplicate my exact order. My entree was the cheeseburger ($6.79), which is a double patty monster (as opposed to the \"little\" burgers). I had it topped \"all the way\" (a standard order of several toppings) plus relish. My side was a large order of cajun fries ($4.99).

The burger was great. The patty was a little dry, but the cheese and all the toppings cover this up for the most part. The bun held the contents just fine. I thought it could have used a little more salt, but savory and sweet flavors (and a little sourness from the pickles) provide plenty of stimuli for the taste buds.

As for the fries, I expected a tremendous portion since I intentionally tried to give myself leftovers. Well, it looks like more fries were in the rest of the bag than in the actual fry-holding cup. Not sure how you'd handle this otherwise, but I gave up and took my order home and emptied the bag into a plate. The cajun seasoning was delicious, but I recall the fries themselves being more crunchy before. They were mostly soft tonight when I ate a handful at the restaurant. Texture is everything with fries, and on top of that, the seasoning/salt was uneven at best.

The complimentary snacking peanuts are as tasty as anywhere. The size of this store is actually just about the same as the last one that I visited. I have no idea how busy it gets during meal rushes, but I went around an hour before closing and saw no customers at all inside and placed/received my order quickly.

Overall, this visit was less than ideal. Compared to what I had here tonight, I would certainly prefer In-N-Out and I might even go for the drive all the way to the Strip for Shake Shack. But it's still better than most of the chains out there, so it's worth an occasional visit."}
{"text":"I can't believe how expensive the burgers were especially for fast food. I got 2 burgers, 2 fries, and two drinks and it was almost $30. Not to mention the costumer service was really weird. They kept shouting and joking to each other while taking our order and I found it to be really annoying."}
{"text":"I'm a Vegas native and 5 guys is good but not fantastic. It's a very good thing that you can add any toppings for no additional charge but I feel like they need to season the hamburger meat. So far every time I have been here the meat has been very bland and tasteless. I NEVER get onions on anything, but yet I was very turned off because everything on my burger tasted like a raw onion and come to find out there was one on there so I had to throw the rest away because I can't get past that taste.  The fries were very over done and burned on the ends but at least it was fresh oil unlike other food places I have been to. 
One concern I had is that while sitting and enjoying my time with my family there was an employee just wondering around all lost while customers were near the counter, but when they leave she is back up at the counter talking and normally I don't care but I could hear the whole conversation and some things should not have been said out loud. Basically airing her dirty laundry. 
My 2 last concerns is that when you are sitting there, you shouldn't hear the employees constantly yelling YEP YEP YEP. It gets annoying very fast. Especially when it gets louder and louder. In addition, you should really offer a military discount because I know that other locations do."}
{"text":"Just OK. Blah. Soggy fries. Boring bun -similar to a bun that you would buy at a large grocery chain that has a 4 week shelf life. Nice flavour to their beef. Bland fake cheese. Nice bright and very clean dining area. Been a few times but always forget it's a big bland whatever with a $15+ price tag. Burgers priest or many of the local independent places have better food for the same price."}
{"text":"In-n-out on steroids. The burgers and fries are made fresh and openly in front of you. A wide assortment of topping options. Don't forget the hot dogs too. The fries are thick and soft to my liking. The Cajun version is super tasty, but beware of the spice"}
{"text":"Love the service standards as well as the food.  This chain knows what they're doing when it comes to burgers.  As simple as it gets, choose your burger, choose your toppings, choose your size, regular/cajun fries, and choose your drink.  Sounds simple, but when you're indecisive like me and have all those options...it becomes a dilemma I love!  I love the topping choices, the regular/cajun fries choice and the best part...the soda choices.  I will go for five guys just for the drink choices alone. *When you order fries, there will be fries in your fry cup...and then some."}
{"text":"Never again. I got home to find that I'd spent $20 for 2 half cooked burgers. #WTF Yes I'm heated after not eating all day only to get home and still have to find something to eat."}
{"text":"So since everyone is comparing this place to In-N-Out I will base my review on a comparison of the two.

1. the atmosphere. Pretty similar to In-N-Out. It's got a classic burger joint kinda feel. Although it's very loud. Some coworkers and I went at lunch and we had a hard time hearing each other. It was very busy and the music was cranked. 

2. the burger. Okay, so it is more expensive than In-N-Out but it's much bigger. I got the small and it was still a pretty thick patty plus you get all the toppings you want. I like that there are so many options so you can customize your burger. I got mine with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo. I thought the meat was flavorful, the veggies were fresh and the bun was fresh too.

3. the fries. WAY better than In-N-Out. I've never really understood why people think the fries at In-N-Out are so great. Yeah, they're fresh but I think they are a little bland. Five Guys fries are also fresh but have a much better flavor. They are cut much bigger and the portion is huge! We each ordered our own fries (all of us were Five Guys virgins) and not one of us finished the order. One guy ordered a large and it was insane. The five of us probably could have shared a large. Or at least a large and a small. We threw away so many fries it was redonkulous. 

Overall, my group left Five Guys stuffed and satisfied. I think it's just as good as In-N-Out if not better because of their awesome fries."}
{"text":"Well, this is absolutely long overdue. I was visiting my girlfriend who goes to NAU for her birthday last November, and stayed at the Fairmont Princess. On our last day together, we decided to come to this specific Five Guys. As we walk into the restaurant  we're greeted by your typical fast food worker with a smile-- great, everything is going normally. After we placed our orders in I headed to the restroom. To my surprise, I caught a \"chef\" and some dish boy behind the counter gawking at my girlfriend with absolutely disgusting sexual intent. As soon as they noticed I came back, they went back to work and acted like nothing happened. I went over to my girlfriend and asked what was happening and she had told me that the chef went out of his way to stare her up and down, smile, and wink at her while I was gone for nearly two minutes straight. It took nearly everything in my power to keep from reacting poorly. Guys, if you don't want your girlfriend to get sexually harassed, avoid this location."}
{"text":"Five Guys you woo me with your delicious burgers and fries! The burgers are fat  juicy, flavorful and delicious! These burgers are old school Midwest diner type burgers.....Greasy the way a burger should be! I don't know what the problem is in AZ The burgers and Fries are excellent! The service at this location has always been fast and friendly. 

These are awesome big ole greasy burgers! GO EAT ONE!

Side bar (Debbie S) Post your review once not on every location that you have never been too that is just plain RUDE!"}
{"text":"I love their burgers!   Anytime we are in a hurry, this is my go to place.    The little cheeseburger is big enough for most people and a little fry is more than enough for one person.  

You must try this place"}
{"text":"Good place for a greasy burger.  It's loud, loud music and loud kitchen but it works.  Good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"So many places try to make a better burger. Different meat, weird fats, or even extra seasoning on the patty. Whatever Five Guys is doing, they've got it right. 

I ordered a \"Little\" Bacon Cheeseburger, with the staples, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, BBQ sauce and mustard. It was just right in size. The burger was perfectly cooked, and all the toppings were good, except the lettuce. It was like it got too hot, but it was all wilted and weird. Not a reason to get grossed out, it was still awesome.  I was with Franny and Juilian, my love-bird friends, and fortunately, got a hold of some of the fries they were sharing.  They were amazing. Maybe just a touch too much salt, but good nonetheless.  

Any place wins my heart if you have those futuristic coke machines that plop out any weird concoction of soda with random flavors like grape, peach and vanilla. Grape sprite for the win.  Try it. Trust me. 


Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"What is not to love? Friendly staff, flavorful burgers, and deliciously seasoned Cajun fries."}
{"text":"Burgers were still good but fry portion was pretty chintzy. Previously we have ordered a large and had plenty to feed the 3 of us with some leftover but not tonight. We ordered for pick up and I'm questioning whether they gave us the right size even. Too many places around to get burgers and fries and consistency is the name of the game."}
{"text":"I drove past In-N-Out and Smashburger to get here, and I'm not unhappy with my choice. Good, solid burger, made the way I wanted it, no crud I didn't want.  I might pass on the fries next time.  The price is a bit high, *and* they give you your money's worth--I ordered a small cajun fries, and the paper bag I received was half filled with fries--the burger at the bottom was completely buried. I don't know if that's normal, but it was like two potatoes' worth, and I ended up tossing most of them because I just didn't want that much fries (which is why I ordered a small to begin with). The cajun seasoning had a nice level of heat."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Over-filling the yummy fries  is awesome! Impossible to leave here hungry."}
{"text":"The title and menu are one in the same. Five Guys Burgers and Fries offer that (plus dogs) and nothing more. But I guess why fault a place for their limited menu as they are staying true to their theme, right?

Both times I've been to Five Guys, there has been a line. The lines move fast though as they seem to employee a TON of people. I counted 16 the last time I was there! 3 items on the menu, no dishes to be cleaned, everything is served in disposable bags, no drive-thru, they don't even have to fill drinks as there is a self-serve fountain machine.... yet they have 16 people working! Wow. Good for them.

Big sacks of potatoes are stacked up to form a divider from the seating area and the wait line. The fries are fresh cut and fried in peanut oil. There's even a daily sign that informs the diner where the potatoes came from that day. (Somewhere in Idaho). 

There is a box of shelled peanuts to munch on if you simply can't control your hunger for a few minutes while your burgers are prepared. On the walls, there are so many quoted reviews and awards that it seems like they are trying to convince you that what you are about to eat is the \"best burger ever\". Expectations were through the roof before I even took one bite. 

While the burgers were probably better than most other fast food joints, I was disappointed in the lack of cheese choices. If you want cheese, it's \"American\" and that's it. I would've expected better from a dedicated burger joint.  I also would've liked to see milkshakes as an option. Instead, your beverages are limited to their fountain selections. I do appreciate all of the toppings being \"free\". And one order of fries is plenty for two people.

Overall, it was a decent burger, but like the title, nothing more. Decent ingredients cooked decently. That about sums it up. Nothing notable about the burger stood out to me. I imagine this burger will appeal to the masses and in a pinch I will go back, but personally, I felt just \"meh\" about it."}
{"text":"Where are the FDA when you need them!? People with nut allergies, this is a death trap. There are peanuts all over the floor when you walk in. First of all that's a hazard and a safety violation. Someone could end up tripping over a peanut and fall and break both their arms. Also where is sanitization and hygiene? Why would you not sweep food off the ground. And the big crates of peanuts as you walk up to the door are just a sad attempt at marketing. Most of their foods use peanut oil so if you are allergic and someone gets Five Guys stay away. Because they could actually end up killing you. Their burgers are greasy and end up wasting ingredients as they overestimate how much the burger can hold. I don't see how people have made this a business. As a resident in Henderson, I am afraid to see what will happen next at this house of horrors. Very disappointed, Five Guys."}
{"text":"A short review:

Want to know what their burgers taste like?  Go to Jack in the Box, and order an Ultimate Cheeseburger.  That's what it tastes like.  The fries are similar to those at Teddy's Bigger Burger.  

Disappointing.  In n Out is most certainly better."}
{"text":"These guys are the best! What great customer service! Thank you so much! 

Walked in and was greeted with a smile. Good start to a dinner! 

You get to see the food being prepared. 

The large fries could have fed a small village- yum!!!"}
{"text":"Solid burger joint. Solid fries.

I love that all the toppings are included in the price, so you can customize without feeling \"nickel and dimed.\"

There are other burger joints that really try to blow your mind with creativity, but Five Guys just want to stick with the tried and true.

You will leave happy and full, but you are unlikely to have a gastronomic adventure."}
{"text":"I'm giving this two stars because the people who work there are nice. But, also two because food is disgusting."}
{"text":"I arrived before noon, this location is near by the McCarran Car Rental Terminal which was convenient before catching a flight home. 

I went with a regular hamburger which has two patties and loaded it up with just about everything. I added an order of regular fries and a beverage and the tab came out to over $12.00 which I thought was pricey.  The meal was just okay and to be quite honest the meat was flat tasting and messy to eat. The fries were just average - i should have went with the Cajun fries. I've dined at other Five Guys locations but the food here was nothing special was quite boring.

Would I return - probably not to this location."}
{"text":"Although the place was very busy on NYE, the service was good and the staff were efficient.  My bf thoroughly enjoyed eating here, and said that he hadn't had a \"real burger\" in awhile.  I had the cheeseburger (except I didn't really taste the ketchup so I added in extra) with tomatoes, mayo, and lettuce, while he had the bacon cheeseburger with everything except for mustard.  The burgers here are HUGE, they have two beef patties on the burgers, and my boyfriend's burger was even larger with the extra bacon and toppings.  Drinks were refillable and we had a large fries with extra fries over spilling into the bag, which we didn't mind as he wanted to fill up his fries craving.  I just wish they had onion rings.  I think we spent $25~ for our meal.

TLDR; come here for good burgers and fries at a reasonable price.

I'll definitely be back, the first time I tried 5 Guys Burgers & Fries was at a different location and I was craving some ever since that experience"}
{"text":"Oh me, oh my, there is a Five Guys near me now!  Oh happy day!

We were heading over to a different place for lunch when we saw that a Five Guys had moved in next door.  Sorry other place, you just got bumped for Five Guys!

First let me tell you that I am a burger lover.  I am always trying to find a great burger wherever I  am.  When I was in Kenya a couple of years back, I almost died because there weren't burger places in the Safari-lands.  I went 3 weeks without a burger and almost died, I swear!  So whenever I find a great burger joint, it makes my day and I love to spread the word.

So we walked into the store and all you can smell is wonderful, meaty goodness.  I knew my mind was about to be blown and boy was it!  We walked up to order and that is when I saw the wall of options you can get on your burger for no extra charge.  You can go simple or crazy and everything is the same price.  I love condiments, so I was really happy with the extra options like A1, BBQ, and hot sauce.  Life needs spice, so might as well add it to the burger, right?

We waited a few minutes for our burgers and that is when I saw the Coca-Cola machine of my dreams.  So many options to customize your drink.  I love soda, almost as much as burgers, so I was in heaven.  It was almost overwhelming to have so many options.  I was just happy that I was able to try out several different soda combinations during our visit.  I think I drank my entire month's allotment of soda during this one visit, but it was worth it baby!

And then the fun began because our burgers were ready.  The first bite of my delicious burger made me see stars, in a good way.  I even chewed slowly to make the moment last longer.  I had juices and sauces all over my face and running down my hands, but I was in love.  Sorry hubby, the burger may have bumped ahead of you on my love meter!

Now every burger needs some fries and the fires here do the job well!  They do a cute thing here by posting where the potatoes that your fries are made out of were grown.  It is fun to know such a little detail.  My fries came from Boise, ID, in case you were wondering.  We each got an order of the Five Guys Style and the Cajun flavor and loved both of them, but we only needed one order between the 3 of us.  I think one order would feed a small family, so keep that in mind when you order your fries.  They were great fries though.  You can tell that they are fresh cut and fried right away.  They were yummy and delightful.

Another thing I really liked was that they label each burger.  It is nice just to look for your burger # on the top of the burger, than having to open each lovely present to check and see if it is yours or not.  Great idea Five Guys!

So yes, I have a new burger place for when I am on the go.  I am lucky that one isn't too too close, otherwise I might end up being 500lbs.  If you haven't tried Five Guys, go do it now!"}
{"text":"So I am new to the Five Guys phenomenon and I am so excited to have seen the light!  

My husband and I found this place when we were trying to decide what to have for lunch one day.  We had heard people talk about it, but hadn't been by one when we wanted to eat.  I'm so glad we finally found one at lunch time though!

{"text":"The service was good, the burgers were nothing extraordinary, not somewhere I'd recommend for an awesome burger but it does the job"}
{"text":"Love this place!

Went yesterday with a friend and had a great burger experience. I noticed a definite \"50's vibe\" going on when we were greeted by a friendly worker behind the cash register.

Unique burger options and love the fact that their \"toppings\" don't cost anything extra. Had the single cheeseburger sans onions and Cajun fries - very fresh and tasty!

Was surprised they didn't have ranch dressing or cook-to-order meat (they only grilled medium well).

Big fan of their soda machines! Literally had SO many options such as PowerAde (and Zero) with raspberry, grape, etc etc. You could even order Sprite with grape! Huge accolades there.

Food impressed me as well as the set-up and cheery service. Great job!"}
{"text":"I like the burgers here they are prepared fresh and to order , but they are messy as f@&$ !!! Don't go here if you are wearing your good clothes cuz chances are they we will be ruined !! ( or smell like peanut oil , when you leave ) seriously the amount of toppings you get ( or choose from ) is enormous !! The meat is cooked all the way thru and lightly seasoned , the bun is spongy and fresh , but by the time the burger is wrapped and toppings added it barely holds everything in , as for fries they are cooked to order as well and freshly cut , you can get them Cajun style , but recommend the seasoning on the side , because they can get a bit over zealous in it's application , so much so that they become too spicy to eat . As fries go , some are soft and flimsy others are crisp little potato nuggets , but they are fresh cut and that's to be expected ! They do have a wonderful soda machine that let's you create your own soda creation , mine is diet cherry peach fanta !! Lol , I would give a five star , but the smell after you leave there lingers , ( and stays in your car , if you get order to go ) it's definitely not an every day meal , but maybe about every 6 weeks or so the craving for a messy - have to wash your hands twice type of burger hits !!"}
{"text":"Great burger!! It was my first time here and was Impressed, just a couple things I didn't like though, the mushrooms for my burger could have been cooked more, and the grilled onions were AWOL even though I ordered them for my burger, as a first timer , I wish I would have known the burger was as big as it was, two patties!! ( it was great , but I don't like showing up to work bloated, lol) also even tho their open concept kitchen is great to show you their freshness, you leave smelling like burger and fry grease, really!!! I ate there due to a drs appt nearby, and the nurse , guessed where I ate before I mentioned anything, !! She said to avoid it she just gets it to go!! But all in all great burger and awesome fries( small order feeds 2 ) just don't wear nice clothes or anything u need to dry clean, cuz really the smell stays with you!! ( had to shower again , before I went to work!!)"}
{"text":"After my dinner at Five Guys tonight it has become obvious that I don't give them enough love. The burgers are so remarkably fresh when compared to other fast food burger destinations. They make a good burger with a smile on every face behind the counter and that puts a smile on my face too.  Five Guys runs a good business and they do it without the help of sexy girls making a mess, clowns, large headed watchamacallits meant to jump out of boxes, creepy kings, obnoxious redheads and talking chihuahuas like some fast food places. They stand alone and offer up an amazing experience. I appreciate that a burger can be customized as I please and that it is not an inconvenience to them. Tonight I had a cheese burger (two patties) with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, grilled mushrooms, mayo and ketchup. It was messy and delicious as a good burger should be. I only wish the mushrooms were fresh instead if canned (I think they are canned). I also appreciate that there are two kinds of fries, regular and cajun, though I don't actually care for the fries. But if I did I would be thrilled with how many fries they give you. A bag with whatever size you ordered plus an additional scoop on top of that. Fantastic. I appreciate the free peanuts in the shell offered up to the patrons. Its a nice touch though I don't fully understand it. Finally, I appreciate the soda fountain where you can customize your drink in countless ways. Two tumbs up, Five Guys."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very excited to go here...However, we weren't very excited once we ate there.  My parents, some friends and a radio review all said this place was awesome.  We also thought the line out the door and around the corner meant it would be worthwhile too.  Not really the case.  

I ordered the small cheeseburger with bbq sauce, grilled onions and grilled mushrooms.  I ate about  of it and was going to scrap it.  I decided to take the toppings off and it actually got better.  The onions and mushrooms weren't grilled...more saut√©ed.  There was barely any bbq sauce.  Just not that good.  My husband got the small cheeseburger with A1 sauce, tomato and lettuce.  He said he's was just \"okay\".  The fries were okay.  If you like thick cut fries with the potato skin on...go for it.  They aren't very crisp...more soggy.  The portion of fries is semi ridiculous!  We ordered 1 order...2 people eating off of it...we still threw away over  1/2 of a bag.   

At the end of the day...will we go back???  Probably not.  The entire time we kept saying \"It's just not Smashburger!\"  And guess where we went a couple days later because we still wanted a good burger???  Smashburger!"}
{"text":"I have had Five Guys a few times now at various locations and I have only been moderately impressed. Stopped in here a couple of days ago and it was okay. If I had to choose between In N Out and Five Guys, it would be In N Out hands down. Service was good, cashier was polite and prompt. I ordered a cheeseburger with a little cajun fry. The cajun fry's are good and they do set Five Guys apart from other burger shops but I think if you are a burger shop, you must do both burgers and fry's equally as good.

My burger was okay. It was not bad by any means but it was not great. I ordered it with jalapenos and A1 which was different but a good flavor combo. Overall decent experience. I wouldn't count it out completely but I would't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"This is the best five guys I've been to.  When I came in Raul greeted me and took my order.  When I was waiting, to order [barely] took over eight minutes. Raul offered me a free shake for that, I was super impressed and taken aback because that was just so sweet.  I really appreciated this five guys experience I wish I lived closer because I would come here more often."}
{"text":"This is my first time trying five guys. 
I honestly thought they were a pizza place lol
But the food was good it tasted homemade 
I just hate the foil they put around the burgers. I don't it's to keep it warm, but I don't like it. 
The guy who took my order. Nice young guy, he was telling me he was short 2 cents and was that okay. And I said yes because I was just going to tell them to keep it anyways so he owed me 10.07 and he gave me back .5 so I walked away and I looked in my wallet like wait hold on... I thought I was trippin. I double checked before I jumped to conclusions 
I finally walked back to the counter and I asked him \" hey you gave me 10c right \" and he was like yeah. And I showed him the receipt and mentioned that I never got my $10 he apologized sincerely and gave it back with no problem so I do appreciate that and I do know mistakes happen. Hell i work in customer service at a call center. I forget too ! So that was fine. I just wanted to bring it up. Check your money before you walk away, because if you're like me you tell them you don't need a receipt or ball it up as soon as it touches your hand. 

I like the fact that you can choose all of your toppings and my burger was honestly good asf. Felt a little soggy and sloppy in a way but I'm not complaining I did a magic trick and made it disappear. 
Anyways, I specifically asked for no onions, TWICE
but best believe they were onions on there. Now luckily I didn't have a problem with onions. Sometimes I eat them other times I just ask them to hold them. So I think he should have made sure that was correct. 

Now the price is kind of expensive but I feel like it's worth it, if you have it to spend. 

The fries are a lot. I usually eat all my fries in one sitting. I had to take the rest back to work. 
The single patty is honestly enough if you get fries.
Now if you take a look at my Burger I don't see why I needed two tomatoes but I still ate it. It just didn't make sense to me lol. But i think it's worth 4 stars. Wanted to do 5 and also wanted to do 4 because I got onions, but whatever. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Normally, I don't comment on the food or menu for chain restaurants but as this one is still relatively sparse here I will do so:

This place beats the other premium burger chains hands down!  Burgers are juicy, large (1/2 pound is standard) and delicious.  Fries are wonderful and the cajun option is great.  Ambience is also nice (though much more specifically American than the generic ambience of a McDonald's; some Canadian customers might notice this).  Topping selection is not only extensive but they are quite generous with them.

This particular location should also be complimented for very nice, friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"For some reason I crave Five Guys every now and then. I don't know why. It's not particularly good and it's quite expensive. 

Decent burger, decent fries. Horribly priced unless you can make up for it in free peanuts.

It gets an extra star for the music selection, it's always rocking."}
{"text":"Yum! I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries. Big portions. Good food. I will be returning. Also, free peanuts are available to snack on while you wait! There was friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"They vegan option so much better then IN-N-OUTs so much more stuff to pile up on a meatless burger. Also the fact that they give the free peanuts i think i filled up on those before my food was even ready. The first time i went it was perfect, second time asked for no cheese and got home melted cheese everywhere :( so I will try again but hopefully it doesn't happen again."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to get a burger.  I live the little bacon burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, BBQ sauce. This testament to the power of the burger gods is only $6! Love this place.  Daym Daym DAYM"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with some coworkers and we all enjoyed our meals. We all had burgers and fries which were very tasty. I had a chocolate shake that I loved! The Cajun fries were excellent and they sure fill the bag full of them. The location is nice, the seating plentiful and the employees were friendly and well informed. My only complaint is the cost. $14 for one person is a lot!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch at this Five Guys today. It was fine -- what I would expect from a Five Guys. This location was a little dirtier than other locations that I've been to, but the staff was friendlier and checked by our table a couple of times (which I had not experienced before). I wouldn't mind going back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I love dining here after a long afternoon shopping at IKEA and The Mall at Robinson. He loves their burgers with a mixture of assorted toppings, and I love the grilled cheese dipped in a little malted vinegar. Fries, even just the regular size, are a must-share size. However, make sure to get your own soda. I cannot resist the amazing new Coca Cola soda machines! Diet Coke with Cherry and Vanilla?! It's a dream come true!

If you frequent the Five Guys chain, this location is the same no-frills concept and will not surprise. However, if you're new, don't be surprised by the divey chain atmosphere... and don't forget to grab free peanuts near the entrance!"}
{"text":"good burger. friendly staff. 

prices are about 3 times that of in n' out.

glad i tried it. will never go back. sisimply way overpriced."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food burger in the valley.  Yes, InNOut is also good, but the amount of toppings you can get here is what I'm really after.  Plus, the meat is just more flavorful.  They are open late and always greet you with a smile...even if you waltz in 10 minutes before they close.
Cheeseburger, all the way, minus mayo, plus jalapenos."}
{"text":"Solid burgers and fries, and holy crap do they give you a lot. The cup they serve fries in is more like a suggestion, as they fill the bottom half of the bag with fries anyway. Why waste money on cups? Cajun fries are the bomb, especially if you like a little spice. The jalapenos here are pretty kickin' too.

Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the price. I'd be here more often if it wasn't $10-$15 for one person. IMO a bit too high for what I'd consider a lunch spot, but you do get what you pay for, especially in this case."}
{"text":"Good burgers but we feel we were shorted on the fries.  For years... it was known that ordering fries would always yield a generous bounty of fries.  Not here, not today.  Three of us, large bag of fries, and.... disappointment.  My wife commented about the fries... I was humorously shocked... took the bag to the counter to be sure we received the large order.  Was politely explained that yes... sure enough... that was the large.  Wow.  $5.99 for fries and we leave not happy.  We spend $38, enjoy the burgers yet... the lack of fries leave all three of us laughing.  Humorous fail.  They need to work on their customer skills..."}
{"text":"So first off this is my first review ever on yelp and unfortunately it's not a good one. Last evening at 9:50 PM I called in an order to be picked up and I was told that it was too late to place the order even though they close at 10 o'clock. The guy on the phone asked if I would be there by 10 o'clock and I said yes that I was coming from Stapley and US 60 and I would be there within 10 minutes and he proceeded to tell me that there was too much traffic and that I would not make it at the 10 o'clock deadline so therefore he could not take my order. So I decided to drive over there and got there at 9:55 and walked in and started to place my order and I had requested that I wanted my fries well-done. He then stated to me that it's against company policy he to cook their fries well-done, so I then canceled my order and walked out. He was very rude and arrogant and he lost a sale because he couldn't drop my fries for an extra minute or two because it's company policy. I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"When this place opened up I had never head of five guys. The price is a little much for a burger but they are really good and you get what you pay for. Seems like and endless amount of fries they give you as well"}
{"text":"Just updating my review based on their new prices. Four junior cheeseburgers and two large fries are now costing a whopping $46. 

My previous review shows what two drinks 3 burgers and two fries were at. I don't know who this Five guys franchise thinks they are but in no way is their ambience, free peanuts or extra scoop of fries making up for these new prices.

It's no wonder now why the place is always empty.."}
{"text":"Over priced. The burger was dry and over cooked. The fires were to salty and soggy won't be back."}
{"text":"I eat at this Five Guys every now and then.  More like a lot now that I am 7 months pregnant.  Anyways I always get good service here and they are always nice and Five Guys are pretty much the same all-around (except in Summerlin where they have milkshakes!)  Today I wanted to just note that Luis was my cashier and he was SO nice that I had to write a yelp review just to say that he was friendly, polite, accurate and professional.  He got my pregnant butt extra pickles during my visit, made sure I had enough napkins, and also made sure to call across the restaurant a \"thank you\" and \"goodbye\" as I left.  He is probably the best person this Five Guys has ever hired."}
{"text":"Great burgers 
Good price now that I know better from eating elsewhere at so called gourmet places....
Great fries
Fresh burgers made to order"}
{"text":"I really think that you should avoid this place. Very expensive, tables are not cleaned quickly enough, I also found the staff to be in a grouchy mood. You can get great burgers elsewhere. I don't recommend this place at all!"}
{"text":"The meet was very thin was felling eating at MD don't recommend? fries was cold and saggy.
I always go to Five Guys and always happy with the quality and goodness , but this time I was so bad, I not recommend, don't came in here for lunch"}
{"text":"When you are tired of the Vegas grind and just want a classic American burger, head to 5 Guys. The burgers a bursting with flavor, and the fries are seasoned well. Whatever size fry you think you want, order the next one down as this 5 Guys always loads on the extras. 

The hot dogs are all beef, so if your kids want something different, they can still get the good stuff. Load up on the free roasted peanuts while you wait for your order to be cooked. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Always a great experience no matter what Five Guys I visit. The Coke freestyle machine is a bit overpriced but great fun!"}
{"text":"We finally tried out Five Guys! 

I liked how simple the menu was, though I was pretty sad to see that there weren't any milk shakes on the menu. 

The amount of fries they give you is obscene! We got one regular and one Cajun style, and between 3 fry loving people still had a PILE left over. 

The burgers are made to order with tons of great toppings to choose from. I do wish they would use a bit of a better quality bun, but that is my only real complaint."}
{"text":"Okay, it has been quite a while since I have returned to Five Guys. I don't really like the atmosphere here. It is way too bright, and not very inviting.

This time I was in the mood to try a BLT. Sounded really good. It wasn't. It was served on a hamburger bun. The lettuce was ice cold as was a small piece of tomato. There was mayo on it, and then on the bottom bun was what looked like about a 1/4 cup of crumbled bacon. It was just heaped on the bun. The flavor was nothing but grease. It was not appetizing at all. 

My husband got a double cheeseburger with everything. He liked his burger, but it was much bigger than he remembered it being. That is a good thing. We shared some fries. Their fries are greasy and limp. He really liked them, whereas I did not. Probably because there was so much grease in my BLT, I could not handle the overload of grease with these fries. 

For me, there was not much flavor in the food. We even tried some of the peanuts they have for you that are in the shell. Even these were not very good, and sort of rancid. I must have been here on an off day."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Five Guys for dinner on early Sunday afternoon. The first Five Guys location has been opened in Arlington, VA., which has became a favorite fast food restaurant since then. From 2003 until now, Five Guys has expanded to almost 1,500 locations spanning the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe and the Middle East. All the locations sell burgers, which use fresh ground beef. We went to Five Guys on 130 Ave SE, Calgary. It was our first time having food at this location. We always had Five Guys in downtown Vancouver before.

Environment

Five Guys on 130 Ave SE is a medium size of the restaurant. This location has the same styles as other locations -  many chairs and tables inside the restaurant. They were all clean and organize. Since we arrived restaurant in the late afternoon, the restaurant was not busy at all. We can sit wherever we want to sit.

Service

The same as other locations, customers ordered all the food in the front and then found the table. The cashier was nice and friendly.

Food

We have ordered regular fries, cheeseburger, cheese hotdog, and a milkshake. All the food were well cooked. They all came out the kitchen early. The burger was very juicy. There were lots of topping on hotdog. Both burger and hotdog were tasty, but the meat was a little bit salty. The fries were seasoned with a large portion. Fries were my favorite.

Prices

We spent around $30 for the meal. It was a little bit expensive."}
{"text":"Apparently this is the East Coast version of the famous California In-N-Out Burger. Let me tell you... doesn't even come close to In-N-Out!!! I had such high expectations for this place....

First of all, a Little Bacon Cheeseburger & Cajun Style Fries came out to over $9. Deal breaker #1.

Yes, it did have bacon on it, grilled onions, mushrooms, cheese, and the whole shebang... but obviously the SPECIAL SAUCE was missing. Deal breaker #2.

Deal breaker #3, it just did not match the freshness and wholesome goodness of In-N-Out. Maybe I'm a west coast hater, but still... def was not a miracle burger or anything."}
{"text":"This place is great! Always delicious. But today we got amazing service. Food came out fast but my burger was wrong. They missed half the toppings. When I mentioned this I excepted to just get some extra toppings handed to me. Nope. They remade my whole burger!!! Came out hot and perfect. 

To top it off the manager came out to talk to us to to ensure that everything was perfect. 

Stellar!!! Come here!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are juicy, hot, gooey and delicious! Fries are just ridiculous - hot, salty and messy. Staff is always friendly and food is prepared fresh and to order. I don't indulge often but when I do I go all the way in and just accept the guilt. They are expensive as well. Another reason i don't indulge often."}
{"text":"The burgers r pretty good I would compare this to in n out burger. The fries r much bigger and good. 
The staff is really nice they even gave us extra fries for what ever reason. She probably thought the girls that were w/me were hungry teenagers.... Lol
Pretty fast service and the good came up pretty fast.
I will be back and will tell others about this place."}
{"text":"Don't understand why this place is so busy. Food is very expensive and those were the saltiest french fries I've ever had. Great place to stop if you want to get 900% of your daily recommended sodium intake in one stop. Also, I saw articles stating they had gluten-free buns, but they do not unfortunately. 

Staff was friendly, though and the free peanuts were a bonus."}
{"text":"Burgers are ok mine was a little greesy. Better than most fast food places. There are other burger places that are better. I dont think I will be back since there are better choices close by."}
{"text":"Five Guys is doing everything right at its Scottsdale location. I've eaten here three times now, and each time gets better than the last. 

Whether busy or slow, the staff is friendly and helpful. On one visit, they forgot to put on the toppings on my burger, and when I returned to the front desk, they said right away that they'd make another one fresh with the toppings. And they said keep the un-topped burger. So it's was a pretty sweet 2-for-1 deal. 

The whole family loves the burgers and fries. Great eating!"}
{"text":"Great burgers ! Good service.
Very friendly staff, and the place was extremely clean.
Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a burger person but I LOVE 5 guys. Every time I've eaten at the one in Gastonia I've been greeted by super friendly staff and the burgers and fries are always delicious. Looking forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and in both cases, I had similar experiences.  The burgers are pretty good, though I would prefer one thick patty that can be cooked more rare.  The burgers are large and messy...both good things.  They seem to be especially proud of their fries, even posting where the potatoes come from.  I had cajun fries and they were tasty and plentiful, but in my opinion, kind of expensive.  

Two other things I liked were the free peanuts and the awesome soda machine."}
{"text":"WARNING:  PEANUT OIL used for fries!  My son has allergies to both egg and peanut so he was unable to eat here.  They use peanut oil for the fries and the buns may contain egg, yet the staff was uninformed and unable to find out!  Because they had a reputation for a good burger, my husband and I went back another day without our son to give it a try.  My husband's hamburger had NO MEAT! We are done....never again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Just tried it out for the first time and used their order online feature. Worked fabulously!  They wait until you are there before they package your fries to ensure that they are hot and perfect for you. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger bowl (no bun) and a regular fry. I would order the small fry next time as the regular size was a massive portion amount. The bacon was crisp and wonderful and the burger and fries were perfect. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sooo, I went to Five Guys tonight for dinner.  I think I found my new burger place!  I got the bacon cheeseburger with the two patties with all of the toppings that are not by request only i.e. mayo, mustard, ketchup, pickles, lettuce, tomato, and grilled onion.  That burger was so juicy and flavorful!  I loved it!  The fries were fresh and plentiful and the cajun seasoning hit the spot!  I found it funny that there were so many people working behind the counter and there was only one girl working.  Sure, the place is a bit more pricey than in-n-out, but you get a lot more food as well.  The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was because when I have a good burger, I need a strawberry shake to go with, and they do not sell shakes!!!  That sort of let me down a little bit, but other than that, I had absolutely no complaints.  I will definitely be returning to Five Guys!"}
{"text":"The problem with Five Guys is I want to eat their dirty, greasy fare all the bloody time. Thinking about it right now actually as I have a pint down the road."}
{"text":"The pros definitely outweigh the cons, but let's start with the cons just because it's more fun.

1. The scary tweakers RIGHT outside. Real entertaining to watch through the windows at first, but I noticed a lot of children in the restaurant staring out there, and heard one say she was scared; so that's no fun for anybody. But, because that has nothing to do with Five Guys as a company, only their scary surroundings, I didn't take away any stars for that. I just wanted to mention it because I'd want someone to mention it to me. :)

2. I took away the star because there is something fundamentally wrong with the french fries. I know there's lots of mixed reviews in the commentary, but I can only speak for myself when I say that I did not enjoy them at all. Neither did my friend who joined me.

But there's lots of pros!

1. Super fast service. I think our food was ready in less than a couple minutes. 

2. Lots of seating. Seating everywhere, I can't even imagine the place ever filling to capacity.

3. The burgers really are the shizzle. I had a bacon cheeseburger, and it was quite delicious. I think the buns are \"butter buns\" and the burgers are made right there when you order them so they're super fresh.

4. There's a pretty dope coke machine that distributes a plethora of teas, lemonades, sodas, you name it.

Not much else to say... it's a burger joint. :)"}
{"text":"Unimpressive if this is the east coast version of In-N-Out.

DEVASTATING:
- Forgot to put onions in my burger even though I specifically asked for them.
- Tasteless fries.
- Low quality beef with chunks of fat in it.
- Super greasy.
- No shakes to wash it down?
- Water costs money.
- Messy tables and chairs with the last guy's grease all over 'em.

GOOD:
- It really is five guys working there!  When one guy went off duty, another guy appeared instantly.
- Looks like an authentic burger.  And the fries look really unique.  Wish they tasted unique.
- Tastes ok until about halfway through... then it's painful.  Maybe the portions are just too big.
- Take credit cards.
- Free peanuts to chomp on while you wait."}
{"text":"Came here for their Cajun fries. I like that they have a small size, the regular size I got last time was huge! Yummy fries, and they make them fresh which is cool. Might try their veggie sandwich one day."}
{"text":"I had tried Five Guys on one of the very first days I got to Tempe because my boyfriend had heard people rave about it so much. I didn't write a review of it then because I honestly forgot how what I thought about it. But now that I've tried it again, I remember how not memorable it was. 

Admittedly, the burgers are really good. They come with a huuge variety of dressing, sauces, vegetables, and other granishes, so you can have your burger any way you like it. The normal size burgers have 2 burger patties, so if you're like me and are just used to the real normal one-patty burger, opt for the \"little\" hamburger, even though it's really not little at all. 

The hamburger did taste really good and there's malt vinegar that adds to the glorious messiness of eating a burger, but really, I don't think it's any better than any other burger place - including In-n-Out. They have unlimited peanuts, but I'm meh about peanuts. Um...their fries are good, but again, not too special. 

I would go back, but I don't think I'd ever crave going back."}
{"text":"Congratulations Five Guys! You are the single fast food burger I eat. It's just too delicious to ignore. Always fresh produce and thank you for offering jalape√±os so I can give my burger a little kick. Fries are great, too."}
{"text":"I don't get the Hype! It's good but not great. The soda machine was my first time with  one of those. I like it! The fries for me were the best part. The burgers are good just I cant tell you why they stand out to me."}
{"text":"I ordered Cajun fries. Got charged for Cajun fries. Didn't get Cajun fries. Not cool. Not cool at all. I usually come to this location just because it's closer to home, but after this, they lost my business. I'll go to another five guys from now on."}
{"text":"Five Guys Burgers and Fry's does a great job at welcoming new customers. Five Guys and Fry's does demonstrate excellent leadership and customer service. They have awesome food and it's delicious. The cashier offered good customer service. Thank you for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars
Better than your average fast food burger for sure. For $8.95 you can get 2 beef patties with cheese and bacon. The cheese was an actual slice of cheddar cheese. Not your typical Kraft sliced cheese you get at the supermarket. The bacon was very nice and crispy and did not have too much fat on it, just the way I like it. Also for $4.95 you can get Cajun style fries which gave the fries an extra kick of flavor. Overall a pretty good burger joint."}
{"text":"I love a good burger, and I just love Five Guys!

The staff here were very nice and friendly, and they answered any question that I had. I love how clean everything was and how fast I received my food.

I ordered a little bacon cheese burger with regular cajun fries, and I was stuffed after half of my burger and half of my fries. Next, time I return for a yummy burger I would get the same little burger but little fries not regular."}
{"text":"Great food and customer service. Jeramy showed lots of care for the customers and his position. He was super sweet and a model employee. He went out of his way to care for us and it was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"5 guys .... First tried in Florida, burgers are a great value and if you like fries they will give you a lot!  Wish we had one in Hawaii, but I guess I'll have to settle for visiting whenever I'm in Vegas.  This location is very clean and employs a friendly staff that definitely knows teamwork!  Great experience 5 guys!"}
{"text":"Simply the best, juiciest burgers made very well.  Their fries are excellent and I don't care what anyone else says but no other fries even come a close second in deliciousness.  We love this place.....the one in Fairlawn is good too, but this one is the Gold Standard."}
{"text":"Five guys is awesome, and this location is right up there. The burgers are juicy, fresh and of course, greasy! Seasoned fries are out of this world. 

My fav: Hamburger with lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms and A1 steak sauce. On the side, fresh jalape√±os! Try it, unreal good."}
{"text":"What can I say about Five Guys other than I'm so glad it finally made its way to Arizona. The burger is tasty, the fries are delicious, and it's super close to my house. My only beef with this place (haha get it..) is that it's pretty expensive for 2 people. For my boyfriend and I, it came out to almost $20 for 2 burgers, 2 fries, and 1 drink. That's pretty bad considering we can go to Chili's and spend the exact same amount. If I had to pick between here and In-N-Out, which I also love, I'd probably go to Five Guys even though I don't recommend it often because you'll probably have a heart attack :)"}
{"text":"A few things I want to outline about my experience here.  First of all I don't understand why it's $11 for a tiny burger fries and a drink.  Think about it for the same quality you could go to InnOut or even Chilis and be in a real restaurant.  I asked a question to the cashier who acted like she couldn't understand.  Or I should say I got a big huh.  More like stop bothering me.

Then I get rushed to place the order.  I'm watching her right now do it to the next guy to come in.  Then I said wait don't you have more than one size.  She says you ordered a double.  No I didn't I didn't say double.  I did not.  If I did I didn't want that so I made her start over.  I guess it was my fault that I wasn't clear on what I wanted to order.  It would be nice to have a little help and not be rushed.

The next thing to bother me is she goes from the register to the grill and starts cooking.  Okay so that might be why I was getting rushed to place my order because she might be the cook.  I watched her melt the cheese on a dirty grill and then put it on the burger.  I'm just glad she used gloves on her hands after she was handling the money.  But why is the grill so dirty.  Clean that thing between orders.

Also I note that on a friday before 1pm I was the only person in the place.  So I'm obviously not the only person with issues with this store.  

I'm not sure if it's the fancy coke machine they have in there.  But the diet coke was undrinkable.  I have noticed this issue a few other times on these new high tech machine.  Maybe they are too high tech for restaurants to run properly. It's really gross drinking soda that has no flavor.  Let me add for the $11 I spent for a fast food burger I expect the drink to taste perfect.  I remember back in the day when a burger was something you got at McDonalds for $299 the soda always wasted great.

Now lets talk about the fries.  does anyone actually think they taste good.  They are hot.  Obviously they are fresh.  But they have no flavor. I tasted a little salt but it's weird I never had a bland french fry.  

This is not my first time here.  IT's been a while I just forgot how much I didn't like it."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town but some of THE worst customer service.  After waiting in line I walked up to the cashier and he didn't even greet me! I said hello first and still didn't get a reply back! I'll wanted to say \"I'm sorry, am I inconveniencing you by ordering?\" So rude!! As good as the food is I will not return to this location!"}
{"text":"Rude. When ordering the cashier laughed and mocked at my pronunciation of words. Which is nothing wrong I just have a slight accent."}
{"text":"I want to like Five Guys Burgers, I really do.

My first experience with them wasn't really anything special. I do enjoy the fact that they make the burgers the way you want them too, but the ingredients going into the burger is nothing special.

Also, the way they stack the burger is what kills it for me. By putting the mushrooms and onions on the bottom of the double patties, it kind of melts the bottom bun, which was a big bummer for me. The meat wasn't spiced at all, but tasted fresh, which gives them some points. 

As for the potatoes, I don't really care where they come from, so having a sign to tell us where they come from seems kind of pointless. We got the Cajun spiced fries, which the wife didn't enjoy, but I liked. 

They tasted frozen though, which was kind of a let down.  EDIT: Just found out they always use fresh potatoes...didn't taste fresh.

Other than that, you do get plenty of food for the price, and the decor is nice. Staff was great. 

I might try again, but with Smashburger and Fatburger around, I might not."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it, but I like 5 guys better than In-n-Out.  I'm a Cali native and grew up on In-n-Out and I wanted nothing more than to say that 5 guys sucked and didn't compare.  Even though it is way over priced, the burgers are awesome and the fries are dope."}
{"text":"Depending what time you go this is a must. Burger foul: the late night shift forgot my cheese. Of course for a night cap you're not going to get the same quality of burger you get at 4pm; however for someone from a town with no Five Guys I always stop here, regardless of the time."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! And they helped my brother with a philanthropy project in high school. Just be careful if you have a peanut allergy"}
{"text":"Very average burger and the fries are just overpowering. 

Fun fact: A large order of fries from Five Guys has more calories than any other fast food chains large order of fries."}
{"text":"Total 5Guys fan, even before they made their debut here in Las Vegas.  There was nothing to it to hop on the 15 after work on a friday to head out to St. George for some 5guys. 

This location is really close to my house (flamingo/maryland pkwy), inside and outside of restaurant was CLEAN.  A dirty location will have me turn around and walk back to my car.  The staff was on point, and the manager made sure of it.  While I was there I witness the manager address his employee for not following proper dress code for work.  That is how you run a TIGHT operation.

Quality of food: AWESOME, hot, exactly what I ordered, no complaints

The 5 star rating is not based on food but more so on the appearance, cleanliness and operation of the restaurant.  Places near the university sometimes do not have the most clean locations, employees are not friendly and quality of food sub-par.  

That is not the case for 5guys on Flamingo/Maryland, but this is just my opinion, go check it out for yourself"}
{"text":"It saddens me to write such a bad review. My wife and I love Five Guys Burgers. This location at Sunset has gone down hill badly. This is the location closest to us and we went here often. The staff was friendly and quick, made you feel like you were in a small town diner. One night my wife and I go in and a couple things happened that kind of set me off.

First; The man taking our order was NOT friendly at all. His attitude was as if we were an inconvenience to him. He leaned on the counter with his elbows as he took our order. I have arthritis in my back, several herniated discs and sciatica and was able to stand long enough to order. I know this type of work is tough. I've been there, I've done it many times. But NEVER lean on my elbows while taking an order. 

Second; The gentleman calling out the order numbers that are ready, called them practically too himself nobody could hear him. He too acted as if all the customers there were an inconvenience. When I tried to verify that he called my number, he either didn't hear me or totally ignored me.

Not a single employee working that night was in the mood to be there. Or they wanted to be there doing their time and collecting a check, but help a customer? Pssh! I don't think so.

After that night my wife and I decided never again to go to THAT Five Guys again. Months go by, we're trying to find a place to eat and think about Five Guys. We decide to drive by and see if those employees are there. They were, we didn't eat there. This happened at least twice over the period of a year. 

A couple nights ago, we decide to give it a shot again. We were in the area. We drive by, don't recognize any of the employees and decide to give it a shot. Friendly staff this time, cool! But...the fries are probably their next most popular item to their burgers because they're good and they usually PILE on the fries! I ordered the medium order (Regular). The fries barely covered the bottom of the bag. I went up to the counter and told the guy I ordered a regular and showed him the bag and he immediately apologized and told me it would be 2 minutes for new fries. Great! I sit down to eat and my bun was stale! COME ON!!!! I just ate it and vowed never again to go to THIS Five Guys. I gave plenty of chances and would feel bad for the manager but now wonder if he/she cares. hmmm? Sorry! :-( Maybe the day crew is better?"}
{"text":"Had to try this place since everyone kept talking about it so here I go..

My boyfriend and I ordered online for our first visit. We loved that because it was very convenient to customize our own burgers. When I went in to pick up the food, it wasn't ready because they wait for you to get there to start cooking your fries. They want to be sure it's fresh!

Onto the food... I had the little cheeseburger (which was the perfect size for me) and he had the regular cheeseburger (two patties). The burgers were definitely a 5/5. They just melted in your mouth!! So good!!!! Now the fries are a different story.. We ordered a small of the regular fries and a small of the Cajun. We didn't enjoy the Cajun fries at all. Maybe it's just us but they were extremely spicy. It didn't taste Cajun.. It tasted spicy. No flavoring.

Overall, great burger place but I'll skip on the Cajun fries next time! Worth the price if you want a good burger. If you want something cheap, go to McD's to get a cardboard burger. Only quality burgers served here!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I love the food here, and I would normally give this place five stars, but the service tonight was not great! They completely left off my burger from the entire order, and when I went back to explain what happened, I had to completely re-purchase my burger. That should have been the end of it, but they forgot a few of my toppings. 
I'm not one to throw a fit, and I know that people have off nights, but I'm a little disappointed tonight. ?"}
{"text":"I had to down rate my review from a 5 to a 3 because the music was so loud we found it impossible to talk. My burgers was great! The fries were good and the peanuts were perfect. The melted cheese between two perfectly cooked patties was surrounded with crisp fresh lettuce, onion and tomato. The sauce and bun was perfect. Wish I had taken ear plugs or got my burger to go as I would love to give this burger place a 5 stars. Service was a tad slow and did I mention that the music was really really loud?"}
{"text":"Be sure to insert ear plugs before getting out of your car near this place! The manager must be deaf and all his help will be after working there for any length of time. You can hear the constant music and throbbing beat from the street. You might want to turn an assisted living accessories before entry just in case. My suggest: call in and have a brain dead overstrung ear budded young person go pick up your burgers. Yes the burgers are good. Bet the franchise would love to have the traffic In & Out has but they never will because the prices are to HIGH and the MUSIC is deafening."}
{"text":"The burgers are good the fries are good the prices are just too high PERIOD. Note: I am a professional who makes a great living and eat at expensive restaurants regularly where I drop $300-$500 for two so I'm not cheap I just feel FG is too expensive for what you get. Sticking with IN-N-OUT or Habit!"}
{"text":"These are my favorite burgers that remind me of a restaurant I used to go to growing up in Nebraska, so it is weird they come from a huge chain. I used to order on the app and pick it up, but if you order fries it's not worth it as you have to sit and wait for them to fry them while your burger sits in the bag. My wife and daughter have tried their grilled cheese and hot dogs and had no complaints. I like to get vanilla Coke at the big soda machines. They have some decent staff members right now in my opinion. A couple times in the past I was not so thrilled with the staff, but they are good the majority of the time."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys.  It's not the best burger you'll ever have but it beats McDonald's and all those other fast food burger joints any day. Most importantly, you can customize your burger (or dog) with a variety of toppings and sauces.  They have A1 and BBQ sauce for God sakes; a true sauce master's dream! Also, the fries are to die for; hot, salty, and fresh. Yum! Be sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"How does this place not have more 5 star reviews? This is the best place for hamburgers. Period. I prefer Five Guys over BLT Burger, Burger Bar, Holsteins, etc. Holy cow, I can't believe In-N-Out has more reviews!

I was prompted to write this review after reading a Travel and Leisure article on the best fries in the U.S. For me, the best fries I have ever had are at county fairs. You know, where the fries are hand cut, thick with their skins on? Fried on the spot and a ton of salt? Yessir! Well Five Guys fries are just.like.that. Only here you don't have to wait until the summer to get them. I like ordering the large and taking home my leftovers. I could eat them fr a whole week. And the burgers are awesome too. This is like, real meat, and really flame-grilled, not like BK flame-grilled. And the toppings you have to choose from? Holy moly! Super fresh, creative toppings! The hot-dogs are really good too. Hot dogs in this country are usually kind of bland; in Mexico they actually have flavor. The hot-dogs here kind of taste like Mexican hot-dogs. You can also get the toppings on your dog as well. Oh and the staff are really nice too. They are encounrged to sing while cooking and when you walk in the door they sometimes yell hello.

Enough said, go now. Man I just got hungry."}
{"text":"I walked in here at 12:15 on a Thursday- right in the middle of the lunch rush. But upon entering, I realized I was the only customer in the shop.  My first thought was \"where is everyone?\" I quickly learned.  $14.48. For a cheeseburger, fries, and drink.  Last time I checked, I could get a steak for that price. Now I believe that you get what you pay for- so I shrugged off the sticker shock, and started anticipating a killer meal. Had to be, right?
Burger: 7/10 tasted just like a burger from Wendy's- just with more toppings.
Fries: 8/10 - best part of the meal. Not the greatest out there though. 
Small drink: 5/10 (small here is $2-3?- why?)
Service: 6/10. Happy, friendly employees- but poor presentation. Food is handed to the customer in a greasy brown paper sack (think bad school lunches  in 3rd grade) and my burger was half in the foil wrapper, half hanging out in the paper sack. 

Long story short: I walked away feeling like I got ripped off.  (Management take note: that is not good). My $15 meal should have cost $10 (at MOST). So, if you want slightly above average burgers/fast food at silly prices, this is a great spot. If you want bang for your buck (who doesn't?) go to IN-N-Out. Maybe that's why they're always busy...."}
{"text":"Classic diner-style burgers and fries. If you're a fan of the West coast In-N-Out, you will probably like Five Guys and get into many heated debates on which is better."}
{"text":"Can't complain about my experience here. This is my second time at a five guys and sure to go back. I got a bacon cheese burger with jalape√±os and BBQ sauce and it was very good.  I didnt realize the regular was actually a double so I was pretty stuffed. Cajun fries were good until I got to the bottom where there was too much of the spice. More expensive than your average fast food spot but the quality is better."}
{"text":"I've never heard of or tried Five Guys before but found myself completely sold on the food.  The burgers here are a little overpriced and take a little longer to make -- but they are worth it all.  All of the toppings can be mixed and matched at no extra cost.  I enjoyed my burger with \"all the way\" toppings.  The only downside is that their fries are pretty generic thick-cut fries and nothing special -- but they do come in really large portions perfect for sharing.

I definitely plan on coming back and ordering multiple burgers each time to stock up for future meals.  Just keep in mind that their default burger comes with two patties, so you'll have to order the single patty explicitly."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Five Guys. Have heard about them, but never been before, so I took a drive and picked up a double patty cheeseburger with four toppings, a small fries and a chocolate shake. The burger was juicy and delicious and almost too much to eat. I'll try a single patty, next time. The fries were some of the best I've ever eaten. They put them in a small cardboard cup, put that into a paper bag, and then pour another scoop of fries on top of that. VERY generous. Finally, they have a number of flavors to choose from in shakes, and I went with plain chocolate but I will try another flavor next time. And there will DEFINITELY be a next time."}
{"text":"My heart flutters at the thought of this burger. Why is it so damn good? How does a squished up (read: never soggy) bun with too many ingredients for its own good just satisfy every expectation I could have for a burger? 

I'll tell you why. When you have fresh ingredients at your fingertips that are well prepared and seasoned, you get a better burger. And when they squish all those ingredients together in that foil, it doesn't matter what it looks like any longer because it's guaranteed to taste great."}
{"text":"Very good hamburger made from meat that was packed into a patty on site (or at least it looks that way).  Bun was lightly toasted too.  I do like the option of A-1 sauce.  Really good burger...but just isn't worth over 3 dollars for one patty.

The fries were cut into a good size.  I can't stand in-n-out style fries where you can't taste the potato.  The fries here I could actually taste potato...you know...the stuff fries are made from.  Unfortunately, these fries were still quite a bit too crispy for my tastes.  Additionally, they put WAY too much salt on them.  I assume they would be better if I ordered them without salt.

They have one of those fancy coke machines which is nice.  Unfortunately when I visited more than half the selections were unavailable.

This place isn't bad, but just isn't worth the $9 I spent on a small hamburger, small fries, and a small soda."}
{"text":"The only reason it's not 5 stars is because of the price.

This location is a lot less busy than the st. rose location.

The hamburger they use is hand packed and delicious.  The bacon is awesome.

Everyone loves to compare it against in-n-out so I will too.  The burger is just as good as in-n-out but you have the option of picking toppings.  Much more expensive than in-n-out though.  The real winner over in-n-out is the fries.  No shoestring gross crispy fries here.  Five Guys has fries that are actually thick enough to taste like fries and not just taste like vegetable oil."}
{"text":"Fries were quite better the last time I went.  I'm not overwhelmed by this place (though I am overwhelmed by the price) so I'll keep it at 4 stars.

Please see my other review for more information."}
{"text":"Ordered little bacon cheeseburger and little fries. Reasonable price. Like that you can pick whatever toppings you want. The fries were salty. There was a nice portion of crisp bacon. The burger was good. The place is way better than McDonalds. Yay peanuts."}
{"text":"I was SERIOUSLY looking forward to this place. i had hyped it up cuz other people had hyped it up. 

I tried the cheeseburger as well as the fries. I want to say, it was average. Nothing stood out, nothing special, nothing really different. And I think the reason my review is not too good has a lot to do with the price. It was very expensive for what I was getting. I'd rather go eat at In 'n Out for the similar experience but for cheaper. If I'm paying more than that, I expect better food. 

The fries were nicely flavored but were too soggy for me. I personally just like my fries crispy. 

Cool decor, and the free peanuts made up for the price and quality of food.
This was the first and possibly the last Five Guys I'll ever visit. if i go back, I'll try the secret menu or patty melt that someone yelp'd."}
{"text":"Vous aimez les bon gros burgers alors je vous conseil d'aller chez five guys... Le concept est simple vous ajoutez ce que vous voulez a votre burger en partant d'un base simple avec 1 ou 2 steack. Bon quand c'est votre premiere fois essayer de ne pas oublier le fromage ou autre sinon ca peut etre un peu sec.

Le service √©tait relativement rapide vu que tout est fait devant vous √† la commande. J'ai trouv√© que c'√©tait tres bon et j'avais je crois double quantit√© de frite car j'ai eu du mal √† finir. En plus de cela il y a des cacahu√®te en libre service si vous voulez.

Le gros defaut c'√©tait l'hygi√®ne de l'endroit. En effet avec les cacahu√®te il y en avait partout √†  l'etage... c'√©tait vraiment sale au sol."}
{"text":"I don't eat this stuff much.  I eat enough of stuff like this at literally every backyard cookout I go to so its boring to me but people seem to like it.  Burgers, fries, etc.  
Needed something on the fly so we got 3 burgers and 2 fries.  Kids working were nice but needless to say after 15 minutes of waiting 2 of the 3 burgers were wrong and I chucked them in the bin.  Total waste of 15.00 and my time.  The food wasn't even remotely what we ordered.  Almost wondered if we got someone else's order but there was no one else waiting and the ticket number matched.  They just need to read what people order and pay attention.  Just go to Wendys.  they will most likely get your order right and its way cheaper."}
{"text":"\"I hope you leave enough room for my fist because I'm going to ram it into your stomach and break your god-damn spine!\"


  I always keep this quote from Arnold in the back of my mind if I eat fast food.  Dont fill up, eat just enough.  Burgers here are pretty tasty.  Had one here after a 3 day bender of boxed wine and pumpernickle loaf.  Anything greasy would of tasted good at that stage I guess.  Heard the fries are good and the soda comes in 7,000 flavors if thats your thing.  Only time I drink soda at all is if there's vodka in it.  Thing I dig most about this place is that its off in the cut and the parking lot makes a great place to meet up with your dealer.  You may have an occasional Tremont yupster stoll by but they are too self absorbed to pay any mind that your buyin rocks from your dude Rahlo."}
{"text":"This place is always good. Seems pricey until you realize how much other fast food cost. A few extra bucks gives meaning \" you get what you pay for.\" We use to get Fat Burger until Five Guys opened this location. It just taste better and the fries are not like other places. A nice change to the regular choices. Double Cheeseburger everytime."}

{"text":"If this isn't your burger Mecca, their's still time to repent!  

Any way you want it with whatever you want on it. Fries are fresh and hot.. like Will Smith and Sharron Stone had a baby in Idaho!"}
{"text":"Peanuts are free when you come in there, but the peanuts seemed very low quality and often had a sour taste (burnt? bad?).  No thanks.
The fries were okay, and you get a ton of them.  Fry lovers should go here just for the fries alone, but I'm not a fry person myself.
The hamburger was okay--nothing wonderful.
The shake was okay only.
Meh...I really have had better, so I don't think I'll be back.
Can't figure out why people love this place so...just can't.  I don't get it myself."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and HUGE portions. The fries were not \"all that\" and I sure do wish they served shakes/malts. And the WORSE part is that they don't validate your parking garage ticket (which is directly below the venue). Hell even CVS validates tickets (after you buy a .50 cent candy bar or something).

All of that aside the burgers are top shelf (and full of calories)."}
{"text":"The burgers were cooked perfectly and the order was correct! More importantly, the service was AWESOME! We arrived 15 minutes before closing and the cashier & cook were very nice and courteous...even though they were closing soon they provided great service and did not rush our order.
Thank you to Kenya C and the cashier (sorry I forgot his name)."}
{"text":"Why is 5 guys so expensive??? Why their meat so tasteless???? I forgot i even got a burger, y'all hype the fries up too much they aren't that good.... I can't believe I paid $10 for a cardboard tasting burger and mediocre fries. The staff was nice tho"}
{"text":"I live in downtown Toronto for many years now & am always on the lookout for a great meal - HOWEVER - sometimes I walk into a restaurant that is somewhat lacking, as was the case with Five Guys. I had great hopes for this burger chain as I knew they were very popular in the states, though after eating there I was surprisingly disappointed..

      AVOID THE FRIES FROM FIVE GUYS !

The fries that I got from Five Guys were simply awful. I think I haven't tasted fries as bad as theirs in a long time. They tasted as if they came out of a freezer (even though they did not) & were then not fried properly, still being very \"undone\" on the inside. The fries were also salted like crazy (almost as if to cover up the bad taste of the fry itself). Even my own home made fries taste 100 times better (& I consider them relatively bad^^). Iv'e heard similar stories from friends & coworkers about their Five-Guys-fries experience, so it seems that my order was not an isolated event of food gone wrong.

Some other discoveries I\"ve made about the place:

- The very first time I stepped into Five Guys, I immediately turned around & walked out again even though I really wanted to try their food. The reason: the place smelled extremely & disturbingly \"greesy\". I couldn't believe how all the people inside could handle the unpleasant smell. However, the second time I walked in the smell was not as extreme (though it still lingered, bearably).

- The regular hamburger / cheeseburger tasted good. The taste somewhat reminded me of the taste of a big mac from McDonald's (not sure if that is a good or bad thing), though I must confess that I haven't eaten at McDonald's in a very long time.

- The regular hamburger was quite expensive. On top of that, it was a double pattied burger, which I found to be too much meat for my taste. One patty would have been completely fine / reasonable / better. (Note that I believe that the \"small burger\" contains only one patty - so if I would ever go again to Five Guys then the small burger would definitely be my choice of meal).

But yeah - overall I was quite disappointed with Five Guys, especially when considering that they are a large & well established franchise. I can only advise others to not eat their fries, though if you still want to try them be my guest & please let me know if/how you liked them. I always try to remember that taste is a matter of opinion. But honestly - the Five Guys fries were plain bad."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious and the cajun fries... oh my goss. Had a foodgasm from eating those fries. Literally. The peanuts are free so grab as much as you can. A bit pricey, but, worth it. Just go buy those fries and nothing else."}
{"text":"I come here when I am feeling a bit homesick; the Five Guys in the west village of NYC will always be my favorite location. My usual order is the little bacon cheeseburger (single patty) with  'everything' and jalapenos on top and a side of regular-sized cajun fries. Super filling, messy, greasy, but appetizing. I am always guaranteed extra fries to take home if I finish the burger. Fountain soda is available with free refills. The employees are pleasant. Peanuts for days...I often snag a small bag to take home."}
{"text":"J'ai eu la chance de pouvoir m'arr√™ter chez five guys pour un repas bien remplie de bonheur. La d√©coration du restaurant n'est pas tr√®s beaux √† voir. La propret√© est √† revoir. Le service √† la client√®le est agr√©able. Les employ√©s ont l'air de bien s'amuser √† travailler ensemble. Que dire de la nourriture? Sublime. J'ai pris un cheese burger all dresses avec des frites sal√©. Ma commande du cheese burger est all dressed. Dans mon burger, il y avait du champignons, oignons, cornichons, fromage, Mayo... ca ete un r√©gal!   Elle fait beaucoup de d√©gats en mangeant, mais elle est superbe bonne.  Le boeuf fait de 100% n'est pas fait au McDonald's ou burger King, c'est chez Five Guys que tu la trouves!"}
{"text":"Burgers are great...large portions of fries...you can easily share a regular burger with all the toppings and a regular size fries with someone. It's great location at the Outlet especially when it's busy inside to get away for a break! Staff is fun and friendly!"}
{"text":"Okay, generally good food and pleasant service overall.
Tonight it was not that.  
No baskets for the peanuts in either of the boxes.  I asked if they had any and they eventually put some in one of the boxes.
Order placed was slow in delivery.  
Three orders came in after the order I placed, with minutes in between, and I watched them get called and leave the building well before my order was ready.
My order:  one (1) small burger, plain, and one cheeseburger with catsup,  mushrooms, grilled onion, jalapenos and one medium french fry.

In case you hadn't heard before,  they are known for their large fry orders.
I got home to a small fry and my receipt shows i did pay for the medium size which is supposed to be enough for 2 - 3 people.

I also asked for nutrition information at the same time I was placing my order and the person taking my order showed me a card with what comes ON the sandwiches but was unsuccessful finding one so she asked another guy (the manager?!) behind the counter.  While he's scavenging to find one she walks to the other register to help another customer.  Not once does he acknowledge me or say anything to me about never seeing them in the store but he is digging around at the front counter just like she had done.
I ask if I can just pay for my order and that It'll be okay if they can put the brochure with my burgers to go.  He completes the payment transaction and then promptly disappears to the back room. 

So now I've waited for my order I ask again about the nutrition information brochure because there's nothing there.  Guy (manager?!)  once again disappears to scavenge for one, without saying a thing like \"ill be right back, i couldnt find one, maybe look online\"...,  -nothing.   A girl follows him into the back room after I ask IF they actually have them or am I standing just around waiting for the fries get cold.  She returns a few minutes later to tell me they don't have any.
The other questions i asked of the two that were at the counter went in one ear and out the other.  They looked at me as if to acknowledge my question but turned and walked back to pull napkins.  I was surprised to the point of shaking my head and laughing at the situation.
FWIW, I picked up son and hubbies food here and got myself a sandwich at Jimmy Johns.  Had much better service there too.

Oh yeah Five Guys, way to represent."}
{"text":"The epitome of American fast food. Using Red and White to induce hunger in their patrons, much like In N Out or MacDonalds. 

The unfrozen, hand shaped patties being fresh and large is a huge plus though, winning this place multiple \"best burgers\" around the country. And they are shy about telling you that either. Signs hand all around the perimeter of the store with various awards for best burger, fries, etc... they have received from small independent newspapers in their various cities. 

The ability to customize your burger with their ingredients list... Here is where the place stands out! With a fantastic list of toppings they dont charge extra for, and few they do. 

They also kick In N Out's ass with the lettuce they use in a Lettuce Wrapped Burger to save the carbs. Their lettuce rounds around the burger perfectly and is nice a crisp! For the lettuce wrap burger lover, this is your suggestion!

Of course, because of health reasons, this place can't receive higher than a 3 star though. You understand."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in after years of not eating there and it was just ok. 23 bucks for two burgers (one was a little) small fry and no drinks. Burgers fall apart easy and ok flavor. I do like all the topping options, wish they had other cheeses available. Fries were good. Did not like the taste it the food leaves in your mouth for the rest of the day though...probably will be another 5 years before we decide to try again. Many other places I would rather eat. They did have a very nice staff!"}
{"text":"We are done with this location.  Took my son here with his friends.  He is on sports teams so we bring some of the team here now and again.  He ordered a oreo shake.  It is about $5 so we expect something better than fast food.  I asked if it was real ice cream and was told it was.  When the shake arrived, it had no oreo in it and we could taste no flavor other than vanilla.  My son went up to get a replacement since it was not oreo, but 5 Guys just crumbled up 1 oreo on top and gave it back.  See the picture.  It was still not a oreo shake and the guy made no real effort to fix it.  See the picture - no even close to a 5$ shake.  Later I saw them pouring the liquid 'ice cream' from a plastic bag into a machine - so they lied about it being real ice cream as is used at places that use real ice cream to make shakes.  
As the final straw, my burger was completely soggy.  See the picture of the foil that is full of liquid.  How do you get this much water in a burger?  The bottom half of the burger was soggy and wet.  There are too many other good places nearby to waste your money at this location."}
{"text":"Their prices are way too steep for a very average burger. Not sure why everyone is so hyped up on this place."}
{"text":"Burgers and spicy fries are really good. Music is VERY loud. EXPENSIVE"}
{"text":"Five guys! So this place I've heard a back then and I love burgers so heck let's give it a shot. So I ordered a regular cheeseburger with lettuce mayo and cheese obviously (who doesn't get cheese). My burger comes and I take two bites out of it and I'm thinking.... what is up with my burger. I checked no mayo, oh my god. I didn't order too many topping and no mayo holy smokes. Hopefully it doesn't happen to anyone else but dang I wanted my money back haha."}
{"text":"Well, went there today, my 4th visit. Great burger and fries, however, two in my party became violently ill within an hour of eating there. Clearly it was food poisoning. It's 5:25pm now and both are still loosing it from both ends. I know this can happen anywhere but a big turn off, none the less."}
{"text":"Perfect for a 3am burger with friends after a night downtown. (it's open till 4 actually). The after bar crowd was getting hangry and it sure is good to have some late night greasy eats downtown. Burgers are big a bit sloppy yet equally satisfying. I did not go for the fries on my visit but a cheeseburger was just fine! Our visit the place was not spotless but in an acceptable level of cleanliness. If on a burger craving on St Cath it meets the agenda in an appreciated way. Don't expect gourmet burgers at Five guys. My perception Is it may not look like its Food channel photo pristine but tummy accepting in the end."}
{"text":"A tasty meaty burger.  Fresh fries and made to order.  Yes a bit pricey for a burger but good quality ingredients and fresh made to order are the difference."}
{"text":"I love their portions of fries and the quality of food but i feel they are overpriced . To get a \"combo\" it's almost 12 dollars. Most burger places don't have the toppings as free but most come with the burger in most places but maybe mushrooms and grilled onions.  The staff is very friendly and love that they have the endless possibility coke machine"}
{"text":"The service is nice as in the personality of the people. 
However, on a Friday night I'd expect more people working than just the two. 

Stopped by for the handcut fries and nothing else. 
I love they pour more in the bag since the cups are small. 

I love the ketchup dispenser still exists. 
The place appeared clean with a 100 choice Coke machine. 
Parking lot has a huge lip so if you're riding low - YOU WILL SCRAPE. 

The strip is really coming along as there's development on top of more development. 
The area has the mid20 vibe."}
{"text":"If you can indulge in a 1000+ calorie meal, make it a Five Guys Hamburger & Fries! Freshly made to order. Hot and perfect burger. Yummy fries. Just did not care for the futuristic coke machine - I was taste testing a few flavors before settling on the original Coke and my drink had an odd flavor to it...even after dumping 2 cups out. 
Loads of peanuts to munch on while they make your burger. Add another 200 calories for that;)"}
{"text":"This is a great location, the employees are super nice and greet you when you walk in, and the food is prepared hot and fresh. My only issue would be with the price of a combo but I guess you are paying extra for the freshness and service you just don't get at Wendy's or McDonald's, so I cannot hold that against them."}
{"text":"Super duper good burgers. Love this spot. Yes if you want a neat little burger go to the other place but if you want a huge fantastic messy burger this is the stuff."}
{"text":"I've been to Five Guys before and was not impressed but I just chalked it up to my palate not agreeing with their menu. My boss dragged me to this location for lunch and it was once again an epic failure. It was so smokey inside from the staff cooking the burgers that I thought the smoke alarm was going to go off. To make things even more annoying, the staff kept yelling and making unrecognizable noises, which quite frankly made it really annoying to eat there between that and the smoke. Once again the food sucks and as always was completely overpriced.  I have no problem paying a lot for good food or even just good service. I feel like this place is a waste of your time and money."}
{"text":"Lots of great things at Five Guys! I've been there today for the first time and the first thing that amazed me was all the toppings you could choose for no extra charge. The second thing was this amazing soda machine that has every soda you could wish for.
I got a cheese hotdog, my fiance got a bacon cheese burger, and we both got Cajun fries.
The hotdog was good, not overwhelming. Toppings definitely improve it greatly.
The burger was also good, yet not as great as In n' Out. Also definitely brought to another level by all the toppings.
The Cajun fries were the best fries I've had in years, not kidding. Great potato flavor, perfectly fried and the Cajun seasoning was spot on. And, big plus for me, they have malt vinegar to pour over them, if you have a weakness for that!
The restaurant was clean, had a charming decoration (covers of magazines that featured Five Guys, quotes about the food by famous people, and so on), the staff very friendly, and they had a wheelchair accessible table, which is very thoughtful.
Overall a decent place to eat, yet a tad pricey for the taste and size of the food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the burgers here!  Wide variety of toppings, fresh hamburger buns, and thick cut fries (the ones with the skins still on them! YUM).   The burgers are huge- if you want only 1 patty be sure to order the little burgers- the other traditional burgers come with 2 patties- holy meat.   Sadly they do not have ranch dressing- this is an essential part of my fry-eating ritual, and they do not have onion rings as a potential hamburger topping.    They have free peanuts in a huge box when you walk in line to order your food- which is great if you like peanuts- but all of you nut allergy people beware- this is an allergic episode waiting to happen!"}
{"text":"First... They have great burgers and fries. Second... When they found out I had to put my dog to sleep (cancer) they volunteered to make him a last meal for free..... Double cheese with bacon and French fries! The old guy loved it! 

Awesome customer service guys, I will be a lifetime customer."}
{"text":"I have gone to this spot a few times now it's always really busy at lunch... It's really loud in the restaurant I found it hard to order. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger Toppings A.1.¬Æ Steak Sauce, Jalapeno Peppers, Green Peppers, Grilled Onions, Grilled Mushrooms and a order of Five Guys Style Fries. Well you wait for your food to be called you can help yourself to free peanuts. I rate the experience as followed.

Bacon Cheese Burger - B+
Five Guys Style Fries - A+
Staff - C+
Peanuts - A

I like the free peanuts and the fries are some of the best on my list for sure... But the burger I was not blown away by... I am going to have to go back again and see if I can change my mind in the war of the burgers."}
{"text":"I like this place. Don't mind the stacks of potatoes and peanut oil so much. Kind of charming in a way. The reviews on the walls are a bit over the top. The Charlotte review they showcase has a revealing pic of Brooklyn Decker attached to it which I rather enjoyed. Completely love the fries but Dave is right about the huge amount you get. Weird thing to complain about I know but it's true. Too much of a good thing in that regard. Their hot dogs are really really good too. Overall tastes great but kind of pricey."}
{"text":"Why waste time ordering on line. It's never ready when you get there... Got to the store ontime and they didn't even start the order and there is no one in line. Then I ask them what's going on and they forgot to start the order!!! Seriously!"}
{"text":"Brought my Mom here for her first experience. Everything was great except for one minor mixup which was corrected.   I ordered a double and she ordered a single. When we got our order, the condiments I picked were on the single and my Mom's was on the double. I decided to mention this and asked if I could just get the extra burger. They apologized and said they would make a whole new burger for me and said they couldn't take the old one back. I asked for a bag and said I'd send it home for my Dad to try. The guy running fries heard this mentioned that he had some extra fries that we're going to be thrown out if I wanted those bagged to send home too.  So essentially we got 3 meals for the price of two and the staff was very courteous.  I thanked them and everyone was happy. Of course the food was hot, juicy and delicious as always. Mom really liked her first experience and thought the peanuts were a nice touch.

If you are looking for a quick burger a step above fast food but not quite a gourmet burger experience, you can't do any better than Five Guys!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. A lot of food for the money. Lots of choices for beverages. If you don't mind spending $10 for a burger lunch , this place is great."}
{"text":"Been going here since they first opened up. I believe it was the first Five Guys location in Toronto. They have reduced the patty size from when they first opened AND raised the price. Having said that, Five Guys is still one of my favourite griddle-cooked burgers because they're simple and fresh. Their fries are cooked in peanut oil which has become my favourite fries in the city too. Not many places use peanut oil. Only negative thing I can say is the price, a bit high even for all the food you get and unlimited pop refills."}
{"text":"After hearing all the craze about Five Guys, I decided to try it myself.  I honestly don't know why people give such raving reviews about it.  It is really just an average burger with average fries.  I've had way better burgers in the past.  It wasn't a horrible burger...but it wasn't spectacular.  just...meh...a-ok."}
{"text":"Veggie burger was very tasty and all the toppings are FREE and so are the peanuts. Staff was extrememly friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian so I don't come here often but when I do I always order either a grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes and fresh jalape√±os , and it is always good...the cashiers are always friendly, and the wait is usually minimal...everything is pretty organized. Occasionally I will get fries but they are very filling and too greasy for frequent consumption. My only complaint is really the size of the grilled cheese sandwich. It's very small compared to the size of a veggie sandwich (with more veggies, roughly the same price) at Jimmy Johns next door"}
{"text":"I have eaten here once, and it was so so good, I got a bacon cheese hot dog and my boyfriend got a hamburger all the way, with little cajun fries to share, and it was great! Most of the staff was friendly. We did have to wait a bit longer than usual for the food but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Five Guys is GREAT!

No extra charges for toppings and a mountain of fries!

The new soda machine rocks!"}
{"text":"Solid five guys.

The service is really good, and considering most of the customers are college kiddos, they treat us with a lot of respect.

The work culture is amazing, and not only does it improve their job, but also makes the customers happier as well.

Food is consistent like a five guys should be."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to a Five Guys Burgers and Fries.   We each ordered a.regular fry... That was a mistake, because that was way too much fries! They were delicious though. The burgers were excellent, too. The young man who waited on us was very friendly, and the restaurant was spotless. It was pricey for what is essentially fast food, but the food was definitely much better quality than other fast food."}
{"text":"We had a great experience. The cashier explained everything and was very friendly. My sister even asked if they could make her fries a little more crispy and it was no problem for them to do it and they even let us keep the fries we already had. Great service and the food was real and tasted awesome. Definitely will go there again"}
{"text":"I've accepted the fact Five Guys is a place where you seriously can't go more than once a month. It's so good, but you know the burger is so unhealthy it makes you feel rather sick just thinking about it after.

I tried this place and got my typical double cheeseburger with grilled mushrooms, onions, and A-1 sauce. I found it to be better than the one I tried in Mississauga, however it might have been the A-1 sauce, since I never added that over there. Both my mom and dad were satisfied with their burgers, being double cheeseburgers and relatively plain. We had a look at the bacon cheeseburger, and to be honest the bacon looked quite disappointing.

We also had the cajun fries, which tasted quite good and not so spicy! This coming from a person who can't take spice, period.

Service was good, but seeing how energetic the employees were it's to be expected.

Total came to about $42 with 2 drinks and fries. Oh well."}
{"text":"Giving this place a solid 4 stars.  The burgers are delish!  And I love that you can add any toppings you want.  I had the single bacon burger.  I thought the bacon was slightly well done but it did not take away from the burger in any way.  The burgers reminded me of old school burgers I had as a kid growing up.  And yes, I did think the burgers are better than In & Out.
The fries were super yummy and the small is enough to feed 2-3 adults.  Next time I will try the cajun fries.
The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars was the price.  I think it was a tad pricey for a fast food burger joint, no matter how much I enjoyed the burgers."}
{"text":"I'd been to Five Guys before in DC, but I didn't know there was a store in Charlotte until recently. Naturally, as soon as I found out I brought my girlfriend to partake in its glory. This place is awesome. 

Most fast-food places don't really give you a fresh feeing. Five Guys does. Their patties are handmade and their fixins are, well, fresh. Speaking of fixins, they're all free--you just have to ask. Definitely try throwing mushrooms, onions and jalapenos on your burger. Nice combo. 

And the burgers are huge--a regular cheeseburger is two delicious patties. If you're going with a friend, plan on splitting a side of fries, 'cause it a ridiculously huge order. Try your fries with malt vinegar; it's amazing. 

One thing: it's fast food, but since they cook the burgers right there in front of you, it's not all that fast. Plan on waiting a few minutes, at least. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Like other 5 Guys chains this location is just the same. Clean, friendly staff, fast service and fresh ingredients! Consistently good. We'll be regulars!"}
{"text":"I am quite disappointed with the reviews and to what I got! Super oily fries and regular drink for 17bucks"}
{"text":"My favorite burgers! Bacon cheeseburger all the way.  The Cajun fries are delicious and the atmosphere is casual and fun. I love this place."}
{"text":"my first time here. 13.00 for a burger sm fries and sm coke. not bad. but not phenomenal either. burger was ok even with ALL the toppings. fresh, home-style fries, kinda soggy, not my thing. There is absolutely no presentation here at all! I mean even at burger king at least you get a tray, here everything is tossed in a brown paper bag, the fries are \"served\" in a weird tiny paper cup but pretty much just thrown in the bag. I felt like a horse eating this meal, don't bring a date here. I will say everyone working here was warm and friendly and they serve free dried peanuts here, and the coke machine is amazing. The employees all have a friendly vibe. clean bright place too."}
{"text":"First time to the one in Las Vegas normally go to California ones and still just as good. The line was out the door but still got our food in five minutes. The employees were so nice, and made our order perfect."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have a Five Guys near us now. This is located in the plaza near Target, Jimmy John's, and the old Costco (now becoming a Winco). It is a classic Five Guys setup with peanut bags and all.

When we went, it was crowded but service was efficient. We sat in the back and enjoyed the music and watching people use the fancy new Coke machines. The burgers and fries were delicious and we enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"Take Five Guys for exactly what it is and it earns all 5 stars in my book. Despite what other reviewers think, THIS IS A FAST FOOD CHAIN! They just happen to use FRESH, quality ingredients instead of the crap you find at McDonald's or BK! You wanna compare it to something? Try In-and-Out. Which I also love. But being an East Coaster, my allegiance lies with Five Guys. 

I love the Bacon Cheeseburger with fresh cut jalapenos and grilled mushrooms, accompanied by the cajun fries!! YES, the regular burger comes with 2 patties! If that's too much for you to eat then order the Little Burger. Or eat as much of the Regular as you can and throw the rest out. It's not something to whine about on Yelp and deduct stars for. The same goes for the fries... yes they give you a lot... why is that a bad thing?

If you're looking for a fresher version of a fast food burger with plenty of FREE toppings to choose from, then Five Guys is right up your alley!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, nothing special but I thought this spot earns a solid 4-stars. It was my first time at a Five Guys, so I was probably more impressed than a return customer who knows the routine... Walking in, the place was bright and welcoming. The menu was posted above the register and simple enough to decipher quickly to place an order. The staff were super friendly, singing along with the radio every now and then, thanking us for visiting, etc. 

I had a bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions & mushrooms, mayo and ketchup. They had another 10+ ingredients to choose from -- usual suspects like lettuce and tomato and more exciting ones like green peppers -- all free of charge. The burger was good but the fries were really the star. Although, I'm not sure why they bother with the cup when they just dump double that in the bag. We had them with Cajun seasoning. Perfect amount of spicy! 

The communal peanuts were a fun touch, too. 

We were in and out of there in about half an hour. Great, affordable step up from your average fast food. The location in Plaza Midwood is super convenient. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just ate at five guys for the first time. Place was clean employees were good I am just rating this strictly to my pallet and burgers I have had in my life. Grease Frys, burger was bland. won't go back. Don't think this place is what people make it all seem to be. Just a chain and over priced one of that  burger with everything on it a reg. Drink and med. Frys $14.36"}
{"text":"Is this the best burger around? Of course not. But what if you want to get your burger to go, or get it in a hurry, or get in and out for less than 10 bucks? 

This place isn't in competition with DLUX, it's in competition with Wendy's. And it's at the top of its class by a million miles. I would love to hear if this so-called mediocrity stands if you filter out the gastropubs.

I like that it hasn't got the scrubbed and squeeky non-offensive corporate-aprooved atmosphere of the international giants. I like hearing the hipster college kids behind the counter talk to each other about their college hipster issues. I like the fresh meat and big variety of topping choices. 

Once a guy that works there made fun of me for being such a dork while he was off work walking with a date down State Street. But the same guy more than a year later, not recognising me, gave me a whole fry-basket full of fries because it was getting close to closing.  So my advice there is...I don't know... go when they're almost closing and don't be a dork? 

And don't be tempted to make your burger too messy. Not too many wet ingredients, and I don't recommend \"the works\". Just go with a few things you really like. The burgers don't need so many toppings anyway."}
{"text":"Dude. It's Five Guys. They have the best hamburgers and french fries ever! I may have ate there twice in less than a week... It's just so good! If you've never been to a Five Guys then you've never lived! Go! Now! Run!"}
{"text":"A pal and I came here for lunch yesterday.

We immediately noticed the really good service here. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. As soon as patrons left, there was a woman who came around to wipe down the table, ask how the meal was, and wish those patrons a good weekend. There was also another staff member who came around encouraging all to take some complimentary peanuts.

I ordered a Little Cheeseburger and my pal ordered a Little Hamburger combo (which came with fries). Having my burger go 'All the Way' made it quite tasty. The burgers here are quite large so you should be okay with ordering a Little Hamburger. In addition, if you're jonesin' for fries, one order is big enough for two people. 

I'm not sure when I'll be back as Ryerson or the Eaton Centre are not my usual hang-outs, but if I'm in the area (and I've exercised and ate well for the week) I might drop by again."}
{"text":"Five Guys keeps it simple. Four kinds of burgers (hamburger, cheese burgers, bacon burgers or bacon cheeseburgers), three kinds of hot dogs (kosher, bacon or cheese and bacon-cheese), two kinds of fries (regular or Cajun) and free toppings (including mayo, relish, onions - grilled or raw - lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, mustard, jalapeno peppers, green peppers, A1, barbecue sauce and hot sauce).
The burgers are juicy and delicious, the bacon is cooked just right and the thick cut fries, although a tad greasy are some of the best I've had in any restaurant.
The place is open, airy and teems with the sounds and smells of a popular burger hot spot. The only unusual aspect of Five Guys are the peanuts. They're free, but they don't seem to go with the image of bustling, neighborhood burger restaurant.
One of the best affordable burgers in Vegas."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'll make this short and to-the-point. It's like any other Five Guys in that the burgers (in my opinion) are good but DEFINITELY overpriced. I mean you can get a burger at In-n-Out (tastes just as good) for half the price. The Coke Freestyle machine is bomb though, gotta have my Coca-Cola Orange and Peach Fanta (not mixed haha). I would give the place a 4-star rating except for one thing--WHERE ARE THE PEANUTS?! Definitely not the same vibe as the one on Mill Ave. Disappointed, but will probably eat there again in the future."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a double cheeseburger with no bun (wrapped in lettuce) and extra mushrooms.  I still perfer In and Out for the food and price."}
{"text":"At first I was a big fan but over time I found myself not liking their burgers as much. I do like that they put fresh jalapenos in their burgers. I've had better. I think Hero's is better."}
{"text":"Excellent hand cut fresh fries and they don't skimp! The burger was great with all my favorite toppings that I chose. Extra friendly service and clean. Bit pricey but it is Vegas."}
{"text":"Fast food or gourmet burgery? They make your burger fast enough, but it is not your typical fast food burger.

I have eaten at other locations, but this was my first time at this one. I got the bacon burger, all the way with peppers, and shared fries with my friend. You definitely need a fork to eat the burger, because as I was eating all the toppings started to fall out. The fries were unfortunately oversalted.

Service was nice enough, they greet you as you enter and say goodbye as you leave. I like how one of the guys kept shouting things like \"good job team, keep it up, etc.\" as they went through making the orders. But they should be more aware that it is an open kitchen and that we can hear everything else they say.

FYI you can get your burgers with no bun ala \"protein style\". Ask for extra lettuce."}
{"text":"Good burger and fries. Order the single patty with cheese and the works (lettuce tomato grilled onions and of course added bacon.) The fries were hot and fresh and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Ive only been here once, but it'll probably be my last. Nothing special about this place. I ordered a burger, fries and a coke and it cost me around $10. The food was good, but if im paying over 10 bucks for a burger combo i want a happy ending before i walk out the door. I would suggest trying it once and see if you fall in love with the place, but for me, its not worth the price. i would just as soon go to in n out."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Five Guys by some friends down in Jacksonville, FL.  I then ran into it again at the DCA airport while delayed for a flight home once and it helped me to be less crotchity towards the gate agents.  Then I realized that these Five Guys were all around me as I suddenly ran into one on Walnut Street in Philly and then another out near Lester,PA.
The one on Mill Ave that recently opened echoes the same simple goodness that the others do.  Good burgers and fries.  I actually like them a little more than In and Out Burger but that could be because of my east coast bias.  I think I like most that it is like a burger you or I could make and serve with nothing too fancy.  A little pricey, I still don't mind because of the meat quality.  Mounds of fries are a signature.  I give them 4 of 5 because I do think they could do a few bargain deals on the price."}
{"text":"5 stars for this Five Guys. Everybody is always so friendly and their burgers always hit the spot. They are kind of pricey though...just about $20 for two drinks, one fry, and two \"little cheeseburgers\""}
{"text":"What's so great about this place? Many of my friends claimed Five Guys to have the best burgers and fries, but it was mediocre to me. Okay burgers, but I will give them credit for all the topping choices. I'd compare Five Guys' burgers to In N Out's. Not too worth the price. Fries were just A-OK as well. Nice having a large choice of drinks as well.. Nothing too special. I only come here because I'm often at the froyo store next to it."}
{"text":"Five guys is better than in & out that's is all flavor in fries and burgers as well as topping selection and food for your buck"}
{"text":"I used to be an In-N-Out fan but Five Guys is now my new favorite new fast food burger joint.  I think Five Guys gives you a good value for its price. The food is fresh and you can choose from a variety of toppings (from mushrooms to peppers) to add on your burger. Also, their fries are pretty good, though they are not as unique as In-N-Out's or McDonald's; I recommend ordering the seasoned ones.

Be sure to tell them you want a \"little\" hamburger or cheeseburger or they will give you a double patty burger."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. I love eating here. The people are always so pleasant and energetic. The fries are excessive and that's the best. Haven't ever left here feeling hungry nor short changed."}
{"text":"All around good food. Had the bacon cheeseburger and it was pretty tasty. And depending where they get the potatoes, the fries are a hit or miss. Love the peanuts!"}
{"text":"Went in just after 1 o clock and it was wonderful. Friendly service, fast order time, and prices in line with any other upscale fast food joint. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best seasoned bag of fries in Las Vegas. But that's pretty much all this place have to offer for me. I love the free peanuts while waiting for my food. Just be sure to try to throw away your shells. Trust me, Arvin T. tested the theory of throwing shells on ground as adding to the decor. Embarrassingly failed. 

I never add sauce or fillers to my burgers but here I have to. The meat is super-well done hence dry. You definitely want to add BBQ sauce, or mayo, or something to your burger to make it better. 

If I had a choice, I'd go to In and Out for my burgers and Five Guys for my fries."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to my last review I give it 5 Stars the burger optional choices are excellent the fries are excellent the soda fountain is superb but takes a little getting to know how to use it but it's worth it after you understand how it works it is the best soda machine around. The manager came over to my wife and I and asked us how we liked the meal we loved it and asked if he could get us refills from the soda machine which are free. While waiting for the food to be cooked they have free peanuts all you can eat which was a very nice touch if you're kind of hungry before your meal.l Not many places like this place the prices are worth the food"}
{"text":"First time at a 5 Guys nice burgers and the staff is high energy and fun people here . I well be going to other 5 Guys too compare stores too this one . I well follow up over time ."}
{"text":"Munching on peanuts as I wait for my food is a food is a good idea. I like the peanut idea. I only try their veggie burgers since I don't eat beef. It would be nice if they had a chicken option. However their veggie burger is very delicious, for what it actually is. There is no patty it is just all the veggie toppings that are on a regular burger with the sauces. My favorite part is the saut√©ed onions and jalape√±os.  The fries are similar to NY fries and a regular is good enough for two people.

The reason I am giving it a three star is because for what you get, it is a little pricey. May be a good chunk of the money for the food goes towards hiring someone to clean the peanut shells of the floor."}
{"text":"If I have to wait ten minutes for my burger to be cooked to order, why can't they cook it to order? Why does it have to be well done? Why can't they have cheddar, provolone, or Swiss? Why are the mushrooms canned?"}
{"text":"I love that you customized your own burger. What else can you ask for?! Everything is delicious! Its a must for burger lovers!"}
{"text":"GO ELSEWHERE. Not like other Five Guys. Management is incapable of preforming simple math. I stood in line for 30 minutes and when I get to the register I'm told they're out of food. Really? Out of everything? Burgers, Hot Dogs, Fries, Beverages? Everything? For the record I had been leaning on one of the MANY bags of potatoes (also known as food). Apparently doing a simple head count of customers in line at some point and counting the \"food\" in the fridge and comparing the numbers is beyond their ability. I'm probably not being fair to the occupationally challenged. I mean, they literally flip burgers for a living."}
{"text":"Great fries!  Fast service, very good burgers an sandwiches.  A veggie burger would be nice but the veggie sandwich & grilled cheese are nice choices.  Cool decor with plenty of clean tables."}
{"text":"Was in the area with a colleague and we were both getting hungry for lunch. I hadn't been to a five guys in a few years so I thought I'd give it another shot. 

Overall, it was mediocre. The place was clean and the staff were polite enough. But I just don't dig their burgers. I don't find them to have much flavor and they get soooo soggy. The fries were ok, nothing special. 

With so many great burger places in Vegas, I'm just not inclined to go back."}
{"text":"I'd been to this location before, but this last time was the most disappointed I'd ever been with a Five Guys restaurant. I had ordered grilled onions, but they came uncooked. The buns were stale. The shake was thin and low quality. We ordered a large fry and there were barely any extra fries in the bag, which is not normal! They usually add an extra scoop into the bag, especially for a large fry.

Aside from all that, the food is usually delicious and plentiful. I hope they were just having an off day."}
{"text":"My father in law raved about 5 guys so hubby and I went there before the movie on Saturday night... All I can say is my father-in-laws tastes buds needs to be adjusted!! My burger was basically split in two parts , the buns were cold and the french fries were on the cool side and little greasy. If I have to choose between 5 Guys and the Freddy's that just opened in the same parking area.... I will choose Freddys. If I want a really good hamburger I will go to Smash Burgers!"}
{"text":"Woohooo finely at five guys burgers and frys! Food is awesome way better than any other burger place in northeastern Ohio!"}
{"text":"I'm not really much of a burger person, but these are so good!  My son, who is the ultimate burger lover,  rated these in his top 2! Very Friendly staff and clean! Also, they have the coolest pop machine ever and the music rocked!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty much done with fastfood with the exception of Chipotle and Five Guys, or if I'm on the West Coast, In and Out Burger would replace Five Guys on the list.

5 Guys burgers are very tasty and they give you that extra scoop of fries in the bag.  Not to mention the self serve Freestyle Coca Cola fountain. Beef patties have no fillers or preservatives. You won't  get those smelly burger fingers you get from other places either.

Is a bit pricy. You'll  dump about $50 on a family of four here."}
{"text":"Defiantly a fan, I have heard nothing but great things about this place but always forgot it was there until we were at the target and starving! I like the whole retro burger shop feel, and I like that the burgers come bare and you tell them what you want on it, I'm sick of having to say no onions and then even reading it on the receipt, only to get home and have an onion burger in front of me. Free peanuts are a plus too. 

I wasn't a life changing experience but it it defiantly great to have a solid burger joint down the street from us if we ever want a quick meal. I'll drive past a McD's for that any day."}
{"text":"They got my order wrong the first time so I called and spoke to a manager named nhut. He put my name on a list to come back and my order would be free.  Thanks to verma and the manager on duty josiah. I got my burger the right way and i got a free fry and drink.   Great location. Just a little stressful for them when its busy lol"}
{"text":"I love their burgers and fries. Only issue I have seen is that they cook their fries in peanut oil. For those, that have peanut allergies this becomes an issue. My son wasn't a happy camper since he's allergic to peanut and complained the whole time that he couldn't eat the fries. For a party of 10 hungry guys the two large fries was more than enough for us. I think next time I have to order the regular sizer since they give you double the portion. 

I typically like to get the regular cheeseburger which comes with 2 patties, mushrooms, bacon, grilled onions, with mayo and ketchup. Love this place."}
{"text":"Food is always good but the people who work here are not nice at all. First thing is that they only have 2 people working on a Friday night. As we are waiting to order a lady behind the grill says what can I get started for y'all. Me and my boyfriend both said we were getting burgers so I guess she dropped two pattys on the grill. Then when she walks to the register she says so you guys both want little burgers , we said no we want the regular ones , so she says \"that's why I asked you guys what you wanted\" and then calls back to the other guy to put more pattys on the grill. I understand you might be busy but you don't treat customers that way.  Pay and look at my recipient and she only charged me for a little burger but I got the double one, so maybe she wasn't so bad at all"}
{"text":"We always come here when we have a burger craving!!! Employees are always friendly, and service is quick. Food is fantastic every time. My boyfriend and I will usually always get a burger for each of us, a large Cajun fry, and large drink to share. Came here tonight I think they were training a new employee on the register, over heard them telling him he had to make sure he always says hello and welcome etc which i love because I personally tell my own employees the same thing. I think it's important to always have a smile on your face and greet customers as soon as they walk in your store! :)"}
{"text":"I try not to rate things as 5 star often, but Five Guys certainly is just that. Ordering the food takes so getting used to, but the cashier is very helpful in explaining all the specialty terms used. And watching them cook your fresh hamburger and fry those oh-so-delicious fries; once you've tasted them you'll be back."}
{"text":"I was told this place is great so i decided to stop by. I was very dissatisfied. I got the burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles and grilled onions. My burger bun was so soggy, it was wet, and i didnt have any sauces in my burger. Burgers should not be wrapped in foil if its to go because it traps moisture . Also, my fries were soggy and looked like they had been an old batch of fries. Or maybe the blanching process wasnt done correctly. Was it this location that didnt follow five guys guidelines? Was it that i got it to go? Or were the cooks having a bad day? Whatever the case, it left this guest unhappy. Im about giving second chances so i might stop in and eat at the restaurant rather than getting it to go. Or i could just go to a place i know will get it done right."}
{"text":"OK... I admit it... I *occasionally* stop into this Five Guys after I leave the nearby YMCA. Given the caloric intake I know I'll be subjecting my waistline to, I limit my visits to post-killer workouts... and I always skip the ginormous serving of fries.

This location is clean and has prompt, friendly service. This location lives up to the standards of good service & food I've come to expect from Five Guys."}
{"text":"Extremely nice service!  Greeted promptly and order went smoothly.  Food was great especially the fries. I wish they had more condiments for fries (ranch, cheese, mayo) since they give you so many. 

Why i love it here :
**You can share a large fry between 2-4 people! 
**unlimited toppings on burger! 

Restaurant could have been cleaner. Or table was kinda greasy"}
{"text":"The burger is good but not astoundingly good (unlike Carl's Jr). But then burgers here are fried and at Carl's Jr grilled so maybe they're not worth the comparison. 
Anyhow I appreciate the plain beef patty not being flavorful, for the lack of sodium. Apart from that, I think the burgers compete alright.
What's astoundingly good here is their fries (both flavors). They taste like real and freshly chopped potatoes."}
{"text":"On my opinion, this place is excellent! I love their burgers, nice and big and greasy! Tons of toppings to choose from at no extra cost. The fries are really good and the amount of fries that you get is great! The reason for 4 stars is the pricing. Paying over $20 for burgers, fries and pop is kinda ridiculous IMO. I would recommend five guys to anyone because of the food. If you are on a budget, there are other places with good burgers that is cheaper."}
{"text":"Since Airdrie is only 10ish minutes for us we decided to head to Five Guys Burgers and Fries for supper one night. 

The fries could have been better...they were not super crispy as we expected but still edible. The burgers were outstanding.  I love the build your own concept with countless topping choices.

We love burgers so much so we've been back a couple of times, usually grabbing takeout, sometimes eating in.  Hubs always gets the cheese/bacon double patty burgers with a few simple toppings.  I typically get the works on a single burger since I love how gooey and messy it is.

Five Guys delivers and with several new burger joints in town ya gotta go big or go home!!"}
{"text":"For a fast food franchise, 5 Guys has some tasty juicy burgers. You can get it your way with toppings that suit you.
I like the Little Cheeseburger with lettuce, mayo, ketchup, and grilled onions.
If you're going to cheat, this is a good place to do that because you'll leave satisfied and knowing you did something bad but ohhhh soooo good!
Oh and love the cool space aged drinking machine with every kind of soda plus they have my favorite green tea! Hi five to 5 Guys!"}
{"text":"Came here for a couple of burgers and fries, it is a \"burger & fries\" restaurant! it's 20 minutes before closing and the employee tells us they stop serving fries at 9:30!!!  Shouldn't it be advertised that you can only get burgers and who else knows what the managers want to serve off the menu at whenever times they want? Even out of bacon, half hour before the scheduled closing time! if that's not terrible service, than I don't know what is!!! this is obviously not the best burger by all means by the \"advertising\" all over the restaurant!! at least be good at customer service, and serve what you advertise and on the menu during \"posted\" operating hours! The owner should really double check on how to keep a business going and instill that knowledge to his/her management! Customer Service should always be first on any successful business, everything else follows. If you're an employee and are so worried about cleaning out your equipment (fryers, etc) and want to go home early, than maybe it's not entirely your fault, but obviously your managers and of course the owners fault!"}
{"text":"Great burgers live here!  Good tasting beef and lots of toppings including saut√©ed mushrooms and onions!!!   My favorite side is the Cajun fries....so yummy especially dipping in their hot sauce."}
{"text":"I eat here often, it is near my house, I like the burgers, and the fries, but I cannot rate it better because :

The price. In and Out burger taste just as good. Granted the burgers are larger at Five Guys, and you get a ton of fries (which are good) however, when I spend 15 bucks for a burger, fries, and a drink, that is a bit much. That is more than if I had went to Ruby Tuesdays and had a triple prime, which I love.

My other complaint is the packaging. The brown bag does not cut it. It makes the food messy and hard to extract because they pile the fries on. The peanut thing is kinda gross as well, anything that is Communal typical means dirty.

The music is always good, I never ate there where I would describe it as \"blaring\" like one reviewer, and I am a pretty quiet person. I typically read a magazine while eating there, and the volume does not distract me.

If they dropped the price by maybe.....half....it would be killer, but the price is what kills it for me."}
{"text":"First of all, any place that sells Cherry Coke out of the fountain gets an automatic 4 stars from me at the very least. I don't care if you don't like it, that's just how it is.

I was really nervous about going to this place after the Smashburger disaster. The Smashburger disaster of course was when me and the rest of Tempe getting super excited that a supposedly legit burger place was coming to downtown Tempe, then I got there, and it was horrific. A patty and bun essentially served in a pool of grease, horribly over-seasoned fries, and a stomach ache that ruined my afternoon.

Needless to say, I was a little hesitant to get my hopes up for a new over-hyped burger chain near my office.  That said, I was actually pleasantly surprised with Five Guys when I went there for lunch today. Yes, like a moron, I went there on their very first day open, always a dangerous move mind you, so of course it was slammed. However, the place was very well staffed and they handled the crowd no problem.

Basically the deal is you get hamburgers, cheeseburgers, or bacon burgers, one or two patties, and a large selection of toppings, all which are free of charge. You also can either get Regular Fries or Cajun Style Fries.  The burger was juicy and flavorful. The Cherry Coke was as magical as you'd imagine, and the Cajun fries honestly kind of sucked. No real flavor to them and they were a little limp but boy did they give you a ton of them.  Luckily for them, I was still mesmerized by that heavenly Cherry Coke, but I digress...

Five Guys is by no means gourmet or fine-dining, but it is a very welcome addition to my DT Tempe lunching routine."}
{"text":"The burgers here are actually good! They use excellent quality of beef, very juicy. The fries are meh. They also give you way too many fries, but I guess if you really like them that's a plus! I always enjoy eating the free peanuts that they offer before eating your meal."}
{"text":"Tried the Bacon Double Cheese Burger topped with lettuce, tomato, pickles, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, green peppers, and mustard. Also had the Regular Fries

The Good News:
The burgers had a nice charbroiled flavor and cooked well as advertised.
The cheese and the toppings were tasty and plentiful. I liked idea of crumbled bacon instead of strips.
I would agree with the published reviews that their fries are the best I've had at a fast food hamburger franchise. The serving size was also generous and a good deal and I liked eating my fries from the cup, which made it easier to add plenty of ketchup the way I like.
Enjoyed munching on the free peanuts while we waited for our order.
Service was quick and pleasant.
Their drink dispenser, what I have decided to call a \"Coke Replicator\", was cool.

The Rest of the Story:
The burgers were not juicy as advertised and, therefore, not as flavorful as some other fast food franchise hamburgers.
The bacon on my burger was overcooked and, therefore, did not add as much flavor to the sandwich as I would like.
The green peppers would have been better grilled like the other toppings.
The bun was rather limp and not what I would have expected from a place like this.

The Verdict:
The most important reason for going to burger joint is to enjoy a juicy, flavorful hamburger and that was not achieved. The fries compensated a lot, but not enough to make it a truly memorable experience. I do intend to try at least one more location."}
{"text":"lets start with the good....peanuts, good fries, good selection of teas, decent burgers and grilled mushrooms. things not as good, they are a little pricy for only a \"decent\" burger (looking at close to $10 pp for meal) with no table service and coke products. of course that isnt a negative if you like coke. they are really kind of like an expensive in-n-out with peanuts. i wouldn't avoid them if someone suggested them but i don't think they will be a a regular for me. think if i wanted to pay extra for serve yourself i would choose fudruckers or fatburger instead. would have given them two stars but think the peanuts earned them the third."}
{"text":"Good food, super friendly staff here.  If you need a burger fix, check 'em out!"}
{"text":"I have to bump this up to 3 stars because I've eaten here more than once. Still a bit steep in price, as I prefer in n out in every way over this place at half the cost but the bigger is solid here."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly service! Delicious burgers! And Breanna M. makes the BEST Cajun fries!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm hooked to this place! Awesome burgers and generous servings of fries. Forgot to mention their soda fountain, it's the bomb!!!

I've been to a lot of overpriced burger joints here in town. They're cheap and beats In-N-Out by a wide margin. This is probably the best I've ever had! :)

PS

The first one I've been to was the one at Premium Outlet South. Let me remind you that you definitely need to spend at least 30min working-out before going to Five Guys... LOL"}
{"text":"Seeing as how bacon cheeseburgers are one of my favorite dishes in the universe, I'm probably a bit biased and more judgmental of my burger feasts. I'm kiiiind of a burger snob.

With that being said, Five Guys Burgers and Fries gets it. Everyone wants good seasoned burgers, crispy bacon, mounds of cheese and greasy spicy fries. AMIRITE!?

Well, at least that's what I like - an artery clogging meal that is filling and satisfying. Just as long as you don't eat here every week, I see no harm in indulging every once in a while.

Nothing but great things to say about the food, the workers and the location!

A little tip: be sure to add jalape√±os to your burger & order the Cajun fries for stomach churning night adventures. NO REGRETS!"}
{"text":"Five Guys offers a decent greasy fast-food burger with plenty of options for fixings.  It's better than most of its competition, but I would still prefer to pay a few more dollars for a higher quality burger.  Something that also irks me about the way all Five Guys operate is how everything is wrapped up and bagged to go.  I'm not Mr. Environmentalist, but it is a little sickening to see how much waste the restaurant puts out.  Why did I need a paper bag and aluminum foil if I am dining in?

The employees were friendly and welcoming, but they did screw up my fianc√©'s order.  She said \"no pickles\" but ended up pulling a good four or five slices out of her order.  At least they got the \"no mayo\" right.

Kudos to this...  I'm glad to see that Five Guys finally offers a small order of fries.  I never understood the whole regular and large, with the regular being enough to feed four or five people.  Thanks for helping me save a few bucks and keeping me from wasting a lot of food when I throw half the order away."}
{"text":"Good burger, awful fries, high prices. Since I appear to be the only person I know not on the Five Guys bandwagon, I decided to give this location a try. I'm still not jumping on board. 

There's nothing wrong with the location. Cityscape is a great spot in downtown Phoenix. Perfect for the busy lunch crowd, and Five Guys is open for dinner and on weekends. For a fast food burger in this area, it pretty much is as good as it gets. The location is very clean and the staff was very friendly. My walking distance options are Five Guys and McDonald's; Five Guys is always going to win that fight. 

As I stated earlier, the burger itself is good. I learned my lesson from the Scottsdale location, and ordered the Little Hamburger this time. It's a good size and not too unreasonably priced, but still more than I want to pay for a quick service meal. The huge amount of toppings are wonderful (but I cannot figure out how all the toppings are free yet cheese is an additional 60 cents). It's also a little too messy and greasy to me, but that's probably what appeals to others. 

The big problem I have with Five Guys is the fries. Why is there no small? The amount that comes in a regular order is way too much. While you certainly get the value of what you pay for in the quantity, there should be a smaller and cheaper option. You also do not get the value of what you pay for in quality. This time I experimented with the Cajun Fries. Just awful. Way too overseasoned and soggy. I left out the cup so my coworkers could finish them off. Not too many people seemed interested. 

A little more than seven dollars for a burger and an unnecessary amount of fries. No drink (had water back at my office). More money than I want to spend on greasy fast food. But (if you didn't get enough food), there's also complimentary (very salty) peanuts you can gnaw on, too."}
{"text":"Everyone on the planet has been telling me that I have to try Five Guys. Well, I happened to be at the bookstore in the Waterfront right next door to Fashion Square Mall, and I was a little hungry, so I figured it was a good a time as any to try it. 

I'll agree that this may be the best fast food burger. (at least much better than In-N-Out). It's massive, and tasty. There's also a good selection of toppings to put on it.  The fries are decent. I thought they were a little too salty, and I would've preferred a smaller size. They only have two sizes and the smaller one is probably enough to feed four or five people (or one really fat person, who am I to judge at a burger joint?). I definitely only made it a small portion of the way through. It was more than enough food for any one person. 

So why only three stars when most people would give Five Guys four or five? One big sticking point is the price. I paid more than $11 for a burger, fries and a drink. Although the place is high quality, it's still fast food, and it's not what I expect to pay for a fast food burger.  I don't mind paying for good food, but I didn't leave thinking it was worth that price.

The other is that I have to go into the mall's food court to eat here. That pretty much means the only way I'm going back is if I happen to be in the mall again. There's too many great restaurants in the area that I would much rather eat at before going back to Five Guys."}
{"text":"So a Five Guys opened up near my neck of the woods.  I guess it had to happen sooner or later.

I'm not really sure if there's anything I could say most people who have ever eaten at a five guys don't already know.  If you haven't been initiated into the quick service world of Five guys here's a rundown of the concept:

It's a good fast food burger, albeit a little pricier than it should be.  The difference between a regular burger and a little burger is two or one patties.  The fries are huge (even the small).  The soda fountain is one of those cool touchscreen machines that has a million options.  Peanuts are left out for customers to enjoy as many as they like.

What I like about Five Guys over it's competitors is the availability of online ordering.  Why wait in line?  You can log on to the website, enter exactly what you want, then walk to the pickup counter and be on your way with your food."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger. I love In n Out, and I think this one is better. The topping choices are unbeatable, the Little Burger is plenty for an adult, and tastes really good.  Fries are excellent, although I prefer In n Out's more. 

Coke machine is awesome. Coke Zero Cherry Vanilla is my personal favorite.

Improvements: more condiment choices at the counter. Only ketchup available at the counter seems skimpy. Maybe decreases the clutter but different types of mustards, relish, maybe peppers would be a nice addition. I understand you can order it but I would have preferred to put the sauces on myself.

Overall an super burger."}
{"text":"Five Guys Burgers...  It's alright.  The food tastes good, and they pour the fries right into the paper bag your burger comes in.  I guess this is supposed to be \"awesome\" but when you get right down to it, it's rather obnoxious.  There are many things I like more that ripping open my greasy paper bag in a specific way, so as the fries don't spill everywhere.  For example, I like being able to take a container of fries out of my bag, and then take the burger out, and proceed to eat in an orderly fashion.

End of the day, the basic Five Guys burger tastes just like a Whopper.  That's it.  That's all it is.  Except rather than being 2 dollars on Wednesday, it costs a fortune."}
{"text":"Great burgers, cajun frys are awesome, the drawback, is trying to get to you burger in the togo bag with all the hot frys on top of it."}
{"text":"I am not the biggest fan of fast food ever. But I really like Five Guys and this location is superb! 

They have really yummy fries and they give you so many! Like your bag overflows with the greasy buggers. Say what? Yeah they are really greasy. But good!

The burgers are really quite the bang for your buck too! Not the best burgers in the world but it is fast food not gourmet burgers. Be considerate for what you are eating and enjoy it for what it is. 

The pop machines are radical. You can pretty much have flavoured any beverage you like. 

The staff here is really friendly and that is a plus anywhere you go!"}
{"text":"Def don't waste your time.. Meat was undercooked. Burger very sloppy. Fries extra salty.. My first time having their food and I was not impressed- I won't be going back.."}
{"text":"In my last several visits, Five guys has been great and I've had no complaints but tonight is a different story.  The tomatoes on my burger were green in the middle and hard and crunchy.  The burger, after 4 hours, is still just sitting in my stomach like a rock.  And the fries that are normally great, were limp and unsalted.  

Also i accidentally filled my cup with sweet tea and topped it off with the unsweet instead of the other way around.  Man that was pure sugar.  How do people drink sweet tea like that?  They should really call it Sugar water with tea color.  Ugh.

No it's not going to stop me from going back because during the week they seem to be better but man, this time it hurt!"}
{"text":"Like many Five Guys, this location gets quite busy.  The burgers are big and juicy and built to your specifications.  The fries are great but they tend to be a little too salted here.  

The staff is friendly but it gets a bit loud in here where the staff really needs to speak up or use the mic which they don't always do.

Overall a decent place in a busy strip mall."}
{"text":"While the East Coast vs West Coast rap battle of the 90's has since past, it still rages on for some when it comes to Five Guys vs In & Out.  To me, yes they have the exact same concept and similar menus, but there is no comparing the two.

Fair warning, if your allergic to peanuts, this is not a place for you. They cook in peanut oil. On the bright side, Five Guys is excellent for those who can only eat Gluten Free. The fries have a dedicated fryer, and you can get your burgers, shall say protein style. In & Out is better in their protein style because of the way they prep the lettuce. Five Guys has shreds of lettuce that they sort of make a burger sandwich. Usually if you add extras on, everything ends up falling out and you are left with a huge mess.

One of the biggest downsides to Five Guys in the calorie count. Ohio, you would think twice if you actually saw the calorie content next to the menu items.

Overall, the service was Friendly and quick. The place was clean and I really didn't have any complaints. Great place for a quick bite to eat, if you want to go on the lighter side, I would recommend the \"little\" options."}
{"text":"Walking into five guys before the movies, I wanted a quick meal. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with just a few toppings. It seams like it was rush hour and maby short staffed. It was dirty in the dining area, so that made it hard for me to find a seat. The drink station was a complete mess and the ice machine wasn't working properly. As I sat and observed everyone. The cashier who took my order and many more to come was very energetic and well mannered, his name is Jordan. No complaints there. As for the rest of the team, they need to speed up as it took 18 mins for my food to get into my hands. The person cooking the food was extremely slow, with no hair net. From what I can see, same goes for the black shirt female, who I'm guessing was the manager for the night. Overall everyone was slow and took to long to get people's orders out. I will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"It's a good burger, not a great burger.  I like that you can customize the toppings to your liking.  The cajun fries are tasty and they're enough to feed three people.  Overall, Dotty's make a better burger, hands down."}
{"text":"The interiors are good and the staff are fun to watch... its almost mesmerizing.

The food itself is really oily and only good when eaten fresh - saved some fries and it was totally not the same (you know how macdonalds fries are sort of still addicting when cold? these arent).

Found it to be quite expensive for such a slim patty.

Would totally give it another star if they brought milkshakes to the menu!! I crave them as soon as I walk in."}
{"text":"I've been to 5 Guys in Seattle and recently visited one in Las Vegas. Their burgers are good but I feel that the entire chain is over-rated. The fries are average. The prices are too high for what you receive.

3 out of 5 stars b/c they're ok but that's about it."}
{"text":"Overrated. Overpriced. Average burgers. 15 ****ing dollars for a meal. unbelievable. Go to real mccoys or golden star; save yourself the guilt"}
{"text":"I'd been waiting for this Five Guys to open ever since they put the signage up a few weeks ago, and was pumped to see the 'now open' sign when I drove by.  I was able to convince the wife to go later for dinner.

Walked in around 5:30 or so, and there was only one person in front of us in line, and the restaurant (and nice patio) was about 50% full.  We ordered quickly and got situated at our table before I went up to get drinks.  I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of drinks that were available, I counted 14 different fountain drinks (including Cherry Coke, Mello Yello, Orange Fanta and the other usual Coke stand-bys) as well as a Gold Peak dispenser with three different flavors.  I also thought it was nice that all over the restaurant there were boxes of peanuts for patrons to enjoy while waiting for their meals to come out.  My assumption was that it takes awhile to get the food.  Well, I was wrong on that one, because my food was up pretty quickly (less than five minutes).  I'd imagine if it was really busy it'd take take a touch longer, but for this visit, it was good.

I had a cheese burger (which was double pattied), the wife had a cheese veggie sandwich and we split the smallest size of fries.  Now this may have been the smallest size...but we could have probably fed four people off the amount that we got, it was a very generous portion.  Good flavor, but they weren't crisp.  I thought they could have been cooked a little more, the wife thought maybe they had sat out for a bit.  The burger, I liked, meat seemed nice a fresh, with good flavor.  The bun was fresh, but I've had better.  Off one serving, if I had to choose between In N Out or Five Guys forever, I'd probably give In N Out the nod, but this burger is definitely bigger/heartier than what you are going to get at In N Out.  I could see Five Guys growing on me with a few more visits.  

I had previous heard that Five Guys was kind of expensive...I thought it was a pretty good value for our two sandwiches, fries and one soda (wife got water)...less than $15.  (Note:  I did think it odd that there was a tip bucket up front...I mean, there isn't a waiter, I had to go get my own food and I bused my own table...I wouldn't tip at McDonald's...).

Anyways, this is a solid 3.5 for me.  I could definitely see this moving up to a 4 after another visit, but I wasn't blown away this time.  I am excited they are here and a solid burger option for me."}
{"text":"I came in the other night and ordered a little bacon cheeseburger and when I got it there was hardly any meat the fries weren't salted at all and they were cold. There were 9 guys and it still took 15 minutes to get my food it was just annoying"}
{"text":"save ur money guys!!! the burger at five guys burger and fries is not as good as how people are raving about it. the services was crappy. when I went, there where only 3 tables occupied and it took forever for them to give me my order. but the food, it was good. tasty fries!!! the burger is another thing. the meat is overcooked and the bun is dry. to make the matters worst, the cheese is not even melted and it seems like they just put it on the top center of the burger and served it. the high point is that they have free peanuts!!!"}
{"text":"I just.... can't.

About a year ago I swore off Five Guys. They had appeared on the Vegas scene in all their glory and they have since multiplied. I visited 5 Guys in Henderson, and 5 Guys in North Vegas. Each time I just was not completely impressed. The burger, to me, was too loaded with stuff, it was too compacted in the foil, the mustard and ketchup and mayo was all over the place. The fries, although good, were too many, too much, ridiculous. I don't want a bag of fries - I wanted a little cup of fries, why is that so hard to do 5 Guys? I get it. It's their thing, but I guess I just don't like it.

Compare this with Inn N Out, clean, fresh, nicely wrapped burgers. Crispy lettuce, not too many condiments. French fries - perfect, crispy, lightly salted, and served in a nice clean-looking white tray. The fries are not spilling all over your burger in the bag. No. They are just as they should be - contained.

I tried 5 Guys again. I happened to be shopping at Target. I happened to be hungry. It had been awhile so I thought maybe, just maybe I would give 5 Guys another shot. And it all came back to me...

It's just not my cup of tea.

Only cool thing - New-Age Coke Machines. BUT. Firehouse Subs have these popular machines as well. I will go to Firehouse Subs next time, or Inn N Out... anywhere but 5 Guys."}
{"text":"Strike number three for Five Guys. No longer in my rotation. Take a seat on the bench. I'm pretty sure I can't come up with anymore baseball euphemisms... but it doesn't matter because I simply do not like these burgers and fries.

I've wavered about Five Guys and I stayed away for a long time. This afternoon I was in the area and decided, hey I'll try it again. Well I might as well have just gone to Chipotle since my gut was telling me to.

This go round I ordered the Cajun fries, which come with a Cajun seasoning. It does have a kick, but to say these are amazing? No way. I was feeling pretty hungry so I went with the \"Cheeseburger\" (two patties) and I just can't say it's that good. I think it may be the way they wrap the damn thing up so tight. It makes the burger become super soggy super fast. I just feel like I'm eating a mooshed up wanna-be burger. I'm sorry, I feel as though I shouldn't be bashing them this bad, but I'm just so disappointed.

And overall the price just does not reflect these burgers. $11 is too much for a combo meal I don't care how many fries you over-fill my bag with."}
{"text":"Oh at last I made the trek out to 5 Guys to try this place out. I brought my Mom with me as she is a burger connoisseur. Well, not really, she just likes burgers. We arrived at about 11:30 AM and the place was slammed. Lots of police officers (oh and by the way, when we left a fire truck pulled up and firefighters piled out to go inside. Damn, missed 'em!)

So I was really expecting this place to knock my socks off and it didn't really. It reminds me of an Inn N Out, except the staff act like they're all on speed, yelling and there's just a lot of commotion going on behind the counter. I guess it was kind of interesting to watch them work, but the longer I sat there, the more I thought, \"well this must get old quick.\"

Anyway, the service was good even with all the commotion. My mother and I both ordered Cheeseburgers, okay here comes my big complaint: I did not know that ordering a Cheeseburger would mean I get TWO PATTIES. Why doesn't it say that on their menu? I was confused by the \"Cheeseburger\" and \"Little Cheeseburger\" on the menu. I just assumed the little cheeseburger was perhaps a bit smaller than the normal one. But no - my mother and I get surprised with double patties of meat. I like my meat just as much as anyone else, but I really do not like double burgers. Really wish I had known this.

Okay, so minus the fact we were tricked into double burgers - the cheeseburger itself was juicy - plus! I decided to go all out and get mine \"All The Way\", lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, pickles, mayo, ketchup, and mustard. My mom went more conservative - lettuce, tomato, mustard, and pickles. I kinda wish I'd gone more conservative, but that's my own fault. The burger itself WAS GOOD. I will go out and say I liked it better than Smashburger. However, I think it was about on-par with Inn N Out.

As for the fries, I am not a \"natural cut\" french fries fan. My favorite fries come from Inn N Out. So, I guess it's more of a personal preference. I'm not saying they were bad, but they are just not my cup of tea.

I think I would go back here so I could try one of their hot dogs, but I'd skip the fries, AND I would definitely order the LITTLE Cheeseburger. So, with all the hype, this place only gets 3 stars from me. Perhaps I'm just more attuned to a West Coast style burger joint. I do know that 5 Guys originated on the East Coast. It makes me wonder if this location in Las Vegas is lacking what they may bring to the table out on the East Coast? Hmmm, something to ponder."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch w my family and it is the best Five Guys in Las Vegas. Manager was very friendly, accommodating, funny and professional. Staff and service was exceptional. The food was amazing and the burgers were cooked to perfection and mouth watering. We ordered burgers across the board and a large fry for family of five - they gave us enough fries that we all had seconds then some. I highly recommend Five Guys Burger & Fries for lunch or dinner; and if your in Las Vegas Def. go to the one off Lake Mead. It is worth the trip and the service and food will reach anyone's high expectations. Thank you Five Guys... my kiddos love love you & this particular restaurant!!!"}

{"text":"The location of this Five Guys was great, as it was right downtown amidst many other great places. The service was splendid. The food was good; it was better than a normal fast-food burger, but definitely not worth the price I paid for it. The cajun fries are great; you get well beyond the price you pay in fries. I got a \"little fry\" that I was told \"feeds one person\". I could have fed two guys off of those fries (and I can eat a lot of fries). I am so glad that they have the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine! I have used this machine in another restaurant in Tennessee and became fascinated with it. You can pretty much make some crazy drink combinations; I had a Peach Mello Yello. 

Overall, the food was great but not worth the price I paid. Would I go back? Sure, but not often. Would I recommend it to other people? Yes, but with an indication of the prices."}
{"text":"Im giving them two stars because the food was pretty good. However i have never seen service at a quickservice restaurant that was so bad. Slow, there were alot of people waiting quite a while but there was still no urgency. The expeditor was too busy flirting with the girls in front of me to bother worrying about anyone else. The other tables around me seemed pretty irritated. I might go back to 5 Guys, but not this one."}
{"text":"An average burger shack.
Been there when visiting the premium outlet center by McCarran airport with two buddies.

We had 3 cheeseburgers, fries and softdrinks. The burgers have been cuddly. The restaurant was very loud.

I paid for all of us. $46.95 - if you're really really hungry: yes. Otherwise buy some healthy food."}
{"text":"Love you guys, best burgers in town and no extra charge to get the toppings you want...my favorite is mushrooms!"}
{"text":"Man, I guess I just don't get it. I've tried this place twice now, and was unimpressed both times. I really don't understand the excitement over this place.

Just another example of how Eastern transplants to the Phoenix area clamor for anything from \"BACK HOME.\" Plus, this place is way too expensive for an \"Order at the Counter\" burger joint.

Went in last time with a buddy: 2 REG burgers, 1 REG order of fries to split, NO DRINKS - $17.02 WOW! Not to mention (but I will), that it took over 15 minutes to get my order, when this place was nearly empty!!!

The burger was bland and overcooked. The bacon was burnt and crumbled, not even in strips, but looked like somebody just put some charred bac-o-bits on it. High marks for the freshness of the toppings, but so what. After all, it's not called \"5 Guys Toppings,\" is it.

And the fries couldn't be worse if you were actually trying to make them BAD. Just a bland, greasy mess. Yuck.

Maybe, if somebody offers to buy me lunch and insists on 5 Guys, I'll give them another shot. Otherwise; NO WAY!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Ate here on the east coast, so glad they brought it out west! I love how you can customize your toppings for no additional cost, it's a very meaty burger though. Fries are so so but the burger is worth trying."}

Over priced- darn hard to eat anywhere for less then 10 bucks anymore.

Get water and save yourself a few dollars.
Sorry In and out is definitely outclassed by this place."}
{"text":"Was invited to have lunch here with some friends. This time, they turned down the music to a reasonable level, their soda machine had its full complement of flavors and I stayed away from their hot dogs. Their burgers are pretty good, except you have to pay more for them here than at other comparable places."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I love their burgers.  They are absolutely delicious.  But I do have a gripe about the Middleburg Hts. location.   They are stingy with the fries.  We have been to other locations and we can split a large fry and have plenty left over.  Can't do that at this location.  At my latest visit, I ordered three regular fries and they gave me three small fries.  If I wanted my order to be screwed up I would have gone to McDonald's.   I'll give them one more chance but if they screw up the fries, I'll drive past this location and go to another location."}
{"text":"Pretty enjoyable...especially for food court fare.  I enjoyed a little cheese burger all of the way...some well done fries and a drink from their super cool soda machine.  I like that they have vinegar for the fries...nice touch!  The burger was hot and fresh.  Very organized as well and speedy.  I say check it out...a good time and good value!"}
{"text":"First time here and was happy.  Its is very simple you walk in get a hamburger if you tell them what you want one two or three patties tell them what else you want off the menu to put on your burger and that it not very difficult. Burger Fries  I think they do have a a hot dog or something on the menu but you really go there for the burger and fries.  Fries are awesome !  They have stacks of potatoes lined up as  you walk in and stand next to them in line. When they run out someone comes and grabs a bag so they can freshly cut those bad boys and then into the deep fryer they go.  I did try my fries with malt vinegar for the first time ever and the taste just explodes in my mouth. Mouth is watering as I write this..... I do also love how they have the fancy soda machine. This machine rocks because I do get my Cherry Ginger Ale. And that makes me happy.  So when I crave these mouthwatering fries I will know where to go. 5 Guys Burgers and Fries.  Um the prices are a bit high. So I can tell you that I will crave fries more than the burger,"}
{"text":"I had dinner at one of these joints for the first time in my life on 2/16/15 and probably the last time. The fries were soaked in oil and they gave me way more than I could eat even though I only ordered a small. There was so much grease that it soaked through the paper bag. The burger was a double patty bacon burger and exactly the same. Therefore, you can come here and blowout your cholesterol levels. 

The staff was friendly and the place was very clean with a price under $15 for one person. Otherwise, I would have given them a one star."}
{"text":"Whoa...Cheeseburger heaven!! Fresh cut steak fries to die for. Tastes just like a homemade burger. The regular is a double, the works really are the works, soda fountain that offers any soda you desire (coke products), and if that wasnt enough...all you can crack shelled peanuts while you wait for your food!! Its an old fashioned joint for the new generation!!"}
{"text":"Great burger, fries are fresh & thick...get the double if your hungry & 'the works' means EVERYTHING...gets the burger fix handled...and feels like In & Out Burgers midwest cousin...."}
{"text":"Came in again to give them another chance. Still stone cold cheese on my lettuce wrapped burger.

By the time the cheese was warm enough to not feel like was everything was cold. I was famished so I ate it anyways but quite honestly the WORST burger I've ever eaten.

Don't bother coming here if you can't have your burger on a bun."}
{"text":"I've been to this five guys several times, but I don't think I will be going back.  Last Friday I really wanted a hot dog and for some reason I'm in love with their hot dogs.  So I went in ordered my food, the wait was really long and that's nothing new.  But while I was standing there waiting on my food, the employees were being silly I guess just to pass time but they were busy passing out money to each other which I thought was very unprofessional especially when you have a line full of customers.  Any who, while I was waiting watching the teenagers have a ball.  I noticed that there were a pair of sneakers on one of the food racks.  So I took a few pictures of it to prove it before I contacted the company about this nasty matter.  I can honestly say that I've never seen this as any restaurant before.  And when I saw this it made me sick to think that they don't have healthy sanitation practices, you are not supposed to have shoes on a food rack, shoes that have been on floors, dirty floors and you have them on a food rack, a rack where you get your food from to feed your customers.  Just gross, so I thought I would share.
I emailed the store about this today 9/7/12 and was told that having shoes on the rack is something that they allow.  So I don't want to discourage any one from going there if yall are ok with this kind of practice.  I just know that I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"As good as others in chain but they cook burgers in advance to handle the lunch time rush. Congestion by the condiments and straws area. Great location in market square."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly but the burger had very little beef as in Wheres the beef?
The burger looked like a wendys single burger, I was hungry when I left

Prices were very high for the amount of food we got.

The fries that were supposed to be cajun had no cajun flavor.

I liked smashburger much much better and the prices were better"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to give this place a try especially when they opened up on my side of town. When we walked in it was super busy ! I didn't think we were going to find a table. The menu is pretty basic \"no frills\" menu like In -N -Out . The only thing is Five Guy's serves Cajun Fries so we definitely wanted to try that out! 

They have a bin full of peanuts that you can snack on while you wait for your meal. The decor is Red and White just like In -n -Out but this restaurant had more seating. I get my burger pretty fast so I took a bite and thought \"Really ? Is this what all the hype was about ?\" Then I thought maybe it's all about the fries ...it wasn't . The fries were soggy and salty but their large size is enough to feed 3 people! I think I may not have liked the burger because they cook everything here well done. It's great if you don't like bloody meat like my hubby. I gravitate towards meat that is a little more rare so I wasn't thrilled. 

The atmosphere isn't ideal for meeting up with Friends for long periods of time. The workers look for people who are done with their meal and they will clear your table quickly. It makes me feel like I have to go especially when there are so many people looking for a place to sit. The meal is over rated and overpriced. I've had practically the same meal at In- N -Out for like $9.00 where here it was more like $18.00. I'm glad I tried it but it isn't something I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"*cue Barry White music*

You know you want that special feeling dont u.......that special feeling that makes you venture out in pouring rain, but also knowing your body has been deprived for so long of a sensuous burger experience

only one thang can satisfy that void in your heart and your tummy, and it lives on Detroit Rd...........

u dont even take a lot of time to \"dress\" it up with a bunch of gooplyglop because you know it will satisfy you quite well even in its sheer nakedness scantily covered with the perfectly melted cheese

as good as the fries are.....they are the after thought tonight...its just you........and this delicious perfectly cooked meat.....hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

this is what a burger is supposed to do..........turn a typical quick meal out into an experience that sets the standard for carnivore satisfcation"}
{"text":"After trying these guys out in NYC last time I was not sure if they were any good. Well they finally opened up in Henderson near my friends house, I decide to give them another go. I ordered a Cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and grilled onions like I do at In-N-Out. The burger was good like a homemade burger but was missing something like more seasoning on the patties. Overall a good burger but needs work and a closer location to my house."}
{"text":"5 guys is a fun place to go for a \"I need a stack of meat!\" fix. Whoever the 5 guys are, they take pride in an overfilled burger with toppings oozing out the sides! Thank you for the THICK cut tomato and grilled onions....mmmmm. Licked my fingers more than once after polishing off a double patty (I think I will pass on eating dinner now, thanks). The fries are thick cut and full salt (more finger licking). No, I am pretty sure there is not a healthy item on the menue...so this is a treat...but a welcome one. As far as the pricing goes...yep it is a bit pricey...but I can spend $6-7 on a \"value\" meal at a fast food joint...why not get some real meat and toppings for a few bucks more...Share the fries there is more than enough to go around :)"}
{"text":"The prices are decent and the portions are huge.  I'm a pretty big eater, and I still only eat the little burgers and have to split regular size fries on their menu.  A big plus is that none of the toppings on the burgers cost extra.  When you order fries, they give you an extra helping into the bag...makes the bag greasy but they're still delicious.  Your order gets finished pretty fast, even if there's a long line of customers ahead of you.  I always leave happy.  :)"}
{"text":"It's a killer.... LOVE IT!!!! extremely great,nice jucy burger...I would go there over and over and over"}
{"text":"Average burgers and fries.  There are much better to be had in the area, and there are worse.  I have yet to try a milkshake.  Maybe one of these days, but after looking over the ingredient lists online, I may wish to avoid the HFCS.  Free peanuts are decent."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant several times. It's not bad but I wouldn't go outta my way to eat here. Has veggie burger (I know, sounds weird even to me) but I was feeling burgered out. The fries are hugh & a pretty good."}
{"text":"My review would have been 0* but because the ice tea was ok and the ketchup added some flavor to the burger I gave 1*.

Heard about the rave and finally decided to give it a try $8.99 (+tax) for a cheeseburger. ..I definitely expected it to be damn good. Five Guys claims to use 100% fresh beef so I expected the burger to me tasty. To my disappointment,  the meat was dry and tasteless! And for that price, you are better off going to eat in a real restaurant.

Don't recommend it and will not be going back again."}
{"text":"This is your average hamburger joint. Originally based on the east coast and making the expansion in the west. The food is very fresh and never frozen. I love that each day they put where the potatoes came from. It's a nice touch. Service is always friendly and for a quick lunch I like to order online before I get there.

The burgers are good and it's always fun to design it exactly how I want it on that given day. Be warned, the \"little\" burgers are single patty and regular burger is a double. An order of regular sized fries easily feeds two, possibly three people. And the Cajun spice is the way to go there.

The biggest con with the joint is the parking. It's awful on a good day. Be prepared to do some circles or park in the nearby neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love the food and your cashier Verona is awesome! She has a great welcoming spirit about her and that makes the whole experience even better."}
{"text":"Brand spankin' new location close to my house - is this real life?!

We had a great experience here. Due to the place just opening, there was only one other group while we were there, so it cut down on our wait time significantly. Its also very clean, as the peanut shells haven't accumulated all over the floors yet!

Our burgers were delicious, the employees were fun and took great care of us. I'll definitely be back, I love Five Guys!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and looking for a quick bite, I spotted Five Guys and figured, \"why not?\". What I thought would be a quick bite turned into a huge production, waiting over 20 minutes for my meal and making a huge mess in the car. Not too smart! However, the burger was big and delicious, even though it was only a Jr. I was slightly annoyed with the fries, I know it's a big deal how they load your bag up with them, but I literally had to rip the bag open to get to my burger, and the fries ended up being a huge grease pile on the seat of my car (btw anyone know how to get out grease stains?). I ate a few of them, but my interest was more in the burger. I might give it another shot while eating IN, since take out is not the best idea for Five Guys. However, I felt slightly disappointed, and I don't think it lived up to the hype. I did not break into song (\"dayum, dayum, DAYYYUMMM!\") and therefore I feel robbed."}
{"text":"Let me just preface this with \"IN MY OPINION\" since I know people get fiercely zealous about their burger joints, especially Five Guys, for some reason.

So, IN MY OPINION... I thought it was balls.

Maybe it was the build-up, but I found my \"little cheeseburger\" with grilled onions bland and mushy. The bun was so soaked in mayonnaise, I feel it coming out my pores. The meat was BLAND-o-rama, the grilled onions had so much skin left on, I had to keep picking it out and the cheese was both flavorless and so plentiful that it ended up just making the whole experience a mushy, bland, bready mess.

Other low points: the music was way, way, WAY too loud. It was frigid in there because there's an air vent pointed at every table and the fries were limp, but mediocre, at best.

Fatburger is better. So is In-n-Out. So is Smashburger.  Even the new Wendy's burgers are better.  This was my first ever experience with Five Guys, so I don't know about some of the other locations that might be brilliant, but I found it way overrated.  Fairly certain I wont return."}
{"text":"The food was good. I have been to five guys many times. 25.00 for 2 burgers split a fry an 2 sodas seemed a bit high to me.  Frys were fresh, burgers were good, missed some of my ingredients that I ordered.  Serves coke products a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Most people love their hamburgers but I am a fan of their hot dogs!

Their regular burger is pretty tasty and is a double patty. Their small burger is one patty and definitely enough for me.

I love the fact that you can put all kinds of toppings for no extra charge. It really gives you an opportunity to experiment with different toppings every time you go. 

However, the pricing is a little on the expensive side for being hamburgers and hotdogs. Not too expensive....just like 10.00-12.00 for a \"combo\" as they sell things separately.

Overall, once in a while I crave it and do end up coming back."}
{"text":"I come here about once a week.  I love the flat top burgers and the fries are so good.  Plus if you order a small fry it's enough for 2 people they give you plenty.  It's always clean, people are friendly and I enjoy coming to this location. 

Speaking of workers.  There is a lady named Amanda who everytime I come brightens my day.  I was having a bad day at work and was just frustrated when I came in.  She noticed said some kind words to me and ever since then I look forward to seeing her.  She's always super nice and when she knows you and your order she will have it ready for you asap."}
{"text":"This location is consistent with bad service.  Online ordering should mean you get your food when you come in to get your order, not 15 minutes after you arrive and pay for it. Why even have online ordering when its not convenient? I have also waited 15 minutes for a small order of fries. Nobody could break away to give me fries. I got them even after the family behind me got all of their food. And, for the cool guy who takes phone orders, \"peace\"? Try a touch of professionalism on the phone. Maybe I'm hoping more restaurants can have great service like Chipotle and Chik-fil-a. I'm sure their pay is comparable."}
{"text":"It's a good burger but not great.  There are much better spots for a burger in Vegas.  Try Smashburger, KGB Burger, In-N-Out.  I could have been swayed to give a fourth star but the price is so high, a littler under $5 for a single burger, that it's not justified.  I'd go back if friends were going but Five Guys wouldn't be my choice."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  EVERYTHING I hear is that death cannot happen before downing a burger from this place.  OK, it's not bad but I felt like I needed a good artery cleaning afterwards.  I could've squeezed enough grease outta this meal to lube the chassis of my truck.  Gimme an animal style at In N Out any day."}
{"text":"Very greay option for a good, quick bite.

The menu is simple but everything tastes good and made fresh to order. 

Pricing is on the higher end of a burger joint but it's still worth it.

You wont get swayed away by the basic decor but you won't be there long enough to bother. 

On my last visit the men washrooms could have bee  cleaner, the paper towel dispenser was broken."}
{"text":"I don't get it? Everyone brags about their fries, I thought they were under cooked and soggy. Disgusting if I were asked. Also $8 for a burger, $3/for disgusting fries and $2 for a fountain drink. You got to be kidding. $28 for two people???? First and last time! There's so many places that cost a fraction of this shithole with so much better tasting food."}
{"text":"Even when online ordering check your burger before you leave. Drove home with the wrong burger had to go back out to pick up what I ordered then return home to cold fries"}
{"text":"How enchanting.
A brown bag of french fries that before I can whisk them off to my table, has already saturated the bag with grease.
And a double cheeseburger that after only two bites has fallen apart.

I do like the soda dispenser, very unique, almost futuristic in a sense.

In the end, If I want to spend twenty five bucks for lunch for two of us, I'll go someplace where I'm not ingesting a half bucket of grease in the process. 

Note:  
Don't go here before going to the movies. Your  body's grease-o-meter will be hitting red line, making you think twice about that bag of buttered popcorn.

Or who knows, maybe you like grease.
Not me."}
{"text":"Daughter, Kathy, and I were in need of Lunch; and we wanted to stay in this area... Five Guys was the choice, since Kathy knew I had been taste-testing one-pound Burgers in Northern California... where I live.

It was last Tuesday, a half hour before Noon, and there was no line at all at that time... Lucky, I guess.

If you're into Burgers, the menu is divided between the Single-Pattie Burgers preceded by \"Little\" in the name... And the double-Pattie kind... about a buck fifty difference in general. Toppings are free... Mayo, Lettuce, Pickles, Tomatoes, Grilled Onions, Grilled Mushrooms, Ketchup, Mustard, Relish, Onions, Jalapeno Peppers, A1 Steak Sauce, BBQ Sauce, and Hot Sauce.... whew! If you say \"Everything\" (or some synonym), you'll receive Mayo to Mustard piled on.

Question to clerk... \"What is your favorite Burger?\" Answer... \"I don't eat Burgers. I'm a Vegetarian.\" Five Guys must be paying this clerk well... to have a Vegetarian work at a despicable Hamburger Stand.

Well... decided on the...

Cheeseburger (** 1/2 $5.79) Toppings consisted of Extra Mayo, Onions, Lettuce, Tomato & Mustard.

Everyone Brown-Bags it at Five Guys... everyone... including dine-in customers. My first impression after unwrapping the Cheeseburger was the thought that this tastes like something familiar... couldn't come to a definite conclusion. But the general impression... nothing that would knock your socks off... in essence, Just a Burger! And an expensive one at that... especially with the Fries as an additional purchase! (See similar double-pattie from Burger King called a Buck Double...)

Regular Cajun Style Fries (** $2.89) if it weren't for the fact that the Fries came out cool and over-cooked.. this would be a pretty good pile of Fries... especially with the sprinkled Cajun Spice Powder. 

As you all know... once the Fries get cool... they also get clumpy.... and you have to eat them faster, faster and faster before they get COLD!

Question to audience... Does Five Guys deliberately throw the Fries into the Brown Bag? Seems like it...

Regular Fountain Drink $1.99 x 2

Kathy' order...
Bacon Cheese Dog (*** $4.99) No further comment by Kathy...


With all these raving positive comments plastered all over the wall, I expected more... a lot more. 

At the end of the meal... I figured out what a Five Guys Burger tastes like... a McDonald's Big Mac! How disappointing!"}
{"text":"Love love love their hot dogs!! You gotta try it, yes its a bit more expensive than most people would usually spend on a hot dog, but I think its worth it!"}
{"text":"8 people working here right now at 4:30 on a Friday, and one really nice tall black dude took my order and made my burger while everyone else was chatting. Give him a promotion and train everyone else again.

AMAZING burger by the way, but figure out what the staff is doing."}
{"text":"Came here as a recommendation from Mike A and yes it was as great as he said it would be.  The burgers here are great, I love the casual atmosphere and set up where you pick everything you want on the burger.  They have those new cool soda fountain machines and the burger was great, I just got the cheeseburger just the way I like it and the jalapenos still had the seeds so it had a great spicy kick.  I will most definitely go back for more.  The whole meal with fries and a drink was about $9 which is good for a quality meal."}
{"text":"Came here the other day and I was eating my 5 guys burger and I had a feeling I was Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction eating that big kahuna burger.  \"very tasty\"  I say to myself (because I am not really eating with anyone or pointing a gun ready to read scripture right before I blow someone's flipping brains out).  Anyway, this location is pretty nice and they are always clean and very uniform to the same look.  This one is larger than the location on Bell and 7st I have been to.  They cook the burger right when you get there and you can see them put the raw burger on the grill.  Something about these burgers just sing to me.  They have great fresh ingredients and the burger is just so very juicy.  What can I say, I am a fan."}
{"text":"My first time here I didn't think it was as good as all the hype people told me about it, but the bext few times I realized their burger is Amazing and the fries are the best thing.  Be sure to order the regular fries, you get a large portion."}
{"text":"This chain does fast food burgers well. Love that the fries are fresh cut."}
{"text":"This will fix a  burger craving.  Big plus,  fries are fresh cut."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot about Five Guys' burgers, but they have not yet reached Bakersfield, CA where I live so this was my first experience with them.

A sign next to cash register tells you where today's potatoes are from (Rexbury, ID  Brown's Farm).  That is just too cool.  They actually keep track of the potatoes?  It gives me the impression they take great care with everything else, too!

There are free peanuts in the shell; help yourself to as much as you like!

They have the good kind of soda machines where you can choose a variety of flavors or  mix and match.  My favorites are the Sprite Zero in raspberry, vanilla, peach, strawberry, and grape!  See, I TOLD you there were a lot a choices!

There is a predominance of red and white in their decor, especially in the checkered patterns. The black ceiling with scarlet duct work  looked great!  There was very loud music playing catchy tunes. (Pretty Woman was one of them)  The smell wafting through the restaurant is amazing 


A regular hamburger comes with two patties, and a small comes with a single patty.  The hamburger was thick and juicy and tasty!  TheCcajun fries were the best seasoned fries I've ever tasted!  I'm going to be dreaming/fantasizing about them for a long time!

There is quite a variety of customers in the restaurant.  On the day we were here, there was a  national guard unit wearing camouflage uniforms, there were young twenty something's tatted up, older couples with gray hair looking like they were heading off to the country club, and me and my coworker who were in town for the weekend doing a live broadcast of a national dance competition (just call me twinkle toes).   Apparently EVERYBODY knows that this place has the best hamburgers in town.

So, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Jenny R and I popped in here this afternoon. I've walked by a few times and noticed the long lines and crowds inside. I had to see what the fuss was about.
I'm very impressed. This is my new favorite burger spot. They have normal size burgers (i.e. huge) as well as mini versions. I got a mini because I'm watching my figure and it was the perfect size burger for me. The burger comes naked as a Jaybird. If you want something on it (and they have quite a list of toppings) you have to specify. The burger was one of the best I've ever had in my life. Perhaps it was the grilled onions and mushrooms. 
The cajun fries were smothered in spice and made my tongue sweat. I liked it! (\"Small\" must mean \"enormous.\" Get a small and you can easily split it was a friend or two.)
Five Guys wasn't any more pricey than any other burger spot around town. The mini burger and small cajun fries came to $6.50 ish. (No drink for me. I only drink water, and that's always free.)
I'm only going here for burgers from now on. I'm very pleased to see this on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Been here twice but still don't know why people were raving about this place. Burgers here taste like any other burgers. Maybe there's a special sauce there that I don't know about? Overall, can't differentiate this burger from Burger King. Waste of money."}
{"text":"These burgers are absolutely amazing!  So many toppings to choose from (and no extra charge for them!!).  The fries (the small ones) are big enough to feed a small family of 12."}
{"text":"Five Guys makes a great burger.  It has been a while since I've been to one and I was craving one so I decided to stop in.  Keep in mind when ordering that the regular burgers are doubles.  If you want a single patty then order the little burgers.  They offer a plethora of condiments and toppings.  The twice fried fries are some of the best that I've ever had.  Get them regular or Cajun seasoned. The bonus scoop of fries that they throw in the bag ensures you won't leave here hungry.  

I ordered the little bacon burger which was just the right size for me.  I had it made with lettuce, tomato, mustard, ketchup and jalapenos. That perfectly cooked patty with crispy bacon and soft bun was so good.  No thin flimsy burgers at Five Guys.  Food is cooked to order so your food is nice and hot.  Be sure to bring an appetite.  Free peanuts by the way."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. The floors are sticky, tables are sticky and wobbly. I have a hard time eating at such a dirty environment. The burgers have gotten really greasy time to move on to another 5 guys"}
{"text":"Pricey but delicious! I really enjoy eating when I am on a low carb diet. The burgers have very little filler that would had hidden carbs to all those carbohydrate counters out there, they offer their burgers and hotdogs to go bunless also. Yes! Even their hotdogs!"}
{"text":"I was excited about Five Guys Burgers since it was available only in the States for the longest time. I decided to come here for a snack after work one day.

Aside from the great selections of free toppings for the burger, I have to say Five Guys was mediocre. I got a cheeseburger with mayo, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions and grilled mushrooms. It was delicious and worth a try but it's not a place I'll keep coming back to.

I do love the concept of free peanuts that you can help yourself to as they are preparing your burger so people with peanut allergy beware!

It's definitely more expensive than McDonald's and not as creative as Big Smoke Burger (formerly known as Craft Burger) so if you're a burger addict, go ahead try it but if you just want to try just for the sake of trying it ... save your money."}
{"text":"I ordered a little cheeseburger with a good amount of toppings. I also ordered a little fry and regular sized Dr. Pepper. The food was good. The place was clean. A bit more expensive compared to competitors, but a good experience overall."}
{"text":"Great burger and fries, order was quick...maybe a bit too quick, missed the bacon on my burger. But it was good anyway."}
{"text":"Everyone always says how amazing this place is across the country, so of course we had to try it out. The first one I went to was near Chicago, and it was okay. Then again, I don't really eat burgers (or fast food) all too often!

The Surprise location that just opened up, however, is not even comparable to the Chicago location we tried. My aunt really wanted to try it out, so we met her there during her lunch break and ordered some burgers and stuff. I don't remember it being that confusing to order before, but we were completely lost with all of the options/process and the people taking our orders were not very helpful. It was also extremely busy, but that was expected. However, some of the employees were extremely rude to other customers around us. They weren't rude to me personally, but I didn't like the way I saw a few of them speak to other customers. I thought I'd speak up for them, whether they realized it was happening or not! :P Some people are pretty oblivious, but employees shouldn't take advantage of that lol.

In my opinion, our orders were extremely simple. A few burgers and fries, nothing special about any of it. However, they took forever to get them out to us. The soda machines were pretty neat, but it was hectic trying to find the correct beverage with how busy the place was and the location of said soda machines. It was right in the way of the queue of people waiting for their orders, so it was also hard to tell who was waiting for what. It was also hard to hear which order numbers were being called, so I just stood right next to them waiting. I probably annoyed them, but oh well! Even then, I still could barely tell what order numbers they were calling out. I think they had a microphone to use, but they didn't seem to want to do that for some reason. (This is also one of the times I heard them being rude to other customers... this guy calling the numbers out called one customer's order two or three times, and the poor girls couldn't hear him. He finally got their attention and bitched at them for taking so long to get their order from him. I thought he was kidding with them at first, but the look on his face said otherwise.)

Overall, we weren't at all impressed with the price, the food (which was simply mediocre, nothing special), and service. Luckily I don't care about burgers because I'm not very American, but still... a disappointment for sure."}
{"text":"Fries are the bomb !! Didn't eat a hamburger today I didn't want to fell like a fatass ! Lol"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of people raving about this place so I had to try it."}
{"text":"So I only had a milkshake, but burgers just aren't my thing. It was a damn good milkshake ok?? They need to provide bigger straws considering how thick it was. I love all the flavor options. I got salted caramel and peanut butter. My dad got chocolate and malted milk. It had no malt flavor actually, so that sucked."}
{"text":"While I am still a fan of the food, I cannot ignore the sub-par customer service.  When I arrived at the order counter and say hello the dead pan stare of the gentleman behind the counter replies with a short\" what do you want?\".  He continued his lack of enthusiasm throughout the process.  The place was not clean, and definitely not overwhelmingly busy.  I think this was the last time I come to this location...they have gone way down hill since opening."}
{"text":"Wow. I just cried. Best bunless burger ever. All toppings are free. Quality meat. Cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"My first visit ever to 5 Guys Burgers was a positive one. The burger was seasoned very well. The variety of toppings seemed endless. (I was a little bummed I could not get a fried egg added to my burger, but that are the things fantasies are made of). The gal at the counter was very friendly and patient with me. The music mix in the lobby was top notch, although the 65¬∞ lobby made me yearn for the Aloe Vera lotion at home to soothe my sunburnt skin. I will be back."}
{"text":"Peanuts! Getcha free peanuts here!!!!  Oh Five Guys how I love thee :) being able to have as many mushrooms on my burger as I want makes me giggle. So here's the low down you can have a single(little) or double cheese or hamburger each meat patty is 1/3lb. There's a huge list of toppings to choose from, my gotos being extra extra shrooms, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, and mayo. Normal! You can also get steak sauce, BBQ sauce, relish, jalape√±os, and many others! Now the fries!! They're made fresh and you can have regular or Cajun seasoning. I get regular with a side of Cajun and mix it into my ketchup for dipping yuuuum! They have one of those nifty new touch screen coke machines so it takes forever to choose what you're gonna drink, ever tried peach dr.pepper? Me neither, gross.  Their customer service is always spot on and they're always cleaning something! 

The only reason I deducted a star was due to the fact they have zero sweets for dessert! Not even shakes which usually go hand in hand with burgers!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Five Guys Burgers. A few of my friends were underwhelmed by the burgers/prices/whatever, but I'm definitely a fan. It seems that people constantly draw comparisons to In-N-Out (and I get why), but the burgers are a lot bigger here and there are so many toppings to choose from; it just isn't the same thing.

Pros: 
Gigantic Burgers! I got a bacon cheeseburger (with 2 patties, which is the default size) with jalapenos, onions, lettuce, tomato, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember. This thing was about 5 inches tall and weighed like 20lbs*. 

Fresh Jalapenos!! This is a big one for me. It's very, very rare that any place uses fresh jalapenos as a topping. It's always the slices that come in a jar soaking in vinegar and are dark green and not spicy. Those are good on nachos. You know what's better on nachos? Fresh jalapenos! They're better on everything, and Five Guys recognizes this. Well done, chaps! 

Peanuts while you wait! I don't really care for peanut, but the option is nice. You just grab a paper tray and fill it with some peanuts while you wait for your monster burger to be cooked.

Flavor! As with the jalapenos, the other toppings are all fresh and delicious. The bun has a nice flavor to it, and the beef tastes great. I like my burgers medium-rare, but these patties have a nice charred exterior and taste great. 

Bacon!! I feel like I don't have to comment on this one. It's bacon.

Cons:
The bun. While it tastes great, it isn't really substantial enough for mammoth-sized burger duties. It's really soft, which unfortunately leads to the bottom bun getting overwhelmed with burger juices. About halfway through my burger I had messy hands and was essentially just holding on to the patty on the bottom. The top doesn't get as bad, but it still doesn't hold up. Toasting the bun would likely help, or even putting the lettuce on the bottom would prevent the bottom from getting soaked. 

The fries. I don't usually like fries, but I felt like I had to try these. A lot of people talk about how good the fries are, and it's in the name, so, why not? I didn't care for them at all. They do give you a lot, though, so if you like fries, you might like these. 

Five Guys is quickly becoming my favorite burger chain. With it's gigantic, flavorful burgers and it's fairly reasonable prices (I think the bacon double cheeseburger is like 6 bucks. Not bad for almost a day's worth of food), you can't really go wrong. 


*That's definitely an exaggeration, but it was hefty!"}
{"text":"I really love Five Guys!  The workers are always friendly but there were over the top at this one! WOW. Everyone was super friendly, chatting and smiling the entire time (there was a worker who sounded a tad like Gomer Pyle to me, kinda made me giggle)

I am not in any way knocking Five Guys - I would never. I heart them. This was probably my least favorite burger. I did try the burger (w/ double meat) instead of the little burger (one meat patty) this time which I never have so maybe it was just too much for me. I could barely taste the mayo, I had to add more ketchup because it just seemed just  a little dry. Still love this restaurant overall though!!"}
{"text":"Five Guys. Five Stars. Always great customer service, amazing food, and great prices."}
{"text":"Does no one know how to season a burger? Look people Im stingy on my calories and if I'm starving myself all day with yogurt to indulge in a burger.. It better be worth it. For some reason this particular five guys has NO flavor to their burgers and their Cajun fries are completely lacking.

The staff is super nice though and can make a damn good looking burger. I just wish it tasted as good as it looks. Maybe it was a fluke.. Well try again on another night. Maybe someone will throw some salt or pepper on the meat and change these stars up a bit.."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the burgers at 5 Guys! It's definitely not the cheapest burger joint in town, but you get what you pay for. Fries here are great as well..."}
{"text":"I resisted this place for a ling time thinking the hype was just an excuse to charge more for a fast food burger and fries.  Out of necessity, I tried it today.  Boy was I wrong!  The food was amazing.  It was piping hot, and more fries than even I could eat.  The service was faster than most \"fast food\" places.  What really struck me was the attitude of the workers.  Instead of getting the feeling that I was an annoyance, they all seemed like they couldn't wait for me to try their food.  I could not have been more satisfied."}
{"text":"Very good burgers with lots of great choices of toppings such as green chile or fried mushrooms! Friendly and competent Staff."}
{"text":"Burgers are going downhill. Did they change the meat?  Messed up half the order.  Slow."}
{"text":"Stopped by this Five Guys as the Sensotei Ramen next door was packed!

I ordered a burger, large fries and a fountain drink; got the burger fully loaded (though it makes quite a mess) but it was incredibly delicious.. came up to about $18.

The fries is a huge portion.. they fill up a cup and then add an extra scoop of fries into the bag. The drinks are refillable as it is self-serve.

As with all Five Guys locations, they offer peanuts to munch on while you wait for your meal to be prepared.

There is plenty of seating in this clean, well-lit location."}
{"text":"Forget In-N-Out, I want 5 Guys! 

I'm not a fan of fast food- I maybe eat it once a month. But I was downtown, hungry and had heard good things so I stopped in. I got a little hamburger (their regular ones have 2 patties like a Double Double at In N Out) with the works, minus mayo (I hate mayo), plus jalapenos. What I got was one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had in my life. It tasted fresh, the ingredients were plentiful and it was just plain delicious. I also shared some cajun fries with a friend. They were spicy and amazing! It made me suck down my Diet Coke quickly because they were actually spicy, but I loved it. 

Their employees were friendly, and when their fire alarm went off, they acted like it happened all the time rather than an emergency. My only complaint is that the alarm lasted a little too long and they didn't say anything about it. 

I compare them to In-N-Out because they are a burger joint with similar set up, color scheme and offerings. However, they have a larger menu, are slightly more expensive (but WORTH it) and don't take as long to make your food. 

I loved it. Will happily go back and make this the place where I go get my fast food fix once a month."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about. Greasy mess. Tasty yes but greasy."}
{"text":"The burgers here are great, don't get my wrong, but there is something about the relentless self-promotion (in the form of their wall art) that drives me crazy. It is so desperate. And I say that because they don't need to do it. I don't need to read \"Delaware Today\"s opinion on how amazing this place is. I am here. I would like to decide for myself. 

Otherwise though, the employees are great. Food is delicious. And if you don't mind some shameless self-love, you just might be the next person to write their review!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't get it. How this place has any reviews higher than four-stars is beyond me. And I don't mean that in an overtly critical way, nor do I mean to say this place is anything like a two-star... no. It's a solid three. Let me tell you why. 

I walked in today after getting my eyes looked at the awesome eye doc above this place. I asked the girl working the counter for a cheeseburger with everything, plus fries and a drink. At most places, this would constitute some sort of combo meal. Here they seemed to charge me for everything piece meal. All together it was right north of $12, which seemed kinda steep. Thinking it might be totally worth it like Smashburger, I was cool with it. 

While waiting for my burger and fries, I went up to their cool-looking future soda tron. It's essentially a soda machine with a touch screen that allows you to pick from a bunch of different types of soda. So far, so good. A few minutes later, someone walked by and asked me if they could get me ketchup or something while I waited for my food. I said yes, thank you, that'd be swell. Plus points for that. Then a few moments later my food was ready. I ate a few of my \"spicy\" fries for a minute and headed home. Twenty minutes later, I was home and ready to tear into my burger. O opened it up, and... how to put this nicely... my expectations were not met. I found a smallish burger topped with all the usual fixings. $12 worth of food? Nope. 

I tore into it and was even further depressed. The burger was ok, on par with the burgers my dad sometimes makes at home. Good meat and seasoning, sure, and probably well worth $5, but not 12. It wasn't even a big enough burger where you can say at least you got your money back in volume. 

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Man, I love a burger. Nothing makes me as happy as a delicious, cheesy burger, perfect fries, and an ice cold drink. It's seriously the best way to raise my spirits. 

The burgers here are pretty good. They're cooked well, the toppings are good, and they're pretty big. The regular order of fries is way too big for me, so I try to stay away from it. The cool soda machine that allows for a million drink combinations is pretty cool, though I always end up with Sprite and peach flavor. IDK. In short, I like the food here. 

So why three stars? This place is expensive for what it is. It's a little burger joint, NBD, located close to an In N Out and Smashburger. Both places serve amazing burgers for better prices. I went to Five Guys a few days ago and spent $24 on two burgers and two fries. Seriously. I coulda gone to Applebee's and done their 2-for-$20 deal I love so much. The prices here are too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Went here recently and was very impressed... especially for a \"fast food, chain\" burger
You get to pick your toppings and they have practically everything (nothing fancy but all the classics)
I had the regular burger and cajun fries
the burger was juicy and was a nice thickness-to-bus ratio
the fries were also very tasty and its a big portion (i got the large but shared with 2 others)
refillable drinks which is also a plus cause a lot of other places try to be cheap on the drinks
all in all a great burger for a really good price
way better than other fast food chains *mcdonalds cough, cough*"}
{"text":"If you like NUTS go here. If you like hamburgers go to another restaurant but here.

We spent for two people $22.00 and we got food that looked like someone had it in the back of a truck all day. It was ok of a taste. Extremely thin slices of meat. It took forever to get our food. It was noisy and nuts everywhere. I don't get the nuts. Sell nuts but not hamburgers!"}
{"text":"Great burger joint.  Whenever we are in Strongsville it's a must eat.

Love the seasoned fries and the burgers are downright tasty."}
{"text":"Did you read the news? Five Guys recently passed In and Out as America's favorite burger. It is easy to see why - the burgers and fries are made fresh to order. The store has a nostalgic theme with the white and red colors reminiscent of a 50s diner. 

This location is probably my favorite burger in the Steele Creek area, especially when I am famished. If you arrive hungry there are boxes and boxes of peanuts stacked up for snacking. I love sitting and watching my hamburger cook. Five Guys also has the same philosophy I do when it comes to hamburgers - double patties are the norm! With the open environment you can see your food as they make it so you know for sure just how fresh everything is! 
The fries portion borders on ridiculous. When I order to go I get the regular fries portion and it is about a third of the bag. It's okay though because I split them with my dog, it mitigates my guilt for not sharing the hamburger with him. 

The only hesitation I have with going here is the price. Last time a cheeseburger and fries (no drink!) set me back $12 which is a bit much for a chain fast casual restaurant. However the quality is spot on and the online ordering makes it a delicious and fast meal."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I hit this place up during the Horror & Sci-Fi Film festival this weekend.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and she picked up a regular cheese burger with onions and mushrooms.  ..also grabbed a small fry.

I gotta say the taste of these burgers are absolutely delicious.  Just juicy as can be.  The fries are great too, but I recommend getting the small.. plenty of food.

I loved that all the condiments are free to put on the burger.  My only gripe is that they dont tell you how big the burgers are.  After getting our food, we both realized that we could have split one big burger or each have gotten a jr burger.  

Loved the taste of this place and would most definitely go back here and chow down."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is sooo overrated and overly priced! I don't understand all the hype, brag and why people recommend this place?? I swear, In-N-Out Tops This Place across the charts. They don't even carry 1000 island dressing to put on ur burger? Wow!!
They left that part out given all the choices they offer. I definitely won't recommend this place to anyone because they claim \"fresh\" tasting food and it is not, and it's overly priced."}
{"text":"Burgers at this place are always fresh and filling. You don't get the truly obscene amount of fries that you used to get, but there are way more than enough to round out your meal. 

When you eat in, the drink refills are free, so you might as well have a seat and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit here, and I couldn't find anything wrong with it...hence the 5 stars.  We decided to head downtown on a Sunday afternoon to try out their burgers.  Good idea, since the parking garage was empty (plus free).  We were greeted warmly when we walked in, and explained about their ordering system.  I decided on a little cheeseburger with grilled onions and light on the ketchup/mustard.  My husband went with the regular cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and ketchup.  We ordered one regular fry for the 2 of us (we were told it would be A LOT), plus 2 drinks.  The restaurant was practically empty, only a few other patrons already in there, and it was nice and cold (which I love!).  The music was blaring, and had a fun vibe to it.

When our food was ready, it was steaming hot and delicious!  He wasn't kidding when he said there'd be a lot of fries!  They prepped my cheeseburger perfectly, the ketchup and mustard added lightly.  I love when a restaurant listens to how I order something...thank you for that!  We both really enjoyed the food, and everything was cooked to perfection.  

I read some other reviews, and a number of people complained about soggy fries.  We didn't have those at all.  I like crispy fries, so I pulled out those first, but I'll admit, there wasn't a bad fry in the batch.  We both enjoyed them immensely, and finished them off...not too salty and not soggy at all.

We'll definitely be making another trip downtown on a weekend when we want burgers & fries.  Five Guys deserves five stars!!"}
{"text":"great burger- one of the best i have had, but a little pricey for a fast foodish kind of place.. love the cool soda machine too !"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love Five Guys... just not this location (W. Sunset Road, Henderson, NV). Five Guys burgers and fries are absolutely delicious, with a large selection of toppings for the burgers.

My problem with this location, and the reason for the one star review, is that they don't pay attention to the order. Two out of the last three times I've patronized this location, my burger was made incorrectly. 

I always order a bacon cheeseburger at Five Guys. The receipt states bacon, plus the shorthand LBC (little bacon cheeseburger) or BCB (bacon cheeseburger). Yet two out of the last three times I've patronized this location, they forgot the bacon. I wouldn't mind so much if they forgot the mushrooms or put onions on instead of mushrooms (that happened once at a different location), but bacon costs extra (all of the other toppings are included in the cost of the burger). 

The first time it happened (in early December 2015), I ordered through the Five Guys app and carried it out. Obviously, I didn't know they forgot the bacon until I arrived at my destination and sat down to eat. Strike one. I filled out the survey on the receipt, letting them know they forgot to put bacon on my burger. A couple of hours later I was contacted by a Five Guys representative, who apologized for the mistake and offered me a free meal on my next visit. All I needed to do was go to the restaurant and mention this conversation, which was supposed to be forwarded to the store. 

A couple of weeks later, I went back for lunch, but no one knew anything about the free meal that was offered to me. No free meal. Strike two. I bought a bacon cheeseburger and fries anyway... they made it correctly this time.

Last Sunday (24 January 2016), after bowling, some friends went with me and my wife to this Five Guys location for a late lunch/early dinner. Like usual, I ordered a little bacon cheeseburger and, lo and behold, there was no bacon on my burger again. STRIKE THREE! YER OUT! Sorry, fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on you. I got my bacon since we ate at the restaurant, but that is the last time I will patronize this Five Guys location. I'll still patronize other Five Guys restaurants, but not the one on W. Sunset in Henderson NV."}
{"text":"Satisfying, delicious, and never disappoints. It's worth the money, best fast burgers around."}
{"text":"I LOVE Five Guys! 

Lol, but every time I want to go, my fiance takes the name 'Five Guys' wrong. It's pretty funny.

Yes, the burgers are very pricey but they are GOOD! However. I would only get their \"Little\" burger and not a regular size. The little burgers are probably the size of a Quarter Pounder from McDonald's and maybe even bigger. But when I did have the regular size, you will be in the bathroom for awhile. I'm not trying to make it sound gross, but it's true. Their food is extremely greasy.

And no matter what you order, get the fries. If you have 3 people, all you need is one order. They grab a brown bag, and throw all of these fries in there. They are so crispy (which are the only kind of fries that I like), salty, and crunchy! I just wouldn't eat here too often because their stuff is really fattening and they give you a huge heaping amount of fries. But overall, their stuff is amazing and we will be going back for a long time!"}
{"text":"Well, it was a decent burger but its no In N Out and its a little on the pricey side compared to most other burger places. To me, its kind of like a good summer BBQ burger that you can customize pretty much any way you want. As mentioned in another review, there are bonus points for having Cherry Coke even though it was \"out of order\" when I was there... the peanuts are fun, but an odd combo with a burger and fries. I would have liked to see a milk shake on the menu as it would have been a better fit. 

All things considered I would go back and try it again. I think its one of those places where once you figure out how you want YOUR burger it can become habit forming... I just don't see it as something that stands out from the crowd."}
{"text":"Im going to say four because I am a fan but don't get an attitude when someone asks for ranch sorry I didn't know that \"YOU DONT DO RANCH\" But the burgers were good fries kinda soggy ...I mean really soggy ...eh things happen! at least the burger made up for it!"}
{"text":"I remember 10 years ago thinking that the Five Guys in Tempe was awesome. I think they had some cache back then for being the only location in Phoenix. The place was always packed with a line out the door. Now they are everywhere. But each location is still always busy. And I just don't get it. Thin greasy patties with no taste whatsoever.  Yes, you can get a bunch of toppings for free but I would rather pay the extra 50¬¢ or whatever for grilled onions and bbq sauce and get more than five little specs of onion and a teaspoon of sauce. I will say the cajun fries were highly addictive but I did not appreciate having to eat them out of the bottom of the paper bag they were thrown into, even though it wasn't a to-go order. And warning if you get jalepenos on your burger: this is the only topping that they are generous with. Which I would have appreciated if they weren't completely raw.  Not sauteed or grilled, not even pickled in vinegar. Just sliced up raw, complete with the seeds, white membrane, and stem."}
{"text":"We recently visited this location, our first time at a Five Guys restaurant. I would give it 5 stars, if it were not for the prices.  Just a tad more than I'd like to pay for a simple burger & fries. However, we will definitely be going back.  The employees were friendly, and when the cook called out our order number, he then waited for me to take the bag from him and said, \"Thank you, we appreciate you guys\".  This was very sincere and unexpected. We liked munching on peanuts while waiting for our burgers to be grilled fresh!"}
{"text":"Hands down love this place. It's a very simple menu, but I've never had a better burger anywhere else and the price is definitely reasonable.

Try the grilled cheese - YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Their burgers get a so-so from me.  The way that you order them is kind of fun though, reminds me of an In-and-Out.  Fries are delicious too.  We dared a friend of mine to try the bacon wrapped hot dog, joking because no one is stupid enough to try such a disgusting combination.  He did get it though, ate about two bites of it, and pouted for the rest of the meal, blaming it on us for suggesting it."}
{"text":"I almost never eat hamburgers, but I went to 5 guys because I've only heard good things. I've been back 3 times in 2 months. That's more burgers than I've had in the last 5 years. Also, the fries are the best I've had in a fast casual restaurant. YUM!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries!  The burgers are made of fresh beef, they are thick and juicy.  The fries are fresh cut and delicious.  When we're in the mood for a good burger, this is where we come."}
{"text":"Burgerfi is shit. Five guys does it right. Come eat a real burger here!!!!!!!! Even a little burger and small fry would fill up a hungry man!! Bravo"}
{"text":"After hearing about Five Guys, I was glad to finally try it.  The burgers are great!!!!  I had lots of extra toppings on my burger, and it was done just right and did taste like mom's and dad's cooking.  You can't beat munching on the peanuts while waiting for the burger -- great idea!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but nothing too write home about. Prices are too high for burger, fries & drink."}
{"text":"Bought 5 guys last night for first time. 2 cheese burgers and large fries. $22.. f--ng expensive. No flavor on the meat, really bland taste, bacon is paper thin, i dont know how these guys in bysiness. Ripping the public off. Wendys has much bettet taste and s lot less expensive. Will never eat here againg!!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time at a Five Guys last Saturday for National Hamburger Day. I came here on a friends recommendation after seeing that BRGR's line was out the door.

I had the cheeseburger with sauteed mushrooms and sauteed onions. They went really light on the topping only under the bottom of the two toppings to the point I could barely taste them. I find it only marginally better than a McDonald's quarter pounder with cheese, as another reviewer commented. That much said In-n-Out doesn't do much for me either, so I can see how some might disagree.

I much prefer burgers where they grind their own beef and you can get something besides super well-done... I used to really like Fuddruckers before they went out of business."}
{"text":"I went to this Five Guys Burgers with my mom recently. Both my mom and I have never had Five Guys Burgers before, but we heard it was good so we were happy to try it. The burgers and fries were appetizing. I would have given a higher rating, but the soda and condiment station was kind of a mess and the customer service was lacking a little. I ordered a cheeseburger and the cashier asked \"what do you want on your cheeseburger?\" I responded with \"Uh, lettuce? tomatoes? Onions?\" In my head I was like, \"You know, the normal stuff you put on a cheeseburger.\" My mom responded in the same confused manner when asked what she wanted. It was obvious we weren't understanding the purpose of her question, but the cashier just looked at us awkwardly, smiled and asked if that was it for us. She looked like a young college student and maybe with a little more years of experience she would have been able to easily identify that we've never been to a Five Guys before (or were otherwise incompetent at ordering beef and spuds) and explained the way it worked a little bit. After we already ordered, I saw a sheet of paper on the counter with a checklist of things you want to include on your burger. Had I known that, I would have ordered something completely different. But the food and the service was all around enjoyable and I'll be going back, if not to this location to another location."}
{"text":"I heard so much good things about Five Guys. I learned my lesson and tried for the first time when we were starving didn't eat breakfast and it was 1pm on a Saturday. Line was long, but quick. Quick service. Burger was a double and delicious. I tried the bacon burger with the works with everything minus mayo. Next time I'm trying a bacon cheeseburger with everything including bbq sauce and jalopenos. I love how you can mix and match toppings on your burgers! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I like Five Guys better than In-n-Out. Yes, I live in California and here we have only 3 Five Guys (very far away) among the ten of thousands of In-n-Out.

The burgers are juicy and filling. The fires are exceptional. Forget about other fast food chains!"}
{"text":"I would give them a zero if I could. There is no way they beat out in&out as best burger chain. First off, they weren't that busy and it too 25 minutes, soggy fries, burger was dry as hell. Price is great if If you have no active taste buds. Don't waste ur time or money here, go across the street to red robbin :("}
{"text":"Such good burgers,  my way! I love the grilled onions and mushrooms at Five Guys! Service is fast and the French fries are perfect! They have malt vinegar for the fries. The guys (and one girl tonight) are very pleasant, each offered a smile!"}
{"text":"I tried burgers in so many countries, by far the five guys burgers rank at the top for me. I usually don't go for the fries, don't get me wrong, they are fresh but a little oily and I prefer to get my calories from 2 burgers that a burger and fries. The staff have always been courteous in all the location I visited including but not limited to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service! I love how they announce how many folks are coming in. My burger was perfect and we were in and out within 15 mins. The one thing I didn't like and still don't is the fact that they wrap your burgers in foil when you order to go... It makes the buns a little soggy. I always immediately unwrap as soon as I get my food."}
{"text":"We ducked into a Five Guys while on a college visit in Pittsburgh years ago, needing a quick meal and not knowing what we'd stumbled into.  These were really good burgers, and the fries were bountiful and greasy-good.  When a Five Guys opened near my office, I took my assistant out for lunch, and she also became an aficionado.  The food is made fresh, the place is clean, but what really speaks to me is the quality of service - every time I have visited this Five Guys, I have been greeted with a smile, and never has my burger been other than how I ordered it.  This is not an every day place to eat (I wouldn't be able to fit through the door!), but for quick, good, and fun, this is on my go-to list."}
{"text":"It was our first time eating here. Burgers are really good. Had a little bacon cheeseburger all the way as suggested in the reviews. Loved the mushrooms and it has way more of a homemade taste another burger joints. We got a regular fries, which is big order and had a nice crunch/taste. We will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews for chain food places, I don't really see the point. They wouldn't be a chain if it didn't appeal to a large number of people.

This place is basically Johnny Rockets without the milk shakes, but with tons of toppings available for free. Value, in terms of pricing, is excellent. The menu is simple and it shouldn't take too long to figure out what you want if its your first time.

While you wait on your order you can work your way to the shelled peanuts which are self-serve and free. This is pretty cool I thought, and unlike Teakwoods, there aren't shells on the floor everywhere.

The toppings. Wow, tons of choices. I went with grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and jalapenos. The tomatoes and jalapenos were sliced too thick in my opinion, way too thick. However, the jalapenos were fresh, and not pickled. They were a little too spicy for me, but it was good. The lettuce wasn't so green, and to be quite honest I don't really remember seeing too much lettuce. Due to the sheer size of the toppings, it becomes a pain in stacking the burger and eating it.

BEEF! I'm a little mixed on how to rate the burger patties. I felt that they were a tad bit too dry for my taste, but that the texture was very interesting, unique, and enjoyable. I hate to bring up Lobby's into this review, but if there is one thing Lobby's does well its their patties. I'm stuck in an awkward situation here. I liked their patties, but I've had better. I'll leave it at that.

Cajun fries. The cajun fries were awesome. Its exactly what it sounds like, fries seasoned with cajun seasoning. Delicious. I ordered a regular, and I must have got two supersized fries instead of one regular. I think it must have been a mistake, because the large brown bag that your order comes in (whether you do dine-in or take-out) was FULL of fries. I tried to finish them all with my 9 year old brother and we couldn't do it, there was just too much. To make the situation worse, we brought home a cup full of fries. This isn't a bad thing, just don't order too much fries or you'll have a ton leftover.

This place is over decorated. Its annoying. Every inch of space is filled with non-local reviews for this place. Are you kidding me? Can you let me decide by myself whether your food is good or not? Of course, this is America and if something is a fashion you have to adhere to the fashion if you wanna be American. But anyways, besides the loads of what amounts to self-praise, the rest of the wall is covered in red and white checkers. Also, there ar not booths, just tables and chairs, which can get a little cramped at times.

Five Guys is a really good burger place, especially if you want a 'diner style' burger for a drive-thru price. You may or may not like the interior, but its a cool place to check out."}
{"text":"Five guys offers a basic selection of burgers, sandwiches, and hot dogs, with a plethora of toppings to choose from, free of charge! You can choose between a two patty burger (The regular size), or the \"little\" one patty size. Fries can either be plain or tasty Cajun style. 

I went with a \"little\" bacon cheeseburger. Don't let the moniker fool you- there is nothing little about this burger! It was a sizable portion of beef, with fresh, tasty ingredients. We also split a medium size order of Cajun fries.

I went with \"all the way\" minus mayo, and added jalapeno. \"All the way\" means basic ingredients you would typically find in your burger, outlined in black on the menu board. Such ingredients include mustard, ketchup, lettuce, pickles, tomato, grilled onion, grilled mushroom, and mayo. The more non-traditional toppings are outlined in red on the menu board, and include jalapeno, relish, and A1 sauce. 

Service was fast and friendly, and my burger and fries were made in no time.

The burger was nicely grilled, and the veggies were fresh and crisp. Even the jalapeno was fresh and thinly sliced. It packed a punch! The bacon was the equivalent of 1 strip on the burger, which was cooked nice and crisp. The grilled onions were a nice addition, but if you order them on your burger don't expect a lot of caramelized flavor on them since they'll taste a little more steamed than grilled.

The fries were delicious. The Cajun spice mix dusting them were a good addition. The medium size is a good size if you are sharing with someone.

The drink fountain is the cool \"create your own\" soda machine, with a multitude in diet and regular options. Orange flavored mello yello? Lime ginger ale? Vanilla diet barqs? Yes please!

Plus, any place that plays The Ramones in their restaurant is A-OK in my book!"}
{"text":"This is the favorite burger of our Commander-in-Chief, so who am I as a lowly tax-paying foot soldier to question the restaurant? As the fattest nation on Earth, this burger must shine as a golden example to the reason. The cheeseburger that I ordered could have easily fed a Somalian village and walking back to the light rail I am sure my already high blood pressure shot several points higher. I pray I finish this review before I succumb...

I wouldn't recommend ordering the burger with tomatoes. Not that they were bad, but they create a sliding factor that detracts from the dining experience. There are two options - wear half of the burger on your shirt or wolf it down in an attempt not to wear said burger and as a result fail to be able to enjoy the dining experience.  The price of the meal is a little higher than most, but so are the portions. As I described, the burger is enormous, and I ordered a regular size fry. The fries are served in a paper cup and more fries dumped in the sack. Really it was overkill because by the time I engulfed the burger, I really didn't want any fries - but this is a review about the whole meal so for you, dear reader, I pushed on ever so slightly. The fries are good - Cajun flavor and spicy. Good - yes. \"The best\" as the advertisements proclaim? I wouldn't say so. In comparing Five Guys to another recently opened gourmet burger joint, SmashBurger's rosemary fries are far superior. Five Guys outranks SmashBurger In terms of dining room size and available seating. Plenty of place to sit and attempt not to wear the burger. 

One thing I found as a huge distraction was the music. I don't want to sound like an old man, but turn that damn thing down! The radio was so loud it wasn't a pleasant experience. When you are trying to inhale a large cow cooked in 100% peanut oil, talking to your dining companion leaves limited opportunities. Say a few words and dive back in. What makes it annoying and difficult is that when you masterfully pull off this move, the partner continually says \"huh?\". 

Overall the burger was good and tasted grilled from the backyard. I know this will lose me points for being a fat guy and probably further lower my man-card status, but I don't think there needs to be two patties - one would suffice. The fries are too much too. I couldn't even finish the overflow in the bag, let alone touch the ones in the actual cup. For $11 for a burger, fries and drink ($5.59 burger, $2.59 regular Cajun fries, $2.19 large Cherry Coke)I felt like I wasted the fries and was so uncomfortable after gorging on the burger that I didn't enjoy the experience. Dare I say a smaller version of the meal would probably be a good opportunity for a future menu option."}
{"text":"I don't see what the hype is about although the food was good. Some say it's way better than In-N-Out but I think it's about the same. Their burgers have a genuine grilled smokey taste kind of like when Burger King's when it first came out and got popular. Of course the quality of FG is much much much muuuuch better than burger king because of their fresh and relatively healthier ingredients.

Their fries were crispy on the outside and soft inside. They are fresh potatoes too but have a different texture than in n out. I gotta say I love in n out fries but for those who hate in n out fries I would think you would love FG's fries. I think I heard that they fry their fries in peanut oil or something so if you have peanut allergies be sure to ask and if true, avoid for the sake your life!

Overall a great experience but nothing crazy."}
{"text":"The burgers... Taste like real beef and not fillers! Delicious! The fries weren't my favorite part of the meal. I had the Cajun, which I'm sure were more flavorful than the regular... But still nothing to write home about. They make up for it with the tasty burgers and drinks. Who doesn't love any place with a Coke Freestyle machine?! :-) I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Usually the service here is spot on.  Not tonight.  Ordered a double cheese with four things on it - lettuce, tomato, mushrooms, bacon.  Get home and they've added mustard and ketchup and no bacon.  Drive back over.  The remake the burger - with pickles.  Remake it a THIRD time and got it right. Zero attention to detail.  Would give zero or negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"Great burgers and a fun crowd.  This is a fun spot to hit when out with friends or your kids.  The lines can be crazy at times but free peanuts while you wait take the edge off."}
{"text":"Solid burger place, with staff generally knowledgable about GF options (and willing to scrape the grill without complaining.) I'm a fan of the hot dogs (sans bun, but with lots of toppings) and my partner loves the burgers with everything on it.

Fries are excellent, so long as they aren't underdone (the bane of thick-cut fries everywhere,) and free peanuts while you wait is also nice.

The State Street location means this place can get busy (and thus VERY noisy,) so if you go at peak times, be aware that it can be difficult to carry on a conversation, even with someone sitting just across the table from you."}
{"text":"Considering this is a pick-and-choose place, there's a lot of room for success and failure with the taste here, but based on the bacon burger I made yesterday, the food here is just above average. Pretty good burgers, and decent fries that come in big servings. Nothing super special about the taste or quality.

The appeal of Five Guys is in the charming set-up; the casual diner concept is cute, with the free peanuts at the door, and the lack of standard fast food corporate decor. The experience is refreshing; being able to personalize your burger, waiting for your order number to be called out, interacting with pleasant, happy staff. They do a great job keeping the place upbeat and clean! 

It's a unique place, and fun to eat at, definitely. Depending on preference, I can see why these burgers/fries are a favorite of so many, but they're not mine, so I'll probably be back only when someone else decides to tag me along. Plus points for the endless possibilities, though - I'll definitely branch out and try again the next time I end up there."}
{"text":"An American Chain has landed in Toronto.

I have to admit they make a mean burger but I think they are over rated as well. 
I had the mini cheeseburger which is one patty.  A reg one has 2 patties. 
One order of fries is good for 2 people. 

I enjoy the fact that they make the burger when you order on their grill so everything is freshly made, hot and not lying around.
The toppings are great as well... I LOVE mushrooms, and hot peppers option.
They are a little pricey for a burger joint - 2 burgers, 2 drinks and one order of fries came to about $22.

And like Jennifer said - I hope no one is allergic to peanuts because you can munch on those while you wait. 

Overall I dunno if they will last - They don't really overtop Harvey's or Licks in my opinion."}
{"text":"Okay Five Guys....You've won me over since the last time I partook in some meatygoodness that is a five guys burger.  

Our food wasnt as Gr---easeeeeeeeeeeyyyyy (In my best Paulie Shore voice) as it was last time.  Our canjun fries were nice and crispy.  

Well, at least the food didnt seem as greasy.  Though my lack of a gallbladder would have said differently about 30 minutes later.  Thank goodness Target and Burlington had clean bathrooms!  O_o  EEK!  :P"}
{"text":"Hello Five Guys goodbye In n Out! This blows away other fast food burger joints! First time here and won't be my last.

 Bacon cheeseburger with everything. I swear it tastes homemade with the grilled onions and mushrooms. Only change I would do is no ketchup and maybe ask for a different sauce next time. Fresh cut fries always a plus, got the cajun fries. Fries come in a paper cup that is filled then overfilled! Lots of fries were spilled in the bag too! That's a good thing!

Free roasted peanuts, help yourself! Never seen that before.

While eating two different workers came by and asked how everything was, very friendly. I also seen another worker helping a little girl get her soda from the new soda fountain.

Workers here actually seem like they love their jobs, don't see that too much."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town.  It's a little pricey but man is it worth it.  The cajun fries are simply amazing.  They have barrels of peanuts out for you to munch on while you wait for your food.  The employees are friendly too."}
{"text":"My least favourite burger chain. The food is way overpriced for what you actually get, they don't even use real cheese, and I'm sorry but the \"free peanuts\" do not make up for the sad burger we were served."}
{"text":"This is a really great place to eat.  The fries with vinegar are awesome.  Only thing that sucks is the price.  But sometimes you just gotta go for it and enjoy"}
{"text":"Always and forever will be a fan of this place. I've been to Five Guys spots all over town, and they are all fantastic. 
Consistently good burgers. 

I like mine with mushrooms and A1 (weird, I know). Their bacon cheeseburger is absolutely delectable.
Burgers are all double patties. 
ORDER A SMALL/REGULAR FRY - they dump a crap ton in the bag, along with a cupful of fries. Trust me, it'll be enough for a family of 4. Cajun fries - well done - are my personal favorite. 
Always clean. Always friendly. Always delicious!

If you weren't sold already... THEY HAVE PEANUTS!!!  ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"regular\" cheeseburger. It was a double stack. Got grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, mayo, lettuce, tomato, and green peppers. All toppings at no charge. My wife and I split a small fries and we had plenty. Burger was juicy and tasted great. Regular burger is under $8. One of our new favorites."}
{"text":"Best service! The 2 male employees were the friendliest yet. The food is pricey, i wish they offered kid options. But we love it anyhow. Love the peanuts & the outdoor seating was definitely a hot for out large group of 10!!!"}
{"text":"When I first walked into this place I thought \"$8.99 for just a burger? This burger better be good.\"
We ordered 2 bacon cheeseburgers, regular fries and a drink (~$27 with tax). Toppings such as grilled mushrooms, onions and pickles were free. Peanuts were also free!!
The burgers were much bigger than I expected and quite juicy. The fries were good but nothing too special.
Overall I would give them 3 stars since it was a bit pricey for a fast food place."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place.  Quick service, wonderful fresh food, cool coke machine and good fun.  I read a few reviews of this place below -  I don't mind the people outside because I don't notice them when I'm here.  Hey, its Tempe, get use to it.  I love Tempe!  The only few bad things are only two restrooms and a line at the super cool coke machines.  Please people just push the buttons.  It's like your touch screen phone.   LOL  Recommend this place very highly!!!!"}
{"text":"So I wanted to try out this place because everyone told me their burgers is really good.. But turn out its just another typical bad hype restaurant in Toronto. Their burgers and fries are bad and the price was WAY too much for a small burgers and a few fries. Overall this place is just hype and overpriced. Not recommended if you're trying something new to eat.

Tbh I can get better burgers and deals at McD's and paying cheaper."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to this establishment a few days ago, Thursday!  Hubby was EAGER to try an item from their secret menu....a patty melt....everything went off without a hitch. The patty melt was amazing, cuztomer service was BEYOND EXCELLENT. 

We went back to this establishment, because of how delicious the burger was and how we were treated so that I could try the patty melt, this time. We were met with the WORST employee they have. We attempted to order the patty melt, the cashier was combative qnd stated that its not a real thing...THIS EMPLOYEE made this experience we ultimatley left....she stated that she had been workong there for a while and that no one would know what the patty melt. This employee IS AN EMBARRASSMENT to this establishment...and ultimately costs this restaurant money and returning patrons. PATHETIC"}
{"text":"I order from this five guys quite frequently to go. It never fails just about every time I get home sit down at my table I open my burger there's ALWAYS something missing. 99% of the time it's the lettuce. How hard is it to read a ticket and put the stuff onto a burger. Holy cow."}
{"text":"When it comes to a satisfying and delicious abundance of calories, this is the place! The buns, the burgers, the fries are yummy! If you want to splurge on your healthy diet once and a while, do it here. 
I've never had a bad experience. The staff is polite, happy and eager to help fill your bellies! 
I like the soda machine. My husband likes filling up a sack with peanuts. The food is delicious and worth the extra expense. Yum! Yum!"}
{"text":"We've only grabbed it to go which in my opinion is the better option, you don't have a ton of space.  

Burgers were delicious, definitely living up to the hype I've heard from others.  Price point isn't too bad and serving sizes are generous.  We have a family of 4 and split 2 orders of fries with plenty left over.  It will probably replace In and Out as our go to burger place near the house."}
{"text":"No frills classic Hamburger joint for over inflated prices. 

Definitely nothing wrong with the burgers or fries from Five Guys. Burgers have an old school feel but you can get better burgers and fries in the city for a fraction of the price. I'd rather go to burger's priest or big smoke myself.

Love that they have free shelled peanuts to eat while you wait. And the food is good, but over 14 dollars for a fast food burger and fries, and no drink isn't great value... Also the cheese on the burgers weren't fully melted. They have all the classic burger toppings you need but nothing interesting. Also they gave us tons of fries, probably too many. There was like a second helping of fries in the bag. BAG FRIES! Also the Cajun style fries arent all that spectacular...

Definitely worth a try if you've never been before, but not on my list of places I'd have to return."}
{"text":"Huge fan! Wish there was one of these in Alaska.  If your looking for a quick bite to eat that is \"healthier\" than your average drive-in burger stop, this is the place to go. You can build your own burger, with or with out all the fixings. The sling patty is more than enough, but if your really hungry...go for the double. The large fry would feed at least three grown adults! Try the frys with cajan seasoning. DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"BEWARE of this location!! I love 5 Guys, but this location is very sub-par. I understand that 5 Guys is pricier, but that's because one expects perfection. Been here 3 times at this location and each time I've been disappointed. First off, the unsweet tea had a weird cleaner taste to it. The peanuts always taste like they are rancid and old, the tomato on my burger was mushy, and my French fry was dry and short changed. Won't be coming back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Five Guys is delicious! The burgers are juicy and fresh and the fries are usually good! However, sometimes they can be soggy! Overall, this place is legit!"}
{"text":"Sorry Five Guys but our relationship is over. 
The place was PACKED and the service was moving at a snail's pace. It took us forever to get our burgers. I decided to go with the Little Bacon Cheeseburger & my husband went with the Bacon Burger. After waiting for about 30 minutes in line, it was finally time to place the order! So exciting!!
When I finally received the order and took my first enormous bite, they messed up my order. Instead of receiving a Little Bacon Cheeseburger, I received a large burger with mushrooms... no cheese..... no bacon... I wanted to cry. Not to mention there was absolutely NO point in attempting to tell the cook the order was wrong seeing as how I had to go BACK in line and wait another 30+ minutes.. Yea, no thanks. 
2 burgers set us back something like $30.... seriously? No... Sorry, I've moved on"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good burgers!! I would definitely come back here.

Ordered a Hamburger, comes with 2 patties, 3.5oz each, $7.69 plus tax is $8.69.

Didn't get a drink, but the fountain pop has unlimited refills. 

Overall the burger tasted pretty good!! It had a distinct flavour - which I enjoyed. It was greasy and I could tell it wasn't made from high-end pure beef.. But it still tasted really good and satisfying!

Giving it 4 stars because the overall price is good value. Don't understand why people are giving this place a low rating because it's expensive..

Otherwise the burger itself would be 3.5+ stars."}
{"text":"Okay... I've been hearing about this place since it opened and I figured that with it being across the street from and In-N-Out and still in business, it had to be amazing. I was very disappointed. The food was very expensive and the quality was only average. I really liked all the options for the burgers but the limited menu is just a little too limited. Only serving fries as a side is just not that interesting no matter how much season salt you shake on them. They had the awesome new Coca-Cola machines which was really neat to play with but where are the milkshakes and malts? This is a burger joint, gotcha, but I would like to see some creativity in my meal, especially at these prices. Maybe the free peanuts run up the cost of overhead..."}
{"text":"I'll give an extra half-star for the peanuts during the wait. The hamburgers are fine, however I feel guilty after eating one because they seem a bit greasy/fattening. I think the prices are too high, which is the main reason I don't go often. They give a lot options to customize the burger  is probably the reason behind the higher prices."}
{"text":"Must have been the day and time, Sunday-3PM....not enough heat (temperature) on the pattie and a little too much devil may care attitude.   Guess I'll stick to the one by Concord Mills."}
{"text":"The food is ok, about the same as any other Five Guys. This location is one of the few dining spots open late night in Uptown, so enter at your own risk after standard dinner time! I've been here late at night and there was a cop inside standing watch - made me uneasy. And of course a majority of customers after a certain hour have been over served at a nearby bar. Could be good people watching or could be dangerously close to a drunken brawl. Like I said, dine at your own risk..."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful customer service and delicious food!!! Had a mix up in our burger order and the manager not only immediately remedied the problem, but also comped a free drink, accompanied with a smile. The manager on staff Amanda handled it all with such professionalism and speed, I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"After all the hype and excitement about this place I gave it a try.... not impressed.  Expensive for an average burger.  The only thing that was cool was the free peanuts but then again, not a huge fan of peanuts with hamburgers.  GO TO SMASH BURGER INSTEAD!!!"}
{"text":"Over priced...$19 for 2 burgers, fries and a drink.

The burger was served in a brown bag, wrapped in foil. the bun was soggy and not very good. The meat in the burger has no flavor. Very disappointing.

The fries, again, soggy and no flavor.

For the money, I would go the the Burger Bar instead. 

I still love IN-N-Out burger. Great food, great price.

BTW, 5 guys has posters about them being the \"Best Bang For The Buck\"  Not even close. 

We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Had a client that wanted to try this place. I've been to other locations and the burgers were pretty bad. 

This location follows in the footsteps of the others. 

The burger was tasteless. Zero flavor. The bun was wet. Not damp, WET. Not sure if it was grease or \"sweat\" from being wrapped up. Either way, it was gross. 

Over priced and poor quality. My client agreed as she had about 3 bites and that was all. 

We both left hungry and disappointed. 

There are far too many other great burgers places in town. Don't waste your money or time at 5 guys."}
{"text":"There are customer service concerns. I came in and ordered a sandwich. There was already a person waiting on their order and not a single person on the grill. 5 minutes later they started which means I had to wait at minimum 15 minutes for grilled cheese. Unacceptable in my eyes"}
{"text":"Very simple hamburgers, hot dogs, veggie sandwiches, fries, and shakes.  People enjoy shucking and eating what they think are free peanuts in the entrance way, but you pay for it as it is built into the menu prices. There is nothing to justify their over priced product from the consumer side. It's fast food that is charged at restaurant rates. I'm sure their overhead cost is a factor for their own concerns, but if that's the case they might as well surrender to Smashburger, Fuddruckers, and Steak and Shake."}
{"text":"After hearing a bunch of hype about this place, I went and tried it a few minutes ago! WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!  I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger, made it a double, along with some Cajun fries and a drink. When my order came up, everything was buried under greasy, limp fries in a paper bag, and I had to tear the bag open to get at my burger. The serving portion of fries was ridiculously huge-no one could eat all of those, and as I said, they were greasy and limp-YUCK!!. The burger, while the ingredients were obviously fresh, lacked one very important thing: FLAVOR! Sorry 5 Guys, but In & Out is better, and SmashBurger is WAY better...First impressions mean everything, and I was not impressed in the least. Sorry guys, I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Over priced burgers, and no kids menu. The burger was bland from no seasoning. When I asked about a kids menu, the cashier said we do not have one but our food is fresh. Fresh is not a way to make me happy that I am paying $7.00 for a little burger that should be half the price and the size for kids. So I give this place a F for family friendly dinning menu options. 
    Even the burger that I got was not worth the price, so I do not recommend Five Guys."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite burger chains and one of my friends was getting a haircut at a neighboring business so I decided to enjoy a burger and fries while I waited.  When I walked in there were a bunch of military people who all stopped and stared but, I later found out there was war games going on that weekend.  I ordered, grabbed a seat and waited.  I grabbed my order and some malt vinegar for my fries.

The burger and fries were just as good here as the other locations that I have been to and the restaurant was clean and tidy.  There was also close parking in the shopping center lot."}
{"text":"Burger was good but a little over price if you ask me . Nothing amazing but still good ."}
{"text":"Last night was a pivotal moment in my fast food dining experiences. I finally tried Five Guys Burgers.

  Five Guys burgers taste superior to the burger chains. It ought to considering that a cheeseburger, medium fries, and medium coke is approximately $12.

  This is why I am a fan of Five Guys food. The thick and juicy cheeseburger that is cooked in front of you is favorable to the tastebuds. With the exception of beacon, the toppings are complimentary.  The fries that are served in a cup are quality. Five Guys stands by their fries and proudly displays where they came from. There is not a few choices of fountain Coke A Cola. There are 108 flavors. I recommend Peach  Fanta and Strawberry Sprite. For the record, before you order, you have the option of filling a cup with complimentary peanuts.

  If you don't have a headache, Five Guys is an upbeat environment. The food is prepared in front of your eyes. The cooks get really into it and scream out the orders when they are ready for you to pick up. They communicate out loud when they cook the food. I would hear them shouting out the famous John Belushi catch phrase, \"cheeseburger cheeseburger.\" Depending if you have a headache and your mood, the yelling in the open kitchen can be entertaining or it can be annoying. The best thing happening in the kitchen is the food being prepared in front of you.

  The dining area is brightly lit. The walls display framed accolades on Five Guys from major newspapers. The restaurant has sufficient seating and two Coke machines.

  When you add the service and lower the price Five Guys is worthy of four stars. The employees were helpful, put on a good show in the open kitchen, and were friendly to the point of showing me where an electric outlet was and volunteering to dump our trash.

   Five Guys is pricey. If it was less expensive it would be 4 stars. As it currently stands I rate Five Guys 3 &1/2 stars."}
{"text":"If your choice of burger is sloppy, then this is your spot.  

The trend of all these burger places continues unabated however, 5 Guys really does nothing extraordinary despite this reinvention of the wheel.

The plus is the ample selection of condiments to add on the foundation that is your burger, but the very same foundation is cracked and flawed.

The burger is small and flimsy, quickly cooked up on a greasy hot plate.  Judging by the before and after, what does look like a nice fresh patty quickly shrinks to a tiny puck that does little to cover the bun.  This is all too common with ground beef that has a high margin of fat. Shrinkage can be avoided with better cuts of beef and better ratio of fat to beef.

The toppings are fresh but once said and done, the first bite quickly brings to mind the old Wendy's adage of \"where's the beef?\".   In fact, after all this, Wendy's may have been a better choice, at least I could have a small chilli and cheese with my burger.

Fries, can't complain.  They were good but why people go on about their Cajun fries like it's a new thing is beyond me.  Even Mikes started serving these decades ago under the heading of spicy fries, just unfortunate in their case they went with frozen over fresh.

Overall, there is way better out there, avoid the line up for this temporary niche, and maybe find the nearest Dic Annes. Way I see it, if Johnny Rockets which made an awesome burger couldn't survive the high standards of Montreal, then it's only a matter of time before 5 Guys goes the way of Krispy Kreme....  Some highly commercial US eatery that may look great on the food channel when Guy Fieri chomps down on it, but once North of the border, it loses it's appeal in the face of burger joints new and old which have real character and charm rather than a box of salty peanuts."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying, my girlfriend and I are mad burger fans! We relish in the smells and textures of a quality burger everywhere we go and are often on the hunt for the next great burger. 
     Upon entering this facility the cleanliness and upkeep of the restaurant jumped out at us. The place was spacious and the man at the cash register happily gave us a run down of the menu while some wholesome classic rock jammed in the background.
     We ended up deciding on two bacon cheeseburgers and got the large fry to share, which in hindsight was a bad idea because a small would have been plenty. We wasted food despite our best efforts. 
     One thing I have to mention is the incredible drink dispensers they had at this location. I have never seen anything like it. They are futuristic touch screen dispensers with I dare say, dozens of refreshments to choose from. My girlfriend had a problem finding the button to push to get the drink. It was the lit \"push\" button not the ice dispenser. We settled on a vanilla coke and I got some of their peanuts which are offered in unlimited amounts!
     As for the burgers, they were juicy, tender, and the ingredients all blended very well. We chose the regular ones with two patties which was very filling. You can get one patty if you order the smaller burger.  
     Everything seemed very fresh that was put into this, which is very nice for a change in a fast food restaurant! We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I tried the regular cheese burger (regular has double patty) and regular fries. For just the burger and the fries it came out to 14.50. A bit pricey, but a good greasy spoon is worth it to some degree. 
The burger was tasty.  It reminded me of a Wendy's style patty, flavor - wise as well as texture. But if it tastes kinda like Wendy's and is all natural, that works for me. Those fast food chains are huge for a reason. It was seasoned well and the ingredients and condiments were fresh. 
The fries were good as well. Nothing to write home about, but also tasty. 
All in all, It was more than I wanted to pay, but I was satisfied with my meal. I give it a 3.5."}
{"text":"J'ai mang√© une poutine, le go√ªt √©tait passable mais c'est pas digerable ! √ânorme mal de ventre moi et mon amie m√™me 6 heures apr√®s avoir manger. J'y retourne pas certain."}
{"text":"I dream about getting burgers from this place. Maybe it's a little more then I would normally pay for a burger but it's worth it. The fries are so tasty and great selection of soda."}
{"text":"Five guys is three too many for burgers, and four for dogs which leaves a guy each for sides and register duty. Yes, you get infamous fries and there's sacks of spuds all over place but by the time you get to eat them the starchy magic has been lost to the hype.
All in all it's a good little $5.00 burger that will set you back $7.00 all fancied up with bright fresh fruit and veggies: tomato, lettuce, onion, pickles, peppers, and other peppers...
Regardless, I totally don't get the split hot dogs. Either get a better bun or a better hot dog or both."}
{"text":"It's Five Guys, there's not a thing I dislike really. Great location convenient to home. Their burgers are always made perfectly. Like a heart attack caked in grease and fat. So delicious!

I always order the junior bacon and cheese. Usually that along with a small fry is plenty of food for me. I have never actually attempted to eat the \"normal\" sized burger they offer here. I get mine with saut√©ed onions and shrooms and barbecue sauce. Simple but flawless in my mind.

The service at most Five Guys places, this one included, could probably be a bit more friendly. But I don't honestly expect much when I'm being served by folks on minimum wage. I just want everybody to have a good day is that too much to ask?! Oh right. This is a review. And uh...don't forget to put the seasoning on your fries! ;) PS: don't eat the peanuts..."}
{"text":"The Five Guys of choice for any night out (or night in) in Plaza Midwood. Close to plenty of drinking. What better way to fill your gut when you're out for a beer. I've never seen this location particularly busy. Which is surprising when you compare it to the one down in The Epicenter.

The service has always been as fast as possible - which isn't really all that fast at Five Guys. And the friendliest I've ever found at any Five Guys location. Yes, prices are steep but these are seriously quality burgers. Really though, I guess you could find burgs for this price at a sit-down restaurant. But at least here there's no tipping. Of course let's not forget the fries! There's a chalkboard proclaiming where today's fries are from. Usually somewhere in Idaho. Don't forget to ask for the seasoning. Don't overdo it though; it gets spicy. To round off your meal they also have some dang good milkshakes.

If you've never been, you may want to start with the little burgers. The ones without little in the name have a double patty in them. These things are filling. I always get the little bacon cheeseburger with sauteed shrooms and onions and BBQ sauce. I'm craving it now just thinking about it..."}
{"text":"The place is decent.  I still like Tommy's and In-n-Out better.  I saw a sign that said that they were voted \"Best Value\" somewhere.  2 Cheeseburgers, 2 sodas and a regular sized fry for $19.78.  I'm not exactly sure where that's a value, but anyhow.  It's a decent place that was busy, but I'm not sure that I'll be a regular here."}
{"text":"Seriously, there are better burgers to be had elsewhere, almost anywhere.
While I was glad they were open on Easter, I wasn't so glad once tasting their burger.  For 10.00 for a cheeseburger, small fries, and a medium drink, I expect much better taste."}
{"text":"There's magic in every burger and Five guys' is very magical! I do believe I get what I pay for :)"}
{"text":"I had been to the Eastern location and the Lake Mead location about a year ago, thought both were ok. So, I was excited when the Sunset location opened because it is a lot closer to home. Took my 8 yr old for lunch, both of us had the smallest burger, ordered 1 large fry, and 2 drinks....was about $22! A little pricey I think. Both of us ate less than half of our burger and only a few fries and then we didn't feel good. I think we got sick from the fries because they were so greasy they were disgusting! If we want a burger we usually go to In n Out or Pitstop (in BC), think we will stick with our regular burger joints in the future. 
The staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"From Dr. Nick, Simpsons: \"And remember, if you're not sure about something, rub it against a piece of paper.  If the paper turns clear, it's your window to weight gain!\"  

Here, you don't even need to rub it against the bag to figure out if it's the window to weight gain because it soaks through the bag before you'll even have the chance.  

That said, I don't care.  The burgers are good.  And the generous, no that doesn't quite capture it, stupidly large amount of fries that you get even with their smaller size is pretty sweet.  Fries taste like they really did just cut all those potatoes that they leave laying all over the place in bags.

You can throw the shells from the free peanuts on the floor.  Kind of fun, but i'm just not sure it's really that hard to put them in a basket or something.

Finally, they rarely actually got my order exactly right.  It's nice you can customize, but get more than 2 different things, and you'll get a different burger than you've ordered."}
{"text":"I went to five guys at noon on a saturday, even though it was extremely packed me and my girlfriend managed to get in and out with our food in about 10 minutes which surprised me. The employees were also very friendly."}
{"text":"Super delicious juicy fresh burgers! Strawberry shake was amazing too with bits of strawberry!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for burgers and fries but it sure beats all the drive-thru burger joints! The fries are delicious and my favorite! I've heard the shakes are awesome so I will have to try that next time. Burgers with grilled mushrooms and onions - YUMMY! A+"}
{"text":"I'm sorry what? I never reviewed this one? Weird. Anywho. Five Guys has the best burgers there is and of story. Fries, not so much but they work. The Hot Dogs are pretty nifty. But seriously, it's all about the burgers.... trust me. Big fat greasy cheesy burgers, the way they were meant to be."}
{"text":"Holy cow these guys make all my fry dreams come true!!! Every time I come I just notice how much fries are in my order and their burgers are just bomb.com! Thank you for great service guys. Totes recommend this location."}
{"text":"Fan of Five Guys and adding all the toppings you can have on your burger without paying extra for it. Also love the fact they fill your bag up with fries, some of you neat freaks may not like this but re heated in a toaster oven they are even better. My recommendation is to share an order of fries because they really give you a lot. Also the drink machines are very futuristic at some locations don't be afraid to call for help if you don't know what you are doing. 

This is good burger. I think it is better then Applebee's or Chile's and half the cost."}
{"text":"One burger raw, one cooked, fries were not cooked at all, service seemed rushed although place was empty. Example, my husband who was not wearing his glasses asked was the kosher dog good and the reply was \"it's the only one we have\". Plenty of seating inside and out, just was not happy at all with the meal. Threw half away, a shame for the cost. Will not be back, gave two stars because one burger and one dog were fine."}
{"text":"Friendly, quick, correct and delicious. All I really expect from slightly overpriced fast food and would gladly overpay for again."}
{"text":"ordered one little burger, one lil cheese burger and a reg.cajun fry. these fries are like a super size mcdonald fry. which sucks you can't get any small size.  however the fries are super delicious. the little burgers are just single patty rather than double patty which is tricky thinking you'll get something tiny bc it was a gd huge size.  i found it expensive for a fast food joint (costing approx 17 dollar for two small burger and a fry- no combos available). this is def worth the try and i myself would return. p.s.  extemely filling!"}
{"text":"First time visiting a five guys! Can you believe it!? I stopped here for a friend who was craving it and so glad he was, because it was delicious! The burgers are made fresh right in front of you, along with any buildable burger toppings you want (mushrooms, onions, ketchup etc). Frys, shakes...... great burger joint! Good flavor, cooked how you want it. If you are looking for a fast food burger, stop by one of their locations. Nice and quick, clean and really nice staff. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"This is our second trip to a Five Guys - actually the second Five Guys location, not the second time we've been there - and they seem to have the concept down, as it's about the same each time we've been there.

While my judgment is still out on the fries, I am really digging the burgers.  The only problem is that, even with the large burger (that is, two patties), the burgers seem a little small.  The problem with that is that they're a bit expensive, so eating a couple of them can add up pretty quickly.  They taste good, they just seem so tiny that I feel like a giant when I eat them.

(moved from the wrong location - hate it when that happens)"}
{"text":"Some say that Five Guys has the best burgers around.  I'm really inclined to agree.  They are really good, probably because they don't dilute the menu with chicken or fish.  You will find that there is a bit of variety - a garden burger, a hot dog, a veggie burger, and that's about it.

The larger burger is simply two patties, and you can get it with cheese.  That's where the selection ends for the meal itself.  You can get fries too.  More on that in a minute.  The choice doesn't really end there, however, because you can get whatever you want on the burger - lettuce, tomato, onion (grilled onions as well), mushrooms, mayo, mustard, ketchup, hot sauce, peppers, the list goes on and on.

What is probably the most amazing is that the burgers themselves are really good.  The staff is friendly.  The prices aren't bad, if a bit higher than you'll pay at McDonald's - but again, it's worth the difference, because the quality is there, so it's a good tradeoff.

The only potential downside is the fries.  If you get there when it's busy, or when they aren't paying attention, you might get some that have been sitting for a while and aren't fresh out of the fryer.  If that's the case, then they aren't going to be good.  They have to come out fresh or they are soggy and nasty.  Other than that, two thumbs up for Five Guys.  Way up."}
{"text":"Their cajun fries have become my true weakness. The atmosphere is fun and clean. The staff is very accommodating. The burger combo was generous in size. Walked away feeling very full and satsfied."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this location. I'm eating the delicious Cajun fires that are perfectly seasoned and a burger with mayo, ketchup, grilled mushrooms and lettuce that is juicy and delicious! I also loved seeing a sign that gave the name of the local company that supplied the fries!"}
{"text":"This location just recently opened and after a very stressful day at work with a very late lunch, I wanted comfort food. And sometimes a juicy hamburger is the perfect comfort food. And after having a horrible experience with the Five Guys out South on Eastern I felt they were due for a second chance. 

Ordering was fast, service was friendly, and I like all the various options you can choose to load up your burger with. I ordered the spicy fries and was handed a drink cup. After paying I turn and...whoa, what's this? Do I see the new Super Coke machines? Why yes I do and there's two of them. At this point even if the food sucks, I get vanilla cherry Coke and life is good. 

I pick up my food and I'm like dang these fries are good. Too good as I'm through half of them before I remember I got a burger to try. Unlike my first experience, this one was what I expected it to be, and my faith in Yelp and other sources in saying Five Guys really was all that had been restored. 

Overall I wish the fries had been a bit crispier, but the bacon cheeseburger was perfect, and the vanilla cherry Coke was awesome. (I'm not supposed to have any Coke these days so this was a treat for me). 

4 Stars for Five Guys...and yeah I won't come back too often as it's bad for me, but one can not live on Thai food alone which seems to be what I eat a lot of these days."}
{"text":"I got asked for money 3 times by homeless people between the curb and the door. Once inside, the music was so loud, the staff was actually yelling to be heard and take an order. A bacon cheeseburger and drink (no fries) was $10.70, and was really bland. I don't understand how anyone likes this place or it stays in business."}
{"text":"Boring, greasy, and blah overpriced hamburgers served in a hyperactive environment with excessive lighting and circus peanuts. 

In-N-Out on their worst day with a drive through line around the block beats the socks off of Five Guys. 

Try it once only if you want to be part of the over hyped clamor about this place. But if you want a really good burger, it's In-N-Out's Double Double, Animal Style hands down. Skip the zoo of gullible humanity and circus peanuts, your wallet and stomach will be a lot happier a couple blocks further down the street."}
{"text":"The Hype doesn't live up. 

This is not the first Five Guys Ive enjoyed(there's one less than a mile from my house), but decided to review this one. I will start off by saying I enjoy 5 guys. I think they have a good tasting burger, fries, and hot dogs. I don't think they live up to the hype though... 

I like that they give you the options of what you get on the burger in regards to condiments(onions, lettuce, jalapenos, etc) 
(Which this isnt a new concept \"having it your way\" though)

Hotdogs cut down the middle to lay flat on a bun works well, but just doesnt seem the same (not sure why though)

My big complaint is the price. I think it is way too high for what it is. When a hamburger cost 5 plus bucks. Fries are close to $3. and the drinks are $2 Lunch gets expensive quick. 

The other, when they wrap the burger or hot dog they seem to squish the burger and when you unwrap it, it looks like a linebacker wrapped the thing and its all squished together... 

My search for a great fast cheap hamburger continues... but I will eat here again."}
{"text":"I am a Huge fan! I love a place where you can get some peanuts while you wait for your food. They use peanut oil to cook their food as well. 

This place is clean, friendly, and good food. What else can you ask for? 

I am a fan of In N out, I think they have fresh burgers too. BUT this place blows them out of the water. The burgers are cooked right there in front of you, the ingredients are always fresh and good, I love the sign telling you where their potatoes came from today. 

A simply menu that can be extraordinary. You can hand pick whatever you want on your burger at no extra charge. My choice is grilled onions bacon and cheese."}
{"text":"Had a fun time with our new grandson at 5 guys. Great burgers. The new mom wanted a cheese burger and this hit the spot.  Wow fries are great. Good prices for a lot of fries. 3 of us split one large order of fries.  I had a veggie burger, it was good. The shakes looked great but we didn't try one maybe next time. Was clean and the servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"Great place... My brother in law from California told me about this place. The employees were so helpful when it came to ordering... And the hamburgers are so good.. Better than in & out. :) They also have a cool coke machine."}
{"text":"I definitely prefer In&Out to Five Guys as far as taste in their burgers, however Five Guys fries are so much better than In & Out's shrimpy little ones. I guess it's just a matter of east vs. west coast and where you are. I do find Five Guys more filling than In&Out as well, but I think their meat is less flavorful at Five Guys...

When I'm Pittsburgh and there is no freakishly cheap In&Out, this is one of the only fast food places I would go."}
{"text":"I was truly excited to try Five Guys because of all the wonderful things I've heard and basically, the hype around it. My brother and I ventured one afternoon and I was less than pleased. I did enjoy the fact that everyone was extremely friendly and not being charged for extra patties! Plus, the restaurant itself is nice and I was mesmerized by the high-tech soda machine (I wish I were able to utilize it, but no soda for me!). 

Our cashier, also really nice and friendly, was clueless about their ingredients! Their menu states one of the toppings to be \"green peppers\" and since I was unfamiliar with their burgers, I asked her what type of green peppers the menu was referring. Confusion. I continued, \"Are they green BELL peppers, green CHILI peppers..?\" The cashier responded, \"Oh yeah, they're peppers, but, uh, I don't think they're spicy.\" All right...so I thought, okay some roasted or marinated green peppers? That sounds good on a burger. So I ordered two patties with green peppers, onions, lettuce, and tomato. My brother and I shared regular fries and cajun fries.

You can imagine my disappointment when I opened my wrapper and realized that my first assumption of green bell peppers was right, but the cashier failed, not only to acknowledge that thought, but told me otherwise. How can you not know that your restaurant serves green bell peppers?? I amounted this to, hopefully, ignorance. It didn't add to a good experience for me because had I known they were bell peppers, I wouldn't have ordered it. Who wants raw bell peppers on their burger? It was so awkward. Plus, my burger was absolutely flavorless. I actually had to season my own burger with salt and pepper. I probably should have ordered cheese and condiments, but a good burger shouldn't have to rely on those accompaniments. The burger was tender and cooked well though. The fries were also good. I love handcut fries, so this was no exception. The cajun fries though, I will pass. I love cajun seasoning, but I felt like I was inside their shaker of cajun. It was SO overwhelming that it took away from the pleasantry of the fries.

I don't know; my brother really enjoyed his burger and I take partial blame for not ordering my burger with cheese and other condiments to add flavor (I was trying to be healthier), but the burger shouldn't be flavorless alone! The fries are really great though (without the cajun drowning). So, I may take another stab at Five Guys - get a completely different burger and enjoy the fries..we'll see."}
{"text":"Music is WAY too loud... But the food is good and the portions are huge. I'll probably wait for the hype (and the line) to die down a bit before coming back though."}
{"text":"This is the second Five Guys I've tried and I must say food is consistent wherever you go. Prices however are pretty expensive for what you get. Ordered 2 burgers and small fries for $20+ not including drinks. Honestly, I don't think it's worth the hype in my opinion. The burgers aren't anything extraordinary and it gets pretty messy when you eat it. Fries are a little bland and tasteless too. However, quality is there. This location isn't too busy so service wasn't bad. For the price and amount of food you get though, I'd rather go to an A&W or Wendy's and have myself a whole combo for half the price."}
{"text":"Well back again will need to find a different place. It's so gross the health department needs to pay a visit. Don't understand why 6 employees in the back with only 2 cooking. The only female finally cleaned some tables but only half way she couldn't be bothered to clean the chairs nor tidy up the floor. Someone emptied the trash with no use of PPE on, and never seen him was his hands. We received our food before he went to the back but still"}
{"text":"Stopped here with my wife and daughter after hearing a few friends say it was amazing,.........Very disappointing, I mean the burgers aren't terrible but they are not great either Just kinda there you know what I mean. pretty pricey as well I think 3 burgers and 1 large order of fries and 3 drinks was like $27. In and out is a much tastier and affordable option."}
{"text":"Now I live on the East Coast.  Now I have no In n Out Burger.  Now I weep.

It's comparable in taste to In N Out.  The boyfriend and I split a standard cheese burger with everything (except mayo).  I found it to be completely serviceable in flavor and meat quality.  
Eating the damned thing is a challenge all on its own!  How the hell am I supposed to get my mouth around this thing?
My main issues was the complete lack of structural integrity the burger had.  In mere minutes it turned into a sloppy mess.

Perhaps the next time I will get some of the other toppings and Jr. size to see if that helps with how average this burger was.  

Peanuts are interesting.....I guess?  

The fries were perfectly cooked and while the cajun seasoning was tasty, 
HOLY GOD HOW TO PEOPLE CONSUME THAT MUCH SALT!  
Unreasonable portions and astronomical salt levels."}
{"text":"This visit was my first to 5 Guys and it was pretty okay. I have heard the In n Out/5 Guys comparisons and I am on team InO but I always welcome a competing burger. Ordering was pretty simple. I had a little bacon cheeseburger with some basic toppings and cajun style fries. It took a little while for our food to come out, which was a sign of them making it fresh as you can see into the kitchen. The fries were okay (I did enjoy the cajun option), the burger was okay - neither blew me away, especially for the price, but I wouldn't object to coming back."}
{"text":"We love Five Guys burgers, love the fries, love how clean the restaurants are every time. They are doing just a couple things and they are doing them right. After a morning in Gaffney, we stopped in, filled up on delicious burgers and headed out for more furniture shopping. A safe choice every time!"}
{"text":"Quick, fresh, reasonably priced, clean! The burgers are consistent; we've been several times with no complaints. Probably one of the better chain options near Concord Mills."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had hyped this place up for the past week and so I was definitely excited to take it for a test drive. When we arrived, it was during lunch hours and the place was pretty busy, but we walked right up to the front and placed our order. I went with a bacon cheeseburger, and let me tell you, this thing was no joke! I asked for extra crispy bacon, mayo, and ketchup and everything was prepared as I had requested. Lots of flavor, two thick and  juicy patties, and enough grease to power an alternative fuel vehicle...quite tasty. Between three of us, we split a small order of Cajun fries and they were pretty decent. The thicker the cut of the fry, the soggier they were, but not bad. Our food was prepared quickly, and the service was good for being as busy as they were. As mentioned, this isn't the most cost effective meal if you're on a budget, but for the quality of the food I'm ok with that. Will definitely be back when I need a burger fix for lunch. Nice work, Five Guys."}
{"text":"The burger was just ok the fries were alot for one person. it was a bit pricey. The music is was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo loud that the young lady taking the order couldn't even hear us,."}
{"text":"Delicious! I loved my burger option of lettuce wrap instead of bun, it was awesome. The Cajun fries are fabulous."}
{"text":"A buddy of mine, Shawn, picked up 3 big thick juicy and delicious burgers with well fried French fries for me, him and my brother. Even after bringing them home they tasted hot and fresh like they were just made - 

D-Lish-Us"}
{"text":"I am beyond thrilled that the University area has a 5 guys! We were desperately in need of more fast casual restaurants, and five guys absolutely delivers in this regard. The concept is simple and because of this, they have been so successful! Pro tip: The \"Little\" Hamburger is so filling and cheaper than the regular! Also try your burger \"all the way\" and you will love all the delicious toppings on a perfectly grilled beef patty. Now the thing that truly puts five guys over the edge is the fries. These fries are made from real potatoes in house and fried to perfection. Try the Cajun seasoning if you are feeling daring and don't forget the malt vinegar if you want to bring back memories of county fairs. The prices are on point with other fast casual but have a much better product than say Hwy 55 or Smashburger. Milkshakes are good but not mindblowing and its always great to have Coke freestyle machine to wet your whistle."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 5/5
Happiness - 5/5

I grew up near the original Five Guys in Virginia. It was in a shady part of town yet droves of people would make the journey due to the high quality of the food. I love to see how they have grown, and are so spick and span, especially this location at CityScape.

This location always has friendly employees - engaging and efficient! The burgers are absolutely delicious and they don't nickel and dime you on the toppings - as many toppings as you want come with the price of the burger.  They are grilled fresh.

But as amazing as the burgers are (and they really are), the fries are the stars of the show. I prefer the Cajun fries, but either way, they are thick and fresh and taste like they used to be a potato. Plus you get a ton of fries. One large order can be split three-ways. And they always make sure to dump a bunch of stray fries into your bag. The trick to a good 5 Guys fries experience - tear the top half of your bag off, dump the fries in the cup into the bag with the fries at the bottom, and enjoy with a cup of the malt vinegar they have there. 

The one thing they haven't nailed are the newly-added milkshakes. Too thick and lacking the delicious sweetness of their competitors like Fuddruckers, Johnny Rockets or Shake Shack. I would personally save the calories and forego the shakes."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed. Every time I come to eat here the whole crew including the manager, never washes their hands after handling cash, instead they work on their orders touching my food and everyone else .. It's very unsanitary and unprofessional, I come here 4 times out of the week I hope this can get situated ..."}
{"text":"We stopped by this Five Guys because we were up in the neighborhood. I don't even remember when I ate a Five Guys. Place was clean and very empty. The manager reviewed the menu with us, very friendly. We ordered 2 small burgers, one with cheese, bacon, lettuce, the other had tomato, lettuce, onion, and pickle. We also ordered a small fry and a chocolate malted milk shake.

We paid and sat down and waited, waited and waited. We noticed another order was in front of ours. It seemed a lot of chit chatting in the food prep area was going on because it took so long. Food was good for a burger joint (no calorie watching here), order came out correctly. 

My only comment was the wait time, service good, food good, I will say Five Guys far far better than Shake Shack in my opinion."}
{"text":"Tasty Americana - \"Everything On It\"   -  Oh, they mean business - I'll be back"}
{"text":"MAN do I LOVE a good burger. More than a good burger I love being entertained. The cook shouts out every step in the process, the guest service is 5 star and the hamburger comes wrapped in tin foil so it is nice and hot when you are ready!!!! Best part everyone is happy here. Old timey hand cut fries burgers are juicy hot on a thin 50's style bun. Come for the food stay for the show!"}
{"text":"the fries are FANTASTIC, and the burger is good. I love being able to add grilled onions and saut√©ed mushrooms as a free topping. Yummy."}
{"text":"Always love a good hamburger.   Nothing fancy just great execution.   

Been here a few times and every time I have a great meal.   I don't eat fast food often but when I want a burger its either here or In n Out.   I love the simplicity and the great taste.  I usually order a little hamburger.  Don't let the name full you as this is a regular burger and not small by any means.  If you order the regular size it is a lot of food FYI.  Also for the fries.  A small is also more than enough as I usually spilt those and we still end up with fries left over. My very first visit I made the mistake of ordering my own and didn't even make a dent. 

The Cajun fries are good and I love how it's something different than just regular fries.  But whatever you decide to get take you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"When I ate meat I loved this place. It wasn't anything spectacular but it was good enough for me to pay the lil pricey price. But I think it would be neat if they added a veggie burger option."}
{"text":"Supposed to open at 10 AM, 7 days a week... just drove miles here to get a burger and they are closed. Not sure if someone slept in or what but that's pretty unprofessional. You could see inside not a single person there, all the lights off, and clearly some stuff that needed to be prepped from the night before. Wtf?"}
{"text":"Awesome food! First thing I did my first time was grab some free peanuts and they were good. All the ingredients are free on your burger. Small piece of advice if it's your first time coming here don't get the large fries. They load the small fries with enough for 2 ppl"}
{"text":"I stopped at Five Guys Burger and Fries afterwards for a late lunch.  This chain has locations that are popping up and I haven't tried one before.

When you walk in, you can help yourself to some peanuts.

I ordered a burger, small fries and a pop.  When I opened the bag, all I could see was fries.  The burger was good and I'd get one again. Though the fries were good, there were way too many for a small size (and I didn't eat them all) and my focus was on the burger.  Had I known it was a double burger, I wouldn't have ordered the fries.  If you order fries, split them with a friend unless you are really really hungry."}
{"text":"How can you not like Five Guys. Great hamburgers. Great fries. Grilled hot dogs. The new Coke machines that allow you to mix your Cokes how you want them. Oh, and you can't forget the free peanuts. Every Five Guys I have eaten at is the same...great."}
{"text":"I used to get excited every time I flew to Washington DC because I got to have a Five Guys burger. Now they are all over the country. At first I was concerned that the expansion would hurt the quality. It hasn't. It is still one of the best hamburgers that you can get, great fries and one of the best hot dogs too."}
{"text":"Fries were soggy/undercooked. Burger just so/so.  Had the A-1 cheeseburger w onions and shrooms."}
{"text":"This is a clean, excellent example of a five guys. Consistent, fast service and professional team every time I've gone. Food is consistent with their chain. Love the free peanuts while you wait. :)"}
{"text":"The Burgers are AWESOME! I had the little bacon cheeseburger and it was one of the best burgers I've had in awhile. I love In and Out, but Five Guys was better. Cajun fries were good and loved the peanuts while waiting in line. They may have needed to have a bigger space, or it may be fine once they open their other locations, that was the only thing limited parking and waiting for table, neither was drastically long,but my husband isn't into waiting (he didn't mind once he got the food)
YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"B-b-b-bump!  I've been here a couple more times since my initial review, and they have improved in many ways.  I feel that the burgers are juicier than before, and all the toppings seem incredibly fresh for a fast food place.  The music has been toned down probably by a factor of 5.  NO MORE YELLING AT THE PERSON SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU!!  

And the fries...I was not a fan of the fries initially.  But on my recent visit I noticed that they had a whiteboard that listed where today's potatoes came from.  I can't remember where they came from, but they were delicious!  Nice golden color with a crispy-ish outside and soft inside.    So perhaps the fry quality depends on their origin.  And this time they were lightly dusted with the Cajun seasoning, not caked in it.

Five Guys is relatively new to Vegas, so perhaps their QC is still combing through each location.  This location now seems to be up to par, and is now a reliable option for those times where I just need to have a burger."}
{"text":"I really love Five Guys as a whole but it pains me to say that I am just not a fan of this location in particular. The location is convenient, being right by Chandler Mall, but the fries, why oh why do they scrimp on the fries. I usually frequent the Five Guys on Ray Rd but went to this location since it was by the mall. Feeling pretty hungry, my husband and I got our usual burger orders and a large order of cajun fries to share and pouring it out into the bag, realized the amount of fries equaled a medium/regular that we would get at other locations. Considering that sizing up cost us an extra $1.75, it was pretty/really disappointing. Not to mention, I had already psyched myself up on stuffing my face with cajun fries. Don't even get me started on the lack of cajun seasoning. And to be fair, this isn't the first time this happened, so I can't even lump it under the \"maybe it was an off day\" excuse."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side for a fast food joint, but so, so worth it.  I always get the Lil Hamburger or Lil Cheeseburger and I always have so many toppings on it I feel bad for the guy putting my burger together cause, man, trying to balance all that on this burger could not have been easy.  You have my utmost respect, kind sir.  And now you would ask, why don't I just order a regular Hamburger/Cheeseburger that has two patties instead of one?  The fries.  Specifically, those cajun fries.  Every time I order a large, I stuff my face and swear to myself that I'm ordering a regular next time.  Never happens.  And it's not like there aren't enough fries in the regular (they fill a water cup then add another scoop of fries in the bag), there are way too many fries for me, but I'm greedy.  This is why I'm never gonna get abs.  That and that thing called exercising.  It's a foreign concept."}
{"text":"I was one of those jerks who was on my phone while they were politely trying to take my order so I didn't realize when the cashier accidentally charged me for a LARGE fry rather than a LITTLE fry. Completely my fault cause I didn't even look up from my phone for a second when he was placing my order. When I got my fries I realized they had given me and charged me a large, I love five guys but definitely didn't need a large order of fries. They had a manger come back and refund me my money. Great customer service, from the moment I walked in I was greeted by everyone who was in the front of the house! Like I said, the mistake was my fault & they were still so great about it!!! Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Five Guys, gets 4 stars!
i've seen these all over the place, but one just opened up here in Etobicoke.
The fresh shelled peanuts are a nice touch while waiting.

It is a pretty simple burger system, and you choose what condiments from the board. You can see all of the action happen, adding to the freshness! Not too long of a wait, they have a pretty quick system there.

The burger is a great size, and you can taste how real it is. It is so hard to go to McDonalds after eating at Five Guys."}
{"text":"Food: AWESOME! Caution: the jalape√±os are pretty darn spicy. Bacon cheeseburger 10/10! They have the touch screen coke machines which I love as well.

Speed: 4/5
Not terrible considering they were decently busy but I got ignored when I went to ask for a cup of water by one employee and had to wait for a different one. 

Environment: 5/5 Very clean and welcoming.

Friendliness of employees: 3/5 this is where it gets a little sticky. 2 out of the 4 employees working out front were great. Specifically the two younger men working the grill and the burger making stations - they were awesome. The older male and female employees were a bit rude. They had an altercation between each other out front where customers could hear...just take it to the back next time. I could tell there was something weird going on and it reflected in their service. 

Overall 4/5 and will go back. Just fix your attitudes next time and lead by example. :/"}
{"text":"big, fat, and dirty  
if cheeseburgers were hookers 
yes; happy ending.

Sometimes you just need it. A big, greasy, no holds barred cardiac killer meal. Not a glammy designer burger, not a lowfat turkey burger, not a silly tofu burger in sight here. Just meat and potatoes. And peanuts to keep you busy while you wait for the guys to cook your burger to order. Be prepared for a 10-15 minute wait as everything really _is_ cooked to order. 
A \"small\" order of fries feeds a family. 
A regular sized burger has 2 patties of beef oozing beefy, fatty goodness.
 
Do not order this burger \"to-go\" and try to eat it in your car. 
-Your pants will look like you encountered the legendary \"Whore of the Lido Lounge\" and she gave you a lap dance. 
The hot dogs on the menu kinda disappoint.
There are 18 fryer baskets in this location.  Yowza! -One notices these things while waiting...

Just figure that a meal here will take a week off of your lifespan. 
-So what.
 Who the hell wants those last 10 years anyway. 

Carry on."}
{"text":"So I suppose I made the mistake of ordering the smaller burger.... Didn't know the difference.... But now I do. Regular burgers have 2 patties vs 1,and man does it make a big difference.  Makes for ooey gooey good cheesiness. Its still a messy burger and I still don't like their buns but now I can give it 3 stars. Would be better if they would toast their buns! Hahaha."}
{"text":"After a few visits Im not really a fan, For what you get everything is overpriced. I've had several burgers at regular sit down restaurants near by that taste much better and the same cost. I really don't know how they stay in business."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see a 5 Guys in Phoenix.  I love their burgers and this place is just as good as the ones on the east coast.  The burgers are cooked fresh when you order them. the burger is juicy, the bacon is crispy  and the cheese melty. Delish.  You can choose from a wide selection of toppings at no additional cost.  
I always get the small bacon cheeseburger and a drink. No fries.  All 5 guys fries are limp. I like my fries crunchy.  If they changed their fries I would up them to a 5 star rating.  For those that like a juicy burger reminescent  of what you make at home, with toppings customized to fit your appetite for the day 5 Guys is it."}
{"text":"You know your hipster friend where it turns out he has Linkin Park on his iPhone, and the next thing you know, he's \"rocking out\" to Neil Diamond unironically?

Yeah. He eats at this Five Guys.

If there weren't a ton of signs telling me that these burgers are better than fast food, I wouldn't have known. While the fries and the bacon were both crisp (huge plus), the fries were so salt-encrusted that I couldn't finish them, and the burger itself tasted only of salt and its chosen toppings. Even the possibilities of raspberry Fanta Zero don't staunch my regret that I didn't instead go to Old Town and spend the same money on a far superior burger at David's -- or stop at Wendy's on the way home and come out par for half the price.

Add the ear-splittingly loud soundtrack of Lite Hits of the Seventies, and I'm bearing grudges here."}
{"text":"Trust me, I'm an American.... Five Guys is the best burger experience anywhere, even Liverpool! I stopped in to have a bacon cheeseburger and a banana shake, just what I order when I go to my local Five Guys in the States. The Liverpool store serves with the same, if not a tad better, quality than back home. What a delight to have a taste of home after being away. Don't bother with the Golden Arches or the King Of Burger... go to Five Guys and get a proper meal."}
{"text":"Five Guys opened on Mill today in the old Coffee Plantation location.  The place was bright, loud and busy. I was immediately impressed with how many people they had working; I counted 14 just behind the counter. They had classic rock playing so loud you could barely hear them call out order numbers and the people behind the counter were yelling and laughing. It's a pretty fun experience for lunch.

I ordered the little bacon cheeseburger, cajun fries and regular drink. The burger was decent (not In and Out quality, but pretty good). I really liked that they let you load up on your choice of toppings (I got grilled onions, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato and pickles) they also had green peppers, jalapeno peppers, bbq and A1 sauce. I was a little disappointed with the price as $10.24 seemed a bit high. 

They didn't have shakes  which was a major let down. All in all it was pretty good, but not much better than Fat Burger which is just down the block on Mill. I'll be interested to see how they far in the long run."}
{"text":"Being from the West Coast it has been difficult to find a burger place that tops In-n-Out Burger ... Five Guys comes pretty close making your burger just the way you want it, essentially the perfect burger with fresh fries to go with.  If you are going to order fries, order the small ... they put your fries in a small cup but then they pack your bag with fries as well.  
Wished they offered shakes here, but not too disappointed as there is a Coldstone next door."}
{"text":"It was a long wait, but Five Guys is finally open in Mission. Best fries in the industry,  massive beautiful burgers,  fast and very, very friendly service. And it's inner city. No more having to head to the soul destroying suburbs. Lots of seating and in my three visits there so far no huge lineups."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people actually go to this place and actually enjoy it. $15 for just two burgers?! That doesn't include the fries and drink. Way overpriced and the burgers weren't even good. They were bland in my opinion. Five guys is over hyped and the pictures look way better than it actually tastes don't be fooled! Gave it 2 stars because the staff was nice and the fries were good. (The only thing good though)"}
{"text":"The insane/unintelligent people giving this place 1 star have no idea what they're talking about. This place is amazing, the service is good, and the food is perfectly done. 

If you don't like it, go enjoy your shitty In n Out. It just means more for those of us who have functioning taste buds.

Also: Not giving a military discount is not a reason to rate a restaurant down. Talk about entitlement..."}
{"text":"Just went here again, today. I don't know what the hell these crazy people who are writing reviews are talking about, but the fries aren't \"undercooked\". Perhaps that's because you're actually tasting potato in them...

Screw the haters... If you don't like Five Guys, then stay the hell out, so I can get my food faster. Enjoy your cardboard-tasting In n Out, while I enjoy a REAL burger."}
{"text":"As I read in another review - I am shocked this place does not have more 5 star reviews.  Granted the cost is a touch on the high side, the food more than makes up for it!

The burgers have a wonderful flavor with a hand pattied look (they probably aren't). Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked... the first burger addicted me!

The french fries have a great flavor.... In-N-Out on steriods....  I am craving them just thinking about them.

Soda machine.... wow.  Every flavor you can imagine added to the usual Coke products.

Free peanuts?  Where can you go wrong?!?

I love Five Guys... actually ate here two days in a row last week!  Will be back a few times!"}
{"text":"I've been to Five Guys twice, each time for lunch.  This first time, I chose the veggie burger.  Big mistake.  There was no burger.  Just their veggie toppings piled onto bun.  I wish there had been more information either on the menu or from the guy taking my order.  To be fair, I think it was his first day.  Good news, an order of fries is HUGE. Plan on sharing.  I ordered a regular hamburger on my second trip, and it was fine. Nothing to write home about, especially considering that I had heard a lot of comparisons to In & Out.  Overall, I might go back once in a while."}
{"text":"Meh. This location was a bit of a disappointment as I've enjoyed other Five Guys burgers out East in the Pittsburgh area. I like a little grease but both the burger and fries were too oily. Service was just okay. For the premium price charged here the food quality isn't up to par."}
{"text":"Been to them out of the state many, many times and always loved them.  Quick, simple, delicious... with awesome portions.  All the toppings are free and you can get whatever you want on your burger... no limit.  When I saw they put one in close to home I had to revisit because it had been years, and I was not disappointed.  It was better than I remembered (which is probably because it had been so long).  Double burger with bacon, jalape√±os, and cheese... simple and amazing.  The burgers come wrapped in foil and when you open that little shell on the inside is a melty, hot, delicious burger that will make your mouth sing.  You have to check this place out I'd you want a legit burger."}
{"text":"Great bacon cheeseburger and awesome fries.  Very generous portion on fries. Clean and friendly, will be back."}
{"text":"I always have quality food when I come here but multiple times I make my order online or call ahead and am waiting 20-30 min for my food AFTER I arrive. The customer service at this location is a 1, but I was gracious in giving a 3, because I love burgers. This location has the ability to be amazing if they got a new staff. Makes me not to want to ever return."}
{"text":"Food was average. I would have gave it 5 stars but the mouse that ran past me running into the front of store kinda ruined it."}
{"text":"I'm a huge burger and fries junkie and this place by far has been the tastiest I have had out here in Phoenix. Soft bun, flavorful patty, your choice of toppings, and a ton of fries that taste great. Will definitely be going back to this place."}
{"text":"As far as burger joints go, this place is definitely a favourite. They don't have a unique sauce like In-n-Out, but their burgers feel hand-formed, and the meat is of top-notch quality. Definitely try their fries."}
{"text":"Went in after 6pm for a dinner burger, they took FOREVER. All the employees were messing around and not paying attention to orders. I ordered a little bacon cheeseburger, simple enough...I get home, NO BACON on my little burger, ugh. So annoying! I paid for it! Damn it, where is my bacon?"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I am writhing this, but Five Guys is better than In-N-Out... waiting for lighting bolt to hit me. Ok, no bolt, so more review. I was visiting Phoenix for work and saw that there was a Five Guys a couple blocks away, I decided to try it. 

Simple menu, good prices, and delicious burger (which can come with a laundry list of options as toppers -- all free). The Cajun fries were also amazing. The only fault that I could find is that they do not serve shakes -- whoever heard of a place with burgers and fries but no shakes. Seems like something that should be reported to the burger authorities. 

A couple opened up in Southern California so look out In-N-Out -- you are not the only burger on the block."}
{"text":"Just like all the rest. The exception was an employee made me two versions of fry sauce, common in Utah locations. Moreover, they liked my tie more than my boss'. I thought that was funny."}
{"text":"This Five Guys was significantly better than the one near my house in California. I got the little cheeseburger \"all the way\" or something like that. I forget the actual language. Anyway, it was tasty! We also got both the cajun and regular fries, and I have to say that the cajun fries are where it's at."}
{"text":"\"No. I don't want 5 guys. 5 guys are the guys who can't get no love from me. Servin' up some ok fries, but the price sky high.. ya won't hear no hollerin' from me!\" 
Between the sloppy staff, the hard to swallow prices, and the OMITTANCE OF CHEESE, which made my bacon burger even HARDER to swallow, this Five Guys location gets a whopping 2 stars. That being said, I think I would have been happier with a Whopper. The only redemption to this meal, which was had on really ugly tables, and super uncomfortable seats, was the glut of french fries. I allegedly had a hot dog too, but it was obviously quite forgettable, because the only detail I really remember from the hot dog was explaining to the broad who took my order that \"everything on a hot dog *doesn't mean lettuce...\" 
I'll go satisfy my appetite with something spectacular....... elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly service! Such a neat place. Super affordable, cool soda machine, and peanuts while you wait!! Can't wait to visit again. The manager was in the store and was super friendly."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this chain in many towns and this was my first time here. It is as good or better than the others. As usual everything is fresh and made to order right in front of your eyes. The small burger is plenty for me and I love that I can say extra onions and peppers and that is what I get. The fries are always hot, fresh and plentiful. 
I ordered the hot dog with lots of toppings. It was cut lengthwise and cooked on the flattop. It was perfectly hot and had everything I ordered, perfect to the start of the summer.
I like that you can have all the topping you want without a weird look.
I got their phone number so next time I can call ahead and have it ready for take out"}
{"text":"Five Guys has the best fast food burgers around.  They are well-done yet still very moist and you can add as many toppings as you want free of charge.  With all of the toppings they have you can basically get a different burger every visit.  The also have fresh cut French fries from Idaho potatoes.  You can get them regular or Cajun style with spices on them.  If you enjoy fries and like food that has a kick make sure to try the Cajun style.  Overall, Five Guys has all of the burger options you could ever want.  I recommend it to anyone who likes traditional fast food!"}
{"text":"yummy!! old school and keep it simple with a basic menu. peanuts?? ok why not!! cajun fries are a must, dirt cheap and heaping with value and flavor, got the regular size fries, and still had alot left to take home for laters. we will definitely be back. professional service in a clean atmosphere, with better than basic food. thank u 5 guy's!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better review.  Although the workers were quite friendly, both orders that we made were messed up.  Don't get me wrong, though, the place does look fairly nice, and there is outdoor seating.  Better luck next time?"}
{"text":"Man i gave this place a couple chances to get it right before reviewing again since my last great experience, but its been like bad time after time the last couple times i came through.

Everything went down hill, there was no salt on the burgers or fries.

I love jalapenos on my burger and they forgot to put them today, and im not the type to go back and ask, i save my crying for yelp.

I dont blame the staff at all, the guy putting out the orders was multitasking hardcore, but i think if they had some more staff around lunch time they could get back to where they used to be.

FYI, never tried any other locations besides here and the states, so maybe this is a one off location, because i loved it in NY"}
{"text":"All the Five Guys just raised all their prices, so I'm sad about that.
However, the workers are very nice. The food is decent for what it is. I tried the burgers, hot dogs, and the fries here. All decent. When you order fries, they are very generous with the amount they give."}
{"text":"This place sucks. It's overpriced and a simple cheese burger cost 7 bucks!  I ordered a large fries for my bros and they were so salty to the point that they were inedible. Next time, I'm definitely going to Chipotle, which you should to. Overall, I was deeply unsatisfied and they were overhyped.  This specific 5 Guys was a let down."}
{"text":"If you want good burger - can't get any better at any price. This location like most has a great staff that normally you don't comment on regarding a fast casual but these guys were engaged, witty and offered great service. The burger (small bacon cheeseburger with mayo-lettuce- raw onion- fresh jalape√±o or the Jim as I call it) is great. Fresh, hot, juicy and done on a great bun. I ask for my Frys a little well done and they crisp them up which is another plus in the service category. Then the staff wonders the the joint asking how things are and offering refills and such. Don't they know this is a QSR concept and they are not obligated?  Go - get your great burger fix and send me thanks. Of they ever add TVs so I can catch my sports they might get a six."}
{"text":"I love the online ordering. Makes it easy to get a quick meal when I'm always on the run. Not only is their service fantastic but their food is amazing. Whenever I need a burger fix I will order up a burger from here!! Definitely my go to! Keep it up guys"}
{"text":"Good food, I like that you can pick as many toppings as you want. The burgers are juicy and the fries are great."}
{"text":"High marks for service and speed, low marks for being expensive and poor execution..$7 JR BACON CHEESEBURGER- $7!  And one little piece of bacon.  Paid for bacon it would be nice if some showed up on my burger."}
{"text":"Honestly it's ridiculous that the hours changed. I was at this location on Friday 2/2/18 at 10:45 AM and there was NO SIGN ANYWHERE that they were changing their hours. I went to go get lunch for 7 people today and they were closed. I now have to rearrange my entire plan. Very poor planning. Will not be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is kind of dirty, the service is ridiculously slow, and the food is not good. You're better off going to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Went here for the First time ever and Honestly I wasn't impressed. I paid wayyy tooo much for over priced no good frys. Had to throw most of them away. The burger was ok but way over priced too. Dont think I will ever go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  We've been to one in Florida, which was our first experience, and then a few here in the valley.   Fantastic food and the music selection filling the restaurant is great!"}
{"text":"You have to laugh every time you come here over the fact they put a Five Guys next to a Healthy Home Market. 

Five Guys is my guilty pleasure when I want a quick burger. I usually skip getting fries and instead opt for a grilled cheese on the side. I mean, if I'm going to be bad, why not just go all out. If you're in a big rush, get online or on their app and place your order ahead of time. If you've never been to a Five Guys, don't get carried away with the toppings or else your burger may become impossible to eat. 

This location is really clean and the workers are always in a good mood. Shout out to the guy on the grill during my last visit who gave me some kitchen gloves so I could cut jalapenos at home the next day. You da real MVP."}
{"text":"I have eaten at two locations and they are good burgers if they are close by, but not worth hunting for"}
{"text":"How in the world does this place not have at least 4 stars. I have yet to find a better tasting burger in the valley. Yes it's a little expensive $25 for two people, but it's great to go every once in a while. Every order is to-go. They give you a drink cup full of frys and drastically overflow your cup so that the whole bottom of the bag is basically frys. A little greasy, buy delicious if you like a little grease in your food. In-N-Out is walking distance from my house, but when I have a burger craving I always go to five guys.

Get Cajun seasoning on the frys
Toppings are free
Soooo many frys! :D
Mmmm..

Go get a burger already!"}
{"text":"'Five Guys' has been 'hit or miss' for me lately.  At times, i'm in juicy tasty 'burger heaven'.  But at other times, their burgers taste lesser and different, and i've even bit into bone and gristle (disgusting)!  Is the quality of their meat consistent?  I'm not so sure."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good burger place, that COULD be a great burger place. It has the potential. This is a chain that I actually first ate at while in Florida. I didn't even know they had made their way to Canada, but we were excited to see it and turned the car around to see how things went here in Canada.

The burgers are good, very large and filling and I like the grilled mushrooms as a topping. Where they fall short: no specialty sauces (just basic mayo) and no combos! This I find very strange. You have to order everything separately. It seems like a little thing to make a combo!

I liked the service though. The woman taking our order told me that only one fry would work or two people and she was right. I appreciated the heads up! But I wish they had some more variety of products.

I'm comparing it to the obvious one: Hero Burger and I guess what I'm saying is, Hero Burger wins! 

BUT if you want a good, basic burger, this is a good choice.

PS - Open containers of peanuts are both kind of gross AND bad for people with allergies. They seem like an unnecessary gimmick."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is incredibly friendly and the food is great! The burgers are amazing, but the fries are what I come for. I love sitting outside at this location, though the inside is nice too. This place is amazing all around, affordable and they turn out food really fast. I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. But I didn't. We have 5guys in Ohio, but I never went. I heard my friends rave about it, so when I passed one the other day I decided I had better give them a shot!

I ordered a grilled cheese, a veggie burger, a little bacon burger, a burger with everything on it and cajun fries to share with my friend. We wanted to try everything so we could give it a good shot. 

The fries were SO gross I couldn't even eat them. They had way too much seasoning.

The grilled cheese was interesting as it wasn't regular bread, it was a bun inside out. It was edible. 

The veggie burger was a WTF moment when i opened the casing. They dont have a veggie pattie. It is cheese and whatever veggies you picked while ordering. It basically looked like a mess when I opened it. The cheese was all over the wrapper. i couldnt believe they served something that looked like it had been  yesterdays meal. Gross.

The little bacon burger did not have bacon. Odd. Maybe it is similar to the veggie burger without a patty, you need to pretend it has it on there while you eat it to get the full effect. 

The regular cheese burger was fine. Overall, If we had just gotten this I think four stars would be doable. It didnt have a ton of taste, but it was better than fast food. 

They dont have salads. What type of place offers NO healthy options. You think the veggie burger will be somewhat decent for you, but it is prob worse than a burger there. 

Service was good. The place was clean. I didnt die after eating there. They have good tea. 

Cost: 27 dollars for two people. 

I feel bad giving this place two stars, but it totally doesnt deserve 3. Go to in-out burger and save 10 bucks."}
{"text":"The burgers are very fattening and honestly they aren't the best burgers I've had.  The toppings are lacking and for what you get I find it's pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Wow this place was extremely disappointing for a $5 burger I definitely expected more quality less greasiness and better taste. The burger was bland and unbeliveable greasy..ugh!... and  the fries were soggy but looked to golden which only tells me they haven't changed their oil recently :/ . On top of everything else the girl who took my order was more interested in what kind of phone I had and what my tattoo meant than what I wanted on my burger which resulted in them getting my order wrong. As for the other 10 people that were working at the time, they were just standing around talking and being way too loud. Not even the loud music they had playing could drowned them out. I'm sorry for all you people who actually like this place, but honestly I would take in-n-out over this place any day at least there's some flavor to their burgers and they can cook their fries a lot better."}
{"text":"meh, burger patties are thin so depending on the cook, they tend to dry out.  They do have a good \"grill flavor\" though.  But maybe I'm being too critical, it is after all a fast food burger chain, thus my 4 star rating when compared to the normal burger fast food chains (McDonalds, Burger King, Wendy's, etc) The option of adding any topping you want still won't cover up the disappointing meat patty.  I've had way better burgers but then again, they were not from a fast food burger chain.

Their saving grace is the fries, thick cut, soft inside with a crunchy exterior skin, They fill it up to the top and then add another half cup to top it off, gimmicky but effective

Would I go back, definitely as I know what to expect"}
{"text":"I love this place for it's simplicity. They have burgers, fries and dogs, that is it. Too many fast food places expand their menus into a quagmire of mediocrity. Not these guys, for a chain, they do what they know and they don't screw with it. 

Now, don't expect In-N-Out when you walk in, you have quite a few options as far as what you can get on the burger, and you don't need to know any of that secret menu stuff. So go nuts, but avoid the jalapenos, you'll not taste the burger, just the peppers. 

If you want my advice, the burger is great, and it's not healthy, so don't screw around and just get the bacon cheeseburger, \"All the way\". And unless you're training to take over for the \"Man vs. Food\" guy, stick to the regular fries, the large is huge!"}
{"text":"I stopped into five guys for the first time today cause I was starved. I got a hot dog and cheeseburger, the $20 cost seemed pricy but I figured \"oh well\". Being overwhelmed with menus I simply told the cashier I want both \"all the way\". She stared at me like I had 3 heads and asked which toppings I wanted. I said\" just everything, I'm not picky. Whatever comes on them\" she rolled her eyes, I got my number and sat down. I heard her speaking to two coworkers about me being a bitch, so I turned around and made direct eye contact hoping it would stop. I mean, come on, I came for food not a drama party. Then the talking  continued but in Spanish, which I speak fluently and it got worse and worse. Honestly there is no way in hades I was such a bitch that I deserved that treatment. I had spent the past month in a hospital and was starved for real food. I smiled graciously when my Number was called yet felt rushed out. Long story short, I won't go back. Food was great, treatment was sub par"}
{"text":"I can't understand why my hubby likes this place so much. I think they're pricey, and their burgers are just alright; the fries are barely crispy. But, the service has always been friendly. I would prefer to stick to In -n-Out or even Carl's Jr. when I'm in the mood for a tasty burger meal."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday around lunch time. Expected it to be busy but it was not. Yay! But that is where my Yay ends. Ordered cheeseburger well done. Got my burger & it was really big but also very messy & hard to eat. The meat the buns the toppings were just thrown together without a care. It was hard to grab as the meat & buns were sliding making it impossible to get a good bite. My first bite...all bread .second bite...all bread.. Then finally a bite of the meat &...wait for it.... It was NOT well done with too much pink for my taste. So upset & disappointed that my request was not given importance. Sadly I was out of time & could not get a new one & this one hit the trash. 
The dining room was small & made even smaller bc they had pallets of something blocking 1/4 of the room making so seats unavailable. Most of the remaining tables were dirty & in my time there no one came out to wipe them. As a matter of fact, I had to wipe my own table. That said, not worth coming here when you pay $7+ per burger alone( much higher if you add fries & drink) & not get a clean space or food the way you ordered it.  Yep, this place is off my list- will not return."}

Try saying that three times really fast. It just rolls of the tongue.

 I have always admired this place since my days in Florida. Honestly the only thing that I would change is the noise level. 

The burgers are cooked in 100% pure peanut oil. The ground beef taste fresh as well. 

They have a plethora of peanuts in multiple places. At the entrance and near the cashier looks like they have stacks and stacks everywhere, plus they are free.

Over all the burger was very good.

{"text":"Wow simplement wow...

Depuis que j'avais vu la vid√©o sur you tube de \"Dayum\", l'envie de manger du five guys est devenue une obsession. Dans la chanson, un gars chante comment il aime le five guys, apr√®s y avoir go√ªt√©, je suis 100% d'accord avec chaqun des faits. 

J'adore de ce qui est simple et pr√©cis, c√¥t√© d√©coration, je ne peux pas demander mieux. L'endroit est blanc et peu rouge...oui c'est tout. Les murs sont couverts de critique sur la cha√Æne. Il n'y a pas beaucoup de choix diff√©rents, burger/cheeburger. Ce qui fait la diff√©rence est dans les choix de condiments (la sauce piquante est tr√®s go√ªteuse et peu √©pic√©e...quasi-parfaite) on a plusieurs choix de toppings mais on est quand m√™me tr√®s loin des choix du Cheeburger Cheeburger (R.I.P. Bro). 

La viande est savoureuse et juteuse. L'hamburger est lourd et tombe partout sauf dans votre estomac , √† la premi√®re bouch√©e. La viande est fra√Æche. Les frites comment dire...je vais citer un extrait de la chanson : \"You bite the fries, the fries bite back my man, Dayum!\""}
{"text":"Now this is as close to homemade as burgers and fries can get.  They are very good, meaty, juicy and bread is grilled and flattened out some, so it's not so 'bready'.  The fries are very good and not too hard and crunchy.  And yes, there's some 'grease'.  But that's how good burgers are traditionally made - fried on a grill with some oil.  This is why you only eat this occasionally.  If you don't want any grease, then don't eat burgers and fries.  Love that they have Kosher hot dogs.  Will have to try that next.  Oh, and I agree that this is best eaten on-site, rather than taking it home so that it stays hot and fresh and doesn't have a chance to get soggy in the foil wrap."}
{"text":"Another place run by a bunch of clowns- Burgers and fries always SOLID but staff has no customer service skills- they mess up our orders, and yet no apology just smug indifference... a sign of the times for sure-  Don't  expect much in staff quality, best have the A.I. replace the mundane tasks here ... and allow the staff to do jobs they prefer.

Service integrity is hard to find these days!!"}
{"text":"This location is pretty meh. The workers are somewhat distracted which gets irritating when you're trying to order, but the food is on par with what it should be."}
{"text":"Nice and Juicy 

I am a huge fan of five guys burgers and fries. I always get the little cheeseburger and split a regular fry with my husband because they give you so many. I love the fact that you can choose what you want on your burger without having to special order. The grilled onions and mushrooms are awesome! Also they use real mayo rather than miracle whip which is a huge party bonus for me. The bacon is very good too.

I am not the biggest fan of the Cajun fries because they pack a little to much heat but the originals are pretty good and you get a ton. I also think it is really cool that they tell you were they got the potatoes they are making the fries from on the board when you walk in. 

The place is also really fun. It has a very high energy staff and has good music. Sometimes it can get a little loud so I would not recommend bringing anyone of sensitive hearing.  

Another cool thing that Five Guys does is gives you peanuts while you wait on your food. I like this because if you are super hungry or bored it gives you something to do or snack on while you wait."}
{"text":"Great food and I love the cajan fries!!! Service was great and finding a coke was crazy with the selection. Only bad thing here is you'll spend a lot. Its way over priced. 34.00 for a two drinks 3 burgers and 1 fry's.  They need to lower the prices. All around great place. Place was clean and service was great."}
{"text":"Five guys is always good. Very consistent and never disappoints. Had the bacon cheeseburger in a lettuce wrap and it was yummy.  Fries are the best around"}
{"text":"Burgers are fresh, handmade, no fillers, or preservatives!! Pick your own toppings!!
Fries excellent and local!! Friendly service and shakes good too!! Suggest you try it!! Better than A&W and McDonald's"}
{"text":"I popped my 5G cherry on a recent business trip to Washington so going in to the very busy down town location I knew what to expect. I also figured most chains that cross the borders are inconsistent so I lowered my expectations just in case. 

My other half hadn't heard of 5 Guys until I sent him the hilarious video of a gentleman doing a review of 5 G from his car. With his review being nothing more than \"OH MY DAMN\" in the back of our minds we took a chance on grabbing some grub before heading to a movie down the street. 

As I previously mentioned I was anticipating a terrible experience and the boyf was losing his MIND with anticipation. 

We walk in and get hit by the blinding lights and almost too sterile retro decoration. The place was busy but we didn't wait at all to place our order. 

The girl at the counter was kind enough to explain how it worked to the boyf and then we ordered. He got a double burger (large?) with bacon and cheese. I got a small (single?) with a plethora of toppings. Including my absolute favourite grilled mushrooms!!

We grabbed a table and filled our cups and waited for our number to be called. I think we waited about 10 minutes for our order which then came in the classic brown bag stained with grease from the piles of fries they put in the bag. 

You're probably wondering how my meal was given my lowered expectations....

Dare I say that it was better than when I got 5G in the States!! It was perfectly topped and completely delicious. 

We didn't grab any of the free peanuts they have by the condiments because we were saving room for our feast, but that's an option if you're starving and want a bit of a snack. 

2 burgers, a large fries and 2 fountain pops came to $30. It's a bit steep for 2 meals, of just burgers and fries if you ask me. 

Nevertheless it was pretty great. A nice occasional treat given the gluttony in which we partook. 

One more negative is that the bathrooms are in the basement.10 Dundas is a newer building so basement bathrooms are almost sacrilegious. 

Who am I kidding though, I'm hooked and as I write this am craving a burger from 5 Guys."}
{"text":"The owner commented on someone saying it was too loud, saying to let them know next time.

\"The next time you're in, remember to mention that the music is too loud and we can go ahead and turn it down slightly\"

*slightly*?!?!!   Dude you don't get it.   It is painfully unacceptably loud.  Some customers are miserable and your staff will get hearing damage.  85 decibels or more you lose hearing . . . not now, but in future.

This is like someone complaining about a flies and saying \"we will reduce the number of flies slightly\"."}
{"text":"This new Five Guys has very friendly staff but the cheeseburgers and fries were bland. We were there four lunch and I had a cheeseburger with barbecue sauce and mushrooms and you'd think that would be tasty but nope. They were out of pickle slices the day I was there so my daughter went without. The fries were large but had no flavor. They give a generous portion and We ate what we could and took the rest home. They were tastier heated up with some seasoned salt poured on. The music was great for me - 80's hard rock. I may give it another try in a month or so.

Update: I never eat two hamburgers in one day but this day I happen to have In and Out Burger that evening. What a difference! The In and Out was super tasty and .... They weren't out of pickles!"}
{"text":"A visit to any Five Guys never disappoints.  

I love their burger making concept and the atmosphere.  Ordering is easy as long as you know what you want.

A regular burger with lettuce, tomato, raw onions, jalapenos & some mayo makes a mouth watering experience for me.  Top that off with a refreshing Cherry Coke and you've got yourself a happy man.  Fries are on point and of course I love that they overload them into the paper bag.  One order of regular fries can feed 2 people no problem.  Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"The cashier  Juana looked annoyed when she was taking our order.  We had to get her attention that we were ready too order because she was too busy talking to one of the cooks.  There were 3 employees and 3 guest inside the restaurant and the place was very dirty.  We had to wipe our own table down.  First time there and probably our last."}
{"text":"The food was not quite on par with the other Five Guys location I have visited. I'm not sure if a cook was having an off day, but I've manage to muster a few complaints:  the burger was well done ; the fries were not crispy (not to mention that the portion was not as large as my previous visit); lastly, I ordered grilled onions and about a quarter of them were raw. Though, none of these were egregious mistakes for a fast food restaurant. On the positive side, I did indulge in a generous portion of the complimentary peanuts; it's hard to go wrong with those."}
{"text":"In n out is still way better. Five guys is too greasy. I hate eating a burger and having it drip down my arm. Also their fries are cooked in peanut oil which makes them cook darker and not as good. They also happen to have the same color scheme as In n out... Interesting since In n out came out 40 years before. Also they are not very \"green\" people that eat inside still get paper bags instead of trays. Are they implementing a recycling program? If so why don't they advertise that instead of all their stupid adds. Which is super stupid. Oh and I love the yelling during my meal. Makes me happy! (noT!) Ugh I don't think I'll eat here again."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys but this location gives the whole chain a bad name. First, girl taking the order screams for \"one party\" as loud as she can. I ordered a Diet Coke that tasted like nothing but syrup. Sodas were broken. Then came the burger. Wrong! Then witnessed them get the order wrong twice. Horrible. Such a small menu and can't get it right."}
{"text":"I'm sorry this place is no good in my opinion. This is only my second time trying it and I figured maybe my taste buds have changed but no it still not a place I would love to go. 

This time I ordered a veggie burger and it was horrible. No taste at all it was extremely bland! The French fries were super soggy and drenched in oil. Customer service is ok the cashier was friendly. However the cooks seem to have an attitude and are slow to serve up your food. 

If you love in and out please don't come here expecting something better you will be highly disappointed. Also they are much more expensive.  I  much rather wait at in n out than come here agai"}
{"text":"Holy let down batman. 

I totally got sucked into the \"Five Guys hype\": reading the owner's story about opening the restaurant with his kids:  how he doesn't spend much on the restaurants themselves, but instead focuses on the quality of the food:  How they don't deliver, that nothing is frozen, etc.  But above all how good their food is. 

Mr. Boss of all Five Guys franchises:  Please visit your restaurants.  

In and Out  = better than Five guys

Smashburger  = better than Five guys

Delux   = better than Five guys

Fat Burger  = better than Five guys



McDonalds  = better than Five guys


Perfect (twice fried) french fries?  Soggy mess.

Fresh ingredients?  I can't disprove this, but to cook said ingredients to death and then dress them up with \"as many condiments as I want\" ? No high five for you. It's like offering me fancy ketchup with my well-well done filet mignon. (though to be fair, most places cook everything to well done... it was just a mess here though)
 
And the kiss?  I paid 5 bucks for said tasteless krabby patty of woe.  I went in to the restaurant thinking:  

WOW ME 5 GUYS, FUCKING WOW ME.   

Thats all I wanted!  Give me a reason to come back!  I can't believe you formula for success is to bank on the masses having mediocre taste buds.  Can't say this isn't the right formula for success, but come-fucking-on!"}
{"text":"In general the food at Five Guys is pretty darn good. However I would recommend you check your food to make sure they got all the condiments you ordered on it. When they're busy they tend to forget a condiment or two. Other than that the place is clean and orderly. Good atmosphere good music."}
{"text":"This is another welcome addition to Bell Town Center, which has been adding some great new businesses in the past few months.
I had the little bacon burger which was perfect. Super crispy bacon. My husband had the Cheeseburger.double patties. He enjoyed it.
I loved the fries..if you are a crispy skinny fry kind of person, than forget coming here. They were thick, and a bit on the soggy side, which is just how I love them.
They have mello yello as a fountain drink option. Mello yello! take me back to 1986!
It was pricey..burgers, 1 medium drink, 1 large fry-$18 and change. 
the atmosphere was fun, and I didn't see the peanuts until we left, darn!
We'll be back."}
{"text":"So I tried this location today. I walk up to the cashier to order a hot dog 
She says they are out of hot buns and I laugh and say really? She says they didn't have any yesterday either but I could get it on a hamburger bun. Two days and no hot dog buns? Nobody could stop at grocery store on the way to work and buy buns? Lol"}
{"text":"These burgers are delicious - you need to pay this place a visit! They have no freezers at any Five Guys - only coolers, so the ground beef is always fresh - never frozen. Their simple, no-nonsense menu and decor reminds me a little bit of IN-N-OUT Burger, but the difference between them in taste is pretty obvious.

If you order what appears to be regular-size hamburger or cheeseburger, you will get two patties instead of one. For most people this is a little much, so try ordering the \"little\" version instead for a single patty.

My favorite here is a cheeseburger with ketchup, mustard, mayo and raw onions. The fries are good and a small order is more than enough to satisfy (half my bag was filled with fries in addition to the cup they placed into it with my burger).

Two things caught my attention at this burger joint that I found a little different. There are boxes of peanuts placed throughout the restaurant for you to scoop into little cardboard serving trays and snack on while you wait for your food. The other thing that caught my eye is the markerboard at the register that tells you where \"today's potatoes came from\" (on my visit they came from Kansas).

They have a loyal following here and get pretty busy, so you if you need to grab-n-go, you can visit their website and put your order in ahead of time.

UPDATE: If you drove out of your way to this location because it was the closest one, there is good news - a new Five Guys is now open in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"So I've recently become obsessed with North American-style burgers. I find it strange that even though you (North Americans) go crazy for toppings, nobody offers fried egg or beetroot as an option (like a good Aussie burger with The Lot has).

While Five Guys doesn't fill that gaping hole in the burger topping market they do have a lot of other toppings, and what they have is good. I particularly like the mushrooms they throw in there, and the fact that the cheeseburger with bacon comes with two patties of meat by default is another thing to love about it.

The fries here are also really good. A word of warning: a large serving is enough for 2-3 people, so share if you can (don't just fill up the cup with fries, but 1/2 the bag the cup is in). They're cooked in peanut oil, so they taste a bit different from other places - and there's lots of free peanuts to eat while you're waiting!

There isn't really anything else on the menu, and it's always busy;  both big pluses in my book. I like places which are good at what they do, and don't try to please everyone."}
{"text":"Love that they offer the option of veggies on a bun and their awesome fries.  It would be even better if they offered a decent vegan burger (not processed). Fast, friendly service.  This location wasn't as busy as others I have been to."}
{"text":"I really like 5 guys in general and I do stop by quite a bit on Mill Avenue. I took my friend TJ who is new to America and has never had a burger before, what a fun experience!  We walked in one night for dinner and ordered, I got the bacon cheese burger with everything on it, and he got the cheese burger. We waited probably 5 minutes for it and of course it was delicious! I began eating mine, eating peanuts and tossing them on the floor as my friend opened his and was disappointed they hadn't put any toppings on it. He walked up to the counter and asked if he could pay gthem to just throw some toppings on and instead they guy said \"next time just let us know you want toppings, have a seat and I'll have a new one made this time -free of charge!! 
I thought that was so cool of them, they didn't even know it was his first time but they sure made his first American burger experience epic! He loved it! And had lunch for the next day now! Thanks 5 guys for takin care of my buddy, that was really cool of you guys!"}
{"text":"We ate at five guys on Eastern tonight. It was fantastic Adrian our server is out of this world he's always positive and his friend Nick was great too thanks so much five guys."}
{"text":"My sister and I picked up lunch Saturday. We got 2 bacon double cheeseburgers and 1 large fry, the total was $20. The burger was worth every penny. They have a wide variety of toppings and the burger is made when you order it. 

The burger & fries were so filling that I skipped dinner that night and fell asleep shortly after I ate. I'll be back....not too soon though."}
{"text":"Average burger, average taste, above average prices. Anyone who thinks this is good food has no credibility when it comes to food. If you want cheap cheese, bland meat, and a lot of grease and want to pay too much this is the place. I go to Columbus OH for work, Graffiti burger is the place over there. They have a big sign over the Five Guys in Columbus. I passed by the Five Guys, almost empty, go to Graffiti, PACKED. There is a reason for that, they serve the best burgers around. I so wish AZ had a place like that. Until that happens, I am in search for the best burger in AZ."}
{"text":"The owners of this chain sure know how to hype up an average tasting burger. The food is not bad nor good, it is just average. Its food you can cook at home. The cheese is that cheap fake cheese, the meat sucks. The price is way too much. Im not a cheap guy, I like spending money on food if it is good, Five Guys simply is not that. Go to another burger place and save your money."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about five guys burgers and fries from several of my friends, but I never made the trek to the location on the mill ave. I figured I would get around to it one day, but didn't think it was worth it to drive 15 miles for a burger. Well, once the hollywood video went out of business and I saw that they were putting a five guys right next to where I work, I decided I had to go and see what all the fuss was about.

I decided that I would get the full experience on my first go, so I got a regular burger all the way (with all the toppings in black). The burger itself was very good, the veggies were crisp and fresh, and the patty juicy. The bread was a little squished, but I guess that's part of the charm (who said burgers are supposed to be pretty anyway? Smashburger I'm looking at you). 

I ordered the regular fries and my friend got the cajun. The fries were my least favorite part of the meal, they were too soggy. After getting some advice from a friend, I was told that the frys were soggy because I left them in the bag. Which makes sense, if you leave them in the bag they steam, and the steam condensates on the fries and makes them soggy. So on my next trip I ripped the bag open like a raging hulk and pulled out the cup, and alas, my fries were deliciously crispy! Problem solved. The cajun fries weren't anything to scream about, basically just fries covered in pepper. I would skip them and go for the regular fries. I don't know if the location here offers it, but the five guys in idaho falls has fry sauce, and there's nothing like fry sauce with a big bag full of fries (who doesn't like to mix ketchup with mayonnaise, it's amazing!) :-)

Overall, if I had my choice, I would get a five guys burger and in-n-out fries. That would be perfect. But overall, I think the burgers here are great, and I will be going back. And seeing as how there's always room for improvement, especially considering it's a burger shack that doesn't even offer milk shakes, 4 stars."}
{"text":"I had never been here so I thought I'd give it a shot the burgers are okay not the best and my main complaint is the music is way too loud and the cook yelling out orders is very rude and annoying not sure if I'll be back"}
{"text":"- poor quality greasy burger with mediocre toppings.
- grossly over-priced even by gourmet burger standards.
- definite stay away from."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night after hearing loads of great reviews. Definitely not disappointed. I had a \"little\" bacon cheeseburger. My fiance had the regular burger with grilled onions and mushrooms and all the rest of the works. Definitely a great burger for the price. Nice that all the toppings are free, compared to some other establishments where you have to pay extra for some of the more premium toppings. 

The fries - amazing! We tried both the regular and the cajun. Definitely some of the best fries we've ever had.

2 burgers, split 1 fry, and 2 drinks - almost $20. Okay so not the cheapest, but cheaper than eating at a restaurant and the burgers were pretty nice quality.

Okay all that being said, I wasn't ecstatic to hear how fattening this place was. And also, didn't feel too great afterwards.

Am I crazy to look past all that for the taste of the food? Sadly I think I am. Seriously...so worth it. Not an every day outing, but definitely a nice treat now and then. There's a reason they have been ranked better than In n Out and other places..."}
{"text":"I like Five Guys.  Liked them even better when I ate buns and red meat.  Now I still eat their fries.........because they are made in a dedicated fryer.  See there is no other item on the menu that they make in their fryers so I don't need to worry about being glutened there.

Awesome!  Oh, and said fries?  Done in peanut oil so they are beyond YUM!

They are also very good about doing a bunless burger for you with extra toppings if you cannot eat one.  I've had them bunned (before celiac dx), bunless (while still eating red meat) and none...........

The only bummer here is there are only burgers and fries and drinks on the menu.  No chicken sandwich.........so I cannot even order a bunless chicken.  That makes for only fries I can eat.  Luckily, my family can eat here and get me fries and I can run next door to Chipotle for a bowl and everyone is happy!

Oh, did I tell you that I mix mayo and catsup together for my fries?  Try it.  You'll love it or be grossed out by it.  Yeah."}
{"text":"Been to other Five Guys and loved it...but this was an epic fail.  Should have known when the guy in the grey t-shirt kept questioning the guy in the red t-shirt about when he was going to drop the fries.  Can anyone say raw potatoes here?  Worst fries I have ever had.  And it was obvious by looking at them that they were not done...SO SAD!

Burger and dog were OK but ruined by my disappointment...and not great service to boot.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Best fast burger ever! They do not have freezers here. Meat and fries are never frozen all cut fresh daily and you can truly taste the difference! Free toppings include grilled onions and mushrooms. 22 types of drinks available & free refills! Super high quality Hot dogs too if you're not in the mood for a burger! Love this place! Easy in and out too!"}
{"text":"I know its a burger place but try the hotdogs.

All items are grilled.  

Buns are fresh.

Tons of items to add to your burger/hotdog that are free.  FREE.  No charge.

Fries are awesome.  A sign tells you where the potatoes are from that day.  And they are not cheap with them.  One small is enough for two, sometimes three.

Fast and friendly service.

Somewhat loud, rock music playing, which makes the burger joint experience complete."}
{"text":"On occasion, only a big, fat, messy greasefest will do.  An evil greasefest of deliciousness.  I like a greasy burger.  Five Guys pretty much redefined the experience for me.  Ordered what I thought would be a good cheeseburger, and got this 2-patty behemoth with 2 slices of american cheese so greasy the top of the bun was shiny.  Add grilled onions and fries cooked in peanut oil, and my heart started waving a tiny white flag even whily my taste buds were doing their happy dance.  As I was fighting to keep my eyes open on the way home I think I heard my son say he just grew a new chin.

At about $10 a person, I only wish it weren't so expensive.  It is just a burger joint, after all.  But they gotta pay for the new building with Scottsdale Rd. frontage rent and seven (seven! like clowns in a car back there!) staff behind the counter somehow.  And it really is a killer burger.

Time for nap."}
{"text":"Did I spot two patties in my bacon cheeseburger with the works? Hard to say because it was so delicious, I barely took a second look before it was done. This place is great for a (not cheap) burger, fries, and drink. It all came to $17, which I'd say is worth it for the quality burger, friendly staff, and plenty of clean tables."}
{"text":"Five Guys in Montreal,

The famous burger franchise opened a location two blocks away from where I work, so today after waiting a few weeks for them to work out the kinks that you are bound to find in any new restaurants, I wondered over at lunch to give them a try.

I liked the look of the place typical old school fast food decor and hustle and bustle, the kind of feel you don't find at the big boys. In their desire to homogenize the look, feel and taste of their food, the fast food feel has gone away. What I liked about Five guys was the fact that are unapologetic about what they serve. It's burgers, fries and soft drinks, they aren't trying to be a salad bar or a coffee shop, it's a burger joint point!

The person taking my order at the cash was great fast efficient no fuss no muss, even if the line was out the door, she was a pro got my order right first shot and I didn't order an all-dressed I picked my toppings individually. What more can you ask for? 

As for the rest of the experience, I kind of have to agree with the previous reviewers. Although the burger tasted good I felt it had been thrown together, I ordered raw onions on my burger and none of them were on the patty, they were under the bread. I had the regular fries, they were OK but nothing spectacular, I prefer the fries at LaFleure but that's a matter of personal taste. 

In short if you're in the area it's not a bad place for a quick burger to go and the taste is pretty good but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place isn't getting higher ratings but I love five guys!

I usually get a bacon or the bacon cheeseburger with a side of Cajun fries (the fries are key). It's fully customizable with plenty of toppings and you get free peanuts while you wait. The burgers are always juicy and tender and the fries are very fresh. The Cajun fries is what makes me come back so often.

Overall it is a little on the expensive side with a burger plus friends costing more than $10 but I think everyone should indulge once in a while!"}
{"text":"The burgers are fresh to order. I love the soda machine and the different flavors it has."}
{"text":"Five guys is awesome. They are always pretty quick, and always accurate with the order. It's pricey, but you get a LOT of fries, and the burger has such a classic, old time, unique flavor combination, that you would be hard pressed to find a better burger. Worth the money."}
{"text":"I came in here wanting and expecting this place to be amazing.  I wanted this place to be 5 stars. ugh, I feel like a failure for giving it 2.  I've heard such good things about this place, and was expecting it to be good, but unfortunately, it was not.  :-(

I walked in and placed my order.   The menu seems to be decent enough, with a fair amount of selection.  Ample amounts of toppings, and you can have your burger a few different ways. Mind you, I'm a burger lover, so I'm always up for places like this.

I ordered a regular burger with all the fixings and BBQ sauce on top.  I got the fries too.  It came in a brown bag..I guess thats how they serve it regardless if you eat in or not.

I was dissappointed with the burger itself.  It seemed like it came with way to much topping. I mean, like an overwhelming amount.  I ate it, and the burger was okay, but not as good as I have experienced at other comparable places.  I wasn't looking to be \"blown away\" by the burger, but I wasn't really impressed over all.  It wasn't that great, to much on the toppings, and it didnt really do much for me.  I will say tho, you get a TON of fries tho.

I left feeling underwhelmed, and don't know that I will be back in the future."}
{"text":"I LOVE THEIR BURGERS AND CAJUN FRIES!!!!

If you're getting fries make sure you have someone to share with because a small is a small garbage bag of them lol!

The burgers are always so fresh and delicious!!! If you're trying to watch calories or can't have gluten, then they can do lettuce for a bun. It's pretty messy this way but makes me feel good about the compromise!"}
{"text":"i went here for the first time back in July on my birthday OMG it was so good and very inexpensive at that i went then and have returned many times to this location would totally suggest others visit"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Five Guys - when I was on the East Coast this was the best.

However, lately I've been ordering burgers on lettuce leaves and this was by far the worst one I've had.  I asked the cashier if they could wrap the burger in lettuce leaves (like In-n-Out does so well) and what I got was a foil packet with my meat, cheese and mushrooms on a bed of chopped floppy lettuce with more thrown on top.  Yuck!  There wasn't a nice crisp piece of lettuce to be found."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best fast food burger on the planet. Period. End of story.

Pros: see above, best tasting burger with lots of cheese and any toppings you want. Never a long wait even when the line gets long. Fries are big and natural and they serve a ton of them per order. They have the giant Coke machines with thousands of varieties of flavors.

Cons: No drive-thru. Quite pricey for fast food but worth it. 

Will definitely continue eating at every location as often as possible."}
{"text":"Worst five guys I've been in. Fries weren't the correct amount nor cooked. Usually I don't have this problem with five guys but this one experience was so bad it has just left a bad taste in my mouth. 1 customer was waiting on there 4 burger order in front of me who ordered 1 burger and 1 order of fries. 32 minutes later I receive a 14 dollar bag of raw fries that barely filled the cup they where served in. Burger was the only edible thing edible it sucks that they took down the prosperity location because this one sucks"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and it is always seems to be the same.  The first half of my burger is great! Then the bun begins to crumble and fall apart.  This leaves me with an ugly mess on the wrapping in front of me and really just disappointed.  

I have no complaints about the fries, they are actually very good.  The Cajun fries especially.  I only wish they had cheese fries.  Damn that yahoo article that told me otherwise..."}
{"text":"A pretty damn good burger!  I am a follower of In-N-Out and this place is right up there with them.  A perfectly done burger with a generous helping of fries and a shake...in one word....glorious!"}
{"text":"I was expecting off the chain bomb burgers...but they were okay .. no I'll tell you when I really read all the reviews that were on the wall those are dated from 2008 2012, 2009.. etc. Also they work for different locations all over the US.

The cajun fries were spicy with a kick but they were the little salty.  The location we were at was Lake Mead.. the cashier was helpful the fact that it's our first time."}
{"text":"I always like Five Guys from other cities, so thought I'd check out this relatively new location. All the staff was super friendly and the food was consistently good. The place was a bit dirty (floor and tabletops), which was a bit disappointing, considering they weren't very busy. Hopefully this will improve. I don't understand the location, across the street from the big Micky D's."}
{"text":"Very good burgers though a bit pricey.  Nice change from the regular burger when you want something better."}
{"text":"5 Stars for what it is. Simple delicious burger and fries. Plenty of toppings and great fries. 

Only thing missing is a good milkshake on the menu."}
{"text":"What is all the hype about??  I went to FGBF after the 'Best Fast Food Burgers' came out earlier in the year just so I could validate their claim.  I can honestly say that although the meat seemed fresh, not frozen, my burger lacked seasoning in a big way.  This could be the fault of the burger cook and I really hope this is the case.  I love the fresh cut french fries and the quality of the toppings.  I didn't realize that a \"burger\" was actually a double cheese burger, a lot more then I was expecting. 

Now I am giving this place a 4 star rating only because I am overlooking the seasoning issue.  I would rank it as one of the 'better' places to get a burger if your options are McD's, Burger King, or Wendy's, but if you are just out to get over a burger craving, you are in luck.  Cleveland has some of the best restaurants around for finding a good burger.  For instance, if you are in the area of FGBF, go over to Cork and Bottle, their burgers are pretty good and you can get a beer.  If you are in a hurry though, feel free to stop in to FGBF, just make sure they put some seasoning on.

I will be back to give it another shot.  A drive thru would be really nice to have here.  Get the Jr. if you're not that hungry."}
{"text":"Five Guys is a great place! The burgers are very good and the fries are good! If you go with someone else, you only need to order one regular size fries as it easily will feed both of you. Also they have peanuts available for you to eat while waiting for your order to be cooked; therefore, anyone with peanut allergies may need to stay away."}
{"text":"I had a good experience at Five Guys, had seen em back home, while I was in vegas a buddy suggested we have five guys, good burger, real, and fresh, unlike most FF joints. I liked the peanut thing, reminds me a few old bars bar in the day. I really lied the frys.  Sadly most burger joints either have good fries, and ok burgers, or vise versa, but Five guys has done well on both."}
{"text":"I like to eat a lot and it's not very often the food served to me fills me up. 

The portion sizes at Five Guys does that and more. Often times and order of a burger and fries is brought home with me for later. The first time I went I made the mistake of ordering a double burger with a large fries - something you might have no trouble polishing off at another burger joint. 

Not the case here. 

In addition to the quantity, the quality is top-notch. Burgers are made fresh as you order and ingredients are visible from in front of the counter. You can tell they're fresh and in good shape. 

The burger itself is moist and flavourful but the flavour comes from the beef itself and not a bunch of other ingredients thrown in (they may indeed have spices and what not in there, but I didn't take note of them like other burger joints). The bun is lightly grilled. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

Back to the ingredients: I usually get ketchup, mustard and lettuce on my burger. I was really impressed how crisp the lettuce was. This stuff was fresh!

The fries are also like the buns - crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. There's also A LOT OF THEM! My advice, order the small.

What sucks about Five Guys is the price and the wait. Even when I've visited Five Guys with just a few people in line it seems like an unusually long amount of time to get your order. Also, the prices are steep for a burger and fries despite it being one of the best burgers and fries in town."}
{"text":"Yum yum! Best fries ever! Burger wasn't that shabby either!! The staff that work here were friendly and welcoming and made sure the place was clean! Definitely worth the drive if you are a French fry snob!!!"}
{"text":"This Five Guys is always friendly and fast. I have never seen it packed in here so always ample seating. Nothing out-of this world food-wise but we're talking about fast food here people. The fries are tasty and the burger toppings generous and fresh. I recently discovered how much selecting 'extra cheese' enhances my experience!

If you're in need of a quick bite in the area of Westgate, this Five Guys is a good bet."}
{"text":"Best Burger and fries around. Never had an order messed up (or amy issues at all) and we've been here many, many times."}
{"text":"My mother and father and I went here after a movie, and got there 1 minute before close, when we asked if we could order and eat, the two people on staff without skipping a beat graciously welcomed us to do so. They were nice, friendly, and made us some great burgers. That is the type of business model that Empires are built on. Thanks Five Guys!"}
{"text":"Just came here the other night for the first time and my experience was great. Service was good, people were nice, clean environment, food was amazingggg. That bacon burger and Cajun style fries. On point. Would definitely recommend this place. Might even go again tonight haha. :)"}
{"text":"Simply the best bacon cheeseburger around. The fresh-cut fries are perfect as well. If you're looking for a regular burger and fries there is no place better."}
{"text":"Non-yelper friend: \"How would you rate 5Guys on a scale of 1-10?\" 
Me: \"You mean... how many stars would I give 5Guys out of five?\" 
Non-yelper friend (looking super confused): \"Sure...I guess? Isn't that the same thing..\"

The verdict:

Five Guys could never out compete In-n-Out in California. They give wayyyyy more meat per burger than In-n-Out (at no extra charge!), but I have to say that the In-n-Out cheeseburgers are way more delicious than the cheeseburgers at 5Guys. Since that is all I eat right now - that is all I can really comment on. However, the fries were also not very impressive....they didn't add any extra oomph to the meal. 

I think my favorite part of the meal was the free peanuts - and that is not what 5Guys is all about."}
{"text":"This place was alright. It was very overpriced (40$ for 3 meals). The food wasn't really good at all except for the burgers. It's not really clean there and the people are so unenthusiastic. I got sick after the food too. Disappointed."}
{"text":"If you like red meat, specially beef this is the joint that will give you the burger fix when you need it.
My husband loves this as it is 15 minutes away from our place, parking is not a hassle on week days and the \"burger is really good\". His favorite is the Hamburger and the sweet potato fries. I think he loves the spicy fries more than the burger and is a happy  man when he is done devouring the giant burger.
The soda machines are fun but I do not recommend drinking a lot of soda (for health reasons). It can be a good place to get your kids to enjy a family lunch while you are  on Mill avenue."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but overpriced. Service was friendly. Their very limited menu did not offer shakes and malts which was disappointing.  Their dinning environment was uncomfortable for such high prices."}
{"text":"Dang, why has it taken me so long to come to 5 guys... I have been missing out.  The burgers are not only good, but they are delicious, moist, and you can pile as many toppings as you want on top!!  The fries?  They are amazing.  Nice, fresh, and fried deliciously.  The only thing that could make them better if they were more crispy, but they were great.  The staff was also really kind and fast!  Very great experience."}
{"text":"Super Lame - their vegetarian sandwich is a plain bun with your choice of their free  toppings. It's better to just offer no vegetarian option in my opinion."}
{"text":"Night staff rude as hell. 
Serious attitude issues. It just hit 10 and I was inside and the lady said \" hey, we are closed, we close AT 10\"  
6 customers still inside. And they just got finished serving 2 people in front of me. 
Not going here no more."}
{"text":"Maybe I had a high expectation, and five guys disappointed me a little bit. 
I had a cheeseburger. Oh boy. Two thick meat patties. First couple bites were good with the mushroom and onion. When I reached the center, there was no sauce or any other tasty flavour but meat, so flavourless. I was reluctant to have another bite until I moved on the the edge. 
I really like the peanuts. Worth the price of the burger which is not low. 
My hubby really loved the poutine. Hot gravy melted all the cheese. Keep the fries warm, as well as his heart."}
{"text":"The posters lining the walls talking about how good this place is are mostly from the last decade, because all the cool new burger place are better without question. So what if the fries come in portions you struggle to finish on your own? They're not that good. There aren't many cool toppings to choose from. Ooh, American cheese...I'm enthralled...not. 

The burger is just ok. Not seasoned, buns aren't really toasted...just really low-effort. I would compare the quality to that of a place with a drive-thru, but a meal costs nearly what you'd pay at a sit-down restaurant. This chain is overrated."}
{"text":"Nothing particularly wrong with this location other than it can get very busy and they don't have the personnel to handle it.  The big problem is the burgers which are dry and flavorless, often overcooked, and obviously unloved."}
{"text":"Great burgers. I've tried the downtown Toronto young location and now east gwillimburry location. Exactly the same and good burgers. Today I went with the Mimi which was more than enough. Made to order as was hot and juicy. Nothing fancy - just burgers oh and hot dogs"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service.  Sometimes we get offered a free beverage while waiting for our order; sometimes not.  I wish the franchise would offer chicken sandwiches as well."}
{"text":"Consistently good.   Tried a BLT for the first time today.   Loaded with bacon that was not greasy.   It's good."}
{"text":"Very good. Quick service and accurate.
Although we had 4 bacon cheeseburgers, 1 large fry and two medium drinks... $47!!!
They are not skimpy on the large fries!!! 1 was plenty for our family of 4!
Bacon was crisp and delicious too."}
{"text":"As far as a chain restaurant burger joint this is up there as one of the best.  I agree with other reviews sometimes the fries are little soggy.  I've been to Five Guys in three different states and their very consistent.  The burgers are always great..."}
{"text":"Basically tastes like Freddy's up the street but 3x more expensive and more toppings to choose from. The Cajun fries are a solid option."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time in a long time. I usually go to In and Out. Great service but when I asked if fries could be well done was told no. Placed my order and sat down. Burger was good but fries were soggy and limp. I ended up throwing away half of them. I can't believe you can't order well done fries at a burger restaurant. I won't be going back because I absolutely hate soggy and limp fries. It's a shame because the overall experience was good. I would return if well done fries was an option. Guess I'll keep going to In and Out where I can get well done fries."}
{"text":"Great burgers. I rather eat here than McDonald any time. Burgers are cooked to juicy perfection with all the toppings you choose. The fries fried in peanut oil and is great. Peanut rules."}
{"text":"So whatever burger I eat, it has to have bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo. That's it. Lettuce, tomato and mayo tastes the same no matter the burger place. So what does it come down to when ranking a burger place as far as taste only is concerned?  It must be the beef, the bacon and the bun. In most places I go, the bacon is usually overcooked. So that makes everyone equal so far. So move on to the beef and the bun only. Here, nothing special about the bun. I can get the same taste from packaged buns at Safeway. So then the beef. It must be seasoned properly and let's just assume cooked properly. Today's experience was just plain. I was not gaga.  I want to be blown away. I wasn't.  I still recommend coming here. But I do not rank five guys among the best anymore. Its still good stuff, just not tops.Sorry."}
{"text":"So I went to the gym, and then to Samarai Sam's to get a healthy teriyaki bowl for lunch. Every time this happens, I see Five Guys and I use all my willpower to resist going there instead.  Well, I succeeded once again today and got my healthy teriyaki bowl and headed back to work.  Suddenly, without my having any clue as to how it happened, I found myself at the counter of Five Guys ordering a little bacon burger with mayo, lettuce, pickles, onions, ketchup, and mustard and an order of cajun fries.  WTF just happened?!?!  Burger magic?  Well, I decided to just go with it, seeing as to how it was too late to turn back.

Just a tip if you've never been there before: a \"LITTLE\" burger is a normal sized burger.  If you order the regular, it will come with double patties.  Don't get me wrong, the more meat, the better, but it's a lot of food and you have to be prepared to be hit with something like that.  The Little versions are about 300 calories less.  

You walk in and up to the counter and place your order.  Toppings are free, which is a huge plus!  Then they give you a number and you wait until they annoyingly scream your name or number out.  They have this amazing Coke machine that seriously looks like an arcade video game.  I don't drink soda so I didn't mess with it, but I did watch as a very elderly gentleman attempted to find a type of soda he wanted and quickly became frustrated and confused.   An employee cleaning tables nearby hurried over to help him.  Everyone here is so nice and chipper!  I love it!

Best of all, the burgers are freakin amazing.  They are juicy, and just the right amount of greasy.  The cajun fries have a kick to them and they taste like heaven dipped in ranch.  This is one of my favorite burger spots in Las Vegas.  Guess I'm having teriyaki bowl for dinner.  :/"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger joints. Now to be honest, I don't eat burgers that often as I prefer something 'slightly more adventurous and healthy' as a general rule, but they are on my 'cheat list' - and when I get a craving for a burger, THIS is where I come, great tasting meat, excellent onions, nice bun... the fries are fine too - and the staff are always friendly, courteous and efficient."}
{"text":"What is not to love.  An appetizer of peanuts for and then burgers that are fresh and full of good ingredients.  I always share the regular fry with a friend it's just too much for a single person. Love the soda machines!! I look forward to coming back again soon.  Always good service, definitely cannot complain... Prices for 2 to eat the single burger, share a fry, and a drink was $17.. Not cheap..but if you want quality products you're going to pay for it."}
{"text":"I finally got to try the alllll so famously awesome Five Guys, I mean it has to be good if the president loves it.... meh! 

So, here I am stuck down town on a particularly HOT Monday enjoying my mandatory jury duty. So not fun! I have found myself faced with 2 hours for lunch, where to go. Well, I saw Five Guys on the corner and get 'em a try. It was a zoo, line for miles and people everywhere, no ones fault but the location. 

The menu is very simple; burger, cheeseburger, bacon cheeseburger, grilled cheese, hot dog, plenty of fix-ins to choose from, two sizes of fries. I ordered a cheeseburger and a regular (the smallest size) order of Cajun fries (spicy seasoning). The quality of the burger was good, however it normally comes with two patties of meat, which I do not care for. The fries were the most disappointing. They weren't cooked enough, and the bag they handed to me with full of fries, I had to go fishing for my burger. Messy and irritating. 

I might try them again, but I will skip the fries and ask if I can get only one patty."}
{"text":"Burgers are amazing. Fresh, juicy with a top quality meat. They are pricey for fast food place."}
{"text":"Great burger, but the fries were wanting.  Nevertheless, the shared order was fully consumed.  The burger was well cooked - not well done - and condiments added nicely to the flavors.  Just the right amount of \"busy\" at 7pm and the peanuts are a nice way to spend a few minutes chatting while waiting for the order to be announced.  5 Guys is a nice alternative to In&Out.

I'd not heard about 5 Guys until recently and a shop in Massachusetts caught my eye enough to take a photo.  A friend runs a video post house in L.A. named \"5 Guys Named Moe\" after the famous pop tune from the 40s.  \"Who's on first\"?"}
{"text":"OK, I came here two weeks ago as the kids were with their friends at raising canes.  So, I had waited for them and wanted a burger......

a. Holy peanuts Batman - They have tons of sacks of salted peanuts and paper dishes you can pack up with tons of these.  Eat them, spill them, snack on them while your custom made burger comes out and it is truly a cool experience!

b,  The ordering - I find it a bit challenging due to the very lengthy list of extras and things you can put on the burger.  I was tempted to have many things and so you get it, but it does make eating your burger very difficult unless you have a very large orifice!  Watch it!!!

c.  The noise - Man is this place noisy.  The food order takers and the kitchen people are all yelling out the orders an processing your order.  It takes a bit to get used to, but besides the noise, the good thing is that you can hear your order getting done.....

d.  The Freakin Fries - ORDER ONLY A SMALL - and you will be luck you don't get a lunch bag size container full of overflowing fries.... What a great value and especially if you are on that high carb lo protein diet that is working out for so many of us!!!  This is like the best deal in the nation.

e.  The soda - Five Guys, home of the wonderful coke machine that is like that Star Trek TOS Food Replicator.  You can have so many flavors of your favorite coke, and then add any liquid add in like lime, cherry, lemon and you have a great tasting soda!

f.  The taste - Nice burger, they cook it to one temp.  If you leave the burger in its wrapping too long, it will get soggy and your burger falls apart as you touch it.  

Price wise, not bad, a decent value overall.  I like the experience and will come back."}
{"text":"I really like this place and the free peanuts are a plus.  No parking, long line, full tables, people waiting at the soda fountain for their drinks.  This place is like a rock star burger place.

Service - No need to rate it since it is more or less serve yourself. 

Ambiance - You would think we did not have an energy crisis with all the lights and totally bright atmosphere.  If anything is a five star in this place, it is the lights. If you are on a first date, don't go here or your date will get too good a look at you in the most blazing light possible!!!

Food - Easy menu, easy extras and plenty of them. Onions, mushrooms etc, great and easy.  Really tasty and really good burgers. Could not tell the difference between the Cajun Fries and regular, but they do give you alot of fries.  There are a ton of peanuts that you can grab, put on your table and start eating. Kinda cool.  If you have BIG HANDS, it is easy to eat the overfilled and soggy burger. I normally don't like soggy, but it was good.  If you are petite or a kid, well, just bring extra napkins and good luck.

What happened to the - Where are the shakes at? Come on, if you are going to fatten up, do it right! No shakes?

Price - Not bad.  Family of 5 that each had a burger, drink and shared two fries - 55.00 approx. Not the greatest deal, but not bad.

I find that In and Out does it right and has a great price. Red Robin does it right as well, and for the price vs. quality, I think I will continue to frequent In and Out and come to Five Guys if/when it is convenient."}
{"text":"There's been a lot of hype surround Five Guys new location at Yonge & Dundas.  I had never tried it before, and I work around the corner so I decided to check out what all the fuss was about.

I got there 15 minutes after they opened on a Wednesday, and there was already a lineup!  First thing I noticed though, was that it smelled like a meat packing plant in there.  Seriously ew.  As I waited in line, I almost had to walk out because of the smell.  My co-worker however was even more eager to try it, so we stayed and waited to place our order.

Line moved relatively quickly, and I ordered a cheeseburger (the double stack one), and Regular Fries.  They have a bunch of toppings to choose from.  Grilled onions and mushrooms are a nice touch, but not much different than South Street Burger Co. Order came to $12.86.

Once the food was ready they handed me my paper bag and off I went to work.  3 minutes later, the bag was SOAKED in grease.  Upon opening the bag I discovered an abundance of fries in there!  TONS!  Again, I ordered the smallest option (regular), and it's easily enough for 2-3 people.
The burger itself was pretty good.  Five Guys pride themselves on being free of preservatives and you can tell by the taste of the burgers (might explain the smell of raw beef in there).  Although good, it didn't knock my socks off.  The fries were also okay.  Nothing special.

I'm giving this place 3 stars.  I suppose it's tough to make yourself stand out in an over-saturated \"burger joint' market.  They certainly try here, and do well south of the border, but for a couple bucks more, I'd rather sink my teeth into a burger at \"Hrvati\" ANY day.  They put their own individual spin on a traditional hamburger, and pull it off in spades!"}
{"text":"This place has great burgers BUT the cost is too much.  This makes going here a one in a while excursion rather than a regular one.   Wish they had a combo deal instead of ala carte ordering.  This makes it very unlikely for any family outings here without having to pay by credit card.   I suggest a re-think in the pricing model since everything's by has to be fresh here, how much waste is produced and how much of the costs is pushed onto the consumer. ."}
{"text":"It's a made-to-order burger place, so I won't go overboard in detail.  To me, Five Guys makes a good burger, as long as it's quickly eaten and it's not greasy off the grill.  Overall, my orders and food have been consistent.  And in my experience with this particular Five Guys, if it's not, then talk to the manager.  A while back, I did, and he made it right.  I'd rather help than hinder.  How else can you improve if need be?  But that's what I'd like to comment on: customer service.

Every time I go into this location, the service is friendly.  That counts, IMO.  And as I stated previously, the manager is helpful and wants quality to go into your bag and out the door.

If I'm in the mood for a made-to-order ham/cheeseburger, I think of Five Guys first.  Plus this location is convenient and local.  I haven't tried to order \"online\" via the Five Guys app, but that's on my to-do list!

Also, it should be noted that Five Guys does a \"bunless\" burger, either in a bowl or wrapped in lettuce, which the wife likes/needs.  It's not a special request either; it's on the menu (and on the app menu too).  Whataburger (Peoria/Sun City) doesn't do \"bunless,\" or at least they don't wrap in lettuce.  In fact, they didn't even offer an alternative while in the drive-thru.  Lame.

If there is one improvement I could make for all Five Guys is that the burgers should be wrapped in paper.  There is something goofy with aluminum foil.  It seals in too much moisture and doesn't allow the burger to breathe.  So unwrap and eat it quickly, or it could get soggy on the ride home.  Also, it needs a \"light touch\" during the wrapping process.  Otherwise, the bun gets a little smooshed.  Ditch the aluminum foil Five Guys Corporate!"}
{"text":"I love the Cajun fries here, but beware a little is enough for one person. The regular will be more than enough for two people to share. There's peanuts to eat while you wait. Burgers are made to order. This location also offers milkshakes."}
{"text":"For a quick burger and hand cut fries, this is perfect. I also got an Oreo milkshake and it was delicious. I can never go wrong with this place. The staff is always so nice."}
{"text":"I've been on a healthy eating kick lately so I haven't had many delicious burgers.  After a rough day at work, my wife and I decided we needed some greasy food and this sounded just right!  I had been to a Five Guys in NYC last year but didn't really remember it.  I have to say, this was a great burger.  

I had burger with cheese, bacon, grilled onions, and pickles.  It really hit the spot and satisfied my burger craving.  The Cajun fries were good as well.  These burgers are pretty big but it was so good I wish I had two.  Well, I had one and a half because my wife couldn't finish hers.  I love how they dump extra fries in the bag.  I really don't eat fries that much anymore but if you're going to eat them, you might as well go big!

I worked out extra hard the next day and it was like it never happened.  But the taste remained and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The burger was ok......that's it. The fries were soggy with grease and the place was too loud with music and the interior screamed of an In-N-Out rip-off. Including a Coke my  meal came to almost $10........ WTF! Sorry guys...... Smash burger has a better burger and a more pleasant ambiance plus they offer beer. I won't be back....... Hell..... for that money there's a Whiskey Dicks bar 150' away next door on east Craig road that serves much better burgers also...... What a joke of a place!"}
{"text":"Burgers are bland. Whats the big deal? Fries are good. In-n-Out is much better!"}
{"text":"1st thing, if you have any type of peanut allergy do not go to a five guys. They have free peanuts while you wait which is always nice.

We do so enjoy the Five Guys and this one does not disappoint. 
 
The burgers are always made to order which means it takes a little longer than fast food joints, but it is worth the wait.  A couple can easily share even a small fry as they give you quite a bit with your order.  The Cajun fries add just a little bit of seasoning but not enough spice too be too hot.

If you are looking for a nice burger without being fast food this is a good place."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better burger places in Ajax. Quick service and usually the order of fries can feed an army. Standard five guy quality burgers."}
{"text":"had a bacon cheese burger and medium cajun fries. they even dumped extra fries in my bag. so awesome! the food here is amazing. the only gripe i have about it is that its a lil pricey"}
{"text":"Only one star due to the extreme loudness of the music. Can't carry on a conversation or hear when your order is up. Turn it down a bit.  Love the food ur won't eat inside due to loud music"}
{"text":"Five Guys is great for those days when you want to spend $12 on a glorified fast-food hamburger. The meat comes in a wafer-thin patty, and doesn't really taste like anything, just like at Wendy's. The bun tastes mass-produced. 

I also don't especially care for their fries, although this is a matter of taste more than anything. I'm not generally one for mushy, thick, \"natural\" fries of the sort served here. 

I can't help but wonder if people rate this place purely on the quantity of food that you get. The normal size for the burger is a double-patty, and the fries come overflowing from a 12 oz. drink cup. 

I would rank the burger places around mill as:
1) Smashburger, for their delicious Arizona burger, and the awesome smash fries
2) Chuckbox, for delicious char-grilled meat that actually tastes like meat
3) In-n-out, for great-tasting meat and some of my favorite fries
4) Five Guys,
5) Fatburger, seriously why the fuck does anyone eat at Fatburger?"}
{"text":"It was ok. an 8 to 10 minute wait in an empty burger joint. And they tend to over cook the burgers just a wee bit for my tastes. I like SOME juice to be flowing from my 11 buck cheese burger......but otherwise friendly service and no mistakes on my order, so yeah, 3 stars"}
{"text":"Love Five Guys. Burgers are juicy.. Cajun Fries are highly recommended. 

Generous portion of Fries. You can order the Little size as there's always 2 extra scoops on top. 

Excellent Service. They skipped our order by error.. After a few orders past.. I followed up.. and they comped our meal! It's not a lot of money but the gesture is very welcome."}
{"text":"Friend told me this company had great burgers. We had large burgers and fry's. Burgers had to be cooked hours before we got there, cold, dry. Fry's were cold. Plain english, don't waste you money."}
{"text":"Been to this location three times since I've moved out here. 

Pros: Always extremely clean, staff is really friendly. They even helped my mom order for her first time (and changed the order when she changed her mind with no hassle)

Cons: Food takes a while to cook. However, it always tastes good so I try not to complain :)"}
{"text":"I had read the reviews and people all over were talking about Five Guys, it was just a matter of finding time. Today there was time. I walked in and was greeted by a cashier and menu board, given a number and sat and waited for our food. 

My impression was, its very white, with red accents. The corrugated plastic signs are cheesy and they are all over in here. 

Our number was called and I got the bag of food and did enjoy the burger for sure, I thought its above average, juicy but not too greasy. The fries were huge as described, but were way over salted. They would have been much better with 2/3 less salt."}
{"text":"After hearing my friends back home in NY rave about the 5 guys that opened up shortly after I moved to the left coast, I was excited that a 5 guys was coming to a plaza only a few miles from my house..

I knew this place was expensive based on the other reviews I had read but I wanted to try it anyway.

I got a little cheeseburger since it was slightly cheaper than their regular, double burger.  For the price it was definitely not worth it.  I'd actually prefer create, which is more expensive than In-N-Out but cheaper than this place and better quality as well.

The burger was just OK... nothing special about it and the fries were super soggy and had no flavor at all.

I probably won't go back to 5 guys now that I've experienced it."}
{"text":"Few things make me happier than a juicy, fresh beef burger and a big pile of greasy french fries.

Five Guys made me VERY happy in this regard.  Fresh beef, and real potatoes.  It's everything I like from In 'n Out, but done bigger and better.  Yes, get the bacon cheeseburger.  It's messy, and you'll need napkins, but it's got PRIMO flavor.  You think the french fry at the bottom of the bag at McDonald's is good?  Try them here!"}
{"text":"The fact that everyone here is so friendly is what makes me what to come back! They always have a smile on their face and don't hesitate to help you out ! If no one is at the register, the cooks welcome you with a smile and start talking to you getting what you want ready. And lets not forget about the food. The burgers here are expensive BUT so delicious!!! They are worth it! The cajun fries are my favorite. Nothing can beat this burger place. Love it."}
{"text":"This place...omg this place! A...Mazing! Everything is to die for. The burgers ,the fries!...omg. It's a little pricey compared to other fast food joints but you really get what you pay for. The burgers are delicious & the Cajun fries are amazing. I'm not sure what's going on with the kitchen chatter, they shout out weird random chatter as they cook, not sure what that's about, but whatever, the food is top notch! & they don't skimp on the fries, they load em up! If I have the extra shekels I definitely go here!"}
{"text":"A good, consistent burger.  Their fries are great!  Kinda pricey..."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, very good burgers and Cajun fries, the kitchen looked really clean (everything is out in the open so you can see clearly which I like) but the restaurant part itself was a big mess. This is one of those tough ones where I know the mess is due to them not being able to keep up with the disrespectful and rude ppl who eat there. While I was there I saw several kids openly making a mess with everything they could get their grubby hands on from the ketchup pumps to the ice maker to throwing salt, etc while their parents just chatted ignorantly next to (and over and under and between) them. Shame too because the food is really good compared to any fast food place burger but it's way too far from my house to grab to go smh. People, please control your children as not everyone finds their messes as charming, adorable, or precious as you do. We are not as expert as you seem to be at tuning them out and we would appreciate an opportunity to eat without dodging being salt-and-pepper sprayed. Besides, I don't feel particularly proud of myself after giving one of your brats a dirty look which conflicts with the joy of eating my tasty burger!! Stop thinking of only yourself and think only of ME!! :)

This is another one of those reviews that would benefit from a half star rating as I feel a 3.5 is more fair but between a 3 and 4, I have to go 4 due to the freshness and seasoning of the burger and fries."}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries! They also have free peanuts to munch on while waiting for your order. They've got one of those newer Coke machines with all sorts of flavor! The guy who took our order was really nice. The food came out at a reasonable time. Only problem was my husband asked for jalape√±os and green peppers on his burger and got neither. He didn't wanna bother since he didn't pay for it anyway. We wanted to get 4 large fries since there were 7 of us and the cashier told us 2 will be enough. I'm glad we listened to him coz it was more than enough! We didn't even finish the 2! They're huge portions of fries. I did prefer the Cajun style (with lots of malt vinegar!) next time I'm gonna ask for extra seasoning. The burgers are huge as well. I wish I got the little bacon cheese burger since that only has one patty, the regular has two."}
{"text":"Usually, I love 5G, but recently this one has had falling standards. For the second time this week, their fries have been burnt and come out slow. 10 minutes? For fries? No. All I ever order is fries, and they've usually been good up until now. If I wanted to wait 10+ minutes for food, I would go to Wingharts or the Yard. But for now, I guess I won't be coming back until the girl that burns fries quits or otherwise."}
{"text":"The food and service are good.  The prices are too much.  4 burgers, 3 shakes, no drinks but water, no fries.  $47.  That's too much.  And they forgot bacon on my wife's burger."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times. The customer service here is great. The place is clean, the food is received quickly and the food is great. I've never had any issues here. Even with it being on the famous Las Vegas strip, the place is never too busy, so there's always a place to sit. The order moves quickly too, so I've never waited in line more than 1 person behind the front of the line."}
{"text":"Returning home from a weekend in Cleveland and a Indians and Browns wins, we wanted something quick. Always good burgers, mine \"all the way\" or with whatever you want on them. Fries cooked just right. Service was fast and friendly even tho there was a small rush walk in behind us. Seemed like good team work."}
{"text":"Yum. Messy & delicious. Burgers are great, but the fries could use some work. They're always super greasy."}
{"text":"Yum. Messy & delicious. Burgers are great, but the fries could use some work. They're always super greasy."}
{"text":"Screwed up my order on multiple occasions, im def not going back anymore. The one on Eastern is way better!!"}
{"text":"The burger (I get the bacon cheese burger, that comes with two patties) is the best burger you can get out of a \"fast food\" style joint. Destroys Burger Priest by a mile. Less greasy and more flavor...the way they season their meat is simply unreal."}
{"text":"The entire place is simple, but it is good and it's always been working. The menu is very small, but you can put however many free toppings you want on your entree. The fries are my favorite in the world, they are so fresh and seasoned well. They will be warm for 30 minutes after served. The Cajun seasoning is also great on the fries. The food is more expensive than fast food, but still affordable for the price of peanut oil and fresher ingredients with no preservatives. You can also get cartons of peanuts for free. A cool thing to look at is the whiteboard where they say the potatoes are from today."}
{"text":"I'm afraid my voice joins those who thought it was going to be something special. I was very disappointed--and not because the food was bad as it most absolutely wasn't. It was a perfectly good burger...BUT--and here's the point, NOT good enough to make me go back. Really, I can name a 1/2 dozen places that do burgers better, bud. 

Sometimes, my friends, the hype is just hype."}
{"text":"I've been 5 Guys many times here in metro PHX & other cities. Tonight this particular place had der fries over cooked! Dey were dark brown! I tried asking to make us another patch & I was told the fryer oil is dark. Typical excuse in my book. Not coming bak to this location."}
{"text":"Surprised I haven't reviewed it yet... solid burger, good for when you need some weight.

Got the chzbrgr. It was solid and reminded me of In'N'Out a little bit.  This one has more pizzazz.  Sometimes less is more.  Didn't like the fact that by the end, I was using a fork bc the bun was falling apart--needs to be more sponge-y.

The cajun fries are pretty good, but a bit on the salty side.  

Service good, prices decent.  

dmo out."}
{"text":"We wanted a burger today so we decided to try Five Guys. My daughter recommended this place so here we are. The service was friendly and prompt. I ordered the cheese burger which is really a double cheese burger. If you I want the single then order the lite. I like the concept of ordering your toppings. They have a nice selections of topping including grilled mushrooms and Jalape√±os. Burger were very juicy and tasty. The fries are good and fresh. They put your fries in a cup and then add extra by just dumping them in your bag. 
We sat outside cause it was a really nice day. I was impressed cause the place was very clean inside, outside, and the bathroom. They even had people wiping down the tables outside. Expensive burger for $6.59 each but worth it every once in awhile."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! I am not a burger person and I LOVE these. My husband does too. So happy to see they expanded to the west valley. Love the fries too. Also, as silly as it sounds, the soda machine is awesome!"}
{"text":"I am not a burger girl but this place is AWESOME. We don't have one on our side of town so on the weekends if we want a good burger, we make the diverges are super fresh and fires are simple but tasty. I would recommend ordering one regular size order of fires and sharing with 2-3 people. It is really a ton of fires. Overall I highly recommend even if your not a burger lover like myself."}
{"text":"I have tried Five Guys twice now. I have to say, the first time, I was not impressed.  I do not eat meat, so the only choice I thought I had was a veggie sandwich.  I loaded up on all of the veggies, and the sandwich would not stay on the bun, and was super messy.  

The second time I went recently, however, was a whole different story.  I ordered a cheese sandwich this time, and only put select veggies on it. It was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I have ever had!  The ingredients stayed on the bread, and they were fresh and exactly what I ordered.  My daughter got a basic one patty cheese burger with ketchup only, and said it was the best burger she has ever had.

The fries were great as always.  Now that I see others posting about putting vinegar on the fries, I will definitely have to try it.  I was also impressed with the soda machine.  At first it was scary, because it is one of those electronic touch screens.  I have never used one of those.  Once I figured it out, there were like 150 different choices!  I could get any Fanta flavor I wanted!  My boyfriend got his norm, and my daughter thought it was the coolest thing ever, and kept changing her drink.

All in all, this place is cool.  The food is good, there are tons of drink choices, you get free peanuts, and it's a fast paced, fun atmosphere.  It is really loud, so if you are looking to quiet place, this is not it."}
{"text":"Who doesnt love a good burger and ohhh myyy gahhhh their cajun fries are just die for! Don't come here expecting something fancy. It's just some good ole fashion burgers and fries! ;)"}
{"text":"This place used to have awesome burgers that were juicy and flavorful. Today's burger was dry and they forgot a topping. On top of that...I called in the order and still waited 15 mins after I paid. They dropped the fries about 10 minutes after I paid and gave me some excuse that the potatoes weren't ready. Of course my burger was luke warm, dry, & missing a topping. Didn't even mention the burger issue to the employees, but mentioned the extended wait time. They did say sorry. Oh by the way the restaurant wss completely empty.

1 star  for today. Like I said this place used to be awesome."}
{"text":"oh man, the bacon burger was one of the most delicious things ever. but an order of two burgers with a side of fries and a drink totalled around $25. which I thought was prettyyyyyy pricey for fast food burgers. 

I guess you could really make it worthwhile if you love peanuts...as they give you access to unlimited peanuts.

I'd come back to have that delicious fat burger again but only if I'm ready to splurge !"}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious! Love the sauce options.  My husband loves their hot dogs.  The fries are delicious and one order serves 3 people.  Even though it is a little pricey, I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers and fries!! Free peanuts while you wait for the grub even! Was clean, friendly, professional employee's,  with a great sense of humor to boot!! I will certainly be eating their again. A must eat for anyone."}
{"text":"Besides the delicious food the customer service at this location is out of this world good!!! Never and long wait and food is always fresh!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The wife and I ate there this afternoon. We were welcome as soon as we came in the door. We ha a very short wait for our food. Wow. The regular burger is a double and the regular size fries are enough for two or three people. The burgers were cooked perfectly and juicy. I had the juice running down my chin. I only wish they had onion rings"}
{"text":"I was not overly impressed with 5 guys.  We have only been to this place one time.  The guy who took our order was impatient and unfriendly when we asked questions about the menu.  

My burger was extremely wet which caused the entire thing to fall apart making it impossible to eat.  I also don't understand why they tell you that you can have anything that you want on your burger, but give such skimpy amounts.  ONE mushroom on a burger does not count as a topping.  

I agree that the fry order is strange.  It's fine for two people to share, but I can't imagine going solo for lunch and ordering such a massive amount of fries.  

I don't get the whole peanuts-in-a-burger-joint thing.......peanuts and burgers?

Prices are a bit on the higher side for such typical burgers.  Can't get out of there for under $10 person.  If the burgers were fantastic, I wouldn't mind the pricing, but they aren't that great.  

Smashburger will continue to get my business over 5 Guys."}
{"text":"Countless media articles both in print and online praised Five Guys as one of the best burgers in the country. Did you hear me? In ... the ... country. So when I was near one and hunger struck, what's a carnivore to do? 

The ordering process for a newbie is easy enough. Pick your burger and tell them what toppings you want, if any. It's all included so don't be shy. Seeing the concept as awesome, I added grilled mushroom & onions to my bacon burger. Added some fries and a shake to complete the high caloric meal. 

As I waited in anticipation, quotes of praises and magazine covers that featured Five Guys on one wall caught my attention. I read and waited for my culinary enlightenment. They called my # and I was at the counter in less than .7 seconds. 

The fries were hot, the burger felt heavy ... all is well, that is until I opened the wrapper. What faced me was a twin of dry patties, tons of various sized lettuce pieces, with bacon that fell apart in some areas, and remained chewy in others. The meat was dry and bland. It had zero flavor. No salt was spared, nor was any seasoning. I was chewing, but tasted nothing. Not the meat-ish product, not the grilled onion & shrooms... only tasted the lettuce. 
The fries were so salty that I had to stick them in the burger to serve as a flavor agent. 

The service was pretty good. They worked efficiently and were courteous. I would have given this FG location a 3 star, but after I ate and was about to leave, I saw a nice red roach making a run for the door w/o paying.

It's safe to say, I'm not returning to this chain any time soon."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers. Basically any topping you could want. They also have mini burgers for kids and smaller eaters. It can take a bit of time to get your order."}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly, the place is very clean, the food tastes great.

HOWEVER, in my humble opinion, the place is way too expensive.   I understand the business model, and I very much appreciate going in to a fast food place where the staff is actually friendly, outgoing, helpful, and speak intelligible English.

But about $15 for two grilled-cheese sandwiches, regular order of (Cajun) fries, and a regular drink?   To me, this makes Five Guys more of an occasional, intentional destination rather than a place I might frequent.    You can start to get a decent meal at a more comfortable place for about that same price -- Olive Garden for example.

I know Five Guys isn't McDonald's, but I sure don't think they're better enough to charge about triple the price of McDonald's, or twice the price of In & Out burgers."}
{"text":"Another good meal, Five Guys Burgers & Fries are consistent regardless of the location.  Their burgers are similar to old school backyard burgers with a good size patty and fresh fixings, but their meat is a tad greasy.  

What makes them unique is how they make your burger to order, they let you pick your toppings, which are all fresh.  Their fries are amazing! Love the seasonings that they put on them.  

This location is clean and the staff was all friendly, bathrooms are also clean and well stocked.  

This is a chain with pride, you will enjoy your experience.  WARNING: if you have peanut allergies, I'd consider another option.  The fries are cooked in no allergenic peanut oil, BUT, they have peanuts all over the restaurant, they offer FREE salted peanuts, which are very good, but also not ideal for some people."}
{"text":"Waiting to be impressed!
FOOD: Hamburger was just OK. Honestly, it tastes like something you can make at home. Very bland flavor, plain bun. Fries taste good but not crispy. They were greasy and limp. Soda cups are small for price.
PRICE: For a hamburger, fries and soda it's about $11.00. I can go to a buffet in town for that much.. They are really overpriced and offer no discounts, coupons or incentives to eat there.
Service: The people working there were very pleasant. Restaurant was very noisy inside.
For the $$, I suggest Red Robin, Chili's or Has House-A-Go-Go for better burger experience."}
{"text":"Nice outside curb appeal. Snack on some peanuts while waiting..  Great burgers ,cajun fried awesome..the coke machine with 130 combos is awesome."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. They know how to make me happy. They have that awesome computerized Coke machine with lots of flavors."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in the mood for a burger. Sure, we could have just \"settled\" but sifting through yelp we came across this place. Didn't disappoint!

Not only were peanuts at your disposal while waiting for your order, place was super clean, service was fast and friendly and our food was delicious! Burgers are huge, juicy and on a warm soft bun. And the amount of fries you get (which were hot and fresh) (and whether you got a small or large) over loaded the bag it was served in!!

Menu is limited, but what are you going to get at a burger joint other than a burger??"}
{"text":"this was the first time I have come to five guys, have heard all the hype, but truly believe that they are over rated,   I like that all of the burger topping are included in the price, and the burgers were cooked when order,  but after watching them cook the burger, they used a burger press and squeezed the heck out of the patties, which left the burger very dry. I was just amazed how the line cook was killing the meat by squeezing all the flavor out.    so because they will not cook to doneness and cook all burger to well done my burger was burnt and dry.  such a shame.   

not at the top of my list for burgers.

price is on the high side for a mediocre burger"}
{"text":"Not sure what the deal is.  I hear great things about this place from reliable sources but I was underwhelmed with my burger.  Don't get me wrong - it was a decent burger and the bacon was, I dare say, delicious.  But it's bacon.  
Think the issue with Five Guys is twofold:
1) They seriously need to put SALT on the patties.  Yeah whoever the five guys are....season your food.  Like In-n-Out does.  In-n-Out even has a sign you can see from drive thrus reminding their cooks to season the patty correctly.  Clearly no such reminder at Five Guys.  I've eaten at two locations in two states and this is a trend.  A bad one.
2) I'm all for picking your own toppings - I guess.  But how's about a burger you can just order off the menu?  Because, honestly, the first time I go to a place I usually ask for the most popular or recommended item.  Makes sense right?  You go in there and what do you do?  Order the burger with everything?  Just what you like?  Is this really a decision you can take time to make with 20 people behind you in line and you not wanting to be like the idiot in front of you who, LITERALLY, took 3 minutes 26 seconds to order his burger with 20 people behind him.  I timed it cause my uncanny douche bag spider sense tingled and knew it would happen.  

Fries were ok.  Next time I'll try the cajun ones.  They need to use smaller fries and hotter oil because it isn't crispy like McDonalds fries. Or double fry them because the fries do not have a crispy exterior.  WTF is with that.
Also, not necessary to carbo load so many fries in one order.  I'd rather pay less for less fries and not have to dig through fries to get to my custom ordered hamburger.  But that's a minor complaint.

But have to say it's way better than Fatburger, BK (obviously), McDonalds (obviously) and a whole host of those little hamburger joints that also serve breakfast.  It's also more expensive than these other places and not sure it's worth it.  

Oh yeah...their buns are the definition of mediocre.  Seriously, they should rename it Four Guys and send the fifth guy to learn how to make or buy decent bread.  It's awful for a $6 hamburger.  In-n-Out, on the other hand has epic hamburger buns."}
{"text":"Kind of hard to screw up burgers and fries.  I dig it-of course it's horrible for you, but everything in moderation."}
{"text":"There is so much competition in the upscale-burger market and in the Phoenix area, with Five Guys, Fatburger, In-N-Out, Smashburger, and Fuddruckers all vying for our dollars.  I've had all of these, and Five Guys is definitely the bottom of my list. My friends all disagree, and rave about Five Guys. I actually wonder if this location is the problem and not the food.

I do find it overly expensive for the amount of meat you get. The portions are closer to In-N-Out, but prices in line with Fatburger (whose Medium is the same price but a full 1/3 pound). The flavor was fine but not noteworthy. This location had stale rolls that were too big for the burger, a real disappointment. The fries come in huge portions and are very salty, which earned it the second star of my review. 

This location has a very cool soda fountain system with a touchscreen. But when we visited, it was out of a lot of flavors, and caused delays due to confusion (the elderly patrons) and kids thinking it was a toy. Plus, having only two fountains means that you can't squeeze in and get a Diet Coke while someone else gets a Sprite or Coke, so a line forms."}
{"text":"Waiting in anticipation of this opening for months now I stopped in on the 3rd day it was open. It is a simple place with free peanuts while you wait. The line moves very quickly and you get the food quickly as well. 
I ordered a basic cheeseburger and it was $5.69 , then regular fries for for 2.99 and a soda for $2.20 after tax it was $11.50 ish. Yes it is a little pricey for a burger joint and I know this part of town is going to say that a lot on these reviews but, the basic burger is big with 2 hand made patties and 2 pieces of cheese. There are a quite a few topping to choose as well. I just got mayo pickles and a-1. Very good, greasy and tasty. The fries were ok not amazing, they are fried in peanut oil and are fresh cut. I did however have way more than I needed for not getting a large. 

I will probably go a few more times on special occasions but, not make a habit."}
{"text":"So so quality. Sloppily made burgers. Robotic service. Doesn't deserve the central downtown location it's stealing from other, much better burger joints."}
{"text":"My quick summary:  Great food & more than prepared to work with dietary restrictions.

I know a lot of people complain about the noise level, but I happen to like it.  It really kind of goes with the whole experience.

The staff was really knowledgeable.  They knew what gluten free meant, and even the cashier knew off the top of her head that they had dedicated fryers, so the fries are also gluten free.  Most places look at me like I have eye growing out of my forehead.  And they'll customize your burger any way you like it.  Did you know they'll grill the jalapenos if you ask them?  I did.  :)

The soda machines are, in one word, awesome!  It's a touch screen.  You pick your drink type & it allows you to add flavor shots.  May I recommend the light cherry lemonade?  Great way to start a meal.

The burgers were perfect.  I watched the guy behind the line tenderly wrap mine in lettuce, since I can't have a bun.  And he then re-wrapped it after making sure the proper condiments had been put on (the guy in charge of that apparently wasn't sure).  The burger was wrapped so well, it really resembled a bun & I could have picked it up & eaten it with my hands, no problem.

The fries were warm, delicious, and plentiful.  They were seasoned perfectly.  My fiance & I shared a small order with our burgers, and there were still some left over.  Should have taken them to work & tortured my coworkers with the smell...  Oh well, there will always be next time."}
{"text":"It's a great burger. Although, I do agree that meat can use some seasoning. My fav is the saut√©ed mushrooms. A small order of fries feeds 2 adults and 2 kids with fries to spare. My kids love it here. From the peanuts, the super cool soda machine and of course the delicious burger and fries."}
{"text":"My favorite burger - 2 patties, double cheese, delicious. Juicy, just plane good overindulgence, confort food. Perfect if you just want an awesome burger. 1 small fries is enough for 2-3 people. Good music (rock). Enthusiastuc young staff. Just sodas - No liquor license (hence the 4 stars)"}
{"text":"I love 5 Guys fries.  I find the hamburgers average and usually get a cheese sandwich, which can be dressed like their hamburgers with grilled mushrooms and onions - YUM!  Like other 5 Guys, this location has the fancy soft drink dispensers so you can customize your drink as much as you'd like.  Two concerns are relatively small parking in the front (more parking in the outlet lot behind) and hot in the afternoon with the sun streaming in through the windows."}
{"text":"The best there is. If you love burgers, you'll love Five Guys. This location is as fine as any I've visited in the states. Clean, prompt and with friendly staff who genuinely seem to care about running a good ship.

If you've never been, I'd recommend ordering a \"little\" cheeseburger; the regular cheeseburgers are actually doubles. Personally, I think the balance of bun, cheese and meat is perfect in the little cheeseburger, but sometimes you just need a little extra meat."}
{"text":"Five Guys is a step above Burger King in burger quality.  If you're looking for a fast food burger, I'd keep it as an option, but if it's between this place or In-N-Out, just stick with In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Holy S*#t good.  I can only justify eating here if I've ran about 6 miles before and been eating healthy for awhile haha.  Don't bother ordering the large fries, the small order is enough for 2 people and the cajon style has too much salt stick with normal.  Sounds weird but you gotta check out the pop machine here too - dunno how it works but they have 100+ flavors of major soda brands."}
{"text":"First time going and it was delicious.
But I didn't realize the regular burger came as a double.
Way too much meat! I just wanted a regular cheeseburger.
But now I know better.  Everything was delicious though."}
{"text":"I'm a huge 5 guys fan and when it came to heartland I was stoked as I lived nearby. I always order the same; the bacon cheeseburger dressed all the way. It is 1100 calories of awesomeness. The best fast food burger you can get and I enjoy it more than a lot of the fancy dine in restaurants. I'm sure places like Holy Chuck and Burger Priest will serve better burgers, but for the price (under 11 dollars) this is so worth it for burger lovers."}
{"text":"I seriously cannot recommend the food served here. I was enticed to eat at this new downtown location because I had been so impressed with the french fries served at their south Phoenix restaurant.

The fries served here were terrible. My dining partner commented on how soggy and unappetizing they were and took them back to only have them replaced with equally depressing pile of soggy, soft fries. His experience in fast food restaurant management told him all he needed to know by watching them cook the fries. They overload the fryer baskets and never account for time required to bring the oil back up to the proper heat. The result is a soggy fry that tastes more boiled than fried.

A real disappointment and an expensive one at that. Most of my fries remained uneaten and the burger was greasy and flavorless. Quality control is not a priority here, but they are quite efficient at taking your hard-earned cash."}
{"text":"Good food, the fries are served in very generous portions, but the soda machines are the coolest ever!!"}
{"text":"Five Guys. Ugh. I feel torn.

One the one hand, I think that they are easily the best fast food burger place. Easily. Their burgers are pretty good!

On the other... it's fast food. The burgers are just too greasy and salty. For what you're paying at five guys, why not spend - I don't know - another two or three dollars and get a real burger?

One thing is for sure though - the fries are LEGIT."}
{"text":"\"Don't Believe the Hype\"

Sums it up perfect for me. I had heard a ton about this place before going there. For me it is a step up from fast food but still fast food. The burgers are big, but can only be cooked well done which is why I call it fast food. Fries and such are good and you get a ton. I guess I just heard so much hype to only be greeted with another upscale fast food place. 
If I want a greasy fast food burger I'll head to Swenson's!"}
{"text":"Love this place, their veggie sandwich is so much more than just bread, cheese and lettuce. They grill onions, peppers, mushrooms, and cheese into a delicious ball of perfection. 

Most impressive is the service, I order online and when i arrive, they greet my by name and make sure to wish me a great day on my way out. Stay classy five guys and see you next time!"}
{"text":"I was very excited it try this burger joint and was very disappointed. I ordered a hamburger and they made a cheeseburger. I sent it back and told the guy i didnt want cheese. So he made it again and guess what, it had cheese AGAIN! By the time I actually got my burger without cheese, I was full from eating fries and my husband's burger was cold because he was waiting for me. They didn't even offer to comp us for  anything.  I also thought it was dirty. The floors needed to be sweeped and the trash needed to be emptied. With so many other choices out there, I won't go back."}
{"text":"This five guys rocks ! Can we say always on point with the orders.  

I'm all about the lettuce buns these days , and what better burger place to deliver greatness? I don't know what it is about the preparation of their burgers but it's always satisfying . I usually get cheeseburger with cooked onions , mushrooms , and whatever condiment your heart desires . Simple , hearty, and well worth the price tag associated with it , my family can easily spend a cool $46 here in one trip . 

Aside from the well crafted burgers , my daughter raves about the fries . I mean a small is enough for two people to share and if you eat in you can feast on the fresh roasted peanuts until your order is ready . 

Thank goodness for excellent training here, this locations crew is quick and thorough.  High five to the management staff, been visiting this location for years now and not one complaint here ."}
{"text":"WOW!  This place rocks!  

I came here for the first time today on an impromtu lunch date with a few coworkers.  I keep seeing their take out cups from Five Guys and think of In N Out.  I'm quickly corrected if I were to ever express this comparison vocally.  Since I haven't ever been there, I thought today would be the best day to try it.

When you walk in, you're quickly whisked away to a diner-esque type setting, full of reds and whites.  The sack of potatoes line the way to the order counter and boxes of peanuts greet you as you find a table.  The staff is super young but really nice and courteous which is a huge bonus in my book.  

First of all, I can't say enough great things about their bugers.  It's juicy, succulent and really lives up to the saying, \"melts in your mouth.\"  I got the regular bacon cheeseburger, which comes with 2 patties.  I added mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions and mushrooms.  I also added the regular Five Guys style fries and a drink.  The burger was HUGE and sooooooo delicious!  The fries were thick hand cut fries.  Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside...just the way I like it.  BTW, the regular fries feeds two people.  I can eat a lot and had to share LOL.  My ONLY rant is that I don't think paying $15 for my meal at Five Guys or anywhere else for that matter is practical for one sitting, so I wouldn't be indulging here every week, but nice to have once in a while.

If you're a fan of In N Out, trust me, you'll LOVE Five Guys.  I can't believe that I haven't experience this wonderful place.  Check this place out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best burger joint in markham and it's not too far from home. Always try the Cajun fries as everyone recommends. Never too busy here as I do not see a time it can be backed up. Peanuts are a bonus for those who wait and unlimited refills of pop. Will come here more often."}
{"text":"Even if you hate the food, you got to love the people who work there. They are the friendliest of any burger places in Surprise. I have never been rushed with my orders and their suggestions help quite a bit, too. My son's favorite is the double bacon cheeseburger and mine is the single cheeseburger with mushrooms. If you are going to order fries for 2-3 people, order the regular sized one. It's more than enough. I love the food, I love the staff, and I love the ever confusing soda fountain. 5+++ stars!"}
{"text":"With In N Out and Smashburger down the street this place just above McDonald's but way over priced. ..nothing special
One thing this place leads is annoying their customers with the cooks saying the order and yelling back and forth...YEP!!!!"}
{"text":"Highly priced!!!
(none of the prices include anything other than the burger or dog)

Bacon cheeseburger.... 6.89
Cheeseburger ..... 5.99
Bacon hotdog.... 4.49
Bacon cheesedog.... 5.09
Bottled water...... 2.09
You have to order a \"lil\" to get a \"JR\" that is reasonably priced. But the burgers are almost child size.

While waiting on my Burger I noticed the \"grill master \" smashing the burgers to make em paper thin... Smh. I consider myself a Grill Master. NOTE TO 5 guys.. SMASHING your burgers is NOT whats up!!!....

New commercial should ask \"Where's the juice\" (as in juicy burger).... not where's the Beef."}
{"text":"Hello friends, 

Not much to add to the reviews that hasn't been mentioned before. This is a good location with plenty of parking in the pothole filled parking lot. 

They take call in orders which is a good thing because they do cook to order and It can get pretty backed up if there is a line of 3 or more.

The prices are not that great for the amount of food you get. Yeah Yeah Yeah. I know they give you buckets of fries. Yeah. Great. But it's a burger place that has fries. Not a fry place that sells burgers etc.

As with my other review for the location in center city; I kinda lost burger respect when I see them smashing their burgers in the grill top. Which is a Faux pas."}
{"text":"I got a cheeseburger full sized wrapped in lettuce and hubby got the hot dog and double cheeseburger. The Cajun fries were ahhhhhhmaaaaazing as always and the burgers were cooked to perfection. The portions were very reasonable for the size and the restaurant was clean, as well as the friendly staff :) oh and when you order pick up make sure you do it before you actually get there, the restaurant doesn't get the order until 5 min before pickup time"}
{"text":"The burger I had was so below my expectation: it was dry (of course, as the cook pressed all the juices out of it), the bread was spongy, the extra tomato I asked for was not added, I only had three tiny circles of pickles and a drop of mayo. Ketchup was the only item added in abundance.  Three stars for good service and an unlimited supply of super salty peanuts which you cannot eat many of anyway."}
{"text":"It's...okay.  Split a burger with the husband, got the cajun fries, that were excessively salty, but tasty.  It was loud and packed inside when we went, but we sat at a table anyways once the rear that was sitting there got up.  I'm surprised my husband didn't tear down an old lady just to get a seat (it was litterally packed).  Lots of topping choices, the burger itself was just a burger.   About $15 for two drinks, fries and a burger."}
{"text":"Out of all the things my mom in law and grandma in law wanted for a late Mothers Day they wanted a burger. They never tried Five Guys and neither has the BF and it's been forever for me so off we go. 

We each got a burger and got a large plain fries to share. You pick your basic burger which gives you the choice of amount of patty, with/without cheese and bacon then there are \"free\" toppings you can do. The one thing I don't like is how it is wrapped in foil and put in a bag so it got a bit smushed. The burger itself was really juicy. Because it is fresh made and wrapped in foil, I don't really feel this is good take out food and will get soggy. 

I don't get the In N Out comparison at all. I was talking to a friend online and the first thing they asked is if it was better than In N Out. Yeah they're both simple menus and serve it up fresh but the taste is apples to oranges. They're both good, and just different. If you like more toppings than standard, this is probably more of your place. 

I like their fries a lot. It's a good mix of a bit of a soft and crispy like a hybrid between a steak fry and a french fries. A large was shared between four people and we had some left. It is big servings....if you want fries it's probably good to share a regular between 2. 

Everyone talks about the machine and I pictured when people said they have ice tea that it would be attached to the machine and I can flavor it however I want. It was separate and standard Peak tea flavors so I was a bit sad about that. I ended up trying a few of the Dasani waters instead since I'm not really a big soda person. 

They were really efficient with the line and came to even check on us at our table which is a positive unusual for a fast food place.

Overall, it was pretty good and more importantly mom and grandma was happy. They are looking forward to the one opening on Lake Mead by their place and they really want to return. As much as I enjoyed the food at that moment, I had major itis and angry tummy. I just can't eat good and greasy stuff so it's not their fault at all. If you love a good burger though give this place a go."}
{"text":"Well. 
That happened. 
And while I'm sad to admit it happened...
I can say it probably won't again. 
Because there are so many better options and so many local options that I would be hard pressed to find myself making the mistake more than once. But maybe it had to happen?"}
{"text":"Don't overdo the toppings or you'll have to be eating off your foil. The thing I like is that the burgers are juicy but I kinda don't like it being wrapped in foil since if you're not eating it right away, it will get smashed and soggy. This I feel is more of a eat here fresh burger and not take out. I like getting A-1, mushrooms, onions and fresh jalapenos on mine. It's my favorite combo of toppings to do at home and glad theres a place I can have it made when I don't feel like grilling myself. 

The thing I like best though is the fries. I like semi thick, somewhat crunchy somewhat soft inbetween fries. I don't know why, but I can eat just a bag of fries and be perfectly content. 

The only minus is no brewed ice tea and while the soda machine is novelty cool, I actually don't drink soda. 

This is my 2nd place I've had Five Guys in Vegas and maybe my 4th time overall. I think I'm generally a fan despite not being a burger person really. Bagful of fries though - yes, please!"}
{"text":"Oh yes!!!!! Gosh these burgers are just so amazing. Juicy flavorful and huge. I got the little burger cuz that's really the normal size lol the \"regular\" one is just so big I can't finish it. The bacon, cheese, onion, ketchup, mustard :))) and most amazing patty :))) these are what burgers are meant to taste like. Now the fries :)))) oh my you have to get Cajun seasoning. And eat them before your burger cuz they are phenomenal while hot :) they also have a machine that dispenses any type and flavor soda you could want. My go to cherry coca cola :))) go go go now! I just ate and I want to go to give guys for a burger still ;)"}
{"text":"As a former In-N-Out loyalist (I currently pledge my allegiance to Shake Shack), I was always against Five Guys.

 In my wise old age, I can accept that Five Guys makes a pretty good burger with an awesome variety of fresh topping choices. Their grilled cheese is also surprisingly good. They turn the burger bun inside out and grill in a hefty amount of cheese.

I also enjoy the Cajun fries at Five Guys, but I could do without the regular ones. Also, get a regular size and split it- you still won't be able to finish it. Although I enjoy the Cajun fries, they've had some issues with inconsistencies. The second to last time I ordered them, the fries were so covered in the seasoning that they were almost inedible. Last time, however, it was like they gave the fries one paltry pinch of seasoning.

Customer service at this particular location is solid. Everyone is friendly and the food is quick. And they have the awesome soda fountain that has hundreds of flavors because this is America and we want choices dammit!

My gripe with Five Guys is the price. If my husband and I go, we get our own burger, split  Cajun fries, and my husband gets a soda. Our bill is just over $19. I have a hard time paying almost $20 for a fast food dinner for two, especially considering Habit is across the street and is also tasty but much more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. Maybe I'm just too loyal to In-N-Out, but I would take In-N-Out over Five Guys any day. The burger was good, but not great, and I could do without the fries. If it was cheaper, I would give it 3 stars, but $10+ for a burger, fries, and drink? I'd rather go to an actual restaurant. Or eat an In-N-Out a few times..."}
{"text":"Try the frys no salt!  You can taste the true potato fry that way!!  It has been great the this establishment has comed to Nevada.  I am sure that others would agree.  They typically give a a lot of frys.  Hopefully the West Flamingo location reads this.  They have been lacking in this department in my 5 recent visits.  The burgers are great, the selection of toppings is a bonus.  Add uncooked green bell peppers and you get a nice crisp surprise.  I have turned others I know to Five Guys Burgers and they have thanked me."}
{"text":"Really why waste my time reviewing 5 Guys....because the burgers are really THAT good!!!! Thick patty, great flavor, soft buns....OK...stop reading this review and give the burger with bacon a shot, you will thank me later!
If you get the cajon fries ask them for light seasoning...so damn good!!!"}
{"text":"No complains about this location. So far every order that i made here was good. Customer service was on point and courteous. Their burgers are great! They know what they're doing. They work efficiently, thanks for that! Always a smooth transaction."}
{"text":"Late review, trying to play catch up!
Went to this location about a month ago with my sister as my maiden visit to a Five Guys. Place was nice and clean. Open kitchen so you could see what exactly they were doing. The free dry roasted peanuts were a nice touch but it seemed a bit odd to wanna dig into any more after our food arrived. I am partial to boiled peanuts too hehe.
The cashier was friendly but yea, it was a bit weird she couldn't answer or ask what type of green peppers they had. I did notice later I got charged for a regular burger when I did order a double. I couldn't be sure if they forgot to charge me the extra or that's how it is there. The size of the burger was decent. The burger patties themselves did seem a bit bland. Cajun fries seemed over seasoned, drowned in the red powder. Regular fries were good, could be a bit crispier, but that's just my preference.
I wasn't exactly blown away. Not sure if I'd prefer it over normal fast food burger 'n fries but maybe I didn't get the best they normally had to offer. Another visit is possible in the future to fully gauge that."}
{"text":"Went here on vacation. This place is really good. Huge burgers. 
My only problem with 5 guys is the price of the burgers. A bacon burger is 5.60. That is with no fries or a drink. The fries cost 2 something and they give you a ton. You could share the fries among three friends. 
Five guys has around 20 different toppings for your burger. Great clean place. This location also has outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Great burgers EVERY SINGLE TIME! We love their Cajun fries and always split a triple burger making the cost well worth it. Love the free peanuts they give you while you wait too. Restaurant has always been clean every time we have gone there."}
{"text":"Great burgers, excellent service and a shovelful of fries...all at a great price. 

What's not to love?"}
{"text":"A little busier than the Fashion Square location, but still great food and good service. 

Love the fries."}
{"text":"Five Guys, the \"Willy Wonka of burgercraft!\"

To continental US folks, Five Guys might not be such a big deal. But, to a guy from a small Hawaii town that has had to suffer through watching commercials for their delicious burgers his whole life without being able to ever taste them, it was a pretty big deal for me.

On a trip that was filled with great food, I was happy to close out my culinary experience in Illinois by hitting up Five Guys with the fam. 

Being that Five Guys is a franchise that's all over the country, I think it's safe to assume that everyone knows what the interior is like, for the most part. Though I will note that this location appeared to be very clean and well-kept.

The staff was also great. For having to deal with a bunch of people who had never eaten at Five Guys before, they were very patient and helpful with helping us order our food. The turnaround time was also quite fast, which I can always appreciate.

Now to the food. Knowing that I wasn't going to get Five Guys again for a while, I had to go all in, and went for a bacon cheeseburger with everything on it; as one does. Man, oh man, that thing was good. The meat was juicy, everything stayed together well, and the cheese was melty. What more could you ask for? I mean, I guess you might want good bacon on the burger. It had that, too! As for the fries, we got some both with and without the cajun seasoning. The plain fries were great. They were just right. The ones with the seasoning on them were also good. I just found that sometimes if one happened to have a ton of seasoning on it, it was a tad bit salty. Still good, though!

Overall, I feel like Five Guys definitely lived up to the hype for me. Two thumbs up to this location and this franchise. For sure try it out if you haven't before!"}
{"text":"Try their \"hot sauce\" on your burger. Good!

This particular five guys is fairly new.  My family likes the fries when they're hot.  The burgers aren't cheap, but they are very good and the toppings selection is also very good.

The drink dispensers are a family favorite.  They love mixing flavors with their Sprite or Coke.

It's a God-awful dirty mess in there with Peanut shells and dirty tables everywhere as they try to keep up.

It's your typical 5 Guys.  if you like them, you won't be disappointed in this one."}
{"text":"Excellent!

This particular Five Guys is very well managed.  The employees are the best I've seen in a fast food restaurant.

Also, it's the first time we've seen the new Soda Machines where you can fine tune your soda.  Diet Cock Raspberry/Vanilla for me!!  Sweet!!

The burgers are the best.  Always eat \"In\" at a Five Guys.  When you take the fries home they cool off and get nasty.  Eat the Fries Hot!!

Burgers were wonderful as always.  Never had a bad Five Guys burger.  Never.

Try the hot sauce sometime on your burger.  It's more like spicy ketchup.  It's not that hot either.  Just spicy.

Try dipping your fries in the Malt Vinegar they offer.  It's a unique taste and something different that ketchup.

We went early on a Saturday morning (11:30) and it had just started to get busy.  We didn't have to wait very long to be knee deep in fries and burgers.

Pure Heaven!!"}
{"text":"Fresh tasty beef available for hamburger lovers. Choose your toppings. Add some tasty imported fries and you got your hungry pains removed in short order. Service is acceptably quick, it does take a few minutes but that's simply because your freshly made burgers are cooked to perfection. A regular for this reviewer, for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Well, it's finally time. I've given this place a few chances in the past, but have never really been that impressed...until now. 
I pass this place every day so I figured I would go in and see if anything was different. I got the little cheeseburger and little fries, and took my meal to go. Service was very friendly and I don't mind that the order took a bit to come because I know it was all made fresh to order. The burger was great, juicy and a nice size, with a non-overpowering sesame seed bun. The fries are totally different now and AMAZING...I don't mind getting a huge bag full of them now! Prices are still rather high ($11.50 for the two items, no drink) BUT much higher satisfaction for my money on this visit.
Very pleased with myself for giving this place another shot. :)"}
{"text":"This is my second review of five guys, simply put, the burgers are bland, the people don't know how to use the POS system for a GIFT CARD. burger falls apart and is dry and under-seasoned. fries are so so. it's loud, it's noisy I have to wait over 25 minutes for a fucking hamburger and fires. not impressed with the quality of the food or the quality of the customer service. never going back, especially as it seems to be part of their training to be rude as hell, slam your drink cup down in front of you and once they're done with one order walk off and have a vape in back (which by the way is ILLEGAL TO DO in a kitchen or food service area) and I really don't appreciate being greeted with \"What you want?\" well not greeted, more barked at. honestly, I don't see how they're still in business here. I guess Americans just don't have taste buds and like getting a crappy burger. wouldn't feed this to my dog or worse enemy, though mind you my dog usually eats better than me. I think from now on, I will avoid you guys like the plague. even if you DO have good classic rock playing. although when you've heard Led Zeppelin's Black Dog for the 8th time in a row, stop, please? really am not impressed with them. and not willing to wait 25 minutes for a burger and fires that are just poured into a paper bag"}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix from Southern California and while exploring the area stumbled on Five Guys.  I was excited because I have friends in Philly that tout this place.  We headed over at about 2 to let the lunch rush die down--we only had 3 people in front of us but the restaurant was about 75% full.  

I ordered the cheeseburger and DH got the bacon cheese burger both \"all the way\".  We each got a small order of fries, mine regular his cajun style.  We were #68, so we got our drinks, sat down and waited (opted out of getting peanuts).  It took less the 5 minutes for our food to be up and boy am I glad we didn't get peanuts.  

The burgers were double pattied with sauted shrooms, onions, pickles, lettuce, tomatoe and ketchup and mustard.  The french fries came in small cups but there were at least that many at the bottom of the bag too....no way we would eat all of those.  Next time 1 small order.  I now also understand what a \"little\" burger is on the menu, it must be one pattie.

The burgers were good, sloppy with all that stuff, but really good flavor.  Glad they were wrapped in foil so I had something to hold it all together with.  The fries were done in peanut oil (I assume).  Not cripsy but I don't think they were supposed to be.  They were good, but the cajun was a bit much.  

The price was reasonable just $20 for two big burgers, 2 fries and 2 drinks.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"So happy that there is a no bun option!
Always had good experiences at 5 Guys. Atmosphere is loud with the rock music playing and usually pretty busy and bright. That being said the burgers are pretty worth it with the toppings deals you get. The cajun fries are great and we always end up taking them home because we can't finish them all (along with bags of peanuts). 

Rating bumped down due to being a little pricey for what is ultimately fast food, although I do like that they don't have freezers and post where their potatoes came from that day."}
{"text":"I'd agree with the comments that say that Five Guys has one of the best fast food burgers in existence ... except for the fact that one of the burgers I bought recently had an actual piece of bone in it.  I bit down on this, badly cracking a tooth in the process.  Two months and multiple dental procedures later, I'm feeling much better, but this wasn't the way I wanted to spend my Christmas season.

Maybe this was a fluke -- I've never experienced this at any of the other Five Guys I've been to -- but it was certainly enough to make sure that I will never come back to this place again."}
{"text":"It's always pretty good the fries are always awesome just the prices bothers me, seems a little pricey for what you get, always clean places"}
{"text":"I just ordered the 'hamburger' then added my favorite toppings.

Another excellent burger, I have to say! Plenty of meat, freshly made - and hot off the grill!

Top notch fries as well, overflowing from the cup they put it in.  It takes about 5 - 10 minutes to get a great, fresh burger like this - but is very much worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Their BLT* described in a short list.

Bacon; thin strips crispy and crunchy
Lettuce; semi crisp
Tomato; ditto

The two later could be due to the warmth of the former and any condiments  slathered on their sweetish sesame seeded bun.

In this case pickles (me like) plus you can add other toppings if you wish.

*a pretty well known acronym, but just in case it's broken down above.

Almost forgot the rock music (me like)."}
{"text":"You know you got a restaurant problem when one thing that people mention about this place is the cool soda machine. I admit they do have some cool soda machine that shoot all kinds of drinks. 

Love their peanuts for free appetisers. But the experience when you dine in there is like dining in the zoo. The staff keep yelling \" two at the door\" as soon as they saw some people in the front door. \"three at the door\", \"look two monkey\", doesnt it makes you feel like you are in the zoo? 

The burger was so-so but I've gotta say, in n out is better although this joint apparently have won all kinds of awards. I would still probably come back just for to go order. Eat in, thats another issue!"}
{"text":"Best place to get a fresh burger within a a reasonable amount of time.  Plus real potato french fries...yum!  Burger is pretty big, so consider a little burger if you plan to get fries too.  All the toppings you want including grilled mushrooms. Oh and  Remember to grab free shelled peanuts on your way out.  Or in."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers on the South Shore of MTL.

Meat is always fresh, never kept frozen and its tasty. You pick whatever you want to add to your single / double pattie. French fries aren't included in the meal though, they come with some spices that are way too salty for me so I ask them separately.

I love the old classics that play in the background. Great ambiance. It adds to the dynamic staff."}
{"text":"Little high priced but so much of such great food. Will definitely go back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, but it's hard to get the cost right when you're eating alone, since the portions are completely wrong for individual diners at lunchtime. The words they use for sizes are very poorly calibrated, with their idea of \"small\" being a normal place's idea of \"large.\" They do this to upsell you to more food than you need.

I'm a guy, 6'3\", and I've got a big appetite, but their \"little\" burgers are definitely adequate for lunchtime. The \"regular\" burgers, by comparison, are the same as the \"little\" burgers, just with two beef patties instead of one. So in other words, it's totally a marketing thing designed to upsell you to more food than you need. \"Little\" is actually \"regular\", and \"regular\" is actually \"extra large.\"

Unfortunately, fries work the same way. The \"regular\" fries are the smallest size on the menu, but they're easily large enough for two people. In other words, the minimum amount of fries you can order is still, in effect, an \"extra large.\"

I guess maybe this is just designed as a group place. So if you're a lone diner, be prepared to buy too much food if you really want to get a burger AND fries. If you get a little burger and a regular fries, it's the equivalent of another place's regular burger and extra large fries.

Overall, three stars, because the food really is very good. It's just a shame they have a deceptive sizing/price structure."}
{"text":"Didn't have to wait long at all, everything was so fresh and delicious. Had to take the fries home after that 2 patti bacon cheeseburger, damn I'm full lol. A little pricey but well worth it"}
{"text":"I love Five Guys.  In California we have In-n-Out and Carl's Jr, which are great burger joints.  In Cleveland, we have Five Guys.  Customize your burger, great fries, and free drink refills.  Excellent customer service.

I am noticing that people from the midwest seem to mix up quality and quantity when doing reviews.  Most will say things are good for the sake of how much they got, but I prefer quality.  That said, you do get tons of fries that taste great due to the peanut oil used.  Also, having free peanuts is fun.  

While I do miss some of my establishments in California, Five Guys definitely is worth the experience and helps fill the void & craving for a good burger.

5/8/11 I was recently informed by my friends in California that there are Five Guys there!  I never knew this, and only recently discovered this chain when coming to the midwest.  I stand corrected; thank you."}
{"text":"My meal was pretty good, but guys...you need to clean up after yourselves. The ketchup dispenser was out of ketchup, and they had had an issue with something spilling water all over the floor that their solution was to just put wet floor signs up. I feel like they should have a mop in the back someplace. This is a hazard, I almost fell on my way to the bathroom. Cmon guys, you can do better."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 71/100***

It has been about 3 years since I last set foot in a Five Guys, now I remember why! Last Saturday we were in the neighborhood and wanted to try somewhere besides our usual places and the kids wanted cheeseburgers, so Five Guys it is. I do not have any complaints in regards to the restaurant itself or the service for that matter. I do have an issue with the quality of the food or I should say the lack there of.

We got there a little after 11 am when they opened, there were about 3 tables occupied already. I stood staring at the menu for a couple of minutes trying to decide what I wanted. I did notice their prices were higher than In n Out but they offered more topping variations so I thought whatever. I opted for the Cheeseburger ($6.89) with grilled mushrooms and onions, A1 sauce on the side. The kids each got their little Cheeseburger ($5.09) Large fries ($5.09) and Large soda ($2.79) All that set us back $26.98, I thought it was quite steep for fast food burgers but hey if they're great, why not. Boy was I wrong!!! That had to be one of the worst burgers I've had, I purposely asked for the A1 sauce on the side so I could taste the burger and not risk over powering it with the sauce. There was no distinction to that burger, no sweetness offered by the grilled onions or the earthiness of the mushroom. Heck I didn't even detect any salt or pepper on the burger! I was not expecting a mind blowing experience for the price but I did expect it to be at least up to par with In n Out or even better, I mean if you're going to charge me $6.89 for a cheeseburger by itself (compared to In n Out Double-double @ $3.20) then I sure would hope it'll taste somewhat decent. For that price I can get a Double-double with fries and a drink at In n Out. The fries have nothing going on for them either. I thought it was cool for them to have peanuts to help yourself with while waiting for your order but even that was just okay, some of the peanuts tasted really stale and old. I just don't see the appeal of this place, needless to say I wont be going back."}
{"text":"I actually knew the founding owners of this franchise.... They started in Alexandria, VA,, but anyways...  Burgers are pretty good..  Fries are just typical boardwalk style fries,, fried in peanut oil...  Little pricey, would rather get a burger at Chili's or RubyTuesday for what they charge...  I would eat here, again if its the only place around.."}
{"text":"I was kinda shocked when a patron dropped their peanut shells on the floor. I need to get used to dropping my garbage on the floor, seems fun.

Ordered a cheeseburger and got a double cheeseburger. $5.95. There is something wrong when a company misrepresents standards to be cute or to pump up sales. That aside my burger was sloppy but good, I ate it all. And I got to tell you, I'm still an In-N-Out fanboy.

Thanks for the free peanuts, pretty good. Good Luck Five Guys!"}
{"text":"Service: Chaos. Seems to have been strong worse over the last year. It's Spring 2016 as I write this. 

Food: Consistent burgers. Generous fry portions. And, you can get it about any way you want it, with a gajillion topping options."}
{"text":"Met my wife there for lunch on a week day.  We got there right as they opened because they fill up pretty fast.  The music inside was way too loud.  Practically had to shout to have a conservation.  The burgers were ok, you could tell the meat was fresh.  If you like Wendy's burgers you'll like this place.  A bit pricey, over $20 for two burgers, one order of fries, (huge serving, feeds 2), and 2 sodas.  Again burgers aren't bad just not worth the price."}
{"text":"Love this place, one of the best things I like is choosing your own toppings.  Tried so much different combinations so it never gets boring.  The patty is not as greasy or fat as the other burger joints but the meat taste is still there.  Service is very good and friendly.

The highlight here is the soda fountain (I know it's unhealthy), you can try all kinds of combinations of drinks ex: lime, raspberry, lemon coke.

Sorry In N Out.. I've moved on to something else."}
{"text":"Fries are the best! There burgers are good too but they are way to greasy. If you dont eat the entire burger very fast the grease runs through the bread and your burger falls apart. I think its because they stack up so much meat into the buns that the grease runs through them. Ive only eaten there twice for this reason."}
{"text":"Still like the burgers here, although things have been going more and more downhill recently.     Noticed that the service has gotten somewhat sloppy and what you order may not necessarily be what you get.      The last two times I've requested BBQ sauce on my burger, I've got an absolutely dry burger with nothing on it, or I've gotten it absolutely coated full of mayo, so BBQ must be some sort of code for \"surprise me.\"       

   Burgers are still pretty decent but if your order keeps getting screwed up, that's not a lot of incentive to keep coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I just walked in this location and walked out once I reached the ordering counter. I was blown away by how LOUD the music was at 12:47pm on 4-4-15. I asked the cashier, \"Why is your music so loud?\" She responded snide-like, \"It's music.\" I work at a Taphouse (no liquor) and our music is never that loud. Five Guys is a step up from Wendy's... I went across the street to Wendy's and enjoyed good food and a calm environment...where I can actually carry a conversation without having to yell. 

I'm NEVER going here again until management can be MANAGEMENT rather than just hold the title."}
{"text":"The bacon cheeseburger was good, nothing spectacular. However, the gentleman that helped me was spectacular. The customer service is what made me stay and eat in the dining room. This particular staff memmber was constanly moving, cleaning, greeting, etc. I would hire him on my team but he left before I was able to talk with him."}
{"text":"Let's see, I will have to give this 3 stars based on fast food burgers in general. 

I have been to Five Guys 4 times now. I first tried it in Alabama, now here in Vegas. What I like most about this place is it's usually very clean, fast/good service and the food is good. 

The best thing in my opinion is the buns. I usually don't like really soft buns, but they are good and they toast the inside. This place is awesome because you can choose whatever you want to put on the burger unlike most places, where you have to ask to have things taken off. The also have fresh beef, never frozen. The patties are very tasty, I just they would come a little more rare. 
A lot of people love the fries, and they are good...but I am a thin fry kind of girl. But they do have malt vinegar to dip your fries in, which is really good. 

If you haven't tried this place yet, you should. If you like In and Out, you'll like this place as well. But oddly enough, I'm not a fan of In and Out."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews but this time I had too . I placed an online order for pickup at 2 , a burger and fries. Very SIMPLE. I get there around 2:07 to give them time to get my order ready . I talk to the cashier to get my order and she said itll be a few min for my fries to get done. AFTER 30 Mins my order still isnt ready and I see people come in and out with their orders . I understand that fastfoods get busy and there might be some waiting. But the staff there were all just standing there, gathered having a full on conversation ! I shouldve taken a picture to reported it to the manager. So I go up to the cashier again and ask how long till my order is ready and she didnt even bothered to ask for my number, all she said was \"it should be ready in a few\" . I kept waiting because I didnt want to make a scene & over exaggerate but after 30 fckn minutes I ask for my money back . It turned out they lost my order !!! They were too busy in the back talking and hanging out that they couldnt even do that one simple order right. Never going back there again !"}
{"text":"This place was way overpriced for the food you get.  With the exception of the fries- they did give us a lot of fries, for a medium order. I found them dry, and strongly tasted of potato skin though.    My son ordered the bacon burger, there was no bacon, and the burger was small for the $6 it cost.  My daughter had the grilled cheese with some toppings, they left off the tomato (her favorite part).  Yes, I could have gone up and asked them to correct the order, but they were super busy and it took forever to get our food in the first place.   My husband got the blt.  Nothing special about it. I got the regular single patty burger, just ok.  My family and I agreed that we won't go back.  We actually prefer other fast food burger places that give you more for your money."}
{"text":"A COCK ROACH!! Okay this would have been a 4 star rating  BUT once I finished having a great \"real beef\" bacon burger with fries that were slightly soggy, (which my daughter says they are always that way) I like my fries a little more crisp. I was pretty pleased with the food and the service the staff was very nice the food was flavorful and hot. Then I happen to look down and there a huge cock roach crawling on the floor! I thought I was going to give them back their meal! Ugggg!!! I told a worker and he was pleasant and ask manager what to do then went and pick it up and took outside and killed it. I HOPE this was a unusual incident and they don't have a big bug issue. I will not be going back for a while if at all, I'm afraid my mind would get the best of me while trying to enjoy a burger."}
{"text":"Five guys is just more of a generic expensive fast food burger. 

The fries are good and you do get a good amount but the burger itself is nothing to write home about. Best case, slightly better than wendys. 

Really though, no where close to burgers priest which is across the street."}
{"text":"Love five guys! From the area it was born though so maybe I'm biased. 

Burgers are delicious - love all the various toppings. Fries are so crispy. Portions are huge.

Most days I'd recommend a little burger (1 Patty not 2) and little fries but if you're hungry, do the regular burger. I'd still do the little fries since the normal is a collassal amount.

Always great service and an awesome meal."}
{"text":"Second time here and will be last. Was mid evening 815 or so and though I would try again after a poor visit the first time.  Only 2 people behind the counter, a 3rd sitting in the dining area sucking on a coke. Two people were waiting for orders and we had to wait a couple minutes to even order our food. One employee was going as fast as she could to make everything, the other appeared to be working in slow motion. The third disappeared from the dining room, never to be seen again. Order taken, 3 more groups walk in behind us after we sit and wait for a few minutes. Better part of 10 minutes later, we get our food the same time as the groups behind us. Now 15 min after we arrive our burgers are lukewarm and the fries had a marginally crispy outer with a mushy center.  Save yourself the time and money, there are better, faster places within a minutes drive."}
{"text":"OMG. This burger joint replaced every other burger place in Las Vegas. I love how it gives u unlimited toppings, Juicy Burgers everytime, shoot don't let me get started on the Cajun fries. I love this place. Customer services great."}
{"text":"Please stop employing trashy, lazy employees that show they do not want to be working. Had a awful experience with the night shift workers. Employees tried making customers uncomfortable by blasting vulgar music \"8/26/16 roughly around 9:50pm.\" so we would leave. They should try working at McDonald's next time. Way to ruin a great burger spot in Summerlin. Will be also contacting corporate ASAP."}
{"text":"I moved here from the DC area back in 2010 and was excited to find that Five Guys franchises were making their way out West to AZ. and beyond.   We have been to this location many times over the years, but last week was the most disappointing experience we've ever had at a Five Guys.  

First, the place looked like it had been hit by a tornado inside.  The tables were all filthy and the dining area in disarray.  Used napkins, salt, ketchup, peanuts, and more were everywhere.  The condiment area was out of straws and other supplies.  

It took a long time for our order to be made, and we saw one guy take frequent smoke breaks even when there were customers in line.

The food was not like we remembered.  Burgers were dry and small and fries were cold and not fresh.  

We were really hoping for a good Fives Guys experience but will not go back to *this* one soon.  :("}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The employees are fantastic. Destiny is always so happy and helpful at the register and she makes the experience even better."}
{"text":"Tr√®s bon Burger classique de vieux Diner. Ils mettent comme d√©co sur les murs: Best 4$ burger in town. C'est de la fausse repr√©sentation parce que ce n'est pas aussi peu dispendieux que √ßa. Mais dans l'ensemble, excellent, et service rapide quand il y a une ligne sinon un peu lent quand il n'y a pas de ligne."}
{"text":"The food took way too long, was greasy and not worth the inflated price.  Very disappointed because I had heard great things about Five Guys."}
{"text":"Rude employees had terrible attitudes for no reason. Rolling their eyes and muttering under their breath."}
{"text":"Always delish & no one judges me for asking for relish in my little bacon cheeseburger!"}
{"text":"Overrated and overpriced burger joint. The way they prep and package the burgers makes for a very gooey result. I love the Cajun fries, but the burgers have never impressed me. The relative high price -compared to say... Inn n Out, whose sandwiches I favor- is enough to stay away. If you're going to drop over $10 for a burger & fries, go to Red Robin or Chilis."}
{"text":"Convenient location, right in the parking lot of the LV Premium Outlet south.  Traveling from Hawaii, most of us will do shopping along with the gambling fool thing.  We did a quick lunch break before heading back downtown.  The burger was excellent, little one being sufficient (1 patty) with added toppings to our preference (mushrooms, onions...).  The fries were excellent, they even list the area and farmer from which the potatoes originated.  Had some dry roasted peanuts while we waited, didn't know what that was about until we saw others scooping up and cracking open Mr. Peanut.  The soda machine was a kick, nothing like that in Hawaii.  Computerized to produce whatever combination you want.  We actually had to wait while it rebooted after maintenance.  Somebody in Hawaii has to ante up and get one of these babies.   I opted for Coke Zero with lemon while my daughter had Ginger Ale with orange.  Hard to say after only one visit but,.... better than In & Out?  Goinna' try Smashburger next, right down the row of fast food places in the same parking lot."}
{"text":"I'll take a side of burger with my order of grease...

I want all you yelpers out there to know that before I have a heart attack from eating at Five Guys that it's been fun, I had some great reviews, I don't think I'm gonna make it and I love you all... goodbye."}
{"text":"The first thing I think of when I remember our trip to Five Guys is \"loud\". It's not really the music or the customers either, it's the employees working in the kitchen hollering back and forth.

Getting to the food... it's good, not out of this world. I'd rather make a burger on the grill at home. Their fries are the real selling point for me, very tasty!

Oh and I love those pop machines, very fun...just don't get stuck behind a group of people who have never seen one before...you'll be waiting forever."}
{"text":"Out in Rock Hill looking for a pet friendly patio and a good lunch. We called a few places and unfortunately they did not allow pets. Five guys not only did, their response was quite possibly one of my favs....\"we allow pets on patio as long as they don't smoke\"   

Burgers and fries are always good but made even better by sharing with our furry children on the patio."}
{"text":"Good place if you're in the area, the patties are not more than OK to be honest, but very good variety of toppings. Would give them another chance for when I'll be in the area."}
{"text":"One of the greasiest burgers in Montreal!

Apparently this place is touted as having one of the best burgers but I say it has one of the greasiest burgers! 

Five Guys not worth a repeat visit unless I was drunk or something."}
{"text":"Reviews made me a little nervous about this location but my experience was great. I walked in and was greeted. Order taken and was given my drink cups and number. Waited maybe 10 mins. Got 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 drinks, about $25. Food made fresh. Fries tasted good. Not too greasy or underdone like some other comments. Didn't notice any health code violation stuff. As I was leaving guy behind counter stopped me to give me a drink carrier and apologized for not doing so earlier. Was very happy with my food and the experience. Would go here again."}
{"text":"Four stars because I'd feel bad about myself  if I gave it five. That said, a Five Guys burger is always perfect in my book. Arguably, I rarely remember much of the experience, but if my late night burger beacon automatically sets itself towards this destination, it must mean that they're doing something right."}
{"text":"Akron is a burger town. Swenson's and Skyway rule the night for anyone hungry. Burgers here are like those crazy Chicago hotdogs or the thin folding pizza in NYC.

So, I was skeptical when this national chain showed up an eigth of a mile from the 'secret' Swensons tucked back on the other side of the street. Another gimmick: giant burgers with unlimited toppings and fresh cut fries. People yelling orders. Everyone being hustled through to make room for the next customers.

I went with my friends and it was pretty good. First the bad: you have to know what you want before you even go through the door. The gimmick is that its so good you have to hurry up. But then you order like you're at skyway. A  couple of burgers, some fries and a coke. You shuffle along and get your bag of food. WTF? It weighs six pounds. You realize that a Five guys burger is gigantic and loaded with everything good. Mushrooms, onions on and on. Its like a fast food garbage burger from Max and Erma's. You have enough food to eat for a week.

It might not be as good or as Akronish as Swenson's but if you're really really hungry this place will put you to bed.

If you like those county fair fries with the skins on them, you'll like the fries here. If you'd rather have those perfection fries from Swenson's skip the five guys fries. Youy won't need them. You're gonna do about 4500 calories on the first burger alone. Burp."}
{"text":"Best customer service ever!!! Every single time I passed an employee I was greeted and asked if I needed anything.   Even a drink refill. I've only come here in the day time.  But it's on point"}
{"text":"I love this place. First time I went it was actually because a family's son worked there and we all headed out.
Burger. Heaven.
Been there plenty of times since, and they never disappoint. Big juicy sloppy full of extras and add-on burgers that are mouth watering good. My 9 year old loves the fries...and he doesn't usually like fries!
This place has taken a simple menu to the next level awesome food."}
{"text":"Great place to stop with a couple hungry boys after a soccer match. Great burgers, fries and drinks. We love 5 Guys!"}
{"text":"First time going to any Five Guys and I have to say it is a little overrated. Perhaps because I have several friends say it is the best thing that happen to hamburgers since they were invented so it is hard to live up to that standard. Don't get me wrong, the burger was super, but the fries were a little dry and it was about twice as much as most other fast food places. 

This particular location was very friendly and happy to serve. Because I was on my phone, they went out of their way to take my food to my table without any fuss. Got to love that service!"}
{"text":"Never really liked this chain that much. They burgers are great but the price is high and you get some sort of fast food like service. The fries and drinks are crazy expensive."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5
This place is located on Hwy 7 and Birchmount Rd near Whole Foods Supermarket. There were ample spots I never had an issue with parking at this plaza. 

[SERVICE] - 3/5
Average. Usually takes a little longer to make the food, but there are peanuts if you want to munch on them you wait for your order. 

[D√âCOR] - 4/5 
Lot of tables, clean, and I love the retro vibes at every Five Guys location. 

[QUALITY] - 3/5
Beef patty was high-quality, but not juicy enough in my opinion. Toppings were fresh & the bun was toasted quite well.

[ORDER] - 3/5
Cheeseburger - $10.79: beef patty could have been juicier, but personally, this was not worth the price 

Cajun Fries - $4.55: perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. That cajun seasoning has the perfect amount of spice and savouriness. 

[OVERALL] - 3/5
Personally, not my favourite burger chain, but their Cajun fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"Five Guys serves up much better than average fast food burgers, but if you grew up on In-N-Out you'll still be an In-N-Out fan after visiting Five Guys.  I suspect if your from the East and grew up on Five Guys, you still prefer them to In-N-Out.  That being said, the two burger joints are on par with each other.  I prefer the fries at In-N-Out, but like the topping selection at Five Guys better (no secret menu required)."}
{"text":"Another solid fast food burger.

I like the concept of building your own burger, and take advantage of it!

Burgers are large...I order the baby size due to this fact, single pattys.  These are still about a 1/4lb I believe...

Fries come out in HUGE portions.  I order one for two people.  Seriously, they fill the cup of fries to the top, and then dump another cup on top and into the bottom of the bag.  They are very generous....  Defintely try the \"cajun fries\" if you like a little spice (not hot) although towards the end of the meal, they feel a little too salty for my tastes, but are still very good.

They also have complimentary peanuts that you can have as a starter...gets the palate ready for their peanut oil cooking.

Great FF burger!"}
{"text":"Great burgers at good prices.  Not my favorite burger in town, but one of my most favorite fast food chain burger spots.

The \"little\" burgers are usually enough to fill me up, but if you have a larger appetite, their regular sizes are double patties.

Everything is cooked fresh in an open kitchen, so the smells are great when you first walk in.

Try their cajun fries if you like salty goodness.  They are really really salted and spiced (hot spicy), so I do a french fry shake or two to get most of it off before I eat it, but they are much better tasting than the reg fry.

Also cool how they serve peanuts for all their guests...just a little bonus for coming here.  Give it a go :)"}
{"text":"If I'm going \"fat boy\" for lunch and a burger is my weapon of choice, it has to be Five Guys.  McDonald's, BK, Wendy's, In & Out, Smashburger just leave me wanting more.  If I'm throwing calories to the wind, Five Guys and Fries is my 1st choice.  I recommend not to dine alone because an order of fries can be daunting for even the hearty of appetites."}
{"text":"Good burger + loud + need mops

Love us some Five Guys.  Staff was cool, burgers and fries were good as usual.

The cons were the cleanliness, the volume, and the wait.  Floors were sticky, the tables required some wiping before we could use any of them, and the soda machine was gooey.  The volume was blaring, leading to the kids covering their ears.  And it took about 15 minutes to get three meals up with only average traffic."}
{"text":"Mmmm burger + fries...

Am a fan of 5 Guys.  Simple menu, good burger, and it's cool how the fries come from potato farms from different regions of the US each week.  It's like I'm a connoisseur of fries.  You can also malt vinegar them!

Service is almost always friendly.  It can be hard to get a table and there is a line that often goes out the door if it's anywhere near lunch or dinner.

And not at all healthy.  Just uber yum."}
{"text":"If I could give this burger joint 2 1/2 stars I would. Mixed experience at its' best.
 I was shocked at how sparse the menu was- NO  salads, onion rings, baked potatoes or shakes or.. anything else.. but mainly burger, fries and hot dogs. Everythjing in blinding red and white colors.
  Um ok... So we ordered. We liked how the toppings were free and that they had ones we actually liked. 
The order was for three: One bacon burger got a 10 out of a 10 rating and some love. The other two, a 5 out of 10. To me ( Yeah I was a 5..) it was just a good greasy burger. I expected much more, something to give it a wow factor. There needed to be a  \"You couldn't make this at home if you tried\" factor... but there was none.
 The fries were just cut friend potato with some salt . ( Again nothing you can't make at home). No one liked the fries especially. They were passable but nothing to go on about and the large is about 5 bucks, it will feed a lot of people but who needs that many fries??! The President of fried food addicts are us???!!
 The Peanuts, I totally don't get it. They just want you to buy a drink.
 The drink machines rock! I loved these and was like a kid in the candy store. I regressed to about 10 years old and became giddy with the choices of so many of my faves. And if you can't have sugar there are choices for you too besides Diet coke and unsweetened tea like most places have.
 The lighting is  too bright and it's so noisy our nerves were shot leaving the place. I would not go back again unless someone else wanted to go. You pay a lot for decent food that really could be made at home. If you want a huge artery clogging lunch to perk up your dreary work day go fit but be prepared to spend a lot and do some sit ups afterwards. :) This place will fit the bill for most burger enthusiasts, but it wasn't for me, I am not a fries person either..."}
{"text":"It took me awhile to choose what my first Yelp review would be upon my return to the lovely land of Cleves, and then it hit me like a giant, juicy, cheesy burger of goodness...

Five Guys Famous Burgers and Fries.

I first encountered Five Guys in Atlanta, so it's fitting that it's my crossover review... and man, is Cleveland lucky that they've arrived!  I was so happy to walk through the door of the new location at the Strongsville mall.  

These Guys are amazing.  The menu is simple: you can order a regular burger or cheeseburger (2 patties) or a \"little\" burger or cheeseburger, all available with bacon, if desired.  That's it.  From there, you order your toppings (which are FREE, no matter WHAT you choose), and perhaps grab a drink and some fries.

Perhaps?  Let me rephrase that: you BEST get some fries, because they're REAL fries, not those over-processed sticks you get from fast food places.  They're also cooked in peanut oil, so kudos for no cholesterol.  You can get the regular, Five Guys style fries, or Cajun fries, which I have yet to try but will surely sample on my next visit.  Which might be in about five minutes, because I'm making myself hungry.  Never too early for a burger, right?

Ah, back to the burgers.

Five Guys' motto is \"Fresh, never frozen\", and man, you can taste it.  The burgers are juicy and full of flavor, and the toppings are fresh and plentiful.  Mouth-watering, I tell ya.  NOTE: you are GOING to get messy with all the juicy-condiment-fantasticness, so just accept it and enjoy.  Trust me, it's worth it.

The restaurant is as laid-back as the menu, just a simple setup of chairs at tables and counters with a red-and-white-checked decor.  Kind of an old-school burger joint feel without foraying into throwback 50's kitschy-ness.  (Though I'm not knocking a true 50's diner, don't get me wrong - but that's another review.)

Basically, with the satisfying flavors, reasonable prices, and simple but comfy atmosphere, I never want to eat fast food burgers again - give me Five Guys Burgers and Fries any day!  Welcome to Cleveland!

(And how many burger joints do you know of that are Zagat rated?  Word.)"}
{"text":"I really like Five Guys hamburgers. However I don't like them enough to go all the time. I think Smash Burger and more critically \"The Habit\" is far tastier. NOW I am not going to spend time knocking these guys. Here's my BEEF (ha ha) with Five Guys:

Their hamburgers are WAY too messy... they need to provide forks and knives to the customers and they need to have a salad option. This is what I love about The Habit.

The fries are quite good, but PLEASE crinkle cut them!
The burgers are good but... I'm not sure there is something about them that while it tastes \"burger-ey\" it doesn't make me crave them like I might something more substantial like the burger at The Capital Grill or STACK which is the best burger I've ever had.

I love the fancy coke machines, but that isn't a reason to go to Five Guys.

I've been three times now... twice on my own and once to take people who have never been and wanted to try it.

My feeling is this:

I don't crave it, and it's not bad.

PS the hawt dog is better than the burger


Me gusta mucho Five Guys hamburguesas. Sin embargo no me gusta lo suficiente como para ir todo el tiempo. Creo hamburguesa Smash y m√°s cr√≠tica \"The Habit\" es mucho m√°s sabroso. Ahora no voy a gastar tiempo llamando a estos tipos. Aqu√≠ est√° mi BEEF (ha ha) con el Five Guys:

Sus hamburguesas son demasiado desordenado ... que necesitan para proporcionar tenedores y cuchillos a los clientes y que necesitan para tener una opci√≥n de ensalada. Esto es lo que me gusta de The Habit.

Las patatas fritas son bastante buenos, pero POR FAVOR, corte ondulado de ellos!
Las hamburguesas son buenos, pero ... No estoy seguro de que hay algo en ellos que, si bien su sabor \"burger-ey\" no me hace anhelar ellos como si yo pudiera algo m√°s sustancial como la hamburguesa en The Capital Grill o pila, que es la mejor hamburguesa que he tenido.

Me encantan las m√°quinas de fantas√≠a coque, pero eso no es una raz√≥n para ir a Five Guys.

He estado ya tres veces ... dos veces por mi cuenta y una vez para llevar a las personas que nunca han estado y quer√≠a probarlo.

Mi opini√≥n es la siguiente:

No me antoja, y no es malo.

PS el perro hawt es mejor que la hamburguesa"}
{"text":"Went on Sunday and it was super busy but they handled it!! The girl at the front was so polite and patient. This store can really handle a rush. Completely satisfied guest."}
{"text":"Great quick stop for keto lifestyle. They will gladly put it in a bowl for you.  An extra patty, on top of the two it comes with, is only $2.00. You can also get extra cheese, and extra bacon (free of charge, judging by my receipt). 
If you prefer your burger wrapped in lettuce, get there early.  They use about half a head of lettuce.  If it is toward the end of the day, they won't do it, as it means not having enough lettuce left. 
Always, hot, fresh, and great for the price you pay"}
{"text":"I dig the chain.  This place is no exception.  The staff is friendly.  The service is quick.  The restaurant is clean.  The burgers and fries are delicious."}
{"text":"Five Guys locations all over the \"Burgh are consistently clean, super friendly, and delicious.  It's not the cheapest place to feed a family, but the burgers are worth it.  I dig the tunes and the vibe."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place?  The burger I ordered was a double patty one with cheese and my favorite toppings. Each patty is 3.5 oz so one was too few and two really hit the spot!  I passed on the fries but ordered a cola and the bill came to $12.50. This was more than I thought I wanted to pay but in the end it's not so bad. 

The burger was delicious and filling which left me feeling full and happy.  If you're looking for a place for a family meal be prepared to pay restaurant prices without restaurant service. I give it a 4/5 stars and would have given it 5 if it were comparable in price to the other fast food burger joints. 

I'll be back, just not soon."}
{"text":"They've really turned this place into a loud over-crowded assembly line.  Who was the greedy little genius who tore out all the seating?  I hate going in there now.
ALSO: I'm a CUSTOMER DON'T YELL AT ME!!!"}
{"text":"Ok.....Here it is from the girl who is VERY picky and can usually find problems with quality or price of food....

Went to Five Guys for the first time....

I am proud to say I could not find ANYTHING that could have been improved on!

I got what they call a small cheeseburger....it was 1/4 pd juicy and yummy tasting burger and quite ample!

You get to pick any of the toppings you want....impressive.....

They used the perfect amount of condiments giving the burger an evenly tasty bite every time.

The fries were awesome....we also tried cacun fries which added a nice bite.

I felt the price was reasonable and definately worth it!

For me to find this burger near perfect is rare....very rare.... I HIGHLY reccomend you check Five Guys out!"}
{"text":"Best Fast Food Burger in town!!! I go here with co-workers probably too often, but it is to good to pass up. At lunch time this place is hoppin.  Check out the cool new Coke A Cola machines you can get raspberry Sprite!!!!. Ok back to the burgers, actually burgers and dogs.. I dont' eat the dogs but I have only heard good things. The burger comes with everything and I mean everything so look at the menu and only state omissions from the toppings offerings. The Mini burger will fill you just fine and a small order of fresh fries are plenty for two people. These fries are just as good if not better then in and out!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger I ever had.  Don't mess around waisting time at other burger spots, if you are in need of a burger fix then this is where to go."}
{"text":"First thing you see when you go in is a lot of people, then the barrel of peanuts everywhere. I thought they were some kind of decoration until I seen people with them on the plates. 

Burgers and peanuts? Werid but awesome lol. 

So they bagged our food even though we were dining in. I look in the bag, and the fries are everywhere, and I can't even find the burgers! As I am looking for the burgers at the bottom of the bag, I find a small carton with a few fries in it. I think that was a pretty good deal to pay three bucks for fries, and they filled the bag up with them lol.
I did not finish all those fries. I just had a simple hamburger and it was pretty small patty for almost six bucks. I like the idea of choosing toppings for free though. 

Another cool thing was the soda machine. It was pretty fun, to have so many choices and all computer. 

I will return and very likely choose more toppings."}
{"text":"Wow. Major overload of food here. Even the regular fries is an amazingly huge size. Granted, they are fries that have seen potatoes very recently, which equals fresh. Too much salt though. And, as a guy, no way I can go in and order one of the \"little\" burgers; that's what the ladies at my table ordered. So, it's gotta be the double cheese, with bacon (of course), with everything. Only problem was, I couldn't seem to figure out their newfangled soda machine. I tried to get a cherry vanilla Coke, but it came out tasting like regular Coke. Oh well, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Welcome to 5 guys!!  Haha people who are new to Five Guys tend to be impressed. It's a lot of food but be careful, the prices add up! 

A couple of helpful menu tips:

The regular burgers (cheeseburger, bacon burger, hamburger etc) have 2 patties. If you want 1 patty, get the JR ones. 

Yes, the toppings in red are all free! They're you're standard toppings (lettuce, mayo, onions, tomato, mushrooms etc) so don't be shy!!

Ahh the French fries. I, personally, love the Cajun fries. They're not going to burn your tongue right off but they do have a kick! If you want the seasoning on the side they can do that. Or ask for a taste! They'll give you one. 

Fries again. The regular size will feed about 2-3 people. You get a LOT! So be mindful!

This location in particular is always friendly, fast, and clean. They make all your food (fries too!) to order so it's always hot and fresh! It's in a good area but parking can be a bit of a pain because it's in a kind of strip. 

It's a little hard to see from the road but aim for Old Navy/David's Bridal and it's sitting there nestled next to Game Stop.

Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I went here was for their pop machine. You get to choose your standard coke products AND THEN...... you get to choose flavors to add to it. Awesome!"}
{"text":"For me the burger was really just average, nothing special at all. I would never go there again for a burger but their fries were delicious."}
{"text":"Normally a fantastic experience until tonight.  We ordered food to go and the fries had WAY TOO MUCH salt on them. Totally ruined the meal and disappointed!  Will be back but will definitely check the food before we leave."}
{"text":"Probably not the cleanest place in town, but not unbearably dirty either. The food, however, is great. The bacon cheeseburger I ordered was excellent. The \"regular\" order of fries was very generous and among the best fries I've ever had. 

And the free peanuts they had out was a very nice touch."}

{"text":"Good news: ALL toppings incl. grilled mushrooms, jalape√±o peppers, green peppers, grilled onions, onions free (except cheese & bacon, natch). Nitpicks: Package design issues & lack of menu info: Why put large fries in a tall narrow \"milkshake\"cardboard cup, so it tips over all the time & is hard to share? The fries cup spilled all over the thin paper bag it came in, even before we started eating. Why put the free peanuts (a nice touch) in a tiny cardboard tray, so a mess of peanut shells goes all over the table & my clothes? How about a bowl or bucket for the peanut shells mess? My cheese & bacon Burger & large Cajun fries (shared with 2 other people) very good & fresh and service quick & enthusiastic.  Regular size burger turns out to be a double burger (wish the menu explained that) so if you're not ravenous, choose small burger. Fries come in Cajun or Five Guys Style (what's that, Menu?) More info on the menu please! It's more important to customers to know whether they're getting a double burger listed as regular and what toppings you're putting on the burger than where the potatoes were sourced today."}
{"text":"Methinks The Cosmic Trickster is trying to get me to reconsider my dining habits and my obsession with burgers. 

It was my turn to pick, and I had no idea where to go eat this afternoon, so since I had been wanting to try FGBF, we came here after a convoluted search. 

You get in line, order at one counter, wait for your number, and go to another counter to get your food in a grease-stained bag with a bunch of suburbanites for whom this is a Sunday treat.

Kay was immediately disgusted before we even sat down, and I joined her in disgust after eating my burger. 

My bacon cheeseburger was had \"all the way,\" meaning it came with ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, onions, tomato, lettuce, pickle, and grilled mushrooms. 

Y'all know how I love a sloppy, obnoxious, sacrilegious, knock-down, drag-out Lights Out match with my meals. I mean, I have partaken in Primanti Brothers, Vincent's Pizza Park, etc. This however just made me close to feeling sick. 

Not that it wasn't a decent burger. It was adequately juicy, fat, and easily beats down The Clown's burgers while wearing a straitjacket, but I've honestly had even better burgers at Eat 'N Park or King's, and none of them are as sodden and smashed as these. I don't even understand why they bag everything if you're dining in. It's wasteful and makes no sense. 

Ahhh, I see why they give you a bag. The fries spill out of the cup and all over the bottom! Hell, why even put them into a cup at all? 

I think the fries was where I hit rock bottom. Laden with oil, half of them had the crispness I look for, others came off as merely blanched, all of them suffered from peanut fat that was in desperate need of being changed. That dark brown color doesn't lie. 

I also had a Kosher hot dog and found that it was, well... halfway Kosher. This was certainly a premium frank and not Oscar Meyer, but after wading through the deleterious burger and fries, I just couldn't enjoy it. 

There are no desserts (thank God?), but they do have two of those gimmicky, new self-serve soda fountains with 100 flavors. 

Five Guys will make you die. It it the equivalent of an edgy artist finally pissing you off for good. It is ugly. It crosses that line. It is too much of a thing that is good to you but not for you.  Nonetheless, this is slightly above average fast food, so 3 stars it gets. 

P.S. Yes, I know this isn't health food, and Lord knows I'm not a plant fanatic, but none of my favorite burger joints ever made me feel like Five Guys did, and I arrived with an empty stomach. To the Bestiary this ain't goin'.

P.P.S. Our bill for two burgers, two hot dogs (Kay couldn't bring herself to finish hers), a large order of fries for us to share, and two beverages cost us almost $31!!!! One could get twice as much food at half the price at any Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe, and guess what? It's better! Hell, not even The Redhead has filled me with such self-loathing."}
{"text":"A good place to get some greasy burgers! They have big bins full of peanuts for patrons to eat for free. The positives: The burgers are made to order with lots of possible add ons. The burgers are tasty; and are about the same size as a big mac (if you pick the smaller burger). If you order the fries, you get a ton of them. They also have vinegar for folks that like vinegar on their fries. The negatives: the food is INSANELY greasy. Yes I know its a burger joint, but it isn't a good sign when the brown paper bag they give your food in is about to break away from the grease. It is kind of pricey for being a burger joint. The peanuts are great but during busy hours they go everywhere. Still, if you're in the mood for a good greasy burger that isn't from burger king I would go here."}
{"text":"We tried the Five Guys chain in Florida last year.  I thought it was alright.  Decided to give the Etobicoke location a try on one of those nights where everyone was hungry, couldn't decide on what to eat and ended up at the closest possible restaurant.

I ordered the Little Cheeseburger ($5.89), a drink ($2.19) and a side of fries ($3.99).  

Food came quickly but about two bites in, I started to notice how cold it was in the restaurant.  It was freezing...the fries cooled quickly.  Half way through our meal, we were shivering and our nose was running.  Not sure if the AC was still on or if there was no heat.  It was just super cold.  I noticed other patrons eating with their jackets on.  I should have done the same.

Burger was just okay...it got cold really fast thanks to the frigid temperature in the place.  If we eat here again, I'll be sure to bring my eating parka."}
{"text":"One star because I have to give  a star.  Nothing exceptional and maybe the most overrated franchise in the history of fast food.  Stupid concept for greasy cheap food.  In summary, they should have stayed on the east coast.  Prison food has more charm."}
{"text":"Normally, I have nothing bad to say and have an amazing meal everyone. However, had to write a review today for this location after a bad experience and me making the mistake of not telling the employees. It was lunch hour but not overwhelmingly busy. There was a while break between patrons being called for their food and ours, so I was thinking it would be super fresh. First thing I noticed was the cheese wasn't melted at all, but wasn't a huge deal. Both our burgers weren't hot at all, nor the fries (which we were REALLY skimped out on). I did not order mustard and it was on it, again I just decided to deal with it. Right at our last bites, we realized the bacon we ordered for our burger wasn't there either! We were just so hungry we didn't even realize but I should've had it taken back. I wanted to complain but figured it was worthless as we had finished it (although not very happily). Just a terrible experience unfortunately. Won't stop be from visiting, but may not this location again."}
{"text":"I was really craving a burger and fries for lunch so I thought why not try Five Guys after hearing so much about it.  I ordered a cheeseburger, fries and drink and ended up paying almost $16 which is way overpriced if you ask me.  The food was good but it did not justify the price.  I was also surprised to receive a double cheeseburger when all I asked for was a cheeseburger.  I could easily have eaten a double hamburger had there been no fries but it was too much given what else I ordered.

I will say I was impressed by the burger.  The burger was freshly prepared and the patty was juicy and clearly freshly prepared.  I had onions, lettuce, BBQ sauce, pickles, tomatoes, relish and mustard so in other words your run of the mill toppings.  The fries were nice and salty but I have had better.

In all I'm not sure I'd go back to this place again because while the food was good the price was a turn off.  There are a few places downtown that offer a good alternative to the usual food court fare for a reasonable place and I don't think 5 Guys is one of them."}
{"text":"Solid burgers and fries! Very good value. Fast and friendly service. I usually go with the Bacon Cheeseburger, with everything, minus grilled mushrooms. And a regular size Cajun fry. A regular fry is really enough for two people. Unless you're super fat. Or a pig, like me. :)"}
{"text":"I love Five Guys burgers, they always make my order very well. I like the online order system and use it very often. Burgers are consistently delicious and the people working are usually very nice and fast on my orders.
I order from the Flamingo location all the time!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers and fries. Their burgers are huge so we normally get little burgers and regular fries. One time we ordered large fries and it was basically the whole bag so we learned our lesson. This is our local go to burger place. I think it's even better than In N Out."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Five Guys we have ever been to. Just kids goofing around in the kitchen and they didn't seem to care. We ordered to go and once we got home and open the bag, every content in the bag was covered in salt. There was so much salt on the fries that it got all over the bag. It look like they took a big scoop of salt and poured over the top. Fries were sooooo salty and we had to toss it out. My hands were covered in salt after trying to get the burgers out of the bag. What are they doing? Try to kill their customers with SODIUM POISONING? We will never return here."}
{"text":"Went for my Dad's birthday.

Casual, cafeteria-style setting was a nice change from our usual restaurant, line-ups experience.

Regular burger was filling with a huge selection of toppings (at no extra charge), complete with a toasted bun. We (family of 5) also had two large orders of their cajun fries. YUM. We heard the servings were supposed to be HUGE so we only got two but we could've had more. But then again, we love our fries. And free refills!"}
{"text":"This In-N-Out wannabe is not worth the money.  No specials so you have to buy the burger, fries and drink separtely.  Food was not worth the $12 you end up paying.  They DO give you a lot of fries, but quantity is not worth the quality...greasy and soggy.  
They also don't tell you their burger is a double burger.  That would've been nice to know and I would've ordered a \"little burger\".
Will NEVER go back."}

{"text":"I have found the food and service in this store to be excellent on every visit. On our last visit Angelica took a few minutes to dialogue with us about Five Guys, and discuss our guest experience during our current visit. It was great to meet someone who is passionate and dedicated to customer service! Thanks Angelica"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are great. They usually have a clean dining room and restrooms. The overall service at this location is very inconsistent. They could use better management to oversee the service."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, and the service is spectacular. Greeted and order taken by Ashley, very outgoing and a good addition the the Five Guys staff. The management seem to be outgoing and greeted us at our table to check on our visit.

This is definitely a spot I will visit often. Love the friendly service."}
{"text":"Great food. Great friendly service. Prices are higher than necessary. I would like to see a smaller option for the fries. The small is way too large for 3 people. The coke fountain is the best!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and great service. I'm still not a big fan of the fries, they are either soggy or overlooked (if I ask for crispy). The service and friendliness in this store are over the top on this visit."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite spots! Fries need to be cooked more crispy. I really like the new soda fountain- coke! My brother introduced me to this chain on the east coast."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place four stars. Greg would string me up by my toenails and make me repent for my burger sins if he knew I was reviewing his favorite place as just a three star burger joint. But I can't abide paying ten to twelve bucks for a fast food burger, fries and a drink. That's crazy cakes. 

Granted the burger is juicy perfection, grilled to order with as many custom toppings as your hardening arteries can handle. They have two in particular that get me salivating every time: grilled mushrooms and onions. That alone should warrant a fourth star, especially since they don't cost an extra couple bucks a pop like most places. But it's still a six freakin' dollar burger. If they hadn't plastered their walls with newspaper reviews exalting how cheap their eats were, I would probably be a bit more accommodating, but more than ten bucks for a fast foodie burger meal just ain't on.

I do also like that they offer a mini version of their two patty big madre burger, for the wimps like me out there. Regardless, I would recommend keeping the foil around your burger and peeling it away like the burritos from Chipoodle. This will guarantee that all those slippery little grilled mushroom and onion tidbits stay in place, because they're seriously too good to get away. 

The french fries are also in the style that I like, freshly fried up with the bejeezus salted out of them. Ten billion times better than the fresh but somehow still super bland and lifeless matchsticks that In & Out serves. The Cajun style fries are just sprinkled with seasoned salt. A bit of a let down from what I was expecting but a nice change in pace since it's usually curly fries that get the seasoned salt treatment. Also if you're a limey barstard like me you can grab a bottle of malt vinegar from the side counter and use it to drown your fries. So good.

I also dig on the free peanuts. I realize this is a polarizing issue considering the risk of nut allergies out there, but I like it. When I was a kid I used to judge the caliber of an establishment by whether or not I could throw peanut shells on the ground. Sadly, that has changed very little with the years because I still get a kick out of doing it. 

Alright. I've talked myself into it. It's getting an extra star. Damn your scrumptious fare, Five Guys. Your hypnotic grease has me entranced."}
{"text":"Have you tried the Five Guys diet? 

I joke with you. I have nothing unique to offer here. Five Guys provides well seasoned burgers and fries on a consistent basis. If you've been living under a rock and have never been to a Five Guys before, you should know that the \"Little\" burger is actually regular size. By little they mean one patty instead of two. They also always put fries in the bag in addition to what's in your cup. So the bag will be greasy. Five Guys has increased its prices over the past couple of years. They now have online ordering, which comes in handy during busy lunch hours."}
{"text":"Northlake's Five Guys is on par with any other Five Guys. Placed an online order and it was ready in a timely manner. The food here is always tasty and cooked well. Five Guys probably has the best burgers in Charlotte. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers but they have a tendency to undercook their fries. I'm not sure if it's because they don't change their oil often enough or it's just plain undercooked but too many fries come out soggy. Work on that and they're good."}
{"text":"I got just what I expected at this Five Guys: great service, delicious food and a clean restaurant. This location is hidden on Monroe Rd in the far part of the Walmart parking lot."}
{"text":"Envie d'un bon burger? C'est ici qu'il faut venir! √ânorme portion pour le prix, parfait pour ceux qui ont une faim de loup. On nous informe de la provenance des patates pour les frites et la vari√©t√©! Ambiance tr√®s d√©contract√© et musique trop bien! Je conseille fortement si jamais la faim l'emporte."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, the price runs a bit high but you totally get what you pay for.  Service is pretty fast and staff is polite."}
{"text":"If I were Super Man, my weakness would not be kryptonite, it would be fries, and I would be reduced to crawling my way through the front door of Five Guys because gosh darn, these are some tasty fries, and they serve them in sizes that could be best described as villainous. Take note: order them Cajun style. 

This was my first visit to Five Guys, and if it is your first time, I think it is important to know a \"little\" burger is one patty, while the standard burger is two, and unless you're a family of four, a regular size fry will be more than you can possibly finish. They basically fill the entire sack with fries! I tried my best to consume them all. They are fresh, cut thicker variety, closest to a Wendy's fry, but with more evidence of a real potato. 

As for the burger, they offer a respectable selection of toppings, as many as you want for no additional charge. I went basic with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles. It is served up on a soft sesame bun. The patty isn't the thickest, so if you're passionate about your meat, you might want the standard. However, I was more than pleased with the little. It gave me just the right amount of charbroiled tastiness to go along with my burger salad. 

Plus, they have the space age Coke machine. Vanilla Mr. Pibb Zero, no problem!

For a fast food establishment that slings burgers, the won me over with the fries, and I honestly enjoyed my burger."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try Five Guys for years and finally got around to it. Definitely a better burger than your average fast food joint. 

The staff was super helpful and friendly since we told him we hadn't been there before. We got hamburgers, iced tea, and fries. We got the regular size fries, and small would probably have been sufficient since it was huge. The fries were really good, greasy enough but not nasty. The burgers were yummy, too. Friendly, clean, and tasty."}
{"text":"Burgers are home made. Fries are cut fresh daily and deep fried perfectly. They also serve fresh peanuts that u grab yourself from a huge bin and enjoy while u wait for your food, which isn't very long."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in this five guys, I normally go to the one off of Scottsdale & greenway and LOVE the service and the food. My friend and I were in the mall and we decided to wait for five guys to open instead of going somewhere else.

We got in line and the woman at the counter explained the menu to my friend since she had never been to a five guys before and told us the small fry was enough for 3-4 people. We started to order and I tried to order what I normally get at every other five guys which includes grilled tomatoes. Someone else behind the counter jumped in and said they weren't allowed to grill tomatoes and would not give me a reason why, he listed off ten other things they were allowed to grill though. I used to work at a five guys and, like I said earlier, order the same thing all the time at other locations. It wouldn't have been a big deal if he would just have told me why. So I just ordered and didn't get tomatoes. We went to the drink machine and they were out of almost every soda. Then we got out order and we got enough fries to maybe feed two people, which was definitely not what we were told while ordering. The cheese was barely melted on my friend's burger and my grilled cheese.

Very disappointed, I definitely won't be stopping at this location again."}
{"text":"Awesome stuff - especially the cajun fries!  Great service and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Five Guys is a burger joint, apparently originating on the East Coast, that recently opened up in Pipefitter's old space (across from Steep 'n' Brew) on State St. My fiancee and I have been eying their \"coming soon\" sign for sometime, so when we saw they finally opened, we decided to give them a try.

There was a line ahead of us, but considering the length of the line that formed behind us, I think we were lucky enough to just beat the dinner rush. The menu is fairly basic -- hamburger, cheeseburger, hamburger or cheeseburger with bacon, and two sizes of soda and fries -- but you get to pick the \"toppings\" that go on your burger. I ordered with \"everything\", which included ketchup, mustard, onions, mushrooms, pickles, tomatoes, mayo... Maybe one or two other things, but I can't remember now. My fiancee listed off the things she wanted on hers, specifically eschewing tomatoes because she's allergic. We both ordered fried and a drink. We were given a number and told it would be around 8 or 9 minutes.

After a few minutes -- less than 10, I think -- our order came up, served in a brown paper bag. We snagged it and claimed a table. 

Inside, there were two styrofoam cups overflowing with french fries, a handful of napkins (already slightly greasy from sitting on top of the fries) and two burgers, individually wrapped in foil and helpfully marked \"1\" and \"2\".

The fries were excellent. Cut from real potatoes, not the shaped processed crap you get at fast food chains, crispy and moderately salted. My burger was almost too much to handle -- all their burgers come with double patties, and with \"everything\" on top of it, it was hard to fit my mouth around the thing. It made for a messy, though tasty, entree. The patties were well-done but still juicy; exactly how I like it, but if you're the sort who likes blood running down your chin, you may be a bit disappointed that they serve all their burgers well-done. 

My fiancee had a small problem with her burger: They put tomatoes on it. She spoke to the manager and he promptly made her another, running it out to our table within a few minutes. We got to keep the original, which made an excellent midnight snack for me later on. :)

Overall, I was impressed by the quality of both the food and the service, and felt the price was reasonable. I'm glad State St finally has a good burger place."}
{"text":"This location is hit or miss. I think they are mismanaged. If they are not busy and/or have enough people working the food is good. If you ask to speak to the Manager he's never in it is usually a Shift Manager. It is not the Shift Managers fault that they don't staff accordingly. Most recently the times I've gone in the food is disappointing.  Too many burger places along this road to choose from. Time to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with the fact that I did not get a burger... at a burger joint. I know dumb idea to expect a good grilled cheese sandwich, but they had not one but two menu items for grilled cheese sandwiches!

I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with saut√©ed onions and mushrooms and a side of french fries. Despite getting regular size fries, the girl dishing out the fries scooped up an extra bit and tossed it in the bag as well. That's about as far as the compliments go in this review.

I really wish I had anything positive to say about the sandwich, but it was pretty terrible all around. The cheese was soft and gooey like a nacho cheese, but lacking in any flavor. In fact 20 minutes later after the cheese had cooled off the cheese was exactly the same consistency. If they use the same cheese for the cheeseburgers, then I can't imagine anyone giving this place high marks. Additionally the bun/bread or whatever it was was soggy with grease and tasteless.

Maybe the burgers here are amazing (though I have serious doubts), but the grilled cheese sandwich left a bad enough taste in my mouth that I will be staying far away from this place."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot better than In-N-Out which seems to be the popular litmus test of burger joints. The thing is that I don't really care for In-N-Out.

Five guys makes pretty much the same burger that you could make at home if you were not a lazy person.

When this place opened two coworkers had an epic two hour argument about In-N-Out vs. 5-guys. It was crazy.

I don't understand the hype. I am convinced that it is because it has been so long since most people have had a real fresh handmade burger. Most of the time when you go to someones pool-party/bbq they pull out the frozen burger patties. We are so used to frozen processed food that when some place gives us decent fresh food we go nuts.

Also don't go here if you are allergic to peanuts."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about 5 Guys burgers so I just HAD to try one!
The the restaurant itself wasn't what I had expected in the West Island, I thought it would be a little more fancier than it was an I was disappointed, warehouse looking restaurant, hence the 4 stars over 5.

I ordered the double cheese with just lettuce fries and a coke. The burger did live up to hype it was fresh and delicious although I did find a little pricey at almost $ 15 however compared to a Big Mac trio at almost $ 9 and definitely 5 Guys much better quality by far and more bang for your buck!

The super friendly service I received as well free peanuts to nosh on while waiting did make up for the coldness of the atmosphere/lack of ambiance.

If you haven't been to a 5 Guys you should give a try!"}
{"text":"Five Guys is a burger chain from Arlington, VA with a plethora of awards, a cult following, and a firm endorsement from President Barack Obama. 

I must have walked by the Tempe location of Five Guys about Five Times and never felt inclined to go in. I was either not hungry, didn't want a burger, or was turned off by the appearance of the place. White, red, florescent lighting, loud \"classic\" music, stacked bags of potatoes, and huge crates of peanuts. It's like Fuddrucker's died (actually fuddruckers did die... RIP) and In N Out had relations with it's dead carcass and created Five Guys.

Their prices are definitely not fast food prices. I had a \"little burger\" with fries and a soda and my total was just shy of $10 which is about $5 less than the same thing from prime burger joints around the valley. The girl behind the register did a nice job of explaining the menu to me, but was texting I think at the same time so her concentration was not there when I had a question, and it still wasn't there when she made my burger (yes, she made it) because she forgot some of my toppings. I found the burger to be about in line with Denny's or Five and Diner. It was better than fast food, but not by a huge margin. The fries were God-awful soft messes. This may be personal preference here, but I want my fries to be crispy and NOT TASTE LIKE POTATO.

I wanted to enjoy my experience as it's a place to walk to from home, but honestly, for the quality to price ratio, I'd rather get in the car and drive ten minutes to Fez, Delux, or Richardson's for that Green Chile Burger, which are all $10. They don't include any fries, but c'mon, with a really good burger you don't need any sides. Overall, it just wasn't good, and I'll be asking Barack for a stimulus refund for the cost of my burger."}
{"text":"FOOD:

Their burgers and fries are BIG. 

- Fries - 
PRO: Fries have a good aroma and flavor.
CON: The fries are kinda saltier than average, which is not a good thing but the flavor of the fries is really good so I like it. My suggestion is not to add too much salt on it coz it already has a good flavor. No need to overdo the salt.

- Burgers -
PRO: The burgers are amazing. I love that you get to pick your toppings and that they have Jalapenos. 


SERVICE:

PRO: I love the service here because they wanna make it right for their customers. If you are not satisfied with the food, you can tell them how to improve and they will do their best to make it right. I think that is really really good and important. I was impressed by the service."}
{"text":"Love this new addition to Henderson!  Food was awesome and the service was great and friendly!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Five Guys, but it is just so greasy. My stomach wasn't happy so I won't be back. I do like the free peanuts and the quick service."}
{"text":"Five Guys does a fine job as far as chains are concerned. About the same quality, or maybe just below, as In-N-Out. The food quality of the burger was great, and the bun may have been the best part. The lettuce, however was slightly brown in areas and the tomato was terribly out of season. Good fries, but a small could feed four people. The amount of fries was ridiculous and gimmicky. I'd like to have seen this chain go for local beef, potatoes, and produce. That's a \"gimmick\" that would impress me more."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. 

I recently went to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location and ordered a small Cajun fry with my burger. I received a regular fry instead. Not really a big deal. I almost didn't say anything, but the Cajun fries are one of the reasons I go to 5 Guys, so I did. 

The girl filling orders immediately apologized and said she would get my Cajun fries for me. I was satisfied with that. When I was called back up, she not only had my order corrected, but handed me a cash refund and an EXTRA bag of Cajun fries for my friend I was sitting with. I was shocked. You don't often see this kind of above-and-beyond service.

Five Guys is a no-nonsense restaurant. They do only a few things, and they do them well. I'm happy to include good customer service in the things they do well."}
{"text":"I thought it was a tasty burger and the options were great. It's as if Five-guys has overheard me when I eat at in-n-out complaining about a lack of bacon and mushrooms! But it wasn't as if the burger was some reconceived concoction that redefined what a burger is or can and should be. So go here if you haven't and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Naw, these are NOT better than In-n-out by a far stretch.
Having heard recently that these were tied as the best burgers in the nation, I was anxious to compare to San Diego's local In-N-Out Burgers.
The decor is surprisingly similar to In-N-Out restaurants, diner style with red and white tiles. 
Very friendly young staff that help you out if you've never been there with the menu that is totally a la carte. This is very surprising that there is not value meal deal available.Two burgers,one fries to split and two drinks were $20 bucks,not cheap
However,there are plenty of peanuts everywhere you can dip into while waiting for your order.
BURGERS:
Buns are very ho hum, small and uneventful.They also provide the choice of excellent grilled onions and the meat is very good, looks to be homemade, very tasty and juicy burger. Cheese was oddly melted and messy but not in a really good way.
FRIES were cooked in peanut oil and I thought rather oily,soggy and not appealing after awhile.
I was sure hoping that Five Guys would come through for me but they really need to rethink their buns and fries to come anywhere close to excellent."}
{"text":"So it was my first time trying 5guys and..... It was AMAZING! period."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Five Guys ever.

Was shopping at LV Premium Outlet and needed som lunch.

Boy oh boy, a two patty, bacon and cheese and a load of regular fries - besided the Way they pack the stuff, burger in the bottom and alle the fries on top, I was in for a treat. The packing didn't bother me, but I would imagine that my wife, had she been there, would have thought it was stupid ;-)

Great tasting pattys and everything was Nice and hot.

The sodamachine, never seen a thing like it, had so many different choices and even subchoices to add a little extra flavor."}
{"text":"Whenever I am craving a burger, I commonly hit five guys because their burgers are big. This is a place to make your money's worth. The employee's are really nice too! When it was my first time the cashier had no problem breaking down the ordering process and their menus, I asked a lot of questions, and he didn't sound irritated at all. Kudos for that dude because after that it motivated me to come in again. 

I order the bacon burger and their toppings are free so I get all the things that I want: onions, jalape√±o, lettuce, etc. I order the five guys style fries but never tried the Cajun style, it looks good but their five guys style goes perfectly with the bacon burger. Wait time isn't that long especially when there's a long line, expect to wait 15 minutes at the most. Mine and my fianc√®'s order costs around $20 for the burgers, fries, and a drink."}

{"text":"I wasn't super impressed the first time I tried Five Guys, so I figured I'd give them a chance to redeem themselves.  Alas, I'm still pretty \"meh\" about them.  Burger was okay, but the fries are SUPER oily.  I know it's peanut oil, so it's supposed to be better for you, but seriously, by the time I got home, the paper bag was pretty much soaked through.

And, side note about this location, overall very clean, but no toilet seat covers in the restrooms?  What are we, heathens?"}
{"text":"I've had Five Guys at other locations, and have always enjoyed the food.  
Last week, my husband and I decided to break our payday ritual of \"Del Taco Night\", and decided to try the Five Guys on our new-ish side of town.  

The location is easy to find.  Its bright, open, and clean.  
They have the trademark boxes of peanuts for people to snack on while they wait for their orders.  I thought about snagging some, but since I was not dining in, I decided to forgo it this time.

Service was awesome.  The young man who took my order was extremely personable, laughed with me, and was very attentive to our order.  (He also told me that this location will be getting milkshake options soon!  Woo Hoo!)

There was a short wait while my food was prepared, but I already knew that Five Guys cooks to order, so I was ready.  I love spots like this...they aren't just microwaving a sad, frozen patty.  I love the open kitchen.  It really permits customers to see how their food is being handled and prepared.  

The cooks were great.  They were on it, and communicating with each other.  

My order was ready in no time, and I flew home.

So...the honest reason for the 4 star instead of 5 is the fact that my burger's bun was so greasy, it fell apart when I got home and started to eat.  That was super disappointing.  

The burgers themselves are huge, and seasoned well.  Toppings were generous.  

Have you tried the Cajun fries?  They are amazing.  A large was SO big!  My husband and I split it, and we both had fries left over.  Not for the faint of heart, they have a steady spice build that had me sniffling.  (I put ranch on mine at home, it helped cut the spice a little bit.)

All in all, this was a great visit.  I was sad about the greasy, falling apart bun, but I'm sure the 10 minute drive home didn't help matters.  I'd like to come back and actually dine in to see how it holds up."}
{"text":"Not a good value. We used to like getting take-out here. Good food and fast. The prices have gone up and the service takes too long. They don't seem to have the high traffic they once had, resulting in a slow assembly cook line..longer wait time. Adding fries and a drink to the current prices makes Chili's, or similar restaurant seem like a better deal."}
{"text":"Pretty good , the burgers taste like homemade burgers and you get free peanuts. When you dine in they sometimes give you unlimited fries , one order is usually enough for two people. Updated to 5 sorry about the 4"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Very expensive for what it is. Also very noisey place, music way too loud!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to waste time comparing this place to In-n-Out. They are completely different. period. I prefer a bigger meatier burger with mushrooms and bacon but everyone has their own personal preferences. 

The fries both here and at In-n-out dont' compare to the industrially-engineered unnatural (yet perfect) fries at Mcdonald's, but they are both natural fries and that's the way it is. They aren't great, the fries at in-n-out aren't great. I dont really eat many french fries so I don't care. 

My burger was perfection (I actually LOVE canned mushrooms so I'm so pumped they give me these included in the price), and the bacon and cheese and meat was all delicious. As an added plus, they have 100% beef Hebrew National hotdogs. You can get cheese melted on them too, or cheese and bacon. I split a yummy cheesy hot dog with my husband in lieu of fries ! 

So I'm taking a star off because I used their online ordering system so I could skip the lines. I pulled up to the extremely crowded, busy restaurant (they had 17 people working in the kitchen so they definitely weren't understaffed!), and told the order guy \"I'm Blair, I have a web order, do you know how I pick that up\". He gave me a clueless look then asked the manager. She fiddled around a bit and then said \"uh yeah, it's being made\". Ok, fair enough. The problem is even though i told him my name and that I ordered online, they only call the orders out by number. After he called \"43\" a whopping 5x, I asked him \"any chance that's for me\". He shrugged and handed me the bag- sure enough it said \"WEB ORDER - BLAIR\" in huge letters on top. Hey clown, when I tell you \"I'm blair, waiting for a web order\" maybe don't call it out by  number??!?!? How are web orders supposed to know we are order \"43\"??? Call web orders out by name, idiot!

Anyways, despite my little web pick up mishap, the food was delicious and wonderful and I will be returning many times. I'm hoping because I went on their 2nd day of business they will iron out the issues (like internet orders) and when I return this week they will be better."}
{"text":"Don't know how to start.  I'm normally a huge fan of 5 guys burgers and fries, but tonight not so much.  Hot dog and fries and soda was 11.00, then I had to endure a freakin picture of Obama looking at me on their wall.  Music was exceptionally loud and staff not very friendly.  Busy chatting with each other. 
No reason to run back so I can throw up the food while Obama is watching.   Wienerschnitzel   Is close and so is in and out burgers."}
{"text":"Not on my radar for a burger and fries craving.....First off be sticker shocked on the cost for a burger, yes I do get the larger one, but still to drop 10 bucks on a soda and burger is on the higher cost chart.  No fries, just the large burger and a soda!

I can say everything taste fresh, say Wendys like?  The extra toppings and additional sauces help.

If you like \"building\" your own burger this is the place for you. They let you select topping and sauces or you can ask for one with the fixings which includes alot of the toppings.  

I prefer premade flavor personally.  I want the restaurant to build the flavor profile so I don't have to mix the wrong items together and get a unsatisfing end product.  

If you want a fresh build your own burger this is the place.....For this price range I want gourmet burgers....Try Amuse Bouche in surprise if you want a burger with a great flavor profile....They sometimes run out of the burger so call ahead :)"}
{"text":"Everyone I know who's been to this place compares this joint to a West Coast In n Out burger restarurant, but I beg to differ. The burgers and fries are in no way made the same, and they dont even have milkshakes or handmade onion rings. 

Never the less, I really enjoyed this style of burger and the way it was cooked. DOUBLE PATTY, CHEESE, you can add bacon (which you cant do at In n Out), and all the traditional sides to a burger. The patties are juicy and remind me of a simple homemade burger except at a much better quality :D. The burgers are stacked tall and it can be difficult to bite into. Then, I love that you can get the fries either traditional or cajun. I tried the Cajun style but I wasn't a big fan of it (too much cayenne pepper flavor), the fries were cooked and sized just right so next time I'm just going to have traditional style. On top of that, they give you WAY MORE fries than you order so I think no matter what size you get - medium- large- You'lll have plenty of fries left over. 

I think it's a bit pricey for a small burger joint- you'll probably spend about $8-$10 if you order the whole shabang burger-fries-drink and about $5.69 for the burger alone. Overall, I love this place and plan on comin back for more! :D"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place for a long time, finally decided to give it a try. I have to say it was a HUGE LET DOWN. From everything Ive been told about how good the burgers are mediocre at best. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I'd say the burgers are somewhere between McDonalds and Wendy's. In N Out has this beat hands down. Oh and as for price....no way will I ever be eating here again, way way over priced for the quality of the food. Mediocre burgers, at a hefty price tag. Only give 2 stars because the service was great. Way way way over rated food here"}
{"text":"This is the subway of burgers, u make it ur way. It's consistently delicious, great service, and always fresh! The fries remind me of being on the boardwalk!"}
{"text":"First time ever having Five Guys! It was a great first experience. Was greeted by a nice guy, he was very patient with me while I figured out what I wanted. They have so many options!! Our food came out quick and it was so delicious. I don't understand why it's taken me so long to try Five Guys, but I will definitely have it again."}
{"text":"Five Guys is a solid fast food joint. Staff was cool, service was quick, and the restaurant was very clean. I had no previous experience and randomly stopped in on a Sunday night. Traffic was nonexistent so I waltzed right up and ordered a little bacon burger to go (little means one beef patty). They offer all the fixings including mushrooms, onions, lettuce, tomato, and ketchup. My burger ran me about $7 and it was pretty good. You can taste the difference between this is and normal fast food. It is just better quality, juicy and fresher. Kudos to you guys and I'll be sure to try another one next visit."}
{"text":"First, this place reeks of being a national-chain-franchise-type restaurant.  The staff is trying to be enthusiastic like they have been instructed, but it feels very fake.  

Otherwise, the burgers are good.  As you have heard, the standard burger contains two patties, the smaller version has one.  The fresh-cut fries were excellent, maybe the best in Tempe.

We may go back, but probably won't go out of our way."}
{"text":"Bad service! Mixed up my damn order!"}
{"text":"Check this off the list - I was waiting on the GF (who was attending a baby shower) and I wasn't even hungry, but I was determined to try this legendary burger joint. I popped in for a \"little burger\" with the works and enjoyed every bite. Definitely a huge step-up from Burger King and the like. They keep it simple here - simple decor, simple signs, simple food."}
{"text":"Hard to beat this for lunch under $10. The quality of the ingredients they use here is obvious. This blows McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Jack in the Box out of the water!!! Lots of free toppings to choose from too. There is no drive-thru but you can get \"in and out\" with a burger pretty quick."}
{"text":"So I am only 96.27% positive that I have been to a 5 Guys in Carson, CA (South of Los Angeles, by the Ikea)
So, I've read some of the other reviews, and I totally get the VISUAL comparisons to In and Out, but that's it really. 
The fries are a million times better!  The burgers were thicker and juicier and so flavorful! The bacon was great, the bbq sauce was tasty, the grilled onions were great, good texture not as grilled and mushy as In and Out.
I think my sandwich would have been better with Cheddar rather than American cheese. The American was a little too salty for my taste, but it was still a great burger!
I do have to say though, it is a bit pricey. I paid $12 for a bacon cheese burger, fries and a large drink. That's not much cheaper than Delux or Fez, and more expensive than Smash Burger.
Can't wait for a second (or is it third?) visit!"}
{"text":"Mmmm I love me a good ol fashioned backyard style burger, and that's what you get at Five Guys. I always order a baby cheeseburger because I can't handle a double patty, just too much meat for me. I love that you can add whatever you want to your burger and basically make it your way. They will grill the mushrooms and the jalape√±os which is a plus in my book. The burgers are juicy and full of flavor, they don't over do it with the condiments and use good pickles. The place is always clean, and the service always friendly. The French fries are yummy and you can literally have one order for a family of four, with everyone getting more than enough to share. It's a bit pricey for a fast food joint, really no different than fatburger. Depending on what you order it can add up to about 30.00 for four. If you haven't had five guys your missing out, definitely kills In-N-Out in my opinion."}
{"text":"Five Guys isn't a place you stop by everyday for lunch, mainly because you'd die before your tenth visit and you'll be broke.

The burgers are delicious if you like thin, crusted patties that are made to order on a pan top. They are not grilled and they are not thick. As far as I know they're unseasoned. Do yourself a favour and get the regular cheeseburger, not the mini wuss (unless you eat here everyday...). 

The regular fries are good for two, but they're not as generous as the Five Guy's in America. The cajun fries are gross, but I know a few who love them...to each their own.

Drink are self-serve and free refills, so really you only have to get one cup and two straws if you're willing to compromise with your fine dining partner.

If you're allergic to peanuts, run away! The fries are fried in peanut oil and there are boxes of shelled peanuts there for customers to help themselves to. 

I like my burger with grilled onion, mushrooms, pickles and lite ketchup (yes they do \"lite\" and can even go lite on lettuce). Not sure about this location but in general the jalapenos are fresh and not the pickled kind you get at a hot dog stand."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't rated this location!

I love smash patty burgers and I love Five Guys. Customer service is almost always friendly here, even a few minutes before closing. The workers here work very hard to make delicious burgers and have a smile on their face.

I don't like the fries but I'd definitely recommend the cheeseburger and for regular appetites the little cheeseburger (it's not really little, just one patty instead of two) with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, lite ketchup and jalapenos. Perfect!

If I didn't care about my health and weight, I'd eat here everyday.

Side note: as with other Five Guys, they post where their potatoes come from. I think it's cute :)"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Five Guys burgers. This location is no exception. The burgers are prepared well and the staff is rather friendly. Burger toppings are customer picked and there are several options to choose from. My favorite is the bacon cheeseburger which is pretty large actually. If you're not a big water you could probably split one with someone. Fries are overloaded into a container and there are complimentary peanuts!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Five Guys and I have to say I wasn't prepared for the experience.

I mean I wasn't prepared financially. I walked in with $10 in my pocket and after looking up at the menu I quickly realized I'd be walking out with only a burger- no fries, and no drink. So, disappointed, I ordered a bacon cheeseburger \"all the way\" with no pickles (pickles are plain evil). That ran $7.45 after tax by itself. The $2.99 for medium fries and $2.50 for a drink they are asking made my jaw drop. I heard the fries are good but no way they are $3 good.

Yes, I'm cheap, but I have to be. I'm broke and under-employed. The prices here are just too much.

As for the burger, It was pretty darn good I must say. Nice and juicy, big and meaty. I liked the grilled onions. They gave the burger a unique taste.

As good as the burger was, I can't see paying over $7 for one so I won't be back to Five Guys anytime soon.

What gave me a good laugh while I was waiting for the burger was a big sign they have up on the wall that says \"Voted Best Bargain\" by the Washington times or some east coast paper. 

BTW, I stopped at a Circle K on the way home and got a 32oz coke to wash it down for 79 cents!"}
{"text":"Those are some tasty burgers! A 100 rating doesn't hurt either. I've been to this location plenty of times. I've always enjoyed the burgers. You can pick and choose your topping at no extra cost and they have a lot to choose from. Also, the fries are good. They give you soooo many fries make sure to share them with someone. I'd give this place a 5 stars but the fries are a bit too salty for my liking. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"This was our first time at a Five Guys.  The gentleman that took.our order explained the menu to us and was very nice.  We each ordered a cheeseburger andy husband ordered a small fries yo split.  Before our order was up, a cook called over and said they had an extra patty.  We were welcome to add it to one of our singles free of charge.  When we got our order shortly after that we also noticed that our small fries was HUGE!  I highly recommend this establishment if you like burgers.  Additionally, I noticed the cooks wear rubber gloves!  An added plus for me, being OCD!"}
{"text":"Came here to grab a little burger and Cajun fries. Took our order pretty fast.  The burgers takes awhile because they are cooking it. 

Free peanuts. Tastes pretty good. Nothing special. 

Now their burgers, in my opinion, is juicy and tastes wayyyyyy better than the burgers at McDonalds. They should add more toppings.

Will I come back?  Yes. 

Food:  5/5
Ambience:  4/5
Service:  5/5
Cleanliness: 5/5"}
{"text":"When I come in, the staff always remembers me and that I have food allergies and they are always happy to change their gloves, wash their hands, and specially make my order for me.  They are so friendly and always accommodate my requests!  Thank you for your great service and for being such a helpful and friendly team!"}
{"text":"How this place doesn't get only five star reviews, I do not know.

BEST burgers. Ever. I don't even care that it's a franchise. It is everything. It is worth the $30 you'll spend to feed two people. The fries are SO good! Cajun or original. You can't go wrong.

The burgers are amazing and filling and literally the BEST hang over food you could imagine.

I always get the little cheeseburger and we share a regular order of fries between two people which is MORE than enough. And if you're really hungry and you can't wait the 5 minutes or less it takes to get your food, there are peanuts to snack on while you wait.

I love this place and this location specifically. Eat here! I crave it weekly."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I walked in to this establishment wanting to give this place 5 stars.  I want it to succeed.  I wanted a damn good burger.

I've eaten Five Guys before on the east coast.  I am no stranger to their wonderful concept.  Fresh products and amazing taste at a reasonable price.  I've eaten some amazing burgers at other Five Guys places.

Every burger you order is a double.  It says on the menu \"cheeseburger\" but it's a double cheeseburger.  Also a large fry will feed 2 (I'll get to that later)  Also all the toppings are included in the price.  Their toppings are about as generous as Subways toppings.  Plenty of variety.  Both the wife and I had a bacon cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushroom, lettuce and mayo and ketchup.  It's about a 10 minute wait for your food.  They have peanuts to keep you entertained while you wait.  

As I rip into this greasy bag of goodness, I notice that my burger looks terrible.  I mean worse that any burger I have ever had at an greasy fast food joint.  The bottom bun is ripped to shreds, the toppings are falling everywhere including the meat and cheese.  Did the cook miss and not bother to fix his mistake?  At first I thought they served me a single burger but then under all the cheese I see another patty the size of a silver dollar.  I was so hungry and with my family, I was not in the mood to complain (oh and I can complain) I ate that burger in pieces because it was impossible to pick up.  I was so sad.  My wifes burger was fine.  She loved it but has had better.

The fries are the only reason Five Guys got 2 stars.  They are fresh cut and cooked to perfection.  Best part about them, they fill up the container then add an additional scoop in the bottom of the bag.

Overall, I am going to give this place one more shot.  One more opportunity to show me why this place is Zagat rated.  If it doesn't you better believe this time I am going to get my money back.

Let me know how your experience went here.  I hope it was an isolated incident."}
{"text":"As I thought from my earlier review, my first impression was an off day. Today's visit was a million times better. The staff was awesome and helpful. The food was cooked to perfection. I had an issue where I was accidentally charged twice, but when brought to the manager's attention it was immediately fixed. I couldn't have asked for a better visit. These guys worked very hard to make great food and give excellent customer service. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am only giving two stars due to the burgers. They tasted great. However, the fries left a lot to be desired. I don't know what it was but i did NOT like the taste. I've been a customer at 5 guys for years so i know what they should taste like. 

When we went to get a refund, the manager was very defensive. Rather than saying \"i apologize that you didn't enjoy your fries\", she started getting loud. 

Although i liked the burger, i won't be coming back."}
{"text":"One of our families favorite burger joints! Love that everything is customized to your liking."}
{"text":"Juicy, tasty burgers. Also, love the access to peanuts while we wait.

The only downside for me is the price, since they dont sell combos. My burger, fries and drink cost me $15!!!

Craziness, I always curse myself when i come here after realizing I spent $15 and can't finish my meal. But yet, I always come back.
Sigh..."}
{"text":"Fervent believers in the Five Guys, prepare to hear some heresy.  This place, to which I had been led to believe was the Be All, End All of Hamburglery, is in the end a victim of perhaps its own hype machine and generally the fact that it's the same bowling alley/greasy spoon diner burger I've had over the years.  

It's really, really pricey too.  $12 for a combo can be explained for when you get a burger the size of a lesser Japanese island and a over-filled cup of fries, the portions are beyond adequate for two people on that.  The toppings are nice, but tend to get everywhere by bite 3.  

Places like Create have the same quality meat but far better (less crowded/expensive) atmosphere.  I think I'll stick to them rather than getting cross-town for less of a good thing."}
{"text":"Called and ordered my food at 9:50, 10 minutes before they close. The guy that took my order was very nice. Got there at 9:57 and everyone with a smile, not acting annoyed that I ordered so late. Love them! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food is always made to order and tastes amazing and fresh. Staff is courteous and friendly, too. Long lines at lunch time and since food is literally made when it's ordered, it takes longer than most fast food joints."}
{"text":"I like 5 guys inside me!.... wait.... that sounds odd.

I recommend to go there since they offer free peanuts, decent burger with some awesome toppings. Fries!! mmmmm, with the cajun salt peppery stuff. Free drink refills!

The location was well kept and the staff is friendly.

Only negative is the price, I think it is a little high for the burger."}
{"text":"Five Guys was delicious. I heard from previous people who were from the mid-west area that this franchise is really popular... like an In-N-Out. I love good quality burgers so I had to give this place a try. I had a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, grilled onions, and mayo. It was a juicy, delicious goodness. I didn't order the french fries because I'm allergic to peanut oil..... 

Usually whenever I eat hamburgers or any type of meat, I have a sensitive palate and can taste the \"gaminess\" of the meat... which means the mean if poor quality. However, their burger was perfect! Way better than Steak and Shake.... 

I ordered to-go over the phone and you can also do it online. If you live near the place its worth it cause the line is short compared to when you dine- in. 

I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Good burgers.  Fresh ingredients.  Medium fry was MORE than enough for two of us!  Staff asked a couple times if everything was good and if we were happy.  Soda machine is one of the ones where you can order just about anything.  Ample seating.  Kind of a self-serve diner kind of feel.  Will go back.  :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a hot dog after a trip to the mall. While waiting, I also ordered a burger and fries to bring back to my friend. Enjoyed my hot dog with ketchup, mustard, and relish, along with a Cherry Coke from the Coca Cola Freestyle machine. Snatched a few fries out of my friend's bag too... the cup was overflowing so he wouldn't even notice. ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped in just to split an order of fries. This was the dirtiest Five Guys I've ever been to. I'm hoping they just had a big rush before we got there and hadn't had a chance to clean up yet. There was trash all over the floor, tables dirty and in disarray... the fries were good, as expected, although they didn't dump that many extra into the bag like the other Five Guys establishments I'm used to. And to be consistent with my general complaint about Five Guys, the music was too loud. They are capable of better."}
{"text":"Got a Little Bacon Cheeseburger with BBQ sauce & pickles and fries to-go. Everything was a little cold by the time I got to eat it, but nothing the microwave couldn't fix. The fries reheat better than most fast food fries."}
{"text":"Tip: The Fries are Superb, Best I've ever had, and if you like them enough, you can ask for more!

One of the Best Burgers for your Buck in town! The Fact that I can add whatever toppings I want is what makes them stand out. This location is on my side of town, Thank God. Before that we had to go to Henderson. This place is Always Clean. The Staff is always Friendly and Upbeat. They play Rock Music! They have two Custom Coke Soda Fountain Machines. The Bathrooms are Always Clean. They offer Free Peanuts and you can be as messy as you want, which is Great because we have rugrats.

Tip: The Burgers are always Double Patties, if you want one patty order a \"Little\"

I always get a Bacon Cheeseburger with Mayo, Lettuce, Tomato, Grilled Onions and Mushrooms and Ketchup and it's always been perfectly the same each and every time.

The Kids Grilled Cheese is Excellent if you have little ones or if you are, vegetarian, it's very delicious.

Again, I must stress that their Fries are Excellent! My Favorite Fries of all time!"}
{"text":"One of the worst burgers I ever had. Had to spit it out.  The fries were very gross too- near tasteless, what taste there was, was awful."}
{"text":"A great place for a small joint like this on the west coast. 
Better burger and fries than in-n-out!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the burgers here. Theyre very juicy, cooked just right and they have a wide aray of options for building your burger. The fries were delicious, fresh and well seasoned. They are  like a orgasm in my mouth. and they give you SOOO much! Lol they give you almost a entire bag full to the brim of fries. The only problem was with the seating...it was hard to finding table  and not accidentally bump into somebody else. But I think it was because I visited  NFL experience downtown Phoenix at the Convention Center, and it was CRAZY. Their was a lot Seahawks fans out there ,which I hope they lose tomorrow Super Bowl."}

{"text":"4.3

been there a second time and asked for additional sauce in my burger... hence, the best!


My new burger home! I love this place, the atmosphere, the free peanuts, the fresh food, the cajun fries etc. 

Just improve the lining for ordering. Not enough cashiers, liners are stuck between the street, eating customers and washroom stairs. And when they have no ideas how this place works, it can be a mess."}
{"text":"Came to this place with my friends, we all ordered double patties burger.

Their burger was delicious, I personally like it. You can add any ingredient (some special sauce etc.) 

BUT their frit have way too much salt. Oh boy..It's like I ordered a burger with salt seasoned with frit -_-"}
{"text":"this place has good burgers and good prices.  i like the fact that the extras on your burger doesn't cost more.  the fries are fresh as well as the patties.  good burger joint for the whole family."}
{"text":"I would come back if I'm craving for a fast-food burger.

However I'd have to say thumbs up to their friendly, flamboyant cashiers. As well as how quick they pump out the burgers.

But Burger Priest still has my heart!"}
{"text":"I am very upset. I am a vegetarian. I called ahead of time and asked \"do you have a veggie burger\" I was told yes. When I called to order to go they told me it's just a bun with vegetables and cheese if I'd like. This is not very vegetarian friendly. I know this is a burger joint. But there are also a lot of people for medical and personal reasons who can't eat meat. The menu NEEDS to include veggie burgers. Fatburger is my only option right now. Get with the times Five guys!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. I always love coming here and I even love the inside look of the place as well, If you order a small you still get a lot of fries so remember that when you order fries with your burger."}
{"text":"i have nothing bad to say about five guys. it's always deliciously artery clogging and the fries are bomb. it's probably a good thing that it's so expensive. otherwise i'd have died of a heart attack by now."}

{"text":"I've been to both the Mill Ave. and Ray Rd. Locations and both were exactly the same quality wise so this review can be considered for both. Yeah it's a chain burger place but it's a GOOD chain burger place. Big delicious burgers with almost any topping you could want all included in the standard price (so make sure you get your $'s worth by getting your burger loaded). I don't have anything negative to say about the food, don't think I've tried the fries since once you make your meal into a combo you're getting out of fast food pricing territory and well I feel bad paying over 10 dollars for a fast food burger. That really is the only drawback, slash a few dollars off the final meal cost and this place would be a shoe in for 5 stars. If I'm in the mood for \"fast food\" burgers it's this place or In n Out with I'd say a 75%/25% split favoring Five Guys.

Yes this is the same as my Mill review but gotta share a little love for the Ray Rd. location since they have 5 reviews and a 3 star rating."}

That really is the only drawback, slash a few dollars off the final meal cost and this place would be a shoe in for 5 stars. If I'm in the mood for \"fast food\" burgers it's this place or In n Out with I'd say a 75%/25% split favoring Five Guys."}
{"text":"It seems like every time I come to Five Guys with a friend, their prices increase. A little over $20 for two little cheeseburgers, two regular drinks, and a regular fry is outrageous!  I would be okay with that price if their burgers absolutely blew my mind, but I think their patties have lost some flavor.  Next time I want a good burger, I'll go to a local sports bar and get one of their burgers for a better deal.  

I used to love Five Guys, but it hurts my wallet too much for fast food.  I'd rather support a local business if I'm going to shell out that kind of money for just a burger and fries."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Five Guys and had dinner with the fam. I ordered a shroom burger with cheese, fries, and a fountain drink. We split a large fry because they give you quite a bit in one order. The Coca-Cola soda dispensers are awesome. They can mix many flavors of soda and fruit juices, which I really like. I made a fruit medley of sodas that was really tasty. I don't always drink pop, but when I do, I drink Coca-Cola flavors!

A few minutes went by and our order number 45 was called. When I picked it up, the bag was heavy. I took the food to my drooling family and we began to eat. My wife's hamburger was not the one she ordered, so they made her another one and told us to keep the extra one. Bonus! I took that extra burger home and ate it the next day. 

My shroom burger was every bit as delicious as I remembered. Making burgers to order with seasoned, fresh ground beef is the secret to the wonderful flavor. I can't eat here often because my midsection is already bulging.  If I'm going to have a burger, I'm going to Five Guys."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some burgers with a co-worker the other day at lunch.  I placed my order on-line to see if the service was on time.  It was.

Upon arrival, my co-worker placed his order, but I pissed him off by ordering ahead, so I won't do that again.  Sorry dude!  Anyway, I ordered two small burgers - one with onions, shrooms, cheese and mayo and the other with bacon, lettuce, tomato.  The shroom burger was off the hook delicious!  The bacon burger needed some mayo because it was kind of dry.  I'll know for next time.  The 'small' burgers are pretty good sized, actually.  I think from now on, I will just order one large shroom burger because two small burgers is too much food.  

Plus, I helped co-worker eat his 'small' order of fries, which in my opinion, is enough to feed three.  Anyway, I'm sure we'll return to this place because the food is so good.  It's a simple setup.  They have a small menu, which they execute to perfection on.  I doubt I'll ever eat a hot dog here.  Why would you when the burgers are some of the best around?

Recommend!"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers around.  The fries are great too because they're fresh and they really load you up with a lot of them.

I've only tried it once, but I am already an addict.  I'll be visiting the place every chance I get.

{"text":"Was in the mood for a Good Burger the other day, and when I want a good burger Five Guys always comes to mind. The menu is simple, and the ingredients are Fresh, and everything is made to order. There toppings seem to be neverending, and don't cost anything extra. So if your in the mood for a big juicy burger head to Five Guys. You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"I love Five Guys. First time to this location and was disappointed on the large fries portion. You use to get an extra scope of fries at the bottom of the bag but I guess they don't do that anymore. You set that expectation so needless to say we were disappointed and so were other patrons as we heard their comments as well."}
{"text":"I normally LOVE Five Guys - my favorite thing are the crispy, but still tender fries you get piled in the bag. Tonight was horrible! The guy handed me the fries and said \"if you don't like them, let me know and I can remake them. It was busy\" 

First off, I'm taking it to go, so I don't have the luxury of staying and having you remake it if you fail the first time. Secondly, why would you sell a product that you know is not correct out the gate? The fries were SOAKED in oil!! As if the temperature of the fryer dropped and the fries just drank in the oil. Not crisp and every single one of them was literally inedible. 

Luckily the burger was decent enough to eat, but if you have \"fries\" in your business name and you cant deliver something that even a Wendy's can do better....might be time to change the name."}
{"text":"The power of customer service.  I'm in Charlotte for a week during a conference.  After being in classes all day I dont have much desire to go out and sit down in a restaurant.  I just want to grab something quick and go back to the hotel.  Five guys is located in the epicenter area of charlotte. Its on the second level. There is no street parking and you must walk or use the parking that costs money from epicenter.  I went in around 5pm and it was not really crowded.  There was 3 or 4 other customers.  I was greeted right away by the employee working the register.  I believe his name was Billy.  He was a great employee.  He was happy and joking around and made the experience fun.  He was knowledgeable about the food and made suggestions.  The restaurant was clean and so were the restrooms. 
I ordered a little cheeseburger and it was hot and made fresh while I waited.  The fries were also hot and fresh.  You can also snack on peanuts while you wait.  I'd go back here just for the good customer service if nothing else. Try it out."}
{"text":"Had a burger once and I thought it tasted a little dry. Since my husband doesn't eat beef we were a bit disappointed they didn't have a turkey burger or a veggie burger or some other option.  

The service is friendly here.  And the Cajun Fries.  I've actually come in twice and gotten a medium order of Cajun Fries to go and taken them home in the brown paper bag and enjoyed them with whatever we were having for dinner that evening at home.  

I realized Five Guys has become really popular but for a straight up burger I still like the In-n-Out double-double protein style."}
{"text":"1st time eating at 5 guys, beats In&Out hands down. Quick service really clean, I got a cheeseburger with everything. Bun was soggy with all the stuff on it, just discarded it and ate the rest, used all the napkins! 

Fries were good and crisp and enough for two people, liked the free peanuts!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go when I'm craving a burger. Their burgers are honestly THE best! Juicy, flavorful and the patty is the right thickness. It's always dress to order and they have free, unlimited toppings! Their Cajun fries are delicious and they pretty much give you a bag full with one order. 

Oh, they have peanuts you can grab for free! Yum!

5 star for food - it was heaven in my mouth! 

The only reason i am giving this location a 4 star rating is because we watched an employee on break in the dining area with his head down sleeping!  Yes, sleeping! Right in the front. So disgustingly unprofessional. Want to nap? Nap in the back where you are not visible to customers. SMH We don't need your forehead grease on the table we eat on. No, he didn't wipe the table down after."}
{"text":"Free peanuts, yummy burgers made to perfection. 

Soda machine gave everyone lots of personal choice."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries here are SOOOO good!!the people that work there are really nice. I wouldn't recommend it as a special date night dinner. It is more of a causal quick dinning for family's."}
{"text":"Always nice staff. I think there burgers are good. I order off an app and sometimes a little late."}
{"text":"Really good tasting burgers! Cheese is a bit cheap, but fast, good service, quality burger for fast food!"}
{"text":"First and Last Visit. I went here with my mom as she was craving a burger. She had a bacon burger and a drink. I had a grilled cheese with jalapenos, some cajun fries, and a drink. What you notice visually at  first are the multiple, pasted-everywhere signs about how great they are. Red flag. The music was blaring so loud, and was quite a turn-off.  We found our way to the order counter, passing by the big bags of peanuts. Really? In a burger joint? Ordered, attempted to eat inside, but due to the music went outside. There are way too many fries in the order. The cajun seasoning was sparse at best. Mom said her bacon burger was good. My cheese sandwich was ok, and I liked having the jalapeno choice to put on it. I have to tell you I am unimpressed with this place. I think having the choices to put on your burgers/sandwiches are nice but the presentation was lackluster. Every order is placed in a bag as a to-go order, even if you're eating at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Fresh burgers made to order with the toppings you want and served quickly. Keep in mind that a \"little\" burger is one patty and a regular has two. Simple menu. You can get an \"un-burger\" cheese sandwich or a hot dog, fries, and shakes. That's about it.

Jalape√±os are fresh, not pickled, and bacon is crispy. Yes, they have bacon.

They have two Coke Freestyle machines for drinks. Just so you know. Some people love them, others hate them."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is expensive. The burgers are good, but I do think for the style of restaurant this is (fast-casual) the prices are steep. I believe you can get a better burger and fries from other Charlotte restaurants for a less expensive price and more extensive service. 

They have double and single burgers, and if you want bacon or cheese there is an up-charge. The fry portions are huge so a small is plenty."}
{"text":"I always love 5guys but definitely will not go back to this location due to the servers' unprofessional services.

A young pretty girl came in ordered something to go.  After she got her order and left, the minute she left, the guys (i can smell the overwhelming testosterone) cannot stop making fun or joking about her.  They even made some disgusting slapping noise.  OMG.  This is disgusting and unacceptable. 

I dont think any female should go close to this location at all.  Who knows what they gonna talk about u the minute u left."}
{"text":"My first time trying Five Guys and  I was told that this place would rival In 'n Out. I found it hardpress to believe since In n Out--come on...unless you're Shake Shack you can't compete. 

I think what Five Guys has over In n Out is the fact that they have a ton of toppings you can add for free - my favourites being grilled mushrooms and fresh jalape√±o pepper (SO SPICY). I also added lettuce, tomatoes, onions (They have grilled and raw), and pickles- it ended up being a pretty big burger, even though I ordered the small. In fact, the small is pretty filling regardless. The difference between the regular and the small is simply the number of patties. The regular size gives you two.

I like their fries better than in n out's but it was waaaay too salty, especially the cajun fries, was is just their regular fries sprinkled with an abundance of cajun seasoning. Get the small portion and you'll be good. If you get the regular you won't finish. If you get the large, they put a giant cup in your bag and then fill the BAG with fries. You'll have fries coming out of your ears.

The price is actually not that cheap. My water and my small burger worked out to be $8. I would say that In-n-Out definitely wins on all levels except for the quantity of ingredients available. But this place is still good.  I am, however, disappointed that they have no milkshakes."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service.   OK clean place.   But....burger overdone.   And I mean overdone.  No moisture at all.  And no cheddar cheese!   Come on!   Really?  Hey.   \"American\" cheese is NOT cheese.   It's an orange grease square.   Jack in the Box nearby does it better.  And they have cheddar!!!!"}
{"text":"I always order the same thing. Little bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, mushrooms, ketchup and mustard. It's absolutely delicious!!  

I love love love the freedom coke fountain and want one in my home or Hawaii at least!! You can't go wrong with 7 different flavors of coke!!

They note that the fries are award winning but I don't care for them. Definitely wouldn't order more than the small (they fill up a small cup AND the paper bag it comes in full of the stuff. Waaaayy too much in my opinion but good size for sharing."}
{"text":"Every time I've eaten there, the burgers have been fantastic.  I never walk away hungry, that's for sure.

You can nosh on free peanuts while you wait for your order.

A small fry is quite a large serving.  It can be shared between two or more people.

The only downside is that it's pricey.  For two little burgers, one small fry, and one drink, it's 17 bucks.  

The employees at this location have always been pleasant.

There's outdoor seating if weather permits.  

Bathrooms are usually clean and they have a nice faucet, paper towels, and they've never been out of soap any time I've been there.

I'm actually going there again tonight.

Yum!"}
{"text":"Hey everybody! I got a joke for you! How many guys does it take to screw up a burger and fries? You guessed it! FIVE! 
I kept seeing my coworkers come into work with greasy paper bags from this place and finally decided to eat something fatty and greasy. Feeling excited about eating something REALLY \"bad\", I salivated as I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and small fries. The fries stained the bag as I hoped, and I couldn't wait to open my cheeseburger with all the \"fixins'. When I got home there was an abundance of fries--way too many for anyone who's trying to maintain some sort of flattering figure, so I scooped only those that fit in the little cup they came in and threw the rest away in the trash.
I microwaved my cheeseburger because I can't stand luke warm food and thought when I saw some melted cheese that this was going to be the best! WRONG! 
That damn burger was horrible. No flavor whatsoever! The patty was dry so I decided to put some salt and pepper on it and figured that would \"doctor it up.\".....WRONG! When I opened the burger, hardly any cheese was on it.
I ate it, along with those horrible looking and TASTING fries. I was so angry that I wasted my cheat meal on this crap. I should have went to McDonalds or Jack in the box---oooeeey gooey cheese, seasoned curly fries, or delicious McD's crispy shoe strings! Five Guys doesn't deserve five stars."}
{"text":"I like Five Guys when I am in the mood for a sloppy burger (i.e. hangover...). This new one on Laird is no exception, although they do struggle a bit with getting streamlined on the service side these first weeks after opening... The fries are great, but the chilly version was a disappointment (was just salty and hot...not a good spice).. the burgers are great,- order with \"the works\" and get a small one (the large one is the same, but with two patties). 

Don't expect a Burger's Priest, Burger Shoppe etc kinda burger..It's not, don't go there if thats what you want. This is more of a chain, but light years better than McDonalds etc."}
{"text":"good burgers and service but disappointed  in the cheese. everything else tastes so fresh and they even post which farm the potatoes come from. the processed cheese didn't fit and was gross."}
{"text":"First time in years to a five guys.  Service and staff were really good, really nice and all around good.  5 star for the staff, 3 star for the food, just because I don't think the burgers are that good, so you get a 4.  The fries are really good, but I think the burger is no better than a Wendy's burger, but a lot more expensive."}
{"text":"Friendliest 5 Guys in town and the best burgers in southwest Charlotte (yes, I've tried you other \"guys\").
One knock as parking is not the best."}
{"text":"One day I couldn't figure out what to eat so I wondered over to five guys( my usual after a party night lol) however when  I got there I saw the cashier, who is now the girl sweeping the floors, looks very disinterested in being there, she's pretty new and of Asian descent, make the most disturbing cough and snort I ever heard and then proceeded to address me rather than washing her hands. I just turned and walked away. Other than that I love five guys but come on staff need to understand that you don't do certain things around food that's for sale to the public."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite burger spot in town! Rather I'm stopping by before a night out with the guys or a ball game with my kids, I can always count on Five Guys to deliver that consistent flavor and feeling of a full belly! 

I will admit it's not the cheapest burger joint in town but you just have to know how to order! When out with my boys they immediately start to demolish the free peanuts (who am I to stop growing men from getting their protein?) leaving only enough room to split a kids burger, I get a cheeseburger with 2 patties, and the three of us split a large fry! That runs close to $25 with a drink! Not too shabby being it's technically not \"fast food\"! 

It's beef, it's fresh, and unlimited free protein!"}
{"text":"Hot thick patty, melting cheese, crunchy lettuce, juicy tomatoes, all compressed between two buns. Please give me this hot mess over any burger. What's also great is that fries orders are humongous. Compared to any other fast-food place, a trio at Five Guys will make you feel full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers. Nothing fancy here, these are for people who love the simplicity of the pure, great tasting beef. Add some basic topping if you want and grab some home made fries if you want your carbs. Always a good burger."}
{"text":"This was my first time at 5 Guys. It took me a long time because I once read that it had the highest calories of all fast food. But despite that I tried it with my coworkers and it was delicious. I had a tiny cheeseburger with a few toppings and it was a great size. I can't even imagine what the regular size looks like! I shared fries with a coworker and I'm glad I did because even a small was a lot of food. They didn't taste like any fast food fries I've ever had before. They were really good. My last praise might be weird but I really liked the pop machines. It was one of those high tech ones where you can choose different flavors. I made a peach Sprite! I got a kick out of that. Ooh and there are peanuts that you can take while you wait for your food. Fun! 

The space was clean and I liked the decor for a fast food place. The layout in the store was odd though. We had a couple of people try to get in through the exit and since we sat near that door we had to point them to the correct door. I wish both doors would have just opened. Maybe this is an issue at a busy lunch hour. 

I'll go back but certainly infrequently because my waistline couldn't handle that too often."}
{"text":"The best burgers ever!  I love this place will always return to have a burger with free toppings.  Yes free toppings no extra charge. I highly recommend eating at Five Guy's if you are craving a juicy burger."}
{"text":"The food is good, but a little overpriced. For $15 I could buy two meals someplace else. So is it good? Yes. But is it worth paying double? No."}
{"text":"Was craving a great burger for dinner and had heard a lot about Five Guys but never been.  I decided to try them out.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and fries.  I was pretty disappointed that they didn't sell shakes.  Scratch that.  I was very disappointed that they didn't sell shakes.  I was actually kind of surprised.  I can't remember the last burger joint I was in that didn't have shakes.  The food did take a while to arrive but the burger was definitely worth the wait.  Best fast food burger I've had in a long time.  Definitely better than In'N'Out in my opinion.  However, the fries were some of the worst I've ever tried.  Anywhere.  And I've had french fries in a hospital cafeteria.  That's saying a lot.  I don't think they were fully cooked and they were so drowned in oil they felt soggy in my mouth.  I don't know if it was this location or what. So that paired with the fact they don't serve shakes is the reason I'm giving them 3 stars.  Service was good and burger was amazing though."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Five Guys. The burgers and toppings are bountiful and fresh; the fries are perfectly salty and cut with some skin left on; the soda machine provides pretty much every combination of anything you could ever think of; and, the free peanuts are a good way to pass the time and a hit with kids. This location can get a bit busy due to its location at the Waterworks (and in between other food options) - but I've never waited more than 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"This is the best of all the Five Guys Burgers that I have tried. Visited on Sunday Oct 23rd at 2pm. The restaurant is spotless and the staff was amazing.

The manager is charge is a terrific leader and Five Guys should use her to train all restaurants. She personally thanked everybody that came into her restaurant. And she always had a smile!!

The burger was prepared quickly and tasty. We will be back! And a big thank you right back at the manager and her staff!"}
{"text":"My 1st time here and it wasnt my last. The Cashier greeted me and was cheerful. Its way better than In And Out and Fat Burger. They dump the fries in a Bag and its enough fries for 2 people. The Beef tastes fresh and is juicy. The Cheese is thick but a lil runny on the ends. I enjoyed every bite of my burger. Only thing that they should add to the menu are Shakes and Onion Rings."}
{"text":"This was my husbands first visit to Five Guys and he's a big fan of In-N-Out so I wanted to see what he thought. Their burgers are flavorful and they allow you to add as many topping as you want for free. According to my husband there (cajun) fries \"are the best ever!\" We will definitely be back to Five Guys."}
{"text":"Five Guys is awesome!! Burgers are always hot fresh and delicious.  Will try this location today for the first time but other locations , Arbor Dr, Ballantyne, and Monroe, have fast service and wonderfully friendly staff! Never had a bad meal!!! Go back again and again. Will update with another review of this location after I enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I've only visited the Murrysville location and there is no way it even comes close to In N Out Burger. The food is extremely greasy -so much so that it drips off the burger as you eat it. The fries are greasy too and not at all crispy. The \"free\" toppings were gross-bacon full of fat, soggy mushrooms-must be all the grease). Worst of all-the prices are not reasonable. I'm not sure why other reviewers are even comparing the two- In N Out is more fast food-Five Guys seems more restaurant style-no drive through etc. Anyway there must be a better option for burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Just opened but already looking dingy. Cheap looking store. Terrible impersonal and unfriendly service punctuated by people shouting at one another and someone calling out numbers in a  piercing shrill voice. If they turned the music down it would have helped. Staff seemed harried, stressful and and unhappy. Not impressed seeing bandages hanging off one person and another continually wiping his nose with his arm. Mediocre burger with a soggy, crushed bun and messy processed cheese. There was an abundance of fries (and good fries too), - but they spilled everywhere and coated the bag and my hands in grease. If you are going to do a large fries portion, get containers that the actually fit in. I prefer not to eat from the bottom of a bag.Never did get a cup for the drink I ordered. Server shouted something about peanuts but i had no idea what she was talking about. Entirely not worth $16.00."}
{"text":"To their credit, even though I checked the box that said NO NEED to be contacted, their regional manager contacted me to let me know that they used my feedback as a 'training moment' and offered me a return visit on them. 

Its good to see a company take constructive criticism to heart and address it."}
{"text":"These are the BEST FRIES EVER!  The small size is enough for two people. The burgers were really good. The patties tasted homemade, the toppings were delicious, and the bun was soft and mostly held together. Messy at the halfway point, so maybe not the best first-date choice for a quick dinner before a movie. The music was really loud, and that's what cost the two stars. Give it a try. A single patty and a double patty,one small fries, one drink = $20"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today and the fries are AMAZING!!  Nothing I hate worse than cold fries and these were soooo hot and fresh!  We ordered the medium size fries to split between the  two of us but you could easily split them between 4 people.  The service was extremely fast and the food was fresh and hot.  The burgers were made to order (which I really liked) but just an OK burger, nothing special.  They use shredded lettuce on their burgers and I prefer a lettuce leaf but other than that, the other toppings were plentiful, fresh and amazing."}
{"text":"In the past I've shied away from reviewing chains, but i can't really say why that's been the case; so...

Five Guys is a fun option if you're in a burger and fires sort of mood and even more so if you have the chance to stick around in the store for a while. Free peanuts while you're in the shop are pretty sweet and can be just the thing to get you ready for a delicious burger. 

I pretty much always go for the bacon cheeseburger option (which is actually served double decker). This is not for the faint of heart, but it is a very filing and tasty choice if you're running on empty stomach-wise. You're encouraged to choose multiple toppings from a fairly diverse list at Five guys and I tend to go for grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, extra pickles, mustard, and hot sauce. This yields quite a large, delicious, and messy sandwich. The bacon at Five Guys is very crispy (perhaps even too much so) but this works well against very nice, soft sesame seed buns. All of this comes wrapped up in foil and actually travels quite well if you're taking it to go. 

The fries at Five Guys are great as well. These are made fresh in house and each location will display where the potatoes they're using one any particular day were grown. Fires come regular (just salt) or Cajun and I ALWAYS go for the Cajun option. Spicy, salty, crunchy, starchy; these are a winner! When you order fries at Five Guys you will get a LOT of fries. Essentially you will get either a small or regular size beverage cup full of fries, plus a heaping scoop of 'extra' fries dumped right into the bag for good measure. If you love finding a 'bonus' fry in the bag during the drive home Five Guys will definitely be your thing! 

The other good options on the menu are basically hotdogs and sodas, so don't come hear looking for infinite choices (although the various topping combinations do increase diversity). The service tends to be quite customer friendly, although you may hear the workers being a little saucy to one another. The music is sometimes a little on the loud side, but is usually good (mostly classic rock). The prices are on the average to high side for fast casual restaurants but you do get a fair amount of food for the price. 

This particular location of Five Guys is my favorite due to proximity to my home, but I've found the consistency from location to location (including those in airports!) to be very high. In some ways I'm sort of glad Five Guys doesn't serve beer; I think if they did I might end up spending a LOT of time (and money) hanging out here..."}
{"text":"Five Guys offers a decent burger, but it's definitely overcooked--they brag about serving them well done and there's no argument here: that's what they are. But I much prefer the flavor of Smashburger's meat. Five Guys seemed rather devoid of meaningful seasoning, or if it was there, it was killed in the well-doneing. 

I also didn't really like that it comes out as two carelessly charred mini-patties, instead of one, nicely cooked and seasoned burger.

As far as Mill-area burgers are concerned, I'm at the following:
1.Smashburger  2. Chuckbox 3.  In N Out 4. Five Guys 5. Fatburger

And Chuckbox and Smashburger are awfully close. I've been a HUGE fan of Chuckbox for forever, so many I like the newness of Smashburger, but damn is it tasty. I also prefer the Smashfries to Chuckbox's fries, but I think I prefer 5 Guys' fries to both of them.

Finally, the price is obnoxious. You're not getting that much in the way of a burger for $11 (drink + fries + cheeseburger). You get a MOUNTAIN of fries, but I don't NEED that many fries. You also get to top it with just about anything, but I don't want to subsidize other people's toppings. Let me pay $2 less to get mine with lettuce, ketchup, and mayo.

Overall a meh burger. Not great, but better than Fatburger, if I don't want to walk to College for great burgerness.

Oh, as for atmosphere, it was like a club in there. I really don't need to be bombarded with music at lunch when I'm going to talk to someone. I hate shouting and the few times when the song would switch and the grill would quiet was like the eye of the storm. Turn that shit down."}
{"text":"Yes, their burgers are great, but their fries are lacking.  If they went with something like Fat Burger's skinny fries, this would be my one stop burger shop."}
{"text":"For $10.76, I got a \"little bacon cheeseburger\", fries, and a drink I refilled at least 4 times to make myself believe I got my money's worth today.
The burger was good.  It reminds me of what burgers taste like when I make them at home.  The ingredients seemed to be fresh and not premade in a laboratory somewhere where babies are tortured.  The burger was definitely tasty.  I can't say it was worth $5 though.
The fries were ok.  They are thick and soft inside.  I like my fries crispier.  Honestly, they were very bland.
I could see Chili's out the window and told everyone there I'd rather spend the same amount of money on a burger and fries there.  At least someone would refill my drink for me, bring me my food, and I'd be in a booth where people can't bump my chair while picking up their food because they're too lazy to walk around the table to the side where there's enough space for them to get through.
The decor consists of sacks of potatoes, plain tables, and white walls covered in raving reviews.  They should think about decorating with something other than the reviews so it doesn't let down their customers' high expectations."}
{"text":"I can't believe Yelp! didn't even have a listing for this Five Guys location so, here I am, to the rescue, as usual.

Anyway, no surprises here.  Five Guys serves up great burgers, a metric tonne of free toppings, and all the delicious fries you need to soak up a ream of napkins with grease.  In a world obsessed with the latest diet crazes and fast-food chains trying to act like purveyors of granola/hippie crap, Five Guys is a refreshing departure and sticks to what they do best: delicious, greasy burgers and fries, period."}
{"text":"American diner as tasty and authentic as they come! Crash landed in Liverpool, this quirky American themed fast food restaurant sits in the prime location at the Queen's Square bus station, where the Rat&Parrot has sat derelict for years. 
On entering the restaurant, make sure you know what you are ordering. It's very simple: burger or hot dog, fries (not chips) and a drink or milkshake. Then you add your free extras from a carefully selected list of free toppings. I went for the cheese burger with relish and mushrooms, then small fries and a drink. You then wait for your order while about 15 workers scramble about in an organised chaos to make these burger.
My first thoughts were - this is going to be a disaster. But I was mistaken. It was awesome. 
I waited about 3 minutes for my self created burger to be handed to me in their iconic brown bag. I then went to the touch-screen drink dispenser(free refills) which to my astonishment had every fizzy and non-fizzy drink I never even imagined. They must import them. It was like Charlie and the Fizzy Pop factory. I got Diet Coke Vanilla. I've never seen that before. 
When we found a table I ripped open my brown paper bag, unwrapped my burger and that when the clouds of heaven opened. Juicy double patty cheese dripping heaven. It could be the new best burger in Liverpool. Seriously. Gorgeous. 
I got the small fries which were the equivalent of a super-sized Macdonalds- no complaints there. Good chips. Fries. They're also fried in peanut oil. So nut allergies beware, it's worth the epi-pen.. 
My only mistake was to not get a milkshake. The milkshakes have their own American woman who makes them. And they look awesome. I saw a few quivering faces after their first sip across the restaurant. Next time I promise. 
A bit more expensive than your normal fast food takeaway, but this place is far from normal. Top notch quality systems evidently in place. I will be back. Every day. Breakfast. Lunch. Tea. And Tea2."}
{"text":"The worst burger I have eaten in a long time. I came here bc I was craving five guys and when it was ready the bottom bun was so soggy and unable to pick up as a burger. When I complained the \"manager?\" Said it was bc it was from the over applied bbq sauce. Terrible burger and terrible customer service"}
{"text":"Went to Five Guys on a recommendation and did not think I was going to like it because I WAS a huge fan of In N Out. Holy Moly did I change my mind fast.

Free peanuts= awesome. You can chow down on peanuts while you wait for your kick ass burger. I ordered the little cheeseburger and Cajun fries. The little burger was actually big in my standards. I am glad I ordered that size. 

It was so fresh and juicy, the toppings (and there are many to choose from) were fresh and crisp. The Cajun fries are ridiculous, big, spicy and oh so good. 

This place beats In N Out in my mind. I haven't even been back since I discovered Five guys. I love this location and the people are funny and nice. It is also clean, which is god because I am a little OCD on the cleaning. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I had read somewhere that Five Guys have the best burgers around so I was out doing errands and stopped by to get a takeout for lunch at the Power Rd., Mesa store..  This was my first time in the restaurant.  What's with the huge bags of potatoes when you first walk in?? I turned right when I should have turned left trying to get to the counter around the bags and there were so many tables crammed in, it was hard to maneuver through.  I got a regular burger, which is really a double burger...should have got the small burger with one patty.  Okay, so it is a pretty large burger and they have a lot of free toppings.  It COULD be a great burger...but, they fold them too tightly in aluminum foil and the guy literally smashed the bun to a skinny mushy mess.  The fries could be really great too if they weren't so over salted.  I wouldn't mind ordering them again and asking for no salt.  After I got my order, I tried to get out of the place.  I wondered..should I go back through the order line against the wall that is all closed in with huge stacks of bags..no, couldn't do that because a long line had gathered...so again worked my way through the tables, everybody trying to move for me."}
{"text":"I babysat my best friend's kids for the day and as a thank you she treated me to dinner at this place. I've never been here before but heard mixed reviews on this place. The place was clean, the server/cashier was friendly and helpful, and best of all the burger and cajun fries were delicious! Thank you 5 guys!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger spot. They have fresh hand made burgers and free toppings. I get the little bacon cheese burger because the other one is to big. Their fries are also the best! Fresh cut fries. I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"This spot just opened, taking the place of a Hollywood Video that closed some time ago.  It's in stealth start-up mode; the staff is still learning and I'll give them a break.  Everything behind the counter was pretty chaotic, but they haven't officially opened and are still working out the bugs.

The burger was good, and I had it with \"the works\" so it was plenty juicy.   It wasn't outstanding, just good.  My teenaged son had his with lettuce, tomato and ketchup and he thought that it was over-rated.  The fries are fresh cut, fried and served in a cup.  Most certainly not crispy, more like greasy.  They actually are kind of limp and, well, icky as they sit in the cup and steam.  Definitely the low point of our visit.

I'm giving it 2 stars for now.  I hope they open strong and improve their product, as I find In-and-Out services a superior burger and fries.  I'll go back in a few months after they work the bugs out.  They have to, or this place will be boarded up again."}
{"text":"I thought that 2pm on a Tuesday would be the time to go and try this place since it is normally jammed pack. The wait was non-existent, so I placed an order for a small cheeseburger with grilled onions, mushrooms, green peppers, and BBQ sauce. The burger alone was almost five dollars, so it is on the pricey side for fast food. If you want to add fries and a drink it can run pass ten dollars.

The burgers are made to order, so we sat down and snacked on some peanuts while waiting. When my order came up, I was called up by a friendly attendant. Unwrapping it, there was a pool of grease already forming. All the ingredients had very little flavor and the only thing I was aware of was how much oil I was ingesting with every bite. I could see the BBQ sauce, but could not taste it.  

Everything from the helpful employees to the good location makes me want to like this place, but there are other chains that produce a better product. If the meat had more flavor, less grease, it would be delicious, because it is juicy. The bun is soft, but just soaks up the wrong flavor. I normally complain about places over seasoning their food, but the grilled vegetables lacked essence."}
{"text":"Slow service. Super slow. Off time at 3:30. Three people in line. After ten minutes not even the toppings on the burger are ready. Come on guys. You claim to be thankful for customers. Sure doesn't show."}
{"text":"So a Five Guys opened recently near my place of work, I had been to a Five Guys only once before and wasn't too impressed but I was willing to give it another try since most of the girls I work with love it.
We placed our order on line and prepaid before we left so we'd have more time to eat and chat than stand around waiting. Well it didn't work out that simply. The girl at the counter was giving us the total we needed to pay,  had to explain that we already had, we were just here to pick it up. It took some effort to get our cups from her then after wewalked away, called us back over to give us receipts with numbers that we should listen for to be called. 5 minutes later, no food, so we asked the guy that was handing out the food, apparently our food was sitting back there all this time...how were we suppose to know!? 
The food was okay, like my first experience, nothing special, it's a no frills burger with out much taste. Same with the fries, I prefer my fries to be crispier. The friend I was with got the wrong topping on her burger than what she ordered, she also got it without the bun and it wasn't wrapped very well so it was a bit difficult to eat, she said she'll opt for the burger in a bowl next time.
Staff was nice and even brought us extra fries for our troubles. The place was very busy, but it was kept clean as well.
Love the multi-option soda machine and the peanuts.
Five Guys isn't really my favorite, so I won't be visiting much."}
{"text":"Since they opened in Vegas, I've been wanting to see what all the hype was about, I've been hearing about it across the country; how its the best burger.
Since it was my first experience I like to go with a plain cheeseburger, if it can stand alone without a bunch of toppings, that will bump you up on my \"best\" list.
What I initially didn't like was the greasy smell in the restaurant, when we left I smelled like I just got done a shift there. YUCK!
Well the burger was good, lots of hot gooey cheese, the bun was soft and fresh. Tasted a little bland, so I doubt they season their meat, so it tasted like a burger you may get at a family barbecue or an amusement park. I'd eat it again, but I would choose Smashburger over 5 Guys any day. We got the plain fries, which were pretty gross, they were brown and greasy not crisp at all, we ate maybe 10 fries and threw the rest away.
I liked that they had a bucket of peanut to snack on while waiting for your burger. Staff was nice and helpful, andswered all my \"firsttimer\" questions."}
{"text":"Fresh burgers that taste homemade, made to order with any topping. Fresh cut fries - Plain or Seasoned, they're delicious.  

Friendly service - Free peanuts - Annoyingly loud metal chairs that people drag around as they sit is really hard on the ears!!

Dear owners - please fix the chairs OMG!!!"}
{"text":"I don't like this Five Guys. 

The hamburgers are insanely overcooked and was a tad on the chewy side.

But my real gripe is that this place stands on the dust of the Coffee Plantation. A job that saw me through my twenties. Great memories. Reduced to chewy overcooked hamburger.

I might forgive you for moving on Tempe. Maybe one day. I might even like the hockey puck texture on the over blasted meat at Five Guys. 

Maybe one day.

Maybe one day."}
{"text":"There are 3 famous premium burger chains in US. Shake shak burger, in &out and 5guys. Pittsburgh has two of 5 guys and I went to the one near by U. Pitt. 

Its burger is amazing. You can see fresh ingredients on the picture I attached. So tasty and Sooo Huge. They provided diverse topping options but I simply chose \"everything \". 

Its potato was totally different from others in a great way. Although its amount was really big, I didn't make any leftovers. Rich flavor and crispy texture stimulated my appetite.  

Don't forget about savory peanuts! You can try for free."}
{"text":"I get a cheeseburger with Jalape√±os and Bacon. That's how I roll. These guys do It well.

 This place is better than In n Out but not as good as Freddys. All in all, very good! 

Not a fan of the fries or the fact they don't grill the Jalape√±os."}
{"text":"I liked the free peanuts, in the shell, that you can eat if you want. The burger itself was ok. It was sloppy. I ordered a junior cheeseburger one with jalape√±os and onions and it was my first time at 5 guys. They're sloppy burgers, nothing special. The cheese was standard and processed and the jalape√±os weren't pickled and soft, they were sliced thick and raw. The onions weren't long circles, they were diced and caramelized so they fell out. I don't get the hype around this place but I love burgers so I shall return one day and order a larger burger with different toppings and perhaps some greasy fries to go with my sloppy burger. If I wasn't working out and eating clean all the time I'd go here more probably I guess."}
{"text":"So my friend was trying to convince me that Five Guys was a pretty good option to 'fast food', but in the end, industrialized conveyor belt food is just that. You can kitsch it, theme it, and hype it any way you like, but fast food is fast food.

After an outing at a flea market, we decided to give Five Guys a try. Well, I was trying it, he had been there before. On first glance, it kind of looked like a big warehouse of red and white tile, with piles of potato and peanut bags in a long line between the door and the ordering counter, and a big 'look how cool our themed 50's malt shop array of tables and chairs are' seating area. Tons of big red signs bragging about their wares, with quotes from newspapers and magazines around the country, lining the windows and walls.

We approached the ordering counter, and ordered. One large bacon cheeseburger, with lettuce, tomato and mushrooms, with mayo. They didn't have a dark mustard, only the day-glo ballpark wiener mustard, so I opted out of that. The very friendly and pleasant clerk didn't ask how I might want it cooked. Seems they just do that their way.

My friend ordered a basic burger, and an order of fries to share. And we each got a soda (Coke people, thank goodness...after hiking a big flea market, a Diet Coke was high priority).

$23. And we were number 30.

The number was called out, and our food came. Two burgers in foil, marked \"#1\" and \"#2\", tucked into a greasy paper bag that also contained a paper cup filled with fries, and the bottom of the bag lined with spillover from the rest of the fries. I have to agree with another reviewer who commented on the wasteful use of the cup, as well as the 'take out' nature of the 'dining in' experience. Just put them in the bag, or on a plastic reusable tray. Save a tree...or an entire forest.

Unwrap, and bite in. It was a burger. A one slight step above an average fast food burger. The difference was that it wasn't a frozen hockey puck burger, like the rest of the McFoods, but it was a 'hand formed' patty, as all of their promotional materials raved about. Was if actually from a bag of fresh ground beef? Considering the grey pallor of the finished burger, I had my doubts.  The cheese was your basic square of American processed cheese, the bacon was...well...bacon, the mushrooms seemed liked sizzled canned, the lettuce and tomato were fine, and the bun your general average sesame seeded hamburger bun.  The taste was better than the usual McWhopper, but not by much.

The fries were very greasy, but were at least real potatoes, versus the playdoh bioengineered variety at the other McFood joints. They didn't taste bad, and I opted for some of the cajun seasoning to sprinkle on my half, which made them a little zingier. But they really were just average fries.

Honestly, with the royalty of Winghart's available, and the next step down of Burgatory, why waste money on something that is 'just ok'? Step it up, drive another block, and go for the gold. Brass is just brass.

Theme-ing doesn't satisfy the tastebuds."}
{"text":"Ce sont mes cheeseburgers-bacon favoris sur l'√Æle, ind√©logeables!

Juste un petit commentaire √† propos de notre commande d'hier soir.  Mon amoureux et moi avons demand√© la m√™me chose, simplement avec des garnitures diff√©rentes. Au moment de d√©baller nos sandwichs, le mien √©tait un \"petit\" alors que le sien √©tait un \"r√©gulier\". Est-ce que c'√©tait une d√©cision arbitraire du caissier, puisque je suis une femme? J'esp√®re que j'ai tort, mais je ne vois pas du tout qu'est-ce qu'il aurait pu avoir mal compris. De plus, nous √©tions seuls et les garnitures √©taient les bonnes, alors ce n'est pas une erreur au moment d'assembler les commandes. 

Au final, bon, clairement personne ne ressort de chez Five Guys affam√©, mais je me suis moins \"bourr√©e la face\" que j'en avais envie :("}
{"text":"Five Guys is pretty new on the scene on Mill and fits in very well with the college style and crowd that it will cater to.  This place is by no means a gourmet restaurant, but they put out decent food at a decent price.
The inside is very well lit and very clean with white tiled walls with red highlights and free peanuts for snacking on.  Service is quick and friendly with food being made as it is ordered.
My burger was well cooked, but not dry and overdone; well prepared and still juicy.  The toppings are very fresh and can be picked to suit with a large variety.  Being able to just pick and choose your toppings to your heart's desire is kind of a neat aspect of this place and gives the customer the ability to customize their burger.  The fries were the weakest part of the meal since they were a bit on the soggy side and left room for improvement.  I did like the choice of regular fries or cajun, which gave the fries a bit more flavor and taste and actually bumped up fries a bit.  However, I really like my fries to be a bit more crispy and less soggy/limp."}
{"text":"Started out with Cheese Burger and Fries and after I ate the first burger I had order another it was good, I couldn't stop, I got a third burger!   BAM those Burgers were awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff and service, but five guys goes beyond their world class service to deliver world class cheeseburgers.

The ingredients are fresh and compliment the high quality meat and cheese in a way only your taste buds can understand.

If you are in the mood for a delectable, five star, burger give five guys your business"}
{"text":"I love coming here!! I like being.able to customize my burger with so many toppings including A-1 sauce which just make the burgers fantastic. Huge portions of fries that usually have my family of four splitting a large order."}
{"text":"Tasty! Very tasty! Ok so I've never been to the East Coast and I'm an Arizona Native so the only comparison for this burger joint is other burger joints in the valley. 

The burger is actually a double, you order the toppings individually, and they have the standards. They make it in front of you which is nice. The pattys were tasty and the buns were some of the best on a burger i've ever had!! Fries were good as well.

We ordered two burgers, one side of fries and one drink and the total was $18.xx. Expensive? Well it's more expensive than McDonalds of course but not more than a restaurant, it's a good middle ground. I think you pay for the quality. I definitely don't mind paying extra for a great tasting quality burger! 

The decore was......um....interesting. Pretty white everywhere. Peanuts as an appetizer?!? And on the wall was non-local reviews. I rather have local reviews but that's all minor. I went to get a good tasting non-fast food chain burger and that's what I got. I'm happy, and will be returning, probably several times. 

FYI-If they had alcohol, they would have gotten 5 stars from me. (It'd be nice for \"fast food, sit down joints\" to take a page out of the Chipotle handbook) umk that's all."}
{"text":"Came here Friday night with my family. Ive never really tried these artisan burgers before, but have always been curious about it.  First impression is that is was very simple and clean place.  The menu was clear cut, just burgers and fries.  Unlike those other burger joints with massive menus.

Pros
You can tell the difference with their burgers, the patties tasted fresh and juicier. All the condements tasted like they were prepared that day. The fries were prepared per order.  Over all the food was very satisfactory.

Con
So for a family of 5 people we paid $70, thats five burgers, five fountain drinks and and large fries.  For that amount of money i couldve eaten at a decent restaurant.  I wouldve been better if they had combo with the burgers.  Eventhough the burgers were good, i dont think its worth almost $10.

Overall the experience was good, but im not willing to spend $70 everytime we go. Atleast i can say that i have eaten there."}
{"text":"The Bacon Cheeseburger:  Two burgers, very filling. 
The Fries: Wonderful Potato taste.
The staff: efficient.

The price:  $12.49 for a burger, fries and drink?  Outrageous!
The parking:  Located in a small four business center, the parking lot was full at the 11 a.m. opening."}
{"text":"Conveniently next to the mall and school, this place makes a lot of business. I've been here twice and I like the amount of toppings they offer. The burgers take awhile to make as the parties are grilled to order so they come out hot and juicy. Their fries are unique since they use peanut oil and the also give free peanuts, which is what they are known for!"}
{"text":"I've been to other Five Guys locations before. But this one is literally a few steps from work. At first it seems like a normal 5 Guys. The familiar white and red decor and the view into the cooking area as these guys put together your meal. However, this one location stood out. It wasn't the food (although it was just as good as other Five Guys locations that I've been to... read: Its good); but as soon as the line was done, We were greeted by the cashier, and were asked how our meal was, and whether anything could be done to improve it. That little gesture made a huge impression on me. Way to go. Try getting that kind of attention at any other fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"My Son took his dad there on Father's Day as a treat and was treated the worst! The employees on staff all standing around talking about their night drinking and sex with profane music playing was hardly the example of a family restaurant. When my son went to the counter to let the young man know that he never received the bacon he ordered the young man said \" Are you sure it isn't on there I'm pretty sure I put it\" my son opened the burger to show him there was none he then went to the back to get him a side of bacon. He ten returned with a small bowl of grease dripping bacon scraps! Disgusting he then asked to speak with a manager the young man then said we don't have a manager tonight. When I called today the manager Christina said there was nothing she could do since the cameras showed that they gave him bacon! Too many choices to eat to spend 50$$ on a terrible dinner! Customer service ran by a bunch of unsupervised kids!"}
{"text":"Freakin love this place. Service is always good. Takes a little while to actually get your food. But we'll worth it!!

Also it's pretty expensive. So we only go there once every 2-3 months. But we look forward to it every time we go."}
{"text":"Good burgers!! As always five guys quality was very good!! Better than any other fast food burgers franchise ... I love the peanuts they have!! And the service was very fast and friendly ..."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Once you've gone double-pattied, it's hard to go back.

Five Guys finally made its way up here, and I gotta say, it's one solid burger! Their \"regular\" burger comes double-pattied, so order the \"little\" burger if you only want to clog your arteries halfway! You can add bacon, cheese or both, but either way, you're getting a lot of bang for your buck here. On top of that, you get a choice of a all the classic burger toppings including grilled mushrooms and jalapenos - sweet!

But of course, and as other Yelpers have already trumpeted, the CAJUN FRIES is where it's at - there's basically no reason to even offer the regular fries. These fries are a must-try!"}
{"text":"You can get a good feel for a business when you come in during off hours in the middle of the week, that said, five guys rocks! 

The guys working the counter were light-hearted and genuine. The burgers were moist and light, the veggies were fresh and flavorful. 

The fries were pretty close to perfect, I like mine a little more well done. I imagine they would probably have cooked them that way, had I asked....

In a state where in and out burgers are just a pipe dream, five guys has won my heart and devotion.  I'd probably come back just for the free peanuts."}
{"text":"Tout d'abord, j'avais beaucoup d'attentes pour Five Guys Hamburgers et Frites. Premi√®rement, TOUTES les huiles v√©g√©tales sont sans cholest√©rol. L'usage de l'huile d'arachide est fonction de sa tol√©rance √† la chaleur ET son prix. Rien de plus. Pour la sant√©, on repassera. Ensuite, pour 15$ par personne SANS POSSIBILIT√â de TRIO, c'est tr√®s √©lev√© pour des frites r√©guli√®res √† 3,29 $, une boisson √† 1,99 $. Les frites ne pr√©sentent aucun avantage particulier pour justifier 3,29 $. Elles viennent d'ailleurs de tr√®s loin, en g√©n√©ral (I.P.E., Can.). Un cheeseburger tout garni avec fromage et bacon pour 7,99 $ avec deux boulettes de viande s√®che sans jus, sans humidit√©, c'est trop et encore inutile, le tout dans un emballage de papier d'aluminium NON RECYCLABLE.... tr√®s peu √† envier √† St-Hubert ! Donc, verdict. On passe √† un autre.

First of all, I had a lot of expectations for Five Guys Hamburgers and fries. The choice of peanut oil for cooking is only for heat tolerance and low price nothing more. No cholesterol is present in ALL vegetable oils. Second, 15 $ per person is very steep if you compare to many other joints, .... NO TRIO POSSIBILITY ! 3,29 $ for one regular fries, with no particular taste difference compare to other variations on the fries. Why so high ? They come usually from very far, ex. P.E.I. Can.... do the math. One soft drink, regular, 1,99 $. One cheeseburger, double meat patty, unpleasantly dry, not juicy, not moist, served in a simple flat aluminium foil. Not recyclable, Not comparable to St-Hubert, the chicken place who understood. Bottom line for 15.25 $, it's a major pass ! NEXT !"}
{"text":"Great burgers. You can customize to have whatever you want on them. The cheeseburger is pretty big with two patties, the little cheeseburger just had one patty and is satisfying too. Just depends how hungry you are. 

Free peanuts are great to munch on while you wait for your order too. I will say the fries are pretty lame.. just not my style I guess. I always skip them. But the burgers more than make up for it. The grilled cheese is pretty awesome too - and you can add toppings to it as well if you don't want meat. 

Friendly staff and the place is always clean. A little pricey but worth it in my opinion, especially when it comes to fast food."}
{"text":"Another solid give guys location. On par with other locations, friendly service and consistent taste. 

I love that you can get peanuts at this place, I don't really like their fries so it's nice to have something to snack on before the burgers are ready. 

Huge portions: little cheeseburger is a single patty and regular cheeseburger is two. You can order whichever toppings you want at no additional charge. I love the customization options at this chain. 

Clean interior, AC blasting in the summer, decent music playing. Nice place to stop and grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I've had five guys burgers before and as always, they are great!!  The regular size fries is enough for 3 or even 4 to share. They have malt vinegar for the fries so don't miss out on that."}
{"text":"I ordered the bacon cheese burger with regular fries and a drink which totaled $11.99.  The burger was juicy and very tasty.  The burger was almost worth the $6.39 I spent on it.  The fries were, well kind of meh.  For $2.39 for an order of fries they should double fry them.  The fries were crispy on the outside, but not light and fluffy on the inside like great fries should be.  No where near the best fries I have ever had.  I don't see what everyone else is raving about.  This is just another burger joint to me.  The burgers are good, the fries not so good, so overall average.  Would I go back, probably not."}
{"text":"Nobody in line when we walked in, but the three employees decided only one of them could take an order so they took a phone order instead...
Would have been a bit more pleasant if the younger female employee and the person, who I'm assuming was the manager on duty, weren't in the back playing around with each other instead of letting the meat patties overcook on the griddle. Way to go kids."}
{"text":"The concept is order the way you like it, simple yet smart, giving you options.  Is is unique?  It must be as they seem to be growing at a fast past, popping up all over Vegas valley.

I like my burger grilled, with cheese and crispy bacon, lettuce, tomato, onions and some pickles.  I like mayo and ketchup, no mustard.  I'll say this place gives it to me just like I like.  The burger patty is consistently even in thickness, cooked well, and the burger is put together well.  I don't care for the fries, I think they over cook them, but I am not much of a \"fry\" eater.

The lines can be long, the dinning room crowded, but it moves quickly.  If you like peanuts, you can pass the time shucking some, I usually get a handful, it's free!  the noise level can be deafening, as the staff are always yelling out and the makes everyone else raise their voices to compensate.  As for price, I think it's a little higher than most burger joints, but the burger is worth it."}
{"text":"Two patties made by hand, slightly irregular size put on flat top grill until medium well done. Cheese placed between the two patties and then placed on the grilled bun, the rest of the burger is is to you! 

I like basic, bacon, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle, and onions. It took about 15 minutes to prepare, my husband and I split an order of fries, they're cut thick with skin on, dusted with Cajun seasoning, just out of the frier, very hot. 

We had two burgers, one large fries, one large drink and it was $20, a little steep for burgers! But I enjoyed it, can't say if $20bucks worth of enjoyment, but then, I got complimentary peanuts while I waited on the burgers. 

I'll put this on my list of burger joints, this place is ahead of some, but isn't my absolute fav!"}
{"text":"My absolute fave burger joint in Vegas! I know exactly what to expect when I come here. Double bacon cheeseburger with a slew of toppings - I love that they do grilled onions and mushrooms as a topping, as well as the classics like pickles, lettuce, tomato. I love that they have 2 size options that are both incredibly filling. The strawberry shake has delicious chunks of strawberry which I enjoy. Service is always friendly and it's great to see your food being made fresh. Love the bun and and quality of all the ingredients. For a classic burger with a large portion size - this is THE spot!!"}
{"text":"There's a difference, BIG difference, between a Burger and the Little Burger. I accidentally, thankfully, ordered the Burger that came with pickles, lettuce, mushrooms and it came out STACKED! The medium-sized fries was so big, took both of us to chow it down and we still couldn't finish. 

The burgers are freshly made, no preservatives, fries are fried in peanut oil, which is high in antioxidants, full of nutrients, including calories and (H-ealthyDLs cholesterol), not LDLs, which make the fries so very tasty. They even have peanuts as appetizers for FREE. 

This was my first time here and I'm definitely returning with a few more people!"}
{"text":"Wish i could have saved my 10.00 and used it to buy ANYTHING Else.

So i was really psyched and excited to go and eat my first 5 guys burgers. I had heard great things and i was in the mood for some good juicy BEEF. Yum.

The catch is. I dont eat gluten...so the buns were out of the question for me. BUT! i was told that 5 guys had this thing called a lettcue bun. Basically they take large lettuce leaves and wrap it around your burger! I was soo excited. I get there, i place my order... i wait.... i recieve my order.. and they litterally plopped a dried up beef patty into a take out container with lettuce under it, the topping and ketchup on the side. I was so sad. The saddest ive been in a long time. The beef was dry and cold. The bacon topping sucked. It was the worst burger ever. 

When i came to work to tell my coworkers one of them told me that they had a similar experience where they had to FIGHT the store to do a lettuce bun properlly (apparently they do this in their other stores).... after complaining they got it done right. Guys... i get it you hate your job...your lazy...cant be bothered...dont think ill notice...whatever the reason is.... BUT what was served to me this sad day was horrible and I will never be back. 

Save the money and go else where. ALSO. my dining companion had a burger with a bun. She found the meat also flavurless and dry. And no i dont think your free peanuts are cool. like peanuts??? really. are we elephants now!??! Weird business model."}
{"text":"I always love the burgers here at this five guys location. I've been to quite a few and this one is also relatively quick for the amount of people that come in. For a restaurant that serves shelled peanuts they manage to keep up the floors surprisingly clean. On a Sunday night there was quite a few staff members working- 7 that I could count- almost out numbering the number of guests.  Maybe it was training night? Either way the food is really good and I will continue to return."}
{"text":"Fast service and super good food! I've eaten here twice and both times the food came out pretty fast! Super clean and surprisingly big inside! I love the soda choices how there is so many! Clean bathrooms which is a huge plus for a mall! Super yummy food! Worth the money and they definitely give you a lot of fries for one meal so you definitely can share the food here!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a hefty burger or hotdog to satisfy your greasy cravings then this is definitely a place to dine in. It's a bit pricey, I got a bacon dog with \"little fries\" and it came up to 10$. Its very filling and sooo good so I'll be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"so check this out. I went to the one in henderson with my daughter it was really really good and fresh. This place here is extremely terrible. They gave me a sogey bun, rotten tomatoes and old hard fries ouver salted like the poured a bucket over it,So, I get loud at time cause iam from the midwest we like talking with our hands,and stuff. Anyways, I brought the french fries up telling them they were terrible. Young dumb girl working there telling me not to talk this way lol. than I bring my burger up,and showed her what the hell is up with it? She informed me they dont do refunds to call corporate. so I'll be calling them tomorrow and finding out the truth about this young dumb teenager. Secondly I turned my video on,on my cellphone,and I told her Iam recording. all because I said that she says that she was going to refuse giving me a fresh order. Sucks to be on camera cause the truth comes out!!! Anyways. AVOID this place if you can,its not worth the price!!!"}
{"text":"Ok how can you not give 5 guys a 5 star review?  I don't eat here often (I'll explain why in a minute) but when I do its seriously delicious. You walk in and a normal cheeseburger is two patties, you have to ask for a small if you want just one. The fries are huge servings just thrown into a paper bag. The only reason I don't eat here often is I can feel my arteries clogging after eating there haha. I looked up the nutritional information one time. 970 calories for a bacon cheeseburger and 62g of fat haha but that's what makes it so good (occasionally)"}
{"text":"Finally, a burger joint that really takes the pain out of waiting in line. This was my first visit to Five Guys and I did an online web order just to see how well it would work, and how accurate and timely it would be.

By the time I got there, there was a line to the door. I was a little early so I figured I would not press the issue of timeliness too much, but I did tell them that I had a web order. My wait time was very short, just ebough time for the swift kitchen team to whip up and cook the freshly cut fries.

The burgers were unbelievable. What's nice is that you can pre-order unlimited toppings from the website. I somewhat expected a burger 10 inches high as I ordered mine nearly all the way. However, to my surprise it was fairly compact in an foil housing and quite edible and definitely not as messy as I expected.

The fries, while freshly cut, were nothing to rave about and were not quite well done enough. A little crispier would have given them the ultimate competitive edge. I was very satisfied with my choice of the little bacon cheeseburger and in fact, I ordered another one from my phone while sitting down. That little juicy beast was ready in no time. I know it was proably not the best way to make friends with the people who were waiting in line. I ordered the burger at 6:47 pm from my phone and it was ready exactly as promised at 6:54 pm. I could not believe it and on top of that, the kitchen was slammed!

The only item missing from the menu is a milshake actually! 

The staff was very courteous, friendly and efficient and the whole restaurant was spotless as far as cleanliness goes.

If you have a craving for a juicy burger, I highly recommend Five Guys at the Zocallo Plaza in Scottdale. If you are in a hurry, you really cannot beat the online ordering system and your stomach will thank you and think you're a hero!

There's even salted peanuts in the shell if you are still hungry afterwards wa ha ha!"}
{"text":"Hurray!
The Five Guys burger domination has finally started in downtown Montreal! I can't wait for the day when all fast crappy food, corporate baddies like McDonald's, Burger Kings and Harveys have gone the way of the dodo bird. As in extinct.
While In-N-Out Burger dominates the West Coast, Five Guys has burned up the East Coast and rightly so.
A word of warning: the burgers are HUGE and very, very  filling. If you're not sure what to get on your first order, go for the smaller sized burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Real burgers!!!!!! This location is always bustling. My fav is the Jr Bacon cheeseburger....patties are juicy and tasty. Fries are from PEI - worlds best potatoes! Sorry McD's ....no comparison with the real deal!!!!"}
{"text":"My first trip to Five Guys. The register lady was quick to realize it was our first visit and offered to explain the menu. Ordered a bacon cheeseburger with some of the fixings. Asked how spicy the Cajun fries were she offered to give us the seasoning on the side.  Burger was delicious however lacked the BBQ sauce I ordered on it. The fries are actually made from real potatoes and the seasoning was superb. I'll definitely be back hopefully they get my order completely right next time!"}
{"text":"Good and tastey just not like another burgwr group which I feel it resembles. The overall experience here is decent. The place is clean and inviting.

The menu is simple and if you need assistance then the overly happy associate will be more than glad to explain the entire menu in one breath.

I chose the Jr Bacon cheese burger which is basically a normal burger with cheese and bacon opposed to their regular burger that comes with (2) patties.

Wait time wasnt terrible l. A 1/4lb burger cooked to afterlife should not take 8mins to complete start to finish.

Ill take In n Out anyday over this.."}
{"text":"Holy crap - what a disaster.  I can only pray that the ones on the east coast are better than this.  If this really is Obama's favorite place, I might have to reconsider my support of him.  I don't even know where to begin.

Let me just make a list of WTF items:
Wicked loud music with no theme or genre
A bin of peanuts that people manhandle while in line
Peanut shells on the floor
\"regular\" burgers have two patties
\"little\" burgers that are $5

Just a disaster.  Go to Smashburger, please.  You'll love it.  This place, however, is a joke.  Also, if you have a peanut allergy, I REALLY wouldn't recommend going in here."}
{"text":"Everything is always great here! Love the flavor of the burgers and seasoned fries here. Always feel welcome and wanted while here! Love that!"}
{"text":"The food is always hot and fresh and the service is friendly.  I love that I can order ahead on the app. Unfortunately a gym opened next door and now there is never any parking. Tonight I pulled in and there was already 3 cars parked illegally picking up food."}
{"text":"AWFUL.... Price so exceeded quality I can't possibly recommend this place in good conscience unless you are filthy rich, obese and love lighting cigars with paper money just for giggles.... In n Out is a better value.  The fries at Five Guys are great, but that doesn't make up for a 2.5x up charge."}
{"text":"If you want the best burger anywhere then head to Five Guys Burgers!! 
This location is brand new and they are great. I have eaten at the ones in CA, BUT are so glade they have come here to AZ. I have turned on about 15 of my friends and they all say the same thing ( NEVER GOING BACK TO IN & OUT AGAIN) . And as far as Stephen B. he has no idea what he is talking about! 

And he did get one thing right The staff is great and they always have a smile on there face.

OK now you go try them and tell me what YOU think about Five Guy's"}
{"text":"Five Guys versus In-N-Out Burger - the competition is on. 

Five Guys is a terrific burger and fries chain that started back east and has continued to branch out over the USA. It's only recently hit AZ. Word spread quickly and Five Guys has become a phenomenal success around here. If you want to spark a lively discussion, ask someone which they prefer: Five Guys or In-N-Out. It's an East Coast versus West Coast thing, yo. LOL 

Five Guys serves two sizes of burgers. The \"little burger\" is the size of a normal burger. Their \"regular\" burger is actually TWO patties. Not realizing this, on my first visit, I ordered the regular size. I couldn't finish it, so it must really be big. When you place your order, you tell them what you want on your burger. Of course they offer the usual cheese and condiments, but they offer other choices too. Almost anything you want: bacon, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, jalapenos, BBQ sauce and more. 

Their fries are good too, thickly cut and well-seasoned. They serve them in a brown paper bag. I like to add a salt packet to the whole bag and shake it around before spreading the fries out on the table. I prefer my fries a bit overdone, so when ordering I ask for them to be prepared extra crispy. Really good. 

I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on their brand new soda dispensing machine. I've never seen anything like it. (see pic) It's only got one actual dispenser, but you press the computer screen to select your beverage choice. Then it offers you the choice of adding special flavoring like lemon, vanilla, power boost, etc. The employee guys in the back said it's an urban legend that if you punch in a secret code of ingredients, then alcohol is dispensed. Pretty funny."}
{"text":"Great place to get filled up clean large inside for dining in. Very attentive staff and order was done in about 10 minutes. They don't half fill your fry box like some of the other locations. Met this cashier named Jason cool energetic young man was interacting with all the customers and other staff . Very clean inside , orderly great burgers Five Guys ! I shall return!!"}
{"text":"Burgers are good, fries are tasty, BUT the music is way to loud especially for us seniors. Wished they could tone it down a bit."}
{"text":"There's so many burger places in Las Vegas it makes it hard to rate a chain burger joint higher.  Their burgers are good, but I seem to remember the fries being better than last time I had them.  Also, there was noticeable grease on the outside of my bag.  Which I know this meal is not healthy; however, if I don't see it perhaps it's like empty see-through calories?

Their soda machine is pretty awesome!!!!  They have one of those choose your mixture of Coke with all the variations and buttons.

It's located right in front of the Las Vegas Outlet Mall and there's a ton of options right there. Canes, Chipotle, Subway, Chilis, Panda Express, etc"}
{"text":"First time being to Five guys, I was shocked at the prices at first. $4.39 for a plain hamburger. Seems high but the food is good and they don't short change you on the fries. I got a regular fries and had way more then I could stomach after my burger. Overall the the staff seems friendly and the facility is kept clean and the air cold. Make sure that you use up your complimentary token for the condiments on your burgers. That's where you get your monies worth. That is all for now."}
{"text":"We ordered online and only needed to wait on fries when we go there to pick up...that is a great idea, so they are fresh!  Staff is amazingly friendly and the food is good.  It does get a little floppy when taken out and in the bag compared to eating in the restaurant.  My only complaint...I asked for lettuce on my burger and got a piece that was smaller the a pickle slice.  Tossed it out when I got home and added my own.  Fry portion is huge!"}
{"text":"This burger was decent but I thought pricey. The fries r excellent... recommend the Cajun seasoned. The best part about the burger is all the toppings they offer and they don't skimp on them either. Also very fresh fries get 4.5 stars. Very good service."}
{"text":"The burger was good -- fresh and made to order.  The fries were over cooked and I asked if they would give me new ones, but they said that's the way they cook them.  Tasted burned. 

The price with drink, small fries and large bacon cheeseburger was above $13.  I'm pretty sure it's cheaper at N & Out.   And the fries are always cooked right there. 

Management needs to fix those fries."}
{"text":"With this location being at the centre of the universe it's always busy. I was lucky on my visit to squeak in between rushes to find only one person ahead of me in line, but 8 or so people waiting to place their order when I sat down with my food.

I found the wait here to be a little longer than my previous Five Guys experiences but the food was hot and fresh as always and worth the wait. There was a fair number of tables to choose from, though many of them were a mess. I've always found there is never enough seating at these restaurants, at least in Canada."}
{"text":"Every time I came in here it was always around closing time. 10 o'clock. So it was never really busy. But they always greeted me and were very nice. The burger ordering process was very new to me. The first time I visited it confused me a bit seeing as there were only like 6 things in the menu. The cashier was always nice and they actually have free peanuts. Most nights I was tired and didn't want to talk to anyone because I was tired but they were always friendly. The burgers were always grease filled lumps of meat with bread. WHICH IS WHAT A BURGER SHOULD BE! Burgers are not healthy and they embrace this happily. It was the best tasting burger I've ever tasted. The only complaint I have about this place is how expensive it is. There isn't anything the staff can do about it so I'm not judging the price to harshly. But five guys come on. Anyways, I would recommend this as an occasional place. Not really a group restaurant price would be to high. But if your hungry for an actual burger and not that healthy fake burger  sh**. This is the place for you. Just a bit steep"}
{"text":"Burgers are one of the most precious America pastimes. There is nothing like a juicy burger with your favorite toppings and a side of crispy, salty fries. Add in a milkshake and you've just sent half of the chubby guys in America right into full on ecstasy. 

I'll be honest with you folks, when it comes to the burger Five Guys wins the gold in my opinion. Now, before you run over here and burn my house down for such apparent burger blasphemy, let me explain...

I have had a lot of the Cleveland staples including:
The Lola @ B spot
Johnny's Little Bar
The Flipside @ Flipside Burgers
The Gally Boy @ Swensons 
The Better Bonfire @ the Rail

and a few others

I gotta say folks, Five Guys just does it for me. I'm a superfan for a few reasons:

#1 - Customization
I happen to be a BBQ, jalapenos, and lettuce guy. However, not matter what you like on your burgers, you can have it just the way you like - cooked fresh, never frozen.

#2 - Efficiency
They knock it out fast. I've never waited more than 10 minutes at the Five Guys in Kent. All Five Guys, however, seem to run smoothly. You get a great quality burger without the wait of a normal sit-down restaurant. 

#3 - THE FRIES
No burger is complete without the fries and the fact of the matter is that not many restaurants know how to do fries right. Five Guys fries are darn near perfect, and a regular order is enough for two. 

I'm a huge fan, and I love this location. They work hard, are super friendly, and the place is clean as well."}
{"text":"Vegetable sandwich was blah, hard to finish. Burger was well done but not juicy, it was dry. Fries were good."}
{"text":"So yes I did go back within a week and yes it was still as good as it was the previous time.  

I had the small cajun fries and a bacon cheeseburger and soda.  Everything was full of flavor and I was completely full with fries to spare again.  

If you haven't been to Five Guys what are you waiting for?  I have been twice in a week obviously that counts for something =)"}
{"text":"If you like burgers and had one of these yet stop waiting best burger I ever had hands down. 

Way more fries than I can eat. The drink machine is the bomb"}
{"text":"The burgers are cooked to order.  Fries are good too. In my opinion everything is over priced. I only ate here once, I enjoyed it but most likely not paying another visit because of the over whelming prices."}
{"text":"OMG - They have the BEST FISH TACOS!!!! Yum!!!

Just kidding - no tacos here, but great burgers! In all seriousness, I love how all Five Guys are consistent in their food quality... They're known for their fresh cut (and the known origin of) fries. They are actually listed as having some of the most fattening and high calorie fries across america - but, I suspect that's solely because of the massive quantity they give you with a regular/single serving. 

For anyone wondering, they cook them in peanut oil. They also provide free peanuts to eat while you wait. Though, if you have a child with nut allergies, you'll need to steer clear for both of those reasons!

Beep beep beep... What's that?!?! Oh, it's just the dump truck backing up to dump the small order of fries you requested. 

All of the food here is served in a classic paper bag - whether it's for eating in or to go. That's just how they do! So at the bottom of your bag, you'll find your glorious and hearty burgers individually wrapped. Usually, on top of those, you'll find a plethora (yes, I just used the word \"plethora\") of fries. So, they have these decently sized paper cups which they use to scoop up your fries so you get a heaping cup of fries... 

BUT WAIT... THERE'S MORE! They then dump another heaping cup on top of that. Sure, you're left with a lot of fries all over the bag, but who in their right mind would complain about that. Afterall, you cannot really have too much of a good thing when that thing is fries! But note, two or three people can share a single order of fries.

You can order the burgers with really as many smotherings and toppings as you'd like. I prefer meat, cheese, bacon (extra for bacon), lettuce, tomato, pickle and ketchup. They can be a little greasy, but many of the best burgers have a little extra grease to help them go down. 

And if you're a weirdo like my husband - who has a preference for Pepsi products so he can get Mountain Dew - I have to let you know they only have Coke products. But have no fear you yellow drink lovers... They have Mello Yellow. Phew.... Thank goodness!!!!"}
{"text":"As Emmy said in an earlier review, I really wanted to like this place as well, my wife loves them (yep again proving how subjective food can be) I found them to be, well ok, nothing amazing and over priced.

A bacon cheeseburger with mushrooms, the burger patty itself was ok, the mushrooms were fine, the bacon overcooked and something I really hate on something that is supposed to be a good burger, processed American cheese.

Why oh why take a good basic foundation and ruin it with a slice of processed cheese, then charge $6.99 for it ?

Our fries were good, not great but good and I really do think chains such as this and In-N-Out set themselves apart by using freshly cut fries.

So in the end, a semi good meal, not something I would rave about, when it comes down to it, a double double is better in my book and half the price.

So in the end, two burgers, one large order of fries and two sodas, $25, to much money for the product."}
{"text":"Five Guys has one of the best burgers around. I love the cajun fries as well. I went to this location twice this week and it was a great experience both times. The customer service is always spot on. Look forward to eating there again real soon. Thanks!"}
{"text":"More of a 2.5 but A-Ok does sum it up.

I'm embarrassed to admit I have already been to 5G 2X in 2 weeks! I got so excited when I realized this U.S. joint finally crossed the border. 

To be very clear, this is NOT the Five Guy we know down in the States. It's definitely close to the same concept but no cigar.

My burger(s) were good but not great. These guys don't leave the cheese on long enough (it doesn't melt or warm up), some of the ingredients are cold (read tomatoes), the buns weren't toasted the second time I went, and there aren't different cheese choices (can't recall if 5Gs in NY, DC or FL did either).

It's a bit pricey for a 5G burger (come on! don't blame the exchange rate)... but it beats the Burger Bar further up on college (ewww) and the fast(er) food chains (Mickey who?).  

I RECOMMEND: Given there's a GBK not too far on Church & East, and a half-way decent Big Smoke Burger in Eaton centre, don't waste your time on one of these bad boys.  It's a not-so-cheap thrill that will make you wish you'd stopped one door shy at Chipotle's instead.

EXTRA TIP: If you didn't catch the GBK** reference, see my other review (Great Burger Kitchen)"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time before or after work. And after worm im real tired and the best thing to make my day is a person who greets me in an awesome way like Dean and Zach! These guys are awesome really cool and nice guys. Thank you for everything when I come in. Keep up the great work fellas"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Five Guys, but not my standard go-to Five Guys. I would say this Five Guys is usually less busy overall than my standard Five Guys off Cedar, but the food prep is a little longer (although it still comes pretty quick). A small pet peeve I have with this place is the portion of fries they provide with a \"small\" order. Most Five Guys go overboard and give you more than the standard portion of fries. This Five Guys place varies between giving you the standard portion of fries sometimes, and other times they'll give you extra fries. I'm gracious when they give more fries on any occasion, but I just wish I knew how many fries they're going to give before I order. If I knew they were just going to give me the standard small portion of fries, I'd order a medium size to get the extra fries. But that's just me nitpicking, this is a recommendable Five Guys."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Five Guys I have been to. If I was forced to say something negative about this particular restaurant, I would only say that it gets slightly busy at peak hours. But I would still argue that the food is prepared pretty quickly. The employees and managers are super friendly. If you become a regular with a consistent order pattern, they will likely remember you and start prepping your order when they see you walk through the door."}
{"text":"My daughter and I order the same thing every Monday night since January. Last 4 or so times our buns are completely soggy and last Monday the fries were not cooked nearly long enough and inedible. Unfortunately, we will stop giving this business anymore business because this is entirely unacceptable! I work too hard to continue to throw my money in the trash!


Ok so we thought we'd give it another chance (I wasn't buying )and were quoted \"ready in 10\" (@7:48 meaning 7:58 ready) I arrived at 8:03 and didn't leave till 8:22"}
{"text":"Always delicious and fresh! While I love In-n-Out Burgers the most, if I want a burger with all the fixings, this is my go to place. The two burgers don't compare and both have their true attributes. Love the fresh fries as well."}
{"text":"As a fast food burger chain, I was pretty impressed with their service. Staff here are friendly and are willing to help you if you're looking for a suggestion.  Burgers are cooked to order and assembled behind the glass counter. 

What's unique about Five Guys is that they serve roasted peanuts which are incredibly addicting to eat while you're waiting for your order (therefore this place is not for those who have peanut allergies unfortunately). If you order fries, be aware that even their smallest size of fries comes with an extra half scoop of fries (plenty for one person)!

Pretty expensive if you're looking to come here for a full meal. A non-cheesed one patty burger with their smallest sized fries and a drink came to about $16.

I would have given this a five star review if they would change their patties. Unfortunately, having been here several times, I found that the patties that are cooked here and at other locations seemed to be on the dry side and lacked seasoning."}
{"text":"Five Guys Burgers and Fries finally opened up a new location in Scarborough. Now the people in the East end or people that travels only on TTC, can give their burgers a try. 

If you ask me if Five Guys Burgers are all hype? In a way yes.. especially if you are not crazy about pan fried patties. 

I love the open kitchen, you can see all these guys working like a factory assemble lines.. (there were more than 5 guys preparing all the burgers fresh when ordered!) 

Hamburger ($6.49) with grilled onions/mushrooms, jalapeno peppers, Mayo and lettuce 
- Love how you can pick all the toppings and create your own burger..mine is the spicy version usually unless I am sharing it with a friend. jalapeno peppers was really weak tasting... 
- Patties was a little dry since cooked well done and a little bland without any seasonings... some can argue that by doing so, can taste beef in it most primitive form... 

Five Guys' burger is not going to be the burger that I daydreamed about... I love my burger's patties charcoal grilled with seasonings and this thick patties that just cooked medium... pink inside...(not going to find that in Toronto ..so I daydream about it!) 

BTW, your burger might take a little while to get ready.. I guess you can always eat some whole shelled peanuts while you wait!! I hope you are not allergic to nuts!

One big difference between 5 guys chain in US and Toronto, no calories information are posted with the menu... If you see how much calories those little burgers has.. I don't think you would have get your side order of fries with it!!"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's good.

Great food at good value.  Not the cheapest place around, but the best burger for the money you pay.  The fries are excellent.

I would love if they made milkshakes, because I'm sure they'd be awesome, too!"}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch -  my coworkers and I can get there, order, eat, and be back downtown in 45 minutes. 

The vegetarian sandwich is just as good and fatty as the regular cheeseburger, in my opinion.  

More than anything, I just enjoy using the fancy soda machine."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often and every time, everyone is so, so nice and turnaround on food is quick! Best burger fast food chain, imo, even if a bit spendy. The friendliness of the staff at the Monroeville staff in particular makes it well worth the extra cost. Keep up the great work, guys!

Only wish is that the franchise started offering fried eggs for their burgers."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys, it's at the top of the heap in terms of chain fast food restaurants. There's not much on the menu, just burgers and hot dogs, with your choice of (free) toppings. The burgers are griddle-smashed and delicious. My one quibble is I wish the cheese was melted more. The fries are good too, and you get a huge pile when you order a large, enough for a whole family.

The room is great for kids, and you get free peanuts in the shell while you're waiting for your food. A great place to go for a relaxing dinner out with kids."}
{"text":"The food is good, not excellent, but good. I can also appreciate the traditional American road cafe look. What I don't like is the price; I personally find both In N Out and Smash Burger better quality food with better prices. 

Also, I'm not sure if it's normal but a ton of fries were dumped in our bag over the burgers as what I assume to be extra. I appreciate the gesture but thanks for the burns guys."}
{"text":"When I lived in VA, I was minutes away from the original Five Guys location.I can tell you that the Las Vegas outpost tastes exactly as I remember.

The bad news is, I remember Five Guys burgers being overcooked grease bombs and their fries burnt, over-seasoned wastes of good ingredients. And both of those things are still the case and all the free peanuts and Coke Freestyle machines in the world can't save hockey puck patties and fries cooked to orange.

They do serve a delicious and juicy hot dog however, one that doesn't overpower the soft rolls they serve. I recommend the dog topped with bacon, cheese and fresh jalape√±os. But it's like six bucks.

If you like everything well done, this is your spot.

Also, you're dead to me."}

J'ai aim√© la cuisine ouverte. J'ai aim√© grignoter des cacahu√®tes en cosse en attendant mon burger. J'ai moins aim√© les frites sal√©es et mollassonnes.
Un peu plus cher qu'un fastfood classique mais pour moi it's worth it !"}
{"text":"OK. I get it. This strata of \"burger joint\" is highly personal and people have their \"love it\" and \"leave it\" and the debate rages. For me, Five Guys is a \"leave it.\"

The best item is the french fries. Good flavor. Insane quantity. And, most importantly, they stayed hot for the entire time it took me to eat everything else. This is not something all burger places can brag about. I will add, having eaten Five Guys occasionally over the years, that the quality of the fries is dependent upon the person making them and how careful they are to not over-salt them!

The chocolate malt tasted pretty good and is priced competitively. Not what you'd get from a good ice cream parlor, but also priced less.

The burger itself? I had it \"all in.\" The bun fell apart almost instantly so I was scooping up bits off the foil with my fingers. The add-ins were only OK. Not the quality of ingredients from another - been around since the 1940's - burger joint out of CA. 

$15 pre-tax for a \"little\" cheeseburger, \"little fries\" and a shake. That puts this meal price competitive with sit down restaurants. And, the sit down restaurants burger is going to be much bigger. The price for the \"little\" cheese burger at just under $6 is way too high for the quantity and the quality. For this price, it does not add up. Pass."}
{"text":"My buddies were rolling out of town and one of them had never been to a Five Guys before.  Time to sample it, right?  Drove down here and had the last supper (lunch) with my boys before they drove home to Vegas.

I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger which I topped with mustard, grilled onions and regular onions.  I ordered a small regular fry and a glass of water.   Total was a tad over $12.00.  A little steep for a burger and fries but would it be worth it?  Today, I would say yes.

The burger was pretty much perfect today. Two patties of juicy beef,  perfectly melted cheese, plenty of onions and a little mustard tied it all together.   The fries are delicious too.  They are cooked proper and they give you a grip of them!  I couldn't even finish a small order.  Two regular sized adults should probably split a small fry.

Service was extremely friendly.  The cashier who took my order seemed genuinely interested in how my day was going and she was all chipper and smiling the whole time taking my order.  When I picked up my food, the guy who called out my number was extremely pleasant too.  That is always good to see.  Seems like a cool place to work.

Overall, I really like Five Guys.  It's just too expensive though.  $12.00 and change for a burger and fries is up there.  If I would have added a soda, that is a $15.00 lunch right there my friends.  If it was closer to $8.00, even $10.00, I think I would come here more often.  I know a craving will hit sooner or later though,  and I will be back.  Five Guys definitely puts out a mighty fine burgers and fries!"}
{"text":"Way too much food for one person.  The burgers are hot and made to order.  The fries are a meal by themselves.  Go hungry or don't go at all.  A good stop when you're in Charlotte."}

{"text":"My mom lives in Arizona and we went to visit downtown Phoenix. I was apprehensive eating here being a vegetarian and all. In-N-Out is less vegetarian friendly, but I was so happy to find that for me, I liked this place slightly more than In-N-Out. Don't get me wrong, I will always defend my Cali roots, but come-on All The Way Veggie Sandwich with Cheese. It was pricier than In-N-Out, but it's a good sized sandwich. The fries are larger, thicker, a little greasier, but good and they give large portions even for the regular sized fries. Will come back to try Cajun fries and the grilled cheese. I was with my family and it was nice to see there were kids sized items too. Vegetarian friendly and on my list to re-visit."}
{"text":"Food is made to order, so price is good for what you get. They have several options as far as what toppings you can get on your burger. They also sell fries, hot dogs and grill cheese. They have the coke freestyle machine which gives you several drink options. I used the app for the first time and when I arrived the food was not ready. However, in there defense the app stated in progress. I was also acknowledged a few times as soon as I walked in the door. I was also offered a cup of water while I waited. I have visited several locations in my time and the food is always fresh and tasty. Overall great visit and see y'all again soon. Oh, almost forgot, store was also very clean which is always important."}
{"text":"Best Burger Chain in the world. Loved the fries, burger exactly what I expected and free peanuts. Only down side is it's always crowded."}
{"text":"Meaty, beaty, big and bouncy!

Add \"beefy\" and you've pretty much summed up your 5GB&F  experience!

After detoxing this morning, I was really hungry...after all, I'm a pretty big and bouncy boy and when you lug this kind of tonnage up and down the canal, you're going to need some retoxing!

And since it's Taco Tuesday, I thought a burger fest sounded about right!

I needed to be up north anyway, so I texted my order (what a time and vexation saver that is!...two stars for 5GB&F right there) and it was ready, hot and juicy when I rolled in.

The burgers and fries remind me of nothing so much as Wendy's of about 30 years ago...you know, when Wendy's was actually pretty good (not like now when, they consistently screw up your order and figuratively, literally throw your bag-o-food into your car as you idle by the pickup window).

The burgers are OK, the fries are fresh and peanutty (no, really...fresh peanut oil...the fries taste peanutty!), and the Coke is, well, Cokey. 

The atmosphere is nice enough, all red and white checked and tons of \"look at me\" crap on the walls (\"Best Fries in Hoboken!\")

The music was also reasonably pleasant (Men at Work...\"I come from a land down under\"...I shuddered a little bit at the part \"and men chunder\"...please, no chundering while I'm eating!).

Anyway...

I was able to purchase this little repast for a mere $11.83 (I saved a little by having the small fries).

I know, Grind or Delux prices for a retro Wendy's burger!

I'm no spendthrift, but I could feed a family of 6 at In-n-Out for $12...and with better burgers.

But, 5GB&F filled me up, they had my burger ready to roll and they very nicely didn't mess up my order (but then again, how could they screw it up...they were ordered to prepare my burger by a computer...we know what happens when you don't do what a computer tells you...you \"accidentally\" ride over a cliff on your Segway, that's what happens!)

 And, in a nostalgic sort of way, they reminded me of how Wendy's used to be (complete with 70's music), and for that, a reasonable 3.25 stars."}
{"text":"She's gone. Apparently the employees were happy to see her go as well. If I am so hungry and the other 12 places right nearby are closed I might go again to see if they'll scorch my fries."}
{"text":"I have been sick and was really craving a burger and fries.  I have been driving past the new Five Guys on 44th and today seemed like the perfect day to try.

The service was actually really good and the employees were very friendly.  Also, just a side note they have the really cool new Coke machines that allows you to mix flavor into your fountain drink as seen on Food Network.

The problem is the food.  We got 2 burgers, hot dog and fries.  The fries I thought were decent but over salted.  The hot dog was nothing special and the burger was a let down.  I was really expecting a in-n-out style burger and walked away with a smashburger experience.  All Hype no follow thru.  I was also shocked that a place that prides themselves on their burgers and relying on one product they don't ask how you would like it cooked.  Even when ordering a burger at Chile's I am asked how I would like it done

I have to say I was surprised, seeing as they are Zagat rated I was expecting a lot more.  The concept is fresh, clean and I like the peanuts you can munch on while you stand in line and wait for your order.  Just overall I think they need to improve the quality of their seasoning and style."}
{"text":"Great service! food was A1 . It was a really good burger and I love their fries. I also liked all the toppings were free."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Rude, non-pdofessional. How hard is it really to make a burger & fries...
I'll continue to patronize the respectful establishment on the  southwest side of town...
They confirm the demographic stereotype of North Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Their hot dogs are good.  Really not a lot to say.  It is clean and the service is pretty good.  I do not understand people's obsession with this place.  I do not care for the fries and the burgers are ok.  I only come here when I have an occasional hot dog craving."}
{"text":"I've always loved five guys... good consistent food. Greasy salty fresh hot fries... you can't go wrong. I always go for the little cheeseburger and it's a big little burger!"}
{"text":"Famous Fries and burgers What more could you ask for"}
{"text":"Great burgers and amazing fries! I took my grandparents for dinner the other day and we were all very satisfied with our burgers. The amount of fries they give you is astounding (such generous portions). The service was good and the place was clean. It was a great place to take my 80+ year old grandparents as it wasn't too loud and had a nice atmosphere (for technically being a fast food place.)"}
{"text":"I had the LITTLE BURGER with my own slew of toppings and I must say \"IN-N-OUT, you've got some competition!!\"

I really liked the burger! I wasn't sure if it was because I was just really hungry but either way, I was IMPRESSED! 

There was a large bucket of peanuts at the door so you can have a nice munch on a light snack to get your appetite going! 

I really liked how the fries come in CAJUN style! It was really flavorful! YUMMY!

The guy at the counter was really nice and helpful! He broke down the menu for me since it was my first time and was very friendly! 

Five Guys is not too bad...I can see why Obama likes them! :)"}
{"text":"Burgers are better than In-N-Out and awesome, but fries suck.  Great for burgers to take out, but don't bother to eat there with the crappy fries.  There is nothing else on the menu and the kids ate $3 hot dogs.  Husband thinks the burgers are the best in town, so take out it is!"}
{"text":"Solid 2.5 stars.....3 for the online ordering system and 2 for the food. While I usually round up I decided to round down. 

If I had waited in line for this I would have been even more disappointed in the quality of the food. I placed my order in online through a very user friendly process. They sent me an email confirming the pick-up time and I walked on over to pick it up. Past the early hordes of lunch time downtowners. 
The website says they cook your fries once you arrive. Hummm...I doubt that...these things had been sitting around for a while, some soggy, some dry and others slightly burnt. The small serving is HUGE and good luck finding your burger in your greasy bag under all the fries. I finally tore open the bag along its side and dug everything out. Tried to salvage what was good from the fries, I choose a few soggy ones. I finally just got grossed out and tossed the fries. 

Now the burger, wrapped in tin-foil, looked like someone tried to force it from hamburger shape into a round ball before putting it in the bag. When I opened the foil that is what it looked like too. A soggy mess. It was all edible with a fork. I enjoyed the thick sliced pickles and the fresh ingredients, but I thought I ordered bacon...oh wait there it is....paper thin and burnt. 

Over hyped YES. If I ever get a burger craving at work again, I would rather go to the Burger King on 1st St."}
{"text":"Like any other five guys this restaurant boast a terrible parking lot where it is almost impossible to park because of the neighboring chipotle. The service was good and the food came out fast."}
{"text":"They try to be like In-N-Out, even down to the color scheme, but the burgers taste very different.  They offer cajun fries which have some extra seasoning, and if you ask for your fries \"well done\" they don't come out as soggy.  But if you're going with someone else, then one order of fries is all you'll need.  They give everyone huge helpings of fries and I'm never able to finish a single order so I just share it.  The burgers are excellent and the one thing that sets this place a part is the option to get fresh jalapenos on your burger.  Don't forget about breakfast!  This is where In-N-Out fails.  The breakfast burgers are great after a night of partying."}
{"text":"The burgers always come out hot and delicious, plus there are a ton of toppings at no extra cost. One order of fries is enough for 4 people and they have free peanuts! The only downside was it was a little bit warm inside and I can only imagine that in the dead of summer it might actually be down right unpleasant, if they don't start cranking up the AC. Great burger place!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger I've had for under $10.

I think In N Out is one of the most overrated things in life.  I don't get it!  My wife loves it and could eat there twice a week no problem and I've had my fair share of bites.  I just don't see what the hype is about.  No doubt the price is better along with their fries but I'm not coming here for that.

In my world, a great burger always has a ton of toppings and ordering your burger \"all the way\" is the only way to go.  These patties are super juicy and taste fantastic.  I also love the melty, oozy greatness of the cheese is put in between the 2 patties.  

On a side note, the soda fountain machine is tremendous.  It's truly straight out of a Jetsons (automatically dating myself bigtime!) episode.  I've never had that many choices for beverages at a burger joint with quite a few flavors I've never seen like raspberry diet coke.  

Now I have 2 unhealthy vices that I might have to indulge in once a month.  This and Nothing Bundt Cakes!"}
{"text":"What can I say this is like burger version of subway. I like how you can customize your burger from how many patties to veggies or condiments. The fries have a nice flavor not too salty but just enough. 

The first time I was here I thought it was ok not bad, the last time I came it was real good. My mom actually enjoyed as much as she enjoys in n out. It's not overly greasy, the patty doesn't have that frozen taste, and it's not over priced. 

I like that you can snack on some peanuts while you wait. Also the fries come a large amount for example small fries can easily feed 2 people. You can order online and just come and pick them up which is great when you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 hamburgers with fries. $20? It seems the company fraduently names their double hamburger - hamburger. If you want a single burger you order a junior. Not that good. Not coming back and will denounce them every occasion."}
{"text":"Five guys definitely has some decent burgers and fries. I love that you can add a mess load of toppings and the burgers are huge! (if it's your first time, know that the regular burger is 2 patties and the little is 1. Didn't know that my first time!)

I usually get A1 sauce, jalapenos, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, grilled onions and cheese on my burger which tastes exactly how I like. The problem for me is that they always wrap the burger in aluminum foil!! By the time you sit down and open it, the bun is soggy, mishapen, and the whole thing is not as good. -_- I wish they would just wrap it how they do at In-n-out.

The fries are really good. I like them better than the in-n-out ones. Definitely go for the cajun spices. Makes the fries way better!"}
{"text":"My hamburger tasted like fish, I loath fish. :(
Everyone thought I was crazy, but when my husband tasted it I was redeemed. I was given another one and that was was pretty good. They give you a ton of fries."}
{"text":"Yom Yom.  Big fan of the cheese bacon hot dog.  This place is #1 burger/hot dog spot in my eyes!!!  Never dissapoints on deliciousness and customer service."}
{"text":"Great burgers ! You pick out whatever you want on them. Fantastic home cut fries too ! Huge portions."}
{"text":"We usually don't eat at fast food restaurants and I don't classify this as fast food but it's close.  This is close to our house and people have recommended that we should try their burgers.  We were hungry and in the area so we gave Five guys a try.  We sat outside before we got into their restaurant to look at their menu and see how it works.  We figured it out and decided to order their cheeseburger and we shared their large Cajun seasoned fried.

 We sat down and waited almost 10 minutes for our food but that was ok.  Hint not fast food.  We got the order and dissected the cheeseburger.  It didn't look too good when I opened it.  I usually take pictures of my food and I didn't take one because it didn't look that great.  The fries did and they gave us a ton of their fries.  They were spot on and very tasty.  After getting over the look of the cheeseburger and taking a few bites I did start to like it.  It still tastes a little fast foodish but I could tell it was more of a quality burger than a fast food restaurants.  The bun could be thicker to hold the meat in the burger but it still worked.  If I had a choice between a fast food burger or this I would choose this again.   I liked how you can add as many toppings on the burger as you would like and again the fries were really good.  I don't know if or when we would come back to Five Guys but I would recommend them over a fast food burger anytime."}
{"text":"This was A TASTY BURGER!  I like this much better than In N Out.  I got a little cheese & bacon and added lettuce tomato and BBQ sauce, green peppers too.  I shoulda added some onion.  Pretty good!

The fries did not impress.  They aren't steak fries and they aren't skinny lil McD's fries.  They're right in the middle with skins still on them.  They were OK, but nothing exciting.

I'm not sure where the Five Guys name comes from.  I saw 8 people behind the counter.  :-)"}
{"text":"I LOVE FIVE GUYS!  This is my favorite hamburger!  I love all the crazy fixins I can put on the burger - I love mine with green peppers, bacon, cheese & BBQ sauce!  FREE peanuts with ever meal.  YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite fast food burgers - fresh and delicious, plus you customize and add any toppings you want. Also, they have the BEST fries. I put malt vinegar on them, so good. 

This location was not busy, so service was very quick. 

Yum."}
{"text":"Just found a blonde curly hair in my food! I'm disgusted! Just threw the whole thing out! So annoyed!!! Never again!!!! NO STARS"}
{"text":"I have to say that this is one of my favorite places. My only hesitation is that my brother was in Army at basic training in South Carolina and said they are better out there, but still good. So I am holding out a star for a little inconsistency across state lines. The burgers do take a little long, but at least I am not getting a bloody burger, the jalapenos are the freshest I have ever seen and very tasty. The fries are big enough for 2 or 3 people. My girlfriend isn't a burger person and absolutely loves this place and actually recommended we go there one night."}
{"text":"I went back again and honestly, my opinion hasn't changed at all except I like the fries a little more.  But they weren't good enough to bump up the stars.  There's been more than enough reviews to see that people like it, so whatever opening issues do not seem to apply anymore.

So in my opinion, Five guys is just not a good burger.  My husband went with me and echoed my opinion.  His favorite is Steak and Shake at South Point, and I agree the food is far superior and tastier, not to mention, cheaper."}
{"text":"Credit card machine wouldn't work. 
Nobody would help the cashier who didn't know how to handle it. 
Messy as hell. 
Milkshake wasn't ready when they called my number. 
When I asked about the shake the guy turned and yelled \"milkshake\", and nobody did anything about it. 
Five more orders get called and I can see nobody is doing anything about the shake so I ask again. 
A few more orders go by. 
Finally somebody gets to work on the shake.

{"text":"Ordered bacon cheese burger with their free toppings grilled mushroom, lettuce, tomato and ketchup (taste good), regular fries (a bit salty). Also tried their hotdog (taste ok). Free unlimited peanuts."}
{"text":"I always say if u want a good burger, go to a place that specializes in burgers.  Five guys was an excellent choice.  I ordered a cheese burger with most of the fixins, and it was delicious!  Very juicy, well prepared.   I also had an order of fries which actually taste like potatoes!  who'd have thought?!? definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"Best staff I have ever encountered. The people working here make it worth a visit. And of course the burgers and fries are abundant, juicy, fresh, and on point in every way possible. Well done and I will be back to treat my taste buds and warm my heart with all of your beautiful smiles. I love you guys and thank you for being so wonderful while you are working. I always adore eating while I am surrounded by love and joy and kind people."}
{"text":"Service is good. Staff were very nice. The wait was not long. But the prices are completely insane. No combos whatsoever. Every item you have to order separately.. 6.40 for a cheeseburger. I thought it would be a really huge cheeseburger for the price. It's not. Fries were good but also overpriced. Just blown away by dropping $20 for my son and I to have two cheeseburgers, 2 reg sodas and share a fry. Culvers is way better and half the price."}
{"text":"Pros.  First ... I need to mention the customer service.  This group that is working tonight on 1/3/15 ... Is the most friendliest team with all amazing attitudes.  Started with the guy who took my order super friendly and informative about the menu.  Even the lady who was cooking had a smile on her face while making our food.  The lady who was cleaning the tables asked if we were ok and if we needed anything and offered to take my trash ... it felt like I was at a nice sit down restaurant and I told my boyfriend wow they're all so nice here and they were joking with each other.   I'm a firm believer that if you got good teamwork and enjoy your peers it makes work so much easier !!! 

Ok let's get to the food.  Their regular burger is two patties of meat and you can choose a hamburger, cheeseburger, or bacon cheeseburger.  Then you custom your burger with your choice of toppings.  The bacon is super crispy which I love.  Also huge portions of fries.  Boyfriend and I usually just share the regular fries ... which is more than plenty.  The guy also said their regular fries normally feed 2-3 people. Also there are unlimited amounts of free peanuts for you to enjoy.  

Cons.  I think it's a little pricey ... maybe if they had combos it would appear a little cheaper then ordering everything separate.  I have to admit the only thing I like from here is the fries .. my preference for a burger joint is In-N-Out (sorry Five Guys) ... however my boyfriend craves this so we go here from time to time.

Overall I gave it 4 stars because 1.  the service was awesome and I would go here again because of the service but 2.  the food isn't bad at all, it's not my preference but I have tons of friends that love FIVE GUYS !!!"}
{"text":"C and I were in the neighborhood and thought we'd stop in for dinner. We've been to Five Guy's before but not this location. There are some immediate pluses. They have free peanuts. They have the Coke Freestyle machine. (The most awesome creation since sliced bread. Which by the way was invented by Otto Rohwedder in the early 1900's.) But I digress,

This location is in a strip center that is mostly \"food\" places. Burritos, Sandwiches, Chinese Food, Yogurt, Soups etc... Plus, all Five Guy's feel the same so there's nothing really new here. If you're interested in the interior, just check out the photo's.

When C and I got there, the place was pretty busy. The open tables were clean so we didn't have any trouble finding a place to sit. As mentioned in other reviews, you get a number. LISTEN for it to be called. The music can be a bit distracting although C had no trouble hearing our number when it was called.

C got his usual at ANY burger place; Little Cheeseburger ($4.49) with extra extra extra extra pickles. I guess the 4 X Extra didn't mean much. There were 9 pickles all together. So I guess there are 5 pickles normally and they toss in one more for every extra. No Bueno. For the price, there should have been half a jar of pickles under the bun. The patty was seasoned nicely, cooked right and tasted fine according to C.

I ordered the Cheeseburger ($6.19). Like C's, my patty was seasoned nice, cooked correctly and the flavor was good. The stuff I added on also tasted fine. But for the money, why bother. The \"other\" place to the east on the other side of the freeway can give me the same thing for less. Yes, granted Five Guys has a few things that they don't, like grilled mushrooms and a couple sauces. But if you don't get grilled mushrooms or any of the sauces, then what are you paying for? 

C and I also got a Regular Fries ($3.29). These are some tasty fries but again, pricey considering what's down the street. We also each had a regular drink ($1.99 ea). Gotta love the Freestyle machine. While it is my favorite thing around, it's not worth the $5 or $6 extra dollars to come here just for that. 

The staff that we interacted with was fine. The food was fine. The prices are HIGH. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"The generous portion of fries always seemed so endless with half the bag full of fries no matter what size, although the most recent little size cup of fries was definitely tiny. Additionally, the little bacon burger that I got with the endless free toppings can be customized just the way you like it. 

Other than that, the quality of the food is okay, I always wished that the grilled mushrooms were cooked a bit more but other than that, the burger usually taste okay, comparable to other fast food joints. There's also the box of free peanuts on top of the trash cans, which doesn't seem like the best place to put it but I imagine it's to save space."}
{"text":"Price is way too much, cost is around under 2$ for them 15$ to charge people is ridiculous"}
{"text":"Burgers are super tasty. But this place is always understaffed. I'm here at dinner time and there are only two visible employees the whole time I'm here. Wish I didn't have to wait in line so long. And lord help you if there is a phone order or four students ahead of you that ordered milkshakes, too. Food wait times could only be helped with one additional person. The staff is friendly and efficient. It's not their fault. anagement? Step up."}
{"text":"Burgers and Cajun fries are good....but the service here is fantastic!!!! I was impressed by every person that I saw working here. Genuinely awesome!"}
{"text":"FREE TOPPINGS! Yeah - they had me at free toppings, and I am not just talking about ketsup and mayo, I'm talking grilled onions and grilled mushrooms - for FREE! 

Things you need to know before you go

1) It is PACKED! They are brand new so they are busy. Even though they are busy they have enough people to turn everyone around quickly. They even have people on the floor quickly cleaning tables for the next guest. Love it.

2)They have free peanuts! So, if you just cannot wait for your meal, you can graze on peanuts. Its like being at the circus.

3) A regular burger is a double burger...a DOUBLE PATTY burger. Seriously. Wow! So, if you want a single patty you have to get a baby burger. JUST FYI.

4) The fries are yummy.

5) The ambiance is very 50's dinner-ish.  A great family environment.

Oh yeah, and FREE TOPPINGS! 

I had the regular cheese burger with tomatoes, ketsup, mayo, pickels, grilled onions and grilled mushrooms. Wow! It is like the burger you would grill at home - tasty, juicey, yummy.

Lucky for the \"5 guys\" I am already engaged or I would be chasing after them. Great burger place!"}
{"text":"So I had to see what all the hype was about.....The front of the house merchandising is interesting for sure.  So I went with a classic cheeseburger, fries and a coke.  Can't get more American than that!  the burger was really good  I added grilled onions, mushrooms and jalapenos.  The fries were greasy I was disappointed.  Maybe the frilolator grease needs to be changed more frequently? I couldn't put my finger on it.  I'm not the type that would pick at my fries I ended up throwing them out....Sad I know!  As for the staff they were friendly and effcient.  Dining room was clean and inviting.  The ketchup dispenser was out of ketchup!! UGH!  But like I said the burger was really good.  I will give another try..maybe."}
{"text":"Too high priced for all the hype.

Soggy fries? No thanks.
Lots of condiments? I like to taste my overpriced $7 \"100% fresh beef\". Not a bunch of peppers, pickles and mustard.
Fast food? Hardly.
Free Peanuts? Really? I'm pretty sure I paid for them at those prices. In fact, I think they still owe me a pound or two of 'em.

My wallet thanked me for saying, \"I wont be back\"."}
{"text":"Place was clean, but the staff was meh.  Not friendly but not really welcoming.  The guy who took my order, got it correct.  Sadly, the kitchen staff did not.  My bacon burger was missing mushrooms (it was on the receipt) and bacon...BACON (You know, for the Bacon Burger).  So they redo the burger (after waiting a long time for the original order).  They give me everything I ordered plus an added item.  They gave me cheese.  I don't like cheese on my burgers which is why I ordered a bacon burger not cheeseburger.  I can understand when one topping is missing but two, and then add an item that I did no want?  Move along, nothing good can come of going here."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  My wife and I had lunch here, and each of us had a bacon cheeseburger, hers was the single patty and mine was the double patty.  Mine in particular was a real mess.

First of all, even though they are made on site and we ate at the location, the patties were just barely warm when they were served.  Also, there is so much stuff on them, they can barely be contained by the hamburger bun.  Besides which, the bun falls away in pieces moments after you start trying to eat it.  All in all, a big sloppy mess.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Overpriced, bland burgers that are soggy with who knows what and don't taste anything. The fries? I can see through the paper bag, just like when Homer gets fat.

McDonald's make better burgers, and that's kind of hard to beat."}
{"text":"Why in the hell are burger chains starting to cost as much as a sit-down restaurant. This is starting to be ridiculous. The burger and fries were good. What more can I say? For two of us to have two small burgers, fries, and soda, it was $25. I never complain about the cost of good food, but heck...I can have better burgers and fries for $10 or less. I am not going to support these chains that overcharge. No more Five Guys for me...You suck..."}
{"text":"I visited this Five Guys on 5/12/15. Still like these guys, just can't have fries from them any longer. Wayyyyyyyyyy toooooooo oily.  I asked the cashier to please have the person cooking the fries to drain them really well for me. She said oh yes we shake them. (like once!), then toss into the bin for seasoning. I asked for a second bag to keep the oil from getting on the seat of my car. Also did not finish them for fear of rushing an artery clogging situation. Peanut are still good. Can't remember if I saw signage informing us where the potatoes were from. Thanks but no Thanks on the fries."}
{"text":"Five Guys, c'est vraiment, vraiment, vraiment bon. 
Leurs burgers sont excellents et copieux, tu peux y ajouter pleins de choses : Champignons, oignons, cornichons, etc.. Ils font leurs burgers devant toi et c'est assez rapide vu le monde. Les employ√©s tirent un peu la tronche mais j'avoue que se faire regarder toute la journ√©e faire des burgers bacons c'est pas le must c'est sur.
Les frites... OMG trop bonnes, la boisson en libre-service c'est assez cool aussi. 
Allez √† Five Guys, c'est plus cher que McDonald's mais je vous assure c'est bien meilleur et tu sors avec la sensation d'avoir manger et bien manger. 
Bon demain, passage oblig√© avec ma gang !!"}
{"text":"I love me a good burger and 5 guys doesn't disappoint.  The burgers are ok for the price but the fries are a MUST order.  A regular order can feed 2-3 people because they don't skimp.  As a whole I would give this place 3 stars but they earned a 4th start for their online ordering system.  No waiting in line for this gal!"}
{"text":"I guess its good food if you're one of those people who like big burgers, but not me. I find it over rated.  My girlfriend recommended it.  The fries are yummy. Very fresh.  But I wouldn't go there for the fries.  They have bags of peanuts that you can put into little paper bowls and munch on while you wait so thats kinda cute.  The decor is like a 50's diner.  So if you like big juicy burgers than yeah, go here.  Me personally, its a no."}
{"text":"It's a chain, so the food is pretty standard for a five guys.  I live in this area, and I go to a lot of places in this plaza. This is the only place I've ever gotten good service. Every time I walk in, the workers are friendly and seemingly genuine. It's so rare in this area, which is sad, but this place really sticks out as a positive."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a new place come to the neighborhood, went in on a Saturday afternoon & ordered a cheeseburger & small fries & a bacon cheeseburger for husband. The food was greasy and slippery the patties fell out of soggy buns the fries were soggy in some parts and still raw in other sections :( for two cheeseburgers & 1 small fry it was $20 . Which if food was good not biggie but you can go have in & out for much better quality and about half the price for combos."}
{"text":"Ahhh, thinking about those little bacon cheeseburger makes my mouth water! I seriously love to go to Five Guys ( even though I only saw 3 guys and 1 girl).  they are usually nice, cool, and make pretty awesome hotdogs and burgers. However I got one problem, they open at 11am, and I usually crave for burger in the morning since its more efficient of me to buy it early then go I work, other than that problemo, they make awesome foods!"}
{"text":"So I walk in and... whoa. Owww. My ears!

Way, way too loud. So much so that even the yelling of order numbers is hard to hear. When standing at the counter. Wearing a hearing aid. Right next to the guy yelling.

As a friend once said in a review - the volume button is usually a big frackin' knob labeled as such... turn it counter-clockwise... please?

---

OK, I am here to eat. Summary? It's fast and it's food. Get where I am going with this?

I paid almost $9 for a bacon and cheese hot dog (no bun) and a small order of cajun fries. To drink, I opted for a cup for water (free). On the plus side, the fries are sized to feed 2-3 people, easily. And, for the dog, you can throw on all kinds of toppings for free. So, I do see some value in there.

The hot dog was tasty if slightly overcooked. I opted for the barbeque sauce, jalapenos, onions, a little mustard and a little relish. Whether you agree with my no-one-is-kissing-me-tonight combo or not, I have to give credit where it's due: the toppings were fresh, tasted good, and the vegetable ones were nowhere near canned or otherwise boxed - at least I couldn't tell if they were.

My issue is the presentation (common issue for a protein-style person like me). Every order is packaged to go, whether you ask for it or not. In this case, it was a hot dog sprinkled with some cheese, toss on a couple slices of crispy (also slightly overdone) bacon, the jalapenos and onions I added, and wrap it in aluminum foil. The sauces and relish (i.e. the wet ingredients) were provided in little plastic cups so as not to create a mess. Great idea there. However... no paper boat, no lettuce wrap option, no way to pick it up. I had to get some of the plastic cutlery and cut it into pieces.

Um... again I point out that it was wrapped in tin foil. A hard breeze can rip that stuff... It's no match for a dressed hot dog that needs to be chopped up by a serrated plastic knife.

Knife - 1 
Tin foil - 0 

Cue the napkins.

Hot dog #fail.

Moving on. I don't eat fries, but a friend who knows my affinity for spice and bold flavors said I had to try the cajun fries. I had three or four and actually found them to be really tasty, well cooked, and just the right amount of spicy. There was one or two pieces that seemed to be a bit much, but overall they were great. Bonus points, very well done.

The packaging was disappointing, the place was too loud to hear yourself think, there should be a trash bin near the drink station.

It's not bad, but it's not worth the hype. It's a solid A-OK, 3 star, burger stand. It's decent food fast (paraphrasing someone's motto, I know, but it's applicable)... and that's about it.

Bonus \"yay\" for the free peanuts? *shrug*"}
{"text":"Burger was awesome but waited for fries so it wasn't as hot - as a former restaurant manager timing is everything.  Fries were great but one had a really rotten section in it - should have been caught before being cut - quality assurance is so critical.  The staff were nice.  The restaurant was clean.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"A lot of options and the drinks are so fun! Everything is good. The people here are so fun. This place has great food and I recommend it to you!"}
{"text":"Loved this place back in California. It's pretty much the same here but a couple things I noticed that made me dock stars:


1.  THEY DON'T USE FRESH MUSHROOMS. I always get grilled mushrooms on my burgers and these were soggy and had a sour aftertaste like canned mushrooms. I had to pick them out :(
2. Lots of kids working here= poor service quality
3. Fries didn't have the cajun seasoning...or maybe they just didn't put enough of it? They were somehow lacking. 
4. They had the cool coke machines with the gazillion different flavors but I just got a coke and they needed to refill the syrup, the coke wasn't sweet at all :( I guess that goes more with the service complaint. 

Not a big fan of this location but I will definitely try out others."}
{"text":"I had been here once before and it was so so.  My wife and I went for lunch on a sat afternoon.  We both ordered cheeseburgers one order of fries and one drink.  The tab $25.00.    The burgers were huge.  They were so big it was difficult to bite into them.  Also everything kept falling out.  After a few bites half of the ingredients were off the burger.  Eventually I just ate the meat and threw everything else away.  A nice large bun like Fuddruckers might solve the problem.    The fries were very good.  Now the cleanliness.....i get why some places offer peanuts so people can throw the shells on the floor and it won't look \"dirty.\"  However when food and napkins are intermixed with peanut shells it is still dirty.  PLUS there was an employee wiping off the tables and chairs and all he did was wipe everything the floor.  I don't think we'll be going back ever."}
{"text":"Breanne was AWESOME! My wife and I really appreciate authentic and caring staff when we go out to eat. Breanne did an excellent job of a warming welcome and a very professional and positive experience eating here today. This was our second time dining in at a Five Guys, and it might just very well be Breanne's courteous and professional approach that draws us back each time we are in Chandler. Way to go, Breanne. EXCELENT job today. 100% A+++!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, a bit pricey but still love to come here once in a while.  Kinda wish it was called something else though.  I don't like when my wife asks me if I want 5 guys tonight."}
{"text":"Being that I work across the street I felt like I had to come check it out, even though I've had bad experiences at other 5 guy locations. I actually was entertained by the energy the people working had. They were all dancing around to music while making food and looked like they we're having a good time. I decided to order the veggie sandwich , since I broke and that's the cheapest/healthier choice on the menu. It was really good!!!! Like a boss cheese sandwich it came with saut√©ed onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce and American cheese. 
The only reason I give this place 4/5 was because their tomatoes weren't ripe. 
Definitely coming back for that sandwich though, even with a jimmy johns next door. Lol"}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and didn't know where to go as tourists. Luckily our FivE Guys Staff was eager to answer our questions and gave us some great places to go before we headed back to San Diego. We followed their recommendations and had a great weekend. Thanks guys.

Negative: The peanuts were stale."}
{"text":"First time eating at Five Guys. The burgers were great and fries were good too. Would return for sure."}
{"text":"These guys do a great job! Everyone is friendly and helpful. I order online often and I had to call in to change an order, the manager Juan was polite and helpful. I would recommend this five guys over any other burger joint! Good job Juan and the team!"}
{"text":"Food is fine. Burgers are consistent. The employees dont care much for cleanliness. I told them that the cooler on the counter was leaking all over the floor and they did nothing. Then, I went to get catchup for my fries and the dispenser was so clogged up that it literally spit all over me on my white shirt and down my jeans onto my foot. Come on, clean this place a little!"}
{"text":"Okay - yes the burger was good.  Here is the rest of the review.

This is a fast food joint with restaurant prices!  It was $24 for 2 burgers, 2 fries and a 2 drinks.  I don't like fast food joints that do not offer a combo deal.  You know we are coming in there for a burger and fries so make it easy on us!

Also, I ordered a cheese burger and I got a double cheese burger.  Why are we forced into a double burger?  One regular patty would have been just fine.  

As for all the toppings - I guess some people like that... but I am a hamburger purist; all those toppings just make a mess of the hamburger.

Then the fries - $2.89 for fries.  You do get a very large portion, probably enough for 3 people!  I do not care for the fries.  I like some crunch to my fries.  These were very soft russet potato fries.  I would say they may even be fresh cut, but still not impressed.  I guess some people like them soft and limp.  I had the cajun fries - nothing special just some soft greasy fries with some cajun seasoning... 

If I do not like the fries - I ain't going there.  

In most of my reviews (BTW - this is #100) I factor in VALUE.  5 Guys sells a hamburger, fries and a coke for $12!!!!  The hamburger was good but... I am not going back.

Sorry - 5 guys."}
{"text":"A heart attack waiting to happen.  Great service, but for my first time, I didn't know what to expect.  The food portions are huge and the burgers drip with grease.  Only come here if you want a burger and fries and not the healthy type.  Great tasting, but my bun was soaked by the time I got it unwrapped.

You order your food, find a seat and then wait.  They may bring it out, you may have to get it.... It all depends on how busy they are.  Not kid friendly.  I felt more like cattle being fed than a customer.  Not sure if I'll ever go back.

Parking was OK, but this too, is located near KSU so expect a college crowd."}
{"text":"Food tastes GREAT service is awesome BUT the prices are a bit expensive overall good restaurant just be prepared to spend some $$"}
{"text":"peanuts are  good, burgers are great and fries are okay...i am happy to get a burger to go and have it with a bake potato at home...tastes homemade..."}
{"text":"The reason for my 4 star review and not 5 is for a couple reasons. The food is a little overpriced and the guy who calls your number in never friendly.

First, the price. For what it is I just feel it's a little overpriced. It should be under 8 dollars for the burger, fries and drink. Not a big turn off but it's noticeable.

Secondly, the cashiers are always nice but with the fry guy, come on dude! Be a little more friendly.

All in all food is good."}
{"text":"I love five guys burgers, this is my favorite one so far. Staff are super cool and funny, and the place are super clean."}
{"text":"Pros - all you can eat peanuts, large portions

Cons - bad for people who are allergic to peanuts because the shells are everywhere, most expensive burger meal I've had in awhile at $12 (cheeseburger, cajun fries, and soft drink), slower than other burger joints, no drive through

The portion was big...I ended up throwing away most of my fries.  I prefer Fatburger over Five Guys."}
{"text":"First Five Guys I've ever been to and was pleasantly surprised.  They give you a lot of french fries and they are really good.  The burgers were also very very good!  I would definitely go there again.  The service was very friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"Slowest five guys I have ever been to. We ordered on a Sunday afternoon around 2... to go. There were not that many people in the restaurant. We were 4th in line and that process took long as well. 

All told, it took almost 20 minutes to get our food after ordering. Ridiculous. And no one apologized. 

Will never return."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent customer service. Always make it right even when you are wrong and without saying so."}
{"text":"Service was awful, 3 people working, no clients but 3 of us, 20 minutes just to get 1 doble cheese burger and small fries, they were more worried to count their tips jar money than take care clients"}
{"text":"Okay I heard the fries were the best, but for me they fell short of delivery, taste and price wise($2.99 fo a regular). The cajon fries tasted like chili powder and cummin nothing like cajon stick to the plain fries.Don't waste your time ordering the normal double pattie burger ($5.99) go for the single and save the money. Yes it's a big burger, but but not worth the price, the bun can't hold up and falls apart long before your finished. The plus to this place is the multiple choice toppings for the burger with no added cost (it's already built into the price).  The bag everthing is a turn off made me feel like thanks for your money now go away. I spent $11.31 for my meal with small drink (yes I got the double pattie burger  I know better now) that is a good sit down price at any restaurant where you are waited on but not a fast food place. Will I visit again that's a maybe (I did like the toppings) however In-N-Out still has them beat in my mind."}
{"text":"Damn, usually LOVE Five Guys.  Got my cheeseburger to go.  Got back to work and noticed that the bottom bun had obviously been dropped on the floor.  It had several pieces of hair and fuzz all over it!  Flip'n NASTY!  I still give this location 1 star because the Cajun frys are second to none.  It'll be awhile before I visit this location again."}
{"text":"Coming from the west coast and hearing people tell me In and Outs burgers are the best ever can stop crying mow because five guys has raised the bar making me never want to eat i'm and out ever again.."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying 5Guys with my boyfriend and I loooveeeedd it. 
Staff was polite & welcoming,
burgers and fries were the BOMB & lobby was spotless. Couldn't ask for anything better. Thanks Five Guys! Oh and..
Happy National Hamburger Day!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cook to order, amazing burger, Five Guys is the spot.
I have been to a few other locations, but was very impressed with my stop today.
Service was on point and the restaurant was very clean with several tables inside and out.

I ordered a Cheeseburger with Mayo, Lettuce and Pickles and a \"Little\" Fry.
I didn't realize the Cheeseburger was a double burger but no worries.  However, will probably go with the \"Little\" next time.
With that said, one of the juiciest cooked burgers I have had in a long time. They put just the right amount of toppings...still dreaming about it!
The fries are also so fresh, cut and fried to order so you will never get a bad batch.  Just add some salt to the bag and you are set!

And, don't forget to grab some peanuts while you wait!"}
{"text":"So, wasn't sure about Five Guys, but my work colleagues told me it was the best burger so we headed there today and arrived @ 12:30. The line wasn't too long and the guy at the counter was extremely friendly! I chose the single cheeseburger & fries where the others chose the double burgers. The peanuts, served on the side, were awesome! A nice little snack while you wait. The wait was not long and our numbers were called. So, my burger was cook perfectly, however, I wish the cheese was melted a little more & the bun was toasted. I did love the chopped onions and fresh lettuce. However, my favorite thing, the fries. OMG... They are cooked perfectly w/ a great amount of salt. They also have seasoning, vinegar, & barbecue sauce for those who like something more. Overall, service and wait time was great, burger was good, fries were awesome!"}
{"text":"Looooove it! Everything tastes so fresh and delicious! Fries were amazing; thick russet cut perfectly seasoned. Ordered the little burger which is a standard size size since the regular burger is huge! Absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers! It tastes so good, even their fries are pretty good. Definitely would come back here whenever I'm in the area and want a burger! Only downside would be that this restaurant is always packed, so you'll have to wait to make your order, also finding a seat might be hard."}
{"text":"Une fois par semaine, mon chum et moi, on se donne une journ√©e pour manger tout ce qu'il nous pla√Æt. Donc m√™me apr√®s un bon brunch, mon chum a d√©cid√© qu'il √©tait temps pour un hamburger juteux pour le lunch. Je ne pensais pas rien prendre au d√©part, mais quand j'ai vu que le menu disait \"Petit Hamburger\" je me suis dit, pourquoi pas?

Petit? Est-ce vraiment le mot appropri√© pour d√©crire les burgers de Five Guys? Oh non! Mon petit burger √©tait de tr√®s bonne taille, et assez grand pour que j'aie de la mis√®re √† bien le tenir et en prendre une bouch√©e solide. Je l'ai pris tout garni et j'ai √©t√© surprise de la qualit√© des ingr√©dients qui d√©goulinaient tout le long de mes bras en essayant de terminer mon \"petit\" burger. Rendu √† moiti√© chemin, j'ai enlev√© le pain pour manger la viande et j'ai remarqu√© que les boulettes ressemblent bien √† celles que je fais √† la maison, et non pas √† des pucks de hockey dures et gel√©es que l'on retrouve dans une grande majorit√© des fast-foods. Un hamburger auquel je r√™verai s√ªrement les journ√©es de lendemain de veille!

La seule chose que j'aime moins est le fait que leurs frittes sont pr√©par√©es dans l'huile d'arachides. Bien que √ßa leur donne un go√ªt super bon, puisque j'ai d√©j√† eu des allergies aux arachides et que je sais comment c'est difficile de trouver des restos o√π l'on peut manger en s√©curit√©, je trouve √ßa dommage que le commerce ne puisse pas vraiment accueillir les gens qui ont des allergies aux noix et arachides. Ayant dit √ßa, les frites √©taient quand m√™me croquantes et d√©licieuses."}
{"text":"My first ever Five Guys experience was at this location. The staff was quick, friendly and efficient. They had customer service down to a science. the food was great and the drink stations never lacked in anything.

 The only problem was with the seating...it was hard to move your chair and not accidentally bump into somebody else. But I think it was because I visited this place on a weekend."}
{"text":"Not bad. The burgers are good and the fries are decent. The cashier was fast and friendly. But many of the tables had bits of food debris on them and several of the soft drinks seemed to be out."}
{"text":"Pretty good hamburger! Finally trying out their burger and Cajun fries! It's hot fresh and delicious! Why haven't i come here years ago? The staffs are cheerful tonight and was very helpful. They actually going around cleaning the tables and also asking customers if every is ok. Nice services. I'll definitely will come back even craving for a hot juicy burger. Or cajin fries... Love the crispy fresh hot thick cut fries!"}
{"text":"I have been to Five Guys far too many times for my waistline not to notice.....

While a tad pricier than your average burger joint (McDonalds/Burger King/Harveys/Wendys/etc)..to compare this place to them is comical. They're not in the same league as FGBF. The staff actually seem to like working here (as opposed to some of the robots/people who shouldn't work with the public (the kind you find at other burger places)) and they are great ambassadors for the chain. To hear their banter in the kitchen is great.

Immediately upon entering you're at the counter where you order. The cashier will offer suggestions for newbies and I have yet to see one get rude/show impatience for someone who hasn't been here before. Do not be afraid ! 

The regular burger consists of two meat patties and is very filling. I always order the single pattie with cheese (not processed cheese...actual cheddar cheese!!). I also order the small fries, as the large could feed a small nation.

The pop station is all you can drink and while you're waiting for you food order to be made (yes, it's made fresh and not on a factory line like other burger joints), partake in their free peanuts (they're in large boxes near where you pick your food up and FGBF provide small cardboard \"baskets\" to use). WARNING - Do not fill up on the peanuts as the meal you have coming is big. REAL BIG.

The burgers here are on line with some of the best I've had elsewhere (there used to be a place downtown called the BurgerMeister who had burgers to die for) and this is just a bit lower than theirs. They are moist, hand made and flavourful. The jalapeno peppers are HOT and although the next day you'll be asking \"Why did I have them again?\", they are great !

The fries are the best..better than Southstreet Burger (who serve NY Fries). They are thick cut and remind me of the fries one gets at a good fish and chip place. The Cajun fries are nicely seasoned, so there are options rather than having regular fries. Never had the Hot Dog as the place is called Five Guys Burgers and Fries..... 

On our last visit we brought a relative visiting from out of town. We asked the cashier if she thought that a large fry would be enough to feed 3 hungry guys. She laughed and guaranteed they would. She then told the kitchen who filled our bag with fries. She was right, we couldn't eat them all......that small gesture, combined with the great burgers, keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is busy but they get u in out. Love their shakes and food is always fresh. U can have your fries special order with no attitude from cashier or cook."}
{"text":"Five Guys is the place to go they got the best burgers pretty good fries really cool pop machine that has like 500 flavors of soft drinks never had a bad burger from this place and the people that work there a are awesome"}
{"text":"A burger with whatever-the-hell-you-want on it for no extra charges for things like jalapeno, grilled onions or peppers,etc sounds like a smokin deal.  $5 for that burger alone, with no combo deals in sight, brings you back down to earth.

The beef is high quality, with no grissly bits, and the toppings choices are many with plentiful, almost too much, volume.  Makes for a deliciously sloppy affair to eat a burger that is just as tall as it is wide!

I was worried when I unwrapped my tinfoil and saw that the bun had been pretty much smashed down during assembly.  I looked around and it was standard operating procedure, so I dug in, and the bun held up surprisingly well for being so pushed to its limits of moisture absorbtion and weight support.

Salt peanuts! Salt peanuts!  free for the taking.  They are everywhere -- something to be aware of if you have one of those allergic kids that they shut down school for when a classmate opens a PBJ sandwich too close.
I also worried about their storage technique for the sacks of potatoes.  Either they are wasting hundreds of pounds of spuds, or they plan on using these after storing them out where any kid could poke their grubby little fingers into holes in the sacks, or stab the potatoes with a pen, or punch and bruise them, etc.

Prices are high, but I dig Five Guys B&F.  You seem to get what you pay for, except for the drink -- $2.19 for a 32 oz is just gouging."}
{"text":"If you want a fresh personalized burger, this is the place to go. The burgers are not frozen & are put on the grill right when you order. There's a ton of different toppings that you can add. The fries are always fresh!! They are so yummy & give you crazy large portions of fries. Overall love this place"}
{"text":"If we're in the mood for burgers, this is our go to spot. We've never been disappointed and always impressed. The fresh sliced raw jalapeno is a nice option. The fries are perfect. So far 5-Guys & Smashburger are the best burgers we've had in Phoenix. We're always searching for something better, but so far, nothing has beaten the Five Guys experience."}
{"text":"These burgers are good.  It's all very fresh and tasty.  However, it is a bit pricey and I'm not sure it's worth what you're paying for it.  Whattaburger or Wendy's might be cheaper and just as good."}
{"text":"Had a small bacon cheeseburger and fries today with my friend, Nancy. I had never been to a five guys restaurant before. I was pleasantly surprised. The potatoes for the fries are fresh and they post where the potatoes came from that day. The meat is fresh. Excellent service and friendly staff. I loved the fries and the burger and I am not normally a fries and burger person."}
{"text":"Food:  
I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. I ordered a cheeseburger with everything (\"all the way\"). This $7.69 double burger was good, but nothing to write home about. All of those toppings are great, but I was hoping that the quality of the meat would be something spectacular, but it didn't taste much different than any other far less expensive burger. They don't use what I consider to be real cheese. This is Wisconsin, people!  There is no excuse for fake cheese here.  It reminded me of Kraft Singles. My children each had what they call a Little Burger which is a single patty. For $5.69 each, I should have just ordered one regular cheese burger (which again, is a double patty) and split it in half.  I'm really interested in why they price it this way. The fries were good but nothing special. The ketchup they serve is cold-yuck.  Their fountain drink selection is a newer model with endless drink choices. They have two of these machines so there is virtually never any waiting.

ATMOSPHERE:
When you walk through the double doors, you are blasted with super loud music. Whoa. While in the restaurant, the music is almost as loud but tolerable. At least it was a good mix of classic rock and more current music.  The restaurant is kept very cold. I couldn't find a thermostat to report specifics, but it was uncomfortably cold like the ketchup. The restroom seemed clean and the water from the sink is fixed at a cozy warm temperature, though it was way too hot for my kids' more sensitive hands.  The staff is very patient, friendly and happy to be there. I witnessed lots of staff smiles and a verbal reassurance to one customer whose order was taking an extra few minutes. I always enjoy seeing this type of positive energy.

OVERALL:
Personally, I may or may not stop here again. A previous reviewer was concerned with the higher prices on the menu, but apparently he is in the minority because this place was hoppin'-with very few open tables and a line 8 people deep.  If you are willing to pay a bit more for a quality burger, I highly recommend one at the Tornado Room. It's $9 for a half pound burger and it is tremendous."}
{"text":"Visiting from the east, I was excitied to get my marathon over with so my cuz n I could introduce each other to our respective burger joints.  Thankfully, I proclaim I AM NO TRADER. And the winner, yo 5 guys.  In n out burger was cliche, cheaper, less clean, crowed, crappy fries. I declare 5 guys burger joint is the best."}
{"text":"Really good food but a bit on the pricey side. The large fries will be enough to feed 3-4 people, and the regular size will feed 1-2. I got a bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious. Everyone working there seemed nice and attentive. They just need a drive-thru and they'd rock."}
{"text":"My husband ordered a double cheeseburger and cajun fries and I stuck with my usual Chiptole and brought it in the restaurant to join him. First off I don't eat beef and pork so don't give me dirty looks because I'm not eating your hamburgers. I did however have some of the fries can we say salty together. My husband said that the burger was ok, but I felt like I was at an auction with all the ingredients everywhere. Yes they were busy but is it neccesary for 15 staff in the kitchen and yelling so loud because of the loud music. No thanks."}
{"text":"fast food like ambiance, great yummy fresh burgers and hotdogs and they got milkshake where you can add bacon. one hella good place. Service is fast. And their large fries are literally fry in a cup plus extra fry in the bag."}
{"text":"Made to order burgers, pure beef with no fillers.  I understand some other reviewers about the toppings seeming light but it does have to match the patty/bun.  THOSE could be a little wider although there's about 15 toppings that can be added?  I like it that it's custom-made and the quality is better than In/Out or McD.  Improvements: besides the width, I'd say the bun and fries quality.  The combo should be the Hot Dog shop fries (at $5? Ugh) and these burgers.  You want gourmet burger go to BRGR; you want a good old fashioned custom burger, come here.  Free peanuts too!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town, and where I live I don't have access to a 5 guys.  Already I'm a huge fan and was really looking forward to a solid 5 guys bacon cheese burger!

Right away, as soon as you walk in, I was greeted by multiple staff simultaneously, which always brings a smile to my face.  Everybody was up beat and very friendly!  The girl at the counter misheard my order and I received a Burger with grilled onions vs grilled mushrooms.

When I returned with my burger, the guy behind the counter looked so upset, but in a good way.  The way that made me think he takes pride in every burger he puts together, and that one was done incorrectly upset him!  They immediately got busy on a replacement burger and did a wicked job on it.  

5 star for the up beat friendly attitude, quick customer service and all around kick ass burger!

Thanks to the staff at the Monroeville, PA 5 Guys!  BZ!"}
{"text":"Damned fine burger here.  Loosely packed, juicy patties, soft, spongey bun to soak up stray juices and hold all of the goodies together.  I got it with the works which was fine, but next time i'll just go with the lettuce tomato onion.  The works includes sauteed mushrooms and onions and half a dozen other fixings, but they don't overdue it with the toppings so it gets just sloppy enough to handle. 

Fries were good.  Not crispy, big steak fries.

It's a different animal than in n out.  Burgers are bigger, meatier, sloppier.  I'm not a big fan of in n out's limp, blonde fries.  5 guys fries, while not special, beat in n out.  The burgers are apples and oranges to me.  I like apples.  I also like oranges."}
{"text":"Awesome! Five guys....Mmmmmm! That's all I got to say...love the fries..talk about canon style."}
{"text":"If you're going to charge nine dollars for a cheeseburger, you should at least offer real cheese, like cheddar or Swiss. American cheese has no flavor. Everything about this burger is high-quality except for the cheese."}
{"text":"Not once, but twice, I have walked out of this location. Is it policy at Five Guys to squash a burger with the spatula as it is being grilled? Worse, is it policy to cut the edge to see if it's done? Anyone who knows how to cook a burger knows you don't do this and yet I've watched it happen on two consecutive visits. Mentioned it to the \"manager\" the first time and got what amounted to an admission it shouldn't happen. Who wants a dry burger? Have not been back."}
{"text":"First time eating here, but I hear a lot about it. I ordered the big cheese burger, which came with two patties instead of 2, added some good toppings, and instead of regular, I got the Cajun fries. The burger was delicious, I finished it before I got back to the house, the fries could've stayed at the restaurant. They were not really good. The burger, two thumbs up, the place was clean and the staff was friendly, and for that, it earned this place 4 stars. The fries are the reason for the missing star. The place is called five guys burgers and fries. I just wish the fries were as good if not better, than the burger."}
{"text":"As others have said, I am really surprised there are not more 5 star reviews for this place. We LOVE the burgers, the fries, the peanuts, everything! The service has always been great and we are there at least once a month and usually more. I recommend 5 guys to everyone. Super yummy!"}
{"text":"For a place that's supposed to be all about great burgers, at least this location falls far short of the mark. I ordered a little bacon cheese burger and fries (as an aside, I find it annoying that they only offer one size of fries, not on an economic level - as the cost for the size they offer is reasonable, but on a wasteful level as sometimes I just want some dries and not a pound of fries).
Needless to say, after a reasonable wait, I got my food and upon opening the wrapper, found the bun waterlogged and shriveled as if it had been made some time ago. I'm mot sure how this could be however, as I ordered a specific set of toppings which seemed to be present. Anyhow, with the first bite, the Burger self-destructed and left me with a burger-salad I was forced to eat like an animal. The ingredients, except the horrible bun which caused the whole problem, were good and fresh, and the fries - although too numerous, were great.
I have been to another five guys location in the area and this was not my experience there. This location needs to fix a few things to get it right, and the average three stars I saw on their overview probably gets it about right. Maybe this sort of sloppy preparation works for a $10 lunch for a college kid, but for me it was unacceptable."}
{"text":"I have been waiting years for five guys to come out west. Burgers full of flavor, non processed, hand pressed burgers make my tastebuds crave their tasty goodness endlessly."}
{"text":"This place has good food, but prices are out the roof! They are so expensive. For what a burger and fry costs, you could almost order a steak..."}
{"text":"Your favorite burger joint's favorite burger joint.
Just another great five guys.
Burger is excellent with unlimited free toppings.
Fries are not free but they are amazing.
Also free peanuts.
5/5"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for Five Guys in Las Vegas FOREVER!!  I haven't been as excited as I was when I drove by the \"coming soon\" sign for this place awhile back.  The staff is friendly, especially for a \"fast food\" restaurant.  The burgers are a bit overpriced, but definitely delicious. It's great that you get to decide what toppings you want on your burger, and they are not an additional charge.  I am a fan of the cajun fries, and I am in love with their iced tea machine.  I also love that they have the bulk peanuts for customers to enjoy while they wait for their order.  All of the food is fresh and they tell you where the potatoes are from that they are using for the day.  You don't get that at any other fast food joint."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Fast service. Not enough seating. So what, you get free peanuts? Cajun fries are nothing special. Absolutely no feeling of human/customer service presence. In and out is cheaper and better..."}
{"text":"It is what it is...Burgers and Fries. With that said, this place is legit! Some of the best burgers and fries in the business, all cooked to order and perfection. My favorite? Bacon cheeseburger with mayo, BBQ, tomato and lettuce....let's not forget the cajun fries! I want some cajun fries right now! Yes, it is about $10 for a burger, fries, and a drink, but that will not stop me from frequenting a Five Guys near me int he future. Quality over quantity, this place has solidified their place in the burger market."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries  a little pricier than the norm but worth it. Pretty fast. Free nuts is also a fun snack. Will be back.

Yum Yum."}
{"text":"So I went to five guys today with a friend and he had the double bacon cheeseburger or something like that and I had the little hamburger. Just to be clear their normal hamburgers are very big, and they have to beef patties whereas the little hamburgers are the same but they only have one beef patty. A normal hamburger will cost you anywhere between 690 928 dollars$6.99-$8 and something, I think the small burgers are $5.99 to about $7.50 I believe. The wait was about 10 minutes for us to get our food. We also ordered Cajun fries a regular order which we shared between us. The fries were really good and I would recommend those for sure. They give you enough to overflow the cup and cover the bottom of the bag. The fries weren't greasy, not overly salty, and they were really nicely seasoned with the Cajun spices. The burgers themselves were pretty sloppy, but they were okay. I don't think that they were worth the price that we paid in terms of quality but you do get a pretty big burger so I guess it's not so bad. I wouldn't say it's the best burger I've ever had, but it's definitely edible and I would probably return again. The only thing that I wish they would change is that they should have a large sign outside saying that they have peanut shells all over the floor from the peanuts they serve  with every meal. If you have a peanut allergy, or your kids have a peanut allergy, do not come here!'"}
{"text":"Not bad, but I'm not sure why this chain has a great reputation. It's just OK. Burgers are pretty tasty but grossly overcooked both times I've visited. Fries & drinks are expensive, so a simple burger/small fries/fountain drink is quite pricey. Burger toppings are good and they're all \"free\" - included in the not-exactly-cheap price of the burger, so load up."}
{"text":"We went here because we saw on social media that they had a vegan burger. Well, that wasn't the case. We got the veggie sandwich. The service was ok. Then while we were eating, the sterateck auditor came in. It was disappointing to see the entire staff scramble and start putting on gloves and stuff they should always be doing. Not sure I will return here. Standards should be upheld at all times, not when the inspector shows up."}
{"text":"An \"A\" rating by the health inspector. This is my new favorite burger place. All food is made to order, fresh and hot! The kitchen is open so you can see the food prepped and made. It's not the cheapest, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Why can't there be a Five Guys on the East Side near where I live?  I would be there at   least once or twice a week.  As it is, with this place downtown, it's a bit annoying to get to, but well worth it.  

I like the franchise because they decided to do one thing, do it well, and not get fancy about it.  There's no chicken sandwiches or salads.  You get yourself a friggin' burger and some fries (and they will ply you with fries, my friend--their small is everyone else's large), and you shut up and eat it.  You will enjoy every bite and wonder why you don't go more often."}
{"text":"As  far as burgers go, Five Guys is one of my favorites. They do it right. And if you order a \"little\" fry, they give you more fries that most fast food places give you in a large fry. 

However, I can't eat starch anymore. So, I can't have bread of any sort. Most places, I make do with the lettuce wrap. It's simple enough. Places like Hardee's and In-and-Out and Red Robin have been doing it for years.

Five Guys can't seem to get a handle on it. Their employees need better training in this technique.

The first time I asked for it, the guy at the counter looked at me like I'd asked for him to bark like a seal while showing me his toes. I had to explain what I wanted. He eventually said they couldn't do it (despite their website claiming they could). The second time I asked for it, I got handed my burger, sans bun, on a bed of shredded lettuce in a bowl. Hamburger salad-style. Fine. No big deal. I ate it without complaining.

Today, I went in and asked for a burger in a lettuce wrap and what I got served was a mound of lettuce with my burger somewhere in the middle. It was impossible to pick up, let alone eat, and I ended up having to go fork-and-knife on it.

I admit, lettuce wraps are a pain the bahookie, but given the rise of health conscious people avoiding wheat and starch and sugar, this seems like something on which Five Guys might want to think about training their employees a little better."}
{"text":"Placed my order on line, picked it up and drive home.  Opened the burger and it was not made correctly.  Called the store and spoke to a manager.  I basically had to ask for it to be re-made so I could come pick up the correct burger.  Picked the new burger up without an apology or acknowledgement of the inconvenience. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"The burgers are good but the girl taking our order was a little rude She made me want to leave the way she was towards us. when we asked if we could get the fries well done she said they can't do that and she thinks there just fine. never heard that before never seemed like she really didn't want to be there."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries! Warning there are peanuts! If you're not allergic, definitely check this place out if you're craving a fresh and fast burger. Nice staff, and a clean space."}
{"text":"It's probably a good thing that I don't live closer to a Five Guys....

I am in love with their fries!!  They are delicious!  I order the regular size and even it is too big.  Not only do they fill the cup, but then they also fill the brown bag that the cup of fries is poured into!

This is the first place where I saw the cool soda machine that I've now seen in a few other places.  But I love that you can pick your own drinks from so many different flavors!  Although, I get cherry sprite every time!  Yum!!!

Every time I have been here, there's always been good seating and everything has been clean.

My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it's a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I was a patron of the original Five Guys in Arlington, VA, and I was stoked when I first noticed the location that opened up in Madison. I really missed their burgers - we used to send interns on Five Guys runs when I worked on the Hill.

The menu is super simple (although you wouldn't know it from how long someone took to order the last time I was here), just burgers, dogs, fries, and drinks. If you order a hamburger, you get two patties cooked to order. You can choose all sorts of toppings, from fried or raw onions, to BBQ sauce, to my personal favorite - some A1 sauce. If you get a regular burger (and not a 1 patty burger), you might want to split your fries with a friend, as they give you a big cup overflowing with their fresh cut fries. I go with the cajun fries (cajun seasoning sprinkled on).

The only disappointing thing about these new Five Guys locations is that the buns are not as good as the original. The Arlington location had a bakery next door that baked their buns fresh every day. That said, they are as good as anything else out there in the quick service burger segment.

Oh, and while you wait, you can help yourself to some complimentary peanuts!"}
{"text":"Good as usual. If your new to this place the small burgers means 1 paddy and the regular means 2. Large fire can easily be shared between 2-4 people. Love the grilled onions and all the veggies. Thank you"}
{"text":"I've had Five Guys elsewhere, but maybe this one is different? Nope. It's a great burger that is well assembled and I love how the cheese gets all melty and messy in there with the loaded toppings.

Your order will be prepared extremely quickly while you fill up your soda and then you can get down to the eatin' part. Fries are good, but not great.

Five Guys is a huge step up from the fast food joints, but it's not the best burger around. If you're looking for something just a bit more upscale, try the BT's Burger Joint across Tryon in Rivergate."}
{"text":"We really like Five Guys and we're visiting from out of town so we decided to grab take out from this location. My husband asked for my hamburger to be well done and the cashier even repeated it back to him. But when he got back to the hotel my hamburger was literally RED in the middle. I can't stand pink in my burgers. Extremely disappointed. The fries were pretty good so that's the only reason I gave it two stars."}
{"text":"Great burgers made to order.  You can go with the small size or the bigger versions.  Their version of fries are always a little burnt for my taste but they give you a great big serving.   A great option is a bacon hot dog - you can't go wrong with that one!  The only downside is that ot will cost you a good $20-25 for two meals."}
{"text":"This place is my daughter's favorite place to eat.  The burgers and fresh cut fries are fantastic, but the kicker here is they are very attentive to her food allergy.  Because they don't use the fryer to fry anything w. gluten (chicken strips, onion rings etc), the french fries are gluten free.  Thats a huge win for anyone w. celiacs disease.  The staff changes their gloves when they handle her food, and even has a gluten free bun if she chooses to have it.  She also loves the soda machine, it has a million choices on it.  We will continue to keep this place in mind whenever we are looking for something G Free for her."}
{"text":"We tried this place because we hears Obama likes five guys burgers, this place is horrible, now I know why the economy is the way it is."}
{"text":"Very good burgers, Cajun fries are awesome. I had a great experience here. The only suggestion is they should have milk shakes here. That would be the icing on the cake. I would definitely be back. The staff was nice and the food was fresh, what else could you ask for."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time the other day and I loved it! I loved the ease of ordering. I love the cool soda machine and I love the atmosphere. It feels like a real burger joint to me. 

I will be going here again. I do agree with some of these yelp reviews, it is a little pricey."}
{"text":"It's five guys - what's not to like! Great burgers, fast service and plenty of fries."}
{"text":"Five Guys has taken the winners stand in fast food burgers in our book. Great quality and taste, far surpassing anything that is around. Hats off Five Guys!"}
{"text":"\"Five Guys kicked my arse!\" That's a phrase I like to use immediately after visiting Five Guys. Why? Because they kick my arse and fill my belly with delicious burgers and fries. I always order a \"little\" cheeseburger and devour it like a beast. To me, there's nothing little about that sandwich. And the fries...when I get an order to go, I just pour the bag of fries directly into my mouth."}
{"text":"With all the advertising I was expecting a mind blowing bacon and cheeseburger.  However, what I got was nothing better than I could have made at home.  The fries are pretty good, a kind of rustic cut style, however this is not sufficient for somebody that was searching for an honest to goodness hamburger.  A tip to the restaurant: everybody can make pan fried hamburgers at home, think about getting a grill and a few special ingredients that are not usually found in a household refrigerator."}
{"text":"I really enjoying going to Five Guys knowing I can get my burger wrapped in lettuce and with everything I want on it.

While the it is a bit pricey just a  burger, I find that when I am short on time, and want something to satisfy me Five Guys can do that (Does that sound wrong?)."}
{"text":"I really just dont get the hype about 5 guys. I've eaten at this location once, and the eastern location 2 or 3 times. I think they're actually on the pricier side for a generic burger and I think the fries are borderline terrible. This last trip, they forgot the bacon on my burger so when I asked about it - they asked if I minded putting it on myself and then handed me two cold pieces of bacon wrapped in foil. I took it back up there and indicated the bacon wasn't hot, and her response was its made in the morning. Okay.... so I handed back the bacon and said never mind. I mean who wants cold or room temperature bacon on their burger?? They could at least throw the bacon on a flat top for a minute to warm it back up. Seeing I was dissatisfied, they brought me a refund to my table which I think was fair. The burger fell apart and I think it doesn't taste much better than a big n tasty at McDonald's. I think In N Out or Fatburger produce a much tastier burger, and In N Out is a hell of a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"I always get the same thing and I'm never disappointed.  The burgers are made of tasty and delicious ground beef...not a beef product.  The Cajun Fries are plentiful (my husband and I share a small with leftovers) and very tasty.  The service is always wonderful.  Nothing bad to say about five guys or this location."}
{"text":"Twice the price and half the flavor of In-N-Out!  Just ordinary burgers and a very crammed dining room. The free peanuts are a nice touch."}
{"text":"Amazing fast-food chain. If you are looking for an amazing tasting burger or hotdog, Five Guys is a must. Don't sleep on those hot-dogs, they are out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first bad review I have left for Five Guys.  This time they served us cold fries and screwed up our order and we were customer number 4 and our bill totaled over $40.  They did remake the order, but by the time my burger came out the rest of my party had finished their meal. This a considerable failure on Five Guys' part."}
{"text":"You know, I take my burgers seriously. This is the most standard american diner burger you can get. It even tastes american, but something falls short. The fries are plenty and the fountain pop is.... well... fountainy. 

I really can't say it's worth the 15 dollars to come here. It's a nice treat to take a break from the crappy food around my work and enjoy something that's a little tasty. However I was extremely close to heading next door for California Sandwiches. 

There are better burgers in Toronto."}
{"text":"My first time at Five Guys. I enjoyed the burger it was so much better than other fast food burgers. The fries were amazing and quantity was unexpected. Will probably visit again but if you have a peanut allergy stay away from here."}
{"text":"I went here the other night with my boyfriend for the first time.  I do not eat typically eat burgers, but he was having a craving, so I accompanied him.  I am writing this review not on the food, but more so on the staff.  They were so friendly and went out of their way to accommodate us.  They went above and beyond and made us feel very special.  We have some special food requests and they were so kind!  On a side note, I tried his burger and fries, and they were both pretty amazing.  Thank you to your kind staff!!"}
{"text":"Five Guys is kind of the dive of burger joints.  They have a simple menu of greasy burger and fry like items.  It's a very east coast type place.  Overall though, I give it a low rating because it just shouldn't be in your burger rotation.  Between In n Out, The Habit, Fuddruckers, any local bar and even jack in the box your need for a random hamburger should really be well covered.  There's even the upscale fast food burger now in places like Burger 21, just no real reason for Five Guys since it falls behind all of them in value.

On the positive, nice people in the place, and this location is unusually well kept up and clean.  Hit one in Brooklyn and you'll see what I mean."}
{"text":"Five Guys, In N Out, Smashburger, much like pizza, there are different types of burgers for different occasions. I honestly enjoy them all, but when I want a juicy, filling burger I go straight to Five Guys. I love that all of their toppings are free, but I always get...brace yourself...pickles, mushrooms, and ketchup. It sounds weird, but it is perfect for me (and no I am not pregnant). I also enjoy that their burgers are doubles! It is just the right amount of food. My husband and I always split a regular fry, which is more than enough. They fill a small cup and then cover your burgers in fries, it is awesome! They have East Coast style fries that you can tell are cut from fresh potatoes, they even have a sign stating where the potatoes are from on any particular day. I love that they even have vinegar for your fries for us East Coasters. The free peanuts while you wait, because everything is made to order, are a nice touch as well. The staff is always very friendly and the tables are always clean. I am never disappointed with Five Guys and I can easily see how this became a popular chain all over the country."}
{"text":"We ordered our regular which is two burgers, fries and a drink. It was unusually disappointing because one piece of lettuce was array in the burger but what was worse was that it was already yellow and browning on the sides. I don't know if this is a health hazard but it will definitely change my view on this place."}
{"text":"The first experience I had here was great, my normal experience at the five guys chain. I usually order a veggie sandwich with cheese and a side of Cajun fries. My first time here, the usually enormous sandwich was perfectly gooey with just the right amount of cheese you'd expect in a grilled cheese sandwich. The side of small fries was also massive. Worth the $7-8 bucks. 

I returned a couple of days ago and was not as pleased with my order as before. The veggie was small and lacked the cheesiness I normally get with this sandwich. The jalape√±os were Also cut inedibly thick, had to pick them out. I'm hoping this was an off day, it was pretty crowded. 

I'll be back for one more try, hopefully I will remain a returning customer."}
{"text":"Worst Five Guy's ever!

We walked in yesterday ( Thursday at 9:30) for a quick bite before our movie. Ordered the veggie sandwich and small Cajun fries. The sandwich itself was mediocre, not bad . But what really brought this experience down was the service. I've never seen such uncaring Five Guys cools. Three people including myself asked for more fresh ketchup as the dispenser was empty. The three cooks just said oh there are packets on the side as well. They even removed the dispenser after a fourth person asked! I also noticed my Cajun fries were regular fries so I go up to the counter to ask for the Cajun fries I ordered. Instead of giving me seasoned fries, the cook pulls out a bucket of Cajun seasoning and hands it to me as if to say fuck off and do it yourself. On top of that, the fries were completely undercooked. For the first time in the history of my life..I THREW AWAY FRIES. (I know, it's like the Luke, I am your father reveal) I love my fries but I just couldn't put myself to finish them. 

Bottom line, don't come here!"}
{"text":"Yes it's part of a chain but the quality of the food is still excellent. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is always friendly. It's a good place to stop for lunch."}
{"text":"Best fast food burger! Quality of food is great and clean too. Cajun fries are awesome selection"}
{"text":"Burger quest continues.... 

I had heard a lot of good things about Five Guys. Hearing good things about a fast food joint is always surprising. The final verdict. Perhaps a slight notch up from McD's or Burger King. 

The fries were actually very good. I love crispy fries that haven't been sitting there for hours (or days??) and they were high on the crispy o' meter. Plus the single helping was ginormous! Enough for two people fo' sho'! 

On the burger side, meh. 

I ordered what I thought was a regular cheeseburger. Thankfully the chick at the register told me their \"regular\" is actually a double patty. Um, this truly is an influence of American culture super sizing. Ok, I'm getting off my box now...I opted for the single patty, which was the little hamburger. 

Little - normal portion. Keep that in mind when ordering! 

The burger itself was ok. Definitely not life changing. And believe me, I've had myself a life changing burger in the burgh! Cough, cough....Wingharts...cough, cough. 

So if McDonald's and Five Guys were the last Fast Food restaurants on earth....I would go with Five Guys. Not saying much, right?"}
{"text":"Is this the best hamburger you'll ever have? No, but for being a fast food burger it was pretty good with a lot of little extras many other places don't have. Things like the grilled caramelized onions and double the amount of pickles that I have gotten from any where else. There was also two slices of tomatoes which was nice but they were still a little too ripe and could have used another day or two before reaching preferred quality. The menu said free toppings but for a $7 burger, they didn't feel so free. If you haven't been to a Five Guys, its definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Five Guys. The burgers are so worth the price you pay! Best burgers I've had so far, I can honestly say I prefer them over In n' out and that is saying a lot. Nothing against In n' out, they've got good burgers, but Five Guys has flavorful burgers with an abundance of toppings to choose from."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I simply love five guys. They are a little pricey but you can taste the value in what you eat. The fries are so fresh and with the good salt and ketchup on them they are perfect. You can taste the quality in the meat as well. Each time that I have been there my order has been accurate, fresh and simply delicious. When I am in the mood for a good burger and fries this is definitely my go to place."}
{"text":"Five Guys is definitely one of my favorite burger chains next to Whataburger and shake shack. What I love about five guys is that you can find them across the country, verses just scattered here and there. This five guys location was clean, fast and efficient. Food was 5 guys quality, and my order was correct. What else could a girl ask for?"}
{"text":"First time at this location and don't know if I'm gonna come back either to be honest. Ordered a bacon burger without cheese and ended up with cheese anyway. Asked them to remake it and then they forgot the bacon. I wouldn't have given them two stars had I not paid $15 and tipped them $5 before I got my food."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today.  Excellent burger, and all the extra's on the burger are free which is pretty nice.  It was just over 10 bucks for a cheeseburger, regular fries, and large drink. The food was excellent.  I ding it down to 4 stars though, just because anything this good has to be unhealthy, and its definitely greasy.   The grease from the fries saturated my brown paper take-out bag.  They also squished the top of my bun pretty bad when wrapping it up in tin foil.  I'm guessing if you eat there, you don't have this problem as much.  Still, 4 stars for an excellent burger and fries place.  Definitely a step up over In-N-Out."}
{"text":"All you can eat peanuts. Fries always overflowing in the bag. Vast selection of toppings. New soda machines. What else can I say? Good and fast service. Employees were enthusiastic and motivated."}
{"text":"Great, consistent food and friendly/fast staff. Always enjoyed going to this location and have never had any issues with service or quality of food."}
{"text":"Customer service is outstanding. They have very good food and always fresh fries. The lighting and music make eating here very comfortable."}
{"text":"Their cheeseburgers are pretty tasty, and I just tried a hot dog the other day and it was actually really delicious! Their fries are good, I wish they had a smaller size considering I have to throw half of them away if I'm eating alone. It would also be nice if they didn't make every order to go, it's kind of a waste of paper..."}
{"text":"The burgers are hot, fresh and very tasty. The nice variety of add on ingredients are always fresh. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is outgoing, friendly and happy to accommodate the customer.  Love the peanuts and huge helping of fresh cut fries.  Always has been a positive experience for my family."}
{"text":"* Good burgers! 
* Free unlimited peanuts! Quite messy tho. Needs frequent cleaning and sweeping.
* Good service
* Quiet location
* Ample parking at plaza"}
{"text":"Super slammed today and the manager took good care of us. That's what helps make it a great visit, when customer service is above and beyond it makes a huge deal. 
Also, best burgers around."}
{"text":"Wanted a burger for dinner and wanted to try something new. My first impression wasn't the greatest. They have bags of their french friends and boxes of oil all over the place as a display! Is this their idea of decor or did they just run out of room in the back? The music is SO LOUD you can't even think. I can barely hear the girl as I was trying to give her my order. 

You mean to tell me the $6.99 cheeseburger is ONLY a cheeseburger? No fries or anything with it? Almost $12 for a cheeseburger and fries? NO DRINK. That's crazy!! I didn't realize it was that expensive until I was ordering and I didn't want to embarrass myself and walk away. I figured I'd try it.

I do have to say, the food is very good. Fries were delicious. Burger was good too but really sloppy. 

Would I go again? Probably not. The price is just out of control! $12 for a burger and fries is just insane! Whataburger and In-n-Out has food that's just as delicious, right down the street, and literally HALF the price. 

Good food but nothing to write home about. I just can't get over the price!"}
{"text":"Our favourite place to get a burger! The food always tastes delicious ! Last time we ate here I got the lettuce wrapped little hamburger and it was still really good even without bread."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype...  This place was all over the broadcast and print news when they first started opening in Vegas, so when I wanted a burger, I figured 'What the heck?'.  Well, as 'cool' as the interiors are, and as nice as the employees were, I have to say I was extremely disappointed.  Maybe it's a case of too much hype, since they have quotes from other city reporters and periodicals posted all over the place stating how they're the best burgers ever.  I don't know, it just seemed ordinary to me.  Not bad, but not worth trecking there if it's not on your way to somewhere else.

Everything is served in brown paper bags, which is ok I guess.  Conserve water you'd waste washing trays, but kill more trees with paper bags?  I guess it's a tradeoff.  One cool thing I enjoyed was the boxes of peanuts everywhere, and you nosh on those while you wait for your order.

Like I said, I wouldn't NOT go there, I just wouldn't go out of my way to go there.  I'll stick to IN-N-OUT."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a five guys in a couple years.   I walked in and it was completely empty. As I browsed up at the menu my jaw dropped at the pricing. A burger would've cost me $8-$9?!?!?   I asked if that was a combo and was told it was just the burger itself.  I calculated for my three kids and my wife and I to eat at a fast food burger joint, it would've cost me more than eating at most of my fav't dine-in restaurants.  This experience has completely changed the way I view Five Guys. I don't recall it being this expensive when I last tried it.  Now, I wouldn't even consider this restaurant as an option to stop by.   We just went to Jack in the box next door.  
Five Guys, really reconsider your pricing structure.  You are pricing out way too many ppl."}
{"text":"This is the second visit we've had to this five guys,  the first visit wasn't so bad. I decided to come here with my family of 4. When we received our food, we discovered our order was wrong. There was only a couple and my family in the entire restaurant, so they weren't too busy, but they were joking and having personal conversations about partying, when they should have been paying attention to the orders. For the quality of food and service, I just can't justify paying $56 on mediocre hamburgers and a bunch of french fry pieces dumped in a grocery bag. You can do In N Out for half the price!"}
{"text":"Excellent cajun fries, though if you're eating there just eat the peanuts instead and save some money.  At any rate the burgers are huge and should fill you up on their own.  The newfangled soda machine is a wonder, you can get your soda flavored in a number of ways."}
{"text":"I gotta say the burger was super yummy... fries not so much!"}
{"text":"I think Five Guys is overpriced and overrated. As long as you're in Madison, you can find local places with better burgers.  The burgers at Five Guys still are pretty good, but more expensive than most fast food and not a good as a good local pub in Madison."}
{"text":"awesome burgers and fries... wish i could eat this all day everyday..."}
{"text":"Everyone was right - five guys is good, but really expensive for what it is...fast food. It was little over $20 for 2 bacon cheeseburgers, 2 drinks and 1 large fries. 

I like that you customize your burger and service was pretty fast. I got mine w mushrooms, lettuce and tomato. The fresh mushrooms were a nice surprise and they were generous w the extras. Love the crispy strips of real bacon. Bun was ok, burger was a little dry but ok, I liked the fries. 

It was good, but I'd rather go to red robin or anywhere else for a better quality burger w fries for $10. In and out is similar quality but w better buns and lower prices. And milk shakes!

Oh and they had 80's music blasting way too loud. Not cool 80's more like Genesis/Phil Collins. *barf*"}
{"text":"love the Cajun fries here (a small order is enough for two people, trust me) and that you can put SO MANY toppings on your burger!  it's a little pricier than other fast food joints, but I feel like they use better quality ingredients so I don't mind paying a few more bucks."}
{"text":"This was the best five guys I have ever been to! From the great customer service to the food and cleanliness.  First lets start with the employees. I hate that I didnt catch their names but they were so upbeat. They welcomed every guest that walked in the door and had genuine smiles on their faces! Rare find nowadays. I ordered a cheeseburger and man was it great. It wasnt dripping in grease and tasted so good. You can tell they took their time rather than slapping it together. I would definitly come back here again for great service and burgers made with love."}
{"text":"Compared to other five guys restaurants this one was ok. I've gotten a ton more fries at other five guys restaurants. Good burgers! For the price I rather go to in and out but that's just me. 

Anyway, if you want a burger you can get a pretty good one here! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review
It is a pretty good burger is how I would like to sum up my experience. This is not your mcd or burger king. It is on the pricier side with burgers from 6-7 dollars depending on what you get. The food is cooked fresh off the grill. My major problem is the hamburger bun was served ice-cold. I don't know if this is normally the case but with the heat and cold you can see in my picture that it became soggy from condensation and deformed. Still I would say this is a pretty good burger, not steak house variety, but better than culvers. The fries are fried in peanut oil and were simply delicious. Also they are hand cut and even have a sign showing which farm they came from. All and all if the buns were warm and not from the fridge this would have been a 5 star experience.

Pro: fresh burgers, hand cut fries

Cons: on the more expensive side, cold burger bun

Hidden gem:
Free shelled peanuts when you walk in!"}
{"text":"I finally get it.

I have been to several other Five Guys across the country, in places like New York, Ohio, Texas, and even a couple other locations here in the Valley.  I have always loved their burgers, but have always had a problem with the fries.  I see the awards for the fries on the wall, and even more telling, I see the hand-written index cards on their bulletin boards about how the actual customers at that very location love the fries.  I have always found them lacking - not crispy.  Until now.

This place does them right - crispy every time.  I don't know what they're doing differently than the other locations I have been to, but they need to keep it up.  My favorite Five Guys.  And now they have a smaller sized fry.  Perfect."}
{"text":"Everyone calls this the back east in n out Burger. I thought it was a very good burger a little more than in n out but worth it. Fries are good and they give you A LOT of them in the small order."}
{"text":"Haven't ate there in a while but I love their burgers. Oh my god they are the best. They make it the way you want it and I love them. Please don't ever leave me. Love me feed me never me five guys"}
{"text":"I LOVE Five Guys Burger and Fries! You an choose your toppings to put as little (or as much) variety as you want. It's cooked well done (no pink center) which I appreciate and like. They're sort of like Jack in The Box....they don't make it until you order it. Which is great because it's fresh food. The fries are delicious! The little fries are enough (in my opinion) for 2 people because they give you so much! This is definitely great for your money. They are so friendly and courteous. My order was done correctly. And, there's the wonderful peanuts! Did I mention that I love peanuts? Well, these are also great and another reason why I love going to Five Guys.

Worth noting:
A \"little\" burger is just 1 patty. The other is 2 patties. Something I wish I knew about when going the first time since the burger is quite large. Little hamburger is by no means \"little.\""}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent! Seems strange to me to have to search for a good hamburger yet this is what where reduced to. Went to 5 Guys today (first time) on the way back from a hike in Tonto Ntl Forrest. It was just like back home (Michigan) when I was a kid and good burgers were plentiful! Reasonably priced, very fresh and fast. Johnny Rocket, In N' out ish but better quality meat. Delicious."}
{"text":"Let's just say that I am an IN-N-OUT addict and this was my first time at a Five Guys Burger joint overall. It was a pretty good experience and I really liked the quality of their Burger. 

Atmosphere 3/5: It's a fast food joint so no big surprise. The place a little bit dirty but beside that, it was alright.
Food 4/5: I was pretty shocked by the Burger. It was pretty good actually and I really like that I was able to choose the garnitures on my burger and it was free. The burger is pretty decent size and actually preferred the bun from 5-Guys vs. In-N-Out. The Cajun style fries are really good.
Service N/A: 

Overall, a good experience at Five Guys and Fries. But In-N-Out stays my favorite for their Secret Menu."}
{"text":"I have taken my family to many different Five Guys across the valley, and this one is the best hands down.  I can tell the employees are happy to work there.  The quality of the food is better because the people working there are having a good time."}
{"text":"I was excited to see this new location in Gilbert.  However...I was not impressed at all with my food.  My burger was burnt, like crunchy burnt.  This surprised me, I have never had such a bad burger at a Five Guys.  Their food is really expensive, and I expect a high quality product.  I think maybe that their new crew isn't in their groove yet.  This experience reaffirmed to me that not all Five Guys are equal.  I will continue to go to a farther location that has never done me wrong."}
{"text":"So the last time I came I got a hotdog, iwas not a fan at all. So I'm going this one more shot. Wow you can add bacon to your milkshake!!???
       Ok this is a really good burger. So yeah I'll be eating here way more often."}
{"text":"I've been brought here more and more....

and I'm starting to change my opinion!

This is a great burger spot... get in.. sit down... and get out... (kinda like in-n-out without the wait;])

I love how home-style this burger is, I feel like I went to a family barbecue and got a delicious decent sized burger... with melty cheese and absolutely no skimping out on ingredients here!

I love how the burger falls apart and gets all over my face.... driving me to use 10 napkins per one burger.

Maybe I'm just a sloppy eater, but the juices from the meat, tomato, pickles, and juice/grease from the cheese will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Cajun Fries, you always get way too much and they're delicious.  I also love the fact that you can get A1 if you want, who else does that for burgers?  The staff is always friendly and I've never been in a dirty Five Guys, everything is always spotless!"}
{"text":"First time I tried this place was about three years ago, and it was a great experience, the burgers were delicious, the fries..man can't forget the fries they were great! I love five guys so much that I had to download the app to order from them lol great burger place!"}
{"text":"I was quite lost in this burger and yet again tuned out to my surroundings as these burgers are always just soooo good!"}
{"text":"As always, love this place! My grandma said it's the best burgers she's had in her life.. not sure about that but still love it. I always order the little cheese burger with little fries and omg do they give you so many fries! I always order the little fries and share them"}
{"text":"Man who invented the hamburger was smart; man who invented the cheeseburger was a genius.

Gotta love me a good burger every now and then.  I gotta admit that Five Guys hits the spot!  $5 for a Little Cheeseburger?  Yes please!  Don't let the \"Little\" fool you though.  It's still a hefty burger.  The only difference between a regular Cheeseburger and a Little Cheeseburger is that the regular has two 100% beef patties while the Little has one patty.  I get mine \"All the Way\" which has all the toppings [Mayo, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, and mustard].  Add some cajun style fries on the side and you got yourself a great meal. 

Some other items they serve besides the usual burger/cheeseburger/bacon cheeseburger are hot dogs, sandwiches [veggie, grilled cheese, blt], and Five Guys milk/maltshakes.  All mix-ins are free!  Additional toppings for your hot dogs and burgers are relish, onions, jalape√±os, green peppers, A1 Steak Sauce, BBQ sauce, and hot sauce.  All hot dogs and burgers are also available bunless.  So what are you waiting for?

\"The Willy Wonka of burgercraft?\"  I'll give them that."}
{"text":"Took additional 15 minutes for my pickup order. Great food just online ordering was lame."}
{"text":"When I mention Five Guys to a group of my friends, they just could not stop ranting, raving, O-M-Ging and everything in between. I thought to myself. \"For reals?\" No way. 

Let's get down to business. I got myself a bacon cheeseburger, regular fries, and a drink. $11 bucks. I thought it was pretty pricey, especially when I could drive a little bit and grab myself a double double animal style, fries, and a drink for 6 bucks at IN-n-OUt. 

The order came out in a paper bag and you could see the grease spots all over it. Yum. I opened the paper bag only to find a mountain of fries just piled inside. The burger was what I was most looking forward to. I opened the aluminum wrapper like it was a Christmas present, carefully and slowly, to see the steam of the fresh hand packed, juicy, double bacon cheese burger staring right back at me and begging for mercy as I was about to double fist the burger into my salivating mouth. One bite was all it took. The endorphins were rushing through my brain and all that I uttered under my breath was... O-m-g. 

The fries though, left much to be desired. Hence, the one star deduction. It wasn't all that they were cracked up to be. It was a bit bland and soggy. There is really nothing worse than taking a bite of a juicy burger only to bite into a soggy fry right afterwards. It ruins the experience.  I don't care that much for soggy fries, it was truly a let down. 

Overall, minus 1 for the fries, plus 5 for the burger. Oh and the peanuts you can eat while waiting. Five guys is going to be a success in Vegas. I can't wait to see them grow and go back again for their delectable burger."}
{"text":"Food is usually good but yesterday's food and service was horrible. Just a little disappointed"}
{"text":"Is it just me or have the prices recently gone up? Either way the food year seems good and affordable to me.

If you are going for a combo, the prices can get pretty high. But for 2 people, we just split a regular fry and skip the drinks and it really isn't any different than other fast food places. The fries are good. The burgers actually taste like meat.

My only complaint with the free peanuts is it seems like the turnover on them must be pretty slow. I get quite a few rancid peanuts. But those are only a free snack while waiting for my burger."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying out this restaurant. I was very impressed with how friendly the staff was and how great the atmosphere is. Very relaxed and they had great music playing (albeit a little loud). I got a cheeseburger and fries and was pleasantly surprised. The fries are to die for. The cheeseburger was okay, I've had better. But it was still really delicious. 
It was a little pricy, but you absolutely get what you pay for. I couldn't even finish my burger, it was so big.
All in all, great experience, great food. I'd definitely recommend this place to others and will probably be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered our food,than sat down.We both noticed how very hot place was.This was Sat 2Jun around 430p.I asked a staff member if they could turn down air.She said would check with her manager.A few mins later
A lady came to our table,said air was not working.Had been that way all
day.We could hardly eat our food,they did offer us a bottled water.The staff was very kind,but they really should of got a repair company out to fix 
problem earlier in day.We love 5 guys for a great hamburger,but will
not go back again without checking to see if air is working."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here. I have been here many times and have always had a great tasty burger. Be prepared to wait 5-10 minutes for your burger but I feel it is worth the wait! They give lots and lots of fries even with the small order! Their service is usually friendly but could be a little friendlier at times."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever eaten hands down. It's the perfect greasy, delicious american burger. It's literally my dream burger, and It looks straight from food network. if you want the most delicious burger ever... Go to five guys. I've yet to have a more satisfying burger in Toronto. Just wish there were more of them! The fries are also perfect. Tons of free, quality toppings. The regular burger is 2 patties; the mini is one. I always get th regular one and its freakin bomb. The staff have always been really nice as well. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I had a special day at another location and made a stop @ Scottsdale Fashion Square last Friday late afternoon to meet the Easter Bunny and have a portrait taken ( ;) ) before heading for home and decided to try this establishment since they had a veggie option, and I was curious how the meal would turn out.  Prefacing: unbeknownst to me for the moment, when I tried to used my credit card at a nearby photo booth,  it was down and caused my card company to flag the booth and temporarily shut down my card (until I eventually went online at home to fix it), and when I ordered at Five Guys after the booth incident and tried to use said card, it was denied.  A light bulb went off, and I mentioned to the millennial-type girl whether the downed booth beforehand had something to do with it?  She looked at me uncomfortably and said \"it means you didn't have money\" in a staunch manner (which caused me to be more firm) and I told her I had just used the card right before the booth incident and to run my card again (just to show that no, it doesn't mean I didn't have money), which she did and still denied.  I even hinted at her by quickly showing her the receipt from a previous merchant where I used that card (just to show that it's not me but another system malfunction).  After I got home and fixed the card incident online, I telephoned Five Guys and asked for the manager and got a James who was very apologetic about the booth and girl incidents and said that he had a hint it's not that the card denial was not about lack of funds but that it could be their system and possibly not because of the photo booth situation.  He agreed that the girl should've immediately called him over to the order station before I left (which I had to do to check my card status online ASAP) to find out why my card was denied.  He said the girl was still working her shift as he and I were speaking on the phone and would definitely page her and speak with her about her mannerisms after we'd hanged up.  He also offered me a free meal if I chose to come back, which was very thoughtful of him(!)  I did go back a couple days later as I had other errands to do at the mall, and James did remember me and that girl happened to be working there and saw me as if he did speak with her and had a \"oh! I see\" expression on her face.  Priceless ;)  (BTW, I have alot more money than she's had.  She will never succeed in life if she were to stay locked in that 'tude of hers, right?)  Anyway, I ordered the veggie burger with regular fries and a chocolate shake.  It took about 10 minutes, and I like that it meant the meal would be hot & fresh.  The meal was a decent lunch portion and tasted very good, and the shake was cold and not frozen- just thick-soft enough for me to enjoying drinking out of a straw.  The veggie burger (which means a \"hamburger\" without the meat) and fries weren't greasy or soggy and served nice & hot.  I dined in and enjoyed my meal out on their patio- the weather's just too nice to eat inside with all the hyped noise.  Only thing I'd suggest is to have trays rather than having diners awkwardly carrying their bagged meal and beverage and little cups of condiments all at the same time towards their tables.  Thanks for the great customer service, James :)"}
{"text":"I know it's a chain and I try not to review chains, but damn are these burgers and fries good.  However, I'd heard other compare them to in n out on the left coast and I'd disagree because while they are quite good they do not compare to the first time I fell in love (in n out burger).  Okay, went here with Mom yesterday for lunch.  I was a bit surprised to find it relatively empty and no wait at all.   The cashier greeted us with a warm, genuine smile and even gave mom a compliment on her blouse.  She knew how to work the tip jar.  I ordered the \"little\" bacon cheeseburger and it was plenty big and really reasonable priced.  I had it with sauteed onions and mushrooms (no extra charge) and a bit of mayo.  Mom was more traditional with a \"little\" burger with L, T, O and ketchup and mustard.  We ordered one drink to share and a \"regular\" cajun fries.  The total cost was under $13 and we had plenty of fries left over.  The burger itself was really flavorful, juicy, and the bun was soft and warm.  The fries were some of the best I've ever had in any restaurant.  I think it's because they are fresh cut daily and double fried in peanut oil.  The restaurant only serves burgers and fries, so not to much to think about.  I don't really care that they don't serve milkshakes I think I did enough artery clogging with the bacon cheeseburger and fries.  Tessaros is still the best hands down, but if you are looking for a great quick burger and friendly service for Mickey D's prices.  This is the place to go.  I will become a regular."}
{"text":"Hmmm a burger joint with fresh ingredients, made to order, and free peanuts, Sign me up!

After a hard day of outlet mall shopping, mom and I were getting a case of the hungers. She hasn't been to a five guys before so it was time to introduce her to deliciousness. 

When you walk in you see where the potato's are from, like which farm. When you walk up to the counter it is laid out pretty easy. You have your choice of hamburger or double meat hamburger and a whole list of toppings. Cheese, bacon, bbq sauce, mustard, jalapeno's, its made however you want it.

Now the frie's are my favorite part. While im not a fan of the cajun fry's, i do love the regular fry's. Even better is that a regular order will feed 2 people. They just toss your burgers in a bag and shove it full of fry's. 

The coke machine was mom's favorite part, It is a touchscreen that allows you to choose from about 50 some off soda combinations. Cherry coke, Lime Dr Pepper, just image having that as a kid the flavors of our suicides would of been!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and fresh fries. This is not McD's so the burgers are really good made the way you want it. The best part free peanuts! All you can eat!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and even better service. You could tell the cashier was new and was a tad lost and the gentleman on the grill came over to assist with no problems. Always so friendly it honestly makes you smile with how friendly they are. I wish I knew the gentleman's name so the owner could give him recognition. Every company needs someone like him. He deserves a raise. Definitely our favorite location we've been to."}
{"text":"Cheap awesome burgers and fries!!!! We also had a veggie sandwich and grilled cheese everything was great, $23 for a family of 4"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I had a hot dog, and not a burger - which they are apparently known for - but Five Guys left me flat. The Kosher Style Hot Dog that I had was \"just a hot dog\", ordinary, overly salty (grilling it didn't help that), and a far cry from the Vienna Beef that I love. That's all I had, and I won't do it again. To be fair, I should probably go back and have a Burger since that is what they are known for. I wouldn't bother with a hot dog here if you are really into hot dogs..."}
{"text":"Don't call you order in because they don't put it on til u get there... duh? Called my order in so I could pay n run but.... walk in n no customers nothing on the grill...just cashier ... ask why isn't my order on the grill? She said I don't know?? At that time 3 people walked out from the back laughing n talking... I ask who's the  Mgr? The one that came from the back said I am ... I ask for her name Sileana? Ask her why my order is not on the grill n she said must be late printing out? N then  She said ,can't hear you?! As she told coworkers that I was mad. I called corporate number n they still have not called me back ?!! I see now why there were NO CUSTOMERS"}
{"text":"LOVE FIVE GUYS!!! This place is always so busy when we go. But the wait is worth it. The service is always so friendly. I have always been greeted with a pleasant hello when we go there. The burgers are delicious and the food is served hot...the bathrooms could get cleaned a bit better...overall, awesome!"}
{"text":"Bad a$$!!! One of the best burgers I've choked down in a long time!! It is a little pricier than your regular Gag in the Bag type place, but well worth it! Also like the free peanuts while waiting!"}
{"text":"You have to have rocks in your melon to spend $13 on a basic burger, small frys and small drink for what would cost $5.75 at In n Out.
Go ahead, throw your money away.

The employees are well rehearsed with answers when people complain of the prices.
Try them out,, and if you fall for the high prices,, you'll fall for the lame answers.
Ask them was that reply number one,,, or was it reply number 8?

NYC extreme fast food prices just don't travel well IMHO.
In n Outs business is booming for good reasons."}
{"text":"Pretty good didn't get peanuts while I was waiting, but there was hardly any wait time. This is my favorite burger joint out all of them and you see the food being made in front of you. The Cajun fries are awesome and the burger melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"I was introduced to five guys burgers during one of my many trips up to Chandler Blvd. The burgers come in two sizes, a double and a single. All of the toppings are free and the options are plentiful. The soda machines are the new touch screen type with lots of different flavors. The burgers are always juicy and delicious although I could stand for them to be a little bigger. The real reason why I will continue to return are the fries. OMG these are probably the best fries I've had since I had Thrasher's Fries on the boardwalk of Ocean City MD. If you put ketchup on these fries you are missing the point entirely. Vinegar is provided on the condiment table and takes the fries to the next level. As a word of advice, the small order of fries is more than enough for two people. Save your money and share a small order. 

This brings me to the only real negative...the prices. I am aware that if you want a quality burger you will pay for it, but when my wife and I get a burger each, a small fry to share and two drinks and it comes to 20 dollars, something is wrong. I'm never full when I leave and it seems like I should be after spending 20 bucks for lunch. 

Definitely worth checking out though if you're a burger/fries fan."}
{"text":"This place makes great burgers, I look forward to trying many different kinds. I also ordered the Cajun fries which is just some Cajun seasoning, I wasn't impressed with fries as they were soggy. But the Hamburger was very delicious cooked just right."}
{"text":"Best fries I've ever had, bar none. The little cheeseburger is an excellent size for a lunch burger."}
{"text":"Amazing place. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger burger, double patty. Can't go wrong with bacon! Haha All the staff is friendly and greets you."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick shake and quite frankly I was a bit unsettled by the menu choices. BACON, IN A MILKSHAKE? To what madness has mankind descended? What makes the matter all the worse is that I found myself tempted to try it. Much like a moth drawn to flame, I feel the pull towards my own destruction. Only the thinnest strands maintain my tether to reality, as the siren repeats its haunting call. While I have been able to leave the physical boundaries of this Five Guys, I fear that this ethereal idea will remain inside my mind until the grave offers its sweet embrace. 

Overall, good Oreo milkshake though!"}
{"text":"Five Guys Burgers finally opened in Old Montreal! Considering that I waited a good 20-30 minutes, I guess the word is out! Since I spent almost 4 years in California, aka \"In-N-Out Country\", I was impatient to see how Five Guys would compare to my beloved fast food chain. In the end, I must say that there are no clear winners.

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger all-dressed, which includes, grilled mushrooms and onions amongst other things. Quite a large selection of free toppings. As advertised, the beef patties were very fresh: handmade, juicy and very flavorful. My friend and I scarfed down our burger without saying a word. Word of advice: The burger is quite messy because of its size. I felt the bun was not toasted enough and the cheese was not melted enough but I am just being fussy here. 

The fries are fantastic. Made in-house from real potatoes, the definite winner is the Cajun style fries: the spices add a nice kick. The portions are huge. You can easily share a regular portion between 2 persons.

The only drawback is the price. A burger, fries and drink will cost nearly 15$! Maybe it's a good thing... it'll prevent me from going there too often on my lunch breaks! One would say that you have to pay for quality.

Five Guys people: Please add poutine to your menu! Dudes, you're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Rounding out my recent burger forays, I paid a return lunch visit to this Five Guys, this time forgetting that a Regular Cheeseburger here is equal to a double burger most everywhere else.  But I nevertheless enjoyed a very tasty humongous Regular Cheeseburger with 2 hamburger patties well done but juicy as advertised; and 2 slices of not that well melted American Cheese, along with fresh lettuce, tomato slices, pickles, onions, mushrooms, Green Peppers, mustard, and ketchup added.  This was washed down nicely with a Vanilla Diet Coke from two \"Coke Everything\" machines, a few complimentary roasted peanuts, and great Hand -cut Skin-on Fries overflowing their container, except that they were over salted.

Restaurant staff was extremely friendly, greeting me on my arrival, departure, and even after just emerging from the restroom.  Since there are free soft drink refills, diners might as well just order a regular drink rather than a large.  Grease spots had deteriorated the integrity of the paper bag holding the Fries but a replacement was gladly provided for me to take over half of the original batch home to Diane.  She was appreciative--and I will be back.

4-1/2 stars overall in evaluating this particular visit!"}
{"text":"My favourite fast-food burger option in town. You pick the toppings, the meat is fresh, and the cheese is wonderfully gooey. I'm not a fry guy - but theirs is fine. Free peanuts too. Don't expect variety beyond this though. To re-emphasize: the burger is king here."}
{"text":"They use peanut oil for cooking all of their food. Peanut makes me literally sick, cannot eat there. Please be aware of what places cook with what oils etc"}
{"text":"Normally I'm a huge fan of Five Guys and took a couple buddies to show them that there burgers were comparable to In-n-Out, with better French fries! We just left a phenomenal convention and let's just say this location was an extreme letdown.

This review has nothing to do with the employees, the three stars is all them; They were excellent! This is about the horrible buns they were given and old lettuce. I don't know if the buns were old or just disgusting but they ruined the burger. I'm just lucky i didn't make any bets with my friends before we got there or I would have been screwed! The buns also left a terrible aftertaste that killed the flavor of the fries I usually love. 

I'll keep going to my home Five Guys but I would not come back here!"}
{"text":"Thanks Chris the food was amazing and the place is always looking nice inside much appreciated"}
{"text":"Usually grab a burger here a few times s month. Always great tasting. Bit overpriced but the portions are pretty goods guess it evens out. Service is usually great and friendly but for my visit today I have to take two stars off. Came in late afternoon no one in line At all. Usually in this place you can barely get in the door without the whole staff  yelling out to you and welcoming you. I was never greeted at all even when I got up to the counter. Just a blank stare from the cashier no hello anything. I'm the one that had to greet her to which I got \"what can I get you\" . Not the biggest deal but was for sure a little off service wise today."}
{"text":"Pros: Very clean inside. Burger was good. Staff was friendly. 
Cons: Extremely overpriced. Fries were so salty they were veritably inedible. 

I'm sticking with Culver's."}
{"text":"Five guys is the type of establishment that has the feel of a fast food restaurant since the food comes out to quick but the quality and the customer service close to a fine dining experience ! The food is amazing, I always go for Cajun fries, the flavor is not too salty and you can definitely tell the fry the fries perfectly and not too oily. The burgers are cooked to the way you want and always comes out mouth watering. The service usually lasts 2-4 minutes talking to the cashier so it's hard to make an impression on a customer, but Garrett was awesome. Very informative and also you can tell he cares about his job. Usually cashiers or fast food establishments don't really care but he was very nice and even let me know I have the option to put Cajun seasoning on the side which seemed like he didn't mind putting in a little extra work for a random customer. Joel was also cool too. You don't expect fast food workers to ask how your day was or if you need anything else because most of them seem like they don't care but everyone here was awesome !"}
{"text":"Hands down the best hamburger chain in the world. No cheese fries at this location hence 4.5 stars. If they served alcohol it would garner 5 stars.  Ordering isn't an issue for me as a veteran but the family ahead of me was so slow that it killed my mood. Free peanuts is always nice but if you are a novice and load up on them your meal will become a to go box. Burgers are always awesome with tomatoes mushrooms ketchup bbq sauce mayo lettuce steak sauce mustard and large cajun fries on the side which are refilled if you can handle like me."}
{"text":"Hamburgers are great but the fries are not good. Place is very expensive and your paying for it. If they only sold Go-Gurts I would be there every day."}
{"text":"As far as chain fast food burger joints are concerned in Las Vegas, I think Five Guys is hands down the winner.  I have tried In and Out, Smash Burger, and Five Guys and they all have their strengths but if we are simply talking quality meat and quality burger...Five Guys all the way.  

The menu is short and straight forward and you can add as many toppings as you like, no additional cost.  I realize this place is more costly than In and Out but its in a different class and at least they HAVE bacon here. Bacon is a must."}
{"text":"REBEL TV picked up a burger at Five Guys! I couldn't finish it! I couldn't believe it. I can finish anything. This was a colossal burger of joy. I got leftovers! Can't wait to try the Frys. Be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences I've had in a five guys. My burger came to me in two pieces and the place was filthy. Almost all the tables were dirty and the floor was nasty. Disappointed."}
{"text":"i'd never heard of this place and we thought we'd give it a try.  i accidentally ordered a bacon buger (2 patties) with relish because i thought it came with all the default toppings, but it only came with relish.  when i took it back, the staff was nice but the owner/manager was visibly dickish about it.  the new burger i got ended up being a single patty and they said i could keep the old one.  so of course i combined and now had a triple decker.  and i pounded that bad boy.  it was awesome.  the cajun fries are also outstanding- very big fries.  i only wish this place had shakes."}
{"text":"Raddest Five Guys yet. Charmella just MADE our experience."}
{"text":"Just like every five guys I have been to this place is great! I got the bacon cheeseburger with small fries and my meal was $14.51."}
{"text":"After friends from mainland have been telling me this is better than In-N-Out , I got an opportunity to try during my layover in Phoenix.  I do like better than In-N-Out now.  Cajun fries are good also."}
{"text":"I have had my faith renewed in Five Guys burgers after visiting this particular one, as they nailed my order as if I made it myself.

Fast and friendly a definite winner."}
{"text":"So glad there is a location now in my area. I have loved 5 Guys since I was first introduced to them on the East Coast.  4 starts because they are pricey for burger and fries but will be returning"}
{"text":"Burger and fries were good .....but the second I walked in, my jaw dropped at the crazy-high prices on the menu board of a seemingly \"fast food\" joint. Panicking, I furiously looked for a combo meal deal...but apparently those don't exist here - everything is a la carte.

My total came to $11.37 with tax for a (double) cheeseburger and small fries; no drink included there other than a cup for water (which I hope I wasn't charged for).  I believe a fountain soda would have been an additional $2.49(!?)

The ambiance here is nothing I would pay extra for, and the food, while pretty good, wasn't really much better than Culvers (which is half price compared to this place, and definitely better atmosphere).  

I'm giving Five Guys a 2 star review just based on poor value. Sorry, (Five) Guys.

Overall, this place has gotta fix their pricing if I'm gonna be coming back with any frequency. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, I was almost instantly turned off by the way-too-loud music in the airlock. I'm sure some people have turned around and walked right out after hearing that noise."}
{"text":"I have rarely been to 5 guys, tried it a couple of times before when I first saw it in Massachusetts and I wasn't impressed. Some may like the brown bag approach but to me it was lazy just throwing my food in a bag that way even when eating in. 
I only ordered a burger this time, no fries. There is no indication that the regular burger is 2 patties. I thought the difference between regular and little was size, but maybe it is patties since I got two. I can't eat two. Should be a notice there that it is 2 patties for the regular burger. 
Other than the burger was pretty good (even though I paid for a patty I didn't eat) and the shake was really good, not too thick, just thick enough to still be able to drink it.
Would I go there again, I suppose I would, it was tasty. Just wish the signs were clearer as to what you got when ordering."}
{"text":"Burgers and fries that's all it takes to make me happy. I have to say that Five Guys fries are hands down the best, cleanest tasting fries you can get. Unlimited toppings are a big plus too. They never get my medium burger cooked right but its still delish. 

So grab a burger and eat the fries while they are hot, don't forget to top off your bag with peanuts."}
{"text":"greasy and overrated. the bun was REALLY soggy. i HATE when my hands get greasy from bottom bun fat. MEH."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype about this place. The cheeseburger I got was a hot mess. Standard is a double patty so if you want a single get the \"Little\" version. What bugged me was the meat was about as flavorless as what you'd get at a McDonalds, the burger was saturated with mayo, and it looked like it was thrown together before the bun was smashed on and wrapped in foil. Disgusting to look at and eat. I've had much better at Burger King.

Only reason it got 2 stars was their fries, both regular and cajun, were great. Save yourself and get a way better burger at Smashburger or In-N-Out."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a hamburger person so I ordered a cheese dog with mushroom and A1 sauce and though I was a little skeptic of my own simple combination, the ingredients were really good individually and together! I ordered a \"little\" size of fries and they gave me more than the cup size (I had like 3/4 extra fries in my bag that couldn't fit into the cup but I'm not complaining!). And the free peanuts and refillable drinks are nice so it kinda makes up for the high price a bit (just a bit...)

Plus, I was a bit worried about previous reviews' negative comments about customer service and cleanliness but the cashier was really prompt and kind and cleaned our table as soon as he could! :) Might have been the late hour because not a lot of people were present but those negative points have been dispelled in my mind."}
{"text":"My wifeCame back hysterically mad guess you gotta babysit these high school kids that are working there there's one a chubby little girl talking and talking and laughing while our food was getting cold all the guys around her laughing and chit chatting like girls.. there was one other customer in a restaurant,,,,wow where is the manager!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"probably my favorite burger place, reminds me of long island."}
{"text":"really good burgers and fries. fresh made to order get the Cajun fries. only drawback is youll be paying about 25$ for 2 people."}
{"text":"I'm annoyed that I even have to give you guys one star just to post. Learn how to take orders correctly, and cook food properly."}
{"text":"I had always loved In n Out, in fact, when I lived in Reno years ago, before they had In n Out, my friends and I would drive 2 hours to Sacramento on a Friday night JUST to get In n Out... 

But, since moving to Phoenix, I have to say that Five Guys is really awesome. They take a little time to get your order ready, BECAUSE THEY COOK IT FRESH WHEN YOU ORDER IT. In n Out also takes pretty much that long... I don't know what kind of grill you work on that defies the laws of physics, but it takes a certain amount of time to properly cook meat...

I would give Five Guys a leg up on In n Out BECAUSE they let you decide what's on the burger to a greater extent, they have mushrooms, A-1, and BACON! and the beef just tastes better IMHO. The grease is what makes it great! If you don't want a burger with grease, go buy a Boca burger and choke on it... seriously, because you don't love food if you think that and certainly don't know what you're talking about.

Their fries are pretty damn good and actually TASTE like you're eating a potato! Which is few and far between, TBH. 

So, next time you are in the mood for a burger... THIS is the spot.. it's hearty, filling, perfect amount of a juicy, mouthwatering, foodgasm... :-)"}
{"text":"love five guys but this location must have new management and staff, went in today staff was not as friendly and when i asked for a bag to take home some peanuts (something i have always done) i was told our manger is worried about people with peanut allergy coming in to contact with the nuts outside the store so we cant let you take nuts home..... HUH? that makes no sense at all, but whatever. so sad this used to be my go to location."}
{"text":"Yummy but pricy.  The burgers have a nice beefy flavour and texture.  The topping choices are great and included in the price.  The fries are fresh and crisp.  My kids love the peanuts that are free to shell and eat-messy fun!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for the double burger with cheese. My god, I actually have cravings for them. Spicy fries are also just as awesome. 

Of course, you can't forget the free peanuts while you wait! If only hamburgers were healthy, I'd be here everyday!"}
{"text":"You've been shopping, you know you're hungry! 

The smell of the cajun spice on their special fries is enough to get anyone excited to be in here, in my opinion. However, in the big good burger brawl of the two-thousand-and-teens, I prefer In N Out and Shake Shack to Five Guys. This being said, as you can tell by the star rating, I still love this burger. 

The atmosphere at this Five Guys location is pretty dismal, though. A little dirty and cold, so I'd recommend getting take out and heading home with your shopping finds, your decent burger and your super fries."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of 5-guys, love the simple concept of their menu; you get burgers and hotdogs; you are able to customize your food but don't get too fancy they are a proud USA only company and you won't find any fancy pants Swiss Cheese here. 

I like that they have the location of where there potatoes are from. I always laugh when I walk in look at the location and say the fries last week from Barron County Wisconsin were so good I hope these guys from .....Idaho can compete;  I always get a surprised look from the people around me in line and its hilarious. 

The burgers are top notch and unless you are starving only go for a single; anything else is going to be way to much. Oh yeah and if you are there with friends only order one fry for two people.  They fill up the cup; put it into a bag and then add another scoop on top of that. 

The last time I was there I tried one of their hot dogs and it was top notch and if I can't find my new favorite Food Truck I will be coming here for a hotdog;  
I've told this story a few times as well when asked about this restaurant and it goes to show you how good their food is here; when this chain came to Omaha it was a 30 minute drive from my side of town.  My friend dragged me out there and it blew me away. The very next day I drove my father out there and he loved it and asked that I take him out there the next day. I ate this restaurant and food three days in a row and loved every meal I had there.  I was so glad when they opened a store near my dads house as that saved me a lot of gas money. 

5-guys is always worth a visit and you won't leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"When it comes to burgers, 5-guys hit's it on the nose. Sure they are more expensive then In-n-Out, but you get a whole lot more burger and toppings to! The menu is simple with just burgers, fries and drinks available, but all the more worthwhile when you add it all together. 

Glad to see they finally opened one up here in town. Granted, being that it is the only one, it stays pretty busy throughout the day and evening, so be prepared to wait a bit for your your burger."}
{"text":"On en a tellement entendu parler de cette cha√Æne aux √âtats que √ßa a caus√© une commotion √† Montr√©al lorsqu'ils ont d√©cid√© de s'√©tablir!

{"text":"Step up from a fast food burger. This five guys is pretty clean but they looked short staffed. Girl that was calling the numbers wasn't too loud."}
{"text":"low key, fresh taste, good fries.  like the peanuts while wating"}
{"text":"this is the best burger in madison. i know its a chain but every time i go im never let down. the cajun fries are FANTASTIC. and the burgers are always juicy. go to five guys for delicious burgers, a great restaurant atmosphere, and some peanuts!"}
{"text":"After two disappointments at the York Mills location, I decided to give Five Guys another chance. Upon taking my first bite of my cheeseburger, I immediately noticed that it was much better than the burgers I had at York Mills. I give the ones I had before a 2.5/5 but this one was a solid 4/5. It actually tasted fresh and juicy. Even the fries here taste better. They had some potato skin on them and were hot and satisfying. I didn't feel like I got my money's worth before but the experience with this location makes me more willing to pay $8-9 for a burger. Good, fast and friendly service too."}
{"text":"Hire an exterminator. Dirty bathrooms, dirty dining room. This is so consistent with every 5 guys anymore."}
{"text":"Food is not bad, not great, ok.  Service was great.  But if I had to choose between Five Guys and In-N-Out.  I will go to In-N-Out next time.  Got a Bacon Burger.  Nothing fabulous, just ok.  Patties were  a little dry.  Nice to be able to dress the burger with additional toppings at no charge.  Lots of fries, but nothing special, like In-N-Out's better.  Wish they had shakes."}
{"text":"-Cheeseburger and small fries = almost $14 after tax.  W T F
-Presentation is terrible...foil on burger? 
-Fries tossed inside the bag = doused in grease
-Food itself was ok, but really is something I could make at home and it would taste the same
-Why the f are there peanuts everywhere?  Peanuts do not belong with burgers

shameful."}
{"text":"The cheeseburger was tasty, the fries were fabulous, customer service was outstanding!

That being said I still think it was a bit pricey.  The restaurant was clean, however, and they did have bags of peanuts that you could nosh on."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are good if you have an addiction to grease and salt. Also they are very expensive. When they first open and people got to experience five guys business continues to fall."}
{"text":"Pros- Good tasting burger, good tasting toppings.
Con- overpriced. $6 for one patty (many free toppings to choose from, such as bacon, mushrooms, grilled onions) 
I like Smashburger better. I guess if you like the free peanuts and eat a ton of them, it may be worth $6."}
{"text":"Cheap place in an expensive neighborhood, fast and not bad, the peanuts are free. Little terrasse available outside if you prefer avoid the high air conditioner..."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! The HUGE, fresh, all beef burgers are made to order with any toppings you choose.  The cook is literally waiting to hear the order as you are ordering. A large order of their delicious fries is more than enough to feed three adults because I think they throw in an extra cupful into the bag.  It was the most delicious fresh made burger I've ever had by far!!  Very nice, simple menu, clean and simple atmosphere with really, really great burgers and fries!! We LOVE it!!"}
{"text":"Just got takeout with an $8 chase pay coupon. Still paid almost 7.00 for a bacon cheeseburger and fries. The Cajun fries were not edible. Literally caked in season salt and were soggy. Ended up throwing them away. Burger was good but still overpriced for the normal 8.99 price. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Never again, i've learned my lesson!  Don't get me wrong, the burgers here are good but a cheeseburger, regular fries and a regular drink for over $13 buck??  Imagine if i brought my family of 5 to this fast food burger joint and having to spend over $65. Are you kidding me?? The burgers better have foie gras on it and the fries sprinkled with triffles!   In-n-out burgers are just as good if not better but you can spend less than half of what five guys charges.  Is it because they give you all the fries than most humans can eat (not necessary), which by the way, need to be cooked just a bit longer.  I think the appeal to most people is the fact that they have so many toppings to choose from and you can customize it like you want.  To me it's all about the burger meat itself and while it was ok, it did not blow my mind.  Cut the price in half and yes it would justify and would probably earn more returning customers."}
{"text":"So, where do I start with Five Guys burgers and fries? Let's begin with the service, everyone is genuinely courteous! Mostly all the staff smile and makes sure I'm okay. A young lady even came up to me to ask if I wanted her to get me a refill or more fries! What great service! Now there's the most important part, the food. The burgers are near flawless, with the abundant amount of choices you have for toppings. You must get bacon in your burger as well! Now, I know what you're thinking. A lot of places, when you order bacon in your burger. You get this rubbery, chewy piece of meat. But Five Guy's bacon is as crispy as can be. Fries are also tasty, Cajun is what I prefer though. So if you're in the mood for a burger. Five guys is a must try!"}
{"text":"I'm sad. I used to have lunch at this Five Guys almost every Sunday with my kids or alone on my way to weekly grocery shopping. We stopped making this our go to place, because it just stopped being as good as it was when they first opened--stale buns a few times, underseasoned fries and other minor, but still annoying, occurrences. I still stop here once in awhile, but it never seems to get better. Today was definitely NOT an exception. The ordering process was smooth enough. Pleasant young girl took my order. As seems usual at this location, the other employees spent most their time enjoying their conversation rather than working. I wouldn't mind this, but one of the ketchup dispensers was empty, the garbage can stuffed full and numerous tables were dirty. The young girl did clean a few tables while I was there--but was \"corrected\" kinda harshly I thought by the other gal for wearing her apron while doing it. (At least she was working!!) On to the food...  my cajun fries were bland but hot and fresh. I'm not sure if they usually add salt in addition to the cajun, but they tasted like there wasn't any salt, just heat. My burger (little hamburger with fixings) was very overcooked--maybe while they were busy chatting--and unpleasantly dry and crispy. Additionally, there wasn't nearly enough ketchup or mustard to even help the situation. But the worst offensive was the (once again) stale bun. At stated above, this seems to have become a chronic problem. I'm not talking about over-toasted; I mean dry and crumbly through and through. There are at least four other parties ahead of me while I was there at 2pm, so I can't imagine why the buns aren't fresh. But, for me, this really hinders my eating here. It ruins the whole burger experience, even if the rest wasn't as bad as today. Add to this the already mentioned lack of care to the dining area, as well as coke machines mostly out of syrup choices, and I doubt I'll be back anytime soon! I would say I'll miss you five guys, but I won't miss this!!"}
{"text":"I have been trying to eat a little healthier lately but every now and then I have to have my burger and fries. I happened to be near Five Guys on Eastern so stopped in. The guy taking my order was super friendly and helpful. 

I ordered a \"junior\" cheeseburger which is one patty and added my complimentary toppings. I do like that you can add as many toppings as you want with no extra charge. We also ordered a regular fries which was plenty for two to share. 

When I opened my wrapping the first thing I noticed was the bun was smashed down, like someone used their hand to press it down. The actual burger, despite the many toppings was really lacking flavor. The fries were also disappointing. I appreciate that the fries are fresh peeled and skin on, but they were very limp and needed to be more crispy. Overall a definite two star experience. With so many better burger options on Eastern I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Five Guys is located on an increasingly busy South Blvd, but luckily it has ample parking in back (unlike many South Blvd. eateries). 

A casual diner style with burlap sacks of potatoes stacked in the dining area and framed newspaper reviews on the walls. You stroll up to the counter and place your order. Choice of condiments and fixings, regular fries or seasoned. I got a little cheeseburger (which was plenty big) and a basket of cajun fries to share. 

Burgers are cooked fresh and they boast that their meat is never frozen. Their ingredients are fresh, but their basic burger, unfortunately tasted pretty basic. As for their cajun fries, they were OK, but reminded me more of BBQ seasoning on potato chips. 

The Five Guys fan club is still quite the unexplained phenomena to me.  It's not a bad burger place, but it's not very noteworthy either."}
{"text":"Five guys is nice and let me tell you why. Burger heaven and \"boardwalk style\" fries. 

Little burger is one patty and a burger is two patties. They have have cheese and bacon options too. Don't want a patty at all, you can go veggie but it's not a veggie patty. It's just veggies in between the buns. They also have a grilled cheese option. 

Paleo, Whole 30, low carb? You have options to low carb and go paleo by ordering a lettuce wrap or bowl. Ordering whole30 is easy too. Patties are compliant, just stay away from non compliant sides like mayo, ketchup, cheese and etc. 

Five guys doesn't season their patties and I'm okay with that. I can always add salt and pepper.  But what they have is always fresh and cooked to order. 

I love placing my order online and having it ready for pickup once I arrive. The only thing you ever have to wait for on a web order is the fries if you order. 

And the fries are good. You can get them regular or Cajun seasoned. Fried perfectly in peanut oil. And I like mine with a side of malt vinegar. (Not allowed on my current whole30 diet, but when I can grub on it it's just so good). 

And of course, the free peanuts. Help yourself and munch away while you're waiting for your food. 

So prior to a paleo/whole30 lifestyle we enjoyed five guys. And even after we can still enjoy five guys. Makes this a winner in my book for sure!!"}
{"text":"The most memorable part of dining at Five Guys Burgers and Fries is the suped up soda machine.  It dispenses ice, and has a touch screen that let's you select amongst 121 drink options (sodas, sweet teas) and another four brewed teas.  Thank the Forerunners that the burger ordering process here does not involved that much overwhelming choices.

As far as burgers go, it is a decent burger made with fresh ingredients. And the toppings are already included in the asking price, and you can customize your burger with as much or little of it as your heart desire.

Taste wise, I still think In-n-Out is better. But it definitely beats out burgers served at your typical fast food joints.  Plus they do not have the flexibility of allowing you to customize your toppings as you would at a Five Guys Burger location.

Grab the peanuts if you want, it is complimentary.  But the soda machine is my top reason for coming back.  Seriously, where was this machine when we were little and have friends that make drinks with every flavor sodas that comes out of the soda fountain???

Decor/Ambiance:  4/5  Simple no frills fast food restaurant tables and chairs.  Brightly lit.

Food:  3.5/5  No complaints, it is like burgers you get at a back yard BBQ, without the burnt patties or lighter fluid flavoring.  Solid but not gourmet.

Value:  3.5/5  Costs more than other fast food, but uses better ingredients. You get what you pay for.

Service:  4/5.  The cashier was great at describing what they serve making my first visit here as un-daunting as possible.

Cleanliness:  4.5/5  The staff here keeps the place nice and clean, even during the dinner rush.  Good job!

Parking:  4/5  Should not be an issue.

Overall, I would rate Five Guys Burgers and Fries more than just A-Ok (3 stars) but not quite 4 stars.  Will be back though, especially to explore what else the soda machine is capable of serving up.

Only thing missing, IMO are milk shakes."}
{"text":"Better than in- n- out for sure!!! Double bacon cheeseburger with mushrooms is amazing!!! Can't believe this place has so many bad reviews!!! Minus one star bc their fries suck!!!"}
{"text":"\"All American in my homeland!\"

Nothing better than a good old American burger. I've been to quite a few places throughout Canada and the US but I come back to Five Guys when I want to have a decent burger.
Two patties on a soft bun with so many toppings, it's a meal with all four food groups!
There are better burgers from fancy restaurants but I have to admit that Five Guys is the king of the chain restaurants. We have Hero's, South Street, and the standard chains but overall this is my fav.
Get the burger \"All the Way or the Works\" and you won't be disappointed. If you are want fries, get them cajun and don't over order, a medium is extra-large, large is a feast. Since this is American, don't expect gravy or a poutine - nor onion rings! Just a good burger at a fair price.
MMMMmmmm...Yum!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with a five guys bacon cheeseburger and fry. If you're looking for a great gourmet burger look no further!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a good cheeseburger this is the place to go!
The menu super simple. There's lots of way to customize your cheeseburger with a whole bunch of different toppings.

On a side note make sure you only order a small burger if you want a single patty or regular burger for two patties.

Learned that the hard way. Two Patty is just too much meat.
I do think they need to add Sriracha to their topping list. ;-)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening at 6:30pm. Had a Hamburger and Cajun Fries. I've had the veggie sandwich and little cheeseburger before, both also good. You can put as many topings as you'd like for the cheeseburger and hamburger! They also always overfill your cup of fries, probably double the size of the cup itself. It's a nice gesture for the price you're paying. I prefer the cajun fries over five guys style. 

The difference between the original and Little versions is that you pay $2 for an extra patty. Cheeseburgers cost $1 more than hamburgers because you get a slice of cheese. You can also get your burger bunless. I haven't seen anyone do that yet, but it's something I'll try one day just for the sake of having a bunless burger."}
{"text":"As always a big fannof Five Guys. I like this location as this is conveniently located within the Heartland Centre. As always Love the burgers and fries cajun style."}
{"text":"I spent 20 minutes scouring yelp as to whether I should go Cajun Style or Five Guys Style for my fry order and no one answered my question.

I am here for you Yelp. Get ready.

The answer is location based. If you are eating in the restaurant, cajun style it up if you like a little fry kick. 
Five Guys Style itself is traditional all the way. Cooked in Peanut Oil, lightly salted, crisp good times.
But if you like extra seasoning and spice, cajun style ahoy hoy. Otherwise you can get regular style, take it home and apply seasoning salt at home.

Words of caution. If you have a peanut allergy, STAY AWAY! Peanuts in the shell, peanuts in the oil, peanuts in the air, there is a peanut-ie magic everywhere.

They also now have a veggie sandwich on the menu. So vegetarians who don't want a child's grilled cheese sandwich and something more than fries, rejoice!

I think the special moment for me was taking my order home, and unwrapping that magical foiled burger and seeing the mass of melted processed cheese out the sides. 
Grilled onions should be offered as a topping for free everywhere."}
{"text":"Clean, never a line at this location, ya it's expensive...if you get the regular sized burger and fries...here's a tip, I just started ordering the \"little\" version. The burger is no happy meal sized burger, it's bigger than most regular fast food chain burgers, I can't imagine what the normal size would be like. And you know they always dump more fries in your bag than the cups can hold so it's like getting a larger portion for a lot less! Trust me, just try it one day, and you'll see you get plenty full. 
Only thing I could possibly dislike is how instantly greasy the bag they give you gets because they throw all the fries in it. May ask them to double bag or something, hate taking it back to work and it leaving grease spots on my car seat or at my work desk wherever I set it down."}
{"text":"Good burger but expensive. Nice treat.  Me and friend went and ordered two burgers and two fries. Next time will skip fries and just order one as huge portion. Toppings on burger are great...what a treat. Probably has a bazillion calories so will not be a regular place to eat at."}
{"text":"I was excited to see that they were opening a Five Guys that was closer to where I lived because I have heard so many good things about this place. This location just opened up a few days ago. Today I was in the area and decided to try it out for lunch. 

When I walked in, all the friendly employees immediately greeted me. When it was my turn to order, the cashier asked me if this was my very first visit, and took a minute to explain the menu to me. This is what I learned:

-The regular burgers have 2 beef patties
-The little burgers have 1 beef patty
-Toppings are free, you pick which ones you want
-They also have hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches
-They don't have any combo meals, so you just order everything separately
-They offer free peanuts
-They pack your food in a brown paper bag, regardless of whether you are eating in or taking it to go

I ordered:

-Little Cheeseburger (with lettuce and ketchup): nothing wrong with the beef patty, it was pretty juicy and tasty. The problem was the bun. It was waaaay too soggy, to the point where eating the burger was not enjoyable. I guess I just prefer grilled bread, or slightly crispy buns, like how they do it at In-N-Out.

-Regular Fries (Five Guys style): nothing special. Most of it was soggy, so I only ate a few and had to throw the rest away. 

I do have to say that this place is very clean. I think I saw three employees wiping down the tables, the windows, and sweeping the floor while I was waiting for my food. 

I'm glad I got to try this place. But unfortunately, I wasn't impressed and feel it is over hyped. If I ever come back, I would probably try one of their hot dogs. 

I'll stick to In-N-Out and Smashburger."}
{"text":"Five Guys has great food, but the service is lacking. 

I've been turned away 15 minutes before the posted closing time, and just last night when I did make it inside, on time, I (my group of 3 people) was repeatedly reminded that \"it's practically closing time, we close right now, just so you know, for next time...\" 

Two of the three orders were incorrect as well. SO, if you go well before closing time, everything is generally delicious and staff is great, but damn those grumpy closers..."}
{"text":"I don't want to hate on Five Guys, I really don't. Maybe I'm jaded. (See my other review from the State Street location and their sub-par customer service.) I was SO excited when this east side Five Guys opened up. It's not far from my work or my home, so I thought, \"great! Another lunch-time option in the 'hood!\"

First order, placed online, for a specific pick-up time, was received but never made. So that is not a good start. Staff was not overly apologetic about this mistake, and the added 15 min wait either. I understand they are a new store, but come on. 

The burger was greasy, that's expected of Five Guys. The fries were mushy. Just overall very.. meh. With Culvers also right down the street, FG really needs to step up their game."}
{"text":"5 guys is always good but Raheam made this experience extra special. Raheam had a great personality from the start. He was great to talk too and made other guest laugh as well as fellow employees. He seemed to really enjoy work and all the people around him. He also got me to spend way more than I planned on but I was happy with it. 

My double bacon cheese burger with everything was fantastic. The free peanuts and fancy drink machine really put the experience over the top. The location was also very clean. 

Thanks again to Raheam for having such a great personality! I'll have to get that coffee milkshake on my next visit!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time at a Five Guys. I ordered a Burger, Small Fries and a Small Soda. The Burger was exactly how I ordered it and it was juicy/tasty. The fries where in a small cup. Then a container was filled and they dumped the extra fries into the bag. They are tasty, large skin on fries. The soda machine had allot of choices. Was very happy they had my favorite, hard time find, Cherry/Vanilla Coke. The total price was a little over $10.00. It was worth it but a bit too expensive for my tight budget."}
{"text":"After a cool night of sampling drinks and treats at the very first Yelp Helps event at CityScape (downtown), I thought I finally try this place since it's so conveniently nearby.  Well, with mediocre expectations actually, I was not impressed with their BURGER.

I was really, really hoping that it would be better than this! Really! :)

I ordered their \"Little\" cheese burger, which is a single patty burger.  I added my favorite toppings, mushrooms and onions, no extra cost (btw).  For sides, I ordered their Regular Cajun Fries that came in like a 16 oz. cup.  Excellent, seasoned very well and soft and tasted very, very POTATO-ee.  I would go back just for that.

The two problems to me were the BUNs and the PATTY.  If I didn't know any better, the buns were made of saw dust or card board! During the process of them compiling the burger, I did not see them toasting or buttering the buns like most places would.

The patty was not juicy or had that beefy flavor, I tasted mostly the DRY buns.  Same applied to my toppings, the mushrooms and onions. I felt the buns overrode everything!

Victory to the FRIES."}
{"text":"I love Five Guys. I have probably been to at least a dozen different locations in several different states and most of them are the same which is a good thing. Providing a consistent experience is important. 

This Five Guys is pretty good. The people seems pretty nice though there wasn't anything exceptional to point out. 

I do like it when the Five Guys have the Fusion Coke Machines which this location has which is a plus."}
{"text":"Five Guys....YUM. I like this chain. Originally from Washington D.C. they put all kinds of stuff on your burger for you and they give you a ridiculous amount of fresh cut fries. I'm sure you have been here so you either like it or you don't. 

This review is about this location in Oakland and I have to say that I was impressed. The employees were very nice and they came out to the table and offered to take trash and get refills. I have been to several Five Guys and they have never offered to do so. 

I will be back thanks to the great service and food."}
{"text":"Service: 4/5 -not as quick as McDonalds or Wendy's, but that's because they make the patties when they are ordered. 

Employees: 4.5/5 -very friendly and helpful

Food: 3/5 -not a super tasty patty, but they offer a bunch of free toppings (ketchup, mushrooms, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, etc) 

**tip: the normal burger has two patties!!"}
{"text":"Five guys have quite an enviable reputation for a burger chain, and in my opinion it's totally deserved.

Not as cheap as expected, but for the money you get a huge amount of food, and that's a good food, real deal, straight to the point. Yes, those are burgers. No, they are not healthy. Gosh, who cares if you want one!

I spent quite some time exploring different \"gourmet burger\" places, and pretty much most of them resulted to be ambitious junk - selling expensive crap, easily beaten by a professionally made burger from a good restaurant, for the same price.

Five guys are selling good burgers, without false ambitions - and are totally recommended. Just get your beer elsewhere to make that belly totally happy."}
{"text":"Luckily my brother and I came in at a time when it wasn't busy. It was pricey. Came up to $26.62 for a little bacon cheeseburger, regular bacon cheeseburger, regular fries and large drink. 

It was fast enough service considering they cook the patties from when it's pink. After we got our food, they told us to have a good day as we were leaving.

Great place."}
{"text":"Ok, am pretty sure you have heard of Five Guys Burger & Fries, and had probably thought what a peculiar name for a burger joint, like couldn't they could've come up with a much better name? Thankfully the burgers and fries live up to its reputation. Once you walk in you will get that home grown American vibe, they have complimentary roasted peanuts you can munch on, no throwing peanut shells on the floor though like I've seen in some good ole American steak houses. Make sure you have your order ready by the time you get to the cashier in order to avoid the other hungry customers glaring at you. The menu is pretty simple, yet you might find yourself confused when you get to the counter. Yes it is pretty pricy for a fast food burger joint, I mean we are talking about $5 burgers here. The cheapest burger is called the little burgers and they are about $5. The name is a bit deceiving because you would think that little would be the size of sliders, but they are actually regular size burgers with only 1 patty. The \"Bigger\" burger will have 2 patties. Pretty much it is a build your own burger, you choose what goes on your burger like grilled onions, mushrooms, jalape√±os etc at no additional cost. They have hot dogs too as well as vegetarian items. The drinks are like almost $3 each, but that's because they have a state of the art soda dispenser with a plethora of choices where you can drink to your heart's content. The steak cut fries are definitely the highlight of this establishment! Crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside, plus a bonus of extra helpings just to keep you satisfied. They put a sign telling you where the potato used for the fries came from so you know that it's fresh.  To sum it all up it is just good ole American burger and fries, nothing fancy schmancy about it, but as they say simplicity is beauty. Once you figure what and how to order, it doesn't seem that pricy any more. For me this is my go to place for a guilty pleasure. If I have to compare this place to our local In N Out Burger, I have to say its a totally different flavor, In N Out is good too, this is also good as well, I guess you just have to decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Since relocating offices from our midtown branch to our downtown branch, not only have I experienced a dramatic decrease in stress (begone, Dragon Lady!!), but I've also been able to expand my lunch dining portfolio. One that I was eager to add is Five Guys. I've stuck with the Little Bacon Cheeseburger with mayo and hot sauce (yeah, I'm weird) and tried both regular and Cajun fries (go with the Cajun). Aside from it being so busy and spending an average of 8 minutes in line and 9 minutes waiting for my burger, I've been very happy with Five Guys."}
{"text":"The new location on 130th is very popular.  I love that Five Guys has real beef patties and they have embraced the peanut oil in their french fries.    However, because the patties are fresh, they are not efficient and it takes far too long to get \"fast food\"

I love that Five Guys allows for a wide variety of toppings, and that when you order fries, you get a whole bunch extra in your bag.  I just wish they could handle crowds more efficiently."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the burgers here.  The choice in toppings and the bun make this a delicious burger.  

However, fast food it is not.   Ordering, even on a slow day takes awhile and you will wait quite a long time for your meal.   Overall its a great burger, but not if you are looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Absolutely love it!! Never disappoints, great food, great people working here .the only downside is its kinda pricy but really good. I really love the soda machine of many flavors ,its pretty cool. Im definelty coming here at least once a month"}
{"text":"I love the burgers, anywhere that welcomes customization to your food is good in my books. I love that you can get exactly what you want and they don't charge you per little thing you ask for. I rarely eat fries out of taste preference however I actually enjoy the fries here. They are cooked in peanut oil so beware if you have allergies. Now if only they could make a low fat version that tasted just as good I would eat there everyday"}
{"text":"From working for three different five guys locations the staff could use a little more energy. I know what the business is all about because I was a former employee for them back home in California for about three years. They could use some energy! However I'll give them quality on their burgers. Every time we've gone in our burgers were perfect. I usually get no bun and do a lettuce wrap.. their lettuce is on point. Green and fresh! They also aren't stingy with their barbeque sauce!  Yay! My only complaint about the food is the fries. A little soggy and not really fresh. Could use some work on that. 

But overall, I love five guys!"}
{"text":"So close to my 100 review here is 98 


a -1 as a burger option check jalapeno's check cheddar cheese yes. If they had bacon I would be 1 happy camper, or at least needing a nap afterward this . I kinda stumbled on this being out here today not realizing what food coma I could get me into. I got bored of pizzas Thankfully everything was cooked right even in and out sometimes under cooks burgers but hey it happens. Will be back"}
{"text":"Just got take-out from this place.  The cajun fries were wayyy over seasoned.  I like salty stuff (most people think that I over-salt my food) but these were just unbearable.  Caked in salty seasoning.  The burgers just weren't very good and were super wet.  The bun was just decomposing while I tried to eat the thing.  I don't even mean that delicious greasy awesomeness, more like someone dunked the patties in water before assembling the burger.  Eating the burger was just an annoying mess. 

The only good thing was the shake, but at $5 for maybe 14oz it was just too expensive.  Actually the whole meal was super pricey.  Two burgers, a large fries, and one shake was $28.10 out the door.  Geezus.

I remember getting food from this place a while back and thinking it was ok so I'll give it two starts instead of one, but it should probably just be one."}
{"text":"friendly service. burgers are average. buns are terrible. very expensive"}
{"text":"Burgers are ok. They need better buns."}
{"text":"First time here, and I have to admit I won't be back.  The burger overall was ok I guess, definitely not worth the price.

Burger patties were simple, unseasoned, and fried.  The toppings were fresh but un-inspired, something I'd expect at a 50's drive thru in the US I imagine.

The fries were ok, fresh cut and fried well.  The cajun seasoning was barely noticeable.  

Over all a mediocre burger and fries for too much money.  

The actual restaurant was clean and the staff were friendly and efficient.

D"}
{"text":"Cheese burger and a soda...$10 bucks...YIKES!!!

Cheese burger was meh at best.  Wildly over priced and not worth the cost.

They have one of those soda machines with a gazillion choices.  That was ok."}
{"text":"Good but not great.  Better (or at least equally good) burgers can be had for less. Fries are generally under cooked. Good news they have malt vinegar for the fries so they have that going for them.

All in all, not sure what the hype is all about."}
{"text":"Told the cashier it was my first time nd he said I wud love it, nd boy was he  right ,best I've ever had,very friendly staff will be going back 2ma for more"}
{"text":"It was such a disappointment on our visit tonight.  Apparently Five Guys has changed everything about the way they do things.  The burgers are still amazing, that wasn't the issue.  It was the customer service and the skimpy amount of fries they give now.  We ordered a regular fry which goes for $4.29 and the amount you get is now equal to what we used to get in a small fry.  I wanted to insure we hadn't gotten the wrong size given to us so I went to the counter and Blaine approached.  I asked if it was the correct size and he said Yes, that is the regular and turned around and walked away.  I called to him and asked if they had reduced the amount that was given and he said No, and walked away again.  All he had to do was act liked he even cared instead he chose the arrogant young kid that wasn't going to be wrong.  We love Five Guys but this was terribly disappointing and we won't be back at this store again."}
{"text":"I always like the burgers, but I also like the friendly staff. One of the guys that was handing out the orders noticed that the people he was serving were hard of hearing so he didn't hesitate, walked right out and served them at their table. Good group"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, same great food. They are quicker than most I have been to. Never a bad experience, although they could use some extra help cleaning the tables."}
{"text":"I didn't blindly walk into 5 guys thankfully as the red and white retro decor and watching the staff flip burgers may make you feel like ordering a Tab to get your caffeine.

There are disclaimers on the door, by the menu and multiple other places informing you if you are allergic to peanuts a) there are peanuts shelled and eaten here and b) food is cooked in peanut oil.  So even though I like the greasy food it is not worth using an EpiPen or a trip to the ED.  

The food.  Burgers are priced in a $7 range which might seem expensive at first, but they're cooked immediately instead of being warmed and there's a heck of a lot of toppings you can throw on them.  It's practically a salad on your bun except not as healthy.  And they're double patties...just so you are aware when ordering fries.

My daughter is gluten free, but it wasn't an issue as all burgers and dogs can be cooked with no bun and it was a decent sized (and tasty) hot dog.  It got an \"Mmmm\" out of her and that's a high compliment.

The place is clean, bright and the entryway was a tad loud as a speaker was in it, but it muffles other conversations and I barely heard toddlers in the restaurant.  It loses a star as I really wish they'd have something even a bit healthier on the menu.  A turkey burger or side of fruit as an option?"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers that I have ever had...next to mine own of course.
So why only 4 stars and not 5 you may ask. Well if you must know...I don't care for their fries. I like my French fries crispier than how they make it.
The menu is very simple. Little burger or regular burger which comes with 2 juicy patties. Then all the various toppings that you want. 
Did I say how juicy the burger is? If not, it is a very juicy burger that is well cooked. 
For the price, the burgers are worth it! 

I can't wait til it opens in Mililani Hawaii"}
{"text":"The best burgers in town at a fast food restaurant. Cajun fries are tasty too. They have the coolest soda dispenser at this location. Hey, I never knew they had Orange and Rasberry Diet Coke."}
{"text":"5 stars for burgers 2 for service. Ate at 5 Guys in Orlando after hearing about it from all people, President Obama. I love me a good burger. They are delish here! They just opened in the Phx area. I love their food but the wait was horrid. Extra horrid! They also have no seating. You have to go out in the mall, which was packed.  The service wasn't that great but I do love their hamurgers! YUMMY! They do have a few other locations opening up in Downtown and North Phoenix so I will try them out. They might be less crowded."}
{"text":"Hmm, I don't know what I was expecting. I was in the area and while browsing around my bookmarks remembered I was interested in trying Five Guys. 

I ordered the small hamburger with jalapenos, hot sauce, grilled mushrooms and onions. I'm one of those weird people who doesn't usually like cheese on my burgers. The meat was fresh and tasty, but nothing that blew me away. I like the fact that all the toppings are included. The only problem is that when given so many options, I'm often at a loss of what to order. Indecisiveness gets me every time.

The food was a bit pricy as well. For just a small burger and drink I paid just over $6. I probably won't become a regular here, but if you're in the mood for a tasty burger, stop on by."}
{"text":"Holy cow! I like it better than boardwalk I think...kinda the same league as fat burger.

As of price wise....same as fat burger I would say.  

The only downside is they are short staff. Which takes away from the timeliness of the service other wise I would say they are amazing.

I love how you get lots of fries despite that the size is small. I didn't get to try their milk shake but apparently is good.

 also provides fresh peanuts. While you wait...for your food 

They recommended double cheese bacon burger and that's what my friend got...i had a smaller size which is perfect if you don't eat lots.

I would definitely go back again....though I wanna see maybe 1 more person to take care of cash and maybe tidy up the lobby..."}
{"text":"Ok, I was a little torn on this one. I wanted to give it 4 stars but this is why it only received 3. 

THREE STAR REASONS: 

First, it was a little pricey. 25 dollars and some change for 1 bacon cheeseburger, 1 little bacon cheeseburger, 1 little cheeseburger, 1 regular Cajun fry and 2 regular drinks. 

Second, the fries even though hand cut they weren't hot and actually could have been cooked a little more, they still were a little hard in the middle. If they would have been left in the fryer a few seconds longer they totally would have reminded me of the fries my Mother made at home.

WORTH 4 STARS: 

First, the uber cool beverage dispensers. 

Second, the service was fast and friendly even though they were extremely busy. 

Three, the burger. It was hot, gooey, loaded with all of the fresh toppings I asked for. I loved the taste of the sesame seed bun. I can't find any fault with the burger except the $5.29 price. 

Is it great food? No, it's good for fast food, but honestly for the $25 my husband, son and I could have had a nice lunch at a sit down restaurant for the same price. Would I go back. Yes if I was in the area and wanted a burger."}
{"text":"The oreo cookie shake was awesome!  The burger was great too.  The fries were a bit too salty for my taste though, more so than their other locations.  They also were a bit soggy, not crisp enough.  Still, very filling if that is what you're looking for."}
{"text":"I took an entire group of clients to this location and everyone had a great experience and enjoyed their meal.  They certainly don't cheat you.  Double patties, a ton of fries overflowing and filling up the bag, and a quality meal.  The service was quick for lunchtime considering all the orders, and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Today I chose Five Guys for lunch. I believe this place is a chain burger place like In-and Out. At least it has that feel when you enter the restaurant. My choose was a bacon burger with lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion,mustard. No fries as I don't need the calories. The burger comes with two pieces of meat. From all appearance it looked like a very good burger. To my surprise it had very little taste. All the makings was there but no taste. 
But then I have been spoiled from eating at Rocket Burger."}
{"text":"Every now and again, DH convinces me to go to Five Guys for a quick dinner. 

They're fast, friendly and filling.  And who doesn't like free peanuts (okay, maybe those allergic to peanuts... but boo hoo)?

The fries are pretty delicious and three people can easily share a regular sized order (sometimes with leftovers).

The burgers are just okay.    They're not too greasy, but they're lacking in flavor.  I like that you can get unlimited toppings for no extra charge, but even the toppings are meh.  The grilled onions aren't half as good as In N Out's (maybe they don't use something delicious like butter to grill them in?).  The mushrooms have NO FLAVOR at all.  The jalapenos are mild.

The barbecue sauce is good, but it reminds me of the one they serve on the Rodeo Cheeseburger at BK.

It is annoying, however, that they don't have a true kids' menu.  Charging $3.69 for a simple piece of American cheese on a grilled bun is ludicrous!  C'mon guys... Make the grilled cheese a kids menu item and serve it with a kid-sized fry and a small drink or SOMETHING for that price.  

Other than that, I think the price is right.

Overall, I like Five Guys.  It's just not my first choice for a fast food burger.  

Here's my favorite burger locally in the same price range: http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-chuck-box-tempe#hrid:m3XWdhV7arDtfjzqYG7pIw"}
{"text":"I would say this is a 3,5 star burger place.  

The burger is solid with nice flavors and fresh lettuce, onion and tomato. 
I had mayo, mustard and ketchup on my burger.  

Ive read a lot about the discussions about the eastcoasts Five Guys vs In n out on the west coast and for me theres really not that much of a fight.  
Yes \"Five Guys\" is a good burger (among many others) but there are some crucial things that seperates the two.  

*If Five Guys is a 3,5 in taste, In n out are always a 5!,
*Appearence. Five Guys looks kind of sad as a burger especially compared to In n out's picture perfect burger goodness. 
*Price. I paid 10 $ for a burger with fries and soda at FG.  A double double with fries and soda at In n out will set you back about 6,50 $!  

Conclusion: Five Guys is a nice burgerplace when the cravings set in and you dont have the In n out joint close by."}
{"text":"Holy overpriced!  With everyone all abuzz about this place opening up in AZ, I figured we would have to give it a try sometime.  Well, we were out and about in the EV this weekend and figured now was as good as ever.  Things did not start off well.  First, the music was so LOUD!  Some poor old lady walked in and covered her ears the second the door opened.  I also hated the peanut shells.  It was stupid, poorly executed and had no business being in a fast food burger joint.  Steakhouse or BBQ place, maybe, but not here.  Apparently the ordering system is difficult because it took the 6 or so people in front of us forever to order, but for us smart folk, it takes about 30 seconds.

Now to the food.  It costs 4.89 for a single patty bacon cheeseburger.  I can get a Baconator combo at Wendy's for that price.  That's just the burger here, so for an extra 2.59 I can get frys (a generous portion at least) and another couple bucks gets me a drink.  I'm practically pushing a 10 dollar combo here!  This is fast food right?  I couldn't help but compare it to In'N'Out and this place was failing miserably!  Our food came out in roughly 5-8 minutes and we went outside to eat because the music was unbearably loud.  The frys were decent, nothing to special and I found the cajun fries to be very dry feeling in my mouth.  The burger was such a disappointment.  It was small and very smashed when I opened it.  The meat was very well done, and not juicy like they said it should be.  The bacon was decent and the cheese was well, cheese.  Overall, a pretty lame burger, especially for nearly 5 bucks!

Obviously, I was disappointed.  I know 5 bucks for a burger isn't a lot, but for fast food, it really is.  It's a shame that our President hasn't had the joy of experiencing decent burgers, because this place is not good.  This place is definitely a fail for me, but at least my food was edible."}
{"text":"Wow!  Five Guys' burgers taste close to what you'd get if you made them yourself in your backyard.  The beef is never frozen, and the fries are made fresh as well.  It really makes a difference, and while the end result is a little spendy for fast food, it's definitely worth the price.  Plus, you can add any number of toppings (mushrooms, onions, etc.) at no extra cost."}
{"text":"The funny youtube videos... the whispered talk in dark alleys about a new type of burger.  A burger made from never-frozen meat, delivered fresh everyday.  A growing disturbance in the force being contributed to something called Five Guys Burgers and Fries.  Wait... why does it take five guys?  Oh my goodness oh my dayum.  :) 

Anyways... so myself and a buddy ventured north to the northern tip of Newmarket to to sink our carnivorous jaws into a five guys burger.  

First impressions:
These guys definitely SCREAM the fact that they are award winners.  The entire restaurant/fast food diner was pasted with quotes from magazines and newspapers stating how awesome they were.  Well, if you got em.. show em.  
The whole grill area is pretty open and you can see what they are doing.

Ordering:
I had to ask some questions, because yes... no combos.  So ordered the bacon cheese burger (which is actually two patties.. if you order the small burger, comes with one patty), with medium fries and a medium drink (since you fill your own drink and refills are included).  You tell them all the toppings right there, and they make it for you.  
$18 total... whoa!!!  for a burger, fries and a coke... holy snap.  Okay.. well, the place has the hype, so let's try it out. 

Got the drink and sat down, as you have to wait for your order number to be called.  Comes in plain paper brown bag, and the fries were definitely overflowing and delicious.  and Spicy... the fries DO bite back!  

So, open up this burger that seems to be wrapped in grocery store aluminum foil.  It is smaller than what I expected, but I take a bite... it's a good burger.  Yes, has that homemade taste and is delicious.  
But, my socks remained on... and my jaw did not go slack in amazement.  
But, yes, it's a tasty burger.  
So, even though I mentioned it is not large... and I can eat a phenomenal amount of food, I notice that when I am finished this medium size double patty burger.... I am well stuffed.  So, I feel that the quality definitely packs a punch.  Weird that I was that full after this burger and fries... Happy with the result.  

Overall... it is a good burger, but I do find the price tag a little big high for that.  Most of the time, if it's 18 dollars for burgers and fries... it should come with a nice cold pint!  

So, it's good yes... it's a cool experience yes... you should try it yes... you will like it yes, but I find the whole package a little high on the $ for what you are getting."}
{"text":"I went back a while ago and tried their food again.  
It was much better than the last time, but I still don't understand what their hype is.  I think they should swap out their flat grill for a broiler.  Then that'll really bring the flavor... Yum.
Yes, they use fresh ingredients, but who doesn't these days?  Especially if they charge 10+$ for a burger with drink?"}
{"text":"Been to Five Guys many times ordered the Little Bacon Burger with \"All the Way\" which makes it a good size burger. Little Bacon Burger is one beef burger patty, when I got home, it had 2 burger patties and was charged for 2 patties.

\"All the Way\" comes with mayo, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup, and mustard.¬†

Many people compare Five Guys with In N Out, I think the Five Guys Burger is bigger and has more free condiment items than the other. 

The French Fries are served in a cup and then they throw an extra scoop on top of that, so I would recommend ordering a small order of fries because of how  much they give you. The Cajun style fries are also good and a different way to mix up the normal fries.

Don't forget about the free peanuts that you can eat while waiting for your order.

I think Five Guys was one of the first places to have the modern Coke dispenser machines which are very nice and serves a good selection of different drinks.

Actually this time the bun of the burger actually held up through out the meal, generally the bun with all the items gets really soggy and messy.

Overall good food at a good price for quick meal."}
{"text":"This location is the worst, the fries where cold, the burger was okay. I am a regular at the five guys at st.Clair and Weston Rd, which is good, same with the one on the Queensway. I have eaten at this location before and it was okay. My feeling is that they are very busy, and so the quality isn't the same as the smaller locations. Honestly management should be trying to help the employees so that they are all the same. In terms of the fries, they should be cooking a little bit at a time so that they are hot when people get them. The burger wasn't bad, but it's not as good as the other locations in the city."}
{"text":"With a rough day at work, what better way to put a smile on my face, right? 

Five Guys didn't let me down. You could see everyone working together to make sure every customer got their order and that it was correct... I even saw the manager have another team member quick switch my burger when it came off the grill with the person's behind me... that person had cheese and I didn't. Good to know they care about the details."}
{"text":"Burgers cooked to order with fresh ground beef a good selection of toppings and fresh cut fries on the side.  What's not to like?  The Five Guys founders knew what they were doing when they started this booming franchise.  Simple and fresh will win the day as \"burger\" will sell itself when done this well cause American's love a good burger!

This location in Huntersville is clean with a friendly staff, some of whom seem to have been around since opening so I'm assuming Five Guys does a good job on the take care of team members front as well."}
{"text":"Not sure how Five Guys does it but, they somehow meet archaic NC state law against serving medium rare beef while still serving a juicy burger.  Perhaps it's the grind they use having the right amount of fat or how they cook them to order on the flattop but, they pull it off.  Lot's of fixings to choose from and the fries are just delicious.  Fresh cut and fried to close to perfection with a choice of plain or Cajun seasoned.  Any place that lists the location of \"Today's Potato's\" and also offers malt vinegar to douse them in has to take fries seriously.

The staff at this location does a great job of keeping the burgers and fries coming no matter how busy they are and are always friendly.  High marks for the total package!"}
{"text":"Best burger and fries i've ever had....burgers are fresh and juicy try it and you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Bomb burger.  Trust me if you don't like Five Guys then hate your mom for making horrible burgers your whole life and ruining your pallet for a good burger.  The upside from In and Out is the choices to add to your burger but we still need In and Out for that spread and grilled onions."}
{"text":"Still some of the best burgers and fries in America. But this store is a bit below standard. It was messy, tables not clean. The food took forever, though the guy did apologize for it. The staff was great, unlike Hertz. I'd go back but not out of my way."}
{"text":"Great service with good food. What more can I asked for?

Most of my friends make fun of me for getting a burger this weekend. I don't blame them. Since 90% of my diets are Asian food, me having a burger must be a major shock for them Lol. Anyhoo...I ordered a small burger (which is basically a regular size burger) with Cajun French fries. I also ordered a Oreo cookie milk shake to go with it. Everything is absolutely delicious. My favorite is the Cajun French fries. It is covered with seasoning and I basically finished the whole thing.

I really wish I didn't have to eat out of a paper bag, but I believe this is how all five guys are.....other than that, I'll definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Don't get the fries! Burgers were fresh and about what you'd expect for a $6 burger. The free peanuts are a plus. If you do order fries, expect to eat to eat about 2 lbs of soggy grease potatoes. Somehow, the fryer temperature is never high enough to make nice crispy fries."}
{"text":"You know there must be something must be good here if it's a chilly Sunday afternoon and a there's a line up to the door!
Some might argue the prices here a little steep but they definitely make that up in quality and portion sizes.
Burgers are made with 100% fresh never frozen ground beef, they use peanut oil, and everything on the menu is trans fat free!

The line moved rather quickly, ironically they had 5 guys working behind the counter to keep things running smoothly.
After you place your order you can have a seat and wait until the number on your receipt is called. To pass the time make sure you grab a handful of the free peanuts! Perfectly salted and roasted, they make for some nice nibbles to pass the time.

The standard burger here comes with TWO patties! If your a child or weakling you can opt for the small burger which contains only one patty and best of all you can go crazy with the toppings because they all FREE!

This is what I opted for on my Hamburger

Toppings - Grilled onions, Grilled mushrooms, Jalapeno peppers, Tomatoes, Ketchup, Mustard, and Hot Sauce. Everything was fresh tasting even the jalapenos still had seeds to give it extra kick, nothing was sloppy and held together well.

Meat - Both patties grilled perfectly, juicy, not overwhelmingly big, still able to take a decent size bite without dislocating my jaw.

Bun - Soft average sesame seed bun lightly toasted with good bun to patty ratio!

Cajun Fries - These are a must! Fresh cut perfectly fried and dusted in that addictive cajun spice! I got the large size and they were definitely huge in portion size, not only do they fill the cup crammed with fries but they run it over in the bag! I just ended up ripping open the bag and dumping the fries onto it, made for much easier eating. This could definitely feed a family of four or in my case two ladies with an appetite!

Free peanuts, free toppings, huge portions, self serve fountain drinks (hello free refills), two patty standard juicy burgers, fast and friendly service, it totally makes sense why this place is always packed! and don't forget those Cajun Fries!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"We eat hamburgers here often and it's one of my favorite spots. They have consistent quality and I never leave hungry. I like how you can build your own burger as I am always changing things when I order (yeah I know, there is probably a lot of spit in my food). I usually order their small bacon cheese burger, grilled onions and jalape√±o. My husband loves their Oreo shake and can't resist ordering it. Even my picky 5 year old likes their food. It is a little spendy for a burger, atmosphere is casual and lively, they usually play good music too!"}
{"text":"It was OK.

I got the little bacon cheeseburger (which was actually not that little) with everything on it and added jalapenos.  The bf and I split unseasoned fries.  Everything comes out in a brown paper bag whether you're dining in or taking it to go.  If you did get a drink, they have one of those fancy Coca-Cola machines where you can add stuff into your soda.  Too bad I'm not a soda gal.

At first, the bf pulled out a small cup of fries and I thought we got jipped.  Then, he ripped open the brown paper bag on it's side to reveal a crap ton of secret fries!  It's basically like they took two cupfuls of fries, dumped it in the bag, then stuffed the cup full of fries again and put that in the bag too.  But I was happy; I love fries.  The unseasoned fries were good.  The burger was just OK.  Mine eventually fell apart though and I gave up trying to hold it together. 

If I have a burger craving, it won't be for Five Guys unfortunately.  I'd still rather run to In-N-Out to get my beef on."}
{"text":"After hearing a bit about Five Guys online, I decided to give them a try.  First impression walking in was very positive.  I liked the decor and the free self-serve peanuts.   

Unfortunately, that did not last.  My jaw literally hit the floor when I saw the prices.  Over $5 for a hamburger from a counter-service (i.e. fast-food) restaurant?  Worse yet, I had my three kids with me and Little Cheeseburgers are over $4 each.  I have to say we almost walked out, but I still wanted to try it.   So we proceeded with ordering. 

I got the hamburger with french fries.  The hamburger was very good.  No doubt about that.  The french fries were okay, but nothing special.  If the burger would have been $3 - $4, I'd probably say it was one of the best I've had in that price range.  At over $5 though, there are many just as good if not better options.

Bottom line: good food, but way overpriced."}
{"text":"Good burgers and great cajun fries.  Their method of listening to what you want on your burger and getting it all quickly together is GREAT.  They are making MY lunch, not some number on the wall that someone in corporate dreamed up,"}
{"text":"It's a ****1/2 given its quality and price.  In my humble opinion it edges out the Priest in terms of gourmet chain burgers and a lot of the one off shops (Apache, P&L, Rudeboy, Slab etc.)"}
{"text":"What can I say about Five Guys that hasn't already been said?  Great burgers and fries, reasonably priced, and excellent service.  This new location is a welcome addition in Market Square, tucked just behind Primanti bros. in the walkway to PPG Plaza.  The service was excellent.  Since this is a newly opened location they are extremely well staffed and attentive.  The store is SUPER CLEAN.  

Go closer to 11AM and beat the lunch rush.  Bonus tip: you can order your burger without a bun (in a foil bowl) or in a lettuce wrap.  Awesome!  You can also order extra of everything at no charge (may not apply to cheese and bacon).  I like to get extra jalapenos and hot sauce.  I don't limit myrself to just 1 helping of pain."}
