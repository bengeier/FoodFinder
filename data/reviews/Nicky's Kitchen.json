{"text":"Only giving 3 stars for the food it's decent but absolutely terrible customer service. They claim to open at 7am and we came at 9am and they weren't open it's not the first time they do this and all they did was stare at us and then pretend that we weren't there never bothered to come up and tell us that they weren't gonna open we waited for 20 minutes Very disrespectful so I decided to call and they just looked at the phone. There has been various times we go in and the waitress doesn't pay attention to us. The food is cheap and great but they take forever to make your order"}
{"text":"Great place for cheap eats! The place is very lackluster, nothing special other than a few regular tables and chairs. The customer service is average, but the food is good, and the prices are great! I've only ever had breakfast here, but it's good enough to come back for."}
{"text":"Nicky's gets four stars for their food. As far as appearance goes, this place is a hole in the wall (literally in between a dry cleaner and a weave store in the strip mall with bars over the windows) that hasn't been updated in ages and is a little on the dimly-lit side, but I look right past that. Owned by an old Greek couple, this place really falls into the mom & pop category- you can get a salad, burgers, gyro, BLT, seafood, bologna sandwich, even pork chops and country fried steak. They also have breakfast- pancakes, omelettes, country ham, corned beef hash, etc until 11:00 (I think). The food is great, and the prices are even better- lunch is usually under $5. I recommend the pita burger, cheeseburger (juicy fried patties with a soft bun that sops up the perfect amount of grease), or Nicky's Salad (which is HUGE for $5.75)."}
{"text":"I had a burger and fries with a soft drink.  Food and service was good, and the prices were cheap.  No refills on drinks, and despite the window signs, no fried chicken.  A mom-and-pop operation, but one that i will occasionally visit."}
{"text":"This is a great local family own diner. Fresh sit down breakfast. The family that owns it so nice. The breakfast is amazing especially after a long long night. I ordered a bacon, cheese, green pepper, and onion amazing omelette.  It comes with hashbrowns, and toast. I got grits just because I'm greedy.  The grits were so hot that they burn going down. To say the least i love this place and it is always good and you leave with that down home feel. The food was so good I forgot to take a pic.  That should say a lot"}
{"text":"The interior is very bare bones and simple. Don't let it deter you from coming in and enjoying the food!

Our server was friendly and the prices are beyond reasonable! Their Bog Breakfast special comes with eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, livermush, and your choice of hashbrowns or homefries and toast or a biscuit for $5.95!

Portions were great and the food was very good!"}
{"text":"If this was a chain restaurant, I'd probably give it a 1 or 2 but I try to support mom and pop's restaurants whenever I can so I'm being more lenient than normal. I was first a little caught off guard to pull up and find the windows of the restaurant and all the stores around it had bars on them and then felt rather neglected standing at the front of the restaurant and being ignored for 10 minutes. I had to actually go up to a waitress and ask if it was OK if my group of 9 put 2 tables together. It took another 10 minutes before anyone came to get our drink orders, another 10 to get our food orders and an hour for the food to come out. The food was good but average. The lack of service was what I found most irritating since there was almost no one else in the place. They also only serve breakfast on Saturdays and are open only to 1:30 p.m. It worked out fine for us but could be an issue for others. I will say though that the biggest redeeming quality is the prices. The cost is fantastically low (all 9 of us ate for around $50 total), especially for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is outstanding! Not to be mistaken by the appearance: food is at priced great and my breakfast sandwich had a heap of bacon. Looking forward to trying lunch here!"}
{"text":"I totally thought I did a review of this place.. guess not.. here goes nothing!

This place ROCKS!  It's definitely a bare bones, in a slightly questionable part of town.. but the food and price is hands down amazing.  Locally owned and operated. I hear the owner is nice. The chef does great things in the kitchen. The staff that i've met is great to the point where we've had in-depth conversations about life, goals and aspirations.. not just.. how's the weather small talk.  It's not rocket-science folks.. you should definitely try it.  There are daily specials. Breakfast, lunch, brunch are the key meals.  I ordered the feta greek omelet which was so tasty, that I ordered the same thing to go.  You get a lot of food- pretty much enough for 2 meals. The omelet comes with grits or home fries- i've had both here and recommend the grits. It also comes with biscuits or toast.. also had both.. and being in the South- you really have to go with the biscuits-- it's their specialty.. anything else is just unheard of!  

Great portion sizes!
Delicious food!
Friendly staff!
Great prices!
=
Win, win, win!

My only negative comment is that the hours are not posted.. i've come back several times and they weren't open yet. Also calling the line is a hit or miss.. I wish they had a voicemail recording or at least the ability to leave a message.  That is all folks!  Please try this place.. be open-minded about the location and decor.. and enjoy!  Your appetite will thank me later!"}
{"text":"No, they got rid of the gyro but just as good is the marinated chicken on their soft, pita bread."}
