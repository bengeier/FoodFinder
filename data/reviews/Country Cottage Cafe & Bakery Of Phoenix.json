{"text":"THIS RESTAURANT IS CLOSED AS OF 8/21/08.  Because of the great reviews, we drove here for lunch, and was informed that now they only serve \"High Tea\", and it is by reservation ONLY.  No other meals are served.  She explained that her business has become primarily catering, and so no longer opens to the public, except by reservation only, and only for \"high tea\"."}
{"text":"It's just plain fun to go there! The walls, the floor and tables are decorated and painted like if it were an outdoor set-up. The food is by far the best I've had out of all cafe's of this style! It's very clean, roomy with nice wide chairs (the ones outside are rocking chairs). Don't forget the delicious dessert!"}
{"text":"Folks here are very accommodating for folks who have particular needs (vegetarians, people with allergies, etc.).  The food here is NOT out of a can - it's made right there and is of very good quality.  There's a lunch buffet, salad bar, soups and sandwiches - not really a big variety to select from, but what they have is very fine.  

This place is in the back corner of the outlet mall just off the freeway."}
