{"text":"Great place in da Burgh! Took the whole family. Sushi, yellowtail collar, salmon udon, mmmmmmm. Stay away from the wings..... but a great place on a warm summer night. Love it!"}
{"text":"Adjusted for price, this is probably my least favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I only had two appetizers, and they both were bad and expensive. The \"new style sashimi\" was $14 for 5 thin slices of cooked fish. No where on the menu does it say it's cooked, and nothing in the history of the universe suggests sashimi is cooked. To boot, the staff tried to charge me $28 for this ungodly abomination. That was quickly taken care of, but nothing else was done in a timely manner. I wouldn't even recommend this place for drinks as service was slow and inattentive at the bar."}
{"text":"I usually just peruse Yelp but this place deserves a review. Great new spot for Pittsburgh. It was pretty busy on a Saturday night but not overflowing. We were able to sit at the bar no problem  Awesome decor- super cool fish tank as you walk in (look down!) and overall well decorated restaurant throughout. Two bar areas plus a sushi bar. There are booths which looked cool and seem to allow for some privacy   Rebecca served us at the bar and was extremely attentive and knowledgeable. A+ !!  Brussel sprout appetizer is amazing- must try!!! Steamed dumplings were VERY good as well and come with a uniquely delicious dipping sauce  My friend got risotto and raved about it. It is served with a mound of miso butter that is folded in tableside (barside in this case).   Dragon chicken was good too and super white tuna was very fresh, melt in your mouth sashimi.   Got a spicy tuna roll too- we were full but this was a let down, worth skipping next time  The menu is HUGE, which makes for a good excuse to come back soon."}
{"text":"Very confusing menu. We thought we ordered miso soup but we got brought miso corn patties (as if that was a thing). We thought we ordered surf and turf as an entree and it was a double order of sushi."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere for sure!!  First off our server could not have been more patient and he encouraged us to ask as many questions as needed.  He knew the answers as well.  There were four of us so we do sushi and shared a couple of \"entrees\".  The sushi was very good, thought flavors were nice and fresh.  The entrees were excellant except for the Ramen dish...rather bland.  The food was good...not the best...but the place is lively and unique for Pittsburgh.  I would return for the right event."}
{"text":"One star is for the cool decor.  Terrible food and just ok service.  We started with pork belly skewers and then had ramen and the 16oz ribeye.  The ramen noodles were over cooked and all clumpy.  The broth is too salty and strangely sour.  The soft boiled egg is so salty that it's inedible.  Worst ramen ever."}
{"text":"Food was not spectacular enough for the price we were charged. Staff was great. Sushi rolls were heavy on the rice. Spicy tuna roll had a SLIVER of tuna and a ton of rice. Cocktails were good. It's more of a scene than anything else. I'd stop in for drinks and maybe some appetizers, but no sushi."}
{"text":"Most reviewers were spot on.  Mixed bag.  Some items were fabulous (Cauliflower appetizer).  Some really bad (mushroom risotto), some bland (salmon) and some too salty (short ribs). Sushi was standard fare.  Fun atmosphere.  We left feeling that he restaurant would be good for cocktails and an app or two.  Not a destination dinner place.  Perhaps trying to do and be too much by mixing tapas, gastro and sushi?"}
{"text":"Got lunch here because the reviews looked good. I ordered fried rice with salmon. I could smell the salmon when they brought me the  bag but was hopeful everything would taste good. Got back to work....the salmon was spoiled. Called to advise what occurred and was told a manager would call me back because he stepped out. Needless to say NO call back. This was tge second time my food was not edible. I'll never go here or recommend any friends to go here"}
{"text":"Delish! We got the edamame hummus, brussels, sushi, and short rib noodles  Awesome environment."}
{"text":"This is by far the coolest new restaurant in Pittsburgh to date. The food (spicy crunchy tuna sushi roll, broccoli appetizer and chicken with hidden dragon sauce) decor and staff were tremendous at making my experience like none other.  I will DEFINITELY be becoming a regular there."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Variety of portion sizes and types of Asian food. Very quick service. Great new addition to downtown pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place is great. Really nice new vibe in Pittsburgh. The food fell waaaaay short. Sushi was ehh. But seaweed salad no way. Better at giant eagle, I have a hard time even typing that. Also got soup and it was like water and salt but mostly salt. But you should check it out the bar for happy hour with friends. The bar area is really fun!! Just avoid the food!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, had done research but didn't notice this place. I guess, because of the mediocre rating .  We walked by and were surprise on how beautiful this place was and that we didn't know about it.   We came back later for dinner and happy we found it , as not much was open for dinner on Sunday night.  We loved it !  Our waiter gave us great recommendations , we had the Kobe wontons , Duck dumplings , scallop pad Thai and Rock shrimp . Everything was delicious.  It is small plates,  if you're starving you would need to order more , but I thought the prices were reasonable for the quality .   Would happily come back ... even sorry that part of our party had left earlier in the day and missed it."}
{"text":"Pretty atmosphere and hip inside. Food was horrible. Everything was waaaaaay too salty and otherwise lacked general flavor. Drinks were fun and inventive. Go to drink and not to eat until they remedy."}
{"text":"Our meal was tasty, good sized, and shareable for two. I recommend the Brussel sprouts and Latin roll. We were stuffed on apps and ended up not ordering a full dinner. Service was fast, waiter was knowledgeable and friendly. Pricy but, felt like the dining experience was worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went and checked out Social house 3 times already ! Every time had an amazing experience from the staff to atmosphere! The food was hands down some of best food we have had dining in Pittsburgh! They have a really creative drink menu as well ! Highly recommend the drink that comes with a little flower that changes the taste of drink ! Anyone looking for a great new spot out to grab drinks or for date night social house is a must !"}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here and had the worst possible experience. Called in and they said 20min, so I got there 25min later and went up to grab my food. Sitting there 5, 10, 15min. Nothing. Overhear the hostess saying that they gave my order to someone else. No apology or anything. And as I was walking out, they stopped me to take out something from my bag that they placed by accident. Definitely needs to get themselves together. Doubt I will be going back."}
{"text":"Went to Social House Seven last night for a girls night out and had the BEST experience!  The food was amazing, drinks was great, the atmosphere is fun, decor is so cool... we felt like we were in an LA restaurant. This is definitely our new spot and I can't wait to go back next!"}
{"text":"Food and drink are wonderful, however the two times I have been there, there were some problems with the service. The first time was on a Tuesday night where the waiter was rushing us although it was no where near closing time and half the tables in the restaurant were empty. The second time was on a Saturday night where we had a later reservation.We were seated on the bar side of the restaurant, which then turned into a club while we were still trying to eat dinner. I looked at the other side of the restaurant and there were plenty of open tables and the kitchen was still open. I understand needing to seat people in order to balance out the server's workload. However, after a certain time you should not sit people on the side that will then turn into a club atmosphere while they are still dining. I really enjoy the food but struggle with the idea of coming back and spending the money since we've receive below par service twice now."}
{"text":"Great food.  Fantastic service but Courtney at the bar was exceptional.  Totally slammed but managed it all night."}
{"text":"We had dinner last evening (with friends) and were very disappointed with both the service and the food. The Robata section of the menu was not available, and they had no lettuce for their lettuce wraps. The edamame hummus plate was beyond disappointing, and the pad thai with chicken was very dry and tasteless. My dinner came out fairly quickly but all of the others in my party had to wait an extended period of time for their meals. We were given the excuse that all food is served family style and is brought to the table when it is ready. In my opinion, that just means they are not organized enough to present the food for each table in a timely manner. We wanted to eat together, but instead we had two separate meals. I hope they can turn things around, because it is a beautiful restaurant in a great location."}
{"text":"I was on a quick trip visiting a friend in PA a short time ago and stumbled upon Social House 7.  I really liked the design and atmosphere.  The hostess seated us in a timely manner (for having JUST walked in without reservations and for the business that night, it seemed we would have needed them). We really enjoyed the variety on the menu and the drink choices.  We ordered a few things from the Appetizers and then we split Short Rib Yaki Noodle AND the Spicy Tofu.  We thought the both dishes were delicious. Spices/flavors were perfect.  I live in a tourist destination where prices are always inflated, so these prices I felt were VERY REASONABLE. This is a great menu for sharing plates.  When I return to Pittsburgh, I'll be sure to return here. :)"}
{"text":"So many cool things about this restaurant. (Especially the koi fish under your feet right when you walk through the front doors.) Decided to check this spot out on one of my visits to Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is awesome, decor is amazing, and service was above par. Our server Ryan was so attentive and friendly and had many great recommendations. (-1 for it being too packed on a Friday evening when we were there, but hey, that could be a positive thing too right?)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here tonight. The decor and ambience is awesome. Our server, Lexi was super nice and explained how things worked very well. However, we were a little disappointed in the portion sizes of the food. Some things are over priced for what you get. We ordered the scallops first. Wow. It was hardly even half of one scallop that you got. The presentation was very pretty though. Based on that, we were just over it. Not sure if I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"We visited on Friday evening without reservation. Great atmosphere and decorations. Nice service. Just don't order the ramen. The noodle was overcooked and clumped. And the plate was flooded with broth. Too bad that the eggs submerged in the flooding broth were on point and delicious. Duck crepe and crab salad were just okay. Duck was dry and the crepe was more like a small pancake. Scallops and crunchy spicy tuna rolls were delicious."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of several people and tried at least 4 dishes, including my own which was sent back. The food is terrible. All that I tried either had no flavor or was overly salty. The service was also mediocre."}
{"text":"First of all, the restaurant is big and looks amazing. Unfortunately the cocktails and coconut soup I had was average."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight.  Service was very poor, and food marginal.  Cost of drinks was excessive, and the pour was only one ounce for $13.50.  Management was indifferent about the experience.  I would skip this hole in the wall as there are many other better restaurants in the area for better value."}
{"text":"The food here was spectacular. Such a cool environment and the romanesco is a must have. Great place for vegetarians as well."}
{"text":"Bought last minute tickets for a show at the Benedum on Friday night and came downtown to the cultural district with no dinner reservations around 6:15. Originally went to proper brick oven and tap room, but after hearing that the wait was 1 hr 15 minutes, hightailed it out of there. Social House Seven was right next door and very close walking distance to the Benedum. We were told that the wait for a table would be 2 hrs but that we could get full service at the bar. There is one larger bar to the left and a smaller bar with about 8-10 seats to the right when you walk in. There was plenty of room at the smaller bar and we snagged two seats and were promptly given menus. The bartender explained that the food  comes out as it is ready, and she wasn't joking. Our first sushi roll came out approximately 5-10 minutes after ordering it. We ordered the wok charred rice cakes, scallop pad Thai, snow crab Cali roll, crunchy spicy tuna roll, and the chicken tempura roll. Everything was amazing. Great sushi, and the rice cakes were so different and delicious, almost like \"Asian gnocchi\" with a proportionate amount of crisp and chew. Portions were pretty good. Pad Thai was very flavorful, slightly sweet and with lime zest throughout, which was unique. Cool decor and vibe, good service. We were finished with our meal and out the door in plenty of time to make our show. Reservations can be made on Open Table. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dinner was very good! Took my wife here for Valentines Day. I thought it would be packed but it was good to go early as it was very light crowd. The special prix fixe menu was pricey but the regular menu was very reasonable. We shared the scallop Pad Thai, grilled shrimp skewers, Alaskan roll and Latin roll. Our food came out quickly, presented very well and the staff were very attentive. Latin roll was quite unique! Would definitely go back again. Only took a star off for their tea not being anything to write home about, which I tend to expect from a good Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"Sashimi isn't as fresh as it should be and was extremely fishy tasting. I actually didn't even finish it. Sushi was ok, nothing to write home about. Cocktails are decent. Music is good. Atmosphere is ok. Layout of the restaurant is a bit odd. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Over sauced, over cooked, over salted: But I'll start positively. Drinks and atmosphere are super fun. Everyone loves the fish tank floor and the art/decor is awesome. Ate here twice and sampled a ton of food off the menu. From the vegetarian sushi, to edamame, the broccoli appetizer and the soba noodle salad, I just wasn't that thrilled. Typically when I go for Japanese or sushi I'm thinking light, fresh and healthy. This is Asian food (all sorts) that's been heavily Americanized. Don't get me wrong, it tastes pretty good, but most things are deep fried or completely smothered in sauce. Nothing on the menu had that light, airy feel I am used to when I go for sushi. Even the vegetarian sushi roll came smothered in a white aioli type sauce that I don't believe is mentioned on the menu description. I recommend going to try out their unique cocktail menu and having dinner elsewhere unless you're prepared for something a bit heavier."}
{"text":"Social House has some real potential, but somethings are missing the mark. The atmosphere is cool, but the main lanterns in the dinning room are too bright. They distract your eye away from the rest of the of things going on here. Putting these on a dimmer would make a huge difference in my opinion.  They are also trying to push a different dinning experience that's more of a constant ordering of small plates to share with your group, but the wait staff isn't educated enough on how to explain this and how it works. In addition there's nothing on the menu that explains what it is your getting. For example the $14 monkfish skewers are way over priced as the portion is extremely small, barely enough for one, let alone share. On the flip side the $15 Bi Bim Bop is a huge bowl that makes a great entree size, but doesn't share easy. The menu needs to be simplified and provide better training to their staff to make it easier to understand what your ordering.  Because your supposed to be constantly ordering small shareable dishes, the wait staff will constantly be stopping by your table, interrupting your conversations and in my opinion distracts from the experience. In addition this process bings a lot of plates to your table that unless your a party of two sitting at a table for 4, you quickly run out of table real estate and again, distracts from the experience.  I'm glad that more places like this are coming to the downtown area and I'm sure they will be getting better over time as the other restaurants this group owns are great. I'd wait 3 or 4 months for them to work thru these issues and fine tune the experience they're trying to achieve. If your looking for a great experience in downtown Pittsburgh, I'd recommend a Meat & Potatoes or Täk? first. If it's Asian Cuisine your after, as bad as it is to say, I'd go to P.F. Chang's. If you have to go to Social House now, then id recommend you sit in the bar area away from the bright lanterns and stick with the sushi rolls as that pretty straight forward and know what to expect.  I hope to try social House again, but it won't be anytime soon"}
{"text":"Not including the sushi, the food here is reminiscent of microwavable items you can buy at Trader Joes.   The dumplings were small and generic, wings were under-seasoned/bland, miso soup was overwhelmingly miso-y (way too much miso added, extremely salty), the kani salad consisted primarily of curled cucumbers soaked in mayo dressing w/ 3 pieces of crab meat, the seaweed salad was fine/typical but the portion was too small, the pork belly skewers had excessive sauce and breading on them which was too heavy to stomach. The sushi was fine, nothing to rave about our complain about.   On top of all this the dishes are overpriced. It's a shame to pay so much for food that you can buy pre-made/frozen and heat up yourself.  I do not recommend coming to Social for dinner, particularly do not bring guests. Happy hour + sushi will be your best bet."}
{"text":"Outstanding service.  Food and portion size were perfect. Atmosphere was great. Reminded me of Buddakhan in Philly.  A definite must go again!!"}
{"text":"Ambience and environment is nice. Quality of food is nothing to rave about. Average at best. Overpriced. Drinks are good. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere and good food Sushi, but also other options that makes it easy to take non sushi eaters as well. We ordered a little of everything and ate family style. For a unique Pittsburgh experience I recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for dinner and we spent New Years here last year.  The New Years party they had here was awesome.  They had free sushi, which they passed around on platters.  They also offered bottle service and opened up the main dinner area as a dance for. As for dinner, it's always really good.  I've had the sushi here and it's just as good as any other spot in Pittsburgh.  I also had the lamb chops, this was my favorite dish here by far.  The coconut fried rice is pretty good too and it's a bargain at $8 imo.  Sushi: 9/10 Lamb Chops: 9/10 Coconut Fried Rice: 8/10"}
{"text":"I went to Social House 7 with a couple of my friends last week. Our waitress, Mar, was super friendly (super!) and she was very helpful and informative about all of the menu items. Our party just ordered things off of the menu to share. We got the edamame, shishito peppers, and the volcano roll. Then individually, my one friend got the scallops, my other friend got the Brussels salad, and I ordered the spicy Kani salad and curried chicken soup. The food came out quickly and was plated nicely. Everything we tried was delicious! When my soup came out, I could tell from the smell that I was not going to like it. But I decided to taste it just in case. After tasting the soup, I definitely confirmed that I didn't like it. I set the soup off to the side and enjoyed the other snacks on the table. Mar came up to me and noticed that I didn't eat the soup and asked if I didn't like it. I told her I thought it was going to be something different and no, I did not like the soup. (I had planned to pay for it because o ordered it-- it's not the restaurants fault I didn't like it). She told me she would take it off the bill and asked if I would like to try the miso soup instead. I was stuffed from our other food so I declined, but her customer service alone makes for my 5 star rating. I liked the atmosphere and the customer service at Social House -- and the food also of course-- I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came to Social House Seven for drinks after getting dinner on a Friday night. The inside was nothing like what I was expecting but I was pretty happy with the whole vibe.   There were two bars, very large and one small. Both were full and we were lucky enough to find two seats at the smaller bar. The workers all seemed pleasant and it was definitely a good place to go and have a drink.   The place filled up quickly and all of the food smelled amazing. I will definitely put it on my list of places to try and review again based on food."}
{"text":"Nice decor but skimpy on the fish. My Alaska roll was 90% rice. The salmon was paper thin like we were under some government mandated rationing program. I will not return, which is a shame as there aren't many quality restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Great seafood choices, but I prefer beef. Was very happy with the Korean Cheesesteak sandwich and the crispy Brussels sprouts! Great service!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The portions are very small, the service was terrible and the tables are crooked. They claim to be an upper class restaurant, they are nothing more then a nakama without hibachi."}
{"text":"Very pricy. But the food is amazing and the service is extraordinary. The location encourages sharing food, therefore there are plates for sharing. The water is in a glass bottle which our server poured each time we needed refills. The sushi is delicious and affordable. The appetizers are great but expensive. The staff is very knowledgeable and great at explaining the menu and what everything is and how it tastes. The house draft is also delicious. The atmosphere is calming and soothing. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious food & surprisingly reasonable prices for downtown! Our server David (pronounced Da-veed) made excellent wine & food suggestions."}
{"text":"I just ordered the 16 oz bone in ribeye and this is what arrived.   No steak, no bone, precut and no silverware. When I questioned my meal, the bartender thinking they brought me the 8 oz Wagyu by mistake took my plate and went back to the kitchen to check. By the time they took it back and forth to figure it out they returned it ice cold and said that they removed the bone for me. Cold Waygu or Cold ribeye either way equals crap food and a greasy tongue.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"The best part of this place was the decor. Very swanky and cool.   Otherwise the food was extremely hit or miss. Tuna tartar was fantastic. Sea bass was reasonably good. Everything else was mediocre at best. Every vegetable in the place appeared to be fried - I didn't realize you could ruin broccoli like that. I had to send back the miso soup because it was inedible. Miso soup - that is hard to ruin.   Service was friendly, but distracted. Bar was very slow. We got our second round of drinks well after we were done eating (to their credit, however, the server comped these drinks).   This place would be great if they upped the quality of raw ingredients, had a much lighter hand on seasoning, and did some more staff training to work out the kinks."}
{"text":"We went here because everywhere else was booked up on a Saturday night. We first ordered the broccoli and the pork dumplings for appetizers. They were all right, not amazing but still good. For entrées, we ordered the Bibimbap and the scallop pad Thai. The Bibimbap came with rice that was still crunchy because it was so undercooked. The scallop pad Thai was underwhelming - way over cooked scallops, atop a noodle dish that vaguely resembled pad Thai and tasted completely bland. To serve that and charge $20 is crazy. Our server was nice and made up for it by comping the Bibimbap which was appreciated. I didn't go in expecting anything mind blowing but was disappointed in the quality for the price."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place today since I've never had their sushi. I would definitely say find another place. The salmon and avocado roll for example, has a piece of salmon inside of it the size of a nickel and the rice around it is larger than a golf ball. Very disproportionate fish to rice ratio especially considering the price of each one of these rolls. Probably won't waste my money there again."}
{"text":"The build out of this restaurant is very impressive, every little square inch of the restaurant has been upgraded and has a wow factor when you first enter. We did not have a reservation so I understand not giving us a table, but there were sooooo many open tables when we came in around 6:30. They said they could give us one but that we would have to leave by 8:00 since there were reservations for those tables then so we opted to sit at the sushi bar instead. There were three of us and we were sharing dishes so sitting three across at a sushi bar was a little awkward, but the food was very good. We mainly had sushi rolls and a few apps, but overall I liked everything we had. Also tried a few cocktails which were very good as well. Definitely a place to try again!"}
{"text":"First of all Kizzy must be your waiter! He is amazing. That said, we were given two menus. One for Valentine's Day and one regular menu. We didn't want the prefix dinner but Kizzie pulled a couple strings and was able to get us one of the appetizers: foie gras bao buns. It was like I had died and gone to heaven. They must must must make this a regular menu item! Next came the spider roll, fire grilled scallop, and duck crepes. It was way too much food for two women, but we gave it our best shot! I promise, if foie gras bao buns are on the menu, I will definitely be there two days a week, minimum.  And they are open for lunch too....o"}
{"text":"This restaurant is huge and the decor is fabulous, especially the live fish underneath the doorway right as you walk in. I came here for lunch and was very pleasantly surprised after reading the mixed reviews, but the food we ordered was great!  My friend and I shared the poke sushi burrito and the bibimbap. Both were so flavorful and well-prepared. Flavors were bold and balanced. The waiter mentioned that all the dishes are meant to be shared. While the burrito was easily shareable among two people, the bibimbap bowl was difficult to split, mainly because it was a rice bowl. While I didn't mind this, I'm not sure if \"shareable dishes\" was 100% accurate for all menu items. I can get over this, though. Next time, I probably won't share!  For lunch, Social House Seven was empty. I'd be curious to see if it livens up for dinner service. Looks like I'll have to find out!"}
{"text":"Amazing Asian fusion food! The ambiance was incredible!!  Love the mix of Thai-Chinese-Japanese  The Brussels sprouts are to die for, sushi is on par with Nakama but not as good as Little Toyko(lebo), the ginger fried rice blows the saga type places out of the water!! Their signature cocktails are honestly amazing. Pair perfectly with each dish and are not too sweet or too strong. The service was on par. Young wait staff...mostly in their 20s so it had an upbeat feel. We also had the scallop and the pork skewers. The scallop had AMA I got flavor but a small serving only 3 slices...the pork skewers were great and the serving was plenty big! Very unique flavor served on cucumber slices w a great sauce. The spicy tuna roll did have a better flavor than other places but the tightness of the roll and the ratio of filling to rice was a tad off!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3 stars for now, because I haven't eaten here and feel like that would be a large chunk of the review. I came here for a few drinks on a Friday night. It was pretty busy, but it didn't look like there was an insane wait for people wanting to eat. The drink selection was pretty decent, and the prices were pretty standard for a place downtown.  The decor is super trendy, but I can see where someone would think it might a little overwhelming. There is a coy pond when you walk in, so that was cool but also weird. There were two bars, which is a nice touch because they were both pretty busy by the time we left.The food smelled really good - I would definitely come back to try it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Good drink selection.  Sushi was pretty good.  Our server was only downside.  Very non attentive and overall bad.  Waited way too long for drinks and checked on us very infrequently."}
{"text":"SUCH good food. Our waiter was very attentive and even brought us some sake to try. The food was the best thai food I have ever had. I recommend the coconut chicken rice."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but if you appreciate Asian food then you will not like this place.   We ordered a to-go order of dumplings, bibimbap, spicy tuna roll, California roll, and rainbow roll.    All of the sushi was bad to the point that we physically spit it out.  The avocado in the California and rainbow roll was rotting, brown, and had an awful taste.  The spicy tuna roll was just sliced tuna with scallion in a roll with spicy mayo sauce on top, definitely not a spicy tuna roll by any means.  The rice on all of the rolls was hard and barely chewable.  The maki rolls were sloppily rolled and put together.   The dumplings had very little taste, they tasted like completely bland mush.  The bibimbap was the only thing we could finish and eat and even that was below par.  Being Korean I've had my fair share of bibimbap, and its kind of hard to mess up.  Firstly, they charge $16 for plus whatever tip and tax you pay, it is definitely not worth it for this dish.  The rice, once again, was under cooked.  There was barely enough spicy sauce and none of the toppings stood out in this dish.  The beef was overly chewy to the point where you had to spit it out.    I usually give restaurants a second chance because the first time could have been a fluke.  But the fact of the matter is every single dish we got was disgusting. (how do you have undercooked rice in an Asian establishment!!???)  I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but it was a huge let down. The atmoshpere was great and the drinks were fine but other than that I was disappointed. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't good either. We got the shirt rib yaki noodles which were okay, the chicken with hidden dragon sauce (I think the only ingredient they used was salt), the corn robata which wasn't bad just very bland with no flavor and pork belly skewers which also had no taste unless you count the hair we found on it.  A waitress who wasn't ours also came around and spilled water all over the table and the short rib noodles. All of this for $84, which I wouldn't mind paying if it had been a good meal. Panda Express may have been a better option."}
{"text":"Social house ramen. Bowl of nope in an expensive space with an annoying trap soundtrack. Pork (all of it) tastes like it's been in that fridge for a while. Who puts spinach in ramen?"}
{"text":"We were super excited to try this place...and the excitement stopped pretty much right after we were seated.  The space is definitely impressive. We had one waitress come over to explain the  concept and take our drink order but because the music was so loud I only caught a couple things she said.  We ordered drinks and then 2 more waitresses came over to take our orders.  There was definitely some confusion, but that's excusable because it was opening weekend.  My $18 Manhattan was a little weak.  We ordered the duck crepes, pork belly, pork dumplings, kobe wonton, yellowtail and tuna sashimi, spider roll, and salmon sashimi appetiizer.  The only dish that I would even consider ordering again is the duck crepes.  Everything else lacked flavor, the sushi was subpar at best.  I've had better at small local places.  Our salmon sashimi never came so I can't comment on that.  However the mango on top of the yellowtail just ruined the fish for me and we ordered tuna sashimi too and I don't know what came out but it definitely wasn't tuna.  There is potential here, however the food, while creative needs to be refined.  If we want sushi, we'll go to Umami."}
{"text":"Social House Seven had a nice decor/atmosphere, interesting food options, and ok service. My husband and I had an early dinner there last night before the baseball game.   We ordered four items to share: CHEE CHEE FRIED BRUSSEL SPROUTS, CRISPY ROCK SHRIMP, WOK CHARRED RICE CAKES, and MONKFISH SKEWERS. The brussels sprouts were delicious and the shrimp were pretty tasty. We did not like the rice cakes - they were such a weird, chewy texture. We tried to eat some as leftovers today and they had become really hard and inedible. The monkfish was just sort of bland. I also enjoyed a SAKE BOAT cocktail, which was great, though I wish I had known about their happy hour specials (I just now saw them on the website).  Our server was nice but seemed inexperienced. Another server came by and cleared one of our plates before I was finished with it, without asking, which was irritating.  I may try this place again, but it wouldn't be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"I went for the first time last night and it was a little different than what I expected but that's not a bad thing.  Loved the design and the fish tank in the floor of the door way. It was an interesting design.  I had to try the pop rocks sushi and while I don't normally like asparagus I loved this. The flavor combination was interesting and the texture of the pop rocks with the flavor mix made this something different than anything I've ever had.  I liked pretty much everything else, the coconut fried rice and chicken were both among the better items I had.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the shrimp skewers. I wasn't a big fan of the marinade they were in but considering everything else was good it's a place I'd be willing to go back to."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night before a show at the Benedum. I ordered sushi and asparagus and my husband ordered ramen and shishito peppers.   The ramen smelled weird and tasted weird. My husband was very disappointed and is now so turned off from ramen.   We were warned that the food would come out at different times because they have three different kitchens. I believe it was sushi, grill and regular kitchen.   My asparagus came out with the check. We had to ask for it and our waiter assured us it was coming. It was cold when it arrives and then our waiter just kind of ignored us for a while. Maybe out of embarrassment for the asparagus but we had to get to our show.  We mentioned our Benedum season tickets which should get us 15% off at Social House 7 and our waiter said we needed a coupon. Which is incorrect. There's no coupon."}
{"text":"We arrived after 7 pm so the place was noisy and busy - to be expected.  We were seated right away and the menu was given to us right away.  The choices might have been great for someone who was familiar with Japanese cuisine but to those of us who are not, it was a bit bewildering. However, I did order the spicy egg rolls and a glass of wine.  My husband ordered the salmon sushi roll and sake.  He was disappointed that the salmon was not a piece of salmon but more like salmon which had been ground up, like hamburger. My rolls have a good flavor but were very chewy.  When we left and the waiter brought back the bill w/card for us to sign he just 'flew' by us and threw the bill holder at the table.  It promptly fell on the floor, dumping the contents and the waiter just kept on going.  Needless to say this was very disconcerting and if I have been in charge of signing the bill, no tip would have been given.  Especially since we really did not have much 'wait service' from the staff. Since we don't live in Pittsburgh we will never visit this place again and if we did live here we would not visit this place again nor would we recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visits there. My salmon dinner was excellent. My roommate did not enjoy his steak dinner but it looked good. The service is great and friendly which is the most important aspect of dining out for me. I am not into sushi but people around me seemed to enjoy it. It is a bit expensive but what isn't anymore. I particularly liked the huge open windows  that allowed one to enjoy the outside air. The décor is dark, eclectic and relaxing.  I enjoyed my wine and will return again."}
{"text":"The portions are EXTREMELY SMALL for sharing portions and ridiculously expensive. The portions is barely big enough for a snack. The food was good, but not worth the price. Will not be going back"}
{"text":"To sum it up: Good, but pricey and loud.   Came by around 8 on a Friday night for a drink and some food. We weren't sure if we would have dinner here or just some snacks -- we ended up sharing two plates which was dinner for me and snacks for my fiance -- due to the disparity in our appetites. We each tried one of the Japanese beers on tap. Tasty, but probably what would be considered a coors light in Japan and overpriced for a light pilsner.   We shared the spicy tuna roll and the fried brussel sprouts. Both were really tasty and a good compliment to one another. I really enjoyed both dishes but I will always believe that $10 is steep for brussell sprouts.  Another thing to note is there is kind of a party atmosphere. We sat at a window seat facing the street but a guy at a table with a party of about 8 behind us was SCREAMING non-stop and really disruptive. I wouldn't head here for a quiet, romantic meal.   Overall I liked it, but when I want to really splurge going out I have to LOVE it. There are just too many options for good Asian food in town to justify spending $40 before tip on two beers and two appetizers."}
{"text":"Another AMPD Group location, another great spot. AMPD Group concepts always end up being very well executed.  Great atmosphere with a nice drink selection. The staff was friendly and the food was tasty.  The fortune cookie desert was amazing!  Great new addition to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Ugh. I have been dying to eat at Social House ever since it opened & I was hoping I liked it better than I did. For now, it's pretty much a solid 3 star. I've gone a few times at night for drinks, but had dinner reservations on a Friday night for 8 of us. It was a great place to go with a large group. I will start by saying that the atmosphere is literally amazing inside of Social House. The interior and vibe inside basically account for the 3 stars I have given it. Like a lot of other reviewers have said, it reminds me of a swanky NYC restaurant. It really is stunning!  The service was just OK- nothing extravagant about it but nothing wrong with it. Everything seemed to take a little longer than it should have, which was fine since we were there to catch up with each other anyways. Because it did take a little while to be served, we ended up ordering our drinks and food at the same time. My friend and I started with the Ki King Broccoli as an app. This broccoli was so good and very unique from anything I've ever had! It was tempura fried and had some kind of sesame sauce. For dinner, everyone at the table ordered sushi rolls. They had a lot of options but the Volcano roll caught my eyes pretty quickly! Others at the table got the California Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Godzilla Roll. Our waiter brought the sushi rolls out at all different times, which I thought was kind of weird.  As far as the sushi goes... nothing special. Everyone at the table agreed that we have had much better sushi (and for cheaper!)   As far as Social House goes, I would say that you are for sure paying for the atmosphere and experience of this restaurant. It's a great addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene, just wish the food wowed me a little bit more!"}
{"text":"Awful service and management, complete clusterfuck, if you asked for the worst service ever they couldn't even do that. Apparently it's a \"tappas\" place because we basically never got our appetizers and 2 out of the 3 meals"}
{"text":"David the Frenchman was a wonderful server! Suggested a salmon sushi roll. It was one of the best rolls I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"This place has a fantastic modern, Asian-inspired atmosphere that's pretty unique, especially for Pittsburgh. The menu has a lot of interesting Asian fusion dishes (Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Korean), and all the ones I tried were really good! Some portions are small for the price, but they recommend ordering tapas-style to share.   The fortune cookie dessert was SO GOOD. Huuuuge dark chocolate covered fortune cookie filled with mousse, not too sweet and big enough to share. Hands down the perfect way to end that meal"}
{"text":"We did not have a reservation on a Friday night and had a cool booth with dim lighting.  Super praise to whomever chose the lighting.  From the pleasant servers; to the seating (plenty of seating areas that offer privacy or an ability to just focus on your companions and not hearing other's conversations); food (sushi, pad thai, chilean sea bass, desserts, lobster spring rolls;) to the cleanliness everywhere, this is a very good restaurant.  I am not accustomed to how they serve their pad thai but the next day it was way better.  Ordered mine with shrimp and the kitchen was very generous.   Their seafood entree's, sushi, drinks and appetizers were great."}
{"text":"great food. great drinks.  on par service.  would definitely recommend and will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"I visited this location on a Saturday night for a few adult beverages. It attracts a higher class and nice looking crowd. Drinks are priced as expected for a trendy upscale spot. I hear mixed reviews about the menu. I will defiantly visit again."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Go somewhere else. The drinks and food are overpriced and the service was terrible. I ordered a drink and my server never returned with it, but changed me for it. We never saw the server again. Tried speaking to the manger about the terrible service we were receiving and he walked away mid sentence."}
{"text":"Really really disappointing! My food was takeaway. I had sea bass / pumpkin / broth / whatever. My dish was missing snow peas, squash, broth, and any kind of coconut. It was like they put half an entree in the bag. If I was eating there I would have sent it back, I called to complain and they said they would take the entree off the tab. We'll see. Honestly I wish I would have had a properly cooked meal like the menu shows. It's like the idiot kitchen staff didn't care because they knew it wouldn't be coming back. The head chef should be fired for letting food like that out the door. Take pride in your food!  Two thumbs AND two big toes down. Now to scrounge up some crackers or cheese or something....."}
{"text":"Inexperienced server.  Ordered regular vodka martini, came as dirty.  Appetizers were great, pad Thai entree as well.  Ordered 3 Robata grill entrees:  scallops weren't even seared, completely raw, monkfish great taste but was completely cold, sat too long before serving, wings good flavor but undercooked as well.  Manager removed all these items from bill. Just wasn't a very good experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Went there for happy hour and they have some of the best appetizers I have had yet. Cheese kurds and chicken wings are a must. They also have this amazing drink called kung fu punch you cant go wrong. The staff was great. The ambience was even better. Such a cool restaurant  It even turns into a club after hours. A must see!"}
{"text":"Overall, I'd say this place was good. Not amazing, not bad, but \"good.\" We came here for Pittsburgh Restaurant week on a snowy Tuesday night.  The Good... * The Brussel Sprouts were AMAZING and def lived up to the hype! * The Taiwanese pork melted in your mouth and absolutely amazing! But apparently it was supposed to come with a Brussel sprout salad which was missing (and we did say anything cuz, well, I didn't remember it was supposed to be here until now). * Our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and offered helpful suggestions.  The Bad... * It took a legit 20 minutes for our dessert. And that's what we timed...meaning we had been waiting much longer than that. While the Mississippi Mud Pies were delicious, I don't understand why it took so long. * The pork bao was lacking. Granted this is the first time I've ever tried one, but it was lacking.   The Ugly... * The place smelled funky. Like, \"this stench is gonna stick on your clothes and body for at least a day\" funky. It's not the hibachi table smell...and I dunno what it is, but it's funky. In a BAD way. Like a really bad way.  While I'd like to try more of the menu since some parts of our meal were amazing (and we admittedly didn't order much), I don't know if I will due to the stench. Caution: Don't go there in dry clean only clothes cuz you're gonna STANK!"}
{"text":"Snow crab cali roll, unagi, chicken curry coconut soup and a Sapporo for under $30 during happy hour. Great good and great price"}
{"text":"Friday night out on the town.  I made reservations a few months in advance because we were seeing a show.  Then I tried to change them and they were booked up.  I am not going to review sushi.  It is sushi.  It is good and a spicy tuna roll will be a spicy tuna roll where ever you go (usually).  However, they do have some specialty rolls that are intriguing.  We were drawn to the Pop Rocks.  Yes, folks, real pop rocks candy.  The roll actually \"pops\" when it is brought to your table and in your mouth.     My real review is about service.  Our server was awesome.  He was thoughtful, personable and himself.  He wasn't trying to sell us, but just making a comfortable situation where the food might be a little uncomfortable.  He told us food comes out when ready so eating in rounds is the way to do it, and he was timely with drinks and check ups.  Alex (AKA Kissee) is the man.  We had a mis communication on leaving a cash tip so we had to go back to give him the money and we got actual hugs. Actual hugs, you can't buy that."}
{"text":"So close yet so very far. The ambience is very nice, if a little loud. The food was all hit or miss. Some sushi rolls were an incomprehensible rice mesh while others were decent. The ramen was lacking in spice and flavor. The soshito peppers were good. They ran out of the dessert we ordered after they gave a strong recommendation. The bartenders and staff were all pleasant but not very competent. While we were at the bar and I ordered their signature drink, I saw a confused scramble for the correct ingredients along with frequent consulting of a sheet of paper with the recipe. This did not inspire confidence. Neither did the fact that dishes were frequently handed to the wrong people and getting the checks split right took multiple attempts.   The one plus is the bartender gave a neat little Szechuan button which was fun on the tastebuds."}
{"text":"Whenever I first went there back in May when it was relatively new, I thought it was amazing and easily one of the best restaurants in pittsburgh. Each time I have returned I thought the quality of the food has gone downhill and the portions have gotten smaller. For example the robata scallops the first time I got it, I got 6, tonight I got 4. The chicken with the hidden dragon sauce, nowhere near as good. This is a classic example of the AMPD group. They start out strong but slowly go down the drain. Steel cactus is another example, started out amazing, now both locations are sub par. AMPD makes their money and then just doesn't care. If you want Asian cuisine, stick to your jimmy wans or your little tokoyos of pittsburgh. One thing I will say, the ambiance is great there. If I could rate it a 2.5 I would but I rounded up."}
{"text":"We came here after a mid afternoon show at the Benedum.  First impressions are the place looks absolutely lovely.  Lots of details to the wide open space.  And wide open indeed with a garage door style window in the front behind the bar.  Now we only had drinks so I can only really comment on that experience.  There was one other patron at the bar when we sat down.  We were greeted quickly and given drink menus.  The drink, for us, beer prices were about standard for downtown.  Between $6-$8 for most.  Some were really high at $10.00.  We ordered quickly and asked for menus, but the bartender never brought them.  Vigilant I sent my other half to track down a menu so I could peruse it while we imbibed.   Though we didn't order anything I saw several things that I would be excited to try.  I am hoping we have a chance to come back soon and really get the overall experience.  But for now it's an A-okay place to enjoy an afternoon pint."}
{"text":"I feel like this place is a solid 3.5 stars, but since nothing really jumped out and made me want to round up I'm going with 3. This is another Amp'd restaurant (Ten Penny, Steel Cactus, Local) and this very much fits in with the rest of their portfolio. In my opinion, they always absolutely nail the atmosphere and Social House 7 does not disappoint in that aspect! It's totally beautiful inside. I was kind of blown away at first - you walk in over a koi tank and when you enter the actual restaurant it's Asian-inspired and swanky. Totally stunning.  I was with a group of girls and our server explained that the menu was sort of an Asian Tapas style, which lends itself well to lots of sharing. I would never come here with my boyfriend... as he's not down with that :) but the style of this place makes it perfect for a girls night. We decided to go with some sushi, a bunch of appetizers, and some robata. Everything was okay, but nothing was super memorable one way or another. I was expecting to be blown away by the food but wasn't in love with anything that I tried.  We all tried the drink on special, which involved Midori and dry ice. The drink itself isn't something I would order more than one of - it was pretty sweet - but having one was totally enjoyable and the presentation was awesome.  Would I go back? Yes! I would really like to go back with some girlfriends and explore more menu items. Also, I want to make a later reservation and stick around, as the place turns into a club after a certain point. We didn't get to stay as we had other plans.  All in all, my experience at Social House 7 was pretty good but I definitely think it has all the potential in the world! I'll definitely check it out again."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Toni on this one with the three star rating.  I love the concept, but it just wasn't all there and I think there are far better sushi/Asian fusion restaurants in Pittsburgh.  My recommendation would be to come here before or after dinner, but not actually for dinner.  Unless you're doing apps and drinks - their apps are good.  A group of us girls had reservations last Friday for 8:45 and we didn't end up arriving until around 9.  We were quickly seated and a few minutes later our server stopped by.  He was nice, knowledgeable and patient with our group.  We decided to order our drinks and appetizers/meals at the same time so that we didn't have to keep stopping our conversation.  I ordered an extra dirty martini and while the flavor was there, it had ice throughout it and I thought that was a little odd.  Other girls enjoyed their craft cocktails. Someone ordered the broccoli appetizer and was nice enough to let us try - it was excellent.    One of my girlfriends and I split three rolls. We did the volcano roll, spicy tuna roll and Philadelphia roll.  I don't think there was anything at the table that anyone absolutely didn't enjoy.  I enjoyed the sushi and the fish tasted fresh, however the fish to rice ratio was way off.  Tiny portions of fish were in these large, rice-y rolls.  Flavor was good, but as I mentioned, I think there is definitely better sushi flavor-wise and texture-wise in the Burgh...especially for what Social charges.   You are paying for the atmosphere, which is trendy and modern.  It is a great place for a happy hour or drinks.  Both times I have been here it's been absolutely packed, but have never had an issue getting a drink.  The restrooms are clean and the place itself is spacious.  I anticipate I will be back time and time again to Social because it's a unique setting for Pittsburgh, but I cant say I would come racing back for dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place! I enjoyed their Japanese cuisine in a very chic atmosphere. However, the turn around time to receive our food was very long which is way I didn't give them all five stars. But if you're in no rush and have the time I would recommend trying out this spot...especially for drinks and appetizers. This was my third time here and I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Take a step inside and look beneath your feet; There are elegant koi fish swimming there, separated only by a sheet of thick glass. If this gives you any idea, this is the type of posh ambience you're in store for when eating at Social House. From the giant sculpted dieties above the luxe dining booths to the unnecessarily chic bathrooms, everything in the place reads  \"Exotic Foods and Expensive Cocktails\".  Our waiter was either the chef also or had once BEEN a chef, because he made us recommendations and spoke knowledgeably of the menu items with such a thick French accent that I picked it up after appetizers (which my friend made fun of me for, justifiably). We both ordered apps and shared. He ordered the Duck Crèpe (read with a French accent). We both really enjoyed it. I love a good Confit. I ordered the Breakfast of Champions on Chef Waiter's request. Bacon wrapped Quail Egg with Wasabi Maple Glaze= Glorious. I liked the daikon potato salad, but the crisp texture didn't win my pal over. Then came the sushi. As is tradition for me, I order the most gimmicky sushi roll on the menu. Pop Rocks roll is exactly what it sounds like: Sushi + Pop Rocks. It had shrimp, asparagus, and avocado inside with crab stick, tobiko, and a spicy aioli sauce on top. The texture contrast and popping sensation made this the most unique and unexpectedly awesome roll I've eaten in ages! I can't recommend it enough! We shared sushi rolls too, and he got the Godzilla roll: Scottish Salmon, Cream Cheese, and Scallion topped with seared spicy tuna, seaweed salad, tobiko, spicy aioli and house teriyaki. I was especially into the seaweed salad, and the roll as a whole was quite good. Overall, it was a cool dining experience. I only knocked off a star because the majority of the staff barely acknowledged us and could have helped out instead of letting Chef Waiter run around like crazy doing everything. It was 3 pm on a Wednesday and pretty dead... But possibly they were too busy discussing their favorite style of Abercrombie and Fitch tee. The swanky atmosphere usually isn't up my alley, but this was alright. It was like if Victoria Beckham decided to open a sushi restaurant instead of doing a clothing line.  Still, I'll probably go back during lunch to try their sushiritos. I will go hard on a good sushirito!"}
{"text":"Wow, talk about the most disappointing meal my fiancé and I have had in the last year. We went for a late valentines dinner and for $110 our meals were awful. The drinks sucked. We love Asian food and this was NOT worth what you're paying. The only thing that saved the night for us were the pork dumplings. Those were amazing. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went this past Friday and loved it. Our waitress was very nice and helpful with the menu. I got the coconut mule and it was delicious. We LOVED the brussels sprout app (drooling just thinking about them). The sushi was good. There was a DJ who played great songs too but I could see why people say it's too loud. Cool environment/interior. A little pricey. Will return!"}
{"text":"Cool place and the food is really good, but the service is horrible.  Came here with my friend last week on my co-workers recommendation. The server seemed nice at first, but came off as pretentious, and we felt as if she were talking down to us the entire time.   I think her name was Samantha, or maybe Cassandra? At any rate, it left the experience quite unpleasant.  Sorry hun, but my parents own a restaurant, and I grew up in a kitchen. However much you think you may know, you don't. Maybe you should try to pick up some professionalism at your next server job.  I'm hoping to try this place again, but hopefully they have some better staff to take care of their customers by that time."}
{"text":"Service is 5 stars  Food is 1 star Price vs value 2 Stars Atmosphere 4stars Location 4 stars"}
{"text":"The sushi was SO disappointing. No flavor at all. However their appetizers were pretty good. We got the fried brussels sprouts, pork belly skewers, tuna tar tar and the edemame. I also tried their seasonal punch which was really good but if their sushi is the main thing then THUMBS DOWN on that. We ordered the shrimp tempura, volcano, and the spider rolls. All of them lacked flavor without soy sauce. Maybe I'm spoiled by the sushi in Chicago but for how fancy this place looks I expected more."}
{"text":"It has a cool vibe, live fish swimming under glass as you walk in. For somewhere w a Sushi vibe was surprised they only offered three options sake by the glass; $8 or $15. Needless to say went w $8 to start. Bar service was very slow, could see our server waiting to get drinks and seemed like only 2 bartenders.   I tried to be open to the concept of the \"food arrives in any order & whatever comes out first\". But salads cane out last...this makes no sense. We barely touched them. Our server advised to order 2-3 things and share. I ordered a salad, yellow tail roll & Alaskan crab roll. Crab roll cane first, good, but not anything amazing. The rock shrimp was the best thing I ate. This was actually too much food. Could have gotten away w 1.5 per person.  The pad Thai was so spicy, we didn't recall it saying anything about the spice level. Barely eaten. My yellow tail roll never arrived & so I cancelled it. The rolls were pretty pricy, anything with decent fish was $15-$18. One person ordered the \"pop rock roll\". Too weird, why ruin fresh, tasty fish with chemical junk?! Keep the candy for the kids, keep the sushi classy.  Not for me."}
{"text":"I have to admit there seemed to be someone in the kitchen who did not want me to enjoy my food. I still am giving a good review since I was there on Labor Day and they probably didn't have the regular crew in the kitchen. Let me start by saying the design of the place is very well done and something I would expect to see in Dubai. I sat at the bar since I was alone and enjoyed their cocktails menu. Interesting choices and well prepared. I had the ginger green salad and spicy tuna sushi to start. The salad was perfect, and I enjoyed the sushi until I ate one piece that a big wad of wasabi on it. It was dark so I didn't see it, but I definitely tasted it! At least it cleared my nostrils, but it was wired to find that on the sushi. I then ordered the ramen looking foreword to some nice pork belly. The noodles were so salty I couldn't eat the dish. I had to send it back, which is really rare for me. Like I said at the beginning of this review I think it was not the normal kitchen staff and I will definitely come back to try again!"}
{"text":"The space is gorgeous and they have fantastic music playing that gave the whole restaurant a good vibe.  I had four different appetizers but the menu and drink options were very broad.  The lamb chop appetizer was heaven. I had stopped eating lamb because of a bad experience and then I tried it here and I'm back in love.  I definitely want to hit it back up on a Friday night because I think it would be a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"At this point, Social House Seven is pretty mediocre. I suspect they will get better in a few months. AMPD Group had similar issues with Local and Steel Cactus. I'd recommend going elsewhere for now.  We had the Mango Rangoon and Pear Wonton desserts. The idea is awesome, but they were greasy and just not very good. The idea is there, they just have to fix the delivery.  The sushi was standard. If you're downtown and just looking for sushi though, you have Penn Ave Fish further downtown and Sushi Kim closer to the Strip District.  The entrees were fine, but I'd expect more than just fine. The coconut fried rice was alright, the tofu was good, the bok choy was eh.  If their performance with Local and Steel Cactus is any indication, I suspect they'll be pretty good by late Spring."}
{"text":"Poke roll, brussel sprout salad, hamachi yellowtail, amazing drinks and decor! Great service by Jess!"}
{"text":"They did a great job on the renovation to this space, the menu offerings, and service. The service was quick and accommodating. However, our server was not able to answer many of our questions, but she did go find the answers and came back to us, which was appreciated.   The food was very good. The food comes out quickly and each dish comes out when it's ready, which is great for sharing. The menu has a lot of options and each thing we tried was fresh and delicious. We had the spicy tuna roll, fish tacos, ginger fried rice, sea bass special, and giant fortune cookie dessert. The sea bass was a great cut, was cooked perfectly, and was served on top of a creamy crab risotto- highly recommended!   I also tried their twist on a mai-tai, which is made with activated charcoal and comes out pitch black- very cool!   Overall this is a really cool, fun place to eat with delicious menu offerings. It's a must-try in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Went here with a few other couples for dinner. Service was ok. Beer selection was just ok. We ordered fried Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and had the California sushi and the volcano roll for dinner. I have to be honest here, this place was very average. The sushi was good but I've had better. Nakama blows it away."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday. Upon walking in, I loved the atmosphere, the decor, everything about it.   However, for being dead that day, the service was definitely lacking. Our entrees came before our soup and salad, so I had to ask that my sushi be kept on ice while I ate my soup. The drinks were average, highly over-priced for the tiny size, and I requested orange bitters on my drink. The bartender put the bitters in the middle of the drink and my soda water on top, which defeats the whole purpose and they were completely lost in the drink. Big let down.  As for the food...the mushroom soup was very flavorful and very spicy. I enjoyed it, despite the spice level giving me a runny nose.  For dietary reasons I requested my godzilla roll without rice, and rather than just roll them up without it like every other place does, they put everything on a plate and I had to assemble my own. I ended up having sushi tacos. They were tasty, but it seems ridiculous that I couldn't enjoy a more traditional meal, sans rice.  My friend got the salad which looked nice  and he also got the poke aloha roll. It was beautiful and tasty but extremely heavy on the rice  which for me, is a bad sign and does not reflect well on the sushi chef.   All-in-all, I would say it is a nice atmosphere, but over-priced. I would also not go again at lunch because they only serve from their lunch menu and the sushi bar menu isn't available. It was a bit anticlimactic."}
{"text":"Usually hip restaurants don't have particularly good food, and Social House Seven tries painfully hard to be hip, with the fish tank in the floor when you walk in and the colorful projections all over the walls.   I almost didn't eat here because they didn't show any reservations available on Opentable, then I somehow got double booked when I called in and tried to make a reservation. This is one area where they could definitely improve.   Anyway, this is a fun restaurant and food is tasty, but nothing was particularly mind-blowing. Service was great. It's worth a try."}
{"text":"My third time to Social House was Friday night at 6pm (so it was not terribly crowded). After two times previously , I was introducing a friend to the delectable experience (I had hoped).  Upon arriving at the restaurant with a reservation ... they sat us in the \"Buddha\" room (although the sculpture in that room is decidedly not Buddhist  but Indian... it's the goddess Kali). The room had no one else in it at the time, but was omg so muggy and hot... even the servers complained how uncomfortably hot it was. Although some air conditioning was turned out, it was decidedly too hot to consume much food or drink.  Our waitress was not the worst I've had but she ranked right up there. She took 15 minutes to get our drink order. I asked for my sake to be shaken if it wasn't very cold... she brought it back to our table and it was barely with a chill. When I said that, she replied,\"well I put it on the ticket.\"  Wth? Any other server would've taken it back and had it done right. Nope. She just left it there. Later I had to ask for ice myself. Before we ordered, she recommended her \"favorites\"... scallop pad Thai was one of them. I love pad Thai! I asked her if they could spice it up for me a little. Then my friend got an array of gluten free food that she was anxious to try after studying the restaurant menu the night before.  The only thing either one of us got that was edible was: for me- overpriced sushi, and for her- mushroom risotto with truffle butter and bok choy. Here's the disappointment: scallop pad Thai was NOT your mama's pad Thai nor anywhere close to Nicki's Thai (highly recommend and just a block or so away from Social house) ... it was over salted, had some sort of nutmeg and cayenne spices that were discernible ... but devoid of plum sauce and only a small couple of peanuts and edamame (yes, edamame). The scallops were good. But two were not worth the price of this extraordinarily bad dish.  Now comes the worse part:  they ruined the  Romanesco! When it came to our table after being prepared on the Robata (Japanese grill), dolloped with creamy feta on top) we were excited... but alas, you couldn't get your fork through it (still raw!). If you ever had Romanesco prepared correctly, you will know the disappointment that we had with this dish. We asked the server to have the kitchen cook it some more, she took the plate, asking us to remove the one we'd tried! Do you know how many good restaurants just bring you a new fresh order and not put the food that you've had your forks in sent back to the kitchen for recooking with every other diner's orders?!?? Alas the waitress came back and the vegetable was still tough. She offered to remove it from our check... but didn't. I had ordered more sake and twenty minutes later she'd forgotten that too. We got our checks and got the heck outta there... only after parting with a $150 check. The thrill is gone with the Social house. I wonder what will be the next restaurant in this space once others experience the same disappointment we did?"}
{"text":"Ambiance and food were good, however the service was TERRIBLY slow. Granted it was a packed Friday night, but we saw our server maybe once every half hour. I was born and bred eating ramen and Social House's tasted like nothing. Had to add soy sauce to get a little bit of flavor."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service from Kristy was even better! She really went above and beyond - we'll definitely be back and requesting to sit with her!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and both times were meh.  First time was with a date and they seated us at these tables where you're closer to the neighboring table than your date.  The food is overpriced for the serving size.  I got ramen that had two pieces of pork and some sparse noodles.  The sushi didn't even come out with soy sauce and we had to ask for it.  Every beer on the menu they seemed to be out of.  Overall, not impressed.  The decor is nice but that's about it."}
{"text":"An colossal rip off with underwhelming food. We ordered the Soba noodle salad, crunchy spicy tuna roll and shrimp tempura roll for delivery. The bill was $50. Giant Eagle has better rolls and the salad was all spinach with an acidic dressing. I don't mind paying for good food but this was highway robbery. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Exquisite in every way, from the innovative, delectable cuisine to the transcendent decor. From the moment we entered  the restaurant we were at awe, beautiful details emerging from the floor to the delicate and sensual sculpture of Buddha. The hand painted murals and perfectly placed lighting make this place an ideal setting for a date night or a business dinner.  The presentation of every dish was not less than a work of art, the flavors intertwine in the most armonios way, from the delicate flavor of truffles in the risotto, to the bold and exiting burst of flavor in the volcano roll.  Drinks were outstanding, fun, different and delicious. The staff was efficient and friendly. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of cleverly prepared dishes."}
{"text":"Social House Seven is good, it's just not great.   The service is easily a 10/10. Others on here have mentioned the waiter, with the thick french accent, who is just fantastic.   The drinks are okay but there is a pretty limited selection of cocktails. Everything is overly sweet. The sushi is good but ranges from somewhat to VERY overpriced, the Pad Thai was good but only had two scallops (which were admittedly perfectly cooked.)  There is a bar which you can sit both indoors/outdoors which looks enjoyable.  All in all, not bad, just not great."}
{"text":"This restaurant styles itself as high end and chic but neither it's food nor atmosphere could be considered as such. The portions are low-- my entree contained two (2) pieces of lamb, neither more than a bite each. There was nothing to accompany the lamb except three cold, sinewy pieces of asparagus. The bimbimbop had 4 pieces of meat sitting atop a large bowl of oily white rice. The monkfish skewers are basically tasteless, so you're given a cold sauce that tastes like salad dressing. Most of the dumplings only come in pairs.   tl;dr: overpriced, small portions that aren't as tasty as they are pricey."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant! The food was amazing! Everything that we tried was so good, especially the Brussel sprouts- the best I have ever had! I would definitely suggest getting multiple appetizers and sharing them, they are nice size portions and there is definitely enough to go around! I also had the scallop pad tai which was very good. The fortune cookie dessert was out of this world! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, service was great and delicious food. They accommodated our party of 10 with ease and had no issues with us splitting checks. The broccoli appetizer was delicious as well as the ginger rice and pop rock sushi! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid sushi & a nice atmosphere. Large space...decent Sake selection. Attentive service....as far as sushi goes in downtown Pittsburgh, I'd say this is an acceptable choice."}
{"text":"Came here for bachelorette party. We made reservations and came about 10 mins early and were seated immediately. Waitress was attentive and kind. I had mentioned that we had 2 bachelorettes so they ended up bringing the 2 big fortune cookies for us on the House. Meals we all good. Drinks were good. Great experience."}
{"text":"Super yummy! We come here most Sundays. Drew the bartender is the bomb. He always has a helpful food suggestion and makes the perfect bloody Mary! Had the sushi burrito today, definitely 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"This review was for lunch, and though I'm willing to give it another try, it gets a two from me for now.     I showed up for a late lunch and sat at the bar.  I was the only one there.  The bartender was friendly enough - no real issues with service except that I ordered my sushi with no asparagus and only one of them made it out that way.     The food is really where I had the issue.  The sushi menu is pretty limited - I'd definitely choose something else next time.   However, this day, I came looking for sushi.  I ordered two rolls - one topped with poke.  They were both underwhelming.  The poke was bland and boring as the rolls were too.  Nothing special at all.    A glass of house wine and the two rolls came to $40.  I don't mind spending it, but I definitely had a better lunch for far less."}
{"text":"Tonight we visited for the first time and wow what a great looking space, but the food and service was mediocre.  We ordered seaweed salad, unagi, yellow tail, rainbow roll and ramen.  The seaweed salad was dry and bland, unagi was very soggy (that is a tell tale sign of unprofessional sushi), \"king\" yellowtail had no fat marbling and the color was off, 2 of the 8 pieces of the rainbow roll where missing fish on half of each piece plus the rice inside the roll was cold potentially indicating it was premade and refrigerated, and the ramen was a bowl of bland mushy noodles and the pork belly was grey in color.    So a big nope to the sushi and ramen.  I think this restaurant has some potential, but no way I am going back.  Shame on them for serving such underwhelming food.  I'm shocked yelp reviews are so high.  If you know great sushi do not go here, and if you are expecting tentative and competent wait staff do not go here."}
{"text":"Really great food here but a tad overpriced for the sushi rolls. I had the bi bim bop and was pleased but it wasn't the best I've ever had. Big servings though. The bartender Shaffer is great at making a spicy margarita!"}
{"text":"I am going to have to give social house 3.5 stars and here's why. When we arrived we waited outside at the valet service for 5 minutes and no one showed up to take our car. We didn't want to wait any longer so luckily we found another spot on the street. The interior of this place is breath taking and I really did appreciate the level of detail that went into building this place. The food was excellent nonetheless; however, portions are very small. I can't attest to all of their dishes being this way, but what my mother and I ordered was small. I left the restaurant still hungry. The flavor of my dish was incredible though and I could have ate more of it no doubt! My dish was the short rib yaki noodles ($16)! My mom ordered the scallop pad thai ($19) which she also really enjoyed but also agreed more noodles would have been nice. I would like to come back for a late dinner and drinks. Maybe try out their sushi options or even the ramen."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The setting is great, and the service was even better. I had Kristy as my waitress, and she was very attentive to anything I needed or wanted. She recommended the Poke Aloha roll to me for lunch, and it did not disappoint :) this place is a definite recommendation to any sushi lovers. I hope to be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and not that expensive for the serving sizes and quality. The drinks were a bit nuts, but it is a restaurant downtown. We will definitely go back. I was surprised how quickly we got our food, too. Sushi restaurants tend to take a bit longer, which wasn't really the case there - even on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Upon walking into the restaurant, you cannot help but be impressed by the interior. The decor sets the tone. Very contemporary, yet intimate.    The food was also superb. My girlfriend and I shared the dumplings and brussel sprouts to start. Both were delicious. The sprouts were a surprisingly large portion for a restaurant that is more akin to a tapas style restaurant. We then each had a sushi roll and were both satisfied.  Finally, the cocktails were also great. I had the sangria and the gin and she had the mule and a martini.   The one complaint, albeit a large one, was the staff seemed extremely disorganized. It wasn't just the small stuff, it was common sense. For example, it was just me and her and at first we were seated at a large table for six. I had to ask to be moved to a smaller booth.   Everyone just seemed frazzled. It can likely be attributed to it being a new restaurant. I will be back, but it will be at least a few weeks to let the staff get it together."}
{"text":"A Groupon brought me in for the first time but the food is what brought me back! Social House Seven has some great happy hour deals on food and drinks but they also have such good food that you should come even when it isn't happy hour. I've had the Chee Chee Fried Brussel Sprouts, Steamed Pork Dumplings, Ginger Fried Rice, Short Rib Yaki Noodles, Green Forest sushi and Fortune Cookie. Everything was fresh and quickly served. Honestly, the Fortune Cookie is one of my favorite desserts. It is a giant fortune cookie filled with dark chocolate and white chocolate mousse and it is heavenly. I love dessert but it must be shared amongst your party!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful! As soon as you walk through the doors, there is a fish tank on the floor right on the entrance. The atmosphere is very elegant and the waiters are very attentive.   We made reservations online for five people and came here for dinner on a Tuesday night. We ordered sushi and sashimi to share which ranged from spicy tuna rolls to sea urchin sashimi. We also the new style sashimi dish in which we were informed that there were 8 pieces, then the waitress said it was actually 6 pieces. However, when it came out, it was actually 5 pieces. Although the sushi was good, I wasn't really impressed as the rolls were pretty small and the sashimi were thin for the price that they are charging.   Overall, it was a good experience. Perhaps we will try other things on the menu the next time."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. I've been quite disappointed in a few of the new, overpriced, super trendy places that I've tried downtown, but I would definitely go here again. I really enjoyed the set-up of the bar and dining rooms.   Apps are served tapas style, so we stayed away from that menu as there were only two of us and we were both very hungry. The whole \"tapas\" thing in general seems like a hidden way to charge more for less if it is served in a pretty way, but maybe that's just me. That being said, just know what you are ordering so you're not disappointed. Apps menu would likely be good for a large group that likes to share.  We started with sharing a Spicy Crab salad and a caterpillar roll, both of which I enjoyed and were great to share. For our entrees, I got the Sea bass Pumpkin Noodle and my friend had the Scallop Pad Thai. I really enjoyed both of those too! I didn't read the menu close enough to realize that the noodles served with my dish were squash noodles, rather than regular noodles in a pumpkin sauce, but I was still happy with my decision. Sea bass is my absolute favorite fish and it was cooked very well, perfectly juicy and buttery. The scallops were also well-cooked and although I've never had them served with a peanut-style sauce, it was a great combination.  We decided to be ultimately indulgent and also go for dessert. We split the Fortune Cookie and we didn't leave a single crumb behind. A giant fortune cookie dipped in chocolate, topped with toasted coconut and filled with chocolate mousse. You really can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Food was well below average. Enjoyed the atmosphere and that's about it. With all the superior options downtown this place belongs at the bottom of your list. Maybe stop by for drinks but I would eat somewhere else! Don't expect this place to last...it's always empty. Why did they make it so freakin huge?!"}
{"text":"I just don't understand how you can package and market something in such an appealing way that's so mediocre and charge these prices...the yellowtail scallion roll was decent. The nigiri was meh and the chicken with hidden dragon sauce was one of my all time worst food purchases. Bland. Please fix your food."}
{"text":"Give it a 5 for ambition.  The rest falls somewhere below that.  Lots of interesting ideas.  Unique preparations.  But...the food falls just a little short.    Do I love any place that tries new things? (Pop rocks in sushi, buzz buttons and dry ice with drinks) Yes.  Did those things turn out as amazing as I'd hoped?  No.    Originally started reviewing this as a 3 overall and then realized I was reminiscing about all the really fun things and 3 was too low.   This seems like it would be an amazing happy hour hangout.  The drinks, while not out of this world, were fun and innovative.  I had a sake boat (which was like an irish car bomb but with sake and bud light) that sort of missed the mark with the crappy beer.  I'm thinking next time maybe Sapporo?  I had a drink with a buzz button, \"Szechuan Buzz\" (little saliva-inducing edible flower that makes your mouth feel like it's \"buzzing\") and one with dry ice that I can't remember the name of (always a fun effect).  But none of the drinks I ordered were actually good drinks.  They were just...fun.  Novel.  A friend ordered a bourbon drink \"Yuzu Spice\" that was a bit strong for her, but I tried it and it was actually the best drink we ordered.  The appetizers (steer clear of the bok choy, which came to the table a bit gritty and had to be taken off the bill) ranged from good to great, with the Ki King Broccoli being hands down the best, and the Chee Chee Fried Brussels Sprouts giving my Pittsburgh favorites a run for their money.  The shishito peppers underwhelmed, the bonito flakes sometimes gave them a fishy taste that was offputting and the peppers were on the mild side.  The Jicama Spring Roll seemed bland, but I also didn't dip it in anything.    The Ki King broccoli and Chee Chee fried bussels sprouts deserve another mention.  The broccoli was completely different than  any preparation I'd had before and it was amazing.  I'd have ordered more.  I'd have eaten it all night.  It's that good.  The brussels sprouts too...it seems like everyone is on board the brussels sprouts express right now, but these were as good as any place in the city...and I've tried a LOT of brussels sprouts.   We didn't actually order the entrees, but got a little sushi.  I ordered the roll with pop rocks, and initial bites were a little...\"off\".  I got a really strong candy taste in the first one, and it was sort of jarring.  I think it was just a bad bite though, the rest was really good, although the pop rocks themselves weren't really contributing much to the overall taste.  The Poke Aloha was great.  I'd recommend steering clear of the Pop Rocks and trying that (unless you, like me, need the new experience.  Just to see).    Service was great.  The waitress was high energy (I think you have to be, the place was loud and busy).    Atmosphere was great...if you like loud and high energy.    Great place for happy hour/bachelor party/groups...not great for fine dining/date night.  Next time I'll try the entrees and skip the specialty drink menu."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but I was not impressed. Please note that the food comes as it is ready so if you get a sushi burrito and pad Thai, there will be a big time difference. Brussels sprouts appetizer was okay. Large enough to share with 2-3 other people but nothing special. Fish tacos tasted very fishy. Pad Thai was not good and the two scallops were fried. Sushi burrito was fine and had a good kick. Decor was nice and the staff was friendly, but I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Dined here before the theater on Saturday.  The restaurant is stunning.  Our waitress, Jennifer 41/1, was fantastic. She offered great suggestions and was prompt and courteous.  We had the quail eggs for an appetizer and loved them.  Our dinners were good and we had plenty of time to make the theater.  Overall experience was good. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I loved the look of the place. Super modern and chic. It looks like a restaurant in NYC. I like sitting in the bar area. The service was very good. The food comes out very quickly. We got several different dishes so we could try a lot more items that way. The sushi rolls were very good and tasted fresh. I would recommend going to try it. We were there 3 weeks ago and we are going again tomorrow night."}
{"text":"Yea the decoration is good and everything looks nice but the food I think doesn't worth the price. I think people go there for the decoration instead of the food."}
{"text":"Social House accommodated a big group for a friends birthday on a Saturday night a few weeks ago. We had dinner here, and then went next door to Howl at the Moon. We ordered a bunch of different items and everyone tried new things. The server was helpful in making a few suggestions of their signature items. Since it was a birthday, they brought out this huge fortune cookie desert that every one got to take a taste of.  Don't miss the chee chee broccoli!"}
{"text":"Another great restaurant by Amp'd Group based and located in Pittsburgh.   Good sushi. Sushi Bar. Nightlife. Large bar area. Dining.   Interesting and unique libations.    Hot spot for Nightlife, see and be seen. Also good spot for date night, group dinners, parties, and business social networking. Local neighborhood eatery and vibrant bar scene."}
{"text":"They say they are fusion and I say they are confused. I think they are trying to be so many things that their quality suffers. You walk in and it is packed with people. There's a giant Shiva sculpture in the corner which makes little sense, and they seem to have tried hard to make their menu sound impressive. I wasn't terribly hungry when I came, so I decided on sushi. There was only one vegetarian option. In mostl places there are either avocado, cucumber, or asparagus rolls. Here they put all three vegetables into one roll and added tomatoes on top. It was kinda weird to be honest! If they wanted to be edgy they should have served up the roll with japanese pickles inside. The table ordered broccoli and brussel sprout apps which saved this place. They were tasty and were large portions. However, I would say it's a hit or miss with sizes. Some things are literally tiny..two pieces! I don't see a reason to come back."}
{"text":"I had low expectations for Social House, mostly because it is AMPD & because the reviews weren't that great.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food, although we only had sushi.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed very large pours of wine which I am definitely not complaining about! The service was just OK, had to constantly ask for different things and was not approached by the bartendar at all to check on us, our food was spilled by the server twice upon delivery, mistakes happen I get it.  The Poke & Spider roll were delicious.  The place was surprisingly empty for a saturday night at 8 oclock but it is also HUGE inside.  I would return."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I had come here months ago for sushi only--I thought everything was rather meh, but wanted to come back and try their other food in hopes that it was better.   I was wrong. I ordered the pad thai which was recommended by our server, and it was awful. Two others in our group ordered it as well and weren't happy with it. It was spicy--which I didn't mind but others did--and had literally NO other flavors. Just spicy bland noodles. It tasted like something I would expect to get from a frozen Panda Express entree.   My husband ordered a lo mein entree. This had more flavor but was so salty, anyone with high blood pressure should stay clear. Again, this tasted like something I'd heat up in my microwave.  ...but...but....there's a GIANT (Buddha? Kali? Forgive my ignorance) statue!   ....there's koi IN THE FLOOR!  .....I can park my super expensive car outside and EVERYONE WILL SEE IT!!!  So if the \"coolness\" factor is all that's important to you, and you don't mind eating what is essentially an overpriced, microwave-quality meal, then I recommend this place."}
{"text":"First off - I am giving this two stars because j enjoyed two things - my drink and my sushi. I arrived before our reservation and had drinks and app at the bar. The Tojo mule is absolutely fantastic! And I enjoyed the dumplings and a pre dinner fare. I chose to have a farewell dinner for a friend of mine who is moving and I knew SH7 would be able to accommodate due to their lovely tables that transform for larger tables. After a few surprise guests, we ended up being a party of 10. For my meal, I ordered the spider and Godzilla rolls. Other guests ordered a mixture of things that we all tried. Chee chee Broccoli - bland. Pork Belly Skewers - too much fat than actual pork and yes I know I was tasting a pork style dish. Edamame and spicy edamame were both pretty good. My sushi rolls came out looking fantastic and tasted even better. We also accidentally received a ramen bowl - which I tasted - it tasted like the ingredients were not fresh.   What made me most disappointed about this was our cake. We brought a cake in and I called earlier and they said we can bring a cake but they charge a 3$ cutting fee. Perfectly fine. We get to the part of dinner where we wanted them to bring the cake out. They did and they plated the cake. A gentleman came over to make a big show of \"cutting the cake\". He plated the person of honors cake and then left. I thought that was strange but I assumed the cost was for purely cutting the cake.   What got me, was that there was a slightly larger table next to us celebrating a birthday and they brought a cake with candles out to sing happy birthday. Then I noticed a few minutes later that they came back from the kitchen with pieces of cake being served to the guest. Everyone in our party noticed that but we did not make a complaint since the bill had already been paid for.   The server we had was good. Prompt and itemized our checks without asking.   All in all, I find this place good for drinks and lunch time sushi. Come here for a large gathering if you want somewhere to accommodate a large party and your drink of habits but not necessarily your hunger."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful, our service was great, the food was not great.  The brussels sprouts appetizer was really good- presented with bonito flakes on it so it looks like it is alive.  It is SUPER heavy, though, even shared I felt like I ate an anvil.  I ordered the sea bass with pumpkin noodle curry and it was overall gross.   The $24 dish had a 3oz. piece of sea bass, prepared properly, but the pumpkin noodle curry was just awful. Mushy, tasteless, but I tried to choke it down because it was so expensive.  I got through about a 1/3 of it before I could not stomach any more.  It may have been missing something as simple as salt, but that dish was just screaming for flavor and some sort of crunch.  The ice cream is house made, was really good. I got mint chip, mint as in mint from your garden.  Different, but the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night during a quick stop in Pittsburgh.....sat at the sushi bar, enjoyed the quality of food, and felt the portions were big!  Surprised about the \"complaints\" about the portions other Yelpers have reported?"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday at a seemingly great, new restaurant. Perfect atmosphere. The decor is beautifully themed, but the service is lackluster. To begin, our waitress hadn't introduced herself properly, the timing of the food was completely absurd. An hour for 2 appetizers! The manager ensured us he would check on our food and never returned. I'm sure most of the kinks will get resolved as the restaurant gains it's footing, but the moderate level of anticipation did not match the outcome whatsoever. I was sorely dissatisfied with the food and even more disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"Social House Seven is a taste of NYC in the PGH. The decor is just gorgeous, from the opium den with projected smoke on the walls to the main dining area featuring giant statues surrounded in candles, and a beautiful open kitchen where you could occasionally catch a giant fire cooking your food, I couldn't stop admiring my surroundings! The extra effort in decor is what pushed this wonderful place to a five star!  Honestly, starting with the decor was tough because the food was just as much to be admired! We ordered sharing plates as the waitress suggested some dishes serve 2-4. She's was correct! The sushi was delish! Be sure to try the Pop Rocks. Who knew that Pop Rocks on sushi made so much sense? Another stand out dish was the truffle risotto, with giant scoop of truffle butter that had to be mixed at the table. For those who hate truffle oil flavor - you will appreciate the use of multiple mushrooms to achieve flavor without dousing it in truffle oil.  It's a bit on the sweet side which I adored. The sangria was the best I've had anywhere! It featured seasonal blackberries and pomegranate. Today, I'm featuring a 'worth it' hangover!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. My sushi & nigiri had bones in them. Nice ambience but the food & wine list = poor quality. Hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"Super cool/hip place! We had a very helpful waitress I think named Savannah who made our meal very enjoyable. What she lacked in height she made up for in kindness! The shrimp tempura is delicious and the broccoli is very good as well. I didn't try the entrées but they were reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good food and service.  Price is a little high compared to other restaurants of this type and quality in the area."}
{"text":"Eat here!  Have fun here!  Great crowd, amazing atmosphere.  A lot of care and planning was put into this place and it shows."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's finest, hands down. Social House is exactly what the city has been missing. From the breathtaking decor to the detail in each dish, Social House is a true dining experience. I would consider myself a regular having dined 1-2 times a week since they've opened the doors. I have tried almost everything on the menu. The idea of the menu is that most dishes are shareable which makes it great to have the opportunity to try multiple dishes. The Waygu (which is comparable - if not better - to my absolute favorite steak at STK in Las Vegas), the Yaki noodle dish is to die for, the broccoli appetizer will leave you wanting more and POP Rock sushi roll (Yes, I said Pop Rock) has the perfect mixture of a popping sensation with shrimp, asparagus, avocado, topped with a spicy aioli that is an absolute must have. The menu is very affordable. The staff is great. I've got to know a few of the waiters/bartenders really well and they seem just as enthused about the establishment as I was. The icing on the cake is that once your done eating, you don't want to leave. The vibe is great and music creates a great atmosphere to enjoy drinks with friends. It's the perfect place to accommodate your family, friends, co-workers or for a date night out. I consider this place the new hot spot in Pittsburgh. The best part is you don't even feel like you're in the city... more like New York or Miami. A must try for sure!"}
{"text":"There were 15 of us for a birthday celebration, the service was horrible, and the food even worse. If just one or maybe two of us did not like our meal that would be one thing but all 15 had some issue with the taste of the food."}
{"text":"Two people of four people at my table ordered sushi and got their meals in a reasonable amount of time. The other 2 people at my table ordered rice dishes and had to wait an additional 40 min before they were served. It took the server 20 min to even realize they did not receive their meals because she was not attending to the table. Mind you, we were the 5th table to sit for lunch.  It was clear that our order had not been sent to the kitchen in the 1st place or that the kitchen lost our ticket because of the 20 min it took to get our food after alerting the server that our order was incomplete.  Things happen at restaurants out of the servers control (I know this from years of my serving) but the least the server could have done was acknowledged and/or rectify the situation. Neither of which were done. In fact it took an additional 15 min to ask if the rice was ok after the long wait. No comped food or even an apology for the inconvenience.  Our 1 hour lunch hour turned into an hour and a half at the restaurant most of which was unpleasant.  Only rating 2 stars because I enjoyed my sushi but the rice was definitely NOT worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our experience here on a Friday night during light up night. What I liked the most is that the plates are easily shareable & family style friendly. The brussel sprouts were delish, Sushi was tasty & plenty of offerings for vegetarians. There was a DJ playing some vibe tunes & our waiter was very attentive knowing the menu well. It can get a little loud when crowded but I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"All in all, my family was pretty happy. The food was generally tasty. I did want to note that my dad and I were shocked at the small portion size of the scallops dish; it definitely felt like a rip-off. Otherwise, we were quite happy, and we would definitely return."}
{"text":"Social house has awesome atmosphere and a modern vibe. Setting and decor are to the point. Service is pretty good. Tables a bit close to each other so feels a bit congested.  A good place to visit with a group of foodies."}
{"text":"Location: 7th Street beside Howl @ the Moon. Street parking is tough. I recommend parking garages or lots when attendants are present.  Ambience: The koi under the floor entering were not around, hopefully due freezing temps. The doors and windows let a pretty whispy draft through the bar area. The samurai metallic black and bamboo floors and decorations are fitting, and the restaurant has a individual feel to it.  I would recommend reserving a red booth for a party of 3-5ppl. They overlook the seating but your legs are exposed to those sitting at tables below... kind of a strange set up. However, I did not have a chance to see it at capacity in full-swing.  Food: I was here for lunch and had the Korean Cheesesteak and Poke Aloha roll. They both were great recommendations from the bartender. The cheesesteak had a spicy bbq sauce that was on point.   Drink: Good scotch on deck: Macallan 12 and 18yr, Laphroaig 10yr. Double cross vodka which is hard to find in Pittsburgh. Also a diverse selection of Japanese whiskey... again, hard to find.  Overall: Good food for lunch and friendly staff. Service isn't polished and it's cold inside when it's cold outside. Good spot for sushi on a weekend when sushi no. 1 is closed."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I cannot do a food review because I was unable to eat at the restaurant.  If you have food allergies....Social House is not for you!!  The chef does not have a separate grill or wok to prepare shellfish dishes.....so the fish and shellfish cross-contaminate.  Additionally, all the sushi...even shell fish sushi has fish eggs on the outer layer.....in this day and age, I was shocked.  Went with a group...so I just had a cocktail.    I did appreciate there honesty....this could have been deadly!  Ambience was to die for.  There is a curbside bar that fully opens up in good weather!  Cute date night spot if you can eat all types of fish!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Social House twice but the first time I only had beer so I figured i'd wait for food to happen before I judged. I have a lot of positives and a few critiques about the dinner I had there last night. I went with 3 other girls. The staff was super friendly and our waitress was really helpful and nice! She told us that they specialize in small plates. So, to say that we ordered an insane amount of food would be an understatement. I believe we ordered about 5 apps and 3 entrees to share. All of the food was fantastic!! Some of the highlights would be the chee chee brussel sprouts and the scallop pad thai. The aloha poke roll was also a big hit with everyone. I really have zero complaints about any of the food or the staff.   Now onto a few issues. While our waitress was great, i wasn't expecting some of the portions of the food to be so large because of being told it was small plates. Not generally an issue, unless you have no ability to take leftovers home and have to waste delicious, precious food!  That criticism is minor and really, who cares if the food is good? The one issue I had with the meal  what the timing. Yes, i want my food out hot, fresh and fast. But, everything came out practically at once and it made the meal pretty hectic. With this crowd... the older we get, the more anxious we get and i was pretty shocked no one needed a paper bag. I'll definitely be returning to Social House and now I am equipped with the knowledge to make the meal worth 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Social House Seven for weeks..months, even. I was so excited to try it out. We figured that a Tuesday evening would be a great date night. Unfortunately this fortune cookie has crumbled.  In pictures and walking by, this place looks like a trendy, upscale restaurant for the theatre crowd looking to get a bite before a show or a night out downtown. It has all the makings of a great restaurant. From the moment you walk in, you are greeted by a coy pond underneath your feet and Asian decor that leaves no detail left behind.  But what was left behind was the fish in my sushi. Never before have I eaten a roll that was 80/90% rice. The sushi wasn't the only thing that was bland. The entrees, though clever, were also a bit bland and certainly overpriced. We tried the pork dumplings, spicy tuna roll, coconut fried rice, hamachi robata, and chicken with hidden dragon sauce. As we took bites of everything, we expected an explosion of flavor and exotic pairings on traditional classics. Unfortunately, all I can remember is a vaguely ginger protein dish--where everything tasted basically the same.  I know that the restaurant is trying for a dim sum or tapas vibe, but then you need to commit to smaller (cheaper) portions and punch up the flavor profile of each serving.   The restaurant is still an interesting place to visit, especially where Asian restaurants are already lacking downtown. However, I would only come back to visit it as more of a cocktail spot rather than commit to a full dinner.  Looking back at the reviews...Huyen really hit the review on the head here!  If you're downtown and looking for an Asian meal, it could be worth checking out."}
{"text":"Looking to try something a little different, for the first time with you. It was late and luckily we stumbled upon this restaurant. It was actually really cool upon walking in. There were Koi Fish under the floor. The place was really oddly set up based just on seating. The facility can open the large wall/windows and see the outside which is nice for summer.   The seating was my only thing I did not really like. You face everyone in the crowd rather than facing each other. It was also pretty hot in there; even our waiter was sweating.   I could've drank 18 waters, it was like I was lacking liquids a lot.   Anyhow, I'm not really good at picking different food but ordered edamame, lettuce wraps and I strictly remember the pop rocks roll with actual CANDY on it. How cool?   I could sit there, sweating with you for a long time as long as the water was being refilled."}
{"text":"This place has great ambience. That's probably the best thing about it. I had a nice experience here, with a large group of friends. The cocktails and bartenders were great. My server walked me through gluten-free options, which I appreciated. The menu looked amazing and interesting, but I have to say it was not impressive.  I ordered the Breakfast of Champions (description sounded amazing) but I was underwhelmed. The quail egg was thoroughly cooked and the bacon was fatty and chewy, so I had to spit lots of it into a napkin (sorry!) because you literally couldn't break it down in your mouth. Loved the idea but the execution was disappointing.  Also ordered the tuna tartare and that was good! Brussels sprouts are also good. Sushi was ok.  A couple of people at our table mentioned that their food was REALLY salty (I know the miso soup was one of the over-salted items). Our table got the crème brûlée and fortune cookie desserts. Both were good. So, I guess my point is that the food doesn't measure up to the aesthetics. If you stick with drinks and socializing, you will enjoy yourself. Reminds me of Nakama, back in the day."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I went to dinner Thursday night & Ashley waited on us. Ashley was AMAZING! She was very helpful with the menu & helped us choose what we should order, since I do not eat seafood. The Brussel sprout appetizer was amazing & worth coming back just for those. Also they can make a great Manhattan."}
{"text":"Second time is a charm, or that's the saying. Once again service seems to be an ongoing theme with this place. Me and friend went here for lunch will lunch is over at 2:30 so dinner. We were the only ones in the restaurant and the service was still horrible. However the food this time around was delicious. We had duck crepes and I'm not a fan of duck but the meat was so tender and had a really good smoke taste. We also had bacon wrapped quail eggs. Can't go wrong wrapping anything with bacon. And the price was really good. I had the godzilla sushi roll and my friend had the one with poprocks. The poprocks was interesting didn't add any extra flavor but popped in your mouth. It was interesting but one time is all you need. I wish they would work on having better service."}
{"text":"We just ate here.  The drinks were excellent.  My wife's sushi was good.  I order the chicken soy meal.  Out came two tiny and I MEAN tiny skewers that after two bites they were gone.  $65.00 bucks and left hungry.  No rice or veggies with them.  Ugh feel ripped off.  Great atmosphere, nice waiter but the portions.....horrid.  They could be great but making stupid mistakes.   Go for the drinks but leave.  Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weeknight. Ordered the rock shrimp and Brussels sprouts appetizers. Both had little flavor but tasted soaked in grease... had 2 sushi rolls which were decent but we're more rice than anything... maybe some of the other food they serve is ok but I was fairly disappointed especially for a place that is pricier than the average sushi place.  The biggest problem was it seemed very dirty. Our menu had syrupy drink splattered all over it and you could see the table was barely cleaned off. For a fairly new restaurant it looked incredibly worn.  I definitely will not return."}
{"text":"I was beyond excited to check out this new restaurant and unfortunately it was not everything I hoped it would be. We went here for a friends birthday dinner and the restaurant was so loud that you had to yell just to hear the person next to you. We couldn't talk as a group because it was so loud which was unfortunate since we came here to celebrate a friend together. In addition to that the restaurant is extremely crowded. I felt like the wait staff was constantly right on top of us as they were walking by.   As for the food, we all agreed that our food wasn't amazing. I knew coming here that this was more of a tapas style dining experience so a lot of us ordered a few options for ourself. It all came out randomly but it came one after another. Thankfully my friend next to me wasn't eating so I could take up extra space for all the plates. The portion sizes are also so random. Some are super tiny and others are gigantic. If it's meant to be tapas style then the portions should be more consistent. I went with the spicy tuna roll and it was just average. It was probably the best thing I had but I've definitely had way better sushi. The soba noodles I got were also just ok. They had a nice flavor but I probably wouldn't order it again. Lastly, I ordered the ramen bowl which I would not recommend. My friend and I both didn't eat ours after we too one bite because the broth had a terrible taste.   I've either heard people rave about this place or complain about this place so I definitely wouldn't discourage anyone from checking it out at least once. The restaurant itself is beautiful!"}
{"text":"Loved the decor of the place. Very nice details on the hanging lanterns, woodwork booths, and coy fish under the floor in the entryway. The food wasn't that great to be honest. Also, the restaurant was about 2/3 empty and instead of being seated in a both with my date, we were seated in a concentrated area of a large group, which resulted in me being hit in the back by the servers constantly bringing the group new dishes. While the servers were apologetic, it was disruptive and detracted from my experience.   The pork belly appetizer was pure fat. The wonton was friend fat. Both of these appetizers made us sick from the grease overload and had little to no flavor other than fat.   The grilled salmon and rice was much better and $14 for 5oz of salmon wasn't a bad price, but a scoop of Panda Express white rice was a cop-out side dish. The salmon wasn't terrible but it was not flavorful and had fishy undertones.   The Thai Chicken Lettuce wraps were good. No complaints.   The sea bass and pumpkin noodles my date ordered were overpriced at $24 for mediocre fish that was very thin cut. The pumpkin noodles were disappointing as they were unevenly cooked. Some were soft, some were almost raw hard, and overall bland.   I would concur with most other reviews that the decor and atmosphere are impressive and the location was good. But for nearly $100 (with Tip), I could think of 20+ restaurants in walking distance I'd rather go to. This was a $30 meal at best.   NOTE: I lived in Asia three years and none of this was authentic. So glad I avoided the sushi!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in the city.  Never disappoints.  Incredible atmosphere. Nothing else like it in the city. I would highly recommend this place. My personal favorite is  the short rib and brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"Make reservations! Great atmosphere and great food. Our server was so nice and helpful with recommending items to try. Flavor was amazing in the different dishes. Dishes are made to share. We had the Brussel sprouts and rock shrimp appetizers those are a must. Pop rock sushi with actual pop rocks on top was a unique twist! New favorite sushi! Must try the big fortune cookie for dessert! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food is meh here... they are trying to hard without the culinary skills to execute.  Drinks are good.  Turns into a club late night on the weekends.  The set up is good and has potential.  Crowd is mixed, from young professional to an overload of wasted suburbanite cougars.  Upgrading the music could draw a better crowd. The dj is a sin.  The music is TERRIBLE and sounds like you're at a bad wedding... it's hard to get over."}
{"text":"I was there on a slow night, and none of the service issues that other reviews mentioned were a problem. We sat at the bar and ordered from both the sushi and regular menus. The cocktails were great, the food was delicious, and the bartender was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"My friend lives very close to Social House Seven, so when I decided to visit her for lunch, I ordered takeout of their chee chee brussel sprouts and bi bim bap online. When I arrived, no one made eye contact with me for at least 4 minutes, despite there only being 3 other customers in the restaurant, seated at the bar. I think a \"we'll be with you in just a second\" goes a long way toward establishing some hospitality. My order wasn't quite ready, and then they almost let me walk off without paying for it.  When I finally did get to sit down and dig in, I found the brussel sprouts really flavorful, but very, very greasy. I don't usually feel guilty about eating brussel sprouts, but this basically felt like eating a cabbage-y pizza...in a (mostly) good way. I think some of that might have been because it was takeout and spent some time steaming/wilting in the plastic container.   The bi bim bap, however, was incredibly disappointing. The meat was tough and it tasted like it was brined in pure vinegar. The veggies were bland and underwhelming. The bowl was 70% unseasoned rice, and I ended up throwing most of it out because it wasn't worth the energy of carrying it back to the office.   I'd consider visiting again if I could stay and appreciate the ambiance of the restaurant, but I definitely would not order takeout again. I'm not usually the kind of person who complains about her food, but if that bi bim bap had arrived at my table, I would have sent it back to the kitchen.  I shared a little with my friend and she described my bi bim bap as \"utter garbage.\" I could not agree more.  Overall, it was a $22 lunch that was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I came to Pittsburgh for a business trip and they took us here. The ambiance is fun and hip. Dark decor, very nicely decorated.   I should've titled this review, SALTY! OMG, the food is sooo salty. They add so much salt because the food has no taste. The appetizers we ordered were okay. We got: brussel sprouts, chicken lettuce wraps, tuna tartare, and the rockin' shrimp. They were all pretty good and you get a nice sized portion. We also got the pork belly. Now I know pork belly is salt but this pork belly was SALTY!!! I ate one piece and gave the other to a friend. I just couldn't eat it. The sushi was bland. We got the volcano, which was the best tasting one but still bland compared sushi I've had at other places. The spider didn't have any other taste but salt. Didn't care for it. I tried someone's noodle salad. It was pretty good.   The drinks were pretty good. I got the punch of the day. It had sake in it but it was a good fruity flavor.   The service was pretty good. The waitress was attentive and prompt. We all liked her.   Overall, if you like salt, you'll love this place. If you have high blood pressure...STAY AWAY! Can't say I'd return."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for quite some time for this place to open after it has taken over the old location of Bossa Nova. And then when it finally arrived....I finally made it!!!! Social House is a very attractive environment with the fish tank floor upon entry. The waiter was very friendly and the best part, not annoying. Sometimes restaurants can go over board with the constant approaching the table. But he was very appropriate, but attentive and we enjoyed that. I had the Crispy Rock Shrimp and Salmon with Sushi Rice, it was very delicious but portions are quite small so be aware. It was enough for us, but not sure if It would be enough for others. For the drink, I enjoyed the Toji Mule. And endless sparkling water! My friend had the Sea Bass - and I did taste. It was very delicious. From a far at another table, I saw them serve from what it seems the Mongo Mongo Lamb Chops. I will try that next time.  It is a great place for a ladies night, date, or din din before a show. I look forward to coming back to try some of the other menu options."}
{"text":"We love the bar atmosphere and have been very happy many times with our sushi. The last two times we've gotten sushi as take out, they have been packed with green onions instead of avocado or cucumber. This isn't on the menu and we've never seen this in sushi. We asked a bartender the last time we were in and she said that isn't normal. Then it happened again. Not sure if they have a rogue sushi chef but we are now wary to get our sushi here. The other times we have gotten it (without green onions) were delicious though!"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely excellent!  Also, this place has nice decor, windows opened which makes it nice on a summer night.  I am only giving it a 3 because the food was just ok.  We got the tuna tartare amd spicy edamame which was very good.  Then we got the crispy tuna roll, rainbow roll and the one with eel that I can't remember the name of.  The avacado was hard and they just didn't have much flavor.  The cocktails were interesting, but pretty standard.  I might go back to try some of the non-sushi menu items, but the sushi was just so-so."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to the bar early before our reservation. It was crowded and cold by the windows but the fabulous house Cabernet warmed us up!  It did take a minute to get our drinks but the bartender apologized and took care of us. The host finally sat us down at our table which was a disappointment. We were crammed to the table next to us and the lights were so bright, also the tables were so long it was hard to hear my boyfriend talk. We moved to the bar, which was less crowded and much more intimate. The service at the bar was great! The sushi was amazing, probably the best we have had in Pittsburgh. We were very pleased with the final result, great food & bar atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Took the afternoon off and decided to come here for a late lunch.  We had a great time.  The decor is awesome.  It's a neat mix of Japanese, Chinese, and American industrial gothic (I think I just made that up lol.)  There is a side room behind the sushi bar with a large buddist deity.  We sat in a booth. The booths are half oblong circles like you'd see in night clubs of the 1950's, and they're on a platform raised about a foot off the ground. It gave a nice vantage point of the rest of the space.  We started off with a couple mules. They were awesome - totally relaxed us.  I sipped mine, my companion downed hers and got a second one.  For lunch I couldn't make up my mind!  I wanted to sample it all. I picked the short rib yaki. It was good (but it didn't knock my socks off the way the mule did.)   The server was very helpful, volunteering lots of information about the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant has all the potential to be great.  A good location and interesting menu.  However, the decor is tacky, it would be better to add some neon lights and go for a John Carpenter Big Trouble in Little China theme.  The ramen was so salty it could barely be eaten.  The dessert was good and the quail eggs were very good.  I wouldn't return to this place unless they scale the down the sodium."}
{"text":"Ordered sushi and the hummus appetizer for takeout and was so disappointed. The sushi had a million scallions in it (I didn't think it was possible to ruin a Philly roll, but it is, and it's by adding scallions to it) and the spicy tuna roll had asparagus in it (I wouldn't have ordered that had it stated that in the online menu). Furthermore, the hummus was so salty it was inedible and I threw the whole thing out. The bar was nice when I went but drinks are the only thing I'll be having there going forward."}
{"text":"Very disappointing food. We ordered a variety of dishes and each one was either over salted or very under flavored. The price was higher than average too. The ambience was good but the music was a bit too loud."}
{"text":"My first review wasn't too flattering but I continued to give it a try as nothing else like it downtown. First off my last three meals have been flawless and wonderful. Great service great food! I think maybe this place opened and some kinks needed worked out. Secondly I had the PRIVILEGE of meeting their chef who is not only an amazing chef but an amazing person. Their manager is as well. I'm so happy such a wonderful location which great aesthetics has now the service and food to go with it. I happily go weekly and will continue to do so"}
{"text":"Having never had sushi as a team we decided to go \"different\" in our search for later food on a Friday evening. Came upon this spot via yelp in a the downtown area which has several restaurants and nightclubs in the vicinity.   This is a very large place with outdoor seating on the sidewalk where the windows fold away and there is a bar in the window to sit at. Plus there is inside seating at both tables, bar, and half circle booths. Problem with asking for a booth was that you face everyone else and it is somewhat awkward.   Went with the edamame and lettuce wraps for appetizers. Edamame was well salted and plentiful. Funny I used to eat these religiously and back eating them again. The lettuce wraps were a build your own style - would've liked more a a stronger lettuce leaf but still good.   For entree we just shared three sushi rolls - Godzilla, volcano, and pop rocks. Yes the candy. Pop rocks was my favorite - somewhat on the spicy side but it literally has pop rocks that crackle in your mouth. Not sure if it's done elsewhere but I liked it. Volcano and Godzilla rolls were good as well.   MY BIGGEST ISSUES COME with the neighborhood and the intermingling of the two. On the walk in this Jimmy Bombooch dude in all white suit items and a blue vest was handing out cards to the club across the street- and was VERY SLIMY approaching people. Also on our way to the front door heard another guy say same and try and solicit people. It's not like this was a co-sponsoring- it was heavy solicitation and really a turnoff for me. Also - the problem is these people were freely walking through the restaurant and acting very odd.   Nice place- funky decor and after I believe 10? A a dance floor and lighting. I guess I'm getting old and don't want to mess with that?   Good sushi!!"}
{"text":"I got take-out from this restaurant, and it was fantastic. I had the soba noodle salad, which contained beets, carrots, spinach, and peanuts. I think it was missing the snow peas, which were listed on the menu, but it was fantastic. I also got the mango coconut rice pudding. It was scrumptious. So very good! While I didn't stay to eat in the restaurant, the atmosphere looked great, and football was on their TVs."}
{"text":"This is a really cool and unique place to eat. It's definitely worth a try and you won't be disappointed in the food! Our server David was Fantastic and offered some great suggestions!"}
{"text":"Chefs Q and Luke were beyond amazing! Great service at the Sushi Bar! Very delicious Passion roll! Topped our dinner off with a Giant Fortune cookie!!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"These were the best lettuce wraps ever!  The waiter was amazing and Ryan Higgins is not hard on the eyes as well!"}
{"text":"We wanted to live their menu but we did not.  If you are here for sushi. It's fresh it's well done and you are good. But the other dishes.... 7 out of 10 were rather bland. We love Asian food and the kick of flavor to it. Here the chef is a bit consevative  Great ones :  Scallop Pad Thai Shishito peppers  Pork belly   Tasteless: Monkfish skewers  Rock Shrimp  Lettuce wraps Broccoli/ cawliflower veggie Rice cakes  Sushi roll   I don't think we are going to dine here except if we don't find another  sushi place."}
{"text":"Five stars because I haven't had food like this anywhere else in Pittsburgh - bold flavors and creative, with tons of vegetable-focused and vegetarian-friendly dishes.  I loved the tofu main (listed under Meats) and the Brussels sprouts salad.  My five stars are definitely for the food - the service wasn't great.  Though the space itself is pretty cool looking..."}
{"text":"The social house is deff a 10/10! The pork dumplings were really good too! Our bartender Caleb was awesome as well!! Would recommend to anyone who is in the mood for decent priced alcohol and amazing food!"}
{"text":"The vibe is a unique mix of \"happy hour/beach bar\" and fancy restaurant.  The bar area is towards the front, and the restaurant area is towards the back.  We were craving some sushi and had heard incredible things about their sushi specials - we were NOT disappointed! The Poke Aloha roll was unbelievable. We will definitely be returning for a second helping someday."}
{"text":"Social house is definitely a cool atmosphere, somewhere fun to hangout and have drinks with friends while in the downtown area on a Friday or Saturday night.   However, as far as the food, the sushi was disappointing. I came here with high expectations, but I've definitely had much better sushi elsewhere. We also ordered the shrimp skewers which was the best part of the meal by far. This is found under the Robata portion of the menu, offering multiple seafood, meat and vegetable options grilled on Japanese charcoal. There are other options on the menu including a long list of appetizers and some unique soups, salads and noodles/rice. I'd definitely be willing to come back and try this place again and order some different menu offerings, but the sushi was unfortunately subpar."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Kani salad is a definite No way but sushi and salmon was great! Coconut rice was excellent. Service was not the best but overall not bad."}
{"text":"Service (4/5) - relatively new staff, forgot some things - good attitude and friendly environment  - attentive  Food (2/5) - sushi was pretty good - ramen is horrible. Uses Chinese lo mein noodles, salty beef broth - rest of food is 50/50.  What you expect from an AMPD establishment  - what do you expect when you call it an izakaya....a Japanese word but serve everything from Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean, etc.  oh yeah all Asian food is the same  Ambiance (4/5) - good music, lots of people - great atmosphere  Update - Jan 13, 2017 They actually reached out and said they revamped their ramen so wanted me to revisit.  Sooo.....actually nothing was different.  Sushi wasnt bad, excellent service but ramen was actually worse now than before.  This time they overlooked the ramen, it was chopped up into pieces, and no more chashu but instead they put shredded pork in it..... overall quite disappointing."}
{"text":"This was one of the few restaurants opened post show on a Sunday so we figured we'd try it. The decor is nice and very eclectic. We started out with appetizers: calamari and the duck crepes. The calamari was delicious but the duck barely contained any duck and was more of a flatbread than a crepe. Our waiter seemed a bit distracted although there were only a few tables dining. The Bibimbap was bland with no flavor. My BF lived in S. Korea years ago and was not impressed by this dish whatsoever. The pad Thai was tasty with good flavor and a large portion. The clincher was that all of a sudden the lights were turned on very bright as we were finishing our dinners. We proceeded to question our server why turn up the lights and he said, \"well our kitchen closes at 10pm so they turn the lights on.\" Ummm.....we're not in the club; it's supposed to be a nice dining experience. I don't know that we'd go back or if so, a different day and time."}
{"text":"It's the worst service I ever got in my whole life. The bartender ignored us and once we ordered round 2 we never got drinks and had to reorder again. Once the bill came they charged us for the drinks that we ordered but never got. The manager didn't even listen to us for what happened. I got really bad experience at this place."}
{"text":"Wow. I wish I had the pictures from the night we were here to add to this review.   PEEEYEEEEWWWWW  We went to try this place out as there would be Vegan options, it looked kind of upscale (so we dressed up) and was something new. I think it might have been a week night, summertime and the windows were open so a great space for people watching. The restaurant was nearly empty.   Walked in, 3 people standing at the door just stared blankly back at us and finally someone acknowledged us after about 2-3 minutes. They sat us by the window on a couple of stools.   No menus fro 5 minutes. No water, no one came to see us. Bear in mind the restaurant was EMPTY except for one party of about 6.   Finally, we had to get up and ask for a menu. 5 more minutes, still no one. We had to get up again and ask for a waiter.   When our waiter finally arrived (sorry to judge but this is a pricey restaurant) he was missing a lot of his teeth, the ones he did have were blackened and he smelled like smoke. I think he might have been from France...had a french-type accent. He was kind of aloof, took our drink orders and then 10 more minutes went by before we received drinks.   We placed our order for about 5 dishes...which he said would be \"more than enough\" for the two of us.   Let me make a long story short; LITERALLY 6 PIECES OF ASPARAGUS and 1 section of grapefruit for $12-15USD is NOT ok. This is not an organic restaurant...even then that would be robbery. It was slapped on a plate ( i do have this shot posted on my instagram) and just dumped in front of us with 0 care and attention.   3 shrivelled, dry, tasteless portobello mushroom caps stuck on bamboo skewers also do not command that same pricing.   This place is too big for it's britches and needs a reality check. If you're going to price your food to pay for your rent in an upscale location, you need to provide value for the cost. This place does not.   Two big, angry, ripped off thumbs down."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere too! A tip...if Party of 4, do NOT get a booth unless u want to be cramped with deep vein thrombosis!  Poor design there."}
{"text":"I am still unsure if I truly like this place. I think that this experience is a lot better than my last one. But still I am on the fence because something always has to happen that makes me question coming here again or just shaking my head. This time it was the host asking for the menu back and me stating we were going to keep it since we were just ordering on the fly and might want one to look over. The host then said, well, if you want to do that then you can ask for it back but until then can you give it to me. I was taken aback, like...um...? Ok? I looked over to the fellow ladies at the table and we were all like, \"did that really happen?\" We told our waitress who was appalled and she got the menu back for us and apologized, she on the other hand was wonderful, attentive, and super great, not her fault that that happened at all! But still it is little things like this that make me suggest other places than Social House Seven. Because when you are out celebrating a birthday and MAY order more food and you state that, why the heck would you take the menu away from a customer? Super weird.  The food this time I will say I enjoyed a lot better. I picked some of the stuff that I had before and it tasted better this time around.   Food: Appetizers:  THAI LETTUCE WRAPS:Grilled chicken, carrots, daikon, sprouts, peanut dipping sauce. These were really good. And they came pre-made with three on a dish. The three part worked out since there were three of us at dinner! The wraps tasted like standard lettuce wraps. I would like to see a better/more flavorful sauce pairing but they were really good.   Noodles: RAMEN: Pork belly, pork shoulder, bamboo shoots, scallions, spinach, soy sauce egg, shoyu broth. Last review I was not super excited about this but this time I was actually feeling a little under the weather and wanted some soup. It was really good for my tummy to eat something like this. The salt was not as much as before and I did not leave feeling bloated. Better but I will say that the veggies overtook the bowl and I didn't realize that the meat was mostly at the bottom of the bowl. So as I was eating the noodles and the veggies the meat was just dropping to the bottom of the bowl. It ended up that I had a bowl of meat forgotten about and next time I will have to remember to look for more of the meat. I just thought that the meat portion was small and in-fact it was a lot larger and just being missed because of how I was eating the dish.   Robata: SHRIMP SKEWERS:Lime, cilantro. These were great. They were smokey grilled and the lime and cilantro made them taste like summer. I would have gotten three more of these if we would have thought about it. But we ordered this after we ordered the other food, so it was more like a palate cleanser! But so good. There were three shrimp on the skewer so this again worked out in our favor.   Sushi: SHRIMP TEMPURA:Cucumber, avocado, tobiko, house teriyaki. Standard shrimp tempura sushi. Really good and a nice little appetizer before dinner.   Dessert: LYCHEE CREME BRULEE. This was amazing. Fresh fruit on top a nice crispy sugar layer. Creme brulee is my favorite type of dessert and this was a really good version of it. YUM.  So this visit was a lot better than the last time. I am still waiting for the perfect trip. Maybe someday!  Also as a funny side note. I went to the bathroom and the stall that I used the toilet seat was not screwed down to the toilet. So I went to sit down and I slid off the toilet and almost into the bowl! I had a little bit of a laugh, and told the staff. But it seems whenever I go here there has to be something!!"}
{"text":"Drinks are out of this world! Bartender Shaffer took care of us and we had a great experience with the food from each style. The lamb chops were perfect and the desserts were not what we expected and totally made the meal excellent. Everyone from the Valet to the Chef made Social House 7 an amazing experience. We will be back soon"}
{"text":"The Poke Aloha roll. Start and end there. In all seriousness, I have been to Social numerous times and have tried a majority of the sushi menu. But every time I come back to the Poke Aloha roll. To the extent that my group of friends will just ordered 2-4 orders of just that roll. (Pictured is 3 orders of Poke Aloha and a rainbow roll hiding in the back). We sometimes mix it up and will start with the spicy edamame which is incredible. The spices are the perfect balance will a kick but nice salty touch that I like when eating edamame from the shell.   I have never had a bad experience at Social. It is a great date night spot, or a place to go to hang out with friends. The drinks are always on point and they take reservations, although that is usually not a problem.   We have found that the booths are absolutely fantastic for people watching but a little tough to communicate if there are actually 4 of you sitting in the booth. If I have 4 people in my party, I try to request a table. If it is just a friend and I, we will sit at the bar because the chairs/ two seater benches make conversation a lot easier and not quite as distracting.   I will say whoever was bartending on June 7, 2017 around 8-10 pm was absolutely fantastic. I did not catch her name, but she has apparently been with social since they opened and she knew how to make quality cocktails. If I am back and she is on shift I will most definitely be ordering a Hendricks dirty martini with olives."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I ordered a shrimp appetizer which had two different shrimp flavors. I'd probably order that again. It was a nice size portion for an appetizer. The lychee martini I had was sooo good and for my main meal I ordered Pad Thai. I sent it back. The noodles were a good flavor but the chicken wasn't what I was used to when I normally order Pad Thai. Seemed like chicken pieces I could sauté up at home and throw on top. Wasn't impressed at all. The atmosphere and the decor....BEAUTIFUL. Impressive looking restaurant. I would probably come back to see what the night life was like and maybe try the sushi next time if I chose to eat here again."}
{"text":"Our server was amazing! Hey David! I just didn't particularly care for the food. I ordered the spicy edamame. Spice level? Fantastic! But it just seemed off. I got the Bip Bam Bop. Again, it seems like it should be good. But it was off. I will say, my husband and friend thought it was amazing when I gave the food to them. My husband ordered the Godzilla roll and that was great! I'll give it another go, but will not order the same thing."}
{"text":"Large space with stunning design and decor. Service was good, but could be improved by more teamwork among the Servers. Food was very good;   little softer hand on the salt would be a positive. The menu is \"small plates\".  This Tapas stlye is fine for 2-4 people but can be awkward with larger groups. Strongly hope they quickly add more \"large plate\" alternatives or Family Style portions."}
{"text":"This review is only based on the sushi, as we didn't try any of their other asian inspired dishes. I liked that they brought out the rolls as they were ready, as it was just 2 of us sharing everything. I could see how this would be a little odd if the table wasn't planning on all sharing, but the servers explain how it works right away. Their signature rolls were pretty tasty and they didn't disappoint with classics like the spicy tuna roll.   The only real negative was that they have a live dj and the music is LOUD. At first the two of us were seated at opposite ends of a long-ish table that would've been really awkward for sharing dishes and we would've had to yell over the music the entire meal. If I hadn't asked to switch to the empty booth behind us our dinner experience probably wouldn't have been nearly as nice."}
{"text":"My friends & I found this gem before a show at the Benedum. We literally stumbled in off the street and LOVED the look before we ever got inside! When you open the glass front doors you immediately walk across a glass covered coi pond - startling at first, but awesome. The interior atmosphere is very warm and welcoming. We sat at the bar and ordered appetizers. The shrimp skewers were fabulous, as were the items ordered by the others. I would have given it 5 stars but we found the drinks a bit pricey. All in all, I will definitely return and recommend to my friends!!"}
{"text":"Great find downtown. Had grilled Wagyu beef with grilled asparagus -- both delightful. Beef cut in portions for chopstick use with good soy and aioli dipping sauce options. Others had rainbow sushi platter and bibimbap. Sushi melted in the mouth. Should have asked for the gochujang sauce on the side as it was a bit warm.   Wait staff were attentive and helpful when choosing the food. On our list to come back to when we are in town again."}
{"text":"We went for a late night sushi meal. We thought the sushi was quite good and the special roles were quite tasty."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner before a show at the Benedum, would definitely recommend as a pre-entertainment eatery for the cultural district. My husband and I shared the poke aloha specialty roll that was garnished with tuna tartar, which was a touch we both appreciated. We also shared shrimp skewers and scallop pad thai. This is definitely a place to order and share a variety of dishes. The plates we ordered were on the spicy side, so if you're not into spice be cautious. Also, when ordering a martini indicate if you want it very dry. I did not and my drink had too much vermouth for my taste. Would definitely recommend and would definitely come back. Oh, and the decor and dishes are super instagram-worthy!"}
{"text":"szechuan buzz is CRAZY! numbs your mouth and the bourbon wakes it back up. the sushi is very good and a great start to the meal. music and atmosphere is cool and on point. service was good for how busy it was and overall the place is beautiful and a very much needed addition to downtown"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a show at the Benedum on a Sunday afternoon.  I walk past this place quite often on my walks at work during lunch.  I saw the progress of this restaurant when they were building it and I've wanted to check them out since they opened.  I'm glad we stopped by.         We sat at the bar which was by an open area where you're practically sitting outside.  This is within walking distance from the Clemente Bridge so it's a great place to stop at before and after a baseball game in the summer months.         My wife and I enjoyed the atmosphere a lot.  When we come back we will always sit by the open garage door in the warmer months.  The drinks were expensive but that's expected downtown.  We got to look at the menu and it looks like they have a good menu to try out the next time that we stop by.       It wasn't busy so it was surprising that our bartender was preoccupied in other parts of the restaurant.  She was good when she was here but she was busy doing other things when we needed her.  Hopefully it's not like this when they are busy.      The rest of the restaurant looks nice too but you can't beat sitting by the street absorbing the Pittsburgh energy.  Were looking forward to tying their food menu one day soon and getting a few drinks before a Buccos game in the near future.  Stop by and try out this nice new addition to the Burgh!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice, the service was great, and the interior of the restaurant is beautiful. The food, however, is sub-par, and it is certainly not worth the amount of money that you pay for it. One thing that I cannot emphasize enough is: DO NOT COME HERE FOR AUTHENTIC SUSHI. This was the furthest from authentic I have ever seen. (My first clue probably should have been that many of the sushi rolls contained asparagus as an ingredient.) The sushi pieces were very large and had no physical integrity whatsoever. We were provided with chopsticks, which were useless with sushi rolls that immediately disintegrate, and a little container for soy sauce, which was also useless, as the sushi was too big and too fragile to dip inside. The sushi rice was also warm, which is something that I have never experienced before, and I'm pretty sure is not right. Even the appetizers we ordered were disappointing. A pretty presentation and fancy plate does not make up for average, fairly bland food. It was simply not worth the money. Again, if you want something even remotely authentic, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good but the service is spotty! In my six or so visits since opening I find it seems to deteriorate.  In my opinion the service at most Ampd restaurants is generally less than great.   Additionally- if you open at 11, be ready at 11.  The manager who opened the door at 11:05 was far from excited to have customers and generally rude."}
{"text":"We stumbled uponSocial House, really. Other places were booked up, so lacking a reservation, we went in. And boy, were we glad we did!  Tapas is the key,which we love. We wanted to sit at the bar , so we also had the treat of watching the wood fired grill. Our superbly knowledgeable waiter suggested some excellent suggestions, which we took. There are some great local beers on tap as well.  I want to come back with my adventurous friends for a great meal, in a great space--it's decorated superbly as well--kudos to the staff: at least 4 people thanked us on the way out, and it didn't feel like they were from a 'Stepford Wives' remake--just nice folks."}
{"text":"Finally - an Asian restaurant downtown that is not greasy takeout. This place is super trendy from the décor to the food. We came in on a Friday evening and it was very lively - a little TOO lively. The bar area was packed and even started evading into the dining section. If you don't like the sound of drunk people shouting at each other during your meal, this may not be the best place to go for dinner.   I was impressed with their large selection of vegetarian options. I started off with the Green Forest Roll, the only vegetarian roll on the menu. I'm not usually picky with my sushi but this was pretty bland and tasteless. Not something I would recommend. For my main entrée, I ordered the Spicy Tofu. I was very unpleasantly surprised when I found out it didn't come with rice. Such a disappointment. The glaze on the tofu was delicious though - similar to a teriyaki sauce but better. The biggest downside was the amount of oil the vegetables and tofu were drenched it. I would say overall it was a 6/10. For dessert, we had to try the fortune cookie but it definitely looks a lot better than it tastes. The cookie itself was delicious but I was not a fan of the cream filling. Pro tip: fill it with ice cream and it would be a 10/10.  Overall, I'm not too thrilled about this place. Noise level was obnoxious and food was mediocre. It is definitely worth a try if you're downtown, but I don't see myself making a second visit."}
{"text":"I don't understand the appeal.  It's loud so it's tough to be social and the food is mediocre.  We had 4 dishes between us and there isn't one I'd want to order again.  It gets 2 stars instead of 1 because it does have nice atmosphere and the staff was decent."}
{"text":"The food was so good. We have been everywhere in the city but this is 5 stars on anything you order. The best part of the night was Courtney our bartender. She fun, exciting, and kept the night the going for us and made us stay for a fun time with the DJ.... Would recommend this to friends and tell them to ask for Courtney!!"}
{"text":"Just went to Social and sat at the bar on Sunday around 5pm. I wish I knew her name, but I don't...she had a ponytail with an ombre. She w\was very good at making cocktails and we had a great girls' night there. They have an amazing liquor selection and the vibe was great."}
{"text":"I was recently here for dinner last Friday. The ambiance was great. I like the music, lighting, and decor. They have a ton of wait staff who are friendly, so that's nice too.   I'm only giving 3 starts though, because the food was not very good. They offer small plates for sharing, which is fine. Actually the size of the plates were bigger than we expected. Our server recommended 3-4 plates per person, but we could get through half of it. We had the risotto which was undercooked and waaay too salty. The sushi rice was crunchy from either being undercooked or old- either way, disgusting. The flavors were not as described on the menu. For example, the hidden dragon sauce on the chicken was not spicy, but the sauce on the rice cakes was rather hot. I would not recommend the race cakes, btw. Not like a typical rice cake. These things were chewy and gross.   Overall, the best thing we ordered was the brussels sprouts appetizer. The drinks were good too. I'd go back to have the brussels and drinks. Maybe try some desert too since we didn't get any the first time around."}
{"text":"I got a great review about this Sushi Bar from the hotel rep, where I am currently lodging at. I walked in there around 8.05 pm, spoke to a hostess and asked for a takeout menu. This woman said to me, we do not do takeout after 6pm, although I can give you a card to call. Really interesting. Then I said to her, a card for what, she then proceeds to tell me to go to the bar and 'try' to order from there.   This hostess should absolutely either be retrained or FIRED. I travel a lot for work and I know what good customer service/respect is and this hostess has zero of any customer service or respect.  This establishment gets '3' stars, due to the excellent service from the bartender who took my order, apologized for the rude service/lack of service from the hostess.  Also the meal was good, if I ever return to this place, I hope I never see that hostess again, and if I do, I will be asking for her manager to complain about her lack of customer service."}
{"text":"The food is unimpressive (though not bad if you ignore the price).  It becomes a good place to go out at night though.   Basically, view it as a late night bar more than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink before the baseball game. We had been walking around the city and there was really very little to do so why not drink!   We sat at the bar. It was maybe 1:30/2 pm. The bartender gave us our drinks and chatted us up. She was fantastic. She was mid 20's and adventurous. She made a mad drink and kept us there longer than we should have. Service on this day at this bar was perfection.   The food looked great. The menu was nice. The place was huge and clean but the one downer.... there was no-one here. We talked to the bartender about this. She mentioned that they are working on bringing Pittsburgh back and there was an explosion of local restaurants which the city can't really handle at this point. Too many restaurants and not enough people dining at them. Which is bad for business but good as to a person's choices."}
{"text":"I bought the Groupon for lunch and went with a friend. I really liked the decor, dark wood with Asian accent. It was a little dark but nice.  We started with the chee chee brussel sprouts and tuna tartare. The brussel sprouts were good but sadly the best part of this meal.  The tuna was ok fresh rice crackers made it good.  We went with the salmon Pad Thai and the Korean cheese steak. The Pad Thai was bland and the salmon overcooked. The Korean cheese steak which is listed as \"Bulgogi style ribeye, sweet peppers, grilled onions, cheese, Korean BBQ\" . It was dry beef and smothered in Sriracha. It was inedible. I'm not someone who is afraid of spice but this was like a practical joke. I sent it back and got the Bahn Mi. They should not call that weak, bland, unseasoned  sandwich that. It's a insult to Bahn Mi.   I had also bought a Groupon for dinner because I am interested in the Robata. I will never lunch here again but I will try them for dinner."}
{"text":"Just as many others before me, I had high hopes that weren't met.  And it's not necessarily food related.    When we got there, they had a booth set up for four of us.  It was a half circle booth, and it felt a little cramped.  We requested a regular table instead, and were given one, but the hostess was clearly none too pleased to oblige.  She moved us begrudgingly.  Whatever.  So we sat at our table, and our server eventually came over to explain how food will come out when it's ready, not the whole ticket at once.  Ugh.  When I read the reviews, I thought the service just sucked.  But when I heard her say that that's actually how they do it, I was not thrilled.  I mean, I get it, but I don't like it.  I'm not into tapas because of the small portion sizes.  This is not tapas style, as she compared it.  The portions are normal, if not large.  They're just purposely sending out random food at random times.   One cup of soup came out and was the only thing on the table for at least 5 minutes.  Awkward.  Then a salad came out.  Then two more salads.  Then a bowl of edamame.  Then another salad.  Then one plate of sushi.  Then another plate of sushi.  I get that some things will be done before others, but I don't understand why it's difficult to put four salads out on the same ticket at the same time.  Dumb.  Whatever.   Oh, and it also took a ridiculous amount of time to get a cocktail and an iced tea, which also came out at completely different times.  Really...?  And had I known every sushi roll I ordered was going to be just a California roll with a different piece of fish in it, I would have gotten others.  The menu kind of mislead me on that.    Most everything we all got was good, and I really don't have any food complaints.  I would not go all the way downtown again to get that specific experience again, though.  If I were already down there and wanted a California roll, maybe.  But I'll not plan an evening around that restaurant ever again.   AND good luck getting a refill on whatever drink you had.  Neither of us was asked if we wanted another, and my boyfriend's iced tea glass sat empty for the last half of the meal."}
{"text":"I was at SocialHouse last night with 7 of my girlfriends for a bachelorette party. Our server, Sarah, was absolutely incredible. She was extremely attentive, lovely, great personality and was knowledgeable on every question we asked about the drinks, food items, and even some of the ingredients. We never were without water, always had our drinks replenished before they were empty & gave us appropriate suggestions. She's the epitome of an excellent server. Out of the 8 girls in the group last night, all of us have been or are still servers, so we know a good one when we see it! The food was amazing, beautiful and I don't think anyone had one single complaint about anything. I will absolutely return and have another meal here. The setting and atmosphere was lovely. Thank you for the fantastic service, drinks and food!!"}
{"text":"Decor was very well done and cool. Service was also really great, with our friendly server offering food and drink pairing suggestions while never once complaining one bit about splitting the check amongst 7 people.  Food was maybe a 3/5. I wasn't impressed by any of the dishes' presentation, portion sizes, or flavors.  I ordered the Godzilla roll which was fairly large but not big enough to warrant the $17 price tag. Drinks seemed to be on the more expensive side as well, but that could be because we had a large group and split the alcohol tab.   Past 11 pm, a smaller portion of the restaurant turns into a bar/dance floor. Not sure if the kitchen closes at that time but the full bar should keep you well stocked for the night."}
