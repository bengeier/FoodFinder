{"text":"Very nice traditional steakhouse/seafood place I have been going here for years.  Was here recently for a birthday and honestly its really good! I had steak and lobster they were both cooked perfectly. Great bread only one small problem was the caesar salad made at the table didn't blow me away was missing some body and flavour, otherwise great experience and quality food!"}
{"text":"Went to La Castile yesterday after 10 years. Our party of four were extremely happy with all our meals. My peppercorn steak was delicious. The waiters were very classy and professional. They made the whole evening very special for us. Thank you for the great service and making a wonderful evening for us. We also enjoyed the bar and service for before and after dinner drinks :-)."}
{"text":"First time there and i was impressed by the looks of the place.sat down and the bread came out with butter and platter of pickles and more heart attack butter on the plate.we order the chicken breast dish with bake potato.this was the worse food i ever had in my life.garbage!who are they fooling.my buddy order the steak dish! He left everything on the plate.the worse thing about it was the bill! $320.00 dollars.we could of went to the keg for a lot less and hired a dancer too.totally will not recommend."}
{"text":"I love it. The ambiance, service, and of course the food. Taking my boyfriend for his suprise birthday dinner and it was great one.  I give 4 starts only coz of the price. So get your wallet ready."}
{"text":"Food was great. Definitely one of the best lobster bisques I ever had. Well worth the money."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. My boyfriend and I went in the restaurant wearing T-shirts and black pants.  We were greeted by the hostess and informed immediately that there was a dress code.  However, we could go to the bar area where they have a full menu plus a special menu for those not allowed in the main area. The hostess said no hats allowed. My boyfriend took off his cap. Unfortunately it seems like we are still not looking good enough to get an average service.   I don't know how they make the judgement call because they don't post the dress code at the door. Also we just saw a few people standing just outside of the restaurant in shorts having a smoke break but seemingly they look \"high end\" enough; while we were wearing long black pants (at least we weren't wearing shorts and flip-flops).  We were told to sit down in what appeared to be the back of the bar where the furniture was stacked up and wait for the waitress.  The hostess did not take us to the table nor give us menus to look at.  We waited for almost 10 minutes before we decided to leave.  On our way out the waitress finally had our menus for us, but by this time frustration and hunger took over and we decided on trying another restaurant.  We felt very uncomfortable and unwanted there.  We told her we actually decided to leave but she did not ask us if there's anything wrong with the place or the service.  I might be wrong but I think that if we were to pay for at least $60-70 for dinner, we expect service to be at least semi-descent. Who would want to pay that price to be treated as a second class/abandoned customers?  Finally we are glad that we end up switching to a burger place for dinner. We get respect, dignity and better service at a burger joint. I will never attempt to dress up to come back to this place."}
{"text":"The first time I came to La Castille I thought I had gone back in time.  You don't find many places like this anymore!  I thoroughly enjoy the over-the-top decor, the old-fashioned grumpy waiters who all look alike; all drive the same black cadillac and all wear black tuxedos.  I like the tray of pickles and cottage cheese (even though I don't eat either of them.)  I LOVE the huge amount of garlic in the garlic bread.  I've never been disppointed with the food.  One of the great fun things to do at La Castile is to grab a drink in the piano bar.  Especially when there is entertainment.  Sometimes it is a great little jazz singer, and sometimes it is someone doing their best lounge-singer imitation.  Either way, it is classic.   There are other steakhouses that are more polished; more delicous and more elegant.  But very few top La Castile for an experience.  I will keep going.  You should, too."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, excellent for special occasions.   The atmosphere is outstanding, I entertain out of town business clients here for dinner... everyone has always loved it.  The menu is extensive, the prices are a little higher than the Keg... but the quality of the food is outstanding. The portions are a little cheap on some menu items.  My typical dinner for 3 people with 2 starters, 3 dinners and 1 drink each plus a bottle of wine... typically come to $250 including 20% tip. Expect to pay $150 for a couple if you have a few drinks with your dinner.  Overall, worth a try for a newbie. I will continue to eat here, mainly for business since the price point isn't my typical friday out with my wife :)"}
{"text":"We went here last night for Valentine's Day. My boyfriend made the reservation and it was a surprise so I didn't know we were coming here.   I had read reviews and heard from people that the food was bland and overpriced and I must say, I completely agree. I had steak and scallops. The steak was not seasoned well (if at all?) and overcooked. It basically tasted like it had salt and pepper on it. The scallops were just bland. On the plus side, it's a lot of food. On the other hand, I really didn't care to finish such a mediocre meal. My boyfriend had steak and lobster. The steak was cooked fine but bland. The lobster was very bland and rubbery. Maybe the Valentine's day rush had them frazzled but at over $200 for 2 people, it's not an excuse.  They give you butter, pickles and ... cottage cheese with the bread. Not sure why the cottage cheese but just a heads up.  The decor was ok. Looked like a castle and all that but there were way too many tables cramped together. The staff was friendly, but that alone is not going to make me ever revisit this place."}
{"text":"Was visiting Toronto and checked out La Castile. On a Wednesday night, it was packed - which is always a good sign. Ended up having dinner in the lounge.  Had veal chops which were absolutely superb. Was a solo that night, so can't comment on what others in my party had, but I was very pleased.  Will come back on my next GTA trip ..."}
{"text":"Very elegant and classy restaurant. Steaks are very good, well prepared and wine selection is something to please many. Appetizers are delicious making you doubt to ask for steak or get more of them. Service on point and effective. Will go back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first visit to La Castile a lot. The place takes you back in time , a classic, warmth and elegant atmosphere adding to that is a family friendly .The staff are very attentive. Meal size is massive . Little bit pricey but worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"Just entering the parking lot gives you the impression that this place is unique. Referred by a friend, this landmark restaurant didn't disappoint.   Visuals and atmosphere were great. The building, it's decor and large chairs gave us lots to check out.   Good wine selection, food was cooked perfectly. We had the rib eye and steak Neptune with salads. The Caesar salad was extremely tasty. The steaks were as ordered.   We enjoyed dinner the only dissatisfaction was lack of Creme Brule on the dessert menu."}
{"text":"We walked in with reservations and felt a little uneasy the way how we were greeted.  The staff looked at us as if we do not belong in this resturant or plan on running before the bill arrives!  I swear that was the impression we got.  Anyways on our way to the table we noticed there were 2 levels.  We were seated at the lower level.  Overall the resturant carried a warm ambiance.  Our waiter was a bit stush - no smiles, just nutural.  The bread on the table was cold and I've had alot better.  We ordered the steak and fish.  Hands down the food tasted good.  One problem, we always had to flag down our waiter to get service.  I would go back but I wish we are not judge on how we look to get service."}
{"text":"Great food and wine.  Expensive.  The ambience is very romantic.  Music and piano bar is lovely.  My husband wish he was served real cut carrots ratter than carrots out of a bag.  Veggies (broccoli and asparagus were under cooked.  Server wasn't the most happiest gentleman.  Mumbled a lot.  I would return for food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The most beautiful steakhouse I've seen in Canada . Great selections of wine and very unique appetizer menu. The service was not very good . We were not  assigned a server and every 20 minutes , new staff member would come and check up on us .i would say the steak and the condiments were better than the usual \"keg\" but it was not worth the money we paid for .I would not go back ."}
{"text":"Amazing Kobe steak for a reasonable price.  Definitley a great place to bring a date if you really want to impress her.  It can get a bit expensive, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"They stick to what they know and they execute it well. Outstanding dining room, piano bar and patio (slightly noisy).  Irrespective of the prevailing food trends or fashion, they serve steaks and seafood \"old school\" style. The servers are professional, fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely recommend this place. This is great venue for that special anniversary or birthday. The decor and ambience speak for itself. My favorite items are the seafood platter, the garlic bread and the best ceasar salad you will ever have!  I am giving it a 4 stars because the only thing it is lacking is some customer service. The waiters are a bit snobbish and rush you out the door so they can serve the next table.   I am so glad that I live close by to this Mississauga Gem!"}
{"text":"Superb. Had a very nice filet, cooked as I had asked (medium-well) and a very nice port to finish. It's not an inexpensive place, but well worth the money in my opinion."}
{"text":"The ambiance and decor is very old english mixed with french. The food however is ok- it's not great. It's good.The service was ok - it was a full house that night and they were a bit slow. Understandably, but they should staff more people then. The menu is basic stuff sometimes with a twist - steak and fries with veggies sort of stuff. They do have a piano bar that looked great for drinks."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, great dining room and piano bar, the best steaks ever but lousy tiramisu, which was tasteless and watery nothing like real tiramisu.."}
{"text":"10 of us went to La Castile, started out ok. Beverage service was good, food service was weak. Everyone's veggies were cold and to get toppings for a baked potato was a challenge. The appetizers were good as were the steaks, not a total bad experience."}
{"text":"Great place, I am a business traveler, always looking for a good place where I can eat at the bar, talk with the bar tender ect.. Food was excellent and lots of it, I had the steak and scallops and could not finish my dinner. Salad, veg and potato all included. Great wine list, friendly atmosphere and close to the airport hotel section."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous time there Saturday night.  The appetizers, salads, and entree's were wonderful.  The portions are huge.  The roast beef melted in your mouth and the rib steak was perfect.  Our server (Mike) was so charming.  compared to the steakhouses that we go to downtown Toronto, the prices were much better - as well as the atmosphere.  I just wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"The Castile has always had the atmosphere of a large castle (fake) but fun to fantasize.  But the food and the prices are no joke and I suggest that if you are not in the habit of paying big bucks for so-so food, then stay away.  What this place needs is a creative chef who can turn out dishes that are fresh, creative, and delicious so that paying the bill is for memorable dining. Toronto is too sophisticated to settle for this ho-hum dining."}
{"text":"I went for a couples anniversary and had heard nothing but the best from this restaurant as treating their customers like royalty (considering the prices you pay $$$$$).  We were seated upstairs in a deep pocket corner right next to the bus boy section and every 5 minutes i was reluctant to get my chair pushed in from a waiter walking by. It got to the point where I had to ask them to find an alternate route before my face ended up in my plate of food.  After we ordered dinner it took an EXCEPTIONALLY long period of time for the food to arrive, tables that had arrived after us had gotten meals before us. Once it did arrive (I ordered a medium 7oz filet mignon) my order was wrong to begin with they had given me the larger filet mignon that I had not asked for and when i cut down the middle it was purple, absolutely raw purple. 10 minutes later trying to flag down the (rude) waiter to send it back, to come back again still raw.... I expect a place that charges $50 a plate to know how to cook food.  I did not touch my meat, to later be disgusted by some sad display of boiled vegetables on the side... and by display i mean 2 asparagus, 1 cauliflower, and a couple peppers.  I took my food to go, only to feed it to my neighbors dog the next day, at least he enjoyed it.   Not going back."}
{"text":"Came here on a few special occasions over the years and you just can't go wrong. Great food, great steak, and fair prices. I always order the seafood platter... its huge and delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here on numerous occasions for the past 10 years and I would say that the quality of food has remained consistent.   This time around, my fiancé and I made reservations to celebrate our engagement. We were expecting to be seated in a nicer area, but were placed right by the corner near a cold vent.   We ordered the escargot as a starter and both got the filet mignon oscar. I really like how big the crab meat chunks were!!!  They then gave us a complimentary chocolate cake to celebrate our engagement.   The 1 star lost is due to service-- why do they seem emotionless all the time?!"}
{"text":"Great steakhouse.   I was picked up at the airport by two old friends. Then we went for steak in memory of our fallen comrades George & Howard as rememberance day approaches.  We arrived early for happy hour following a well dressed couple. After viewing the Harry Potter like architecture, we settled on a semi private room overlooking the bar and Juliette room. Fantastic views.  Plenty of beers on tap both domestic and imported.  Garlic bread and huge pickles enthused our appetites.    With the Breeders Cup in the background and the forefront of our minds we chatted with our lovely server who took care of our needs and wants. New York steak, filet mignon and pepper steak with extra sauce were great.  Our horse didn't win the race we certainly did with our dinner experience."}
{"text":"Great value in a classic steakhouse setting, when you want something better then the Keg but not go overboard on a $300 dinner for two."}
{"text":"What can I say? La Castile is still phenomenal. I've been going there ever since I was a little smurf but I haven't been in a decade. I took wifey and Mumsy in Law on a whim and I was a little nervous since it was their first time there and I'd been touting it for ages.  Well everything was perfect, as I remember it. The food was fantastic, (highlights were the steak, the full-sour pickles and the amazing Caesar salad). We found the service to be impeccable. Very attentive and NEVER overbearing or snooty as described in others' reviews.  If anything, go for the ambiance. It's really hard to beat the old-school, majestic feel of this place. Huge chandeliers, incredible amounts of wood and multi-levels truly do make you feel as though you're in a castle.  Two slight, slight reasons that I didn't give it 5 stars?  The lobster tail was slightly overcooked and chewy (perhaps because it was so big?) and the place is a geriatric magnet. At least, for that reason, it's quiet!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I had a steak that was thick, juicy and cooked properly that it even retained every ounce of flavour.  I ordered the New York Peppercorn cooked medium-rare and it was fantastic.  I admit the price is high but the taste is still engrained in my head that I quickly forgot it was $40-something.  The fries (as my side dish) were also thick cut and it almost looked like it came from a single fresh potato - but I'm not entirely sure about that.  The service was almost too \"professional\" and \"pretentious\" that we actually felt rather distant and disconnected from the service.  This is not meant to be a complaint, but perhaps I am accustomed to having small conversations with the wait-staff just to make the experience more personable.  They were almost \"invisible\" as they made the salad off to the side, different waiters would drop bread and food off quickly, and only one person asking if everything is alright.  If you were specifically looking for this type of service, then they did a fantastic job being transparent.  Perhaps this may be the same reason why other Yelp reviewers felt the service was lacking / rushing?  We certainly did not feel rushed because we were the only people sitting in the main floor area with so many vacant tables!  4 Stars for great food and respectable service, but the price structure limits my visits to come only on special occasions.  This place definitely attracts the more mature crowd judging by the type of vehicles in the parking lot, and how well dressed the mature ladies and gentlemen are.  Almost reminds me of a James Bond gala.  Oh and yes, on the way out of the place, we saw a mature couple making out by a Mercedes convertible.  Unless my drink was extra spiked, they had to be 55+."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious.  Too bad I can't rave about the waiters. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!! The worst waiters in a restaurant. I have gotten better service at a mom and pop's shop!! Empty beer bottles left on the table until you ask to take it away. After eating plates still left on the table until you ask for them to be removed!!!! With the fancy schmansy enviroment and prices these zombies should be literally be waiting at your table hand and foot!!! Bills for 3 people running around $200 for just food? Come on!! They are getting no tips from us!!! But yes, if you want a good steak they do a great job, i'll give them that.  Maybe next time take out."}
{"text":"I've been to A LOT of steak houses in the past few months and have been disappointed with the cook on my steaks...La Castile broke the record!!  OMG! I had my steak medium rare and it sure did come out that way!! So tender and juicy!    I ordered escargot (yummy! But not that big), lobster bisque (AMAZINGG!!!), steak neptune (cooked to perfection, juicy, topped with REAL crab meat, asparagus and hollandaise).  My mouth is still watering thinking about the food I had last night...lol  The service is on point with gentlemen who walk you to your seat and kindly push your seat in when sitting.  Each server was friendly, polite and you don't see service like that anymore.  La Castile has a mature and old school feel, which is probably the next best thing to their quality and taste of food.   Hopefully next time I go back will be for date night!  I can't wait to go back!!  Don't forget to dress nicely!"}
{"text":"The place is marvelous when it comes to the design , atmosphere & service, food: they need to reconsider it again. We paid $230 for $50 worth of food..was not up to my expectation taste wise nor presentation."}
{"text":"As a steakhouse you can't go wrong, food was fantastic, however sadly that is where the accolades stop. Service was no where near the class this restaurant commands and deserves. I rated this a three only because the food was a five but the service was between a zero and one.  Strongly suggest the owners refresh the waiters with an influx of personnel that can serve the clients this restaurant caters to."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was just OK for the quality of restaurant. The food was expensive and for the same price you could dine at other high end restaurants. Let me say that I heard amazing things about this place and it was my in-laws go to place for high end dining. I liked the decor and everything was presentable which created the perception of high end dining. I would recommend to go at least once to try and definitely a great spot for special occasions."}
{"text":"What a place.  Its a bit expensive so we cant go there all the time, but as a group of 5 we enjoyed this high end old school posh restaurant.  Our reservation was at 6:30 and we were seated almost immediately by a very courteous and attentive host, and fussed over by a team of excellent professional wait staff.  This was truly a great culinary adventure because we were celebrating my fathers birthday, so this just added to a special night for all of us.  The menu is very diversified and there is something for everyone.  Starting with the complimentary appetizers, brought to the table which include garlic bread, pickles and cottage cheese, everything was fresh and the flavors were strong and outstanding.  Mmmm the garlic, gotta love it and its great for vampire repellent too.  Dual purpose appetizers always float my boat.  Moving on to the salads, they were good, but when you go to a steak house the salad isnt the main event, as the late John Pinette once said, \"salad is the promise that real food is coming\".  And that it did.  Large juicy portions of prime rib for the parents, cooked to perfection.  Its been a while since i have seen such attractive plates with grilled veggies on the side and a slab of cow that would make native Albertans proud.  Dont forget the baked potato on the side slathered in sour cream.  This made for some happy parents to have this meal bestowed upon them.  For the wife, she had the Steak Neptune, again cooked to perfection and topped with seafood and a lovely Hollandaise sauce with beautiful seasonal veggies on the side.  My son decided to be adventurous and try something new to him and picked the penne pasta topped with tomato sauce and grilled chicken.  Now, i have to say, when you are at a steak house, pasta does not even register with me.  However, once you try this, you will change your mind.  He loved it and it was cooked to perfection.  I had to try a sample of it just to see for myself and this dish is a winner.  The sauce was tangy and permeated with parmigiana cheese, the pasta cooked perfectly, and the sear on the chicken was perfect and yet so tender and juicy inside i may have to take a crack at this myself one day.  For myself, i had the Filet Mignon.  Once again they outdid themselves with this thick tender steak wrapped in bacon.  The sear was perfect and the lovely pink medium was spot on to my taste.  The veggies on the side, especially the red pepper just added to the experience which was topped off with a baked potato.  If you think thats it, well, there was also desert.  Now i myself did not take part in the desert menu, I was more than satisfied with the portions and the samples of others around me so i had to opt out, but I will say, the various deserts around the table were polished off with rave reviews from my fellow diners.  Next time i will have to save room for desert knowing that i may have missed out on something special.  Although its high end and expensive, you will want to treat yourself here for that special occaision when you want some over the top classy service and above average food.  5 stars is not enough for this place.  Thank you Ana, and Happy 72'nd Birthday Dad"}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant as I was asked to join last minute for my mothers birthday with her golfing buddies.  The atmorsphere and decor of this castle style restaurant was unique and screamed olden day royalty. My mothers friend suggested that we ordered their seafood platter plate so we ordered that, I believe it was labelled as Le Castile platter for two...this was definitely an exceptional plate. Not only was it a seafood galore, you also got a filet mignon with it as well....my only comment is, that plate could of fed all four of us. We had to pack up more than half of our order. btw, i loved their bake potato and sour cream!!!! If you guys were wondering, the dish cost $145."}
{"text":"I was taken here for Valentines Day 2014.   I will try not to make this a lengthy review of the events leading up to this meal, and I will attempt to be thorough.  I was told the only reservation available for Vday was 6:30 by my date, so it was already tough getting there this early. I was already disgruntled with this fact.  However, I drove down this strip of Dundas between the 427 and Dixie, and thought, how could there be a great restaurant here? It is situated at the end of a row of hour motels and independent car dealerships - and a strip club.  I parked (plentiful parking) and walked in. Very warm service upon arrival. Free coat check. Hosts and hostesses were kind, flattering. I was the last to arrive of a table of 4, was walked to the table.   This restaurant is an architectural palace. I do believe it is an old castle or mansion.  2, or 3 if included half floors of beautiful candle lit, tables. We had a table right beside the fireplace in a private nook, beside the stairs.   I think wherever you sit at this restaurant you will be satisfied with the distance from other tables.   Now on to the important part: the food! The wine list was great and well priced. We had a bottle of Cab Sauv. Our table ordered everything from steak, to chicken, mussels and lobster. All the food was great. I had the chicken Neptune, because I love Neptune salad(seafood salad). So it was absolutely amazing they had the chicken sliced open with the salad inside, covered in a light and not overpowering hollandaise sauce with asparagus.   The presentation was fabulous. I loved this restaurant. I was really tired so I was not able to enjoy the experience to the fullest but I will return.  It is pricey but I would say so worth it! I thought I may not enjoy this restaurant as it is very old money and not hip or cutting edge and not creative - but I must say it was classic beauty and charm and tried and tested foods that work. I can definitely appreciate that."}
{"text":"This dining experience was one of the best I've ever had.  the food was beyond my expectations as well as the service.  the list of superlatives I could use would fill this comment window. The dining room is like a castle - how many giant oak trees had to die to make these beams? their sacrifice was well worth it.  if you ever have the opportunity go eat here and treat yourself and someone you care about to an amazing meal."}
{"text":"This is an excellent traditional up scale restaurant. The ambiance is very good, with low lighting and heavy dark furnishings and crisp white table linens giving on old world feel. The wait staff are properly attired and well trained, balancing a friendly informal attitude with the traditional more formal style. Service is unhurried and the portions generous. The escargot were superb, as was the garlic bread. The shrimp cocktail looked amazing and was well prepared. Salads were freshly prepared and all the dressings we tried were tasty and obviously made in house. For our entrees we tried the strip loin, the filet mignon and the steak Neptune, washed down with a dash of Chianti from the extensive wine list. The steaks were cooked as ordered and the filet mignon was blue and full of flavour. I recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to recapture the traditional dining style and push the boat out a bit. It is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and myself have been going to La Castile for a few years now. We love the warm and friendly atmosphere where everyone almost knows everybody else.  It feels like the customers went to school together!  The food never failed us. The music is like no other place especially for the +60 nostalgics clientele like myself.  The musician sings in a few languages and is very obliging where special requests are concerned! Our favourite place ever and will continue going there!  Hala and Nadia"}
{"text":"Authentic steakhouse. Vintage. Been coming here for years. Top quality food. My favourite dish is the ribeye bone in with thick cut fries. Excellent!"}
{"text":"The steak was seasoned and cooked well, however, it was 40% fat. Fries were good. Salad was terrible. What really made the night a disappointment that could have been recovered was our waiter. He clearly had no interest in anything, despite seeing we were not eating much, especially the rock hard vegetables. The only time he smiled was when he gave us the bill. We enjoy a fine dining experience and we pay well for it, this fell short."}
{"text":"Interesting ambiance for for sure - definitely feel like you have walked into a time warp.  One note - this place is huge.  Wait staff is excellent.  Food is done remarkable well.  Will probably come back for special occasions since we live right down the road."}
{"text":"So I am sure everyone has either heard of this place and or driven by it.  You cant miss it as you are driving by it and you see the fire burning lanterns surrounding the place.  Finally after sooo many years of wanting to try the food here I had the chance.  When you walk in you are greeted immediately with out wasting any time.  My first impression of this place was WOW its super fancy.  Its castle like décor, dim lighting, and all staff in tuxedos made me feel like I was being treated like royalty.  Service was top notch hands down.  As soon as we were settled in a basket of garlic bread and a platter of pickles, olives and feta cheese were brought to our table.  A perfect little snack to get the evening started.  As apps we shared an order of fried calamari and Caesar salad.  Typical app's.  For my main course I chose to go with the Prime Rib.  When it arrived my eyes popped out of my head it was 25oz of goodness.  Thick, juicy and cooked to perfection.  Melted in my mouth.  I would not have changed a thing about this.  I will warn everyone this is not the cheapest meal that you will have so don't expect a deal here.  Although I must say its worth every penny."}
{"text":"Great food if only the service could match.   I always order a 16 oz filet mignon, which is not on the menu but is made for me nonetheless, the filet is always great and the peppercorn sauce which I order on the side quite simply makes the meat melt in your mouth.   You are doing youself a disservice if you eat beef and dont try the filet mignon.  My family loves to order the seafood platter with a filet which is the main reason we keep coming back on special occassions.  I have been here over 10 times and have always had iffy service times not sure if I am just unlucky or the wrong colour for the great service other yelpers have identified.   Either way I will continue to be a patron despite the slow service.   If you are decding between here and any chain steakhouse than pay the extra $5-$10 and try La Castile"}
{"text":"Went back this year to organize a birthday. Came earlier than the party, was welcome by a younger female manager, very professional. She offered to take my jacket, flowers and presents. I was given an older woman (downstairs level/bar area) as the waitress.   My party was arriving and told me to order drinks and salads for to be ready by the time before arrival. I asked this older lady which cognac they have and what she suggests for the male guests. She gave me attitude and replied back \"well which one would you like - we have the standard brands\" without listing them, I ignored this and asked to order 7 salads to get prepared now  before the party arrives she replied \"we can't do that, the salads should be ordered when your guests arrive\". I'm sorry I'm paying for 7 people and I'm not allowed to order what I want. She agreed in the end.  My party arrived, everyone ordered drinks, the same female waiter, forgot 1 salad, the whole party expect 1 male for their drinks and we had to wave her down waited another 10 mins and nothing. In the end the male of the party spoke with the female manager to switch waiters, we received an amazing waiter named Tony, amazing service with him! Food was cooked to basic (read prior review) same as before. They need to fire this woman."}
{"text":"Group dinner.   I think people come here more the \"classic\" feel to the kind of service they offer. The food was good, not amazing. LARGE portions so be warned.   The building is really interesting and something to really appreciate though."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in the world.  I have been to many steak houses in the U.S. and Canada and this one takes the grand prize.  It may have something to do with a family tradition, the Langdons have been coming here for three generations.  I live in California but every time I am home I always try to make it hear for a meal with my father.  The minute you walk up and open the large heavy wooden door you know your in for a trip back in time.  There is a coat check area in the very front, and a nice elegant piano bar to the left.  The old wooden traditional style is what makes La Castile so special.  From the hand carved wooden raining beams to the oversized chandeliers, this place exudes elegance.    Every time I go here I get the steak and lobster which is amazing, the clarified butter that they bring out with its own personal heating candle underneath adds a nice touch.  The dinner is quite expensive but it is worth it.  Also if you like caesar salad this is the place to have one. They bring out all of the ingredients and make it right at your table!    Some other reviews said that the service is not good, but I have never had a bad experience.  It is a very old service style and restaurant and if your not used to that you may not enjoy the experience.    Overall I would highly recommend if you are anywhere near the GTA."}
{"text":"My mom and step-dad took myself, the BF, and my nephew out to dinner here for my 30th birthday last week and we had a really great time!  It feels like a time warp stepping into this place, check out the interior and you know what I mean ;) I love how they provide the table with a plate of pickles, cottage cheese, and little balls of butter along with a basket of garlic bread.  For my ginormous meal, I ordered escargots, french onion soup, filet mignon, creme brulee cheesecake, all washed down with a flaming boozy Monte Cristo dessert coffee.   I enjoyed dipping the already butter soaked garlic bread into the juices left on the plate from the succulent escargot. The french onion soup was very flavourful and chock full of cheesy goodness. My filet mignon was a bit undercooked but I don't mind a bit more red in my steak anyway (and it tasted scrumptious) so I didn't bother to send it back. The waiters sang happy birthday to me and I enjoyed my cheesecake very much, it was very tasty!  Pro tip : order a fancy coffee like the Monte Cristo; the waiter does the whole thing table side, including lighting things on fire and dumping copious amounts of whipped cream into the glass - OMG! trust me, its worth it!  By the end of the evening my birthday dress was pretty much bursting at the seams! Good times!!  It's fun to get dressed up and come here on a \"fancier\" night. Service is always excellent and attentive. Huge portions and awesome old school high class dinner!"}
{"text":"Very nice stained glass old church. Bar next to piano player and dance floor. Many levels of intimate space. Open air feeling cozy. Polite informed waiters. Need reservations. Fast service. Relaxed environment. Enjoyed every moment. Compared to Moishes Montreal. I would return."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding. I've tried several of the \"eilte\" steakhouses in the city at least once over the years and La Castile is among the best of the best. The food is perfectly delicious and prepared to perfection. The service, as one might expect, is exceptional. It goes without saying however that it all comes at a premium price, but for a special occasion, it doesn't get more special than La Castile."}
{"text":"What an incredible interior. A throwback design you won't see ever built again. They have a lounge, bar area, plus a beautiful more formal section.  Chicken Caesar salad is excellent. Loved the entire experience."}
{"text":"So let's start by saying most of the people have it right. The food is great , But service is Terrible . Even though I dress well , I guess tattoos make you not want to feed me ! Oh well at the end of night I made sure to throw a nice nice tip down and left a note with the extra $100 tip saying for etiquette classes . Money comes and goes ...but remember treat people as you wish to be treated as well . Anyways go for the food ..not the service,  which is sad to say in such a beutiful restaurant .  Oh this is a impress your lady type place . Just keep your cool with the staff haha makes you look more classy ."}
{"text":"Great steaks and wine! Try the French onion soup to start. Ambiance is games of thrones and vintage inspired"}
{"text":"The portions were really good. And they had great service. The steaks where good, not great. The lobster bisque was not good at all."}
{"text":"Easily one of the finest steakhouses in the GTA.  Consistently amazing food quality, service and world class experience. The staff are highly skilled in the old world art of fine dining and go the extra mile to make your experience memorable and special.  The steaks are always prepared to perfection. I've been here at least 10 times and I've never been disappointed.  You will not go wrong with La Castile. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"LA castile is definitely a hidden gem in the west end. I've driven past it regularly and never would have thought about cbecking it out until a friend suggested to check it out based on their reviews. I was in love... the building is really old and apparently it's one of toronto oldest restaurants, the service was great! Everyone was so friendly and you could tell the servers have all been their for years because by here weren't many young servers. The seafood platter &steak platter was delicious but it's alot of food! So go in really hungry!  I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I prefer the bar side - it's cheaper and is the same food they serve in the high priced restaurant side. Service is mediocre however the food and steaks are outstanding.  Great clubby atmosphere and they have a wonderful patio that begs to be enjoyed"}
{"text":"This place is all about ambiance.  The restaurant is huge, seats about 400, but it is divided into many small rooms which are linked by narrow halls so you never get the sense of immenseness you get from other large restaurants.  It's dark and private (think dark mahogany wall paneling).  We dined with friends in a small room off the dance floor and piano bar which was ideal because we got to request music from the piano player and to dance.  Clientele on this Saturday night was generally on the old side (my buddy referred to the blue-hairs there)  I'm not going to say anything about the service other than to say it was not memorable (repeated requests for basic things such as water, bread, etc.)  The menu offers basic steakhouse options - meat & seafood.  Food quality was OK.  The acceptable champagne, my wife's thing, was waaaaaaaaaay over priced so we did what most obnoxious Americans would do ... ordered vodka martinis.  They got mine right on the second try (does that make me a snob? Hmmm.)  Great for a date.  Great for privacy.  Great for conversation with friends.  Good for dancing.  You won't go hungry here, but brace yourself when it comes to service quality."}
{"text":"I went here with my fiancé.   She started with the French onion soup and I had the lobster bisque. Both were very good.   We both had the Neptune steak for our main. It was good but nothing to rave about. I probably could have made the same thing, if not better at home.   The building is beautiful but the service not so much. We had two servers. The server who provided our drinks was great. He was very talkative and took the opportunity to get to know us. The food server was more interested in the group gatherings around our table. The only time he engaged us in conversation was when he brought our bill."}
{"text":"Well past its best before date.  Roast beef, big and blah, steaks overdone, good salad, waiters couldn't care less, perfunctory.  Very inattentive.  Place was very cold, 2 of my guests put on their winter jackets to keep warm.  Waiter smiled when we told him it was too cold. When we made reservations, clerk was advised of a very special occasion - 80th birthday celebration.  \"We will make it special\"  Nada, nothing, zilch Place may have been OK 30 years ago, but even the Keg does a better job Won't go back"}
{"text":"I've been to several Steakhouses in my life and this has been the best so far.   I went to this places to celebrate my mothers birthday, as was my first time I obviously didn't know what to expect, the only thing I had to guide me were the reviews I had read and as reviews usually are, they were mixed which help much sometimes.   Upon entering we were seated right away (we did have a reservation), but they weren't busy anyways. A little while later server came and took our drink orders and then gave us sometime to pick our appetizers and mains.  I ordered a French Onion Soup as my appetizer and a Peppercorn Steak Chicago Style Medium Well with a side of fries as my main. The soup and steak were honestly the best I've ever had. The soup tastes extremely fresh and wasn't salty like other French Onion Soups I've had. The Steak was amazing and charred to perfection.   The service was even better; we had 3 separate servers attending to us which was quite nice and much different to the other Steak Houses and Restaurants I've been to.  I should also add that they even sung the \"Happy Birthday\" song to my mom which was cool since you don't really see that too often in \"fancy restaurants\".   I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to enjoy a nice Steak or to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"\"Time for an upgrade\"  La Castile has been at the 427 and Dundas for many years. It's a classic restaurant with tuxedoed waiters and heavy chairs. It caters primarily to an older, upper class (who else would pay $38 for a piece of halibut on a patio on Dundas St) and those wanting to get some more use out of their formal wear they bought for their last wedding.  Having never sat on the patio, I had to smile as we sat down to the reverb-filled sound of half DJ half live performance with cars whizzing by on Dundas. Within a few seconds of sitting down, my date and I (but mostly my date) attracted stares from 6 women at an adjacent table. I smiled because their look was like \"finally something else to look at rather than the people on the dance floor\".  I don't have really anything bad to say about La Castile. The service and the food are both good but I feel the value is just not there. I remember those times when the shrimp were as big as my arm and the food was slathered in oil and butter, but diets have changed over the years and I don't think La Castile has noticed. We are served a basket of white toasted bread drowning in butter and garlic. And I'm sure many there would have eaten the whole basket and asked for seconds.  The halibut and salmon we ordered were soaking in a rich, buttery oil and the salads were kind of bland. They use very simple ingredients that seem to involve too much salt and not enough herbs. And the portions are big.  Some people would think that if they can dine at La Castile they have made it! That seems to be what the crowd there exudes. I'm sure that for many people La Castile is a great restaurant. I'm not sure anyone under the age of 50 would think so."}
{"text":"Outstanding dinner.  Filet cooked to perfection and nicely seasoned.  I'd stack it up against a Hy's any day of the week.  All the things that bothered me last time have changed back.  Nicely done."}
{"text":"We went there with another couple on Valentine's weekend. Everything went absolutely flawlessly from reservation to coat check to menu to everything! All 4 of us walked in there with high expectations and the staff at the restaurant definitely exceeded them. Keep it up La Castile!"}
{"text":"Let me first say that I do not frequent many establishments at this price point I truthfully almost avoid them as most of the time I do feel it's a waste of money.... However this place was truly worth the bill!  I have driven by this place literally a hundred times before and although the flaming sconces outside did intrigue me it wasn't enough to entice me to venture in. The almost gated community feel does lend to the ambiance of the place and they have of course a private parking lot with ample parking. I find the decor here to be on the traditional side with lots of rich wood finishes and molding; it gives a slightly more intimate and refined feel with dim lighting and plenty of decorative details.The venue is rather large but with the space divided into areas with plenty of cozy little nooks to inhabit.  The seating is comfortable with spacious tables and plenty of seating options ranging from quaint smaller tables to large, extravagant booths. In house entertainment was there while I dined though I am unsure of the regular schedule in regards to this aspect... None the less the pianist was fabulous and quite the vocal artist as well playing several convincing covers and some original works as well.  The menu is concise and although the price points are quite high I will say that the quality of food and service make it more feasible then you would think. Now I am nowhere near rich... Even comfy to be perfectly honest so a place like this is indeed a rare treat for me but even though I don't have the money to burn I still don't feel like it's a waste here.  Let me first mention the caliber of service which is A++ as they more then surpassed my customer service expectations. They always remember repeat guests, they go out of their way to provide a specially tailored experience and go above and beyond to make new comers want to return. They truly enhance the experience and make excellent menu suggestions.  The food is absolutely to die for .... The quality is definitely noticeably better then some of the best steak houses I have been to. The fresh shrimp cocktail is comprised of ginormous succulent shrimp with almost sweet meat I can't even describe it to you but def worth a try if your a seafood lover. The small antipasto appetizer of cheese and  olives is delicious enough and I find it to be a great, light snack while you wait for you meal. The wine list is extensive and truthfully I can't even remember what I had but it was a delicious red our waiter had recommended. The steak  I ordered literally melted in my mouth... No chewing is required I mean it was that tasty! Really I have always had steak as a basic staple in my life, not as much now but def growing up so I am no stranger to a good steak. BUT this steak was a WHOLE OTHER LEVEL kind of steak and truly changes your perception of it entirely.  Even after the hefty bill reaches you the fabulousness of the entire experience dilutes the shock of it some.  So if your a meat or seafood lover and you don't mind splurging a bit I do highly suggest venturing past the glowing sconces of the front gates of Le Castille I don't think you'll be disappointed"}
{"text":"A beautifully decorated steakhouse with high quality interior finishes. Almost all 4 stars are given to the ambience and environment.   I went with a part of 8 and the service was quite good. The food quality was fair but not exceptional. Pricing is also fair.  I'd definitely recommend this place to bring a guest or a date, the setting is totally worth the price. I can't say I'd be a regular customer but you should try it at least once."}
{"text":"Currently my favourite steakhouse and I haven't even tried the steak yet. The good meat is a bit on the pricier side but well worth it. $44 lambchops were unbelievable and accompanied perfectly with a side of mint jelly. The free cottage cheese and pickles appetizer is a good way to begin your night. Yum"}
{"text":"This isn't a place you come often, but dream about for that once a year special treat. It's plenty expensive and the ambiance is cheeseball, but it's a great place to impress someone who's never been there. Great family place or date spot if you REALLY like the person. Great food too. Never had a bad scallop or piece of meat, and the shrimp I swear ate the size of a lobster tail. Massive!!!!"}
{"text":"The food servings are huge! It was cooked to order, good service and a beautiful place inside. Only negative is no kids menu, so they charge full price for food they cannot possibly finish."}
{"text":"Do you recall those polar bear bodyguards from Zootopia? Tall, dressed in black, with a deep voice, waiters at La Castile reminded me of those bodyguards from Zootopia, lol. The best part was when they brought out a piece of chocolate cake and sang Happy Birthday Song! in their polar bear deep voices. I had to resist bursting out in a loud laughter.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at La Castile thanks to these polar bear waiters though the service felt a bit slow at times. The food was great; I had Steak Neptune. It was a bit salty and the mix of crab meat and the steak wasn't as mind-blowing as I expected it would be. I would say it was delicious but I've had better steaks elsewhere. I liked the escargots. They were cooked perfectly. The salad was very fresh as well. This place would be awesome for date nights and special occasions. The atmosphere is unique; it's not your typical fancy steak house."}
{"text":"I'm still in absolute AWE over the size of the flippin' lobster tail I ate at this place. OH-MY-GOD where did it come from?  La Castile is insanely impressive to look at. From the outside, it looks like an old church (towers, stained glass windows, gothic feel). Once you're inside, it's sort of like being in a castle. I bet this place could have a kick ass Halloween party.  There is a large dining room, but also an area with tons of nooks and crannies with private seating areas.  Chandeliers, wooden beams, old school art work and wallpaper all add to the castle-like atmosphere.  Back to the food, every type of steak and seafood you could possibly imagine is on the menu. The lobster tail was ridiculous.   The food is served rather traditionally/plainly. It's definitely the type of place older people would like to eat. If you're looking for something young and hip, this is definitely not the place! If you're looking for a place to treat your parents, La Castile is likely a perfect choice.  The owner and most of the staff here are Greek. Very lovely people and quite friendly, but my friend was a regular and knew the owner, so perhaps we were given special treatment.  Very unique place!"}
{"text":"Old school steakhouse with tons of charm to spare.   Great prices for the quality you get. I've been there three times and tried their steaks, all were excellent especially the ribeye.   But you really have to try their Prime Rib. Best in the city.   I awarded 4 stars because the desserts are awful and not made in house. Tastes like they came straight out of a box."}
{"text":"This is what a steak house should be. I have travelled extensively though out North America and eaten in all of the high end steak joints the USA has to offer and this place ranks right up there with all of them. for me this is the Mississauga equivalent of Harbour 60 without the attitude   Whenever I have a client I want to impress this is my go to joint as it is close to the airport and I have never had a bad meal in this place EVER. Many of my clients comment about the night out and the old school décor.  I have had all of the steaks here, the filets, Neptune, Peppercorn, NY and the prime rib. all are generous portions and served the way a steak should be. the sides they way they should be and the salads with the blue cheese dressing that has more blue cheese than you can shake a stick at. Classic desserts and wine list that everyone can appreciate from mild to wild.   I have read the comments about the service and I am quite surprised that there has been negative reviews. My experience is just the opposite as the fact that the waiting staff here is exclusively older men who view their vocation as true professionals. Something so lacking in many of the twentysomthing;s that normally take the waiter jobs. Asking me how everything is 5 times during a meal IS NOT SERVICE fortunately this does not happen here. The wait staff serves the food makes sure you are taken care of and let you enjoy the meal. Something many restaurants could learn from.   So food is great and service is outstanding why only 4 and not five stars. (I wish I could give it 4 3/4 stars but this is not allowed) For me this is a bit of a dilemma as I have been coming to the restaurant for 20 years and the one of the reasons I come here is that I know what I am going to get. However the menu is also twenty years old and the occasional special or different dessert or maybe a game offering like Venison would put it over the top for me."}
{"text":"Up until recently, La Castile has always been my go-to steak resto in the west end. The food is very good, although the service can be hit or miss. My one pet peeve is they don't serve mashed potatoes as a side; I've only been able to get it once because it was a \"special of the day\".   I've been coming here for years but what really did me in the last time was the drastic price increase on drinks (vodka/sodas). When the bill came I couldn't believe the price - for a simple vodka soda we were charged $13 each! ..now I don't mind paying this for a specialty drink or a martini, but for an ounce of vodka it was absurd. The waitress explained it was about 9-10$ before & they decided to increase their price drastically.  Any other high end steak restaurant I've gone to I've paid $9-10 for a vodka, so where does La Castile get off with their pricing?! I was very disappointed, & don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other comments here - the food is a lot better then the service. But I'd rather that then the other way around!  One other negative was that I got a glass of one of the house wines - a Holick Red Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon 2006 Coonawaara. Their pricing for it was reasonable ($38 for a bottle, compared to $55 at '1800 degrees') but it was really grapey and I don't think it would go welll with any steak. I would expect that the house Cab would be a better steak wine."}
{"text":"Beautiful old castle and the food's great too.  Steaks and prime rib are always good.  Their lamb chops are fantastic.  I love the make it at your table Caesar salad!    Waiters are always helpful and I love the garlic bread,  so very garlicky!   Actual pieces if garlic clove all over the bread... Yum yum!"}
{"text":"YASSSS!!!!!  The atmosphere and decor alone is worth to visit this place, never mind the food.  Everything is beyond tasty, Rockafella Oysters are to die for, steak is incredible, seafood is fresh and delish.  Great place, visit, nothing else to add!"}
{"text":"The inside is old-fashioned and very nice. The clientele seem to be mostly older, rich folks. The waiters were all suited up like french waiters. Quite the atmosphere. I got the steak and scallops. Both were cooked perfectly although I'd say the steak was a bit drier than I would've liked. It was still delicious though. I did add salt to the scallops but maybe that's just me. I also really liked the garlic bread. It reminds me of Red Lobster's complimentary biscuits in that I can eat 5 of them before the meal without hesitation. Overall, it's a great, unique place for a date."}
{"text":"Went there for date night and service was great. The garlic bread was delicious. Huge portions. Typical steakhouse. The place and decor itself is what makes it! Definitely a recommendation."}
{"text":"At the sight of this wonderful restaurant, we were really impressed with the exterior of raging fires and the interior that brought a sense of a Victorian style. However, after talking to the hostess into the establishment, everything changed like a 180.   First, we had requested to be put in the Isabella room for its quiet and cozy appeal. In fact, in their reservations, it was noted that we requested this room. We arrived 15 minutes earlier as well. However, they placed us in another room noting that the Isabella room was unavailable, the grand ball room (maybe? could be incorrect) and it was heavily packed with an event going on at the same time. It was an awful seat with no ventilation, and there was a family of 4 right beside us. The mom was using the menu as a fan was what really let us know how they treated their customers and it was not like we didn't have a reservation.  We even noted to the server that we requested a more quiet seat and if we could switch to that seat, he didn't even try to contact the manager and just told us it was heavily booked, so there would be no chance we would get another seat.   My spouse was really mad at this point and decided to go back and talk to the hostess. The hostess was friendlier and offered us a seat in the hallway of the bar which was a bit breezy but definitely a lot better. The food took 45 minutes to arrive and the waiter was great but took a while to serve us as he had a lot of tables to wait on. The atmosphere slowly got better, there was a small area to dance and live music being played from a piano.   The creme brulee cheesecake was amazing, a definite must try!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times prior to my yelp days and as always 5 stars. I will bring my staff here after one of our shows almost every year and things are always consistently amazing!!! I with my wife will order the seafood platter for 2. Soooooooo good."}
{"text":"We went to La Castile to celebrate our anniversary. Service was superb and the food was excellent. I had the Steak Neptune.   The atmosphere was engaging with its old world charm   Definitely would recommend for special occasions"}
