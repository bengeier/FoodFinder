{"text":"We decided to try this place and were never at the old blue.   It was great!  There were so many things we wanted to try and were happy to see a range of prices from low to mid high.   Our food was so fresh and delicious.  The apps and entrees were fantastic and full of flavor.  My steak was cooked perfectly and was juicy and tender.   Our server was very knowledgeable and super friendly.  They had a great wine selection and suggestions for pairing.   We highly recommend this place and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a terrific restaurant. Never expected to find such a gem in a strip mall. The owner, Grainne, greeted us and was a wonderful host, checking in on us throughout our meal to make sure everything was okay -- and it was!  Our party of 6 was seated promptly (we had a reservation). After enjoying cocktails and wine, we had a very tasty tomato bisque and salads. For the main course, I had a delicious pork chop. My wife loved her salmon entree. Others had the tuna and the fillet which they throughly enjoyed. The menu was huge and had something for everyone. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner! We are long time patrons of the owner's previous restaurant and were thrilled to dine in Blue North! The appetizers were amazing... Ahi tuna was cooked to perfection with yummy, fresh salsa. The lobster stuffed mushrooms were a delicious upgrade on an old favorite. Try the crispy 5 minute egg! The grilled salmon with roasted tomato risotto was cooked to order and was a wonderful combination of flavors. The scallops and pasta and two orders of the bacon wrapped venison meatloaf received rave reviews as well! Our waitress, Asia, was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. We will go back again! Well done and congratulations."}
{"text":"I love the restaurant. I love the bar service(even on the very busy nights). The staff is friendly, engaging, and knowledgeable. I love the lamb dish and the calamari. I could go on, but it is a great venue and if you get the chance to try it do so."}
{"text":"Shocked by the $17 tab for the Manhattan that I ordered at the bar. While it was an upscale bourbon,  Blanton's, ( a $50 bottle at the PA state store),  felt ripped off.  Most expensive Manhattan in Pittsburgh!  For a moment, thought I was in Manhattan not the North Hills.  Overpriced drinks, average food and service. Tremendous drink and food scene 10-15 minutes south on Mcknight Rd. in the city.  It's worth the drive and will not disappointed like Blue North!"}
{"text":"I held a surprise party for a friend with 12 people in attendance in the Blue North beautiful party room. The  Wait staff were extremely attentive and polite, the  food was hot and delicious.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the evening end with a reasonable  bill for such high-quality food  and impeccable service . Thank you Blue North for a wonderful evening !!"}
{"text":"I have been there twice since new ownership and the food is definitely not what it used to be, and most certainly not worth the price.   The new owner is lacking in customer service by far.  Both times I have been there I have witnessed her being rude with other customers.   She will not honor gift certificates purchased under the previous owner.  As a result,  I was told to contact the previous owner to see if he could rectify the problem.  I would recommend wild sage restaurant as an alternative in the area.  Great service, food, drinks, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Should be called \"boo,\" and not, \"blue.\"  Came here Friday night and there were about twenty open tables. Told there'd be a fifteen minute wait. We asked why and we're told that if we were ordering food we could have a table. We said we were going to have appetizers and drinks. The hostess then informed us that since we weren't ordering dinner we were not entitled to a table!!  What!?! Drinks and appetizers don't get you a table when there are twenty free and available!?!?  Why this place would turn away paying customers is beyond me. Never returning."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant!  Wonderful menu, meals are delicious.... Seasoned just right.  Staff is friendly, efficient"}
{"text":"Always a favorite of mine. The seasonal menus are amazing (the lobster grilled cheese and tomato bisque last night were DEVINE!) and the wine specials are always great. Friendly and attentive staff and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is Monday - Friday 5p - 7p.  $3 off martinis.  

So I walked in explained that I was meeting friends who would be doing Happy Hour & I would be having dinner.  I was directed to the high top tables.  And then I was ignored.

The bartender took my non-alcoholic drink order.  Brings my drink.  I had to ask twice for a food menu.

My party of drinkers arrived ... service was beyond slow. The restaurant side had 2 occupied tables.  The bar was full.  No one helped the solo bartender.

My friends thought the espresso martini was too strong but the fruity flavored martinis had high scores.

My parmasean crusted romaine Caesar salad was different.  The seafood Diablo had large chunks of shrimp and salmon.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal and would eat it again.

The slowness of the wait staff became a joke at the table.   Before I write off this restaurant, I will sit on the restaurant side to see if service is any better."}
{"text":"Eh- nothing special. Our food took forever to come out and it felt like the server just woke up and was totally clueless. I think they are quite overpriced for what it tastes like frozen bagged shrimp. Their servings are very small for what they charge and presentation is mediocre."}
{"text":"The food was overly salty, even the bread was salty!  It's the next day and I am still drinking water. We did the pre-fixe menu. The first course with the homemade ricotta and zucchini and eggplant was good.  The eggplant however was tough, but the ricotta was very good. The salad was drowned in dressing to the point I could not taste the arugula. The chicken saltimbocca had a side of spinach and a half piece of bacon on the plate the chicken breast was cooked separately. Service was very good, but the overly salty food will not bring us back."}
{"text":"Had eaten at the \"Old\" Blue many times over the past. Three of us ate at the \"New\" Blue last night, the first night of the \"Grand Reopening\" . The menu was so diverse we ended up ordering 2 appetizers and 5 Main Entrees that we would share family style. The food came out in a timely fashion. Towards the end of our meal my 2 other diners said that the Scallops didn't taste right. So I ate the last one and it had a very, very strong ammonia taste. The sign of \"bad\" scallops. 
The older woman, maybe owner, came to our table half heartedly inquiring about our dining experience. I told her that we were served bad scallops, at which point she became very argumentative, and rude, stating that there was nothing wrong with the scallops. She should have taken them off of our bill which she didn't. She didn't apologize, or make any attempt at satisfying us, the customer. As far as she was concerned we were all lying about the rotten scallops.
Our overall dining experience was good, but for this restaurant to succeed this old woman needs to get serious customer service training or retire from the food service industry. She will keep me from going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We were a little unsure due to the mixed reviews but had a great dinner. This is a nice neighborhood bar/restaurant.

Drinks - regular martini $10 and the small batch bourbon manhattan $15 (not as bad as the quoted $17 one - this was Booker's bourbon). It was strong and tasted good. As for the price, it would have been nice if the prices were on the menu as this is clearly a cause of surprise.

The fava bean hummus was really good. The olives were marinated and varying in type and size -- I'd definitely get it again.

We had the house salad - it was fine. The bread came with orange butter - it was good.

For entrees - one had the Cornish game hen. It was perfect - crispy skin, juicy meat, and crispy al dente vegetables. It really couldn't have been made better. The other was the ricotta gnudi -- sort of cheese puffs. They were a little strong in garlic (no vampires seen anywhere near our table).

We had the chocolate panna cotta dessert. It tasted great though wasn't really set. 

Other reviews complained about the service. Ours was great. The server even chased us out to return a credit card.

Noise level was moderate - I suspect this depends on bar activity as there isn't much separation.There are some patio seats. It was about 1/2 full at 8 on a Friday.

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We went to dinner here last night and really enjoyed our meal! The bread was served with peach butter and both were very tasty. I ordered the House Made Potato Gnocchi and my husband ordered the Coffee Crusted Filet Mignon. The gnocchi and vegetables it came with were very good and his steak was very tender (ordered medium). The waitress was very friendly and the food came out very quickly. It was overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant! Great food and large portions with excellent prices. Our server (Jess) was attentive and gave us outstanding service. Don't be turned off by the strip mall location. This is one not to be missed."}
{"text":"I had not visited since the ownership change from Blue to Blue North and I am sorry I did. There was no comparison. The menu is limited. All my husband wanted was a plain seasoned steak or a filet he could not get one.  We ordered a bottle of red wine $42.  A twist off.!  On a positive note our waitress was great. She was attentive. I should have know better when we walked in at 7pm on a Friday night and the place was empty. We will not be headed back any time soon."}
{"text":"Yes, it's in a strip mall, and an old worn one at that. But don't be fooled by appearance. Blue is a true local gem. The menu is limited but diverse and creative, service professional and friendly, and the wine list thoughtful and reasonably priced. The owner is there every night which is the secret of success. We are regulars and therefore probably biased, but dining here is always a good experience - that's why we keep coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried Blue North out for the first time last night. We started with the butternut squash hummus. It was very well executed and tasted better than some of the hummus we have had at middle eastern restaurants in Pittsburgh. For the main course he had the filet mignon and I had the seared tuna. Both were delicious, cooked and seasoned correctly, and were beautifully plated. We will be back for another date night."}
{"text":"First, I would like to say I want all businesses to succeed. But, this place won't last if the service is always like what we received last night.
 We were a party of six and all local to Blue North. So it's a very convenient restaurant to go to when we want to have a nice dinner and drinks with friends.
 The food was very good and the prices were about right to a little high. Nothing too bad though.
 The service was terrible. Here's some examples of what was NOT done that any decent restaurant SHOULD do.
1. After food is served the waitress should come around to see how everything is and if we need anything.
2. Refill water glasses.
3. Clear dirty plates.
4. Ask if anyone would like dessert or coffee at the end of the meal.
Also, the drinks and checks took way too long to get. For a Saturday night the restaurant was not very busy either. Maybe the above is why.
 We won't go back. Sorry BN."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and being a recent transplant from NY I was skeptical about coming here but it's close to my house. Pleasantly surprised. Wonderful Caesar salad, great martinis and Arnold palmer . Tuna was done nice and rare and tasty.. cooked to order.. delicious chocolate cheesecake dessert. Great service from Shannon."}
{"text":"This weekend was my first time at this establishment and had a great experience. Our food was delicious and our server Jess was awesome and personable , very knowledgeable and offered good suggestions. Would definitely recommend to our friends and plan to come back soon."}
{"text":"The bar still has a great happy hour but they have added some great wines and the new chef is doing incredible things
 Their take on a grilled cheese and tomato soup is nothing short of amazing. Crispy without being greasy with some of the freshest and tastiest tomato soup I have had
 If you don't want to commit to a whole dish try their wine pairings on the third Tuesday of the month
 The.pork belly taco with almost a chocolate tasting Mellott reduction was one of delicious things I have eaten."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Really... I smiled my whole meal!  Even the drinks were incredible!  The owner came to the table to ask about our Meal.  She also spoke with us about their wine pairing nights."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with the food, service, or atmosphere. Chef likes to change up the butter flavor for the (AMAZING) homemade focaccia bread."}
{"text":"Says they open at 4, people
Inside.  They see us standing outside at 4:15 but decide to ignore us.  Guess they don't need any new business."}
{"text":"Came here for a food and beer pairing event and the portions were ridiculously small for the high price that you pay. Including the 2 cocktails we ordered, our bill came to $100. Afterwards the server came around and asked if we would like to order anything off the dinner menu! My husband and i looked at each other and at the same time and we said \"let's go to Wendy's\"..

On the other hand, we ate dinner here a handful of times and I must say that the dinner is worth the high price! Everything on the menu, from the drinks down to the bread and butter, is so unique! The chef is a culinary GENIUS. The really cool thing about this place is the fact that they change their menu seasonally, they're constantly coming up with amazing options! 

All in all, I would say to skip any type of food and beer and / or wine tasting event and just get a table or booth and enjoy it that way!"}
