{"text":"2 couples we went. The place was very busy. 
Service was very friendly and food delicious. 
We had a bunch of drinks. 
End result $200 a couple. 
I would go back there again!!!"}
{"text":"This is our second time at Barnesteiner's. We came months ago when it first opened. We sat by the bar and enjoyed the vibe and the wonderful food, although I saw the big-haired host lady scoop ice from the bar with her bare hand. I pretended I didn't see it. We are here again tonight for the good food but I'm so annoyed by the service. We didn't make a reservation but we were quickly seated to a table. We are sitting here for for a while and no one approached us with a menu so I asked someone for it. More minutes go by and no water, no server introducing himself to take our drink order at least. Someone finally approaches us and she asks if we made reservation (?), I don't know why because we are already sitting down. A server approaches us but he's not very friendly. I've never had such bad service at a restaurant before, it leaves a really bad taste. I was hoping this place would become our new favourite neighbourhood restaurant, but I'll never come back again."}
{"text":"good food but awful noise.  Anyone over 35 will hate eating there at night.  It hurts too much.  They should use the old trick of stapling empty egg crates under chairs and tables to take out the shrillest of the noise decibels.    Other restaurants who have done this still have a buzz, but not the shrill noise levels."}
{"text":"Love the food, just wish they could do something about the open kitchen and the too-small exhaust fan. The place heats up a ton in the summer. They do have a patio with limited seating."}
{"text":"The ambience and service were good. The food was okay, but not exceptional or memorable. The menu was limited with only a handful of options. The value was poor with small portions and no included refills of soda or iced tea. Overall, there are much better options as close as across the street..."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is delicious, the staff is professional, and the owner (Michelle) always makes a point to chat with each of the patrons and ensure they have a great experience. Would go there every day if I could."}
{"text":"Rude service. A lady (owner maybe?) asked us and another table when we were planning to leave- it was only 5:30 pm and both our parties had reservations. We were made aware that they were expecting 120 people over the course of that night. 

I felt unwanted before I even sat down at my table because I had brought my kid with me (other parties also were with children under two). They made a big point to let me know that this was their last high chair they were giving to us (oh thank you, kind, generous provider of scarce high chairs!!!)

Prices do not line up with quality/quantity of food (tuna tartare and duck breast were good (small portion, but forgivable because it was delicious if not a bit too salty)) but grilled calamari, spaetzle and osso bucco were a joke- calamari was soooo small, only one small calamari and drenched in 1/4 inch of oil that sat at the bottom of the bowl...and no salad to be had just one olive and some capers, no char flavour. Portion sizes of the mains were borderline unacceptable. Osso bucco tagliatelle was supposed to be \"pulled\" meat but only contained 3 small cubes of meat, no bone or marrow in sight? Spaetzle was mushy and greasy .

***Added after looking at some photos from other reviewers: it appears that the bread basket brought to some Winterlicious diners had 5x as much bread in it as what was brought to us, ordering off the regular menu outside of Winterlicious time frames. Unacceptaple. The bread in our basket was sliced so thinly you could see through it, and only 5 slices*** 

They read specials to another table but not to us. Took away wine glasses but didn't ask if we wanted more. Server was pretty short with us, acting exasperated at our questions and legit walked away from us while we were deciding what to order- it was rude. We left before dessert, which we never do. 

Kept getting the feeling that the wait staff were talking about us... 

On the way out, the same owner lady said \"thank you?\" Like it was a question or like maybe we should have said thank you to her on our way out... Not sure, think she was surprised at how quickly we left.

I have never been so tempted to leave zero tip, but left 15% out of a sense of duty to do so. Left hungry, annoyed, and feeling like I needed to go sit down at another restaurant to get the great experience we had been expecting and looking forward to.

Ive never been so compelled to write a negative review. I also posted to my 1000+ Facebook followers who trust my judgement on food if nothing else."}
{"text":"Recently tried Barnsteiners which opened a few weeks ago in our neighbourhood.  We went during Winterlicious which is sometimes not the best time to sample a restaurant but in this case it worked out very well.  It's a comfortable, bustling bistro. But it's not overly loud.  We sampled several appetizers including the Smoked Chicken Salad, the Marinated Beets  and the Garlic and Chili Shrimp.  The shrimp and the beets were hits.  Flavourful.  The shrimpy were perfectly cooked.  The smoked chicken was okay but paled by comparison.  For mains we had the Roasted Black Angus striploin, the grilled Atlantic salmon and the Venison stew.  They were all very good.  The salmon was requested rare and came just as ordered.  The striploin was tender and flavourful.  The venison stew was excellent.  For dessert we sampled the apple crumble, the orange spiced chocolate cake and the lemon panacotta.  They were all very good.  Winterlicious pricing was $35 for the 3 course meal.  Excellent value.  Regular prices are a little higher but reasonable if the quality stays on a par with our Winterlicious dinner.  Service was professional - attentive but unobtrusive.  Wine prices seem to average a 300% mark-up compared to LCBO prices."}
{"text":"Oh how I miss John & Sons :( Now that Easy Catch has bit the dust, there are no fish and chip restos in my hood. Service here is still most excellent but am just not crazy about yet another Italian/Euro place around here -- there's almost nothing else sadly. The sushi place has great food but no booze so not a good place for dinner. Ok, so Barnsteiner's offers just about the same fare as anyone else in the area. We could really use a French Bistro (yes, there's Browne's but it's too old-fashioned)."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Ordered off the regular menu not summerlicious.
We ordered the Black Bean Soup,the Musvovy Duck Breast and the veal wienerschnitzel. 
Both of us thoroughly enjoyed the flavorful smoky soup with a rich texture and just a job right of sour cream on top.
The duck breast was perfectly cooked to medium as we requested (on the 2nd try ) and was delicious.  The wienerschnitzel was cooked just right leaving the veal tender and juicy unlike many restaurants who don't know how to cook it and present you with essentially breaded leather.

For dessert:  We had a flaky and authentic apple strudel with vanilla sauce and flavourful vanilla ice which is a big compliment from me as I don't usually like vanilla. 
Our waiter was very friendly and attentive and was especially effective in dealing with some missteps from the kitchen which were corrected cheerfully.  We were comped the dessert coffee and soup as a result of these blips which shows a high level of customer care in my books.
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's finally open!  The former owners of The Corner House have a new home.  Defined as \"contemporary European\", I would just call it \"delicious food\".

We took a chance and walked in with no reservations, and lucked out.  The place was packed, but Michelle found room for us.

We didn't have a huge appetite so we only tried a couple of dishes: venison stew, knodles (bread dumplings) and a side of brussel sprouts.  The venison stew was the winner of these three - soft, melt-in-your-mouth meat full of flavour.  One of those meals you'll remember (and crave) for a long time.  The bread dumplings were interesting, as I've never had anything like it before.  I chose them because they were in a special section of the menu called \"Chef's Homeland\".  Three different types/flavours: beets, spinach and bacon.  Like a soft meatball, but more interesting.  I was worried they would be too doughy, but not the case at all.  Loved the beet and spinach dumplings, the bacon one was just okay.  Brussel sprouts were good, but the portion was kinda small and (never thought I would say this, but...) a little too much bacon compared to the sprouts.

We couldn't pass on dessert.  I was impressed to see a fairly long list of offerings, plus the back of the menu had several cheeses.  We decided to split the mango passionfruit pannacotta, topped with granola.  It was light and refreshing, not too sweet.  Granola was crispy.  A great way to end our meal.

Things I can't wait to try:
- the wine (extensive list, every table was sharing a bottle)
- the lobster bisque
- Bavarian mac 'n cheese
- schnitzel
- oysters
- fish & chips
- lemon tart
- apple strudel
(that's all I can remember right now)

The waiter explained that they were testing out their new menu and will eventually add some specials or tweak the menu.  Can't wait to see what they offer next!

Service was good.  Quite noisy - could be because it's the holiday season, or just that it was a busy Friday night.

We'll be back to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --

My bestie and I were here for Summerlicious dinner. Barnsteiner's was around 3 minutes walk from St. Clair Station. We made a reservation for window seats for a party of 2. I didn't understand why the hostess put us in a table for 6 which wasn't a window seat (and later she assigned two other customers to our table). We didn't enjoy sharing a table and found it awkward that a Modern European Restaurant had this type of arrangement. There were service discrepancies between Summerlicious and regular menu customers. I was looking over at the customers next to us who ordered from the regular menu and noticed the server showed more attention to them and constantly refill their water, whereas ours had been empty for a while and the server just simply ignored us. 

When we were working on our entree, the restaurant suddenly turned off all the lights. We ended up eating in the dark and they didn't put a candle on our table (They put candles on other tables). If I didn't bring my DSLR, I don't think I could have take any proper food pictures given there was no light in the restaurant. 

-- Food and Drink -- 
(I didn't try my friend's dishes, everything was based on her comments)

We ordered the following items:

1. Tuna Tartare (ginger, jalapeno, white soy, sourdough crisps)
- This appetizer was very fresh and flavorful! The tuna tartare had a strong miso taste (I guess because of the white soy and ginger marinate). Tuna was fresh! I loved how they added their house-made sourdough crisps in it which added extra texture to this lovely appetizer!  The jalapeño in the tartare successfully removed the fishy taste in it! I would definitely reorder this dish if I revisited Barnsteiner's in the future! 

2. Whole Roasted Striploin (smashed new potatoes, beans, mushrooms, veal jus)
- I love their cut a lot! I usually have bad luck with striploin where they always overcook my steak. I was so happy to see the medium rare pink! The Striploin was so tender! I am not a bean person but it was seasoned perfectly! The only thing to complain about was that the potato was kinda bland.

3. Brick Roasted Boneless Chicken (white bean, asparagus, chorizo, watercress (local))
- My friend loved this chicken! It was seared perfectly and they used fresh corn for the dish!

4. Local Marinated Strawberries (vanilla bean ice cream)
- My friend liked the dessert, but she wasn't a fan of the little cookie. 

5. Lemon Semifreddo (coconut, sunflower seed, oat crunch, blueberries)
- This semi-frozen lemon dessert tasted like ice-cream! The lemon taste was so strong and the tangy taste was lingering in my mouth! Perfect way to end your meal! :) 

6. Michelle's Fav Cocktail
- I loved this Cocktail A LOT! The grapefruit juice base was perfect for summer! 

7. Good Friend Cocktail 
- She loved her drink as well! :)

-- Overall --

Their food was great! I love their cocktail a lot! I wasn't impressed with their service (below par). I hope the owner will spend some time reading all the negative comments on their service and work on it. If not, even if you serve good food, customers won't go back if they don't receive good service."}
{"text":"Went during Winterlicious for a Tuesday dinner.
For $35, I had the carrot soup, venison stew, and apple+cranberry crumble.

--PROS--
The soup was excellent. It was creamy and at the same time still had enough of the carrot's texture leftover. Wish they gave more though.
The stew was good. Not as good as the soup, but decent.

The service is as expected for an establishment under the 'licious banner (except for the hostess).

The atmosphere, decor, ambiance was good, although it has a few issues that could be fixed if they wanted to.

My mom and dad had the cappuccino. She claims it was the second best cappuccino she's ever had. Dont know how significant that is cause she doesnt usually drink coffee anyways, but she likes so posting it here.

--MEH--
The desserts are a bit small for my liking. But it is dessert. Owell.

The place could be a tad brighter, but that's probably just personal preference.

And as a few yelpers have mentioned, the noise level is a bit too high. Probably something to do with the sound absorption materials of the ceiling, walls, and kitchen (dinning hall and kitchen are pretty much one room). Or the fact they tried packing in too many tables.

--CONS--
The tables were too crowded. I'm pretty sure if there's a fire in the kitchen (beside our table), breaking the windows would be faster than heading for the doors. There's a few spots where the waiters themselves needs to walk sideways to get through.

Portions for the entree was too small. My brother asked for McD even before the bill has arrived, and he eats less than me. I dont feel the price justified the small portions. I didnt expect it to be full, but certainly not a feeling of hunger still. Had to go get BK nuggets after ($2 for 10).

But my biggest concern was the hostess. I'm assuming it was one of the owners as she didnt serve any of the tables and mainly stood at the station beside the entrance. 
She saw us when we walked in, but no smile or eye contact and proceeded to explain the menu to another customer. Ok, fine, she's busy, whatever. After she finished, she walks to the kitchen to do something for a bit, comes back and avoids eye contact with me and starts pressing the reservation screen. Glances at me and asks me the cordial \"How are you?\". I respond and asks the same, silence. Ok, fine, straight to the point then. I told her our reservations, she finds it, grabs some menus, turns around, and mumbles \"This way\" (which I can barely hear). Walks to a spot two tables away to the our tables and then just looks a me. Pauses for a bit, and then squeezes between the chairs of other customers to get to our table, places our menu on the table and walks off. We still havent received a smile or a feeling of a warm welcome. Ok, fine, she was busy and tired so had to half ass that, ok.
Our entree came and we're enjoying it. She comes over and does the courteous \"How's everything so far?\" No eye contact at all when asking that. None! Then walks off even before waiting for our response. What the heck!

==OVERALL==
Based on overall experience, I would avoid because of the service of one person.
The place itself isnt too bad and the food is actually quite good. Although the portions themselves could be bigger given the price.

For $35 Winterlicious dinner, I'd suggest another restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The place was busy but not too noisy. We had the burger, steak frites and schnitzel. Everyone left full and happy. Would go again"}
{"text":"I was really impressed - it was a busy Friday night, but the service was excellent. The rosemary parmesan flatbread was amazing. Probably the best gnocchi I've ever had. All three of our meals were excellent."}
{"text":"Unlike two of the awful reviews below - note they've written one review each in history - our experience was excellent.

Seated promptly, quick & attentive service.

Excellent Old Fashions from the bar, fresh and tasteful salads, followed up with excellent entrees.

As we leave, the place is packed. There's a reason."}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious, the dish we wanted to try - which was the reason we chose the restaurant - was \"not on the menu\". The server, Alex, offered us bread while we were waiting for our appetizers. The food was decent, nothing that would make me want to come back. Paid the bill, gave 24.5% tip, as the service had been great that night (even though when the bill came he had charged us for the bread to \"offset the recent wage increase \"). That's when the temper tantrum began.   Our unfinished drinks were snatched off the table without even asking if we were done. Then when we were walking out, my friend was walking behind me and the server was walking so close to her he ended up licking her not once, but twice, but three times. After the third, she turned assertions and genuinely asked \"am I not walking fast enough?\" His response? \"Actually no, you're not..\"  
Won't be going back. Wish I read these reviews and Google reviews before we chose to try this place."}
{"text":"My first time here, the place looks impressive. I ordered duck and I liked it, but the side that came wasn't tasty. I wasn't impressed with service at all. And the prices are pretty high. 
I might go back once, but not soon...."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and inviting ambiance. We came in for Summerlicious...unfortunately I did not have time to make this review sooner as I would've been able to name the dishes for each course. Despite previous reviews, I found the service to be satisfactory overall. Service started off a bit...dismissive at first - we booked reservations in advance. There were a lot of empty seats when we arrived and the hostess decided to place us at the very back near the bathrooms...thankfully she obliged when we asked her to seat us in the private room where there were plenty of empty seats. Service picked up from that point - our server was fantastic and made sure that we had a great lunch experience. Food overall was great - I especially enjoyed the main course (grilled cod?) Overall, good service, great food, great ambiance."}
{"text":"Sorry we wanted to love you but we got great disappointing we feel like its bad parody on neighborhood reastaraunts  food was below overage veal schnitzel was like old greasy shoo shpazly  was soft taste leas and not fresh .salads was so small and beats wasn't fresh , servers let you feel like they make you favor to serve you. Menu look like they copy one item from every resto in the area but looks they ivan bad in making  copy's lol .Its much better option for me to spend my hard working money in joints who  don't cares for patrons or at least serve distant meal.So good bye never again."}
{"text":"Food (3.5/5)
For starters I had the curried crab cakes which were amazing! It was made out of real crab meat and the curry flavor wasn't too heavy. However, there were a couple of shell pieces which was annoying. My boyfriend had the dairy free mushroom soup which was good too but not amazing. He also got a beer which came out warm so he wasn't too impressed. 
For the mains I had the grilled Atlantic salmon which was perfectly cooked and fatty. My boyfriend got the charred tilapia which was a bit too dry and overly salty. However we loved the greens it came with. He normally doesn't like arugula but the way they cooked it turned out delicious. 
They were out of panna cotta which was really disappointing because it was one of the main reasons we'd picked Barnsteiner's but they had a lemon pudding to substitue and that was good. It was tangy and sweet. My boyfriend got the chocolate bread pudding which was mediocre. I found that it was dry and didn't really taste like anything. Also, the portions were pretty small and we both left hungry.       

Atmosphere and service (3/5):
Went on Saturday with a group of 9 to try their winterlicous menu. They gave us a great table and the decor is beautiful and unique. Our waiter got all the orders right but wasn't as attentive as expected. Our water glasses weren't filled often enough and we felt a bit dropped, like we weren't as important as some of the other groups. However, the manager was really nice and came by to chat with us and make sure we were doing okay."}
{"text":"This is a review for the restaurant Summerlicious 2017 dinner. After 3 for 3 successful Summerlicious 2017 outings, my 4th one was a total fail at Barnsteiner's. I guess my luck ran out.

I heard a lot of wonderful things about this restaurant. The Chef and owner has worked for Jump and these are the same owners that were behind Corner House.

 I tried to organise a meetup event for a meetup group I run but there was no interest. Maybe I should have taken that as a sign. Since I still wanted to give a try, I organised a small dinner with my girlfriends for four.

My friend was the first to arrive before me. The restaurant had led her to sit inside a hot stocky sunroom? with no AC and just a fan running to keep the air flowing. (It was hot that day). Had I been there first, I would not have accepted that table nor room. It was totally unbearable. thank goodness I could take some of my clothes to feel better and try to substain from the heat. There were still seats still available outside the patio and inside the air conditioned room. I don't quite understand why we were put in that room. Is it because I made a reservation on open table? 

Funny thing that there was a table for two, which they set next to our table and was put against a wall, resulting in a very uncomfortable position. Three times they try to sit people there and each time, the patrons asked to sit elsewhere as it was so stuffy.

Then there is the food. Every dish I had that evening fell short and were inconsistent. Each plate of food came out looking very different even though some of us had ordered the same items. My main beef entree was just plain and it was missing a key veggie. My appetizer came out falling apart already before it was set on the table.  My dessert had no sauce. When I inquired how come my dessert looked so completely different from my friend's, our waiter's explanation was because my friend's dessert had too much sauce?!? You would think the waiter would have noticed the inconsistency when bringing out all the dishes at once to our table but the waiter was pretty much rushing (even though the resto was not that busy). I felt the kitchen was just churning out dishes at a factory speed without giving a thought on taste and quality.

Our waiter might have been consistent in taking orders and bringing out the dishes (maybe too fast which lead to my appetizer falling apart) but other than that.. that was it. He lacked charism and personality.  

I felt so bad for my girlfriends and I kept apologizing for such a disappointing dinner since I was the one who suggested this restaurant.  They knew it wasn't my fault. 

I avoided another restaurant for years after a failed licious dinner and Barnsteiner's is no exception. This will be on my list to avoid for years to come."}
{"text":"Barnsteiner's is a frequent participant in Toronto's Winterlicious and Summerlicious events. I'm guessing this is one of the reasons why their ratings are so much lower than they deserve to be. My experience, entirely outside of these two events, couldn't be more different.

I've been to Barnsteiner's several times due to its proximity from my place of work, and I've received nothing but excellent food and spectacular service. The interior is tastefully decorated and very much in line with the upper-class, Yonge/St. Clair neighbourhood. The wait staff is attentive and very friendly, which is a great change of pace from their counterparts from similar, upscale restaurants in the area.

I've tried the Bavarian Mac-and-Cheese as well as the Potato Gnocchi and both are phenomenal. I've heard great things about the Mushroom Risotto, and that's probably what I'll be trying the next time I'm around.

Don't let the Winterlicious crowd skew your expectations. Barnsteiner's is a gem."}
{"text":"Honestly, I expected more after reading the reviews. The food was a-okay, a little bit flavourless though. The service was slow, and I saw servers just walking around doing nothing and just chatting between each other. The place is a bit loud and messy, And it seemed like they were trying to put as many tables as possible, so there's very little room between tables.
For this price you can get much better food and service. 
Drinks were ok.
Food:2 star
Service:3 star
Atmosphere:1 star
Will never go there again."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. I decided to try it for lunch with a friend after a long walk and it definitely hit the spot. We ordered the lemon sole, a daily special, and the gnocchi. The fish was crisp and extremely fresh over perfectly cooked fingerling potatoes and caramelized vegetables. The gnocchi was tender with an extremely flavourful sauce. The only downside to the experience was having to ask for water after two different servers had both come by to say they would get us some. Overall, that did not dampen the mood as the servers were extremely friendly and the food was amazing. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here on Valentine's Day.  It was a $70 prix fixe.  My husband and I were quite dissatisfied: the food was terribly overvalued - I had a soup and a steak, and the steak was one of the cheapest, fattiest cuts possible, and my soup was literally a half cup of cream.  My husband's main, a veal tenderloin, was good - but his appetizer, oysters, was notably small and over priced.  The prix fixe came with a shared dessert.  It was honestly, maybe, the value of a $35 winterlicious prix fixe, but we paid over double for it.  The decor and layout are confusing and terrible: it is drafty, the servers ended up bumping into the tables all the time as the tables were set too close together, and it is honestly easy to get lost in this small oddly laid out place.  We felt rushed by the server, who would disappear for long periods of time, then reappear smelling of cigarette smoke.  We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner during winterlicious, did the Prix fixe menu. For app we had the flat bread with arugula salad and pear with I believe was goat cheese. The pear with goat cheese was really good the flat bread was okay. For the main we order the trout and venison, they were both amazing. For dessert we had the orange semifreddo and chocolate cake they were both good. As with most restaurant midtown on Yonge Street you have to find parking. The service was okay, We did make a reservation a week in advance, however they put us at the worst table possible right by the entrance and the restaurant was half full. Beside that everything is good."}
{"text":"Had my first visit to Barnsteiners last night to try their Winterlicious menu and loved it! Terrific location, it had a very warm, open, social atmosphere. The host and staff were very efficient and friendly, and all of my food was excellent. I had the Barn Caesar Salad (wonderful fresh lemon Caesar vinaigrette), the Cornish hen, and chocolate cake with a sweet orange glaze that worked perfectly together. Highly recommended, will be back again without a doubt."}
{"text":"Party of 3 for the winterlicious menu $38.I choose the wild mushroom soup as appetizer and the salmon as main. As for dessert I got the panna cotta.

The mushroom soup was very flavourful with bits of mushroom. However if it was a tad bit hotter it would be perfect. I love hot soup.

The salmon I requested medium done. It was cooked to my asking and the skin was very crispy. The sauce I wasn't too keen on as it tasted a bit sour to me.  My friend had the hen, I tried a bit and it was delicious. Would recommend the hen.

On to dessert. The panna cotta tasted amazing. The texture was very creamy and nice. It was bought out in a mason jar.

As for service I would give it a 5 stars. Our server made sure we had our hot water and was very attentive. The restaurant itself was nicely decorated but it was a bit dark. Would go back to eat lunch next time!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our 2017  Valentine's dinner here with a prix fixe menu; waiter's service was very warm and professional. The restaurant decor was welcoming and rustic. For wine, we had a Classico (Lovatti), very rich, smooth and hints of berries flavors. 

App:
1. Duck 3 ways - arugula salad with walnuts, squash and duck-3-ways was very seasoned, juicy and  fresh; the different duck textures were outstanding from each other
2. Tuna Tartar - fresh, refreshing and well-seasoned; a recommend 

Main:
1. Lamb Rack- 3-piece lamb rack cooked medium well; very tender and juicy but a little blander than preferred. Overall display was pleasing
2. Tenderloin with vegetables - medium-cooked tenderloin was cooked on-point; the mushrooms was very flavorful! Also a little blander than preferred

Dessert-for-two:
Chocolate mousse, chocolate strawberry and edible petal; the mousse we enjoyed very, very much! It was smooth, rich, chocolate-y but not that sweet - the perfect blend! Display was very aesthetically pleasing! 

Had a great night with the girlfriend"}
{"text":"I've passed by this place many many times but never really gave much thought to it. This time my husband surprised me with a lunch and we ended up here. First impression was good. Staff is friendly and greet you as soon as you walk through the door. They wanted to seat us at a high chair table but I asked for a lower table and that was not a problem. For starter we both ordered the wild mushroom soup, which was served on a hot plate. It had chunks of mushroom and was seasoned nicely. With this we got bread and paprika hummus on the house. The hummus was very delicious! For main we went for the blackened haddock and the roasted cornish hen. Both of these mains were amazing! So flavourful and perfectly cooked! I can't say enough to to describe how good this was and how well all the items on the plate worked together. The cornish hen had crispy skin and was soft and moist on the inside. The haddock was nicely charred and had a delicious flavour on its own. The side that was served with it complemented the flavour perfectly! For dessert we had apple cranberry crumble pie with vanilla ice cream and lemon mousse. The desserts were very tasty but the stars of the meal were definitely the two mains.
5 stars out of 5 possible, for obvious reasons!"}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience my first visit. Along the lines of unacceptable. 

The owner discussed the issue with me and I took from the conversation that really, bad stuff can happen to anyone. So i disregarded it. 

I went back only to have another bad experience. I'm definitely done with this place. Really sad, their previous restaurant was one of my favorites. 

The issue here is the service staff."}
{"text":"BarnSteiner is a comfortable busy spot just south of St. Clair on Yonge. The menu has many really good choices that should appeal to most. Nice wine list and a small but well chosen beer selection. I had a fresh tasty Caesars salad and the seafood stew. The stew was good but I had two issues. Only two clams. Since when did clams get so expensive? Also only two very small pieces of toasted bread in the dish. This is a nice dish but the skimping on clams and toast was off putting. Very good service. Nice choice for dinner but they guard the clams closely if that matters to you."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Barnsteiner's for Winterliciouis lunch. The minute we walked in we were greeted with the warm scent of cinnamon and apple, and friendly smiles from the staff. Their open kitchen concept is beautiful, and the rustic feel is nice and cozy. The owner Michelle sat us at a high table next to funky 'knobs' on the wall that could be used to hang our coats and bags - so cute! 

We were served crusty bread with hummus as a starter, which was a nice touch. We barely touched the hummus since our apps came soon after, but it tasted pretty good, but nothing too special. However, hummus with bread was a nice unique starter that definitely set it apart from most restaurants. 

My friend ordered the Garlic and Chili Grill Shrimps with crusty bread and salsa verde, and I had the Ginger Spice Carrot Soup with toasted almonds and whipped mascarpone. The shrimps were delicious and buttery. My soup had such great flavour. The ginger and carrot went very well together, it had a nice texture, and was a great dip for my crusty bread! 10/10 for the appetizers.

I had the Crackling Roasted Cornish Hen with candied apples, root vegetables, spinach and pan jus. I LOVED this dish! The meat was so tender and moist, and the candied apples and veggies soaked in the pan jus made this a great balance of flavours that never got boring; I was always looking forward to the next bite. The pan jus? Yum! 10/10!

Dessert was probably my favourite part... EXCEPT, they really looked like piles of crap on our plates. It looked so ugly that I didn't even want to take a picture of it! The only time I was not impressed. 

I had ordered the Orange Spiced Warm Chocolate Cake while my friend had the Spy Apple and Cranberry Crumble. WOW! Dessert was SO delicious. The chocolate cake went very very well with the orange spice and bits of candied ginger. The outside was nice and crispy, while the inside was moist, luscious and warm. As for the crumble, it had the perfect amount of sweetness. 

I suggest to maybe have the crumble served in a ramekin with mint to garnish? Or a mason jar? Everyone loves mason jars. And perhaps have the cake served in a fancier dish or something of that sort.. Nevertheless, I recommend a visit to Barnsteiner's. The food is too delicious to pass up!"}
{"text":"I went to Barnsteiner's, the new contemporary/eclectic restaurant that opened where John & Sons used to be.  First of all they have done a great job renovating and the new interior is much warmer and more refined.  It was a Wednesday night and it was VERY busy so come early or make a reservation.  Like John & Sons they serve oysters.  We ordered a dozen large from the East Coast and they were excellent.  It took a while I guess because they were very busy.  We also had the rosemary flatbread and the tuna tartar main both of which were also very good.  They have a reasonable selection of beers on tap as well.  I have to say the service was a bit slow probably because it is still very new and they were very busy."}
{"text":"My first visit here was for a winterlicious dinner a few weeks back with some friends.

The exterior was inviting and inside was dimly lit, and the warm and cozy atmosphere was the perfect place to spend a cold January night. 

We are a very easy-going, good mannered, and friendly group. However, our server wanted nothing to do with that and although not rude, was cold and unfriendly and was straight down to business. Without cracking a smile he efficiently took our order and was gone immediately after. We shrugged it off and continued on with our night.

The food came without much of a wait which was nice. The majority of us ordered a Brussels sprout Caesar salad for the appetizer. It was delicious! Who would have thought to add grilled brussels sprouts to a Caesar but it complimented the dish perfectly and added some bulk and texture. The salad was lightly dressed but had great taste. Only con was the proportion of sprouts per salad. While some of us had 8/9 sprouts, my two friends only got 2 in their dish - something the kitchen needs to work on, and in retrospect, something we should have brought up to our server, but seeing his previous attitude wasn't something we wanted to get into. 

The majority of the table had the steak for their mains and all said it was really good. The plating was a disaster though and looked like leftovers, with the heaps of meat sloshing around the plate of jus, some with many veggies, and again, some with barely any. 

I had the mushroom ravioli which was really good and plated nicely. Portion was pretty small, and they could have afforded another 2/3 raviolis but aside from that I would order again. 

Dessert was forgettable - I had some sort of berry cobble which was eaten but nothing special and could have done without.

The end to our night was as cold as the beginning when server came with one bill for the table before we asked for it. We nicely asked if he could actually split for us (some of us had a drinks) and he loudly sighed and snarkily and angrily replied that maybe in the future we could ask him beforehand since it is really hard for him to do after the fact and now how can he remember what each of us ordered... and went off in a huff. 

He was clearly rather fussed about this and I feel that 1) you should never speak to a customer like that, even if you are having a bad night - customer service is what sets you apart from your competitors! 2) if it is so hard to split bills why didn't he ask the table our preference before he brought it out? he brought the bill before requested and before we even had a chance to ask for separate bills 3) this rarely seems to be an issue at other restaurants. If Barnsteiners has outdated technology, that is not the fault of the customer. It is 2017. People frequently split bills.

Anyhow, left a sour taste in my mouth and although the food was good, the attitude wasn't and doesn't leave me any reason to return."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with moderately low expectations but was pleasantly surprised and found the food to be very good. They have hands down the best grilled calamari I've ever tried, and I had a flat bread, which was also amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great meal. Really great. I would say one of the best bistro meals I've had in the city in ages. The only thing that held it from 5 stars was the price. I felt it was a bit overpriced for what we ended up with. I know Toronto is expensive but $50 a head with no booze and only two starters and two desserts was a bit much. Great place for date night but I but pricey for family night out."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good choice of wine and the food was good and cooked to order (my husband takes his meat blue). Would definitely go again."}
