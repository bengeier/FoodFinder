{"text":"Pancakes and bacon - You have a choice of sausage, ham or bacon, but come on... the only real choice is bacon, ALWAYS. Why? Well, because 1) bacon is always the answer and 2) they give you eight fucking slices of it; That's FIVE, *****5***** more than most other places... oh yeah, this order also includes three incredibly fluffy pancakes.   The pancakes actually taste like cake; not overly sweet, great bouncy texture with a nice griddled crust. Three of these are way more than you can finish, unless you suffer from whatever that disease is called that makes you maple syrup deficient and need to put away these bad boy syrup sponges."}
{"text":"Great tasting breakfast (eggs, bacon, home fries...) Good portions. My boss paid, so I guess the price is right too!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back every now and then because its close to home, available and what you would expect. I think it deserves 3.5 stars. I will give it 4 cause I've never had any issues with the service, the expected quality of the food, nor the atmosphere. I like their burgers, I like that you can choose your toppings and there are so many cheese choices. I hate that they dont come with a side and you have to pay extra for fries or salad. Their breakfast is good, too. They have a bar and you can order caesars. Their daily special, though I have never ordered it, always seems to be the same- steak-frites. Service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot. You can get French toast made with challah bread. The waffles are excellent too. Friendly staff and great prices.  Plus you don't have many hipsters going in the resto like L'Avenue which I find is overpriced, slow and has bad tasting food."}
{"text":"One of the perks of going to a restaurant is that the food is prepared for you, but when my salad with avocado came, it was barely chopped at all-I had to cut everything up myself. Also they used lots of iceberg lettuce which is the least nutritious and least tasty of all the lettuce types. I make better salads at home.  On the plus side the coffee was good and the waiters and waitresses are nice."}
{"text":"Horrible personnel! Horrible food! Charged me 6$ for olives and hung up on me twice when i called to ask why! They should just close up shop!"}
{"text":"Oh dear !  Really cold outside, pretty ' cool ' inside too We live very close by, will never go again. Dinner ok....but  ho- hum,  could barely -be- bothered staff.... Polite is alright, but friendly is even better. they were not busy, just disinterested... we came and went....guess what...no one noticed. Am wondering how they stay open ? Grand / Somerled Honestly...more friendly at McDonald' s .....I' 'll go there for a hamburger"}
{"text":"Le service est brusque et vraiment peu souriant. Nous avons toujours l'impression d'être en train de déranger. La nourriture est très ordinaire et si vous commandez des calmars, ceux-ci sont en général pas assez cuits et servi avec une sauce qui n'a rien à voir avec la sauce cocktail habituelle. De plus, de recevoir cette sauce dans un petit plat en plastique de livraison, ajoute au manque de classe de cet établissement. Pour la décoration de l'endroit, on repassera. Une expérience décevante!"}
{"text":"This review is for the branch in the Mile End, but since there's no entry I'll piggyback it onto the NDG one.   Before the recent explosion of new restaurants in the Mile End, if you were really hungry and wanted some mass to force down your gaping maw you had precious few choices - Clarke sandwich shop, run to McDonald's on Parc and Mont Royal, or buy three cheesepies from Navarino and pound them into a multilayer pseudosandwich. Lunch hour was misery for the Ubisoft building, until B&M opened. All jokes about the name aside, the place was carefully crafted with a mission - large portions, reasonable prices, and variety. Everything on the menu is designed to satisfyingly stuff you - no ulterior motive. Just get in, eat, and get out.  That being said, it's really nicely decorated inside as well. Everything is white and bright, and it looks very clean and trendy to boot. Service is excellent and prices are reasonable. By the looks of it, the formula is perfect because it's mobbed during lunch hour and on weekends for brunch, as well. And deservedly so. Great spot, try it out."}
{"text":"The food was great, but I was disappointed with the service - we had some mix ups with our orders and on our bill and our waiter was really unfriendly. The place is always crowded during brunch time, but we were seated really fast.   Apart from that, the food was really good - had the American pancakes, definitely a recommodation!  The place would be my go-to-brunch-place if the service would be better."}
{"text":"my wife had a greek salad, it was terrible. it was a few leaves and then massive 3\" chunks of feta, tomato, cucumber, etc.. worst greek salad ever. my niece had fries, they were mccain frozen fries, nothing special. waitress was a bit sassy.  BUT THE BREAKFAST WAS GREAT. eggs were great, sausage was great, bacon was abundant, REAL hash browns made with potatoes and onions, crepe was nice. i would definitely go back for breakfast. SO much better than benedicts a few of blocks away. i give their traditional bacon & eggs type breakfast 5/5"}
{"text":"Where is my god damn fish and chips. All my friend are eating delicious food and I'm sitting here like a goon. What am I supposed to do? Nibble my damn thumb. Terrible. Just terrible."}
{"text":"This place used to have good pizza. Now it's garbage.  I also believe the reviews mentioning customers getting yelled at.  I've seen it happen.   Our waitress brought me a bottle of iced tea and a glass. When she went to pour it in the glass, she noticed some stuck-on crud near the top of glass. Instead of getting me a clean one, she scraped it off with her nail then poured my drink. Nasty.   I hear the breakfast is good. But I won't know, as I won't return."}
{"text":"gross! Waitresses making the toast/bagels! I don't want waitresses touching my food!"}
{"text":"Ordered my child the kids hamburger for $6 and asked for pickles on it. Got the bill and was charged $2 for a pickle. When I complained to the waitress she said that I should be happy because she should have charged us $4 for the pickles instead of $2 for her burger. 30% markup for pickles on your kids burger sounds a bit much"}
{"text":"We ate here twice in one week. Once for breakfast and once for lunch. The wait staff was welcoming and helpful.  The omelets are huge and good. The chicken club sandwich is tasty."}
{"text":"Maybe the best pizza delivery place in the NDG/Westmount area. They have fancier pizzas but even their plain cheese is delicious."}
{"text":"Nourriture très ordinaire, mais surtout, un service de livraison arrogant et inefficace, et les livreurs ne sont pas le problème."}
{"text":"Had the veggie burger with fries.  Not great, and way too much salt.  So much salt the fries in particular were inedible."}
{"text":"Rien de trop original. À l'évidence une formule à succès, file d'attente et bruit inclus. Service efficace même si l'endroit est un brin chaotique. Si vous rêvez d'un déjeuner à 1000 calories alors go!  Vous ne serez ni déçu, ni charmé."}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast and coffee. Very casual. Not mind blowing but good. I had bagel with lox and cream cheese. My friends' hash browns looked good, fruit on the side not impressive."}
{"text":"Come here often for breakfast/lunch. It's very popular in the mornings and the wait can be long as turnover is a little slow. Probably because its popular with young families with kids. The food is pretty good with good specials. I always leave full and satisfied. The staff is friendly but they do get overwhelmed and orders back up so during peak, expect delays."}
{"text":"This place is very busy & looked like a cute family friendly place for brunch w kids. Perhaps we got them on a bad Sunday but my family and I agreed to never return for the following reasons: 1) our waitress seemed to have no familiarity w the menu. When we ordered baked beans  she was surprised it was listed in the menu. Odd it's a brunch place right? 2) our food took a long time to arrive. Our daughter was getting very agitated as we're we.  They were simple brunch & lunch orders. Nothing special.  3) my plate didn't have bacon-though we got charged for it. I couldn't bother complaining as our waitress seemed at wits end keeping her head above water.  4) the food was super bland. Yawn.  5) the staff were not friendly but seemed stressed out by how busy the place was. It was busy but, so?   Would not recommend. There are other nicer brunch spots just 5 min away. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I would like everyone to know that the wait staff are for the most part attentive and helpful, this especially being the case with respect to an older lady who waits on the breakfast and brunch crowd on the weekends. I make sure to always thank her for her diligence and attentive service, and have always tipped her handsomely.   Now to relate my thoroughly unpleasant experience with the owner. First, some context: I work nearby and have been placing lunch and supper orders by phone to B & M over the last couple of years. Mainly burgers only, or the B & M burger special. Being a creature of habit, my orders are always the same (tomatoes and onions on top, ketchup & mayo, pickle on the side). The trouble began roughly a year ago when I noticed that the cook was placing the tomato slice on the bottom (below the patty), making the bread soggy and prone to easily falling apart, leaving me with a sopping mess. Furthermore, the pickle slices were in the burger, contrary to my order. The first couple of times, I transferred the tomato to the top, but was still left with a soggy bun bottom. On my third attempt (after this started) I asked the order taker to tell the cook to place the tomato on top of the patty and to ensure that the pickle was on the side. Instead, when having picked up the stapled paper bag for my order (and having seated myself in my workplace's kitchen), I found that the tomato and onions were on the side, and that the pickle was MIA.   I therefore resolved to ask for everything on the side for any future orders. This obviously must not have sat well with the cook or owner, as 2 out of three of my orders would have something amiss and/or always missing the pickle.   Last Thursday, I placed a phone order for pick-up with the owner herself, almost begging her to ensure that it actually turn out to be what I specifically ordered, and that the pickle not be missing. I picked up the stapled paper bag and (contrary to my instinct to open it in order to examine the contents) proceeded to go home. Upon opening the bag, I found to my consternation the the tomato slice had been placed bellow the patty, and that the mayo and ketchup had been substituted for mustard and relish (smeared on the bottom half of the bread bun) with the pickle once again MIA.  I called B & M yesterday and asked to speak to the owner. I identified myself, and proceeded to tell her about my dissatisfaction. Instead of apologizing and asking me how she could make things right, she said that she was too busy and slammed the phone on me. I called back 10 minutes later (giving her a face-saving excuse of \"the line must have cut off when you were speaking to me\") and asked for a credit for my last order. I could practically hear her fuming over the phone when she responded that she would deal with the issue only if I bothered showing up in person on that very day. Even though I only had a 30 minute break, I resolved to show up, just as she requested.   At 3:15PM sharp, I presented myself to her (the place was dead) and politely began to relate my story. Still, no apology. Instead, what I got from her was an earful of accusations that I was asking for a free meal (the nerve of her saying so, as I've dropped several hundred dollars on that place in the last few years!) and that I made \"strange requests\" - yes, apparently the owner of B & M finds it \"strange\" that someone may want their tomato slice on top of the patty, and their pickle present, and on the side. Pointing out to her that all I had expected from her when I had initially called to speak to her was an honest apology and a promise of resolution (in addition to my intention of subsequently placing a new order), and that instead I had been handled rudely and dismissively, she became increasingly confrontational and intransigent, saying that she refused to tell her cook to place the \"toppings\" on top.   To finish this long tale (apologies to everyone), after handing me my burger (tomato and onions on the side, but missing the pickle), she threatened my livelihood, telling me that the last person from my workplace to confront her was no longer working there, and that this should be food for thought for me. Lol  I truly feel for the people having to work for this terrible person. I've resolved to tell everyone that I know about my horrible experience, and wish that this lady takes her retirement as soon as possible. The neighbourhood will be a better place without her."}
{"text":"When you try to please everybody, you get basic food. Nothing amazing. If you order a savory crêpe, they will use the very sweet crêpe batter. Super gross with salty ingredients. Service is good. Fresh orange and grapefruit juice.  I guess this place works because it's really family/kid friendly."}
{"text":"Great brunch on the weekend. Arrive early to avoid the line-ups  2 eggs, bacon, ham & salami with two slices of french toast along with potatoes, toast and fruit for 11 bucks....you can't beat that"}
{"text":"A memorable breakfast experience.  My frittata, featuring guacamole and bacon, was splendid, and my wife's omelet was delicious. The home fries were fantastic, the best I've had in a while.  The service was warm and responsive."}
{"text":"Very reasonable diner fare.  Large portions so consider sharing (sharing charge may apply). eggs, omlets n pancakes all good.  Never had anything but  brunch. Busy on the weekends, especially on summer weekends."}
{"text":"This place is really just for takeout.    The takeout is great, they have a little of everything on a very large menu, including vegetarian options if that's what you are into.     Great pizza.     Go to the one on Somerled at Grand for breakfast, the food is really good."}
{"text":"We've been here and ordered from it enough to know this.....no matter what you order, you'll like it and the delivery is fast. That's pretty impressive, really.    We finally went for breakfast one morning  - didn't really expect miracles from where we order pizza and subs from, but we took a shot. Prices were fair but the food....they had a twist on eggs benny called avocado and goat cheese - the plate was GORGEOUS, an entire half of a perfectly green, ripe avocado on top and everything just melted in my mouth.   We often talk about that dish and will go back for it."}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in town! Good value, huge options, great menu and friendly staff. I can't ever get enough of B&M and I often see local celebrities there enjoying a hearty breakfast.  They are open for lunch and supper as well and have daily specials that are savory and good value. You will live this place and keep coming back.  It takes all payment forms (cash, debit, credit). Good for kids and small groups. Gets noisy at lunch or weekend brunch. Clean, casual, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place does not even need words to describe how good it is when you have these awesome photos customers took.   Highly recommended breakfast place that doubles as a work lunch or casual dining.   They accept cash, debit, credit. Okay to come with kids. Okay for small-medium groups. Service is fast and courteous. Value is good, and the menu is great!   Gets pretty noisy when it's busy, which is lunch time on week days and brunch on weekends."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here, all of the staff are very friendly. The service is courteous and efficient. The food couldnt get any better quality wise, its always fresh and delicious. Definitely a spot that I enjoy going on any cold morning occasion. Lets not forget how cozy it is. A+++"}
{"text":"Excellent resto de quartier de brunchs, avec un large choix de plats brunchs et même des burgers, poutines, sandwichs, etc.., à prix modérés. La bouffe est fraiche et de qualité (avocat mûr mais pas trop, fruits murs, etc..) Excellent service, staff très courtois Seul hic, entre 11h et 13h il y a vraiment beaucoup de monde, alors le service est assez lent... plus d'une demie-heure d'attente pour son plat... Il faut le savoir... A essayer!"}
{"text":"Decided to pick up a pizza after reading good reviews. It's definitely a step above most pizza places, but having been to Italy recently it didn't wow me. I also found it a bit pricey at $20. I wouldn't want to eat in at this location, it's small and kind of dingy. Nothing fancy about it at all, except maybe the awning outside.   All in all I'd order again when the mood strikes, but I'd rather just save my money and make it at home."}
{"text":"Consistent. Service is always friendly. Drip coffee is not too bad. The breakfast potatoes have nice bits of vegetables in them, but salt is an issue. The fruit is usually ripe and fresh."}
{"text":"Terrible place for brunch. The food was so standard. It tasted so bland and it was such a boring environment. I ordered a spinach and mozzarella sand which with breakfast potatoes on the side. The sandwiches don't even come with anything, I had to order a side dish. Their breakfast potatoes weren't even that good. Who messes up breakfast potatoes?! The sandwich came in this clunky plate with so much place to spare but they brought the potatoes on a separate plate for no reason. The sandwich had a pickle on top but that was pretty much it for presentation.  It was such a careless restaurant with a staff that was unenthusiastic.   I was there to catch up with a friend and they were making so much noise I couldn't hear her most of the time.   I'm going to give this place a 2 stars because the food was adequate and I'm assuming the waiter was having a bad day. I had a good time but that was mostly because I was there with a friend and we had a lovely time.  I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't recommend it"}
{"text":"I found this Place by accident one day and took a chance. Well a chance well taken. Amazing quality of food and the staff provide superior service. If you go, tell them Texas sent you!"}
{"text":"Cute place for brunch. I had an omelet (asparagus and cheese) with a side of bagels (I swapped the toasted bread for them) - it was a perfectly cooked omelet but the potatoes that accompany it needed some sauce on top. My friends got the crepes and they looked very interesting. I loved the decor and the service too."}
{"text":"Excellent eggs Benedict!  Loved our waiter.  Great experience!  Only suggestion, offer refills on hot water for the tea."}
{"text":"Had the burger, girlfriend had the Frittata. She was very pleased with her selection but let me tell you this, that was the best god damn burger I have ever eaten in my entire burger eating life! A MUST EAT! Prices are reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem of NDG!. Been living in this neighborhood and passing by this restaurant for the past 5 years, I finally decided to give it a shot last Saturday. The restaurant is quite cozy with little to no decors. It doesn't have any hip vibe like any brunch joint in Plateau. Let's just keep it real here, I had the eggs benedict and steak and the steak is the bomb . The steak is well cooked for less than $20! My brother have the London steak with eggs which only costs $11. For the price we pay, the food was absolutely delicious :)."}
{"text":"I walked into this restaurant not knowing what to expect. My friends and I were walking by and noticed the place was pretty full so I used my normal assumption that when a place is full, it must be good... and it was. It was more than good (except for maybe the coffee). I had Avocat et Chévre (might be misspelling it. I know 0 french). It was a version of Eggs Benedict with an avocado housing a perfeclty cooked poached egg and goat cheese instead of Canadian bacon. The avocado and goat cheese with the runny egg yolk just worked. If you are here, this is what you must eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant had many options to choose from; it could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. Their vegetarian omelet was very delicious! They had large portions and were decently priced. Their coffee was very good also. This restaurant had a terrace that you could eat outside. The only unfortunate thing about it was that it faces the street and on a windy day when the cars drive by all the dirt and dust will fly in your face. Otherwise, there's good service, good food, and good options."}
{"text":"We had brunch there, I had the Italian hot burger and my wife had two eggs and bacon. Everything was mediocre. I thought if we ordered simple things they couldn't really screw it up. All the ingredients were cheep and i felt like the restaurant chose quantity over quality. I can't speak for the more expensive items on the menu or the pizza. Maybe I should have gotten that."}
{"text":"The food is alright, though not what B & M used to be. Service, however, is awful. We ordered pizza for delivery and waited 70 minutes before it arrived, cold.  When I called to complain, the woman on the phone yelled at me and told me I was lying about the food being cold.   Though they don't sell the worst pizza in the area, the attitude and terrible service is enough for me to delete them from my roster."}
{"text":"Great delivery food, awful management. Since charge $14 for a club sandwich, you'd think they can afford to have a debit machine for each driver. The old lady who answer the phone should be kept away from customers."}
{"text":"First time in this place, on a Sunday lunch hour.  Very, very busy. Nice decor, except for the tv's everywhere but that a so modern disease of having tv in every restaurant.  Good wise had a salmon bagel, very good. Came with very tasty hash potatoes and fruit, not enough fruit to my taste but hey, it's fall and I guess the price of fruit has gone up after summer.  Much better than Cora, plus bilingual staff who won't be outraged and traumatized if you speak English ;-)  Be prepared to wait if you want a table and are a party of 4, there is counter seating too.  Worth the wait, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've had some really delicious breakfast experiences at this restaurant. The atmosphere is really pleasant, and the restaurant itself is very clean, which is always something to appreciate. The food itself was delicious (though the breakfast potatoes could definitely stand to be crispier in my opinion!). I'll definitely be returning again soon."}
{"text":"I lived in NDG for a couple years and loved B&M.  It's not exactly gourmet but some of the items on the menu really hit the spot like the pizzas, sandwiches, and pasta. Their fries&, however, always came either fresh and crispy or old and soggy.  I was happy to find out that they still deliver to me even though I'd moved. Regardless, my partner tonight was seriously craving chocolate/any dessert and we hopped on Yelp to find a place this open since it was 10:30pm. That's when I remembered B&M and we jumped in the car and went. She got the chocolate cake and I got the caramel & carrot cheesecake (after battling between the strawberry cheesecake and carrot cake) and they were simply amazing."}
{"text":"The spot is one of my favourite go-to-eat place for week end morning. I also went a couple times for dinner meeting with new clients. The decor is modern and well executed. I really liked how they played with the dark and bright furniture.  The food is good. I went more then 10 times and I never had any problems at all. Service is quick, i always get served by the same lady every weekend, she is very nice.  The ambiance is not too loud, perfect for conversations. Very lightful too. Some parking on Bernard, and around in the neiberhood, I always find spots, don't worry about that one.   Free WIFI, that's always a plus for meetings. The tables are quite big, they can accept two or three laptops.   Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is getting bad reviews, if you ask me It should have at least 4 stars over all. It's always packed, line ups usually which says a lot about the place.  I go here for breakfast all the time and the food is amazing! No complaints there. So many different options. And GREAT pancakes. I usually get the eggs Benedict, or if I feel like Being healthy the scrambled eggs where you get to chose your ingredients. The service as well is very good. Keep in mind it gets very very busy there so the waiters are in the juice-but that doesn't stop them from giving great service."}
{"text":"This outpost of the NDG original is definitely an A-Ok option in the neighborhood. Kind of white and chic for St Viateur, but the burger is $6 and the sweet potato fries are heaping and delicious. The pickles need some serous work - c'mon. A tiny mangled gherkin just hurts my heart. Don't even say there will be a pickle if that's what you mean by pickle. I don't think that word means what you think it means. Le sigh. Aside from that, friendly service, attentive with the water and napkins, not bad at all."}
{"text":"A good breakfast, but perhaps not quite amazing.  There was a pretty huge line to get in on a Sunday breakfast.  It was pretty busy, we waited about 25 mins for a table for four.  Food was good. Standard breakfast items abound.  The eggs benedict (or the version we had) was just okay.  Pancakes were pretty good, but again, like all the other stuff, not overly memorable.  Coffee was pretty average.   Service was pleasant, even though the food took a while to show.  Nothing wrong here. Just not fabulous.  Not sure why it had a 25 minute wait considering the other food options nearby.  I'd return, but I wouldn't wait that long next time."}
{"text":"They are not nice. I asked that half of my sub be wrapped to take home.  The server then informed me that they threw it in the garbage by mistake.  Did they try to compensate us in any way by maybe not charging us for the pie dessert? No.  Not even an apology."}
{"text":"Rude and unfriendly service. Which is a shame because the food was quite good and the prices reasonable. I really don't understand why the waitress was so unnecessarily hostile."}
{"text":"Horrible service so the food better be good. Well it isn't let me tell you. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had actually got what I ordered. They mafia lady on the phone forced me to have something I did not order. When they sent me the wrong thing and I called them out for it  said something like I believe I wanted to have bacon on it and she said and I'm not even joking \"no you don't\" I was like I think I do and she said no you don't and I was like ooooook. The food is really mediocre. It's not disgusting but seeing how bad the service and how long they take to bring it, it really leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I'll also go for the Mile end branch. I would recommend this place for brunch only. It's more joyful and you'll notice by the line that it's more popular a Saturday morning! I was with a friend who had a one year old. Even though the place was packed, there was enough room for the baby.  Not a big discovery but the food was ok. I had 2 eggs and didn't finish my plate. Yes, the portions are quite generous!  Hmmm..the service was very friendly. Maybe it was because of the little Chloe: she was so adorable :)"}
{"text":"Great meal after a mishap with the Bagel. We went to this Bagel Place called St. Viatur thinking you get Bagel with spread and well some coffee or chocolate but this is not the place for that. Just buy your Bagel and leave with the option of buying a whole tub of spread..... anyways we ended up and the B&M. The food was great, Waffle Benedict awesome and the avocado Goat Cheese Benedict as well. Very pretty presentation. Nice atmosphere, very attentive staff. If you don't speak French do not worry, they have English menus as well. I would definitely come back here. Ahhh they don't rush you to leave as some restaurants in the US."}
{"text":"Great pizza but pricey. Slow delivery. Cranky woman answers phone don't be surprised if she hangs up phone loudly in your ear. . Other food mediocre."}
{"text":"Wonderful food with bright lively interior. I love their menu - everything you want from a good brunch place. All the classics and nothing too complicated or strange. Good brunch food for a great price.   Now what really earns them the five star review is their service. We had the liveliest happiest waiter and it seemed to be an infectious spirit throughout the restaurant.When you feel happy you will enjoy the food even more. I would like to note that they had technically closed the kitchen but my friend had ordered a burger without realizing they didn't come with fries. He asked the waiter and without even hesitation the waiter said it's not a problem. Absolutely loved their attitude and were so accommodating.   Really lovely place! Looking forward to going back and laughing and feasting on a pile of pancakes."}
{"text":"New administration ... restaurant not up to par as old B & M restaurant....will give them more time, as a client who has been going for several years once a week, so far they don't want to keep the old clients happy."}
{"text":"Although there's nothing wrong with their brunch fare, there is nothing remarkable either. Nothing is particularly good or particularly bad. The coffee is as mediocre as the service. This is a local brunch spot and you'll see many families there with their young children (gets loud).  The decor is very clean and minimal with a lovely open bar/kitchen section. Overall a very mediocre brunch, if you're in a pinch B&M will do. They are not lacking for different breakfast options and you'll definitely be able to find something to eat. But there is nothing oustanding and it's all in all a very mediocre brunch spot."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Montreal. Love the pancakes, friendly service and consistent food. Not the most original or exceptional taste, but a good brunch always to set a tone for a good weekend."}
{"text":"I went there early Sunday morning, being extremely hungry. My boyfriend ordered the \"Ventre creux\" (two pancakes, enormous amount of all kinds of meat, two eggs, potatoes) but, I have to admit, I finished most of his plate, to the surprise of our waiter. The service was excellent. I base this review on the most important service skill in the morning: pouring coffee in my cup every two minutes until I start shaking. The food was also good. Since every breakfast food taste alike in most restaurants, I always base the rating of the brunch places on the potatoes. These ones were a bit spicy and sautéed with oignons, very yummy. The pancakes were delicious. The only thing I would say is that there was not enough bread on the side (I am indeed a bread lover)... by that I mean that there was not enough bread to manage both the egg-yellow bursting and my craving for peanut butter toasts that morning."}
{"text":"Excellent at the price point, great service, comfortable and fast. Free WiFi. Go B&M!"}
{"text":"Closed for renovations.  Seem major. Came by for brunch but...Hope they are back soon."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while. Truly one of the best and most consistent breakfast places in montreal. Staff and owners are very friendly. I've tried everything on the menu and have never been remotely disappointed. My favorite is the egg benedicts with avocado and goat cheese."}
{"text":"The first thing you have to understand is this place runs a certain way and you'll be a fan ir not. If you're just ordering the food, it's delicious so move on and ignore the rest of the review. B&M is not a sit down location, the other branches are but not this one despite it having five or six tables. The owners are in every day and can be very rude and loud, they will often scream and shout at their staff while you're sitting there eating. Tge delivery druvers come in and out constantly, the phones never stop ringing but the food and atmosphere are great.   The food is a few steps above fast food but a few behind fine dining. The pizza is amazing (local personality Terry Demonte says it's his favorite) and the chicken fingers are to die for. The servings are huge and filled with ingredients and you're normally served quite quickly. The hustle and bustle make it a great place to see how a resto works and you get quite the view of Sherbrooke and it's pedestrians."}
{"text":"This is a lovely eating destination if you're not looking for anything too out of the box. Brunch or lunch, they have the basics covered, like omelettes, benedicts, club sandwiches and Angus burgers. I've been here twice and both times I had their sandwich au poulet grillé, which is a lovely ensemble of good ciabatta bread, generous slices of avocado (yay!), tender grilled chicken and perfectly sized tomato slices and lettuce. The fries are quite decent and at $3 a bowl, it's big enough to share with a friend. From the outside, the place looks rather upscale (minimalist style decor, black and white), but the price is reasonable for what you get. Service can be slow, but if you're not in a hurry, it's not such a bad thing since it's a cosy place to just chill out and watch the Mile End world go by outside."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Montreal. Staff is kind and very nice. The food is not pretentious but I have never been deceived by the quality of the food.  Lunch food is also really good (try the steak and fries, really good )"}
{"text":"Location is good and ambiance is simplistic. We went there for brunch  and we had multiple things. First the coffee was very good the foam on my capuccino was thick and tasty. I had avocado toast and sweet potato fries. It was simple and delicious. My friends enjoyed their brunch as well. The chicken sandwich was just ordinary."}
{"text":"Wifi zone, coffee is cheap, only 1.25 dollar you can grab a fresh brewed coffee . The decor ian white and clean, simple and concise. A good place to take a rest"}
{"text":"An OK brunch from this Montreal chain.  We had a couple of great breakfast sandwiches (the Montreal bagel is much better when warm or in this case toasted).  My sandwich has cream cheese and lox.  Thought the lox to cream cheese ratio was a little low and when I ordered the side of sweet potato fries there was really no salt on the fries.  Not sure my favorite place but was worth a try."}
