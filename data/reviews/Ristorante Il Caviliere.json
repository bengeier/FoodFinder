{"text":"It was just okay. Typical hotel food but our server gave us very good  service. We  had  the  lasagna  and  all you  can  eat muscles.  The  muscles lacked  the  flavour  and  you  could only  have  one choice of sauce.  The lasagna  was runny but  the noodles  were perfectly prepared."}
{"text":"Food was okay and the service was decent.  I don't know if tip is included or not, but our bill came out to $40 when both items ordered were $15/$16. I still tipped the 15% so the total came out to $47 dollars for two plates of pasta! Probably would be 3 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I waaay overpaid for this meal. There are plenty of better food options within a few blocks walk."}
