{"text":"We were first intrigued by the Sonoran Dog, and had it without onions. While we were waiting for it to be finished, the owner talked to us. He was very friendly, but seemed to feel the need to oversell his achievements. This made me feel a bit uneasy at first, as usually insecurity or incompetence is covered with excess bravado. I decided to give him a chance. 

He told us that on www.roaminghunger.com he was rated 7-10/114 regularly and had 5 stars on yelp. A check later on didn't even have his truck listed on the website, and yelp gave a 3.5/5... 

Our dog came with a tiny amount of blackened crumbles of bacon on the bottom. The dog itself was small and burnt beyond edible. We ended up tossing it after one taste, a perfect waste of money. It looked nothing like the picture."}
{"text":"Absolutely the greatest hotdog I've ever had!   The owner was super friendly, and took his time perfecting each hotdog. The buns are fresh, and every ingredient compliments one another. Definitely will keep following them to events they are at! 
*I recommend the Hawaiian or Sonoran dog!!"}
{"text":"Pissed. I followed the location beam on Yelp and never found them in the Olive Business Park. I went to the actual address listed on Yelp. A dump of a strip mall. I EVEN called the number listed and got a man's voice mail. Left a message, no recall..... No mention on the phone message of actually being a Voodoo Dog place, I will never, ever try to find or eat from this place again."}
{"text":"Passing through a shopping center in early march, I came across this cart. Very good. Owner nice and is a fellow Texan.  Will eat here again"}
{"text":"Beware of this company!  I booked the food truck for our 30 year reunion and put down a $300 deposit.  The event was cancelled outside of a month and they are refusing to return my deposit.  The owner told me if I cancelled outside of 2 weeks my deposit was refundable.  Now I am out $300 of my own money.  Not the best way to do business Saul.  And I am a business owner as well and would never do business this way."}
{"text":"The best dog I have ever had! My husband and I are from NY, and look forward to these every time we visit. The owner is beyond friendly, and I love that his kids help out at the cart. My favorite hot dog is the Sonoran, and their original(The Voodoo)! The buns are fresh which is seriously unheard of. SO AMAZING."}
{"text":"Had VooDoo dogs while at the west valley food truck round up on 1/22/16. My wife and I both got the Sonoran Dog  and our daughter just a plain dog and they were awesome! The buns were fresh soft and sweet. The dogs had a good snap and were delicious and all of the toppings were amazing! It was a little spicy but wasn't overpowering. I could have eaten 10 of them! The price was good and included a drink and chips. I want to try all of the other dogs I think the Hawaiian is my next pick or the namesake Voodoo dog! I'm excited to try all the different options!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like hot dogs? 

Mystery cuts of meat throw-away, sluiced & squeezed into a phallic form--in a way, it's Ouroboros of Man eating his own \"tail\" so to speak--that ancestral Gods would nod appreciatively to. 

With almost as much versatility as the wheel or Betty White ( love my Golden Girl ), hard to mess up & difficult to perfect, the Hot Dog is the under appreciated meal substitute to white linen dining. 

I had the signature Voodoo Dog, and if you've never had it for breakfast, give it a try sometime. Filling but not that thanksgiving kinda full when you feel the need to purge & pray. 

Saul ( Goodman? ), the guy knows his market, good product and the way to return business is customer service. Hit all points. 

When you're just craving a Voodoo Dog, you know who you need to call: Better Call Saul."}
{"text":"Checked out the farmers market and wanted some breakfast. Although there were a few food truck/cart options I decided on Voodoo hot dogs. I ordered the namesake Voodoo dog and wasn't disappointed. A delicious mix of fresh veggies and sauce that accentuated the all beef dog. Soft bun that really held it all together (pun intended)."}
{"text":"Had the Sonoran dog at food truck Friday. 4-29-16. Great dog. The bun was perfect. The bacon was big chunks. I usually like it more crumbled. Everything else tied in perfect. The kicker is the tomatillo sauce. Not to hot but full of flavor. Needles to say I had to have a few. Lol. I strongly recommend them if you love a good Sonoran dog. I will try their other dogs next time."}
{"text":"Hot dogs were so yummy!  I had the sonoran dog and it did not disappoint. It was just a tad too spicy for my liking, I love spicy things, but this just almost burned my lips off. My brother-in-law had the Hawaiian dog and I think he's still dreaming of wanting another.   Just wish we didn't have to wait so long to get our hot dogs. In all they were delicious and I would definitely buy another hot dog from Voodoo Dogs"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this food stand at Food Truck Friday West a couple weeks ago and loved their hot dogs!  We both got the Voodoo Dog - the combination of the spicy bourbon sauce and cucumber relish was amazing!  My only wish is that the bun would have been a little more toasted because with all the stuff on it, the bun got a little soggy.  Overall, we're both excited to try more of their hot dogs.

Edit: Went here again to try a different hot dog.  I got the Hawaiian Kona dog and, as I mentioned before, I wish the buns were more toasted.  Because of the pineapple and toppings on this one, when I tried to pick the hot dog up to eat it (less than a minute after receiving it), the bun squished and basically disintegrated into a soppy mess.  I ended up basically just eating the hot dog and toppings.  I'd probably go with just a plain dog from now on with maybe just some ketchup and mustard."}
{"text":"Best hot dogs I've found in the Phoenix area. Homemade buns and all beef dogs. Build it your way or try one of their custom flavors. The voodoo dog is fantastic."}
{"text":"I tried the Chicago dog last weekend and I could't eat it fast enough. I will defiantly get another next weekend at the farmers market. Nice Job on a well prepared product."}
