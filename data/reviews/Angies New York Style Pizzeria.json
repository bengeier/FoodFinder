{"text":"New to Ohio and wanted local pizza.  Seriously amazing!! Best pizza I've had in a long while."}
{"text":"Omg!  This place has turned awful.  First, let me tell you I am not a negative person.  Matter of fact I am one of the people that is on their actual web-site that raved about their food and gave them a perfect score.  Well, tonight will be the last night I will ever order again.  I was telling my family how great this place was, and I have not ordered for months and would like to start again.  I went online to order,no matter who I order from I always call afterwards to make sure they get my orders (Computers can cause problems).  Well, I called and I asked the owner did he get my order and gave him my full name.  He said, \"Yes, got it right here.\"  Ok, I said.  Well, 40 minutes go by and I thought just in case I will call to make sure he had it.  I called and asked where my order was and he said he never got it.  I told him \"You said you got it.\"  He said he got me confused with another person with the same first name.  He never apologized and even offer any discount.  I could tell he did not give a crap about making the mistake and even after I told him I have kids that needed to get to bed and were waiting for the food he still did not care (what does he care they are not his kids.)  My kids were upset they wanted to eat and go to bed.   He could tell I was very frustrated but again could care less.  Well, I ordered the food and went to pick it up.  Again, when I got there he never apologized or he even offered a free cheesecake.  He showed me the screen of a person who had the same first name as me, but I told him I gave you my full name.  Again, he looked at me like, \"tough luck.\"  I said to him, \"You should apologize.\"  Again, he looked at me like, \"blank off\" and walked outside to smoke a cigarette.  I think he was paying too much attention watching the Cavaliers on TV versus paying attention to his customers.  So, I got the food home and it was undercooked and disgusting.  My kids said the food was gross and it was.  It was so gross that I dumped all the food (which cost me $50) and went to McDonald's.  McDonalds tasted better than Angie's and that is bad lol!   So, he made a mistake, was rude and did not care about the customer and the food was revolting....so this is my last stop ever here.  He got my $50, but will never see another penny from me who once was a loyal customer for a long time and was coming back to be a loyal again.... but that will never happen.  The owner has to learn to admit the mistake, apologize and make the food correct.  He needs to realize that there are many other places that people can go to.  A simple. \"I am sorry\" and cooked food would have been nice"}
{"text":"Crust-not as delicate and airy. 3
Sauce -above average
Cheese-kind of gummy. I wonder if they use the presheredded  stuff with cellulose
Toppings -sausage and ricotta. I love this combo. Bonus for having ricotta. Toppings were very good.
Great for take-out."}
{"text":"Just checking back in!  Food is delicious, sandwiches and pizza are fantastic! Best pizza in all of cleveland!"}
{"text":"Wow! I ordered on Yelp complete with beverage & had it delivered - perfect! Smooth, easy accurate and fast!  Delivery estimate was spot on and less than one hour from when I ordered.  Food was amazing!!! OMG!!!  I got a stuffed pizza sandwich which is a regular pizza with another crust on top with Parmesan?, garlic and herbs.  Oh, oh, oh this is just amazing.  Eat in, pick up or delivery - Wonderful"}
{"text":"Just picked up my Pizza and it was delicious! Super cheesy! Got a Calzone too! Calzone was hands down the best Iv ever had!!"}
{"text":"Great family owned pizza restaurant, the pizza dough is always fresh and hand tossed toppingd are fresh and the prices are reasonable.  The answer salad that have is delicous and a nice twist on the usual salad, comes with meatballs, fries and there amazing house made creamy italian dressing. I live just down the steet from them and have been eating there pizza for the last 6 years and have pretty much tried everything on there menu and have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"We order here all the time, great food and super nice staff. Delivery pretty quick and ordering online is better!"}
{"text":"The most delicious pepperoni roll I've ever had! Their slices are HUGE and delicious. I want to dip everything in their creamy Italian dressing. They're always so pleasant and accommodating."}
{"text":"I ordered online , and didn't get delivered for 1 1/2 hrs, I love angies pizza, but their online ordering & delivery is verrrrry slooow! This is not the 1st time this has happened either, I keep telling myself I'll give it one more try, well this is my last try, Never again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The answer salad is a must it is something that me and my husband get and share it has amazing flavor that makes each bite a party in you mouth. The portions are great you get what you pay for. We have only tried 3 pizzas and they were. All amazing mentor on the lake , suburban and the stuffed pizza are amazing and we r sure to get them again this is a great spot for a movie night a home or even a party. Don't forget you mozz moons if your a cheese lover like me you will in head over heels in love I always get two orders one for me and the other for my husband they are that good. Must try and will return"}
{"text":"Pizza is very saucy.  Didn't taste good at all.  Makes sense why this place is always empty when I go in there."}
{"text":"Previously said it was the best, tonight not so much! Hopefully something was wrong in the kitchen and will be fixed next time"}
{"text":"My husband wanted to give Angies another try last night since it was usually so good.  I didn't try it this time since I wasn't feeling good. He and my Mom said the pizza was perfect/excellent.  Tonight we just ordered the chopped salad to go with last nights leftover pizza.  Hoping its good.  I just wish when I called and complained last time I would have heard from one of the owners/managers.  We prefer to spend our money at Mom. & Pop type places but we also expect Mom & Pop service and courtesy."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the MOL without question, top 5 in Mentor, and one of the best pizzas in NEO. Very reasonable prices and friendly staff. Take out / delivery only."}
{"text":"I ordered through their website and my order was immediately canceled without explanation, after my card was charged. It is not saying it could take up to 7 days to refund me. Now looking at their yelp this has happened to other people as well. If you don't wish to take online delivery orders please update your website! It's frustrating to be charged, and then have the order canceled without explanation. I'm guessing I may have been out of their delivery zone as I am about 5 miles away, if that's the case they should fix their website to show which areas are not included."}
{"text":"Love love LOVE their pizza!! I love the fact that it is a family owned place. The guys working are always nice, easy to laugh & joke with. 

I just wish they were as less expensive."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying their food.

Placed an order for delivery. Order was cancelled with no explanation."}
{"text":"Good food best pizza and saucy wings the small pizzas was as big as a dominoes medium. extra large can feed 4 people easy the wings are good"}
