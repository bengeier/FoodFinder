{"text":"Je ne repousserai plus: le goût est correct mais pas mieux que SHI TANG, pas de breuvage chaud, et pas assez pour moi. Après de mangé, j'achète un gâteau de pâtisserie en face à ajouter."}
{"text":"40 mins waiting for a la carte...Srsly? Orderd only two hot meals and rice...And this food was disgusting. To be honest, I am not quit sure what it was that I was eating. Waste time and money."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Chinese restaurant in MTL. Every time I go to this place, I always order their combo. This time I ordered Dry Wok, they put shrimps, pork, chicken wings and vegetables in a pot. It tastes like a dry hot pot lol. I have never tried this kind of Chinese food before, it was incredible! if you have no idea what you can get, ask the staff to help you out, they have a lot of tasty things available."}
{"text":"After long hours of study, I was hungry, too cold to go outside, no time to seat and order at a restaurant. Need something good and fast. Quality/ Price. Mr.Gao dayum LOL  Right in between library and MB building inside Guy-Concordia Metro station.  I was clueless as usual. Staff explained me how it works and offer me the combo option.  Choose a rice/ noodle, veggies/ tofu and meat. + Free lime water (thumbs up) High variety of dishes, good portion, good quality. I chose veggies fried rice, TOFU (vegetables LOL) and some pan-fried beef.  They accept MasterCard and Tap (Thumbs up)  Food was great, fills you up.  When I was done eating, I didn't know where to put my tray. One of the staff walked towards me and took the tray. (Customer service level too high haha)  You can also order fancy individual dishes (pictures on wall) Good ambiance, Good for 1-4 people group  I will definitely come back to try the other meat options. Keep the good job!"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that can be found in the Guy-Concordia tunnel right by the Guy street exit of the metro, I think they opened in the summer.   I've been a few times and I must say that I'm a fan! It's one of the few places where you can get a combo plate of Chinese food (rice or noodle, choice of veges or tofu, and a choice of meat for $8.95) in the area. It's great because usually I like to try a mix of different things and this is a great way to do that when you're just alone or with a friend. The decor is new, the service is alright, and the food has been fresh each time that I've went. Considering the fact that it's 20% off everything after 6pm, the value-to-price ratio for dinner here is pretty high!   I find it's super convenient if you're a student at Concordia as the next best Chinese food restaurants are a few blocks away on Ste Catherine. Just beware, I've come a few times close to closing and half the things on the buffet were finished. (They'll make it fresh for you if you don't mind waiting 5-10 minutes though.). Overall, a nice option for quick food if you're in the area."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the Concordia neighbourhood.  Authentic Chinese, but not as hard core authentic as the nearby and well loved Shi Tang.  I've had lunch here twice.  The first lunch was the \"cafeteria\" style lunch where you chose 3 items.  The tofu choice was particularly good.  My second lunch was the fried egg and bbq pork... I see myself grabbing this quite often as I work nearby; there is something to be said about rice and a fried egg!  Hassle free credit card payments, a rarity for the Chinese places in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Not a good first impression. Had the 7.99$ \"Minced beef noodles\". Mediocre dish. Barely enough sauce. Noodles overcooked and flavorless. I heard their american-chinese food is decent, but that's not what I'm into. This place is inauthentic and not worth it for me."}
{"text":"Located right inside the guy-concordia metro, Mr.Gao is one of the best cafeterias to stop by for a quick lunch. Their regular combos are hearty and well-varied, perfect for lunch. In addition to the combo dishes, there is also a regular dinner menu with dishes like spicy boiled fish and ???. The rice noodle soups are very good and worth a try if you ever come. If you ever need help ordering something, just ask the staff and they will be happy to help you. :)"}
{"text":"Overall it is a decent express Chinese restaurant. Unlike other similar kind, this one is clean and spacious.  The express food combo is good with large portion. I ordered rice noodle. It comes with fish squid and fake crab meat. I like it even though it was too spicy for me.  I found the bowl is not clean. That why it loses one star."}
{"text":"I did notice a few people eating the mixed Wok pot that one of the reviewers mentioned. I think I'll need to try that next time. In the meantime, the reason behind my middle of the road rating is this;   In a nut shell, I was craving a good pre-dinner snack, so I ordered one of my favourite simple and easy Chinese-go-to's: Sliced BBQ Pork with rice (and in this case it came with two over easy fried eggs, plus some broccoli and some splashes of soy - I assume - sauce).   The issue was the thick meaty slices of meat in the photo were not what arrived. What I received was very fatty and much thinner than the slices pictured. It was so different that I presented it to the server and then the manager/owner. After a friendly back and forth discussion, he diligently returned my plate to the kitchen. A little while later he pleasantly returned it with a better looking selection of slices. Not to the level of the photo, but definitely an improvement.   It turned out to be flavourful, and with eggs over rice became pretty darn filling. The one other issue was the broccoli became stone cold. I needed my greens, so I ate them, but would have been nicer, if warmed up.   Ironically a guy at the next table had ordered the same thing (his was even thicker and meatier than even my replacement), so hmm - the reason I was given for the fat, and this may explain the two other dishes is that they started cutting from the edge of a new piece and the fat, gave way to more meaty slices as they kept slicing inwards. If so, they should try to keep the plates looking relatively the same, or change the photo to match the average portion supplied.  Overall, this place reminded me of certain Chinese quick serve places I'd seen in my travels, neat, modern and enticing. As I began my review, now I'm really craving that mixed Wok pot."}
