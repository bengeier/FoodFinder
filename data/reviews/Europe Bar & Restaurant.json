{"text":"This is a great restaurant if you love a great big Weiner Snitchzel. I used to go the Hungarian restaurants on Bloor St. but they all seem to have closed. My entire family love it -even my picky son who has the chicken snitchzel -guess it's like a really big chicken finger to him! The breading is so light  and the portions are great. Took my Hungarian parents and they now go all the time. It's a bit if a hole in the wall but the food and prices are unbeatable!"}
{"text":"The Europe is a lot like The Country Style on Bloor West, but with more space to move around in. (Which is useful after eating their food.)  Hungarian food has fallen out of favour with health conscious people, With good reason, the portions are enormous and heavy on the meat and grease. It used to be popular with poor students but is no longer particularly cheap or vegetarian friendly. The restaurants on Bloor between Spadina and Bathurst are mostly all gone, replaced by sushi restaurants. I'm glad the Europe on Lawrence and Bathurst is still upholding the tradition. The food is great! you can get schnitzel with dumplings, goulash, cheese noodles, strudel and palacinta (a crepe with walnuts or jam inside)."}
{"text":"The food tastes really homemade :) I had the goulash which was super tasty and the chicken paprikash- both really good! The server was very sweet and friendly too. My only issue was that the dubonet I ordered came in a pretty dusty glass but the server apologized right away and brought me a new one when I told her."}
{"text":"Ive been to this restaurant numerous times and till this day still get the chicken schnitzel with the home fries, cucumber salad and the cherry streusel for dessert but the best appetizer to get is the most amazing fried cheese it is absolutely the best thing I've had in my whole life l love going there it is one of my favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp while visiting Toronto and went there for lunch on a Sunday. The menu was typical Eastern European. We ordered the platter for four to share among 4 adults and 2 young kids. The stack of meat on the platter was quite impressive. The cabbage rolls which came with the platter were excellent. I particularly liked the broth which I soaked up with the rye bread. The schnitzel and pork chops were tender and tasty, seasoned and cooked just right. The pickled cucumber slices although on the sweet side were also quite good. All of us including the kids enjoyed our meal very much.

I should also give kudos to our server, one person taking care of the almost full restaurant, she took care of all our needs."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating here last week. The decor could use some updating though I appreciated the charm of the Hungarian style. 
The food was very tasty and plentiful. I had Wiener schnitzel which was accompanied by little dumplings and sauce.
I think the cucumber salad could use some help so I didn't eat it.  Some little things could help them, for example if they were to bring my Pepsi with a glass. Just classier than bringing a can of pop to the table with a straw.
My guests had the paprikash and perogies.  Very nice. Presentation could improve slightly as well.
Bathroom needs a complete Reno."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience of my life.
Made a reservation and upon arrival a server wanted to seat us at one of the tables. Another server cuts in and says we can't sit there and puts us right next to the door where the cold drafts were coming in. Another couple without a reservation came 10 minutes later and got seated in the area where we were originally going to sit.
We waited over an hour for the food and the waiter became hostile and argumentative when the food was served cold and we asked to speak with the owner. When asked for her name she muttered some retort and walked off.
Have never been to a restaurant with such an unwelcoming atmosphere and treatment of customers is so scornful and discourteous."}
{"text":"Lightning does not strike twice!.
While our first experience was a success, the 2nd visit was the opposite.

The friendly attentiveness was gone. The waitress we had was either new or did not care (apology at the end for a tip is not an apology, and therefor no tip was delivered either). 

Firstly we did not have a \"reservation\". Although the restaurant was busy, we were seated in the worse spot by the door to receive drafts, while subsequent customers got interior tables as there was still available tables.

We did not get the bread and butter that is served. Nor a bread plate. Despite all other tables receiving it, and having received it on our previous visit.

Waitress was unable to explain the different types of meals ( we were with different people who had not dined there, and they were there on our recommendation). Nor able to explain a dessert listed.

Meals for the five people were served as 1 meal, then 10 minutes later 2 more meals, then 5 minutes later another meal, and finally another 5 minutes for the final meal to arrive.  We have NEVER been served in such a manner (and we are being kind about the time difference).

The piece de resistance is that people who arrived after us were being served their food even though they ordered after us!!

While there is no complaint about the taste of the food (though perhaps the portions seemed a bit smaller than previous visit), the poor service has made it unlikely that we will recommend again."}
{"text":"This place reminds me so much of all the Hungarian Places that used to be along Bloor in the Annex--the strange decor, the menu with the liquor listed at the end, the staff and the way the place fills up at a drop of a hat. Save for Country Style, they are all gone now. Fortunately Euorpe is here.

Took the kids here last time. They loved it. Appetizer Debriziners, Langos, the cucumber salad, paprikas, schnitzel, the noodles. All simple, good stuff. The only thing that was disappointing was the Dobos Torte. Go to a bakery for that, I guess."}
{"text":"Massive amounts of food for a decent price, but you have to like Hungarian food. The decor isn't spectacular, but the staff are reasonably kind and the food arrived quickly."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout the other day and loved it. Depending on how hungry you are, one schnitzel dinner might be enough for two people. Portions are generous. Personally I thought the chicken schnitzel was more moist and slightly tastier than the super-thin veal schnitzel, but both were great. (Tip: ask for extra lemon wedges.) Whichever way you go, you must get the little dumplings with gravy on the side. So delicious. And for my tastes, the acidic cucumber salad balanced the meal perfectly. That's some traditional Eastern European goodness right there."}
{"text":"For those who miss Paprika (which closed a year or so ago), this is a really good alternative! And it's close to where Paprika used to be.

Despite not being sure how to manage eating it (broken elbow has left me navigating the world one handed), I have been Craving Chicken schnitzel since I saw a picture of one on Yelp. With time to spare and being in the area, I had to give into my craving (ok, didn't have to but really wanted to). This place offers take out as well as dine in options and have a varied menu.

I ordered their schnitzel and dumplings and it was divine! Chicken was moist and the coating had a nice crunch to it. The dumplings and gravy were soft and not overly salty, the accompanying gravy allowed you to determine how saucy the dumplings/chicken would be. They were fast and although it was slightly more expensive than I was expecting, IMHO it was worth every penny.

It was quiet when I was there but I can imagine it can get quite busy and loud during the lunch/dinner hours.

Authentic European cuisine and I would say it's a must try! They've definitely gained a customer! Look forward to future meal at Europe!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here yesterday because we wanted to try something new and different. Someone had suggested we try Hungarian food, and we were up in North York so google and BlogTO told me that Europe Bar and Restaurant is the best Hungarian food in town. Let me just tell you.. The interior design and waitress were very nice, but the food was very veryyyyy bland and mediocre! My boyfriend got the chicken wiener schnitzel and I got the chicken cordon bleu with a side of Hungarian dumplings. Everything  was very bland and tasteless. It was basically the same thing as eating fried chicken, but KFC and Popeyes are muchhh better (never thought I would say that lol). I feel bad saying this as the lady serving us was really nice, but I definitely don't recommend going here. Hopefully not all Hungarian food tastes like this!"}
{"text":"Just had a birthday gathering here.  It was recommended by a friend.  Restaurant was busy. Food was great.  We ordered Goulash, wooden platters for 4 which include cabbage rolls, pork chop, chicken, sausage.  Food was delicious there I must say, but service was underwhelmed. Server spilled Goulash all over & after that, service didn't seem to be improved. I understand restaurant was busy, but she could definitely be more aware of your surroundings and improve overall service in restaurant."}
{"text":"Having a Hungarian in-law, let me tell you, I've been here a few times. It's a favourite place of my Grandfather-in-law (is that a thing??) so we end up here most nights we have dinner with them. 

Europe is a wonderful place. They have great old world charm, wonderful and attentive staff, many of which know my mother-in-law by name, and an expansive menu. The price is also right! 

This place is by no means fancy, but if you're craving Hungarian schnitzel, those delicious dumplings in gravy, or cabbage rolls, this is your place. If you're going with an appetite, definitely try one of their impressive platters! They are basically a tower of meat with a knife stabbed into it, but it's actually quite a result, AND it gives you a taste of everything. 

Why the 4 star review? I find that that sometimes the temperature of my food is inconsistent - most of the time it's perfect, but on some visits it's just kind of warm instead of hot, which for fried food is disappointing. 

Definitely worth the trip!"}
