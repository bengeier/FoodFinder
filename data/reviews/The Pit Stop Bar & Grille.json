{"text":"There with our usual group of five, and unfortunately none of us were overly impressed with the food here. From the Philly cheesesteak to the wings to the beer battered cod sandwich, there just wasn't much flavor to any of the dishes. We were particularly disappointed with the garlic wings and the cod sandwich. Probably the best thing about our meals were the fries and the \"lug nuts\" (tater tots), if that tells you anything. I will admit that the Reuben quesadilla was interesting, and probably the best thing our group ordered that wasn't a side dish. But overall, it was just \"eh.\""}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place but the food and drinks were a disappointment. There was an issue with both their soda and ice which left a bad taste. We tried Pit Stop wings since we were told they were a spicy BBQ. They were not spicy and looked like semen. Some of the wings were still pink. Also tried the onion rings. The onion part was tender and the outer breeding crispy but the inside of the breeding was raw. Settled for a bottle of beer and the check. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"First time here. Nice presentation of food. Ordered the Pit stop burger with lug nuts (tater tots). Cooked as ordered. Tasted great and the service was good! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We wanted to do trivia in a central location, so I checked out where my favorite trivia company is on Wednesdays (Cleveland Awesome Trivia- check them out!). I didn't notice that they weren't doing trivia due the Cavs game. Duh. WE found out when we got there, but were hungry so decided to stay.  My friends arrived before us- around 6:30. They ordered jalapeno poppers and 6 mild chicken wings almost right away. These appetizers didn't arrive until we showed up at almost 7:15. At that time, they ordered their entrees, 2 Buffalo chicken salads. A few moments later, we ordered our food- 24 Spicy Ranch wings, 6 mild wings and the Pit Stop Burger with a side salad.  The food took at least 45 minutes. It was not busy in the establishment. I'm not sure if they were short-handed, but it was really terrible.  Aside from the ridiculously long wait for food, there were multiple issues with the meals. My friend ordered mild wings, but he said they were so hot they were burning his lip. The waitress seemed confused and said they don't have mild, only Buffalo, although the menu clearly says mild. When my mild wings arrived, they were in fact mild.  Both chicken salads were served with under-cooked sliced chicken breast. How it was under-cooked after waiting 45 minutes, I can't even guess. The salads were presented nice, but it was just shredded iceberg lettuce. Nothing impressive. My boyfriend ordered Spicy Ranch wings and the wings tasted like they were just smothered in ranch dressing and mild buffalo sauce. There was no spice whatsoever.  I will say that my Pit Stop burger and my mild wings were very good. Burger was cooked properly. Everything was tasty. The burger had Italian Dressing, salami and ham on it- nice and zesty!  However, we spent way too much time in that bar and won't be back again. Dress code is drastically casual- some drunk at the bar was wearing slippers."}
