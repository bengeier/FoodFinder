{"text":"Put on the Brakes! After years of patronage to Singapore Sam aka Pearl Garden we're going to stop going.The first thing was after a dim sum outing both myself and my partner in crime had lip swelling... we're not allergic to any foods. We didn't get stomach sick but the last straw was when we reserved a peking duck for NYE. But when we got there, we were presented with a pathetic burnt bird. We asked for another one and they said it was the last one so we said we'd like a discount as we reserved it for special occasion. The guy could not care less. He told us to speak to the boss. The hostess/ owner always recognizes us as regular dim summers and always speaks to us so we thought she could squeeze out a small discount. She looked at us like she's never seen us before and said she can't do anything about it. Seeing as no one else would be open, we reluctantly took the bird as we did not want to show up empty handed. Shame on you Pearl Garden for treating loyal regular diners in this poor fashion. We'll  more than likely check ou the  new NE places for dim sum.  Either way we're not coming back!"}
{"text":"I live in the NE and when I want Dim Sum this is where I go. I like their dim sum a lot. Great price for average dim sum.    What I mean by average is they have all your basics dim sum requests.  They have all the dumplings,  shrimp, pork, tripes, rice dishes, rice rolls, fried, steamed, deep fried etc and desserts   I like their mango jelly as it is shaped like Fish :)   Most dishes come in 4's - they have a scallop and shrimp dumpling steamed - comes in 3   These are the few that I usually eat and I think Pearl Garden does the job right.  If you have a fix for dim sum it's just down the road  DIM SUM served everyday till 3pm    Siu Mai - Steamed Pork Dumpling  Har Gaw Steamed Shrimp dumpling  Deep fried Shirmp dumplings with mayo  Donut rice roll  Black Pepper ribs  BBQ pork pies   etc.."}
{"text":"This place used to be Singapore Sams. Since then it has changed hands several times. I decided to give this place a fair try, not really expecting much. Don't knock it until you try it, right?  They have a day time buffet, that runs along side dim sum service. We request dim sum, and we get seated. Then for a long time afterwards we weren't served at all. The 3 waitresses serving the total of 7 tables (5 of which were doing buffet) were stupendously busy. I wish I knew how to look at busy at my day job. Then people would think I'm actually working all the time.  When we finally did get served, our food took nearly half hour to arrive. All of it was lukewarm. Most of it was unsalted. And the soy sauce was bland/diluted. Upon going to the washroom, I passed by the buffet and realized many of our items were at the buffet. So then...why did our food take half an hour? The menu also has a few items that are translated wrong. We got a few things that we didn't intend to order. Overall, the meal was $60 with tip between 3 people.  I don't think I'll be coming here again."}
