{"text":"Best Mexican food in town!!! Been coming here for years! (Over 20) wonderful service and family owned.  I recommend coming in for some lunch and sitting down in Joseph's section in the sports bar area. Fast friendly and personable. This staff does it all right!!!!!"}
{"text":"Manuel's is ok, if I can't make it to my other Mexican place.It is hit and miss with them, although I do like there salsa even more than my Favorite place.Overall the food here is just ok. The meat is like most of the bertoes around here; soggy and chewy most of the time.I've yet to find a Mexican restaurant that knows how to cook meat that is tender well- seasoned and delicious.I guess for that I'd have to go somewhere super expensive, a place that uses good cuts of meat."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Manuels. There is one vloser to my house but I drive twice as far to go here. Margaritas are great the food portions are generous  ( splitting a dish is a good idea ) and the staff are all very friendly."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever written an online review. I want to warn people about this place. We went to Manuel's on a Sunday evening. We were seated at a booth. There were four plates at the table. One of plates had black grease or something all over the side. The server took the dirty plate away.
 
 Next, I look at my purse and the side was wet. Went to feel what it was and there was food or drink all over the wall. It got all over my hand. I told my family I'd be back and I left to wash my hands. My husband said he shined his phone light on the area and he saw it was some type of drink all over the booth. 

When I came back from the bathroom they had moved to another booth. The busboy brought chips and salsa. My son started to eat the chips and there was a black plastic thing in there. My husband pulls it out and it was a plastic cigarette filter! I am serious, this really happened. My husband complained to the manager and he said he would get our meal. Needless to say there was no way we were going to eat there."}
{"text":"Service was horrible!! We had no opportunity to tell the server how disappointed we were with our food because he never came back to check on us. We had to wave down the busser to ask him to take our full plates away and to ask if he could find our check. We just wanted to pay our bill and go. Will never return."}
{"text":"We are the 1st customers at the new re-modeled bar and it is amazing!  WOW!  New tvs, new bar new everything. It's awesome!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of people like this but It just seems like regular Mexican food to me.  I have tried several things and nothing has been anything but okay."}
{"text":"I always go for Happy Hour...then again every hour is every hour ...lol seriously though they have one of the best carne asada in the Valley. Juicy, tender, and not fatty at all. And ive had my share of carne asada. I am mexican. You will not be disappointed. Street tacos which are mini tacos. You get 4 for only $4!! at happy hour time...Margaritas are decent..Carnitas are amazing as well. Best place for tacos for me. 

**Update- I continue to come here. Never disappoints. I noticed prices went down on a few items. Like there carna asada plate. use to be $17! Now its $12 i believe and you get more food with it. Thats a huge plus. Was just there a couple days ago. Margaritas are always tasty. On the rocks please! Love Manuel's!"}
{"text":"Every Christmas I order a party tray, as I did thisyear. I went to pick up my order on Christmas eve and had to wait almost 40 minutes to get my order. On top of that, 2 other people had come and gone and received their orders in a timely manner. When I asked Daniela to check on my order she was VERY rude. Also, I did not receive everything I ordered. It is sad, because I love the food, but we will never go back to that location."}
{"text":"A-OK, but on the expensive side.  I did get the 8.99 nachos with shredded beef and they were awesome!  Huge.  Should not have polished off the entire plate, but couldn't help mystelf!  Better as an appetizer for 2 or more.
Was talking to a fellow customer next to me and he agreed that they are expensive and other Mexican restaurants are just as good and cheaper."}
{"text":"I only come here for Happy Hour...Then again every hour is happy hour..lol Seriously thought they have the BEST carne asada around in the valley. And ive had my share of carne asada...I am mexican. Street tacos which are mini tacos...Only $4 during happy hour...Carnitas are amazing as well. Margaritas are decent but even for Happy Hour $5 is kinda high...Service is great. Last time they failed to send a waiter or waitress to me...I complained and the manager apologized and gave me %50 off. Was not expecting that but i'll take it!"}
{"text":"I love Manuel's!! My family and I have been coming here for years. I've now turned my boyfriend onto them too! We always go on a Monday or Tuesday when they have the beef taco and cheese enchilada on special for $6.99 and the house margaritas are only $4.00. The food is consistently good and so is the service."}
{"text":"This place is ok. The food is decent besides the overpriced fajitas that had overcooked meat. The main issue is the terrible service. They argue with you on where you sit and had to ask my waitress to stop grabbing with the hostess to do her job. I am currently trying it again and the waitress is exceptionally impatient and seems to not want to be here at all. The only good experience has been the first time we came here and the manager was fantastic and so was the server. How that has seemed to change. The night crew here is terrible."}
{"text":"4 adults going out on a Saturday evening with the intent of having margaritas & dinner (around 6pm). We sat at a table in the bar area & were rudely scolded by the manager telling us we cannot sit there because those seats were on the waiting list. We put our name on the waiting list & after 20 mins we were seated in the bar area at the same table we previously had been told to leave. We ordered tea & water at this point & waited about 15 mins more before our food order was taken. After 45 minutes our waitress came back to re-take our order because it was never put in. Another 20 minutes went by and our order came out. Half of it was wrong. We sent back what was wrong to get it corrected, the dishes this time came back quickly. We ate our meal and when the check finally came we had been over-charged for the incorrect meals that were ordered. By the time we finally got the bill corrected & paid it was past 9pm and we were more than ready to just call it a night. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"The first time we tried this place, we had takeout ordered via Grubhub. It was delicious. I was sick with a nasty cold, and the chicken tortilla soup I ordered  saved the day. My husband had the Pollo Especial, which is basically a chimichanga filled with delicious chicken and a bunch of other goodies. Enchanted by the memory of that delightful experience, we decided to head back and dine in.

Both our server and the manager in charge, who happened to be standing nearby while we were ordering drinks, seemed to be confused by the prices of the beer when we asked. After consulting with the manager, he informed us that the beers were half off, since it was happy hour. We expressed our delight at this piece of information, until the still-nearby manager stepped in and corrected our server by informing everyone present that happy hour ended 15 minutes ago, and that we would be charged the usual price. Hubby decided to stick with the beer, and I ordered an iced tea. 

Chips and salsa were average. The first bowl of chips we got were pretty crushed up. My iced tea was weak and tasted like it hasn't been brewed to full strength. Drinks ran pretty low until we flagged our server down to request refills, and when he returned, he only filled up our glasses about halfway. We were seated next to one of the computer stations, and witnessed several servers pushing each other playfully and cursing at each other in front of customers. The last straw was overhearing 2 servers having a very loud and inappropriate personal conversation right next to us, as though we weren't even sitting there. 

I ordered the #4 combination, which is a taco, red chile enchilada, and refried beans. I thought the price of  $10.95 was a bit steep for what I got. The taco was delicious, packed with flavorful shredded beef, and the shell was fried to crisp perfection, but the single, small enchilada was lacking in flavor and heat. 

Overall, they get three stars from me for our previous takeout order, and for the decent food during our visit. But the service was mediocre, and I wasn't impressed with the lack of professionalism that was displayed during our visit. I probably won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Fast service, good salsa, great food, family owned. Can be a bit pricy, fed 3 people for $43 including tip so not unreasonable."}
{"text":"Manuel's is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix!  I am part Hispanic so I know good Mexican food.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the hard-shell shredded beef tacos and refried beans!  YUM.  We always request Wallace to serve us because he is so nice, thorough and never messes up.  He also checks on us to see how we are doing throughout our meal.  The chips here are so thin, hit and good!  The salsa is great.  I wish they'd add tres leches cake to their dessert menu though!"}
{"text":"Why this place doesnt have five stars is a mystery to me.amazing food.great drinks.beautiful restaurant. I had the carne tampiquena and it was flavorful.the marinade made the steak tender i could cut it with my fork.my wife had the 3 amigos plate it was awesome.we drove from peoria just enjoy this great food."}
{"text":"Very good service, family restaraunt so if you want quiet ask to sit away from the family's like we did.  Had pitron margaritas for $9.25.  Good but not as good as Jimmy Buffets Margaritaville.  Shared the enchilada trio and the street tacos.  All very good.  Unlimited nacho chips with two types of salsa.  Also very good and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Hands down this is our go to Mexican restaurant in North Phoenix.  I highly recommend getting the \"Fiesta Platter\" which is a combo of all sorts of great stuff.  Chips and salsa are great, and they usually have some sort of drink special like $2.50 Corona's all summer long.  Whether you want to eat in the restaurant, or have some drinks with friends in the Cantina, it's a great atmosphere.  Staff is always friendly, and when something isn't right, they do go out of their way to make it right, from lower staff to management.  All around fantastic place that will remain in business for many years due to their quality and friendliness."}
{"text":"I've been to all locations and all food and customer service was consistent except this one, I order the same entree at places. This food was greasy and over cooked. Server dropped plates and never to be seen again until time to drp off check. I guess he assumed he wasn't going to get tipped well so he didn't want to check back. I won't go back to this location"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first visit for the most part. Food was good, but service was mediocre at best. Started pretty strong and then really tanked. Had to find a different server to help settle our bill."}
{"text":"My absolute FAVORITE place for Mexican food!!!  We eat here so much I feel like family =)  My daughter always orders the Beef Taquitos and usually can't finish them.  My favorite is the #6-Chilequiles, a Mexican cassarole made with layers of tortilla chips, pulled chicken, green chiles, onions, green sauce and sour cream......making you drool yet???  It SO DANG GOOD!!!  Its inexpensive and filling...my daughter and I share and barely can finish.  Chips and salsa are fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"This was our first time here in many many years and after some recommendations we ventured away from our favorite Mexican food restaurant and gave it a try.  Here it goes:
The service was perfect.  I'm sorry I don't recall his name but our food was timely, hot and correct. Our drinks were always full and empty ones removed.  
I had the shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada with beans.  Hands down one of the best tacos. 
My husband had the red chili burrito combo and was happy with his order as well. 
The kids had French fries.... don't ask."}
{"text":"I have been going to manuels for 5 years now.  The atmosphere is great.  I recommend the green chili chimichanga.  Everything that I have tried there has been wonderful."}
{"text":"The worst Mexican restaurant I have ever eaten at yet.  The food taste was very disappointing, bland and cold. I would never recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"On Sept 16th, we decided to try a new Mexican restaurant. This was our first time here and I gotta say we choose a good one....reasonable prices, friendly service,  good food, with large portions. The margaritas were awesome, made by James & Sean. Thanks guys for a fun dining experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best Mexican food in all of Arizona! The staff is awesome, the food is delicious and the atmosphere has a great vibe! I highly highly recommend eating there. The spinach dip is next level too"}
{"text":"I always love coming here! The food is always amazing and the drinks are great. We had great service tonight from all the staff! I had tacos tonight which have never disappointed me! And of course dessert which is on another level, that apple pie sizzling dessert is nuts!!!"}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch hour weary of whether I would be able to get in and out in time to get back to work. I let the server know of my intentions and he promised he could make it happen. Tortilla chips were hot and fresh. I kept it simple with a bean and cheese burrito but it definitely hit the spot. The staff was friendly and quick. As I was leaving, I noticed the patio area was neatly decorated and looked like a nice place to come one weekend night to enjoy a margarita. I would definitely recommend for a casual dinner location!"}
{"text":"OOPS! Sorry to say, I was disappointed on almost everything food. The salsa was some sweet tomato like paste. The hot salsa was even sweeter. I had a Machaca dinner of course. The Machaca was sweet. What part of Mexico is the cook from? Have you ever seen a movie where the guy is on a raft in the middle of the ocean? He keeps drinking seawater to cure his thirst but he dies? Well that is what my dinner was like. I kept pouring on the salsa but it didn't taste any better. I poured it on the bland beans, I poured it on the bland rice. But to no avail. It just kept getting sweeter. $25.00 for dinner. Great setting though. Nice waitress. Won't go back till the cook goes to Mexico."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a delicious Mexican meal! A ton of options and the margaritas were tasty too!  Wait wasn't long and the staff was friendly and always asked if we needed anything.   I'll surely be a return customer!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant with my dad since I was a little girl. This place has a special place in my heart for that reason. Their food is so delicious and service is always great. Will keep coming back forever!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 5 years I really like it and I plan to keep coming here. They do get quite busy on most days  but I like going in the mornings for the breakfast especially Sunday. I have never been let down and the service rocks!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for a relaxed Saturday breakfast.  Staff is friendly and the food is great.  My family and I go here at least twice a month.  They have breakfast burritos, omelette and pancakes/ French toast.  My granddaughter gets the pancakes, sunny side eggs and bacon.  Special shoutout to Danny and Lori they are such great staff."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! The green corn tamales are the best I have ever had, the salsa is authentic and bursting with flavor, and the staff interact like family. Very warm and friendly atmosphere. Great place to get your margarita on ;)"}
{"text":"Oh sh***#!! --It's Christmas Eve at 7:27pm and my brother and I still haven't decided where we're going out for dinner... We've been debating what kind of food, how fancy etc for 45 minutes. I'm picky and have diet restrictions. He loves meat which I don't so much. The kids are just flat out hungry! He's local and I'm not, so finally I just ask him to pick a good Mexican food restaurant. He calls Manuel's and they tell him they're only seating till 8pm. Let's go!

We arrive at 7:50 and the hostess immediately says \"we're not seating anymore.\" I reply that we just called and were told they seat till 8, and that's why we came. After she goes in back, our party of 5 was seated --5 minutes after we arrived. 

The food was not bad, but it was a bit expensive for what we got. I had vegetable fajitas with shrimp added which put mine around $15. The fajitas were good and came with whole pintos which had great flavor but were a bit crunchy. The regular salsa was sweet, and the hot was all pepper. Wallace gets them three stars: he was professional and patient (\"up to a point\" as he told me). When we arrived every seat except ours was full. When we finished at 8:45, we were the only ones there. Before Wallace brought the check he even asked if I wanted another beer or if we wanted dessert! That's saying a lot on Christmas Eve. I'd definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"Very good food, unlike most of the Mexican food in the area.  Tastes like someone took the time to cook.  Clean restrooms as well."}
{"text":"Don't recommend this place at all! Not authentic Mexican food for starters. The best thing we had was probably the complementary salsa and chips and the guacamole dip appetizer which was a good amount for the price ($5). Our waiter was nice, our sodas were never dry and she checked on us frequently. My boyfriend got the Baja fish taco platter which I definitely do not recommend. The fish is not fried like it's suppose to be, instead it's made in a stew like sauce with no flavor. Tartar sauce tastes like the buttermilk from jack in the box. I ordered the carnitas plate that comes with rice and beans. The carnitas could have been cooked more but the rice and beans were good. Overall we will not be returning to Manuel's."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. The food was great! The owner took time to come over and chat with me to welcome me. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Nice decor friendly service.  Tamale was very good.   Fried icecream was excellent. So good.   Ive has a lot worse mexican and alot better.  But all in all not bad.  Reasonably priced.  I would go back"}
{"text":"I must admit I LOVE Manuel's! The food is always excellent and the service is just as good. I really like the Happy Hour here, I promise, you can't go wrong with the House Margarita or the Sangria and those cheap Taquitos! Yummerz!!! The beef enchiladas are moist and delicious. Last time I was here my sister even ordered the Sopaipillas and I almost went to fat heaven! For those of you who don't know; Sopaipillas are these little soft pillow donuts sprinkled with powdered sugar and can be dipped in or drizzled with a honey syrup. To die for and if you eat enough you most certainly will die of diabetes or some other fat related disease. Don't fill up on the warm chips and salsas because you'll still want to stuff yourself even when the food comes out. I'm here at least once a month to meet up with my cousin and I look forward to a good experience every time!"}
{"text":"Definitely a family favorite! They have the best hot sauce, salsa and chips. Their shredded beef is so flavorful! Always friendly and great service! They even have Dos Equis Amber on draft."}
{"text":"So glad we finally found a Mexican restaurant we love.   Service has been great every time we visit.   Margaritas are yummy.   Love the tacos, enchiladas, tostadas and fajitas.   Rice and beans are just the way my family likes them.   You know you are going to a good restaurant when there's always a little wait for dinner ... not bad though.  Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we will be back for sure.  We loved the food and the service was great. Best salsa ever!"}
{"text":"I was here for my birthday. Overall, the food was good. I got the burro with enchilada. I requested a wet green burrito and was brought a red one, but I enjoyed it anyway. The chips and salsa were good. There is hotter salsa available upon request. They sang Happy birthday and brought me a delicious, complimentary fried ice cream."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE THIS PLACE!! everytime my boyfriend and i come here the waitresses, bartenders and the owner always greet us and make us feel welcomed. The food, OMG! THE CHEESE CRISP IS AAAAAAAMAZING! The drinks are also very good! Went there with my boyfriends family and service was also very good! I do wish this place had a little more authentic Mexican dishes. Like pozole? 

All in all, this place is great!

Btw, bartender Rick IS AWESOME!!!! AND SEAN TOO!

Chris the guy that works at the cantina side is very rude. Maybe a little pep talk would do him some good."}
{"text":"Arrived at 130pm for lunch. Seated ourselves on the patio as usual. We frequent this location. But not anymore. It's 212pm and and we have received chips and salsa, and a menu but no service. No order even after my wife went in and asked for the server. Seems the place is back to the ridiculously bad service we have had some years ago!
Good luck."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are really good and the fish tacos are amazing!! I only have it four stars because one night we went and it smelled like something was burning in the kitchen and it was quite unpleasant, but every other time has been great!"}
{"text":"I sat in the bar but ordered from the regular menu. The service was good but the food only so-so. I ordered a quesadilla which was awful. Very thick and almost doughy. I also ordered a mini-chimichanga plate. The chicken was dry and the bean chimis were not so crisp on the outside. 

It's okay for happy hour, but stick to the chips & salsa."}
{"text":"Not bad for chain-restaurant type Mexican.  Portions are big.  Service was good.  I'd come back"}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the first time and let me tell you, the food is just as great as the service. Friendly staff with tasty food!!! Highly recommend getting the chimichanga or the burrito!!! Try the norteño style burrito!!! DELICIOUS!!! The chips and salsa are also very tasty!!! Don't let me forget about Margarita Mondays!!! Must try!!!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Mexican food restaurant since I was little. recently moved away from here but came back to have the best Mexican food ever"}
{"text":"Moved to Phoenix from the Midwest and was hoping to try some authentic Mexican food. This place was awful. I was so disappointed.. only thing I liked was the salsa."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a restaurant with a more cultural ambiance, this would be the place. The restaurant is adorned with traditional Mexican paintings, a fountain, and floral decoration all throughout. I was pleased to know they have a hot salsa to accompany your chips in addition to a regular salsa- most restaurants don't have this option, certainly not free either like Manuel's does. I tried their Pollo Especial and the meat was very tender. Their service is also quite speedy for the amount of customers they had this evenings, they have a lot of employees working at all times. Overall, I did not give this restaurant five stars because the beans and rice were satisfactory at best and these two things usually accompany every meal on the menu."}
{"text":"Our waiter Gino was wonderful. The salsa was the best I've ever had and the patio seething was just lovely. If you can, go here!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch and the food and service were acceptable, but not worth going back."}
{"text":"I had a great meal at Manuel's!  I ordered their three amigos enchiladas.  This was a great way to try three different enchiladas.  My friends and I went their after and event.  We ate, drank and hung out for hours (while drinking).  The staff was very welcoming and friendly!  Would go back here in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I had the pollo especial with yummy jalapeño cream sauce, and it was perfect. Jerry served 12 of us on a very busy night with a great attitude and excellent service and even put up with my nieces teasing without batting an eye. Good job, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Not good! Don't waste your money here is Not real Mexican food.. I order carnitas tacos and I got beef tacos and the salsa was from tostitos jar."}
{"text":"DO NOT EVER go to this restaurant, they mailed coupons for a free meal to new residents, once we got there we ordered, the coupons say one PER household, there were two of use from different households our addresses are printed on the coupons, when we get ready to leave we asked for separate bills, they refused to honor both coupons the police where called. We are senior citizens on fixed incomes if I had known they were not going to honor the coupons I would NEVER have gone since I did not have money to pay for it, my friend had to pay because the police would not back us up on the fact that they are falsely advertising."}
{"text":"I am now officially full, and five pounds heavier than when I entered Manuel's!
On this visit we received very polite and fast service from two different waiters. More than polite, they were friendly. 
I tried out the Rolled chicken quesadillas, which were well more than I could & should eat--I saved part for later. 
I was hoping for tres leches as dessert but unfortunately they do not serve that. Feeling an urge for something sweet I opted for Apple pie with ice cream which surprisingly came out on a boiling platter. The caramelized sugar added a nice flavor to the dish. To my figure's regret, I finished it alone. Couldn't waste a bit!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places for Mexican food. It's authentic, fresh and they pour a great margarita! I suggest picking a specialty margarita on the menu!
Happy hour is great- drink specials and a few apps for $6 each. Never had a bad experience here, there are always hands on deck and I've never had an issue with food or service out of the dozens of times I have dined. I love the fiesta platter- it's literally 1 of everything, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Manuels! This place has the BEST salsa and great food. We have been going here for the last 35 years. Either the Bell road location or the one on Peoria have owners that truly care about the food, service, and their customers.  I suggest the \"pollo especial\" with extra jalapeño cream cheese. They cater too!!!"}
{"text":"=====================  REVISITED 12/12/13 =====================

Came here last night after our weekly Thursday night meeting with two other people and my wife. It's obviously a popular place, it was quite busy. 

I've eaten in countless Mexican restaurants . Arizona definitely has some of the best Mexican food and Manuel's is one of the best. Everything people ordered was terrific. The salsa is  freakin' awesome! The flavors, textures, and spices of this salsa are unmatched by any other. I could eat their chips and salsa all day long I'm addicted to it. The chips were fresh & hot. The best part is they brought you as many bowls of them as we wanted.
.
PORTIONS: Are plentiful. You won't leave here hungry that's for sure.

FOOD: OMG the food is so fabulous this has become my favorite place to eat Mexican food. My experiences with Manuel's are simply top notch and it is for this reason when I crave Mexican food  it has grown to become one of my favorite places to eat. The food is always hot, fresh, and tasty. SERVICE:Always great service.  Staff here is always upbeat pleasant, attentive , friendly &  professional.
 PRICE: The price IS very reasonable. AMBIANCE: Nicely decorated. Family friendly & great for dinner with friends or business associated. CONCLUSION:  RETURN FACTOR 50-50....%. 
  
    ******************* What does my OVERALL rating mean? ********************

5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! 
4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. 
3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. 
2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. 
1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH"}
{"text":"The price is right and the food is good. The cheese crisp is my favorite and when it's made perfect it is the best! Every once in awhile the cheese crisp won't be as good as it can be, but I forgive them because everything else is always good."}
{"text":"I've always come here during lunch & can't seem to deviate from the al-la-carte beef taco & sharing an extra crispy quesadilla... what can I say? I like it *that* much* My friends have had more the variety, we all greatly like the food. Chips & salsa are pretty yummers!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Always get fast friendly service! If we go for date night or take the whole family everyone always get something good to eat."}
{"text":"Good food and I love the fried ice cream"}
{"text":"The food is great. Get the shredded pork nachos. The service is always on point. The medium salsa is good, the hot is hotter than the fires of Mordor."}
{"text":"A family-owned restaurant that has managed  to expand throughout the Valley over the last 46 years is impressive, but what's more impressive is the fact that what they serve and how the serve it is what has made Manuel's last this long.  

My family has been eating at Manuel's for many years, and we've never had a bad experience.  The staff is always very friendly -- like family, almost -- and the food is dependably good. You can't go wrong with their menu, and the prices are just right.  They've also got a great lunch menu, with even better prices, and some great drink deals.  

So, if you're looking for a family-friendly, good meal at a good price, definitely give Manuel's a try."}
{"text":"The pollo especial may be the absolute worst Mexican dish that I have tasted, ever.  The fajitas are the only thing worth eating at this place, everything else I have tried has been extra salty and bland."}
{"text":"I haven't been this impressed with a restaurant in a VERY long time. I had a craving for nachos and hadn't eaten here in years. We came for dinner and from the second we sat down absolute amazement. We were served drinks right away (that still haven't gone empty because our waiter is on point.) within seconds chips and salsa were delivered. (Again, never went empty.) Food was out in minutes. And our waiter Merciado (I think that's spelled right) was super polite and amazing. This place won't disappoint. I'm happy and full. Will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"It's shame that this place does not honor the memory of the original founding parents. The food wasn't great and the fried ice cream was not made fresh. The cornflakes were soggy, chewy not being ground up, and the honey didn't run down the ice cream like it would if it were made fresh. Do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"The food was great; first bowl of chips were stale but the second was fresh so I was wondering. My boyfriend & I shared some chicken fajitas and they were delicious. Our waitress was nice however was a little slow on drink refills... Took us 20 min after we were finished eating that she finally brought the tab. The people at the front weren't very friendly she never greeted us all she said was \"give me a few mins to seat you\" lol very weird. I only gave 3 stars because the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"I have been here many times. Normally, the food is great and service is decent. Was seated quickly, even having a party of eleven. Unfortunately,  it took out food over 55 minutes to arrive even after talking to the manager. We watched 2 other smaller groups of people arrive after us, eat and leave before we were served. The managers reasoning \"you were behind a large party of 30 in the casita.\" Technically,  weren't the people seated after us then after a party of eleven?"}
{"text":"I love Manuel's. 

I know that every time I got to Manuel's I'm going to have a good experience. 

I think they have the best cheese enchiladas. Hands down. 

Their chimichangas are so good too. 

I like how they have several locations throughout the Valley and the food is always consistant. 

I've always had great service at Manuel's. The prices are reasonable too. 

I've been a customer for years and that won't be changing anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. The food was good. The salsa was too sweet, had to ask the for chulpa. The menus were not wiped off. Kinda gross. Very busy place on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Had the Fiesta Platter. Very good. Definitely recommend coming here and waiter was awesome and just attentive enough."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices. Took a family member from out of town based on reviews, I had the taco salad and my husband had the enchiladas both were great. Service was good."}
{"text":"Love Manuel's my favorite. Food is amazing and the environment is awesome. Brandon our server tonight was AWESOMESAUCE!!!!!!!. Thankyou"}
{"text":"Just relocated here from Florida with my family & we were in need of some Mexican food even though our fitness trainers would strongly disagree, lol!! Well after reading Manuel's history we figured that this may be the real deal even though they've grown into a chain & we were thankfully pleasantly surprised. Despite reading some negative short stories on this restaurant by people who can't even show their face, those are normally the first reviews we always disregard, come on people you're afraid the next cook may spit in your food, lol!! Besides that we got a great server, Cindy who was very attentive & had some great suggestions, we ended up starting with the Patron margarita on the rocks, yes it hit the spot. We also had the complimentary chips & salsa, the salsa was beyond perfect, not too puréed but also not too chunky. My hubby had the steak fajitas & he said they were delish, he used all of the flour tortillas which is something he normally doesn't do!! I went with the taco salad with chicken & OMG it was so frickin good the shell had such a perfect crunch to it & the chicken had huge chunks of chicken breast!! Yes I ate about the whole damn thing & I will tell no one but you my fellow yelpers because I so cheated & this will not be logged into my fitness pal, lol!! As far as ambience & us being from Miami, yes we were way overdressed, this is your definite super casual spot but then again we are slowly learning that Phoenix overall is a pretty laid back place which is a okay with us, just some readjusting is all we've got to do!! Would we go back, yes definitely & we'd ask for Cindy without a doubt."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!!! If I wanted reheated food I would have got a TV dinner for cheaper. My beans were burnt around the edges and you couldn't pick up the bowl it was so hot. Also our \"waiter\" waited on us twice to take our order and get payment. We waited 15min for him just to bring the check."}
{"text":"I was actually really impressed today. The chips were nice and crispy. The cheese enchilada was AMAZING. I know what you're thinking. How can you mess up a cheese enchilada? Well, having had some pretty mediocre ones lately, this one really stands out. The sauce was nice and tangy and the cheese was ooey gooey melted perfection. Had a pretty decent margarita too. I sat at the bar during lunch and the service was great and fast. Now, why is it whenever they say the plate is really hot, the first thing I do is grab it? Muy caliente! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not being a big fan of chain restaurants, I wasnt super excited to eat here last night. I was however, starving and craving mexican food and wanting to try somewhere new so we ended up at Manuel's. 

OMG I loved it! The salsa's (especially the hot!) the chips, the cheese crisp with green chiles and onions, and most of all: the chilaquiles!! I LOVE chilaquiles so much and had mostly seen them only served at breakfast until I opened up Manuel's menu and there they were, just how I like them! SO good I wouldve licked the dish they were served in if I wasnt so full afterwards!

JD had a rolled quesadilla that was fantastic too and we both needed to be rolled out of there when we finished eating. It was so good though that I'm craving it again today. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome every time we are on the side of town we always have to stop here and eat. very friendly Great customer service . if you don't stop to eat here you are missing out !"}
{"text":"this place tasted like a place non mexicans go to eat mexican food. i had a combo platter with a taco, enchilada, rice and benas. the food was ok but not worth going again.  service was very good and the restaurant has a nice vibe!"}
{"text":"I typically go to another location located on cave creek and cactus when I need my Manuel's fix but we happened to be closer to this location so I brought my out of town visitors here. We were immediately thrown off at the lack of friendly service. They were clearly busy and I understand that can make a server and support staff a tad bit short tempered but we were seated and our server showed up without even a hello or any sort of greeting, just a \"what do you want to drink?\". Luckily, the food always is consistent and really tasty which saved the experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely our fave place to go for Mexican food. Out of all the mexican restaurants we have eaten at, their salsa is THE BEST (love the hot and the mild). We have eaten there 30+ times and have only had bad service a few times. Cant go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We had a retirement luncheon planned and the order was for the wrong day.  Now this was at 10:30 in the morning when we realized the luncheon was today at noon.  Well I called Manuels and let Greg know that the catering order was for today, not Friday.  He found the order and said he would get the order done within the hour and deliver it too. Well the party came off without a hitch, the food was delish!!!  Greg and Manuels on 28th Street and Indian School saved the day!  Thank you so very much!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my lunch here.  Friendly staff.  Had the steak burrito - it was decent.  Very friendly bartender and staff.  Place was more of a bar that also had a kitchen than a restaurant with a bar.  I would come here for drinks with friends and likely eat somewhere else.  Food was definitely not California Mexican - meaning Manuel does not use the quality fresh healthy ingredients you get from California Mexican fusion.  This is more Mexican - refried, lots of cheese, and too many fried choices.  It all comes out looking gray and cheesy.  Three stars because the margarita was very good."}
{"text":"Back at my one of my favorite bar/restaurants and with the new renovations it's better than ever!!! The new setup and amazing TVs...WOW! And happy to have my bartender Mida back!! Love her, she makes every experience a great one!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We have been passing by for a few years and finally stopped to try it out.  The bean burro enchilada style was out of this world my husband had el pastor tacos and he love them .  The bar was nice, the bartender was friendly and very nice. We will be back"}
{"text":"Consistent service... Very friendly staff. A great place to catch a cerveza, margarita and watch a game... Or a full on meal. The enchiladas are my favorite... Chips & salsa very good... Margaritas I get with patron... That's a plus:-) pretty standard fare... Could use a bit of unique to the menu... But I still love Manuels:-)"}
{"text":"The rolled chicken quesidlia is epic good, almost too much to eat in one setting."}
{"text":"After nearly 1 year of driving by this restaurant we decided to try it out. We were presently surprised by the great quality food and affordable bill to top it off!

Was also refreshing to have such good service. Had 4 different employees ask us if we needed anything else (besides the waiter). This included chips, drinks, and utensils.

I would highly recommend this restaurant to couples or families."}
{"text":"THE best salsa I've had in a while and great, crispy chips.  Our waitress, Laurie, was attentive and food arrived hot and fast.  I had the Chicken Pibil Tacos (in honor of the Taco Festival in Scottsdale this weekend) and loved them.  A focus of Manuel's seems to be on customer service and it shows.  Great place for lunch-will be trying out the dinner menu soon."}
{"text":"Not big to complain... or bad reviews, but this place is just all types of bad, i have been here a few times, costumer service is ok (at best), the food? Well I always have issues with it... tonight I had the pleasure of ordering for pick up, ordered the Albóndigas, a Chicken Rolled Quesadilla and a Chille Relleno combination dinner, the Rolled quesadilla was ok, but the guacamole that accompanies it was black, my albondigas where raw (unfortunately i did not take a photo), I can assume it is pre-frozen since it was incredible hard to cut it open and the center was really cold, the soup (liquid) was luke warm at best... and this I just found insulting... I got all beans with my Chile relleno, they did provide a side of rice (a sauce container of it)...  when taking it back and requesting a refund(it's already closing hour) I get an attitude and push back to get my money back, aside from an albóndiga being cut open, food was taken back intact, I got offered the opportunity to have my food remade (as I hear everyone in the kitchen complain that I took my order back), on the positive side, I was able to get my money back."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since 1989. Very good Mexican food. I like the restaurant and the bar. Everyone is very nice. The Spinach Enchiladas are spicy! My favorite is Chicken Fajitas. They make killer Red chillies. Chunk meat not hamburger crap! In Thursday nights they make Green Chillies pulled pork that is SOOOOO good."}
{"text":"Some friends invited us out for dinner and suggested this place. They recommended the house Margarita's. Our party was for 4 and we all wanted one so we decided to get a pitcher... this wasn't a good idea as it turns out. The pitcher didn't save us any money at all which we all found strange - next time we'll just get our own glass I guess. The Margarita's were good though.

The food was good but the service was so-so...our friends said the service is usually much better and that the waitress may be new since they had never seen her before (we sat on the bar side). I won't really hold the slow service against them too much right now.

So based on my first experience I'll give them 3-Stars; however, we will go again and possibly revise to 4-Star based on the feedback from friends."}
{"text":"Went last week in the late afternoon.  Everything was wonderful, fresh and tasty.  Service was great, and I'm glad I stopped here!  Good job!"}
{"text":"Incredible all the way around. I have worked in the industry for years and I have to say, Wallace provided some of the best service I've ever received. Very personable and friendly. He made my wife and I feel right at home. 

And the food. My goodness. I had the tampiqueno dinner, my wife had the #2 combo (beef and sour cream enchilada and shredded need taco). They were perfection. My steak was a beautiful medium rare, just like I had asked for, and the chips and salsa were ON POINT!! I would highly recommend this restaurant to any lover of Mexican cuisine. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"I Love the food at Manuel's I always start off with some Great Appetizers like the Mexican Pizza and I order a side of Guacamole Dip, it's almost a meal by itself but I always save room for the Sour Cream Enchiladas and I always have there Great Margaritas. The bar is a great place to sit because they always have sports on the many large TV's

{"text":"horrible time,worse service ever at any place,the owner was there and was rude,poor host,poor waitress,never go back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here.  We have come by several times but it's always been packed, and we went elsewhere.  This time we picked a Sunday at 5:00PM, and just beat the rush.

We were greeted quickly and seated, and our server was excellent!  The chips and salsa were very good, the mild had some bite to it.  I had the Pollo Especial, which was one of the best chicken dishes I have ever eaten.  My wife had a chimi, which was also excellent.

I rated them 4 stars because it was our first visit...we will be back and am anticipating another excellent meal and an upgrade to 5.

After eating here many, many more times, I have yet to be disappointed and am working my way through the menu.  Everything is outstanding, and I have upped Manuel's to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food was great, well all but the flour tortillas, I've got copier paper thicker than these things. Awesome spinach cheese dip, highly recommended, but request regular tortilla chips with it. Service started off pretty good but then she was to busy flirting with an ex employee to tend to her tables. Wasn't extremely bad but shouldn't be happening as much as it was. Alma, the table busser, seemed to be the hardest worker and was the only one not hanging out with the former employee. Would have been 5 star had it not been for this."}
{"text":"So I started getting a cold yesterday and wanted some more soup it was late already 8pm so hunny went off on the search for soup since it was Mothers Day n' all. He ended up at Manuels dont ask me why!! Our white neighbor loves eating here, he had heard from somewhere or someone that they had the best albondiga (meatball) soup?! Well it was wayyy tooo salty other than that it was ok kinda spicey not too hot though. I don't eat meat but the kid liked the meatballs it looked like they had rice in them anh herbs too who'd a thunk. Chips were a tad too greasy and the salsa wasn't too bad good heat, beans were good rice was alright. If it is necessary and in a pinch again I'd go again but prob not."}
{"text":"Not my favorite.

I do not visit Manuels often however, a few friend of mine had a hankering for Mexican food and Manuels was the closest restaurant. When we entered the restaurant we were seated quickly and  our server immediately brought us chips, salsa, and our beverages. 

Maybe I expect too much when I go to a Mexican Restaurant but one thing I do expect is decent salsa, nothing you could buy out of a jar at a grocery 
store.  The chips were fresh however, the salsa was watery and a little spicy, it just wasn't very good. 

The menu at Manuels Mexican Restaurant is comprehensive, and offers a varied selection of entrée's.  On this visit we ordered a crispy beef taco, bean tostada, and a  taco salad.

Even though our entrée's arrived, piping hot, we all agreed the missing ingredient was a lack of flavors or taste. The food was hot and plentiful, but really had no taste. After lunch we decided to end our meal with something sweet. For dessert we  had the fried ice cream which  was delicious, the best part of the meal.

I want to end this review on a positive note by saying the service at Manuels is ourstanding.  Our server made sure our chip bowl and glasses were always full before we even asked.  Great service, generous portions, and reasonable pricing is what keeps people coming back."}
{"text":"We've become semi-regulars at Manuel's lately...usually for happy hour in the bar.  Well the bar is currently being renovated so my wife, daughter and I had dinner in the restaurant last night.  

We were greeted nicely and quickly seated.  My appetizer plate was a little dirty and when I borrowed one from another table the bus boy came by and apologized profusely.  I told him no big deal...those things happen.  Waiter was excellent...very friendly and with a good sense of humor.

Chips and salsa were very good.  Two kinds of salsa...mild and hotter.  My wife and daughter prefer the mild but I like the hot stuff.  Chips were warm and fresh.  Waiter was attentive and kept the basket filled.

Now on to the food...I had the carne asada burro norteño style.  Excellent flavor to the meat - sauce could have been a little more spicy though.  My wife had a chimi enchilada style..she liked it too.  Daughter wasn't too hungry so she just had a couple of beef tacos.  The plate was emptied so I assume that she liked it also.

All in all, a pretty decent meal."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. They have the best chips and salsa, and usually good service. I love the machaca burrito, espinaca style. Also the chicken fajitas."}
{"text":"Very good for a classic Phoenix-style Mexican restaurant. What do I mean by Phoenix-style? That it is nice, grand, with all the visual queues of an Americanized Mexican restaurant--spanish tile, bright decorations, mariachi music in the background, and a huge menu of cheesy spicy goodness and endless margaritas.

While not on par with the Tucson classics, I would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but I ordered it to go and it spilled out into the bag they gave me. When I asked for them to remake it for me, they did, but only put about 1/4 of the actual amount of food into the box. Felt like a rip off"}
{"text":"Shrimp picado awesome, dos xx on tap, yum. Eddie at the bar busting his butt for over 10 years, cool dude!"}
{"text":"Our favorite family restaurant! Food is awesome. Service is better!
We have been going here for 15 years and its always consistent. Lunch menu is great and fast!! Thank you for taking care of us"}
{"text":"We did not enjoy this restaurant.  The food was mediocre.  The melted cheese on our loaded nachos tasted like cheese whiz from a jar.  The server was polite and provided good service.  That is the only reason I gave this a 2 star instead of a 1."}
{"text":"Outstandingly service. Cheese crisp is outstanding. Beef tacos cooked well with a nicely flavored rice side dish. Do not leave without sopepeda bites for desert and share with s friend or two. Nice family atmosphere and very relaxing for lunch crowd. A place where you truly felt welcome."}
{"text":"I took my Lab for lunch on the patio.   I had asked last year shortly after the patio was completed if it was OK and was told no problem.    Well when I showed today,  I was questioned if my dog was a service dog??  I said well she is today jokingly.   I was asked for my papers.   I was told that they had not taken the time to fill out the paper work for the pet friendly patio.   but it was OK this time since I was the only one on the patio at 3pm in the afternoon.    Make up your mind.   Either do it or not.   finished 1/2 my beer and lunch and left.  Not worth the hassle.  
The food was good as usual."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Every time I go there I'm always satisfied. My favorite thing on the menu is the Polo Especial... It's a winner every time! I would have given it five stars, but the last couple times I have gone the service hasn't been spectacular. All of my servers have always been super friendly, they just haven't always been super prompt. I will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"This place really isn't worth one star but since that's the lowest option I have...

I have been here twice and really didn't enjoy the first trip.  I enjoyed tonight's visit even less.  We only came here to eat because our favorite restaurant was so packed we couldn't even find a parking spot.  I ordered a cheese crisp with chicken on it.  It took over a half hour to get our food.  We sat there and waited and waited.  Our waitress at one point said our food should be up soon and then we didn't see her for another 15 minutes.  When my food arrived it was cold.  Not wanting to wait another half hour for a replacement meal I scraped all the cold chicken (half of which looked disgusting, btw) off the cheese crisp and just ate the cold cheese/tortilla.  My mom's cheese enchilada wasn't cooked either.  The cheese wasn't even remotely melted.

Our waitress took another 15 minutes to bring our bill and asked if we needed boxes.  We said no.  Another 5 minutes went by and she came back to get the card.  By this time I was irritated.  She obviously had too many tables and couldn't keep up with her workload.  When she finally came back with our card she asked again if we wanted boxes.  I finally told her that she should tell the people in the kitchen our food had come out cold.  She apologized but after the excessive delays and the cold food, it's just not enough to make me want to eat here again.  The only good thing I can say is the chips were good."}
{"text":"The service was good.  Wanted to rate higher however the abondagas soup was not so good.  The tacos are good, the tamale was good but wouldn't have liked more masa.  The taco salad looked good but was pretty bad.  Just okay"}
{"text":"This place is cozy & casual place to have a good Street Tacos & Water Melon Margarita(it's a must try) But also ask for Peppermint Margarita thats my number #1 but it's only seasonal."}
{"text":"Love this place, always my first choice for Mexican food. This location is my favorite of all the Manuel's restaurants in the valley. Chris and the other staff in the cantina are great, we always make it a point to sit in the cantina."}
{"text":"The service here is very good. The food arrived quickly and was better than average. We treated our kids and grand kids to dinner out and this was their restaurant of choice. I recommend the Three Amigos speciality dish if you like enchiladas."}
{"text":"I come here weekly with my kids. The food is pretty good. The last two waiters that we've had have been very professional and charismatic. It's a breathe of fresh air in comparison to the service that I've had at other similar places."}
{"text":"Always a good time eating here. The service is good, the chips and salsa are great and the food is excellently consistent."}
{"text":"For what it is...meh it's okay.  Food is edible and will get you full for sure.  I'm not all into the decor - tad bit tacky, but I whatever floats your boat.  Service was lacking granted I understand lunch rushes, but seriously you don't have to ask if I need a refill 10 times when my glass is still half full - where's my tamales anyways!  I guess if you're really craving for some Mexican food it'll do the job just fine."}
{"text":"EDIT 2/4/2014 -  4 stars.  Great food.  Went back for dinner and had a wonderful meal.  Hubby got the machaca and said it was heaven on a plate.  I took a taste and was almost jealous I hadn't ordered it myself.  My plate was a mix-and-match meal with a green corn tamale and beef enchilada (see photo).  Loved it!  Our kids were happy with their kids menu selections.  One of them ordered a burger with a side of rice.  Not many places where you can do that.  Overall, a great meal and we'll be back for more.

---------------
Original review:

After many hours spent shopping for and buying a car from one of the nearby dealerships, we were all starving.  Manuel's got decent yelp reviews so we decided to stop in.  So glad we did.  We were seated immediately and quickly got chips and salsa.  Hubby said it was the best restaurant salsa he's ever had.  I thought it was very fresh tasting and liked  how it still had some tomato chunks rather than being pureed.  We also tried their hot sauce.  Good stuff.  It had a nice bite and smoky flavor.  Our meals came out quickly, all fresh and piping hot.  Hubby got a combo plate.  He liked the taco and raved about the enchilada, but was disappointed by the bean tostada which lost its crunch fairly quickly...no one wants a soft tostada.  My shrimp picado was okay, but the shrimp were a tad overcooked.  I also wished it was spicier, but that's just my palate.  The hot sauce fixed that right up.  Rice and beans were good.  Our sons were happy with their quesadilla and chicken fingers.  Drinks never got low.

3.5 stars for that salsa, decent food, and the super quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant based on fellow yelp reviewers. My friend missed Mexican food he used to eat in San Diego, so I looked around and trying to find the closest I can find to what he is used to in San Diego.

I liked the decoration inside the restaurant and patio looked very inviting.  Waiter was friendly and took our order right away.  

Salsa was very tasty.  We ended up eating two bowls of them with chips.  We ordered shrimp picante, seafood enchilada, fish tacos. All were good, cannot decided which was my favorite.  For desert, we had fried ice cream (free for a birthday boy), flan, and apple pie on hot skillet.  Everything was so tasty, price was reasonable, great atmosphere, good service.  I will definitely come back again when I want to eat good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Manuel's is the greatest food mistake I have ever made. I have lived in Moon Valley for 25 years and it took me 23 years to discover this place.  We now eat here a couple of times per week.  They have excellent specials with the best being the carnitas on Thursday.  There is no doubt these are the best carnitas in Arizona.  Saturday and Sunday breakfasts are a hidden gem.  The food comes out quick and the service is tremendous.  They treat everyone like family.  I have met Wally the owner and he is just a great genuine guy.  The team he has is tremendous.  Jason, Rick, Shawn just to name a few.  Everyone is friendly and attentive.  I have eaten at a thousand restaurants all over the world and really can't tell you one that is run better.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Everything was just great about Manuel's! From the starter nachos with a huge bowl of excellent salsa to the substantial and delicious fajitas to the super-flavorful enchiladas. The tortillas for the fajitas were very large so just a couple of BIG fajitas rolled up are quite filling. But of course we had to try enchiladas and they didn't disappoint. Very tasty beef, almost as good chicken, and interesting and very good spinach were all part of the three amigos.

Alas, no room for dessert, but we'll be back and we'll try to leave some room!"}
{"text":"This experience was embarrassing. Let me preface this by saying that I have never left a review for any place, and I am not a complaining person. But this warrants a mention because the food is great, but the service was beyond HORRIBLE. It felt like a hostage situation. Took an hour for food to arrive, when it did, one order was wrong and there for no tortillas for fajitas. Saw our server again about 15 minutes after the food came, asked for tortillas...45 minutes later and we had never seen her come by again. Waited another 30 minutes for the check. Never got it. Finally had to go to the hostess desk to get the check. Noticed multiple other tables having a similar experience with different servers. 

Please get better staff. Your food is great, but we will not be visiting again for a very long time. I should also add we brought out of state guests with us and it was embarrassing to have such a horrid experience."}
{"text":"Charlotte was that waitress who you remember, as a kid, was liked by mom, dad, and even your brothers/sisters, too!  She had a 6-table station rocking, and didn't miss a beat with my daughter (hand-made chocolate milk), son (half lemonade, half H20, soda topper), & me (monster beer) while keeping the hot chips and flavorful salsa coming.  Daughter's Chicken Strips, oddly enough, are by far the best tasting, highest quality, great portioned meal (along with generous helping of steak fries) in any restaurant, MExican or otherwise.  Son's taco combo and my own salad both absolutely solid in their selection.

This was our second straight great experience at Manuel's on Bell Rd.  They also have cheap Dos Equis (everyday!) and frequent F&B specials, they stretch my $ a bit, so I can see returning again soon."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and the service is always spot on. For some reason the chips and salsa seemed a little off? Don't get me wrong, the chips were still nice and warm but they tasted old? If that makes sense? The salsa was a little more watery than I remember? I will chalk it up to an off night as it happens. I will say that their tortilla soup was great and had a nice kick to it ( although I could have definitely had a little more). The pina colada I had was decent although it tasted more like a virgin but it was still good. Will I be back, sure why not. Like I said maybe it was just an off night. :)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Took forever to get waited on. When the order arrived, it was screwed  up. Asked for ground beef taco. it was shredded. Server said the cook is \"in love.\" what does that mean? she got the order right. I ate it anyway, but no offer to take it off the bill. Next time Popos."}
{"text":"Always good food but we waited 1 hour  for our to go order that was called in the night before and supposed to be ready at a specific time.  An hour later we finally got it with the excuse, sorry we're busy. Well it was called in the night before so they forgot us At least 6 other to go orders got they're food while we were waiting.  They did make it better by giving us a partial refund . If you're having a party don't rely on them for a time. This actually happened for my sons grad party to go order also and we had 75 people waiting on us."}
{"text":"Been here on many occasions as this location is literally down or up the street from my home. This location is always packed to where cars are parked along the sidewalks, especially for happy hour. I was here for a family event! Had a nice time on a weeknight and had myself two tasty beef tacos with Spanish rice. The margarita was not the best tasting, but no complaints from me being I had to work the next day!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and EXCELLENT real authentic Mexican food! I had the cheese enchilada with rice and beans and my husband loved his pollo especial dish, both were very delicious. Our waitress was sweet and very attentive to our table. The owner even came over and introduced himself to us, realizing this was our first time at his restaurant. He gave us a $10 coupon to come back and use on our next visit. This is something I really value and appreciate because you just don't find good quality customer service these days. My husband and I are new to the area and we will definitely be coming back to this place. Prices we're more than reasonable and they even sent us home with extra chips and salsa at NO charge!"}
{"text":"Service is slipping, but food is still good. This past week my wife and I waited for 10 minutes at the hostess desk to be seated. This entire time nobody came to seat us while at least three servers saw us multiple times. I could not wait any longer as it was lunchtime and I had to eat and get back to work. It will be some time before we give them another shot, but the food is worth another attempt."}
{"text":"Was meeting up with some friends for dinner and Manuel's was the place picked so off to dinner we went!

After checking out the menu, I went with the Pollo Especial. It was a deep-fried burrito with shredded chicken and green chili inside topped with a green chili sauce, cheese and jalapeno cream cheese sauce and came with a side of beans & rice.

The burrito was good, chicken was tender and moist, not dried out, I really could have done with out the beans and rice. The only complaint I have, and its not really one but for me it is , the burrito is cut into 3 pieces, instead of leaving it whole. I don't know why that is done but they are all served that way. I just don't like it haha 

Service was friendly and fast and our server was great, she kept on top of the refills and on whatever needs anyone had.

Had a good dining experience, I am sure I will be back."}
{"text":"We frequent Manuel's a couple of times a month. I think it warrants 3.5 stars but since we go often I'm going to bump it up rather than down.

I prefer sitting at the bar or \"Cantina\" area of Manuel's.  The couple of times we sat in the dining room the service was not really up to par.  Each time in the dining room, our server went missing and our food took a very long time.  Bad luck maybe... 

The food is usually pretty good and I am very critical of my mexican food!  My BF and I often share the fajitas for two.  We get a chicken/steak combo and request our veggies grilled with EVOO for a heart healthier version.  It's a ton of food and we each get our own side of beans, guac, sour, etc... I always have leftovers.  

A few times when I've felt indulgent, I've also enjoyed the Tres Amigos Enchiladas.  YUM! It's a enchilada trio (carne asada meat, chicken, spinach or cheese).  It's delicious.

I'm not really a fan of the Chicken Taco Salad.  I've only had it once and that was when I popped in for a quick lunch.  First, they serve the taco shell bowl on a very small plate so you can break the shell and mix up your salad.  That annoyed me and I had to request a larger plate.  On this visit, the chicken was dry and the guac was slightly brown.  It just didn't look appetizing at all.  I left hungry and $10 poorer.         

The salsa is also very fresh and flavorful.  They serve a \"medium\" and \"hot\" version.  I like to combine the two for a custom salsa."}
{"text":"Our family was looking for another Mexican restaurant last night and couldn't find it when we stumbled upon Manuels. The place was packed, which is usually a good sign. The hostesses seemed a little confused and disoriented, but after we finally got seated, the service was excellent and the food was fabulous. I grew up in New Mexico and Arizona and I think this restaurant has very authentic southwestern flair mexican food. We will go back."}
{"text":"Love to come here for lunch and order the taco salad with Chicken. Came with our son today and his lunch was free. Great atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Growing up, my family and I would eat at Manuel's all the time after church.  I have always been a fan of their salsa, and especially their beans.  The beans at a mexican restaurant are the main factor that determines whether or not I will return.  I am somewhat of a bean expert.  Manuel's beans pass muster.  I am also a big fan of their frozen margaritas.  Unlike some other mexican restaurants, you can actually tell that they put tequila in the margarita.  The lime flavor doesn't taste fake.   I worked at Manuel's for a semester in college, and I still enjoy their food and drinks."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Manuel's in awhile...Tonight's dinner was very good! Extra tasty, fresh and authentic. I had a combination #2  Service was excellent, friendly. Brandi was our server. My family and I will be coming back SOON...thank you."}
{"text":"I have always loved Manuel's but never reviewed it before. We have always had a great time with excellent margaritas. The food is good I have probably tried most everything on the menu and would recommend ... The Pollo Especial, the spinach enchiladas and the cheese crisps are great with chips and salsa when you just want to drink, chat and munch."}
{"text":"First timer on suggestion from customer. The tortilla chips were very nice and crispy and salsa was great. The chips did not have the old oil taste that some places serve. We ordered the cheese crisp which is sort of like an open faced quesadilla. Wow, with the salsa, it was great with the cheese stretching like some of the good pizzas. I ordered the lunch special flauta with chicken. It was only one but it was very filling with the rice and beans."}
{"text":"I love this place. My family has been coming here for years and the food is awesome. The owners are extremely nice and the staff is always on top of their tables. Get the Margiritta in fact get two."}
{"text":"I like it. Chimi & Margaritas.  Winner!"}
{"text":"Charles was are server tonight and he was great! The food was also great! The music was not to loud and we could chat with our friends"}
{"text":"I just can't give enough praise for Manuel's restaurant. I have eaten here countless times over the years and they never fail to impress me. The food is always fresh and delicious and service is quick and efficient. Green corn tamales are my go to meal here as they are absolutely the best I have ever tasted   The salsa is to die for and my hubby loves the hot sauce and chimichangas. Margaritas are also excellent. They are  open for breakfast on weekends and there is nothing like good Mexican food for a hangover!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Manuel's in years and remembered it as being decent.  I went recently and the service was poor, the food was cold and bland.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"We loved it! Great service, great prices, clean and yummy food! Love the chips and salsa!!"}
{"text":"Second time is usually the charm right? Came here a third time and well...

Sat down and waited 10 minutes before a server came to take our drink orders.

The hostess and servers were too busy making jokes and playing around. If you got time to lean you got time to clean, not the case with this place. \"I work off tips anyways, why not just shoot the sh** with my friends on the clock?\"

Put our food order in and it came out wrong because our server didn't \"write it down\". She did question what I ordered like it was my fault... Not sure how anyone can mistakenly miss-order a taco.

Drinks never got refilled, but atleast the food was good.

2 stars, there definitely won't be a fourth time here."}
{"text":"It is so stupid you have to pay almost 6.00 dollars for chips and salsa with a Togo order when it is free inside all you can eat. Good food other then that."}
{"text":"A large group of us went in this past Monday evening. It was quite busy and due to some renovations their seating had been temporarily cut in half. The manager was very accommodating, even to go so far as to offer to put up non smoking signs on the patio so we would have a comfortable place for our younger diners. The food is absolutely amazing, the spinach enchiladas are a favorite! The salsa is fresh, the chips are warm, and the service excellent. This is our new go to Mexican!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here tonight and it was the worst service we've ever had. We had a waitress named Brandi and she was terrible. She didn't do ANYTHING but take our drink order, which btw she didn't even bring. The bus boy looked confused and said \"did she take your drink order?\" I said yes she did but then never brought them. He brought us our drinks, our chips and salsa, and all of our refills, someone else brought us our cheese crisp, someone else brought us our food which had obviously sitting under the heat lamp for a long time since the rice was completely dry and clumpy and the beans were burned to the plate. It was just an all around bad experience. I live 3 mins from this place and I will GLADLY drive to Popo's at 59th and bell where the service and food are ALWAYS good."}
{"text":"Our fav, love the margaritas. Shantelle is a great waitress, very attentive. They have a great patio, too."}
{"text":"This is probably not the best place to eat authentic Mexican food.   The place was a total disappointment.  The young ladies seating us were completely disinterested in new customers and more into their own conversations. The family behind us walked out.  After being seated away from other diners, an employee kept sweeping the floor near our table.  Ewww.  The food was mediocre at best and completely smothered in some kind of sauce with huge chunks of onion.  Not exactly as the menu picture showed.   My family was disappointed as I was when the bill came.  Over priced for cheap and greasy food."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place!  We meet there every 2nd Saturday .. some weeks I have great service and they are sooo accomodating and friendly.. other weeks I feel like I'm imposing by giving them my business... Today's meeting was a love one...."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come from Buffalo,NY and enjoy every year.  Love the fajitas the best."}
{"text":"I'm an Arizona native, and I have tried a lot of Mexican food at a lot of places, and I can honestly say that Manuel's has the best food in town, bar none! It's consistent, delicious, and everything, including the salsa and hot sauce, is made fresh every single day. How do I know? I asked. No wonder it's so good! Prices are very fair too, especially in a restaurant that is so nice inside. You'll pay as much for a meal in a drive-through dive as you do here, and you sure won't get the great atmosphere of the beautiful dining room! And the Cantina is wonderful, and so much fun. Choose a seat at the huge U-shaped bar, or sit at a table. You'll enjoy either one.  For us folks a wee bit older, it's like your own version of Cheers.

Great service, friendly servers, fabulous food, and clean restrooms...can't beat it! A wonderful, family-owned business.  If you don't go, you're really missing out!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Manuel's, but the last time I was there, we got stuck in the bar area and it was quite loud. The place was packed, so, we couldn't really move. It was really hard to hear everyone. 

The cool thing is that they actually turned down the radio/tv so, we ended up being able to hear better. 

They recently redid their bar and patio area, and it is a lot nicer now.  Check out Manuel's if you want a solid Mexican food in the North Valley."}
{"text":"Great atmoshere four lunch. Chips were fresh. 2 salsasto choose from, mild and hot. The hot is about a 6 out of 10, not too bad. Both are really good. I got teh chicken taco and cheese enchilada. Potion were very nice! Refreid beanswere some of the best I've ever had. $12 lunch, service was great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Try to go here whenever we are in Phoenix. Great house margaritas, love the chips and salsa, I drink their coffee black over ice, love the pollo especiale, beef chimis with nortino sauce, albondiga soup, chocolate milk shakes... The food may not be \"genuine\" Mexican, but it's really good. They just redecorated to a modern Mexican style that is quite \"tasteful\" (haha pardon the pun) and classy. They kept the Mexican music that we enjoy. Great for large family gatherings or quiet couple evenings. Ladies restroom is usually clean and pleasant."}
{"text":"So let me start off with jerry was very nice. Cool guy. BUT... we were there waaayyy tooo long. There was this one guy who kept looking at us, my ole lady's water cup didn't have any water for most of the time, and I had to \"share\" with her. The funny thing is it wasn't even busy. Like for real. Also when we got our chips I thought i saw a bug, so I took out all the chips from the bowl, and couldn't find it. I also went to the bathroom, and the whole floor was covered in urine. I would've told somebody that, but  well you see the workers were too busy just looking at us. It could be because my girlfriend is a smoking hot blonde and what not, but still. Other then that the food was pretty good. I would go back."}
{"text":"Manuels is one of those places for me. I grew up eating at the old 32nd street and Indian School road location as a child in the early 70's. Not much has changed except no orange booths. 

Met up with some friends last night and some may have muscle memory, it appears I have taste bud memory lol. The salsa and hot sauce haven't changed at all. The chips weren't hot and that was a drag. 

I had a fluata, cheese enchilada and beans. The enchilada sauce is good and loads of cheese. The flauta was nothing special but good. 

Although Manuel's isn't my \"go to\" place for Mexican food it was enjoyable but most of my stars go for nostalgia ."}
{"text":"Service was fine, a bit too fast as usual for a Mexican restaurant. My partner ordered chicken fajita. Either the chicken was pork or it was over cooked. When we asked about it, the waitress assured us that it was chicken. But, the alleged chicken was hard, chewy, crunchy, and nasty. Got a take-away box, but threw out the disgusting meal as soon as we got home."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times when I am down in Phoenix. I usually order a chile relleno, cheese enchilada and rice. Also their chicken and beef dishes are great and not too dry. Great chips and salsa. The overall quality of the food is excellent. Very good customer service. One of the best Mexican food restaurants in the area. Give them a try."}
{"text":"My family loves to go here! The food is good, the price is good and it's not hard to get a table. My favorite is the mix and match green corn tamale and chicken taco."}
{"text":"I was won over by a few previous reviews that praised salsa and flavor.  I'm wondering if they ate at one place and reviewed for another.  

Ever the optimist, I'll start off with the good.  Chips and salsa arrived quickly, and the chips were hot, light and crispy.  Drink orders were taken quickly after we sat down.  Service was friendly.  The menu wasn't overwhelming and had good descriptions and pictures of the offerings.  Overall, the server was attentive and friendly throughout the evening.

Now for the not-so-good... Please don't get me started on the salsa.  It's just... no.  Let's talk about things canned tomatoes are OK to be in:  Spaghetti sauce.  Cans.  Velveeta queso.  Things that canned tomatoes should not be in:  Oreos.  Iced tea.  Salsa.  

The green corn tamale made me sad inside.  The masa was gritty and dry.  Maybe that's why it was smothered in some bizarre grey/green gravy.  The masa-to-filling ratio was also not great with very thick masa and the tiniest of smears of filling.  The flavor of the outside of the tamale - at least the one small part that wasn't smothered in weird grey/green gravy - was actually not bad (delicately sweet), but it definitely was not worth the near $6 ala carte price.

I had really high hopes for this place, but it just fell flat."}
{"text":"Came in with my autistic son who has major sensory needs and does not eat any food at any restaurant. I brought in some outside food for him and was told by the manager that I could not do that... his name was Jason and he was so rude. My son may never eat typical foods...How are parents supposed to go out if they have a child that only eats certain foods? Does this mean no baby food for an toddler? What about breast milk? Is that considered outside food? I'm so disgusted by the actions of this manger that this restaurant will be off our list from now on!! Shame on them!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant. People are friendly food is awesome!!! 
Salsa is very good and chips are served warm and aren't greasy like some other places."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great Mexican food.  They have some of the best beans in town, and that is the mark of a great Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This place used to be OK but it is gone downhill fast. Tonight I went with the family and the food was awful and the service was bad. We never got our bill and had to go up to the cash register to ask for it. When we expressed our concern to the manager he didn't seem to care or ask how he could remedy the situation. This is our last trip."}
{"text":"Lame. Slow at every possible opportunity -- took 10 minutes to take our order. Then 20 minutes for food to arrive. Wife ordered chicken taco, got beef. Was not hot. Talked to manager. Didn't offer a discount. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My parents come here with their friends every Friday night.  They call it \"Margarita Friday\".  I occasionally accompany them.  This place is always packed, but my parents have the same table reserved for them every week so we always get right in.  However, it looks like it could be quite a wait if you just walk in, especially on a weekend.  They have my absolute favorite hot sauce in the world....not the salsa, the hot sauce.  Frequently, you have to ask for the hot sauce.  It is well worth it.  For straight up gringo Mexican food, I have always found it to be tasty and consistent.  My parents dig their margaritas. (I'm not a fan of tequila ever since The Mescal Incident of 2000).  You can't go wrong here with your standard shredded beef taco.  They are plump and juicy and not too greasy.  You will need some napkins for these though.  I wouldn't order them on a first date.  I love the green corn tamales with green chile gravy as I am a bit of a green chile slut.  Beans and rice are well executed.  They will bring you flour chips instead of corn if you want and keep the chips and salsa comin....Service is always good.  The noise level is a bit high, but not as obnoxious as most of the trendier restaurants in town.....It is just always crowded.  It is a local family owned establishment which is always a thumbs up in my book. Solid across the board!"}
{"text":"Okay, now you must ask...why five stars for a Mexican food chain?? Well, maybe I am bias, this was my second job ever. I worked at a Manuel's (the one on Cave Creek rd) 20 years ago. Loved it then, love it now. I know the ins and outs of this place. It is still good, their hot sauce is still the BEST and being an American Mexican food joint, it isn't bad, no actually, it is good! I always get the same thing, chicken street tacos...so lame, but I keep going back because I love them and they are seriously good! My boyfriend got the green chile corn tamale meal, soooo good!! A super tasty house marg here is like $3.50 and the red chile quesadilla is a force to be reckoned with, spot on. We will continue to come here, I will continue to be excited about it and service is always excellent along with a very clean restaurant .

Keep it up Manuel's, job well done and much appreciated :)"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! The chalupas were huge and delish. Their carnitas street tacos were succulent and flavorful.  Service was impeccable as well."}
{"text":"We had Tiffany as our waitress, we wanted something something different as in steak  with cheese sauce on it...identical to fajitas...but without the tortilla...she was extremely rude, advised us we had to order something off the menu...that they couldn't make that...this is not brain surgery...just leave the tortillas......she only served us, never asked us if we wanted anything else...could not be bothered...please get another job...!!!.."}
{"text":"Great service here! A lot cleaner than your usual mexican rest. Big bar area and large dinning area as well.  Great location, away from all normal trendy stuff. Get there and enjoy."}
{"text":"We recently (12/19) stopped in for a late breakfast on Saturday morning.  We decided to go out and eat, and couldn't think of where we wanted to go.  I had seen the sign on the window earlier in the week stating that Manuel's had breakfast on the weekends.  My wife and I love Mexican food for breakfast, and decided to give it a try.

Manuel's on Bell Road has been recommended to us before by our neighbors who frequently eat there.  I also used to go to Manuel's on Cave Creek Road a lot, back in the day (early 1980's) when I lived close to that location.

Due to it being late in the morning, I called the restaurant ahead of time to see if breakfast was still being served.  The young lady that I spoke with told me they serve breakfast all day on the weekend.  When we arrived, the parking lot was very full, and we were worried about getting a seat, but there were plenty of seats available when we walked in.

Then the wait began...

Like many other Yelpers whose reviews I read, service (or lack of) seems to be the biggest issue with this restaurant.  

I'll start with the hostess...I'm not picky; but if you're going to be playing hostess, at least have a smile and try to make the customer feel welcome.  Also, if breakfast is a big thing for your restaurant on the weekends, include a breakfast menu when you seat your patrons. 

After we were seated, we waited almost 10 minutes for the young man serving chips and salsa to bring us some.  At least 2 servers/assistants walked by our table while we were waiting, and just looked at us.  To be honest, we were just getting ready to leave when the chips/salsa showed up.

About 5 minutes later (but probably longer...), our waiter (according to my receipt-Chris B) decided to put in an appearance, and take our drink orders and retrieve a breakfast menu.
I'm still waiting for the lemon I ordered for my drink...

Okay, enough for right now about the sterling service; and on to the food!

The chips and salsa were good.  The chips seemed a little old, but were warm and tasty.  2 salsas were brought out, a chunky mild which was good, and a smooth hot sauce which was very good (reminded me of La Canasta's or Valle Luna's).

My wife and I both had breakfast burritos, they were big and tasty, packed full of food.  My wife had bacon, egg, and potato; I had chorizo, egg, potato, and beans.  The only thing not perfect about my burrito, is that the tortilla seemed a little hard.  My burrito was very large, and I actually left about 2 small bites, it was plenty to fill me up.  Both the chorizo and the refried beans in the burrito were good and very tasty.  Junior is off of his bean burrito kick right now, and had a cheeseburger and fries; the burger looked very good (he said it was), and the fries were good.  

Drink refills were hard to come by, since our server did his best at not being around; except when it was time to drop off the bill.

About the bill, $22.58.  Not bad for 2 big burritos, a kid's cheeseburger and fries, 3 drinks, and a couple of bowls of chips and salsa!

Will we be back?  Not likely anytime in the near future.  The food was good and tasty (3.5 stars); but oh the service (.5 star)...

The poor service will keep us away from what is a nice, clean family owned Mexican restaurant.  Hint to Chris B, if you want to work in the customer service industry, try providing customer service.  Your tip would have been 3 times what you received; since I am usually a generous tipper, and I'm even more so during the holidays."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food at any price, anywhere. We go out for lunch and dinner every single day 7 days a week .there is no Mexican food restaurant that compares  !!!"}
{"text":"After my prior experience, I ended up going back to this place out of desperation for some Mexican food, several times in fact, and as of this writing, I still don't have a suitable substitute. That said, I'm pretty sure I won't be going back at all anymore. I'm done, just utterly and completely done, with this place. 

Why? Well for starters, the service has not improved, despite numerous complaints and having spoken to the owner personally. Same servers still working there, still delivering crap service. Same waiters pulling the same tactics (start good, then disappear) and always the same excuses (I got busy, they have me all over the place, etc.). Latest hilarity ensued when a regular server, whom we've been tipping 20%+, handed us off to another gal because, in her words, she was pretty busy and wanted to make sure we didn't get bad service. The other gal gave us worse service than we'd had in a long time. Good intentions don't really help me get my drink refilled or bring the check this century. 

Secondly, the food quality seems to be taking a dive. I say this as someone that regularly orders the same stuff, to the point where it was sometimes awkward because the server would ask me if I was having my usual meal. So you can imagine that it's not too difficult for me to perceive a trend over time, at least insofar as how they prepare the dishes I keep ordering over and over. The meat? Seems to have less flavor and taste less fresh more often than not, especially the beef. Sauces? Unpredictable amount of heat. Some days you burn your mouth off on the green sauce in the \"Three Amigos\", other days you get more kick from the free chips and salsa. Go figure. I also noticed the steak in the \"Tampiquenas Dinner\", which used to be excellent, is now served straight out of a microwave and is limp, tasteless, soaking wet and completely inedible. They ask you how you want it cooked, but no matter what I have said, it comes out well done and clearly microwaved. In a word, it's just disgusting now and I've had to stop ordering it. Most recently I ventured into their \"Chimichanga Dinner\" item, opting for chicken. First time it came out with beef, but I was so hungry I ate it anyway and didn't complain. Second and third time, consistent with the first time, it came out less than adequately fried and soggier than I care for. If it's just a wet tortilla with semi-crisp/crunchy end pieces, I hate to break it to you, but that's not a chimichanga. If I wanted a burrito, I'd have ordered one, right? Beyond that, even the rice doesn't come out consistent. Sometimes mush, sometimes perfect, more often than not, though, it comes out hard and chewy. How do you screw up rice at a Mexican restaurant? 

Last but certainly not least, I need to point out the recent renovations to the dinning area. I once considered this place to have some of the nicest classic Mexican restaurant ambiance I had found in the valley. The floor tiles, the wall full of photos, the artwork and the decor, the wood beams and wrought iron adorning the walls and ceiling outcroppings, the circular corner booths, subdued colors and walled off drink/check stations. Heck, even the paintings hanging on the walls and the murals and artwork painted on the walls themselves were true to the theme. You walked into this place and you knew you were in a Mexican restaurant. Now, however? They've ruined all of that. Utterly and completely ruined it. 

You step into the dining area today and you find green, yes light green booths (mixed with a few dark chocolate colored ones) bright turquoise and white walls, dark brown/grey roof paneling and even faux-wood laminate on the walls. The pictures are gone, the murals are gone, the overhead decorations are gone. If it were not for the Mexican tracks pouring out of the speakers, you could be easily forgiven for thinking you had wandered into some kind of ridiculously pretentious coffee and sandwich shop, designed to attract millennials and hipsters. What in the heck were they thinking? To add insult to injury, or perhaps the converse would be more apt, the booths are horrifically stiff and remarkably uncomfortable. It is bad enough that we actually witnessed a couple of geriatrics get up, tell their server \"this (booth) sucks, we're moving\" and proceed to take an open table next to a screaming baby instead. 

These people should be ashamed of themselves for what they've done to this place. It no longer looks at all like a Mexican restaurant, no longer feels like a Mexican restaurant and, even if you could get past the pretentious, hipster coffee shop ambiance, the food is sub-par at best. I really have no idea what they were thinking, but they better hope there are a lot of pretentious hipsters out there looking for over priced, below-average Mexican food and shoddy service in a restaurant that is, like them, trying too hard to be edgy and different.

Absolute fail."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service.  Went in tonight with my son and was seated promptly. Chips were brought to the table immediately.  After that, nothing! Staff passed by our table without ever greeting us or taking drink order. Waited 15 minutes before getting up and leaving. I have been coming here for years but the service has declined greatly.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"By far my go to for Mexican food. I can't get past the seafood enchiladas. I ordered it every time I go there. Get there as fast as you can and have a margarita while you're there."}

My husband, myself and our 2 kids went. Everyone was extremely happy and the kids meals and choices were the best I've ever seen in a 
restaurant. Our server was wonderful and helpful on making choices and keeping up with us. We saw Wednesday's they do kids eat free... we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever.  We were sat and then ignored.  Two tables came in after us, one on either side of us and they got drinks and chips & salsa.   Needless to say, we walked out."}

I've eaten a lot of tamales over the years--little tiny ones--their sauce is pretty darn good also...  the $29.00 for the 12 is a very inexpensive price once you experience them..  and don't for get that lovely sauce..  

Manuel's   5 STAR Quality!!  

Thank You!

Cheers,

{"text":"Great food, reasonably priced and they recentky updated their decor.   It looks great!"}
{"text":"Had the special which included a shredded beef taco and enchilada.  The shredded beef was petrified!  When asked how we enjoyed it, we replied that we didn't care for it and the waiter, Emo, had no response.  Why ask? I'll go elsewhere next time.  

Out of town visitors....please don't mistake this for what Arizona Mexican food should taste like! No Bueno!"}
{"text":"Our Neighborhood use to have the best Mexican food spots - use to being the key words here. This lack of excellence is what lead us to Manuel's on bell. Unfortunately this is not a Glory Story for the Masses looking for Excellence as well in the Neighborhood- this is a tale of mediocre over salted food with a cast of Bartenders and servers who should be Replaced. 

First we are bar sitters :) we like to sit @the bar close to the beer!  I find that service is also faster @the bar in most places. Not that we are in a hurry - we love long fun dinners! We also love fun nice bartenders- that does not exist here. I have never been around such stiff rude bartenders in my life! Asking them to get you another drink even when the place is empty seems like a chore to them. When they are not staring daggers at the patrons they are standing in the back left corner of the bar restaurant area talking to servers and anyone but the customers.

Now the food is hit and miss. Somethings are great like the cheese crisp with green chilies or the happy hr rolled tacos- for the most part the rest of the menu is over-salted and lacks a fresh taste. This alone is disappointing due to that we are located in the heart of Mexican culture and food being in AZ so the food should reflect that- it shouldn't taste like a Mexican food restaurant in Idaho. Dumping tons of salt on food does not count as \"great flavor\" btw.

To be honest we went over what was worse the service or the food - we decided the service. The bartenders are just so rude. It is like they have been there so long that they just hate everything to do with the place yet stay! The older lady could possibly been the worst. She just came across angry. She also charged us for salsa after we bought chips to go - they usually come with salsa. That was a first. We tried this place numerous times hoping we just caught the bartenders on an off day - everyday there apparently is an off day. 

Overall don't go. There are so many other undiscovered gems out there - where they love there job and are happy to talk to patrons- grab em a drink - and take your money with a smile :) cheers!"}
{"text":"Stopped for menudo recently and it was amazingly delicious .  The staff was attentive.  Will be back soon hopefully"}
{"text":"It has been 10 plus years since coming Manuel's and we were very pleasantly surprised,  the food was pretty good, and very reasonably priced.  I am glad we gave them a try and know we will give the Goodyear location a try. 

I can only say that the lack of attention by the hostess stand almost cause us to leave.  so if  management reads this I might suggest you review the non attention you get when you arrive. 

I do believe I would have given 5 stars had they not taken almost 8 minutes to acknowledge us when they're were not busy,  we came around 330."}
{"text":"This is my first official yelp review And its just to bad it has to be a bad one. I Ordered some take out today from Manuels and when I came home and tried eating my chips and salsa it was clearly bad. When you leave something out that's meant to be refrigerated the container expands. When I opened the salsa it let out a burst of air like it had been sitting out for awhile. Although I found it weird I still tried it and it was definitely Bad. It had a very sour taste to it and smell.  I asked my company that had also ordered food if they thought it was bad and they agreed. I've eaten here plenty of times but seems like the quality and service has gone down lately unfortunately. I probably won't be returning and will be looking for a New Mexican restaurant. Heard the hole in the wall Mexican restaurant   on northern and 19av (south east corner) was amazing and had decent prices. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal!! I have been coming here for 20 years! Everything is delicious! I especially love the enchiladas and shredded beef tacos! The  sopapillas are outstanding! Chimichangas are also AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"First time in here and enjoyed the atmosphere. The bar looked well kept and the bartenders were very friendly. Sean was my bartender and he always checked on me. I will definitely come back for the patron margarita!! Lol it was fantastic"}
{"text":"Good chips and salsa is about all the positive I have to say about Manuel's on this visit.  The food quality was lacking - oversalted and grisley steak, greasy quesadilla my daughter rung out before eating and wilted lettuce strewn about the plates.  All of the prices are REALLY high for the quality of the food and it seems like there are NO more affordable options.  Even the kids menu is high ($5.50 plus extra for juice) and their emphatic NO SUBSTITUTIONS is frustrating.  The happy hour menu looks more promising but for a Family, it's a NO THANK YOU.  Sadly we won't be back to Manuel's any time soon."}
{"text":"I came here with my Grandma for lunch and I have to say I enjoyed it! They've definitely got a theme going on that's sort of eclectic and charming. We sat outside because the patio is nice with fountains and such and who doesn't want some fresh AZ air while we can get it!? I ordered the Baja Fish Tacos and I was definitely satisfied - they were so good!

They give you chips and salsa when you sit down, which I love! I liked that it wasn't spicy and that they ask you if you want a spicy version. We don't all like spice!

The ONLY caveat to all of this is that our waitress came over to the table a little TOO much. She was very nice, but came over at least 10 times and we were only there for an hour maybe hour and a half. It can get a little bothersome when you're trying to have a conversation.

It's also a little pricey for Mexican food ($13 bucks for two tacos!), but other than that, the place was nice, the food was good - I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First off let me say I have eaten Mexican food in many places Mexico, Arizona, Unfortunately California, New Mexico, TEXAS, Budapest Hungry,  Bosnia and throughout the rest of the USA.

How difficult is it to use a marinade or even season as you cook? Must be nearly impossible. 

This is horrible Mexican food period. Velveeta cheese dip with spinach for $9.

My Beef fajitas had 3 times the unseasonably veggies than meat. The meat is fatty with no flavor other than bland walmart tasting beef. Both sets of flour tortias were old and fell apart. how can you not make tortillas? HOW

My wife had a super soggy chicken enchilada.  WAter must be the dominate flavor. The taco is just hideous to eat. Tastes like a boild paste.  I'm not sure even my dogs will eat it. 

My Family will never eat here again. 10 stars all down"}
{"text":"luckily we got there in time for happy hour and to make this review 3 stars vs 2.  i ordered the street tacos from the happy hour menu and it was $4 for 4 tacos.  they tasted ok.  beers were $3 and margaritas were $2 off.  it was ok."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, mostly with coworkers on our lunch break. Chips and salsa are really good. Today I had the carnitas lunch special and had them sub corn tortillas for flour, with no problem, and it was really tasty. Another coworker got the fajitas which she really enjoyed. Our server today was John and he was on the ball!"}
{"text":"Good chips and salsa, excellent service.  Friendly folks who greet you well and say good-bye when you leave.  MY staff love this place and I gave them gift cards for Xmas from here so they could go to lunch and talk about the boss!

Food is good but not great.  Not high-end Mexican but decent ingredients put together with care.  I highly recommend asking about their specials.  They are thinking about what they prepare and have some excellent dishes they have created themselves.  The spicy roast pork is very good - as an example.

Parking can be tough at peak hours.  I had to use the street last night and the place was absolutely packed.  Large lot but at peak hours...

Very good value.  You will leave knowing you have eaten something!

Decor is basic Mexican restaurant but comfortable."}
{"text":"This place is so nice and the food was great...glad they got kid friendly food.... for sure we will be back...."}
{"text":"We celebrated my father in-laws 80th birthday there last night and our server was Allison! She was excellent, friendly, very attentive! Food was perfect and came out Hot (which I love). Beer was ice cold and Margarita was so good! Thank you Allison for a great birthday dinner service! You ROCK"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? It's always a great spot to come in to the bar, grab a stool, order some food and drink. The food is decent and the price is fair. The atmosphere is always lively.
The staff is friendly and quick to service. Check out their specials and come catch a game sometime."}
{"text":"We are regulars here, and they have been telling us for MONTHS that happy hour will be back when football starts. Football is back, happy hour is NOT. We will find another hang out. The food is mediocre at best. We have been loyal because it is close to our place of worship. We bring a big group every Sunday, but we are not feeling appreciated and now we feel lied to. So.....moving on. See ya!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after truck shopping. Salsa was tasty, as was cheese enchilada lunch, but hubby's Tampiqueña steak was overdone & served with rice that we'd asked to be kept off his plate. Guacamole was also good. Service was friendly (even if she was literally in hubby's face!), though drink refills took a while to do & at the end, nonexistent. Won't be back, just too far from home."}
{"text":"This place is great. We've only gone twice and done two orders for take out. Service is always friendly and quick. HH is the time to go. Margaritas are my go to. Steak tacos were tasty, fishy tacos yummy and my hubby always goes for the polo special, which is basically pollo magnifico if you remember Julios in Scottsdale. Like the chesse crisps as well. Nice large outside patio off the bar area. Plenty of seating with every sports game imaginable in the inside bar portion. If you live in the area highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have yet to experience a bad meal here. The red enchilada sauce is the absolute BEST! I am a Phoenix native, so I know good Mexican food. Spinach enchilada, shredded chicken burrito, oh and don't forget the nachos! This is enough to fill two people up! The bar at the 11th ave and Bell location is very nice. They are open for brunch on Sundays during football season and have Sunday ticket. The bar tenders are extremely friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"Once again wonderful service at the bar.   There home made tamales are to die for.   Not to crazy either for Sunday night football.   Get place for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"My wife child and mother-in-law came into the restaurant for my wife's birthday.  She ordered a beef chimichanga.  When she got the meal and it was chicken.  She brought it to the attention of the server and he took the plate to fix the chimi.  When he came back with the new order my wife cut it open and it was still was chicken.  My wife again told the waiter and he ran to the back to again fix the order and left the incorrect plate. The manager came over and grabbed the plate and asked what can I get you.  My wife just wanted the right order finally came out and my wife ate after the rest of the table.  When the check came there was no compensation for the errors with the food. Even after informing the waiter that it was her birthday.  I understand mistakes happen but twice in a row and no free desert or the entree taken off the bill is bad customer service."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service! You definitely get your money worth here. Everything on the menu is so different from other Mexican restaurants. Try the spinach enchiladas, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good food, great service. Lunchtime deal is a bargain, and you still get all the yummy, crispy homemade chips and salsa you can eat.
GGGGOOOOAAAAALLLLLL"}
{"text":"I have been to a couple Manuel's.  Pretty standard sit down Mexican place.  It's clean, decent service, big building, etc. The food is decent.  Overall nothing special but not horrible either.  Pretty much everything is average and nothing stands out to me.  Eh. Pft."}
{"text":"Really great food. Guac was whipped awsomeness little pricey. Chicken on taco salad was steller. Yet my spinich enchaladas were blah. Service was really good."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have lunch together once a month and, more often than not, end up at Manuel's. Been coming here for years and have never been disappointed, I have recently discovered their carnitas and think they do a fine job with the pork. Large serving, tender and juicy and great refried beans. When I come with hubs, he loves the chicken chimi. Service is always good and ambiance is great!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service.  We were greeted and sat immediately despite the extremely full parking lot.  Charles was our waiter and he did an amazing job.  He greeted our guest when she arrived and caught her up to us with drinks and water.  The decor was very updated, comfortable and nice!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on my way home from work, and it seemed like the women rolling silverware was more focused on that then helping the people coming in. I stood for a while with the to go menu, no one acknowledged me, so I just walked up to the counter. I had a 20 voucher, and the women didn't know what to do with it and had to go get someone else. Kinda weird. We will see how the food tastes."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, yet to have bad food or service at Manuel's. Will recommend it any body"}
{"text":"Don't get the machaca! Everything else is great go here all the time but I want my 12 bucks back for my machaca chimi"}
{"text":"Best part of the meal was the mints handed with the check.  I'll make this short...my family WILL NOT be returning."}
{"text":"I usually judge Mexican restaurants by their salsa, which is average at best. Their Tortilla Soup changed my mind and my rating, hands down the best I have had."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. The chips were way better years ago when they were flour.  But they are still not bad today. We went through 4-5 bowls of chips for 4 people. Prices are a little high for Mexican food, thus -1 star.  Service is better than average here. I got a make my own combo so I could get a taco and an enchilada.

Albondigas soup is superb!"}
{"text":"My family and I have gone here since I was in grade school. We're all fans of the green corn tamale. It has this sweet sauce, so it might not be for everyone... but it is by far my favorite tamale around. The chips and salsa are always on point. I've been to many Mexican restaurants and I always end up comparing the chips to Manuel's... and they usually don't hold up like these. 2 great salsas as well.

The service is pretty good. I've gone for lunch twice in the past few weeks and everything has been speedy and friendly. Sat once in the dining area and once in the bar. The dining area is great for family time and the bar is great, especially if there is a ball game on. The ambiance is great and I definitely recommend Manuel's."}
{"text":"Manuels is a clean and great Mexican restaurant.  Lori served us like we were regulars, and it was my first visit.  The food excellent... BRAVO MANUELS"}
{"text":"The food was delicious.
I ordered the chicken fajitas and the portion was huge and costs $15.50.  It came with guacamole salsa and sour creme.  I recommend going to Manuel's if you want to have good Mexican food and have a fun time."}
{"text":"We've been here lots of times and never had a complaint until now.  The restaurant has been remodeled, I like it.  The service, which was never an issue, was HORRIBLE !!  Ok, I won't blame the server, I blame the kitchen.  It was packed for Mother's Day, but no excuse for waiting nearly an hour for our food when all we ordered was a mix 2 plate (beef taco, chicken enchilada w/ beans & rice - delicious). I mean you can only eat so many bowls of chips/salsa.  My son, who is 19, took me to dinner and he didn't need to hear the server complaining that she was tired, had been there since 7a.m. (now 4:30 p.m.) and she just wanted to get home and was trying to push our order through a larger party before us. Maybe lunch will be quicker, but not sure we will go to this location again."}
{"text":"Met my parents, son and an ex-coworker for a late lunch. Place was dead at 2:15 on a Tuesday. 

Was seated right away. An older waitress came over in about 5 minutes for our drink order. Chips and salsa came shortly thereafter. First, I must say I really am not a fan of Manuel's, I am loyal to the other M named Mexican restaurant in town. It's just my preference to the other guys salsa.

I ordered the 1 cheese enchilada lunch special, my son had the kids bean burrito. Both came with rice and beans. And I asked for a take out order for my husband so I didn't have to cook.

Waitress came back to the table to verify my son's order about 10 minutes later. Uh oh.  Food came out about 5 minutes later.

My enchilada arrived hot and cheesy. I have to say it was a good 4 stars. Rice and beans plentiful and fresh. 

My son's bean burrito had been plated on top of his side of beans so the tortilla was a soggy mess on the bottom so he would have had to eat with a fork. He wasn't happy so he ate his rice and mine. Left the burrito behind.

The to go order placed at the end of our meal.  One carne asada burro no pico or guacamole, enchilada style with rice and beans.  That meal came in about 10 minutes packaged nicely, or so I thought.

Imagine our surprise when I got home and my husband went to eat.  The burrito as wrapped in foil in a container. Giving the benefit of the doubt maybe the enchilada sauce was in one of the styro containers so the burrito didn't get soggy on the commute home. Nope, rice, beans and salsa. And to add insult to injury it was loaded with guac. More guac than meat.

I don't think the mistake was our servers because she repeated the order and I know she didn't place my son's burrito on top of his beans, all the mistakes came from the kitchen.

Service was fine, drinks never empty and restaurant and restrooms clean. 

Nothing today will make me switch my loyalties when it comes to Mexican dining and just validates my choice!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. The flavor and quality is good. I ordered the fajitas and taco salad this last visit. I'll be honest, I order fajitas almost every time I come here. They filled me up and I liked them. I keep coming back here so feel compelled to update my review. The service is was great tonight in the bar. The ambiance is unpretentious and relaxed, it's a nice sized place with authentic decor. I really like their chips and 2 types of salsa. Sometimes it takes more time to be sat and for the waitstaff to come to your table. Tonight though, everyone loved their meal and our waiter was very personable and helpful. This is my neighborhood Mexican joint, best in the area and better than dark, overrated Valle Luna. I will, of course, be back!"}
