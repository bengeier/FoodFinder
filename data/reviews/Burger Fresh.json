{"text":"Surprisingly my first visit to Burger Fresh was just last week.  I've been grocery shopping at Heinen's which is right next door for years and never bothered to stop.  So, instead of going grocery shopping hungry (bad idea) I stopped in for a quick bite.  First impression walking in, \"man this place is small\".  There are only a few tables in the middle and bar seating around the perimeter.    Each burger is made to order.  I ended up getting a double bacon burger and the \"Healthy Fries\".  Before we get into the burger, let me take a moment and elaborate on the \"Healthy Fries\".  First off, they are NOT healthy.  As the menu explains \"good for mental health only!\". These fresh cut fries come topped with a very generous amount of melted cheddar cheese and apple wood smoked bacon.  The bacon cheeseburger was definitely in the top best burgers I have ever had.  It was AMAZING!! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went for the first time with my husband and two kids today. I had the salmon burger which was pretty good, I would probably come back for it again. The rest of my family had their bacon cheeseburger and said it was just average. However, my issue was the service... None of the employees appeared to want to be there. They seemed very confused between the order being placed, made, and paid for."}
{"text":"Awesome! I love that you get the option to choose even your bun. I went with the pretzel bun and it was really good. You can call this place an  American chipotle if you will. It's literally fries, burgers, and dogs Chipotle style. The service was awesome too. We had never been and it must have been written on our faces because the staff helped us with every option and price we didn't even have to look at the menu. Pair burger fresh with Mitchell's right next door and you're in the night! Will recommend to every burger lover I know. Might even give up on 5 guys. The patties are thick, juicy, and worth every penny."}
{"text":"French fries and burger fresh sauce was on point. Burgers are average at best. Be sure to specify a little bit of sauce cause they dump it on. (At least Tony does) The decor is not very cohesive and the lighting is strange. The menu isn't lit up and you have to stare at a dark wall to decipher the menu."}
{"text":"Very clean, fast , and the staff is very friendly. Great value and diverse but simple menu. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Really good and fresh! We're from out of town and never been to a Burger Fresh before. Not disappointed at all. Everything was delicious! I had the California salmon Burger on a gluten free bun and it was amazing! Place was kid approved and hangry husband approved too. I wish we had one in Toledo, will stop by next time I see one again. Fries great, not too greasy."}
{"text":"Great burgers great salmon burger.    Weak on the fries.  It is like a Sam size fries at McDonald's. They need to do what five guys does with the fries    Still great burgers and salmon burgers. Still hoping for more fries"}
{"text":"This is like a Chipotle for burgers. You order the burger (temperature cooked to order) and type of bun first and then choose your toppings as they cook the burger. All of the veggies were really fresh, and the burger was tasty. The fries were crispy, made to order, and were the shoestring type. Customer service was great. Everyone was friendly and polite. My only suggestion is to provide spicier hot pickles! Randy's Pickles is local and makes an awesome spicy pickle...just sayin'. Glad this is in Solon!"}
{"text":"Finally found the place on my second attempt - impossible to see from the road, but kind of sandwiched between Austins and Heinen's.  If you are in the area and want a great burger at a reasonable price - this is the place. Forget any of the fast food joints and my double cheddar bacon burger blew away what I had at Memories last week.  Think Five Guys for a little less $.  Fresh cut fries were crisp and the portion was correct (they only have one size).  If i have one minor complaint it would be that at \"business lunchtime\" there was only one person taking orders.  Really slowed down what would have been a very quick process - especially when I had grandma and her three 9-12yr olds \"building\" their burgers to order in front of me.  Almost late back to work..."}
{"text":"A five guys wanna be spot. I was going in thinking gourmet burger place ended up a small step up from fast food. Burger was super greasy and the shoestring fries where not impressive. For the price I would just rather go to Wendy's."}
{"text":"The best burgers yet. Fresh, tasty, and lots of bang for your buck. Ask Rani to grill your burger.  Good customer service."}
{"text":"Good burger, good fixings.   Priced a little high but if your gluten free you can't beat the bun.   Fries old school and a healthy portion.  Overall worth a stop."}
{"text":"Way better than any fast food burger you can get but not the great burger that I was looking for.  They say that the owner traveled around the country looking at the best burgers and tried to improve upon them.  I have been to some great burger places from the south to the mid-west to here in Cleveland and I am sorry to say that these don't compare.  This is a good burger and a great addition to Brecksville."}
{"text":"Not bad but I expected a lot more since Austins owns this place.   A little too greasy for my taste."}
{"text":"Most Kid -UN-friendly fast food place I've ever been to. Nowhere to sit, and even if you got a tiny table, no way to sit a child on a cheap hi-top bar stool. Watched as my food sat on the prep table as the worker walked away for several minutes, letting it get cold. Also, please tell me how it's \"Fresh\", when you have to drive home to eat it when it's cold? Burgers are the size of McD's, and also taste the same, but with 4x the price. Please, don't waste your time or money. Go to Swensons or Whitey's. This place is garbage."}
{"text":"This was hard for me to rate...  Food: our burgers tasted great. We ordered the all American and the bacon cheeseburger and one side of regular fries. We paid a little extra for the pretzel buns which were delicious and worth it. The fries were average; they tasted good, but nothing to write home about.  Service: horrible. The menu was confusing because they have template burgers and then there is a build your own burger option. However the build your own option didn't have a listed price base price. It's not clear how much it would cost so we just thought it would be easier to pick a template burger. However, before we did so, my husband told the girl behind the counter it's our first time there and asked if she could explain the options and she literally stood there and glared at him without a response. No response at all... It was silent and awkward. I mean even if you think we are morons, you can put on a smile and answer our questions. That's how customer service works.The customer right before us turned around after a few seconds and offered an answer, which wasn't entirely helpful, but at least he was nice and tried. It was bizarre; I've never been ignored and glared at for asking a menu question before. So we ordered template burgers and then she asked us what we wanted on our burgers. And glared some more when we didn't respond right away. It was strange...I purposely picked a template that has toppings chosen for me, so I wouldn't have to read off the list to her. I mean it's nice to be able to customize the burger, but why do I have to explain what I want, bit by bit, when I specifically ordered a template burger? Strange.  So did it taste good? Yes. But the combination of the weird menu and the very rude service makes me not want to go back."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for a while, but I never had a good opportunity to stop in.  Got take out last night, and I can definitely say that one of their biggest strengths is speed!  I ordered 3 burgers, a hot dog, and 3 fries, and was out the door in about 5 minutes.  I watched them make everything fresh just for my order.  The burgers and fries are both very thin cut so they cook quickly, which is nice when you've got a hungry family at home waiting for you.  I am always a fan of the \"build your own\" concept, especially when I can see the selections myself.  Having never visited before, I had been thinking of it as a \"fancy burger place, a la B-Spot or Flip Side,\" but that is definitely not accurate.  As far as speed and price ($4 for a burger) goes, we're more along the lines of Wendy's or McDonalds here.  But way more delicious.  And they have beer!  Also, the chipotle mayo is above average."}
{"text":"This place is fast-casual yummy burgers & dogs and AMAZING fries. The fries were seriously out of control good. We had the Cali Veggie burger and CLE dog which were both very good, but I would just go back for a bag of those fries. Ha. It's a cute smaller place with a few tables outside to enjoy the eats. Staff was very nice and they serve Great Lakes on tap which is cool for a fast-casual place. I don't live in the area unless I'd probably be back more often but definitely recommend if you're looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"A \"fast casual\" burger spot tucker into the corner of a strip mall right in the heart of downtown Brecksville.  Pretty simple menu...burgers (beef, salmon, black bean), fries, hot dogs, salads, shakes.  There are a plethora of toppings to choose from and they offer both pre-designed favorites and of course a make-your-own option.  My daughter and I decided to try two different burgers and share, plus and order of \"healthy fries\" and a milkshake.  The burgers chosen were the bacon cheddar burger and the 'shroom burger.  The burger patties were on the thin side, but freshly cooked right as we ordered.  Toppings were also fresh including their house-made pickles.  The brioche buns were lightly grilled to add to the flavor. Overall, I'd say the burger flavors were good, but not great.  Healthy fries were a great concept, just not executed all that well...the shredded cheese did not melt properly, so all the bacon crumbles fell off and down to the bottom of the fry tray.  And as the dish cooled it got even harder to eat.  The vanilla milkshake (on the other hand) was simple and very well executed...creamy and tasty.  I really loved the concept, but for the price charged there are plenty of other worthy choices around Cleveland."}
{"text":"Just tried to go try Burger Fresh for the first time. Shows the hours for today are 11:00 to 10:00 pm but they were closed today! Disappointed!"}
{"text":"The name is what it is.  A fresh burger.    It's similar to Chipotle set up...you basically build your order but it's a burger.  Everything is cooked in front of you, so you might have to wait for your food to cook which could potentially be a long wait if they get crowded but you don't get a fast food burger that may be pre-made and nuked.  The staff has always been professional.  This is my go to place for a local burger.  I give it 4 stars for delicious food and good experience."}
{"text":"Ive been here several times and the staff has always been great. They are terrific about waiting to make a to go meal while I eat in. And I love their fresh pretzel bun cheeseburgers! It smells and looks a little like a fast food place but it has a much better condiment/topping selection.  They have spinach and hot peppers and even a salmon burget, which i havent tried. Theyre fries are a little basic but still tasty."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian going into a place called Burger Fresh can be risky business.   Not so here, they have a great black bean based vegetarian burger!  My wife and I were super impressed because fast food can be tough for us.   The toppings were all fresh and you can pick them Chipotle style.  Loved the fresh cut fries too!  The crew working were attentive and made our food quickly.   The place was clean and neat.   Overall my first experience was a great one and I will be back.  I definitely recommend checking them out, I am guessing the carnivores out there will probably have a good experience as well.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, excellent burger. We went in around 4pm and were pleasantly surprised. Cooked to order with a nice variety of toppings. This place is a bit hard to find and the dining room is small but the food was worth it. I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"The place looked promising with a line almost out the door.  Its a tiny little itty bitty place with a few tables that have high stools.  I had the salmon cali burger, which tasted of fishy avocados. I the other in my party had the bacon cheddar and we split the fries.  She hated her burger. Halfway through, she said they forgot the bacon.  She passed me her burger and I found a tiny piece on it.  The fries were mushy, only I was able to eat them.  We both had milkshakes and those were good.  My companion would give this place a one star, but I kinda liked the milkshake.  Neither of us will be back, we'll try someplace new or go to Swensons."}
{"text":"The burgers here were cooked great and the staff was friendly. Awesome place for a quick burger and the fries were awesome too!"}
{"text":"Came here late on a Friday. Great-tasting burgers cooked to order with plenty of toppings to choose from and crispy fresh-cut skinny fries.   My burg: Single, pepper jack, medium temp, Chipotle mayo, onions, jalapeños, sweet pickles on brioche bun.  Went back and had a soggy salmon burg as takeout. Will go back and dine in next time."}
{"text":"Burgers fit the bun again. May be flatter, and same amount of meat, but it works. No fries this time. Fry quality varies. Good burger. Good brew on draft. Will be back. Beats fast food burgers. Staff knows the menu now. Don't have to tell them what I want on my All American anymore. Place is maturing nicely. Hope they can maintain."}
{"text":"So first and foremost, read a previous review on the Chicago dog.  This thing disappoints.  They toast the bread, pile it on backwards, and the whole thing falls apart.  I had lots of sads that day.  However, the burgers are good, and I especially enjoy their black bean burgers.  They are made to order and have fresh toppings.  Just know that it will take a while for it to be prepared.  The fries are natural cut and so yummy with vinegar and ketchup.    The shakes are custard I think?  They are rich and decadent.    The place itself is small, with bar height tables and seating, but there are some tables outside when it's nice.  Staff is friendly.  Read the menu before you go to get an idea of what's available.  Everyone orders the bacon cheeseburger combo the first time, in my experience.  Oh and the jalapenos are so good - get some!"}
{"text":"Ok so this place is amazing and better than 5 Guys, in my opinion. It's a create your own burger spot Chipotle style. They also have Salmon and Black Bean options. Or they would've had turkey, it would be a plus.   Staff is friendly and took the time to explain the menu to and the restaurant is clean. If you go you have to try the BFF sauce. This is definitely a hidden gem. Hopefully they'll expand and add additional locations."}
{"text":"Couldn't have been more impressed with this little joint. Absolutely astonished at how good a meal of burger and fries came out of this little office like restaurant. Luckily, it was recommended by a friend , or else I would have not gone. Don't let the curb appeal turn you away, this is a top notch burger! In my opinion, five guys-superior. Could benefit from streamlining the chipotle-like serving strategy but that will also come with more experience with their young work staff."}
{"text":"I am giving this a 4 even though I have only had the fries  - They are SO good! I am definitely a fan!!! My sister and I had the plain fries but I admit I scarfed some of my daughter's Healthy Fries.  (She does admit it made her feel much better after eating them!)  For those who may not get the inside joke their \"Healthy Fries\" are what they call their LOADED fries.  The fries are loaded in cheese and bacon, I have never seen fries loaded this well.  (Please see my pics because it was amazing. )  And the cheese is not nasty liquid cheese it is real melted cheddar cheese.  They are delicious. Granted, as Burger Fresh admits, they may only be good for your mental health, but hey! Mental heath is very important! Our order of fresh cut fries was also delicious. Not greasy and no slimy after taste like some places these days.  Our afternoon snack was a major hit and we will be back to have a full meal!  I will be sure to update my review when we do!"}
{"text":"Liked the variety of toppings, especially the sport peppers and Chicago style relish.  The arugula wasn't so fresh but their other toppings such as the lettuce and cucumbers were. I asked for a medium-done burger, although I suppose I should have said medium-rare because the burger was a bit on the well done side. However, I do prefer the simplistic burger style with a bunch of toppings that I cannot always get at other burger joints such as Five Guys. I also prefer these fries over Five Guys since Five Guys fries taste a bit chewy to me (due to their thicker size).  The fries are cheaper, making our overall meal slightly under the price we pay at Five Guys.  So although the burger itself was decent - the toppings are what may draw you here in general.  FYI - no A1, fresh jalapenos (just pickled), or curly fries.  And a shout out to the guy who made my burger who didn't shy away from all the toppings I piled on!"}
{"text":"This is a non-greasy better version of Five Guys. Love the food here! It's a bit slow moving but it's totally worth it, in my opinion. Their fries are pretty fresh too. Just wish they were a bit thicker fries but other than that, really great place! Prices are similar to Five Guys. Price is more than a typical fast food place and less than a sit-down restaurant. Overall, great place. Highly recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Place is a prime example of why you probably shouldn't leave a group of teenagers alone to run a business. Got there about seven pm. Group of five teenagers are behind the counter running the place. They were quick to take my order and make it. Food ended up coming out good. I just don't find it professional for them to bad mouth their customers. The entire time I stood there waiting on my food they basically talked about how dumb people are because they don't read or understand the menu and how \"straight forward it is\".  And they were loud enough that my fiancé sitting in the car out side the door could make out what they were saying. Just a bad way to run a business.    Update on this. One of the kids that work there tried to post a comment about this about how they only have so few people working there and that they are all under twenty. Don't understand how being short staffed has to do with being rude to your customers."}
{"text":"Walking through the front door is like the gates to heaven opening for you! Donald Glover Sr. greets you and shows you to the ordering station. Then the food comes. And it is a religious experience I'll tell you what. The burger is laced with the blood of your enemy's and it tastes like victory. The fries are fit only for Zuse himself and I'm feasting upon them questioning wether or not I am worthy of them. There are literally no words to describe this establishment. It's pretty neat."}
{"text":"My buddy said that he noticed this place the other day and he suggested it so we thought we'd give it a try. We are foodies, we love food. We entered, and immediately noticed no one was present, not one customer, nor worker. We began to look at the menu when the cooks came out of the back. We both ordered a double bacon cheeseburger with \"healthy fries\" (which are actually fries topped with bacon and mozzarella and I loved this) and a custard shake. The order is followed by them cooking it in front of you and you picking your toppings (much like a subway). The variety of toppings was mind-bottling. We proceeded to a corner table and admired the very modern and tasteful atmosphere. We then proceeded to take pictures of our food and then devoured them. Holy sweet mother of god, this burger was the tits, and that's pretty bomb. As we stuffed our faces, customers began to come in slowly, but never enough to look like a bustling casual restaurant. This place is a hidden gem and must be discovered, I hope this review reaches the masses. Plus we got free stickers so that's pretty neat."}
{"text":"Great fresh tasting fast food! I stop here often to get food to go & am never disappointed. Everything always tastes fresh down to the soft brioche bun that melts in your mouth. The fresh cut fries are perfectly cut & fried to my standard. Not too thin or thick & crispy. Cold atmosphere, seems to be a teen hangout like others have mentioned. I probably wouldn't dine in. However, I'm happy to see this place getting busier...I was a little worried when it first opened at the end of a \"strip mall\". A must try if you like burger and fry joints."}
{"text":"Burger Fresh was better than I expected! My husband scoped it out, told me it was similar to \"chipotle, but for burgers.\" Immediately and honestly, it didn't sound appealing. I thought they would be burgers sitting in a pan waiting for their fate.  Happily, that is not the case. They make each burger as-needed. You can choose from many different buns and toppings. Their burgers were simple and, for lack of better wording, FRESH. If there were one of these near us (in Indy,) I am sure they would get more of our business.  My husband LOVED their burgers, but I thought they were good, just not amazing. When it comes to choosing burgers- that's his thing. I think their fries are generously portioned and tasty too!!"}
{"text":"The food is always tasty, but the employees are kids that are more interested in smoking out back rather than taking care of the customers."}
{"text":"Was at the starbucks in the same \"shopping center\" as this restaurant in the morning for a meeting.  We had a conference call to be on and were getting hungry.  My partners recommended Burger Fresh for a quick bite as they had seen it the other day and wanted to try it.  We walked over and it is right next to Austin's Restaurant tucked away.  We were instantly greeted and told they'd be right with us to take our order.  We got a chance to stand and look at the menu.  Burgers, hot dog, black bean burgers and what I tried was the Salmon Burger.   It was YUMMY!  You get your choice of bread (white, wheat, or something else) and then they walk you down the line to allow you to pick any spreads and toppings.  They even had banana peppers!  I made mine a meal with fries and a drink.    My friends got the Salmon Burger and Black Bean Burger.  They enjoyed theirs as well.  We split my fries...they were simple but SOOOOO good!  The salmon patty was flaky and tender and everything seemed very fresh.  Great pricing for quality burgers.  $5.99 $6.99 .   Cozy little place for a quick lunch or even take out during lunchtime.  Fun friendly staff and quick service.  A few tables and stools or little bar area by the window.    Definitely try this place for a healthier and fresh alternative."}
{"text":"Burger Fresh is a great spot for locals to get a quality burger with quality toppings.  We are lucky to have them in the neighborhood.  I have no idea where they are going to put all of their customers in the wintertime, but I guess that they will figure that out when the time comes.  Also, their staff members seems to work well together and work hard to make sure the order is perfect."}
{"text":"I'm not really a burger fan, but tonight I was really craving one. This place is great. I loved my burger and the chipotle mayo is the bomb. I just might be a burger fan now. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Super burgers at this place.  Favorite place to go in town. Great ingredients and friendly staff make this top choice for burgers in the area."}
{"text":"Great concept and incredible taste. I've stopped in twice now, the options are pretty varied as to what you can get on your burger. I think the actual burger patty is a notch above five guys, and others I was with liked the fries here much better--I didn't try them. Staff was courteous, funny, and very friendly both times. Hope to see this location succeed, great economical option when I want a real burger but don't feel like going to a sit down expensive restaurant."}
{"text":"Its,ok 5,guys is better nothing stands out the workers are lazy they don't move like it's a fast food place ?"}
{"text":"So small place in and out type.  They have a nice variety of buns and toppings. To my dismay the buns on both my daughter white bun and my pretzel bun were stale and hard.  The fried had to of been made awhile ago they were sitting in warming tray.  They were sad, cold,greasy and like the end of bag pieces.  Yet the warmer behind counter full of fries. The reason giving it a three is burger portion was juicy and good.  The service was typical teen not helpful not caring just doing a job.   They did nothing wrong or good either."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I downloaded yelp just to write this review because this location has so much potential. The burgers are excellent and I love how you can add whatever toppings you like and customize your order. However, the service is atrocious. I've come here a handful of times expecting different results figuring the staff just had a bad day but the attitude and atmosphere never changed. Every time I've walked in I have never been greeted, and it appears like the staff is upset that I actually came in. I walk up to the counter and stare at the staff and no one says anything and I have to start the conversation and ask if they are ready to take my order and they just respond with \"yea, what do you want\" or sometimes I don't even get that just a nod yes. Today specifically 10/11/17 at 5:30pm was especially awful. I brought my friend in and it was his first time coming to this restaurant. Obviously never being here he was not aware of the options and when he asked about the menu she was not enthusiastic and sounded like it was a hassle explaining how to order and the options available. After leaving the restaurant my friend asked me why we went here instead of five guys or another burger spot with better service and he said he would not recommend this place to anyone due to this experience. This is why you do not leave a couple teenagers alone to run a business."}
{"text":"Burgers and hotdogs made up right before your eyes. There is a large combination  of fresh, fun toppings to choose from to dress your meal of choice. I had the black bean burger which had a nice mouth feal with the right amount of spice; I see this luring me back in the future. The atmosphere is casual and the seating ample."}
{"text":"Wish there was a 1/2 star option. Would've gone for 3 1/2.   The burger (patty) itself was overwhelmed.  Good bun (brioche), excellent toppings. It might have helped if the patty were thicker, and smaller in diameter,  mine stuck out from the bun by a decent amount.  The star of the meal was the order of \"healthy fries\". A large order of very good fries covered with about 8oz of cheddar, and plenty of bacon. Outstanding. I'd come back for those, that's for sure.  It's a small place, seating outside. Not sure how many could actually eat here in the winter, though.  They do have beer, and wine. Gives them an edge over Five Guys."}
{"text":"I specifically had a desire for a GOOD burger. I decided to get fries too. I was underwhelmed and frankly, disappointed. I couldn't find the place initially because the lights were off in the store sign. That should have been my hint"}
{"text":"I got the bacon cheddar burger. I ordered it medium and it was done perfectly. I loved all of the topping options, I got Austins BBQ sauce, hot and dill pickles, lettuce, tomato and jalapeño. The fries are like county  fair fries and great with vinegar and ketchup. I will be back."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner of a plaza and overshadowed by Austins Woodfire Grill. This place is a GEM! Imagine Five Guys. Now imagine it more refined, with fresher higher quality ingredients and more sophisticated flavor options. That's sort of what Burger Fresh is but more. Three different bun options, pretzel  brioche and whole wheat. Vegetarian options are also available, which I stay as far away as possible since I don't believe in vegetarian burgers.  This is the epitome of the quick service burger experience."}
{"text":"Burger Fresh just opened and is located at the shopping center located on Brecksville Road and Route 82 (Royalton/Chippewa).  It is across the parking lot from Heinen's next to Austin Grille.  Burger Fresh is GOOD!  They offer cooked-to-order quick meals (I don't want to call it fast food).  They do not have a huge menu, but it has enough variety to fit most needs.  While they can custom make burgers with create-your-toppings, they also have items with \"names\" to make ordering easier.  Options include tasty hamburgers made with fresh ground beef (not frozen), Salmon burgers which are terrific and my favorite, Hebrew National all-beef hot dogs, and they also offer a good Veggie Black Bean burger.  I liked the \"Cali style\" for the Salmon and black bean burgers that adds avocado chunks, spring mix, and chipotle Mayo.  They also offer nice shakes, fries, and other sides.  For a quick bite, I recommend Burger Fresh.  (I'll post photos of my Salmon Cali, `Shroom, and black bean burgers)  I've gotten to-go orders several times and have enjoyed each meal.  My only advice to the business as they go through start-up is to upgrade the exhaust system.  The restaurant is small-ish with the grill sharing virtually the same space as the dining/ordering area.  As a result, the grill/grease smell is pretty strong and lingers  after walking out.  Hopefully the exhaust fan has a high speed option and turn it up should take care of this minor issue.  I could use a Salmon Cali Burger right now!  :D"}
{"text":"Went to Burger Fresh today with 9 other co-workers during lunch rush. The staff handled the rush very well and the food was delicious. Better than 5 Guys any day of the week. Will definitely be returning. A+++"}
{"text":"Ever see an ad for a burger with leafy green lettuce, bright red tomatoes and other toppings piled high on a soft bun? The burgers here really look like that. There are a wide variety of toppings and the veggies are nice and fresh. You can either choose from a variety of pre determined combinations or create your own. There are also salmon and black bean burgers (as well as beef), shakes, and hot dogs or salad.  Burgers can be ordered medium or well done (some pink/no pink) and are pretty thin so they cook fast. We enjoyed the burger though I wouldn't say the beef flavor stood out - maybe overshadowed a bit by the toppings- but it was pretty tasty. We opted for a pretzel bun that was a nice complement.  Fries are skinny and not exceptionally crispy but with good flavor and not greasy. They also have \"healthy fries\" topped with cheese and bits of bacon. Portion size is decent for the price.  This is a quick service/ counter service place, so the closest comparison is probably five guys, though Burger Fresh seems less greasy and with fresher toppings and a wider selection of cheeses, sauces, veggies. Prices are fitting and service here is quick and friendly.  The main negative aspects is the floor- it is a bit slippery, though this could be because they just opened, and the shakes are a bit small.  A nice new quick option for lunch. I look forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The main reason I rate this restaurant 2 stars is because of the outstanding customer service. The food on the other hand was not good. I ordered an American burger with fixed toppings on it, but they still asked me what I wanted on it.   The burger was very very salty and the toppings slid off. The amount of grease was crazy and the bun was soggy. The fries were greasy and not very salty. For its price, one could get a much better burger at five guys or flip side."}
{"text":"Not impressed, overpriced, toppings didn't appear to be really fresh, lettuce was wilted, staff a stated in other reviews were quite clueless and didn't seem to want to be there. Guy in charge was standing in the corner drinking a milkshake, place was empty. Besides the 5 employees standing around doing nothing. It was clean pretty much a chipotle for burgers with about a dozen toppings. Probably won't be back, better options around. Next."}
{"text":"The unpeeled fries were great though a bit small in portion. Not overcooked. Lots of toppings that were crisp and fresh. The burger is a bit thin so if you get lots of those toppings it can tend to get lost underneath. So you might want to get the double burger. The people who waited on me were polite and very efficient. All in all it was good eating."}
{"text":"Honestly I am torn with my rating here, 2.5 - 3 stars. The food wasn't bad but the service was a meh experience.   I was craving a salmon burger so I decided to give this place a shot and try their salmon California burger. I'm trying to be healthier so I got it without a bun, but since I can't resist everything I did get fries with it. The problem though is that they only have one size for fries and one crew member laughed at me when I asked that they only fill it up halfway so I wouldn't eat it all. In general the young staff didn't come across that personable which does not leave a great impression with a first time customer. Be a little friendlier and helpful.   The food was fine, but I'm not sure if I would try this place again or just walk over to Heinen's and get a salmon burger to cook myself."}
{"text":"I have been hearing from family about this little burger place that is crammed in between Austin's and some other place (Jewelry store I think). Decided to try it out as I had a hankerin' for a burger. To start, the service staff was great, polite and fun to talk with giving suggestions of what to get. The place is small, but not tiny, enough to fit maybe 20 people in there.  The burger I got was a double, chili, chedder cheese, with onion, banana peppers  and bacon on a pretzel roll. Why I decided to make a cardiac arrest burger, I don't know, just feeling it.  I thought it was really well prepared, stayed juicy, and overall delicious. Everything mixed nicely but next time I need to just try a classic burger.  The fries, usually I shy away from in places like this but I was surprised when I devoured them. Even for the style, the shoestring style, I really enjoyed and suggest getting them. Like the other reviewer, not overly greasy, just good.  Definitely suggest going here if you got a craving, dinner time seems slow so no worries there, but I've heard lunch can be pretty hectic so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Best Burgers in Brecksville. Each Burger is freshly made to order and always cooked how I tell them to. The menue is pretty deep for a burger place and I've heard that the salmon burger is very good from my friends. Their milkshakes are also fresh and very delicious. Personally, I really enjoy the traditional All American Burger with everything. Make sure to check Burger Fresh out!"}
{"text":"I appreciate that the several times I've been there the teens working have taken the time to actually follow gluten free protocol for making our food.  There are a few of the gals who put special effort into making sure their co-workers handle all the food correctly as well and are really clearly educated in how to make sure things aren't cross-contaminated.  It's definitely appreciated that I know our food is safe to eat.  The fries btw are delicious! The GF buns leave a little to be desired, but that's pretty much gluten free buns everywhere.  At least here they toast them which makes them a little more palatable.   I'd have given five stars if these kids would just crack a smile once in a while....so serious!! I've always found them polite and doing their best to be efficient and correct with making orders, but just not overly friendly."}
{"text":"It is now two months since my initial review of Burger Fresh on Yelp back on April 13, 2018. Sad to say that I am still waiting for a reply from the store management in response to either my Yelp review or to my multiple messages sent directly to their company's website. This shows the management simply doesn't care about its procedures and/or the satisfaction of its customers. Too bad- I had enjoyed my meals at Burger Fresh prior to April 13th - but I am not going back."}
{"text":"I loved that a fresh burger place came to the area! They make it to order right in front of you, so it's as fresh as it gets! That being said it is a very small place and it can take awhile to complete your order - so just be prepared!  The burgers and fries are very good - lots of good options and condiments available! And the healthy fries - delicious & plentiful!   I know it's Burger Fresh - but I would love a chicken option! That would be tough to cook fresh tho, and take a lot of time - so I can see why they haven't provided this option."}
{"text":"It didn't really live up to my Expectations.. I think it's a fast casual burger stop.  I wouldn't recommend it for people wanting a tasty,  irresistible sandwich or even a memorable burger .  There just wasnt any wow factor in any of the bites.  I also thought the workers were a bit sloppy in presentation.  Tried it once  but won't go back.  For the price,  you can get something better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pricey, but you get what you pay for in this world. Want a great and fresh burger with whatever you want on it? Want it fairly quick and served in a brightly lit room? Fresh cut fries? Coke products? This place is great is all I'm saying. A superb burger on a bun choice. Coming back soon. Fast food burger at a sit down price? Quality product is worth it."}
{"text":"Meat eaters may not be entirely dazzled by this place because it really is just a basic burger joint, but if you're a vegetarian looking for a quick burger and fries a la your old favorite fast food joint, this is your place. The fries are \"eat out of the bag\" good and I almost recommend you do that... they get cold fast. The black bean burger is good and the service isn't slow during the day. I wish they had more unique topping offerings, but they have the basics!"}
{"text":"If you want a fast, greasy burger, Burger Fresh will do the trick.  As Kathy R stated, Burger Fresh is essentially chipotle for burgers. Get in line, choose your bun, meat and toppings, and voila, you have a burger. I ordered the standard cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and pickle, though they had other interesting options, like a veg burger and a salmon burger. My burger was A-OK, but next time, i'll order it on a different bun. The gluten-free bun was in thin crumbles when I opened my burger, so I ended up just fork and knifing it.  Side note: the fries are really delicious. You'll eat every one. They also have hilarious menu proclaimed \"Healthy Fries\" -- which are loaded fries, with a disclaimer that they are not actually healthy for you, but just healthy for your soul. Cute!  Don't know if I would ever stay here and eat (its a clear teenager hangout), but I would totally try another burger in the future! I think their speciality burgers are where its at, so I look forward to updating my review after a future visit."}
{"text":"They have good choices and very casual. It's more like self service style, but is sit down. Not bad, not great though. Burgers 2 Beer nearby is much better"}
{"text":"I had a bacon cheeseburger combo.  Many options for toppings, all good quality. The meat was above average and the pretzel bun option was nice. Liked the fries. Overall, though, it didn't stand out for me. If you're nearby and want a burger or fancy hot dog, this is a good choice. I wouldn't go out of my way for it though. Not great to eat in. Small space."}
{"text":"Great food but really awful service. The girl in line helping us was SO rude! She practically barked at us when we asked about certain toppings. An absolutely terrible attitude. We won't be back."}
{"text":"A fun establishment specializing in burgers and hotdogs. This is located in a shopping plaza across from the Mustard Seed.  When I first walked in I looked at the menu and what caught my attention was the choice of burger options. You can build your own burger or select from one of their standards. Being this was my first time here I selected an All American with the usual toppings, side of fries and pop.   This was a good burger. The ratio of bread, toppings and meat were good. Next time I will try a double. The fries were hot and tasty. I will come back here again. Try it out for the adventure of a fun burger joint.  I love options."}
{"text":"The place is small but fun.   I've been here four times and will go back for more. The crew was awesome every time.  They have Great burgers.  Cooked in front of you to order.  Add any number of toppings and condiments.  Get the fries, really good.  Prices are reasonable. Quality is awesome.   Nice little patio area too."}
{"text":"This is a very good place to grab some quick quality food. It's basically a burger spot that uses the chipotle concept. The burger reminded me of five guys but better quality and taste. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Imagine subway but take away the subs and insert burgers (they also have hotdogs)......yup that is Burger Fresh.   You can have you burger your way or choose one of there already put together menu options (although they routinely ask what you want even if you do choose one of those options).  You choose between a beef or bean pattie.  There are a few bread options, sauces and a bunch of toppings to choose from.  They make it all right there in front of you.  It is not super fast service but that is more of a refelction on the personnel than actually how long it takes to make the food.  They also offer some thin cut fries (serviceable but not amazing).  It won't be the best burger you eat but for a quick inexpensive bite to eat it is perfect.  Tip:  Try the burger fresh sauce......it's good."}
{"text":"Think Chipotle but for burgers!  This is really great lunch spot and I have gone there quite a few times with co workers.  They make all their burgers fresh to order so if there is a long line, it might take some time.  They have an all beef hot dog option, beef burger, salmon burger and veggie burger. You can also chose to make these a salad.  You then can pick a french, multi grain or pretzel bun (upcharge applies to pretzel bun).  You then can pick from a wide range of sauces, toppings and cheeses.  The variety is really great!! I always get the veggie burger and if you are into that it is really amazing! It is  a black bean based burger and I usually add guacamole, red peppers, tons of lettuce, banana peppers and a chipotle style ranch sauce that I highly recommend.  I have only tried a friends fries, but they are delicious, crispy and seasoned.  If you need a fresh, quick lunch spot in Solon then check this place out."}
{"text":"Very good, burgers comparable to 5 Guys. Cheese fries and bacon cheese fries were awesome! They put shredded cheese (no cheese sauce here) on the fries then put them under the broiler for melting.  You can pick & choose your burger toppings like you're at a Subway or Chipotle.  Milkshake was average but still tasty.  Very solid burger & shake joint, worth the stop."}
{"text":"Super fresh burger spot. Enjoyed their salmon burger and the chipotle mayo is grand.  Their milkshakes are impeccable. But most of all the customer service was amazing. Great customer service is hard to come by."}
{"text":"Extremely rude employees who continued to argue with me in front of the manager.  Order was wrong and they argued with me went I drive back to the store to get correct food!"}
{"text":"Now this was a tasty burger!! I ordered the Cheddar Bacon Burger on Wheat. Wife had the California Salmon Burger on Wheat.  Very friendly staff and food is made to order. Think of this place as a Chipotle with Burgers.  The Milkshakes are very creamy and thick. Chocolate Sjskes can make or break the experience and thede shakes were good!!  I will be come back to try more of the items on their menu!!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place.  It is a bit small with not a lot of room to wait, but it's good to see them make everything fresh.  It has a subway style of adding toppings to your burgers and boy were they delicious.  Good selection of breads, toppings, and pre-built burger and hot dog ideas for those who want someone else to do the thinking.    I'll be back when I'm in the hood."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and my burger was delish. I got the gluten-free bun and it's the best I've ever had, truly. The fries were just so-so, and I'm a fry lover. I'll go back for another burger, though; I don't need fries since the burgers are large."}
{"text":"Burger flop took to long to get food and no one was there. I ordered a milkshake it was terrible like chocolate milk my burger was over cooked and greasy so where the fries. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've tried this twice - because my first experience was great - the burger was thick, juicy, tasty and done perfectly.  The second time I tried it - NOTHING was right.....the burger was thin, small, dry and overcooked (even though I had ordered the same thing).  I don't know if it was the cook's problem or their lack of training which would establish the necessary consistency for a successful restaurant! Either way, I won't go back."}
{"text":"What I'm going to say may in part be my own fault for ordering a hot dog in a place called Burger Fresh, but -- it's on the menu, so it's fair.  I got the Chicago dog. I have high standards for these, having grown up on them, and it was their appearance in the online menu that persuaded me to drive down. Plus side: The bun had the requisite poppy seeds; the relish was appropriately neon. The menu promises the hot dog is a Vienna. And they use celery salt. All good.  The problems started with what appears to the the restaurant's process to get your food to you quickly. They stack the toppings on the bun before the meat's ready. With a burger, that's fine. But a hot dog bun's a very different matter. The mustard was squirted on first, then relish, onions, pickle slices (instead of the more authentic spear promised on the menu), tomato sections, celery salt. The hot dog -- sliced lengthwise and, I'm guessing, grilled -- perched precariously on top.  Within one bite, the thin tissue of bun connecting the two sides was giving way. Three bites in, it had ruptured completely and the relish and onions had dropped out. It didn't help that the bun seemed dry and stale. A true Chicago dog uses a steamed bun, which has more give. And, of course, it has the toppings on top.  Classically, the dog itself should be steamed, too. I would accept a char-grilled one, crusty on top, as in the hometown Gold Coast dog. But this was a flaccid, not very hot weiner.  It came with fries. My preference is for crispy on the outside, steamy and fluffy on the inside, but I can appreciate other varieties. These were thin and, to their credit, not as greasy as that sometimes means. But they didn't have much in the way of texture. I suspect their fryer needs to be set hotter.  I will give the place credit; someone came up to me when I finished and asked me how things were. I mentioned the stale bun and the inadvisability of putting toppings on the bottom, and he seemed genuinely concerned. I'm guessing they don't sell many dogs, so there's not a lot of turnover on the buns. And the place is new, so it can take time to figure things out.  Still, I won't be in a rush to get back here. In another quirk, the seating consists of just two regular tables -- commandeered before I got in by two parties of adults -- and a bevy of high-top metal tables with stools. I do not like having to perch to eat; I ain't Tweety Bird."}
{"text":"Good for fast food. Not a great burger, but good for the price and you get much better food and choices than going to a fast food chain."}
{"text":"This has become our family's \"go to\" burger place. We have three teenagers and this is one of the few fast food places we all agree on. The service is fast and friendly. The choice of toppings is fresh and tasty. Fries are outstanding. Love it!"}
{"text":"This tiny gem is tucked in a strip mall behind the Heinen's in Brecksville on SR 82.  It's kind of hard to find if you aren't familiar with the area.  They don't have a spot on the plaza sign quite yet.  When you walk in you are greeted by a small space with several tables and high stools.  The staff is friendly and polite.  They offer up burgers and hot dogs.  I ordered the All American Burger.  A double cheeseburger with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, ketchup, yellow mustard and thousand island.  They offer two choices on the preparation of the beef, some pink or none.  I decided to go with some pink.  They also offer you the choice to customize you bun, toppings, cheese, etc.  I chose to upgrade to the pretzel bun for 50 cents.  The burger is a very good sized, substantial burger.  The ingredients are fresh.  This was evident just by looking at the prep station.  The beef was flavorful even though my order of some pink ended up arriving with no pink.  I would give the burger an 8/10 when comparing to some of my favorites (double double from In-N-Out, Five Guys, Swenson's).  The fries they serve up are the shoestring type and are nice and crispy.  They weren't overly greasy.  Overall, Burger Fresh is a welcome addition to the Brecksville/Broadview Heights area, an area that was relatively devoid of a good quality, fast burger joint."}
{"text":"This is real close to the office and for that I am grateful.  I will be gracing this little hidey hole with the likes of my presence again tomorrow!  Everything was incredibly fresh, food was made fast, and instructions followed to a tee.  You get to watch it all go down in front of you.  Can you really ask for much more?  The fries were those carnival fry style, which I absolutely adore.  Fresh Cut.  See how I've said Fresh TWICE already - it's in the name - they knew what they were doing with that choice!  ;)  I love all the varieties of toppings.  I love how juicy and plump the burger was but didn't leave me with a disgusting \"I just consumed a gallon of grease\" feeling.  I cannot stress anymore how accurate this title was.  I didn't leave feeling lethargic and weighed down as I typically do after scarfing down a burger.  I would throw a 5 stars this way but there's a few burger joints which have them topped in my opinion, that also offer more interesting sides, BUT, it is still an extremely solid choice.  Even the FRESH Prince would be impressed.  We need to get Will Smith up in here, I'm tellin' ya!  Kudos BF!  Best friend.  Boy friend.  Burger Fresh.  All of these things are good, you see!"}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing. They taste great. It is made-to-order with lots of choices. This is our family's go-to burger spot. The Chicago style hot do is my husbands favorite!"}
