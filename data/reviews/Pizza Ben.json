{"text":"Great HALAL pizza shop. It is definitely a small hole in the wall kind of place, but the pizza and Poutine was yummy, the service was friendly, the prices reasonable and just sitting here for a half hour we could tell that Ben has a LOT of regular customers. 

I would definitely return next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"The pizza was very fluffy and incredibly rich. The sauce was perfectly glossed over the dough and there was the most delicious layer of cheese and assorted toppings on top - cooked until the cheese could string for miles. If you want amazing local pizza, that is everything you're craving for, come here."}
{"text":"Bad pizza-- don't recommend it! Delivery was on time, but taste is only sub par. Sauce is overly sweet, and crust had a bad taste. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Should rename this place to Pizza Ben-Laden.
Horrible quality ingredients, unsure what they use for cheese but it ain't natural. Pack a few Tums after."}
{"text":"I have a faint hunch they've got one of the best take-out pizzas I've tasted.

Normally I look for a slice that packs a thin crust, a thin and edible edge (which means more flavour in the middle) and lots of flavour from the toppings.  I will also, on purpose, get the cheapest slice on offer.

At Ben's, that will be 1.50 for a cheese pizza slice and they've never disappointed me. What's more, it's always ready: Ben aren't trying to up-sell by limiting choice at the lower end of the scale.

They do delivery and have a wide range of dishes on offer including burgers and poutine, of which I have tried neither. With the added bonus of student specials, I would say Ben hits the spot on most fronts."}
{"text":"This is literally the worst pizza I have ever had in my life. The window said $9.00 but it was 15. The \"Pepperoni\" was under the cheese and tasted like plastic. the sauce was too strong and the crust was way too mushy"}
{"text":"I still haven't found a really good and cheap place to get fast-food style pizza; I don't think Pizza Ben is the one. 

The place doesn't look very impressive, but it's really close to my place and it's dead cheap, so why not! They have a student promo that gets you a large pizza for 10$. From what I recall, there's also a 2 extra-large pizzas for 25$ promo. All pizzas are halal, and they also sell some type of subs and beef patties. I got a large, all-dressed pizza there last night, and it was pretty decent. Service was rather fast (about 15 mins waiting). The pie needed a bit more cheese, but there was a good amount of other toppings. My main complain is that the pizza wasn't greasy enough, if that makes sense. The dough was a bit thick in the middle and there wasn't enough sauce/grease - so the whole thing was a bit dry.

Still a good meal for 10$"}
{"text":"Great pizza shop! Cheese for days!

Also, I love their parody Instagram account @pizzaben is hilarious!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Cheap yummy and doughy pizza on Sherbrooke near Parc.

If you like sweet doughy pizza then Pizza Ben is a great choice. I got a chicken pizza slice, and with tax it came out to just under $3! The sweet fluffy pizza dough was coated with a slightly generous of flavorful tomato sauce followed by a generous amount of cheese. On top was chicken strips, green pepper rounds, chopped cherry tomatoes, and onion which worked really well all together. Great place for doughy pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Terrible. They try to rip you off. I just got charged $9 for an order of FRIES. Just fries and there pizza sucks anyways"}
{"text":"The food isn't spectacular, this is far from a sit-down restaurant, but the price and value make it worth 4 stars. If you're staying in a nearby hotel, heading to the plateau, and looking for something quick and cheap to eat this is your place. The service was friendly and efficient. The food was good and the prices were even better. No complaints!"}
