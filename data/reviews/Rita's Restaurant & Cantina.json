{"text":"Saw on work website so five us went for lunch today.  Place was empty at 1130 AM.  During the time we were there (about 1230) there was just us and one other table of two.  Doesn't look like much outside but inside is nice and spacious.  Looks bigger inside than outside.  For being the only ones there for a while, service was slow and she didn't come back enough to keep drinks full.  Took a long time to get checks to pay then, even though I ordered the lunch salad, she brought me the dinner salad and charged me for it.  Lunch ended up costing more than $15 for a plain grilled chicken salad with a few tomatoes, cucumbers and avacados.  They were out of all dressings but ranch and thousand island.  I pointed out on my check that I ordered the lunch salad.  She said, \"oh really, well I'm sorry\" and left.  I had to pay the full freight.  So, I got a very basic salad with no dressing and an ice tea for ove $15.  Bit pricey for lunch.  Don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Checked out the new place not far from the house. The food was good, however it was a bit overpriced considering the ambience. If this was an upscale place in a better location the pricing would be more justified.  Perhaps the higher prices offset the seafood margins. Either way if in the area check it out."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Mexican food in the valley. Every thing we ordered was fantastic. We had a cheese crisp, two taco plate, chili plate. The service was fast friendly"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate dinner at this restaurant and all I have is good things to say! The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and our waiter Jorge was the best! The food is authentic, we ordered the table guacamole and it was the best guacamole we ever had. So fresh! We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Very good food. I had a three item combo for about 11 bucks. The margs were good. The greatest flan eveh for dessert. Service was great. Nice meal for our party of 4. Highly recommended for solid Mexican food plus seafood was very fresh."}
{"text":"Six of us had an early dinner which was fantastic. The owner, Ever, introduced the entire staff who prepared meals at the table. Our only regret was that we didn't have time at Spring Training to go back. We will be back next year!!"}
{"text":"We were in this neighborhood and decided to try Ritas. Staff was friendly, service was good; salsa, drinks and food all came fast. My wife and i had el rancho parrillada for 2 and it was very good and plenty of food with great flavor. We will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food, house margy's are really decent but the Mojito was one of the best I've ever had. Service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Had a good time at the bar.  Food was spectacular with great portions.  Service was quick and friendly.  Not to mention the cute gringa behind the bar."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican joint. The food was amazing. They have these shrimp stuffed, bacon wrapped chilies that make you feel like everything is all right with the world. Top notch margaritas and salsa, too. Everything is very fresh and tastes homemade. Prices are reasonable and the service is excellent. It looks very modest on the outside but is gorgeous on the inside. Very clean, too. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Cute place, excellent customer service, refreshing margaritas, and delicious, tasty food. I ordered the Sonoran Carnitas. It came with rice and beans and your choice of corn or flour tortillas. The Carnitas were cooked perfectly and were expertly seasoned. The rice and beans were not the usual Mexican restaurant afterthought; the rice was fluffy and slightly spicy and the beans were real, not canned. It came with fresh guacamole and Pico de Gallo and both were delicious. The tortillas were homemade and soft and buttery. I highly recommend Rita's."}
{"text":"Outstanding!! the food is excellent. Very good Margarita and excellent service 5star for me. And don't judge the book by it cover a little rough on the outside but very nice on the inside"}
{"text":"Driving down University Drive in West Mesa, I found this total surprise. I'm not used to seeing anything good out there, at least not until recently. But here's this \"Now open\" sign on a building that has been empty since I moved to Arizona in 2009. So, \"something new in Mesa? Let's find out\".  I'm so very glad I did!  The interior is beautiful. There's no way it belongs out there across from the AT&T building! The food is great, the staff are very nice and helpful, and the drinks are good too.  And, I recommend you risk the five pounds gained by eating the deep fried ice cream. I'm going to have to start working out, just so I can have that once in a while!  Give them a try and learn that there can be great things in unexpected places."}
{"text":"Went to Rita's for lunch today.   Food was outstanding and service was excellent.   We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ssssh don't tell anyone. This is my new favorite restaurant. Omg the food is awesome, fresh, plentiful and affordable. The staff are wonderful and take the level of food service higher than I have seen in years. We held our daughter Graduation party there and it was a blast. They stayed open an extra hour, just for us. I challenge you to find service like that anywhere else. It's our neighborhood hangout, save me a table but you MUST have a lunch or dinner and you'll too LOVE our neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Food was really good but the wait staff is horrible and forgetful. All 4 of us had to have our drinks refilled at the same time and one drink was forgotten. Hardly ever saw the waitress and waited around for our check. I got the red snapper which was delicious and another got a green chili burrito which they said was a little salty but not bad. Unfortunately we will not be going due to the poor wait staff."}
{"text":"Decided to make a quick stop for A Michilada, was immediately greeted with warm chips and delicious salsa.  Had to try the toritos with shrimp and cream cheese... was not disappointed.  Sooo good.  Jorge the bartender was super nice.  Makes bomb michiladas and says he makes the best margaritas. might have to try that tomorrow when I stop by again for dinner this time. Small but inviting vibe, a little pricey.  Kid and family friendly.  Location isn't the best but don't let that deter from checking it out.  Better service here than Baja Joes hands down."}
{"text":"Warm welcome, clean restaurant, and delicious food.  We're so happy that we came to Rita's!  We liked it so much we bought a t-shirt - \"save water and drink margaritas\". However, I suggest being mindful of the extras e.g sour cream, lemonade instead of soda for kids meal, adds up quickly."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, only once we had a lil bad service but every time we come here is always GREAT FOOD.  Had the menudo and my daughter had a combo plate. Came out quickly and kept our drinks filled. Thx Rita's."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time this evening and we were delighted. From the outside, it looks more like a bar but we were very pleasantly surprised when we walked in! The interior is beautiful, and very clean. They have a large open dining room and an attached bar. We were greeted very warmly at the front door and taken to our table quickly. Our server was a delight, and our food came out quickly (but not so fast that we couldn't enjoy the delicious chips and trio of salsa on the table). The food was delicious! The portions were perfect! The service was wonderful... We even received a visit at our table from the owner at the end of our meal. He says they have been open for less than a year. I really wish this restaurant tons of success!"}
{"text":"This place was well worth the stop, although I was a bit nervous after passing a very nice looking Mexican restaurant up . Rita's isn't much to look at on the outside but the food was very very good and authentic. I had the Mucho Mas margarita with a splash of mango, truly delicious! Our table ordered the table side guacamole and all ingredients were very fresh, the guacamole was delicious. The shrimp fajitas, beef & chicken fajitas and taco salad ( which is made with shredded beef instead of typical hamburger meat and also has rice and beans) were all very good. The Carne Asada , I've had more flavorful Carne Asada , however, I ate every bite, wasn't too bad. All in all, everyone loved the food. The waitstaff were extremely nice and attentive and the wait was not bad at all. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Driven bye for a while and decided to give it a try. Very surprised. As it should be the service was as good as the food. Great portions. Great flavor. Great service. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Magaritas are amazing!  Ask for Jorge in the bar and ask for some of his special drinks!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical when my order of a bean and cheese burrito (with side of rice and beans) and small cheese crisp came to $20. And bummed they didn't accept the free cheese crisp offer for takeout... But I was pleasantly surprised by the serving size and taste! My 2-year-old and I devoured it. I'll definitely be back with my husband! I hope this place makes it - it's great having authentic Mexican food so close!"}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this place enough! Amazing service, good selection, the food was phenomenal. We will definitely be back. You guys are doing so great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's truly a hidden gem. If you want an authentic Mexican meal with an awesome environment come here. The staff is attentive and friendly. Also, make sure that Jorge makes you a margarita because he knows what he's doing. I had the Chile relleno and it hit the spot if you want a heavier meal."}
{"text":"I will NOT be coming here again. The service was absolutely terrible. It took us 15 minutes to get our drinks and we asked for waters right away and did not get them until halfway through our meal when we asked for them 5 times. The queso was gross, worst I've ever had. It was like melted Swiss cheese. The food was ok but nothing to come back for. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Gross food. Over priced. Two stars only because they had great service. But I've never had worse Mexican food in my life. I'm not Mexican yet I can make way better Mexican food."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are really good.  The margarita was great, you can tell it had liquor in it.   Vanesa was our waitress.  Was recommended by a friend.  Drove from New Mexico to try it"}
{"text":"We tried Rita's Restaurant and Cantina on our trip to Phoenix. Found it in a Groupon deal and honestly wasn't expecting greatness. As soon as we walked in however, we were greeted warmly and seated immediately. Our server Rosario was extremely friendly and offered great opinions on food and drinks to try. The meals were well portioned and delicious! Each of us opting for a quesadilla,  one cheese and one shredded beef. I loved the salad it came with as well.  The sopapillas were the perfect compliment to end the evening. We will certainly be returning before heading back to Denver. Thanks for the amazing service and delicious food!!"}
{"text":"This is the ONLY place we have eaten Cheese Crisps!! It's a corn tortilla with cheese that has been baked I guess is what they do, but it appears that shell was gently fried then baked.  Oh my goodness! So yum.  Especially when you add salsa and guacamole!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! The parrillada del racha had Huge portions and the food was delicious! This place isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great service. Generous drinks. Definitely a place we will be visiting again."}
{"text":"We found this to be decent food but certainly not anything special.  There were 9 of us, so between us we tried quite a variety of menu items.  We all decided it was so-so.   I'm visiting from California and used to really good Mexican food.  Haven't found anything in Arizona that compares.  My daughter's family moved here 3 years ago and they're still searching for good Mexican food.   Rita's is okay, but not anything to get excited about."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night. It looks like a beat up shack when you pull up, don't let that scare you. Food was good, not the best not the worst. Chips were fresh and the salsa had some heat to it. Bean dip was flavorfull. Had tacos and burritos and a tostada. Very good. Their menu is geared toward seafood, will try next time. Service was great. Will come back."}
{"text":"Incredible hidden gem, service was great,the food was hot, presentation was great.we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Good service. Nice servers. Food very tasty. Good salsa. 2nd time here will continue to visit."}
{"text":"The food was really good, although there were a few misunderstandings/miscommunications with the order both with my son and husbands food the items were removed from our bill by the owner so that was nice of him."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Inside decor is definitely the coolest part of this place. I enjoyed the tell check-in cheese crisp. The salsa is HOT! I like hot, so for me it was acceptable--my guests, not so much. The enchiladas are pretty small. I also ordered a carne asada taco..not good at all the meat was so fatty...i did not finish it. My guests weren't too impressed and service was pretty slow even with hardly any guests here. I feel like overall, the restaurant is okay, but I'd definitely choose other places over this."}
{"text":"Got a groupon for this place and decided to give it a try. The outside looks horrible but when we walked inside was very nice clean and new. Sat down right away. Hubby got civiche tostada and Chile Rellenos I got tamale, taco, enchilada. All the food was really good especially  the sauces. Moist and good flavor. We will be trying it again. The only reason for the 4 stars is service was lacking they were nice but something was off."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food.  Playa Bonita Parillada was so good.  I'll be back on my next trip to AZ.  Salsa was fiery good too.  Very fresh."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a great happy hour and all the servers and bartenders are fabulous. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love trying new Mexican places and I was at a loss for a new place to go so I checked what was on Groupon. So glad I bought the Groupon to Ritas! Had the jalapeño Margarita which was excellent. They also have some of the best guac I've ever had, and I get guac everywhere I go. We ordered a ceviche cocktail which was pretty good. Also got a mixed meat platter (can't recall the name right now) which was really good. I think the service was the best part though. Our server was super sweet and it had a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Checked out Rita's because I of a Groupon... EXTREMELY happy we did!  The restaurant was very clean, well laid out and had an extensive menu.  From start to finish, we were impressed! 1) Chips & salsa were some of the best we've had. Fresh, crisp chips great red and green salsas that were flavorful with just the right \"heat\".   2)  The house margarita was large and not too sweet and plenty of tequila taste and fresh lime juice!   3) The cerviche appetizer was perfect. Plenty of fresh and firm fish, shrimp, cilantro, spices and lime. Especially good for the $5.95 AND plenty to share between the two of us.  4). The entree was HUGE!! We doggie bagged half of it for tomorrow's lunch.  Overall, all I can say is, \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Loved the food and great customer service!  Came in on Saturday evening around 8.  Shrimp tacos were good with grilled veggies.  Def will be back with my two sons. Great service from Lileni !"}
{"text":"Didn't have any food so I can't give a full 5 stars but by the look of it I'm sure it would earn it! Came here for drinks before a show at club red. Friendly, quick service and great happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"We went to Ritas for the first time last night since we had a groupon.  We waited over 30 minutes to get our food. They left out the guacamole that was suppose to be included in 3 of our platters.  When we arrived we told our waitress Anna that we had a groupon that said 4 dine for $60 so we asked if that was for 4 meals or the total bill and she said the total bill yet when our check came only $55 was taken off and not the full $60."}
{"text":"This was a great cantina and restaurant. Our waiter was very friendly and really made us feel at home. Try the house special margaritas... they're great!  The steak quesadillas make an excellent appetizer. The Carne a la Tampiquena was delicious. This is definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"New band inside; extremely noisy; the owner visited with us and apologized for the volume. Sat outside and was brought a dirty glass with liquid still in the bottom.. yuck! The liquid turned out to be lime juice; let me squeeze a lime in my glass if I want it in my beer.  My Carne Asada Burrito was very good, as well as my wife's chicken enchilada. Cap'n Lefty says let this place work out the new opening growing pains as the food is quite good. I will give it another try."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for dinner tonight and wasn't disappointed! Such great Mexican food! And an amazing variety of margaritas! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Rita's is a local favorite and is always a solid place to go. They have friendly professional staff. Just enjoying a beer and appetizer Friday Night."}
{"text":"Wow, I just found this restaurant on Yelp, checked out the reviews and was immediately interested on trying the bacon wrapped peppers stuffed with Shrimp (Toritos).  All I can say is bomb.com.  It definitely met my expectations.  This location is very nice and clean on the inside with several TV's and tables to sit outside and enjoy the weather. Nice place to bring the family.  I will bringing my crew to try out the Happy Hour soon.  Thanks for the great experience."}
{"text":"I did a pickup order through Yelp and I think next time I'll dine in. My food was ready fairly quick and I enjoyed the traditional ambience while I waited. Everyone I encountered was very friendly. I saw a few posters advertising their happy hour and spotted their bar off to the side. It's not a very large establishment, but they've used the available space very efficiently without it looking cramped. I ordered ceviche and menudo. Let me start with the menudo. It was good, it came with the fixings one would expect (cilantro, lime, onion, Oregano, and red pepper), but there was nothing that made it stand out to what I could order from Filiberto's or any other taco stands along Main St in Mesa. It was also heavy on hominy and light on tripe. I think this is an item I would order again only if I were dining in, because then the atmosphere is what would set it apart from the rest. Now, onto the ceviche... My go to place in Mesa charges $5.99 and the serving is about the same amount, but this is a classic example of \"you get what you pay for.\" I believe when you dine in, it served in a large cocktail glass. To go, a styrofoam cup. In any event, I found myself sipping it and using my fork while I ate. The shrimp were good sized chunks, too. I mean, all in all it was very chunky, but very delicious. While I thoroughly enjoyed this item to go, it too would be more festive to enjoy while dining in. Bottom line is that I will definitely try Rita's again."}
{"text":"This place was the worst. Went there for the first time last night with my fiance. They sat us right away and gave us chips and salsa. Then we sat at our table for at least 15-20 minutes before anyone came over to take our drink order let alone our food order. No water no nothing. We should have left then which is what my fiance had wanted to do. I kept telling him it would be fine but it was far from fine. We finally ordered our drinks (corona light and margarita) which since they took so long we did not get happy hour prices on and our food. I had the carnitas burrito enchilada style and he had the beef tostada, As we were driving home I was already feeling nauseous and immediately took some tums hoping this would help my stomach. My fiance on the other hand got severely ill!!!! All night long he was up in the bathroom throwing up. It was the worst ever. I actually took my leftovers which I had intended to eat for lunch today and immediately threw them in the trash. I will never return to this restaurant and would caution others who eat here."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing! The nacho supreme was the best! The service is always quick and very polite. This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Stopped in on a Friday night, not busy  some tables were dirty when they could have been cleaned but they weren't thought out the whole visit. They got two things wrong in our order and when I asked for sour cream for my chimichanga they charged me $1.25 for a scoop of it. Over priced if you ask me. I was also given a hard time about paying with our Groupon."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service and the bartender Jorge is the best. His mojito is made with fresh mint grown outside  Ask for his special drinks (not on the menu). We drive a long way and it is worth it. As I said the food is homemade and excellent."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Not in the best part of town, but simply one of the best Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area. The cheese crisp was perfect. It is amazing how few restaurants can get it right. Comes with Guacamole and Pico at no extra cost. The staff was prompt, attentive and friendly. Try this place, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we were blown away!  We have lived in the area for over 25 years and there has never been a decent restaurant in this location until now. The dining room is clean and roomy. We were greeted immediately upon walking in and seated, the drink orders were taken and arrived quickly. We tried a cheese crisp as an appetizer and it arrived quickly and was garnished with guacamole and pico de gallo. Delicious. I ordered the chili rellenos and my husband ordered the pork carnitas. Both arrived in huge, piping hot plates. My rellenos were just as I liked them, an Anaheim Chili stuffed full of melted cheese. The beans were excellent and tasted fresh. My husband's carnitas were amazing. The bits of pork were tender, yet they had a chat to them that made the taste very unique. Yes, we will be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a traditional Mexican meal in a great ambiance Rita's is the place.  In Mesa and it was time for a late lunch.  Checked Yelp and Rita's had good reviews.   As others mentioned it sits by itself near University in an near empty strip mall.  It was 3:00pm and not many cars in the lot. Debated going in, saw a couple leaving and when I asked if the food was good, they both said unanimously it was The Best!  We ventured in, first thing you notice is the adorable Mexican Cantina decor, there is a nice patio great for outside dining .The place is super clean and they proudly display their \"A\" Health inspection.  Our server was Rosario, super friendly and answered many questions.  Their menu is extensive.  Best cheese crisp ever, it was truly crispy on a handmade flour tortilla.  Fajitas were sizzling and delicious.   They have a large dining room for large groups, receptions and more.  There is a nice size bar divided from the dining by cute arches.   This was truly a surprise, if you are in the area give them a try, you will enjoy their great food and leave with plenty of leftovers for another meal.  The portions are large and all is homemade including salsa and guacamole.  Give Rita's a try, you won't leave disappointed.  It is a place you would take your out of town guests for traditional wonderful Mexican food."}
{"text":"It's Saturday night,groupon helped us try  a new place, the waitress said it had been open 3 months, maybe learning curve. The picture look great, the waitress was doing her best to sell the food,the place etc. I will hope they hire out a new kitchen staff and add some flavor. I love Mexican food, my favorite of all time. The beans and rice had no real flavor. The chicken and beef tasted fresh but no real flavor. The service was slow ,took about 30 min from order to getting the food. I don't blame the waitress ,she honestly tried her best. I think this place has the potential to get better but they need to add flavor,spices,a little heat. I hope they get better, it's close by and I felt the hope in the voice of the waitress. I'll try again maybe a few months down the road."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service, awesome drinks by George the bartender!! If George is working order a Garden Cocktail or mojitos!"}
{"text":"First time here and I am a happy girl!  Food was delicious and the waiter/bartender was awesome.  Finally a great Mexican restaurant near my house!  Can't wait to come on a Sunday morning for bloody Mary's and Heuveo Rancheros!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Mexican! Service is equally as great. Chips and salsa are fresh and tasty. Our new go to Mexican place."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and I have seen so many businesses fail in this shopping center, so I wasn't expecting much out of this place but gave it a try anyway. I was quite surprised by how good the food was. It's the best Mexican food around. Everything me and my wife bought was very delicious. My fajitas were some of the best I have ever had, but my wife just got a beef burrito and it had such a good flavor, it showed that Rita's knows what they are doing."}
{"text":"Read the yelp reviews (which were great) and decide to try it. The chips and salsa were delicious, as were the flour tortillas. The margaritas are large, but not exceptional. I ordered the carne adobada and my husband the carne asada. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've ever had either. The meat was a bit fatty - such that the both of us had to spit some out - which between you and me I really hate doing. And, unfortunately the service didn't make up for it- the waitress brought food and drink and that was pretty much it. There was a guitar player who was amazing, but he charged you to play a song, so if no one was paying, he wasn't playing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Great customer service !! And great food!! I can't remember the waitress name but she was wonderful. Helped ya pick out drinks. The la pinta made with lots of pomegranate and Pom juice is soooooooo good but watch out the alcohol will sneak up on u lol. My hubby said he knew it was going to be good once he tasted the salsa lol . We will definitely be back and I'm already looking forward to it !"}
{"text":"Lupita is a great hostess, and the food is fantastic.  By far one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants in the Valley.  The seafood cocktail, the menudo, the enchiladas, and the micheladas are spot on authentic.  I come here for my menudo when I don't feel like making it at home."}
{"text":"Wifey wanted to go here last night for her simple birthday dinner.  There were 5 of us, including her 2 year old grandson.  Service again was good and so was the food.  I think everyone enjoyed their dinner and the drinks too.  Wifey said that the frozen margaritas were very good -- I had a couple of draft beers and those were nice and cold too.  This place is now becoming our \"go to\" Mexican food place.  I had the chicken fajitas dinner and that was good but next time I gotta ask for either jalapenos or seranos to be added -- it is funny that there were no hot peppers in my fajitas.  Maybe since they might think that gringos wouldn't like their meal too spicy/hot."}
{"text":"This place is a must try. The food was delicious and the drinks were amazing. Jorge was our server. He was the best. Very friendly and makes the best margaritas. I normally will not drink tequila because it tastes like gasoline to me. He challenged me to try one of his margaritas and if I didn't like it he would take it away and get something else. I didn't even think about sending the drink back. When I asked what was in it I was impressed. It wasn't the normal mix or standard alcohols put together.  They go above and beyond. He really knows his mixology and you can tell it's a passion of his. The chili verde was an explosion of flavor meat perfectly tender. The salsa was five stars. Lots of flavor with a kick. They have different kinds to try. Check this place out you will not be let down."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restaurant since 2008 and I LOVE their authentic, high-quality food. The building is nothing special and is definitely a hole in the wall, but it won't phase you when you're eating their amazing-ass food."}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos.  They were fresh and tasty. The chips were Crispy and yummy.  The salsa was good and thick.  I added lime.  They also give several options on different hot sauces.  I would not go out of my way for the fish tacos but they were good for me being in the area. I would come here again.  The price was average.  Lunch specials. $7.99 + drink+ Tip. 13.86."}
{"text":"DO NOT BUY THE GROUPON!!!!  We went in and told them a table for 5 and told them that we had a groupon.  Before she took our order, she asked us to see the groupon. Pulled it up on the phone and she said \"Oh ok. Good.\"  Then took our order. Then we get our food , Chorizo with eggs, chiliaquiles, and menudo. All not worth coming back for. It was all OK. Then we got our check and she said she couldn't take our groupon cause its not dinner yet.  WHAT?!?  we showed you our groupon?!?  Terrible customer service.  Go to Los Picos down the block for good mexican food and better customer service."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Mexican places we have found here in the Mesa area!! Service was great they even had live music!"}
{"text":"First visit to New Mexican food joint around the corner. The white cheese queso was a refreshing change. The selection of hot sauces at the table was quite varied and covered the full range of tastes. House salsa had good flavor and was not too spicy for the gringos.   Overall a good first visit. We will be back."}
{"text":"The food was very good. Large portions. The atmosphere was very nice. My son usually doesn't like fish. But loved it here. Our server, Vanessa was great. We will be back for sure. #groupon"}
{"text":"Rita's is amazing! In particular Jorge was the best waiter. He Served us the yummiest margaritas made from scratch, and the guacamole here is to die for as well. I had the chili Verde which was excellent and last time I came in I had the fajitas which were also very very good. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the food, my favorite was the Chile Relleno, my boyfriend had the combo taco with beef enchilada, he loved it. Rosario was our service and she was great! We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We have been going to the original Rita's on 35th Avenue in Phoenix for several years now and we absolutely love it. The happy hour prices and selections are awesome. The margaritas are the best. But because we live in the east valley, we only get to go there every now and then when on our way to a concert at the AK-Chin Pavilions . So when we heard about this one opening in Mesa we had to try it. Although we still prefer the Phoenix location, this one is still better than any other Mexican restaurant out there. The food is so flavorful and the service is really good. The homemade salsa is wonderful like mom used to make. Try the carne adobada and you will see that it is the best and also the carnitas are really tasty. Love the rice too. This place is now our go to for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Ughhh so much no. This place was so smokey from food when we walked in, it was hard to breathe. The lights were insanely bright, I felt like I needed to wear sunglasses the entire meal. Also, don't forget the ear buds, because the singers here sound like they're being beaten by the wait staff that's missing from your table. However, the few times I did see them, they were nice. My chimichanga came with a salad. A SALAD. With ranch. It was also soggy from all the vegetables in it.  I couldn't understand what was going on in here...and I left hungry and confused."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service! Jorge makes the best mixed drinks in Az. Found out he was a bartender in Manhatton, I'm sure he got his mix drink skills from there."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. The server is the worst I've ever had in AZ and only 3 tables seated in the entire restaurant. We could have overlooked if the food was good but it was horrible other than the salsa. The shrimp was so overlooked and dried out I had to ask for a sauce to even eat it. It was way over priced too. No appetizer 4 meals a $60 Groupon and still $20 more!"}
{"text":"The food is good.  The service is just as good.  My wife and I went in on a week night and had a combo type plate.  The chips were good and fresh.  The salsa was spicy but good.  (Beware the green salsa it isn't sweet like most places).  I had a fish taco (grilled not fried), shrimp taco and a chicken enchilada plus rice and beans.  The beans were great.  The enchilada was stuffed with well seasoned chicken and cheese.  The tacos were very good too.  Our server, Irene, was very good keeping our drinks filled.  We checked in and got a free cheese crisp.  So good!  We will return."}
{"text":"Join us New Years Eve starting at 8 for food, a DJ and dancing!! Family friendly! Party goes til the last person leaves!!"}
{"text":"Came back a second time and it was definitely not a fluke... Rita's is awesome!!! We ordered the toritos yellow chili's stuffed with shrimp and cream cheese wrapped in bacon and they were cooked to perfection!! I'm the boring person that finds one thing and stays with it so I once again chose the chili Pasilla relleno and it was delish!!!! My hubby tried the molcajete culichi \"an oversized coconut stuffed with shrimp, scallops, octopus,pico, and two oysters as well as the coconut skin that was scooped out to fill it with amazingness\" he was in heaven! Here's an example of the fresh and homemade I talked  about in my previous review they even served us the coconut water they got out of the coconut they prepared for my hubby! Rita's is the real deal folks it's our stop for Mexican food from this point on!  Thank you again thinking we will bring our kiddos and mother n law Thursday...Already can't wait"}
{"text":"Hmmm...we ate here last night! The waitress told us the margaritas were $6.00 and then our table ordered 7 and received the bill and we were charged $9.00 for each of them. Overall, the servers are good at upcharging without telling you there's an extra cost. Our fault because we should of READ the menu! For two people we ended up spending $71.00 with food and drinks! If we just ordered food without drinks it would of been cheaper. The Mexican food was all right it isn't anything spectacular like the reviews state. It's better than your typical Filibertos, Arribas, and Macayos. Now the place is located in an empty strip mall. The area looks kind of sketchy. Overall, for the amount we paid we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The best most friendly service. Great food. I love sitting at the bar and having a few margaritas."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now.  Rita's is located in a standalone building near the road (University) in a really sad shopping center.  Most of the store fronts are empty.  I daresay if you aren't here for Rita's there is no reason to come here!  The inside is fairly spacious.  Lots of tables, and a bar.  Mexican decor, and Mexican music coming out of the speakers.  Appropriate ambiance.  Kinda fun...sometimes I could hear a waitress or one of the kitchen people singing along with the music. Our waitress was a very friendly lady with a heavy accent who seemed to like me trying to use my high school Spanish.  She claimed I was doing well, or maybe she was just being nice.  :-)  The menu covers breakfast and dinner. You can order anything you want regardless of the time of day.  They quickly brought chips and salsa.  Three salsas were available.  The two red salsas were very different, one slightly hotter than the other.  I prefer green salsas with pork, and didn't really like it with the chips, but they have it if you want it.   Between our two visits we ordered albondigas, chile Colorado, a chimichanga (red beef), caldo de res, and fajitas.    The albondigas were really good and a reasonable portion for the price.    The chile Colorado was pretty good with I thought a small portion for the price.  Even with the rice and beans I think there should be a bit more of the beef in the dish.  The red beef chimi appeared to me to be a chimi with the chile Colorado beef.  If not the same beef, it was pretty similar.  It was good.  I did like it.  And the beef was tender chunks.  No rice or beans served with this one.  The caldo de res was weak.  Just not a lot of flavor.  It wasn't bad, but just not exciting or interesting.  I would not recommend this particular dish.  Lastly the fajitas.  Portion (including sliced veggies) was reasonably large.  Came out on a sizzling skillet, as they should.  Extras (like guacamole) were heaped on a separate plate.  Fajitas are a really simple dish, but they were good.  Also came with rice and beans.  The rice is pretty simple.  A basic mild Mexican rice.  Not the best I've had, but it was nice.  The beans were ordinary refried.  Absolutely nothing special about them.  Not bad, but very pedestrian.  Service was good.  She was patient, gave us time, answered questions.  She did check on us once, but otherwise I did have to flag her a time or two.  Which is fine.  The flavors were generally simple, but then that is authentic.  Real Mexican food is usually seasoned very simply, and they seldom try to burn you out with chiles/peppers.  The meats were tender with good flavor.  So the final verdict?  I'm going with four stars here.  A varied menu of choices.  Appropriate atmosphere.  Good service.  Authentic food.  Except for the caldo de res we liked all the entrees.  I think next time I will be sure to request \"all rice, no beans\" (sin frijoles).  I like some Mexican beans, but the gray-brown refried beans so many places feature just don't appeal to me.  Obviously some folks like them.  I can't see deducting an entire star for the weak caldo de res, and they otherwise definitely exceed three stars.  Can't do 3.5 stars yet.  So four it is."}
{"text":"The chicken cream cheese chile relleno was amazing!!! Margarita was delicious. You get a free cheese crisp when you check in on Yelp. To top it off the manager came over and asked how everything was and wanted to know if we would improve anything. That's the way to do business!!!! I'm going to go take a nap now. Zzzzzz"}
{"text":"Place is a must! The food was awesome seafood enchiladas were Great! Carnitas was old school Mexico! Tried the ceviche was also good. Big portions and a nice Clean place good service. Finished with a flan!"}
{"text":"Get the steak fajitas, they are amazing!  In fact, these are by far the best fajitas I have ever experienced.  They came with all the usual suspects, however they are of the highest quality.  I want to go back and try more items on the menu, but I am definetly ordering the steak fajitas next time!!!  If you like fajitas, you must try Rita's"}
{"text":"Have dessert first it's absolutely delicious the fried ice cream is the best in this area the picture I took of it went viral on Instagram"}
{"text":"definetly the joint to go to!! the Food! OMG so Goood!!!  we order the Parilla de Rancho this restaurant is family friendly&  has a section for the bar. the staff absolutley  friendly, LUPITA our server she was great, she was attentive with a great attitude..   check this place out !! ask for Lupita to be your server!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Salsa on point and a really good Bloody Mary.  Our waitress Vany was very sweet.  We will come back."}
{"text":"We came here with a groupon. Wow the food was yummy. My mom got Carne Asada and I carnitas platter. Both entres were tasty and the meat tender. Salsa was good here and spiced just right. We also got margaritas which were huge...wonder if they have happy hour. Will be back."}
{"text":"I tried Rita's for the first time last night and it was delicious!!! Really authentic Mexican food with great service and attention. Being Hispanic i am usually so picky about the Mexican restaurants I go to, but I would recommend this to anyone!  I'm going to bring my parents this weekend so they can also try Rita's parrillada. That's how legit I thought this place was lol."}
{"text":"We got steak fajita and baja california (shrimp dish) ..! They tasted perfect. The vibes are so nice.  Don't order the fried ice cream .. it is covered with moist corn flakes and did not taste good at all.  Servers were nice and fast."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and delicious.  The atmosphere is casual and down to earth and classic.  My family of four loved the entrees. The fresh tortillas are incredible."}
{"text":"New place: Food is ok. Service staff is all new so they try hard. Guacamole was really good, portion size was generous. Ceviche was a little over done but flavorful.   Our second visit was a mess...the orders were wrong and missing items and we got the food to go!   We will give them one more chance then the star ratings will go down if they haven't improved their service, and food consistency.   Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Rita's this evening. We got there around six thirty. Monday's are typically very slow for restaurants and it was super slow in there today. The service was on point. Our food came out very promptly. The hospitality of the server was pretty average, she did her job but nothing to wow about.   I did ask the bartender to change the channel to the basketball game and he told me to ask the server, ever though he ended up turning the channel for me.   I ordered the Relleno Pollo which was amazing! The chicken inside the poblano pepper was moist and tender! The chips and salsa was very good! They bring out three different kinds. I hope you like it spicy!  my wife order the combo with two enchiladas and a Taco the side portions could have been a plate it self.   My kids ordered the chicken tenders and my other child got the bean burrito but he was more concerned with coloring than eating even though he devoured his rice which was amazing by the way.   This is one of the top Mexican Food restaurants in the valley! Give it a try. I would give it 5 stars but the service was pretty average so 5 plus 3 is eight divided by two is four!"}
{"text":"Food is kinda bland but the service was excellent my hubby and I both ordered the molcajete culichi was just ok kinda bland the chips and salsa were really good tho.  Not sure if we will be back if we do will not order the same thing...overall the service was the best we had a very attentive waitress"}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent, though much pricier than you'd think. Lost a star for me because both our silverware and plates weren't properly washed, had stuff crusted on them. Eek."}
{"text":"Friday Night - Medium crowd. Great Menu selection. Service was Excellent. Cheese Crisp was spot on, and the food was especially good AND WORTH REPEATING.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"We had a groupon and went for an early lunch. This place seemed legit right off the bat. The waitress was fantastic and there was activity and delicious smells of food coming from the kitchen; a good sign. I had some kind of shrimp dish and the mrs had chicken fajitas...all was delicious! Topped off with the fried ice cream dessert that had coconut on it as well. We left stuffed and happy. It's a fiesta for the tastebuds!! 5 stars, its real Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, service outstanding and the Dr. Pepper flows like the great Falls of Niagara!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here.  The first was for happy hour and then again tonight for dinner.  I can't figure out why there aren't more people dining here as the food is very good.  The food comes out quickly and the service is great.  We came with a Groupon tonight and it was well worth it.  Hubby and I will be back."}
{"text":"This was a great restaurant.   Have driven by it many times and never stopped.  Portions were great. Shrimp tacos were fabulous.  Guacamole was very tasty. Server was very friendly.  Will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I was starting to get disappointed trying to find a nice authentic Mexican restaurant in the area.......until now!!   Where has this place been?? Oh yeah....Groupon decided to remind me.   From the outside it may look a little sketch, but once you're inside it's a totally different vibe. Service was impeccable, food was delicioso, and we will definitely be back. The one thing that really stood out for me, was the service that was provided by Jorge. They were out of Chili Pasilla Relleno which I was going to get. Prior to me ordering, Jorge brought out a sample dish of Chile Rellenos I could try. Even though it was FANTASTIC, I decided to go basic with the fajitas and Chile Colorado. They were out of this world.   I didn't save any room for Fried Ice Cream, but hopefully next time."}
{"text":"I can't understand why waiters/waitresses refuse to provide customer service. Of course I'm referring to good customer service. The waitress spent more time flirting with this one guy then serving the customer. At 1 point I spilt the salsa on the table and she literally used my napkin to clean the table. A tip is earned and not an entitlement. And the food was ok"}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Mesa. $5 Wings, $5 nachos, $5 mini chimis, $2 street tacos!!! The margaritas are delicious and they are BIG!!  $4!! and $3 drafts! Monday through Friday 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. It doesn't get any better than this! The food is amazing and the staff is fantastic. Support local!!!! ;This is a family-owned business. Check it out... You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this time at Rita's, there was a number of errors.  We asked for an item to not be included in our meals.  This was not done and a member allergic, had a mild reaction. Second, a meal was not brought to one member of our party. Their reasoning was \"They were makings other people's food.  Thirdly, there was no follow up on how the food was- like, is it ok? Are there any problems and having to wait for refills longer than necessary. Server passed by a number of times.  There were not a lot of patrons at the time we were there.  Unfortunately we will no longer prefer to go there."}
{"text":"Love this place, service is awesome:) The Chile Pasillo Relleno is the best! I order it every time."}
{"text":"Do not even get me started with this joke of a restaurant. Let me just start off by saying just because you are coming in with a Groupon does not mean you need to give mediocre service. The reason I gave you a shot was because you advertised a good deal and I paid more than my share even AFTER the Groupon value. It took two hours from start to finish for our dinner service. 1.5 hours of it was just waiting for the food because the kitchen was \"backed up\". They were pushing out other people's food that came AFTER us so how is the kitchen backed up?! Waitress (Mexican girl with the attitude) never asked us if we wanted refills on our drinks. Is it sad that our four year old had to ask for a refill on her drink? They ran out of beer so we had to get a margarita which is fine. Now here's the kicker.. our waitress came by to FINALLY take our order. Mid ordering she just leaves. No excuse me just up and walks away. She literally walked away to give someone their food an drinks and then decided 6 minutes later to come back and finish taking our order. Now I'm not sure if chips and salsa are given complimentary but we certainly did not receive it. I would not go back and highly recommend anyone who is thinking about coming NOT to either. There are plenty of other small business owned restaurants in Mesa to give business to just DO not to Rita's!"}
{"text":"This place is the spot to go to if you want really good authentic Mexican food!! Hands down the best in the valley!! Definitely going back and trying everything on the menu at least once!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here because of the reviews on yelp and we are so glad we did.  The food was fresh and delicious.  The staff was so friendly and welcoming.  Don't be put off by the exterior.  The place is spotless."}
{"text":"We were absolutely impressed. The food was fresh and delicious. Coming from a person who makes quality Mexican food. One of my favorite places now. We will definitely be back for TACO TUESDAY."}
{"text":"So far so good!  Margaritas  excellent.  Horchata  awesome!  Ceviche tostada  WOW!!!   Customer service . We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great margaritas and atmosphere.  Love Bartender Jorgee...very friendly and personable.  Second time here and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here to grab a drink and a snack. Everything was amazing!!  We had the fiesta platter. Everything was fresh, salsas are out of this world and homemade. Now the Drinks. Jorge can shake up the best margarita and the worlds greatest mojito....."}
{"text":"This place has really good food!! And the service and atmosphere is great! Ordered table side guacamole and it was delicious! Also got a chicken taco with rice and beans, it was all excellent. Overate big time haha Ya gotta come here"}
{"text":"Was the first time here, the wife wanted to try it out. Let me tell you something the flood the staff and atmosphere was all so great that I didn't want to leave.  I can't remember what we ordered but it came in this huge ceramic? Ship (i think it was a ship) with a little fire burner inside that kept the food hot. I wish my memory was better cause I can't remember our waiters name I just remember he was a N.Y. giants fan lol. Not sure if it was the owner or manager that recommended the dish we got but he was right about it, it was so good and filling we ended up taking the rest home. We will be back to try the other goodies on the menu."}
{"text":"New to this area. I've tried a few mexican restaurants in the area and wasn't to impressed, but this place Ritas deserves 10 stars. Very clean, nice set up. The food was delicious. Customer service was great. (i would know ive done customer services for 18 yrs) there drinks are also excellent. they have difinetly gain a new cuatomer not only myself but my family as well. Must try. You will be pleased. The owner is an awesome gentleman. Recommend El Patron margarita, and there  micheladas"}
{"text":"Went on the recommendation of a friend and he called it 100% correct!! Eva & Ever kicked ass!! The shrimp stuffed bacon wrapped peppers and the hand made guacamole and light crispy hot fresh chips and salsa are dead on!! That's all we had stomach real estate for but the entrees that other people were having looked awesome!! This was our first trip but it felt like going to dinner at a family members home!! I hope they prosper as they deserve to and we plan to do all we can to ensure that happens!! We definitely will be back!! Rita's For-Ever!!"}
{"text":"About 10 of us came here to have lunch before an outing. This place must have been having an off day. That or someone was new in the kitchen. Pretty much all of us ordered a chicken entree off the lunch menu. And every single one of us had bones in our food. From slivers of bone to the gross knuckle end of a chicken leg. :O It ended up being pretty comical at the end and we started making a game out of it, who had the largest and the most bones. Don't get me wrong, the flavor was great, but the bones...a big problem and choking hazard.  I bought it to the attention of the owner and he said that the wrong pot of chicken must have been used. The one for soups instead of the one for food. Unless that pot was for making stock and would have been strained, any soup made would have bones in it too. He offered to buy us drinks next time we came in. But I don't think we'll be back anytime soon, if ever.   A piece of bone in one entree is one thing. But multiple pieces of bone in every single chicken order is another and quite dangerous if you ask me."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon. It was very clean and the staff were so-so friendly. It was very spacious and they played current pop hits on the overhead. Sports were on the TVs. I ordered a water and horchata. The horchata was just ok. I also ordered the poblano relleno. The chips and salsa was good.  The relleno was good as well as the queso, rice, and beans."}
{"text":"See Jorge for the best margarita of your life! Food was amazing! Definitely will come back! Customer service was above and beyond."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and discovered this hidden gem. The staff is fantastic! They are friendly and very attentive. They remembered me when I visited for the second time. Their table side guacamole for $9.99 is amazing and a must-have for fellow guac fanatics like myself. They offer $2 margaritas on Mondays (mind blown). I love their $2 tacos for happy hour. The jalapeño margarita is exceptional. And I always get their fish and shrimp tacos with their chipotle crema sauce (to die for). I love that I live right down the street. Whether for dinner, happy hour or margarita Mondays, this place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONED!! I came here for an early lunch yesterday with my wife, it was the only meal we had all day. We both started with the chips and salsa. Ordered the Parrillada del Rancho which comes with marinated beer, pork chop and chicken breast. All on a sizzling plate. We also ordered a side of beef flautas. By the time we left, my wife and I started feeling \"chills\" . We headed to the Mesa Flea market and once we got there I started feeling exhausted. It was unusual for me but thought I didn't get enough sleep or no coffee. By late afternoon, my stomach started to cramp really badly, any movement hurt and I had to lay down for the rest of the afternoon. As soon as we got home, I threw up half a plastic bag worth of salsa, beef, chicken and porkchop. It was terrible!! I am still feeling sick today, cramps this morning and I can't eat on my vacation!!!! DONT EAT HERE!! Judging by the deserted strip mall we should have just went elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm very glad we finally stopped by. I think this will be our new regular place.   The service was prompt and friendly. Brak had beef fajitas, which he praised. I tried a couple of different  items off the a la carte menu.   I ordered two tacos (one corn shell and shredded chicken, the other flour with shrimp and peppers). Both were great. I also got a chili relleno. It was bigger than I expected, and the flavor was great.   We sat in the bar and watched the end of the Diamondbacks game on four big screens.  This would be a good place to catch a game. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The Tableside Guacamole and three salsa's they give you with the chips are delicious. They don't always give you all three but if you ask they will bring all of them."}
{"text":"Super delish.  Great happy hour. Def coming back again and again..  I don't have anything more to say."}
{"text":"Living in AZ most of my life and constant visits to Mexico, I didn't realize how good I had it. The mexican food in the Southwest is light years ahead of the food out here in the South. And Rita's is at the upper echelon of that group.   Now I live in Tennessee and have yet to find a good spot. It's true what they say, you don't know what you have until it's gone.   Now that Rita's is out of my life, I constantly crave micheladas. If you're an ASU student or a nearby resident, you have to check this spot out."}
{"text":"Food was authentic and made from scratch. Nothing canned or frozen here. Vany our waitress was great. We will definitely return for sure."}
{"text":"Rita's food is excellent! We've eaten here several times and never been disappointed! The staff are very friendly and attentive!! Support this neighborhood establishment!"}
{"text":"This place is our family's new favorite mexican food restaurant. George and Rosario are such attentive wait staff and the food was better than anything I've had in Arizona. George made us a margarita from scratch and it was amazing. We ordered the fajita trio and my 5 year old ate my meal instead of his. The chef here knows how to get amazing flavor into every aspect of the meal. Hands down best food ever!"}
{"text":"Found a deal on groupon and am I glad I found it.  Dawn  D was our server and was awesome.  Suggested the parrilloada del Rancho for 2!  Amazing.  We've been in Mesa about 1 1/2 years and finally found some amazing salsa. Definitely take the time to visit this place you won't be disappointed.  Wife loved salsa so much we took home a 32oz for later."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I've ever been too, no customer service, food is ok, but customer service is the worst I've ever experienced, stay away if you want to dine in."}
{"text":"This was a sweet deal with the Groupon I purchased. The staff was welcoming and seemed excited to have us visit for the first time. I was there with my three sons, we ordered the lengua burrito, the tamales, nachos and the fajitas for two. The portions where huge. We walked away with a To go box ( hard feat with three boys) the decor was lively and well set. Exactly what you would expect. My son loved the burrito de lengua and was silent for a full 10 minutes while he devoured his food. The tamales were so so. I am spoiled though as I lived in Mexico. And the fajitas were good."}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Food and service was great as always. You have to  try the fried icecream Great job Jorje"}
{"text":"The shredded beef in the taco salad was so tender,  I loved it.  Also try their fried ice cream with honey.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"We went on a Groupon to try a new place.  Five people went.  Only two of us were using the Groupon.  We were the only people in the restaurant and it took 1 1/2 hours.  Our service was so slow and disorganized.  The Groupon was worth $30 and instead of everything being on one bill and taking the $30 off they had to put our drinks on a separate bill.  Then, it wasn't even $30 that was taken off, it was $27 and some change and they said it was because of tax.  The manager came out and apologized and tried to give us a 20% off for the next time but there won't be a next time.  I will say the food was decent but after an experience like that we won't be back."}
{"text":"I had a disappointing experience here.  I was looking forward to coming due to some of the high reviews. The place was nearly empty when I walked in. I was given the regular menu at lunch. The prices are extremely high, especially for a restaurant connected to a strip mall in run down part of Mesa.  When I asked about the lunch menu, she said there was one, but none available. I asked if I could have the lunch steak fajitas that was advertised in the yelp reviews.  The chips and salsa were decent, but everything else seemed low quality, greasy, and not fresh.  The pico de gallo look like it was sitting for a long time .  The very small portion of guacamole also did not taste or appear fresh.  On the regular menu the sour cream was included.  When I asked for a small side, I noticed $1.75 on my bill.  I did mention this and it was taken off my bill by the manager/owner.  The waitress seemed in a rush to get my food cleared, I felt uncomfortable, and there is no reason for me to come back."}
{"text":"We tried Rita's with a groupon which is sometimes great because you try places you ordinarily wouldn't.  We were greeted by a very friendly hostess who was also our waitress. She explained to us that they had only been open for three months. I instantly thought \" ok they may be a bit slow with service\"but from pictures of the food and brief reviews I was hoping for something in the middle.  We were seated in a large empty dining room. Saturday evening and you have maybe three tables occupied is another bad sign but ok. The food took about half an hour to get to us after being ordered and honestly was not bad but not great. You expect Mexican food to be flavorful and it wasn't. The beans were bland. The taco was bland and the enchilada just not very good. Again I think they are a new restaurant and it will take some time to get up to speed but a suggestion from a foodie here, maybe change up the kitchen staff."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  So many good things in the menu that it was difficult to choose.  I had a chicken stuffed poblano on jalapeño cream sauce.  Wow.  Vanessa waited on us and the service was superb.  Don't let the shut down, ramshackle shopping center deter you. This place is clean, fresh and the margarita selection is good (no high fructose crappy mix)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place! Awesome Margaritas and the Nachos are the best. Come see Jorge in the bar!"}
{"text":"Lupita was our server she was awesome and the food was amazing great place to go The margaritas were huge and it was a nice family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great service from George at the bar. Great food, glad I stopped here. I'm from Colorado here ion business and I was looking for somewhere close to my hotel. My stuffed chili entree was delicious."}
{"text":"Best margaritas in Arizona!  Jorge the bartender was awesome!  Super friendly and he made my husband and I his specialty margaritas.  Food was delicious.  We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was actually really beautiful inside despite the empty looking lot outside. Our server was very nice and quick. The place itself was pretty slow. It was karaoke night. The portions were very well sized, the lettuce on our salad was fresh colorful and the Steak Ranchero was hot and the meat was cooked perfectly. We used Groupon so our meal was only $12 as opposed to $41. We passed some of the savings on to the server. A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I like the food quite a bit, but my order is almost never correct. When I order two chicken tacos and a beef tamale, I get three chicken tacos. I order the parrilla for 1 person, I get it for 2 (in this instance, I was using a Groupon, so I paid for their $15 mistake and took the food to go). When I ask for no beans, I get more beans than ever. I hate having food thrown away, so I usually don't complain (unless it were to taste bad), but I have once or twice and the accuracy hasn't improved.  So, 4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service. 3 stars overall."}
{"text":"What an authentic Mexican restaurant!!!! The atmosphere was great and the food spectacular.  The service was very friendly and quick. The chips and salsa are in house and fantastic.  We had a couple of combo plates and the flavor was SO DELICIOUS!  I think this will be our new \"go to\" Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrific food, clean, cute atmosphere, great staff. Vanessa was our server and was great. Everything we ordered was very good, cheese crisp, quesadilla, chile rellenos. We will come back and bring friends. One negative note, we were seated in a little side area and 2 musicians came in, guitarist and accordionist., They played and sang to a table near us, no one else, could not tell if they were friends of the customers. Way, way too loud in that small space, couldn't carry on a conversation at all."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant after finding it on restaurant.com.  AMAZING.  Yes, it's a little hole in the wall, in a somewhat sketchy part of town, but well worth it.   We had the carnitas and steak fajitas.  Both were very very good, best Mexican plates we've had in the mesa area.  This is a great place to try!  The staff was very friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Rita's offers delicious Mexican and seafood dishes and they have some great happy hour specials. Happy hour runs from 4p-7p and Jorge makes great margaritas and micheladas. It's a comfortable place to relax and unwind after a long day. Customer service is top-notch and the prices are very reasonable. They make it a point to connect with their customers and provide a great dining experience near the heart of Mesa."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been on the hunt for good Mexican food and margaritas since we moved to AZ from CA. Seriously, we have tried 6 other restaurants that have all been hugely disappointing. Finally we have found our place. To be honest, we were a little reluctant to try this place due to the outside appearance. I'm so happy that we gave it a chance. The food is so yummy and I can finally say I've found a delicious margarita in AZ!"}
{"text":"I was brought in by a Groupon. I was amazed at the authentic Mexican cuisine. I had returned for the second time today. And I was just as amazed. I got the meat platter with chicken,chorizo, pork and carne asada.  It was delicious both times! I will definitely be returning. Found my new favorite place for Mexican food"}
{"text":"Just looking for something to eat before a Spring Training game, and it was one of the more amazing customer service experiences I've ever had. The Horchata is homemade and delicious, margaritas are bomb, and everything we ate was amazing. Shrimp tacos are to die for (make sure to ask for the chipotle sauce!) all around such a great place!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a free cheese crisp, offered through Yelp, but decided to try a margarita and the menudo. Not sorry about either. The food is good. They charged me for the 'free' cheese crisp, but corrected it after I pointed it out. Will come back again, if nothing else, for the really good margaritas. I recommend, but check your bill...."}
{"text":"Amazing!   It looks questionable outside,  I'll be honest,  but it was beautiful inside,  not what you'd expect at all!   And the food was brilliant.   Fresh and delicious.   Vanessa was sweet as can be.   So accommodating for our dietary needs as well!   A must try!"}
{"text":"Food was nothing to brag about. The waitress Vani was busy on her phone had to wait for water refill and bill. She was still busy on her phone so I left the money on the table and left. They were not busy it was at 1:00 in the afternoon it was myself and a person at the bar the only customers."}
{"text":"I was a first timer who bought a Groupon for two lunches. I decided to meet a friend for lunch at Rita's. We walked into the restaurant as it was way too hot and humid to sit in their patio area. We were quickly greeted by Ever and a woman who were both very nice. We showed them our Groupon and she seated us in the bar area at a booth. The atmosphere was pleasant and we loved the decor!  Of course the two lunches we had were very tasty, and we were very impressed with the food and service. My friend ordered cheese enchiladas and the owner, Ever, who was very friendly suggested I venture out and try something new like seafood tacos, which were so yummy! One was shrimp and the other white fish with a creamy chipotle sauce. Great choice of entrees! Glad we went there and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good! Excellent drinks and the food was awesome!! Jorge was an amazing server and had great suggestions. Quite possibly the best margarita I've ever had. Definitely going to be a go to spot!"}
{"text":"tasty and authentic food and service by Rosario who has a fresh lively attitude and gave us amazing service."}
