{"text":"Uh-oh;  I don't want to praise this place too highly, it might get overrun with computer-literate yuppies, and be forced to change its core identity. So look, if you like what you read, then dress down, go for a laugh, a meal, and a beer or two or three. That's what this place is for. You'll be happy you did, and part of a happy crowd you just spent an evening with.  The Wild Rose is in the Rundle/Marlborough suburbs, and attracts a local crowd. A local crowd and me, cuz I want the BEST PIZZA IN CALGARY! Decor is sparse, suitable for efficient drinking. Comfort is sparse, but they make you feel right at home. Music is Great. Food: Generous portions of good food cooked on-site; low prices. There is always a special you want to eat.   Got a problem or a special request? No problem, the owners are right there drinking together with you. For Calgary, this is pretty close to the \"Cheers\" experience. Not chic, but fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ok, first of all Wild Rose is in Rundle...not Marlborough.   But I do agree with Mowid....definitely the best pizza, and I'm not saying that because I live down the street. They have the first and best Donair pizza I have ever had. I haven't actually been in the place since they had new owners last year (or the year before) but from what I remember it's an alright place. Like they said, local crowd, clean but for more of an \"older\" crowd. I know they used to offer Karaoke, may still do that. But if not I do remember they have really cheap daily specials and if the rest of their food is as good as their pizza then they're a really decent place."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised at the size of the joint - it's rather small, nut that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Once we sat down and waited for our drinks, we also waited for a friend to arrive. Unfortunately, once he got there we had to wait a while for the server to get his drink order. There were only four or five other there at the time, but apparently the server spent a lot of time taking orders on the phone. It appears that most of their business is delivery, which is somewhat surprising, cause with pizza that good, I'd rather have it as fresh as possible.  I had the much raved donair pizza, one friend had the vegetarian, and the other had the chef's special. All were excellent l. The crust was as close to perfect as I've ever had. The donair had mountains of meat piled on - tasty and delicious.  Service was a little slow, but once we had what we needed it wasn't really a problem.  It left us able to chat and enjoy.  It is a small place in a corner of Rundle, but there is no real reason not to go. We went for around 7:30 PM and there were no problems whatever. I think we left around 10, and it was still quite quiet and calm."}
{"text":"I'm torn. Really I am. I'm torn between the pizza for which I would've given 5 stars and the establishment. Wild Rose Pub is not the lovely brewery most Calgarians know, it's actually a little hole-in-the-wall pub in the Northeast. I yelpened (like happening upon something, but because of Yelp) upon it Sunday afternoon after finding our original lunch destination closed until later on in the day.  With only a couple of reviews, I decided to chance it. This is one of those pubs you visit when you're in search of great pizza and don't care much what the interior adds to your meal. Wild Rose Pub is certainly not the swankiest of joints. With old tables and chairs, and a questionable carpet, I found myself wondering exactly what the clientele was on a Friday or Saturday night.  Despite the decor, our server was friendly and prompt. Food and bevvies were brought out quickly, and we were well taken care. But that pizza, oh my goodness, that pizza. I ordered a donair pizza and I'm still salivating over it. The Wild Rose Special looked mighty fine tasting as well. Go check it out, your pizza tooth will thank you."}
