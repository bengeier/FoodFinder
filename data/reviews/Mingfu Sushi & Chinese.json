{"text":"We waited for 10 min. They totally ignored us. No one even acknowledged that we we're there"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.........bland.  Only good thing was the egg roll."}
{"text":"Love Ming Fu. We eat here at least 4 times a month. Great service and they are very quick when you call ahead for pick up."}
{"text":"Order chicken with cashew nuts  Only few cashews plenty of chopped salaries   I'll try something else in future"}
{"text":"Great value, excellent sushi and Chinese food!  We get the pork lo mein and the vegetable fried rice. While I could see that compared to other places Ming Fu is just OK, Ming Fu's local competition is Red Bowl in Indian Land, which sucks.  So it's 5stars compared to that."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Chinese and decided on this new restaurant for takeout. I ordered the sesame chicken with fried rice and an egg roll. The food was excellent. However, it was a bit pricey. The sesame chicken was almost $11 and didn't come with a choice of soup or salad (dine in offers that choice for same price).  I'm eager to try the sushi. Next time I'll probably try the sushi bar.  If you are interested in a higher-end Chinese restaurant in Waxhaw, I recommend Ming fu."}
{"text":"Used to go once in awhile but as time went on, increasingly filthy menus, sticky floors., greasy glasses, just everything always seemed dirty. Had bad sushi on a visit and never went back. Better sushi at the nextdoor Harris Teeter!"}
{"text":"Sushi is awful, and other dishes aren't much better.  We waited for 45 minutes past the promised time for takeout.  We've given it multiple chances but will make the drive to other restaurants to avoid eating here again."}
{"text":"Have never got an item from Ming Fu that I did not thoroughly enjoy. Me and my wife call ahead a lot. I have NEVER got home and had anything other than I ordered. The Pork Fried Dumplings are my Favorite appetizer and never disappoint. You won't go home hungry."}
{"text":"I'm trying my best not to give one star reviews anymore but this place truly needs it. Was sat and didn't see a waitress for almost 15 mins. I had to get up and tell the hostess.  I ordered sweet tea w/ extra lemon brought tea without lemon. No drink menu given when sat had to ask and they looked at me like it was an afterthought. Sake was cold but okay but cheap.  Ordered sushi for two. Ridiculous. The sashimi salmon in the plate the first thing I did was smell it, had the fish odor it's supposed to smell like nothing when it's fresh.  The rolls themselves were generic and uninteresting on par with like the NY hibachi buffet rolls. Dropped the bill and forgot about it, had to walk it up there. I wouldn't of paid a dime and caused a scene if I was alone but I was on a first date and wanted to achieve the effect of a somewhat decent human being."}
{"text":"We have ordered takeout and dined in the restaurant. Food has always been very good regardless of what we have ordered. Very nice atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Restaurant desperately needs a deep cleaning along with a new paint job! However, even though it didn't look very nice inside we were hoping that the food would at least be decent. Our fried dumplings sat in the window for awhile but were still good. I ordered the maki special with shrimp tempura roll and a shrimp avocado roll. The waitress realized she rang it in wrong but didn't offer to fix it. I barely ate any of it and instead of asking if everything was ok she just took my uneaten food with no comments or concerns! The shrimp tasted a little funny and a bit rubbery. As we left even though there were 4 workers up front not a single person said thank you, goodbye, or come see us again! Spent $30 to find out we will never return to this location"}
{"text":"Stopped by here with a friend who lives nearby.  It is in a shopping center with a Harris Teeter and a few other stores.  They have a large selection of rolls to choose from and the quality is pretty good.  I thought the value was decent.  We had 2 \"premium\" rolls, edamame, crab rangoon, a cup of wonton soup and a seaweed salad for about $35.  Can't find many places where that happens.  Environment was nice, service was friendly and responsive."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in complete take out order from last night. Would give zero stars but order was accurate. Tasteless but accurate.  Ordered Chicken and broccoli as well as beef and broccoli  BOTH may have well been called Broccoli and a few pieces of meat. Taste below average and bland. Also ordered chicken lo mein and pork lo mein for my kids. Both orders tasted like spaghetti with no taste. Flavorless was how both of my kids described it and didn't eat much of it. Some meat but mainly noodles. $33 in to the trash. If the place wasn't miles from my house I would have taken it back and asked for a refund from the confused counter staff who were struggling with Saturday evening volume. Very disappointing experience from start to finish."}
{"text":"My husband and were seated quickly however, we waited 15 minutes to get drinks and that was after we asked the hostess that seated us about our server. Finally after about 20 minutes the waitress came to the table. I ordered a vegetable roll and Mongolian beef as my entree. The roll was swimming in grease so not so good. My entree had minimal flavor and had like two pieces of mushrooms. Loaded with onions and very little beef and no spice at all. It also was greasy. I will not be returning and I'm sure the other two tables around won't either. They too sat forever waiting for service. I blame management not organized at all."}
{"text":"The sushi as very good and the atmosphere quite nice. But the service was, well, meh. Our server was nice but not terribly attentive. And when she delivered our food, before I had a chance to ask her about the various pieces of sashimi, she quickly left our table. I will go back, but not with expectations for super service.  Probably would be a good place to get food to go."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Mingfu is right down the street, so it's convenient, but after trying several dishes over the course of about five visits - both dining in and takeout - I just can't find anything to be excited about. The food is very repetitive and boring, with most leaning toward bland. Last night, I tossed my Seafood Delight dish in the garbage, as did my wife. My son was not crazy about his Shrimp and Broccoli either. For fifty-dollars worth of takeout (only three dishes - very expensive for the genre), it was a costly mistake.   We really wanted this place to work, but unfortunately last night will be our last."}
{"text":"Very good food! Service was not good. As soon as we were seated, we were asked if we were ready to order, which of course we were not because we didn't get a chance to see the menu. When we asked for more time, it took over 20 minutes for our waitress to return. Our food also took a long time to be given to us once we ordered. When we were done eating, we were sitting in our seats for over 20 minutes again wondering where our waitress was. She was a nice girl but clearly very inexperienced. Anyway, the food was still good along with a lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"We try to go back and try every couple months and we always leave saying we shouldn't go back. Chardonnay was warm, asked for a cold glass came back 10 min later and was still warm. Glass felt like it just came out of dishwasher. Kids split chicken lo mein with veggies. Hardly any vegetables.  Waitress was nice but always seemed rushed. Sushi was ok, way too much rice. Waxhaw needs another sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Got to visit Mingfu while in NC for business. The service was great. I was greeted by a hostess named Jackie. She was outgoing, friendly, and truly made me feel very welcome. Her energetic greeting made me almost feel as if I was a regular patron and not an out of town guest. The wait staff left a bit to be desired (had to ask multiple times for things like extra napkins and refills of tea). The food itself was good. Ordered some sushi. The tuna was very fresh and prepared well. Paid for the meal on the way out. Jackie gave me directions to a local market and apologized for the delays in service (she had been watching apparently). Ultimately, the food was good but it was the hostess that made the experience worth writing about. If I'm ever back in town I would stop again and try some of the Chinese food.... Remember friends, if the service is bad...you can always tip the AMAZING hostess (who kept this review at 5 stars instead of having deductions)!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in the area! I have never been disappointed and the service is always great. I usually get the spicy tuna rolls which are divine. Everything here is good and you should give it a try"}
{"text":"I have tried several different dishes here for takeout over the past several months and unfortunately all are under-welming.   Tonight was the most disappointing of all. We just flew in from a brief vacay and due to some airport delays were getting home later than expected. So we decided to grab takeout Chinese on the way home.  My S.O. loves their kung pao chicken so that's why he suggested Ming Fu.  I decided to try something different since everything I have tried previously was \"meh\". Since we didn't have a hardcopy menu,  I went online to search for their menu and found a dish I wanted to try. ( Or so I thought).  Unfortunately, when I got home, the dish looked nothing like the description on the online menu. For curiosity sake, I called the restaurant and asked for a description of the dish. That is when I learned there was a typo on the menu & they had the wrong description for Fantasy Shrimp (or chicken).  The fantasy chicken is what I ordered based on an incorrect  description. I thought it was totally gross.   It was overbreaded deep fried chicken tossed in some sort of white yucky sauce (reminded me of consistency of mayo, which I despise) over cold almost raw broccoli. It also came with a small container of sweetened walnuts on the side.    Gross!!! So if you decide to order a dish based on an online menu, be sure to ask them to describe the dish if it is something you have not previously ordered....otherwise you may be in for a disappointing suprised when you get home.    I think next time I am in the mood for takeout chinese, I will look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, both with my family and alone. The food is a bit more expensive than your typical Chinese fast-food place, but is also really fresh and  delicious. The atmosphere is upscale and more modern than other Chinese restaurants in the area. The service depends on how busy the restaurant is. I've had to wait for my check a few times, which is a huge pet peeve. I'm willing to overlook that and simply walk to the register to pay.  The waitstaff is always friendly, even when they are busy.   My favorite dishes so far are the chicken with broccoli and chicken fried rice. My husband particularly liked the beef with garlic sauce.  We also love the California tempura roll, crab rangoon and hot and sour soup.   Overall, this isn't our favorite Chinese joint, but it's nearby, affordable and delicious. Ming Fu is absolutely worth a try!"}
{"text":"My first time here. Good service, clean nice atmosphere. I had soup, salad and vegetable sushi.  It was all good, nice portions and presentation. I will return ...with friends !!"}
{"text":"great lunch at a good price. very good sushi. never seems to have any management, so service is always acceptable or better, but never great. does a huge take-out business."}
{"text":"Most poorly operated restaurant in the area.  3o minutes for one take out dish gimme a break. Not the first time, but the last!"}
{"text":"First, I can really appreciate an Asian cuisine that uses real plates and forks. Very greeter and waitresses were very attentive and cordial. She referred me to the lunch menu because of the time of day it was and made some appealing suggestions. My choice was the House Lo Mein and needles to say it was great. Filled with a nice mix of chicken, beef and shrimp and the sauce was not too thick, very tasty. This is definitely one place that is worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Lovely Asian restaurant in Waxhaw.  Greeted at the door and promptly seated.  The wait staff are very cordial and brought my drink along with some crispy noodles and sauce to snack while waiting for my food.  I ordered the egg drop soup and beef Udon.  It as delicious.  Both were very tasty and served hot.  The beef Udon serving was huge . A takeout box was needed.  I really loved the experience and food . Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered take out 30 minutes before they closed. 3 simple rolls. Found a hair that looks suspiciously like it's from the nether regions embedded in my eel & avocado roll. So disgusted I couldn't eat anything else. I would never recommend anyone eat here at any time."}
{"text":"Came here quite a bit last year and looking forward to coming again. Food was amazing and Service was just as equal. Lunch is moderately priced and dinner is a little bit more. Still worth it though."}
{"text":"Great value & service. Ultra fresh sushi (yes in Waxhaw)! Have had lots of meals here before and all are good. Portions are huge (esp my fav the Pineapple Fried Rice!), so you may want to share.  Only complaint is high ceilings & concrete floors can create a noise/conersation issue. Esp when crowded or screaming babies are in room.  Just get some hot sake & enjoy your food to forget about that! :)"}
{"text":"I've tried for years because it's so convenient. Don't do it. They will mess up your to-go order, not occasionally, every time. It just happened again.  They simply don't care. And check the sanitation score- usually around 90. Bad news for a place that serves raw fish. Just go to HT for sushi and go somewhere else for Chinese."}
{"text":"Worst service. Now granted my husband is too trusting as far as not checking orders. But when you try to get your order corrected the girls act like they are not from this planet. They don't understand what you are say or at least they claim to not understand. Management is not great as resolving issues neither. Just not going to get at this place anymore."}
{"text":"Good dependable Ming Fu.  Another dinner of experimentation and nice tastes.  We generally order something that we have not tried and have not been disappointed.  The portions are excellent and we each received a platter suitable for four people.  Certainly we took some home, but we thought how excellent Ming Fu is for a table of four or more.    Good service and really prompt.  Once you walk in the door you are escorted to a table and the service begins.  Nicely run and good food.  Astounded at how many take-out orders there were throughout the evening."}
{"text":"I can't say how luck we are to have them in Waxhaw. The sushi is much better than most restaurants I have had in Charlotte. Their food is really good and always fresh. I don't recall ever ordering anything that wasn't consistent flavorful. But again the Sushi is hands down more than just good. I love this place and service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Got some maki rolls to go yesterday, for lunch you pick 2 and get soup or salad for $9.  I went for california and shrimp and avocado.  I have tasted better from Harris Teeter.  The rice didn't taste fresh, the imitation crab meat was bright red and flavorless, the rolls were just sooo overly chewy and just not good.  I didn't bother trying to finish them, it didn't seem like it would magically get better.  As for the salad, I dipped the cucumbers in the ginger dressing and I guess that was fine, but really they can't take credit for how the cucumbers taste!  I'm hesitant to go back, but maybe I'll give the Chinese options a try next time."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Waxhaw and feared we wouldn't find a truly good Sushi restaurant.  Then we found Ming Fu - Excellent!!  All of their food is outstanding - I highly recommend you eat here or take out.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with family tonight and was really impressed. Service was fantastic and very quick! Food was great (although slightly pricy) got the sushi dinner for two and it was DELICIOUS and tons of food. Great for a date or something along those lines. Will be dining here again for sure."}
{"text":"We walked in at 8:40 p.m. they close at 9:30 pm..  the first thing the greeter did was  look at her watch and said \"we close down at 9:20 p.m.. STRIKES 1&2 at the same time!  That being said, the food was great, the service was great, the food came out hot and in a timely manner.  Except for a woman who clearly was going to miss her favorite show on Netflix at 10 p.m. it was a great experience and I probably will be back. And yes, without rushing we walked out content at 9: 20 pm."}
{"text":"Third visit and last.  Food is decent, service ALWAYS poor.  Tables were asking hostess for their checks.  We were seated for fourteen minutes, as well as four other new tables.  We never saw a server, not did any other table.  We can tolerate poor service, but we left without dining.  We will not return."}
{"text":"I have lived in Waxhaw for years and when I saw a Chinese restaurant was opening up, I was super excited. We have dine in and did take out. Never had a bad experience dining in and our orders are always correct when we take out. I love their egg drop soup and fried pork dumplings. My husband is a fan of the beef lo mein and crab rangoon. I would and have recommended Ming Fu to my friends and family"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner the other night about an hour before they closed.  First visit to Ming Fu.  I had a very simple California Roll and Moo Goo Chicken.  The food was more than amazing!  Portions were plentiful and more than filling.  They sat my dinner date and I in the main dining room but yet away from everything leaving us to really enjoy each others company.  Great Job!  However, due to the seclusion, our drink refills were very rare and uncommon, good thing I do not drink a lot.  Other than drink refills, everything was wonderful!  I really enjoyed the restaurant and will definitely be back again soon for another visit, this time to explore more of the menu!  If you are in the Waxhaw area and in the mood for Chinese or Sushi, go to Ming Fu, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Good value and food. We usually order take out but every time we pickup the place is pretty busy which is a good sign. The sushi is fresh and the chinese is good. The food in general is better than your average take out place. We have gotten the general tso chicken, chicken lo mein (plenty of veggies which we like), rainbow roll, california roll and tuna roll. Customer service is excellent as well."}
{"text":"I gave Mingfu a 3 star but just want to say that it has nothing to do with taste or service. In fact the service in my opinion was excellent. The young lady Allison was very attentive, all smiles, and great attitude. The only reason I gave it a 3 stars was that my wife's order of Unagi Don (Eel & Rice) was quite small as it only contains 5 pieces of eel. My mom's order of Shrimp & Vegetables w/ fried rice was big so my wife was able to eat some of her plate. My order of 3 roll lunch was quite small as well, even Harris Teeter's rolls were bigger. I would go back but only for lunch as the sushi and Japanese plates needs to be bigger. Hopefully that can be improved."}
{"text":"This is nice spot for pretty good Chinese. I've had both the sushi and Chinese food here and both times the food was good. Service is good the times I've been there and the prices are pretty reasonable. It's a decent quick spot if you want to grab a good bite to eat."}
{"text":"Blah!  overpriced, poor service, and mediocre Chinese food.  I was very disappointed by all the dirty tables that had not been cleaned. I get a couple tables, but it looked like they needed a bussed more than a wait staff.  Food was too expensive for what you got and I would have preferred a Chinese to go place.  Hate to be a Debbie downer, but hopefully they will get their act together.  The building is new and beautiful, but even that couldn't make up for poor service, dirty tables, overpriced food, and small portions.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Ming Fu Matthews, and Waxhaw! The food is always yummy, and not greasy like most Asian restaurants. It doesn't leave you feeling all gross and yucky. Sushi is fresh and very tasty! You gotta try to the Singapore Mei Fun. It's crazy good! We frequent this place!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant in the area. Have always gotten take out, but may stop in for a dinner one day. The service is good and staff seem knowledgeable."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Chinese food spot! We always get it as takeout... we have never dined in.   I'm especially a fan of their options that include shrimp because they give large/plump shrimp as opposed to the small to mid-sized shrimp that most Asian restaurants use for their dishes. I will say though that if you choose a meal that is a veggie/meat combo you will be given far more veggies than meat.... but I'm okay with this because I feel far less guilty about eating Chinese food."}
{"text":"The food is average at best. We had the Ming Fu special which is a meat and seafood combination in a mild brown sauce, chicken with cashews, tuna roll, salmon roll and a vegetarian roll. The sushi is over priced for the quality but then again there aren't any better options around this area of Waxhaw. The staff and server were very hospitable and attentive."}
{"text":"Moved here recently from LA. This is our go to Sushi/ chinese rsstaurant. Fresh food and goid service"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Dining room is always filthy and the staff is poorly trained. Food is OK but check the sanitation score first. I've seen it in the 80s!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, ordered orange beef for take out.  It was dry with little flavor and over-priced.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Sushi isn't that bad. Pretty good dishes to choose from. Services is friendly. Would recommend to try. Limited seating available."}
{"text":"I think Mingfu is a good option for takeout but I think their food it rather bland. Yuio can definitely get better Chinese food other places in Waxhaw. I would not recommend the broccoli and beef. The restaurant looks nice but I wouldn't want to eat in, although their prices are decent."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced food; lovely service and excellent Asian food. A little too rushed when seated but overall lovely staff."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Their General Tso lacks flavor and whoever prepares it has no passion for cooking, it is just so bland. Disappointed with the take out and the dine in experience is just pitiful. Nobody smiles and the expressions their faces make you feel like they are bothering you. God forbid you want more water because all the staff wants to do is huddle and get back on their cell phones."}
{"text":"Have ordered to go here a few times, but have never ate inside. I'll just comment on the food.  Hose special lo mien and grid rice dishes. Good food. Larger than average shrimp.  Good portions and packaged well.  Chicken terriaki skewers tasty and fresh. Moist and not dry. Some of the best I've tasted.  Soups, wonton gives more wontons than most and is flavorful.  Egg drop tastes better than other places, has more egg white pieces  does not 'gel' up when refrigerated. Reheats well.  Egg rolls: frozen and reheated! Don't taste fresh made. Does anyone make fresh egg rolls anymore??  Will continue to order take out from here happy with overall experience."}
{"text":"I have been to Mingfu a few times. The sushi is very expensive (for what it is) and if you drive twenty minutes to Pineville there are (much better) places that have all you can eat buffets. If you plan on eating more than one roll of sushi you might as well go to a buffet. The food seems very inauthentic and is not great. Their takeout, however, is good and I like it much better."}
{"text":"Ok food, but nothing exceptional. I ordered hot and sour soup without meat and it wasn't spicy enough."}
