{"text":"There is a lot of great options to choose from here. I love the sushi. The sushi is made fresh everyday. There is an international section, American section, and a pizza section along with a salad bar."}
{"text":"Great variety offered! i understand the need for wiser eating but all the no sugar, no gluten all baked vending or hot foods is a bit overboard. But there is a great salad bar & pizza shop"}
{"text":"Really gross.  Most open tables were dirty- and there at a lot of tables. It is a hospital after all.  Sullen workers make it worse.  It so turned my stomach that I just threw away my dinner uneaten.  Downright depressing!!"}
{"text":"The food is gross. The grill is awful. People are gross and talk inappropriately around customers while they flirt with other staff. We ordered breakfast this morning and they handed us the wrong order. We made it back to my son's room to discover it was wrong. Took it back and they acted like it was our fault we got the wrong order. They had our correct eggs sitting there and gave those to us. . They were cold and they would not make us another. The tables are filthy, the cashiers are rude and unfriendly. The salad is over priced and had a funky after taste. We've essentially lived here for the last four months and I'd rather not eat at all than go down there. I brought my son good up from them one day and there was a nice black hair in there. Disgusting. My son is going through chemo, and there are so many germs we carry in our hair the good ended up in the trash. Avoid them. Everything down there is dirty."}
{"text":"Pretty gross, got upstairs to the waiting room and there was a hair in my food. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best.  AVOID THE BURGERS at the cafeteria.  One of the worst burgers that I have had in my 60 years on this earth.  There are some food options.  Moes Southwest Grill and Subway.  They also had a great salad bar."}
{"text":"This place is horrible you can't even get a soda with caffeine. I do understand the fact it's a hospital but the food is inexcusable at best."}
{"text":"Don't understand why the cafeteria needs reviews. Just a typical hospital cafeteria. Just hearing \"cafeteria\", I don't expect much. Food is okay, decent. I guess there are plenty of choices, a lot of healthy options. Probably you should never go here if you're looking for good food. If you work here or have to be here while visiting someone in the hospital, you can get by on the cafeteria food."}
{"text":"Well, I wouldn't have expected much from the cafeteria of a hospital but this place was wonderful. It is by far the best option for mealtime at the Cleveland Clinic. They had a wide variety of different types of food to choose from and it was all freshly prepared and reasonably priced. I mostly utilized the salad bar. It had many different types of greens (not just boring lettuce) and a lot of other fresh veggies, and a good selection of toppings and dressings. I loved the fact that they had dried fruit and sunflower seeds and gorgonzola cheese. Also, the grilled chicken was really grilled and not poached but it was also not dried out. And they had olive oil and both balsamic and red wine vinegar. And you pay by weight so that is a fair way to do it. I probably could eat from that salad bar for days and not get bored."}
