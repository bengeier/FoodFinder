{"text":"Yum! The cheesecake is to die for. I feel like it tastes better when cold but some people may disagree. Better come in the morning to skip the wait"}
{"text":"There was no wait! The cheesecake was amazing as expected! Service was quick and precise. All the staff seemed to know what they had to do. Probably the best Japanese cheesecake I've ever had."}
{"text":"Semi-new location opened uptown at Pacific Mall, where Uncle Tetsu is located at the right side of the mall's main doors. This shop is almost as small as the downtown location but interestingly, people tend to line up in a loop within the store instead of outside.  We went mid-afternoon on a weekend and only had to wait about 10 minutes. We bought one original flavoured Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecake ($10 no tax) and a box of four Honey Madeleine ($6.64 plus tax) to snack on. Just admiring the store, I was amazed by the batch process and how efficiently they can bake cakes quick enough to satisfy customers within a confined area.  For payment, they have dedicated machines that would take your cash and automatically spit out the change. Same with debit card purchases which can be done through their advanced cashier system.  The cheesecake was amazingly good - just like every time! It's softness every bite would melt on your tongue slowly yet its never too sweet. Similarly, the madeleines were nicely made into moist cupcake-like molds. We were surprised their madeleines were so big, unlike the usual flat ones. My overall experience with this Uncle Tetsu was great. The only comment / suggestion I have is to make sure those cheesecakes are cooled down before serving into boxes because we've noticed our cheesecake was a bit too moist and the paper stuck onto the cake's surface."}
{"text":"This was the first Uncle Tetsu location I visited when it was still quite new. This is like an express location, meaning it only has the signature cheesecake and tarts.  The staff were very friendly and greeted us when we came in. We ordered the cheesecake and got the order immediately. Very fast and efficient service, granted there was no line at the time and it was raining a bit (which might have driven people away). For the cheesecake itself, it was sort of...lackluster? It really didn't live up to the hype for me, as it tasted more like cake than cheesecake. The texture was quite fluffy and wasn't too sweet, but it didn't have enough of a cheese taste for it to really feel like a cheesecake. I tried a similar Japanese style cheesecake in a random small bakery in Waterloo, called O'My Bakery, a few weeks later that I would say is actually a bit better than Uncle Tetsu's."}
{"text":"Not too long of a wait, they accept cash and cards. Cash is to be put through a machine. They run out of their ingredients a lot, and don't have as much of a wide variety of selections from other Uncle Tetsu stores."}
{"text":"No queues here on a Wednesday afternoon. I was having lunch nearby, so I popped in to purchase a regular cheesecake. The cheesecakes here are nice but not spectacular enough for me to make a specific trip here. The parking situation is really bad and I'd never come on a weekend.  One thing I don't understand about Uncle Tetsu stores is the bad customer layouts. They hardly leave any room for customers and the till is always in the wrong place.  They really don't care about customer experience.  I wouldn't know where to go if there was a long queue, then there's no space to wait for your order.  There's enough space for around 10 people to stand, if that, and they infamously make you wait for your cakes, after you order them. They have a machine that takes bills and gives you change too."}
{"text":"This is a review for their Honey Madelines and Rusk.  Madelines - box of 4 costs $6.64 ($1.66 each). Good size, moist, nice and just a little sweet. I wish it has more flavor. Could really use more sweetness. But over-all good.  Rusk - pack costs $3.54. These are actually very sweet, nice and slightly crunchy texture.  These goods smell good! Heavenly!  Came in after 7pm on a Monday, and there were only like 4 customers including us. Not busy during weekday evenings.  Of course, I would come back. No entrance from inside the mall, entrance is from the outside of the mall."}

{"text":"May 10, 2018 - I really don't like cheesecake!! BUT Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecake is very good! It light, fluffy and yummy"}
{"text":"Great cheesecake.  I brought the cake in the afternoon and didn't eat it until late evening.   It was moist, soft, and fluffy."}
{"text":"Long line, but worth the wait for those fluffy Cheesecakes! They only have the basics right now, but cheese tarts should be selling by the end of this month."}
{"text":"This is as light as a feather ... just barely sweet (which I love), luscious, delicate and refined taste which melts on your tongue -- you are transported to sheer Paradise.  Subtle background flavour of cheese, just the perfect amount of everything ... and fresh ... just a cloud of pure deliciousness without over-sweetening, which is a common North American habit.  Oh man ...  My last food item on earth ... let it be this ...  Oh ...  My  Good Lord."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I waited for about an hour for this so talked about cheesecake. I waited outside the pacific mall in the cold waiting to just get a small taste of what everyone was raving about. Let me tell you, it was well worth the wait. The cheesecake is so soft and delicious! I absolutely loved it! Hated the wait, but the cheesecake and their rusk cookies were truly amazing. I love to bake, but honestly it takes years and amazing talent to master something so perfect. I was thoroughly impressed and could not wait to go back! During our next visit to Toronto, we stopped in when there was no line! It was about 3pm on Saturday on a long holiday weekend. The quality was still just as good and i enjoyed it just as much as i did the first time. The cheesecake is warm when you receive it in your hands. I highly recommend eating it as soon as you can! So delicious!"}
{"text":"Cheesecake sponge cake??? Hai!!! Looooong line ups HAI!!  Went to get me laptop repaired came back with 2 tetsus finest  These sell like ..... hot cakes... Was worth the 35 min wait not a second more than that"}
{"text":"I just bought the Madeleine, no taste at all. It's just an ordinary bake flour and sugar. I am soo disappointed. My muffin cake taste better than theirs.  Never buy here anymore."}
{"text":"I love Uncle Tetsu cheesecake! Had my first one in Taiwan at the night market and was so happy that we have it in Toronto. I was not able to try this cheesecake for awhile. When it was first introduced there were lineups for hours! The one at union station at the York concourse is  now pretty quiet. This one that recently opened at Pacific Mall is still crazy busy. There's line ups every time I go however the service is fast so the longest I wait time was 15 mins which is not that bad. I love the cheesecake so nice and fluffy. I've also tried the tart and the honey cupcakes which taste like pound cake. Not worth the $3 per cupcake. I would rather stick with the $10 cheesecake no tax! Every time I go to Pacific Mall I will be getting me one of these cheesecake! Yum!"}
{"text":"This new Uncle Tetsu's just opened on the ground floor of the Pacific Mall. It's actually located on the ground floor of Pacific Mall with the entrance at the outside of the mall. Came here during dinner time and the line was about 20 minutes long. From the line outside, you can smell their cheesecakes!  They have the Honey Madaleines, Rusks, and the classic cheesecakes. The cheesecake was exactly $10 (no tax) which makes it a really good deal considering how delicious they were. Love their cheesecakes due to the fact that they're always fresh, soft, and moist. I will most definitely return back for more whenever I visit Pacific Mall."}
{"text":"Another Uncle Tetsu's location just opened in Markham! This is at Pacific Mall right next to the South entrance.  No lines and no one waiting.   Smallish just for take out.   The staff here is nice and fast.   Just have the more basic selection: Cheese cake and Honey Madelines."}
{"text":"I came on a Monday afternoon but the line was quite long and it took an hour to get my cheesecake. The reason it took so long is because they serve the cheesecake fresh. I saw them took the cake out of the oven and put another batch in to bake. So at least you know the cake is fresh and is not sitting there for a while.  I got the Japanese cheesecake and I think it tasted alright. It wasn't as giggly as I expected and the flavor was a bit plain. The cheesecake flavor was not super cheesey but I think it was still worth a try. The price is very reasonable, $10 for one cake. I don't think I'll come back but I would definitely want to try it in Japan and see how it compares."}
{"text":"Honestly, to this day, I think it's just really marketing, I have no idea why there was a lineup all the time for this place. Mind you, the cake was okay but I can find a similar cheesecake at a lot of places, cheaper and no lineups."}
