{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars.   Food was TERRIBLE. I ordered from here as I had to spend a very long time at Scarb-Grace, so out of desperation I did eat the food. I'm not going to say they gave me food poisoning, but I was definitely not feeling very well after eating that food.   It tasted awful and the service was awful - I would be terrified to see their kitchen. OH! And asking for hot sauce led the woman to hand me one packet of chili sauce and when I asked if I could have another (I did order 3 full dishes) she told me I had to pay 25 cents for a packet.   Would never go here again and would never suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"If you live on kennedy, birchmount or finch. You gotta check this restaurant out, I've been going to this restaurant for the past 4 years. Majority of the food I've tried taste just as good as congee wong and congee queen. They have a lot of choices for noodles, rice, congee, soup and stir fry.   Take out is also very fast, usually i wait less than 10 mins for multiple container of food! But make sure you don't buy the drink in their little fridge because those drinks have been sitting there for a long time.  Overall, I am a loyal customer of this restaurant and always will be as I'm living!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! It's good Chinese home-cooking that just tastes great. Prices are super cheap and some of the lunch specials include soup and rice. The service is like all Chinese type restaurants (not super friendly, but gets the job done). I love it here!! Shhh don't tell a lot of ppl cuz the place is also VERY small."}
{"text":"Close to the Scarborough hospital. Stopped by because i was super hungry. The plaza looked sketchy, old and dead.  The decor is out dated and old school Chinese restaurant. Ordered the lunch special : Noodles with beef and vegetables with  black bean sauce. It was tasty and they used the crunchy  noodles. Also ordered their special congee that had seafood, chicken and beef. It was good. Ignore the decor of it being dingy the food is just okay and cheap."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. When I'm in need of a quick fix for some greasy Chinese, this is the place I hit up. They have standard dishes,  but they are slightly greasy relative to other places. For the price though you can't go wrong. You'll need to drink lots of water or tea with it as I think they're a bit heavy handed in the MSG department,  but thay may be my own personal experience. As I said, you get what you pay for and it's a good quick fix for some Chinese food."}
{"text":"Its probably is the best food you can get in the little plaza. The service was great, probably because there weren't many people. We ordered the individual lunches but it turned into more family style because the soup came in a big bowl and the dishes were separate from the rice. I liked it. We had a tofu dish, fried pork chop, and sliced beef. The food was at a decent price and had was about the same as most Chinese places. If I'm ever in the area, I would consider coming back."}
{"text":"Not in the most pleasant of plazas but at least you're nearby Scarb-Grace Hospital. Both interior and exterior look like... Well like Chinese restaurants on DT Baldwin. My supreme picky Cantonese eating Friend told me about PK as Family-owned. I could definitely see it as the Woman crack jokes with the Cook inside. When the Cook had downtime, he came out to watch the Fairchild TVB show. On that old and small(by today's standards) CRT Television.  Makes sense.  I hope you can read Traditional Chinese.  That's mostly what's on the Menus. You can  hear the Wok-ing happen as it's semi-open Kitchen as it states. They do have some interesting picks and House Specialties. Even have Curry Crab, Herbal Chicken, etc etc...  We went for the $17+ 3-dish choice selection.  Reasonbly priced. Comp Soup came to start.  Orange Slice came to end. Dishes took awhile to come but when it did it came in a burst. Amazingly steaming s t e a ming HOT every dish that came out.   Black-Bean Bittermelon and Beef Slice --- Good flavour and definitely less sauce than others. Beef has more bite than the other over-corn-starched soften ones. Bittermelon slightly undercooked.  Fortunate for them that's how I like mine. \"Gum Xiang\" is the best description for what Cantonese prefer.  Deep-Fried Fish in Corn-Egg Sauce --- Obviously Fish isn't the fresh variety. Not absolutely crispy coating but at least it's FRESH oil. Egg Drop Cream-Corn Soup Sauce isn't glue-y. Means less corn-starch thickening agent used, nice.  Bean Curd Stick, Tofu w/Beef Brisket in Hot Pot --- Least favourite of the bunch.  My fault as I was too cheap to get Lamb. Lots of Tofu and Bean Curd Sticks very filling indeed. The Beef Brisket and Sauce is the variety from Noodle Soups. The Beef mostly fell to shreds and doesn't have the Fat/Lean ratio to be amazing.  I consider PK Open Kitchen as a very good Food Court (Wor Cai)type that has made it to it's very own location and offers affordable small dishes(Xiao Cai).  It's far from being a popular \"Regular\" spot for most as it's not in the best of locations but for someone like myself, it's definitely worth a re-visit to try out their House Specialties."}
{"text":"Definitely A-OK. I mean, lunch specials. At $4.99 each for a very good selection of stir-fried or braised noodles/rices, each portion being enough to feed two average eaters, I'd say this is probably one of the cheaper eats I know of. They also have a number of entrees served with soup and rice for $5.99, also lunch specials.  Had: (we ordered everything with less oil) Yeung Chow fried rice - oddly enough, no peas. Other than that, it tasted pretty good. Probably because of the smaller amount of oil, the color was slightly off, but that's understandable. House stir-fried vermicelli - the onions were a tad large, and I would have preferred them slightly more cooked. There was also an interesting pickled vegetable (I want to say a pickle, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't a standard cucumber pickle) in there. Other than that, not bad at all, and I've had much worse at double the price.  Nice perk is that for anyone going to Scarborough Grace Hospital (Birchmount campus), this is like five minutes walking distance away. Hurray for that!  (Closed on Tuesdays)"}
{"text":"If there were 0 stars I would definitely give that!!!!  Extremely small restaurant that has 2 entrances which is made the place consistently cold because of the doors opening from both sides.  Service is terrible, only the owner serving and doing take out orders.  All tables except for us got a free daily soup as starter and some fruits (oranges) as dessert. I am definitely sure it wasn't any kind of combo because we ask and she said there's no more but tables after us got.  Food is JUST average, any other restaurant can do better. Reason we went to eat because it was the closest to the hospital and we were limited to our choices so we decided to try it out.  Never refilled our tea and when we asked she totally forgot about it then it never got refilled. We realized they forgot one of the dishes we ordered when we were finished our meal, we asked her and she told us kitchen is cooking it already. When she turned around to ask the kitchen, I heard that she was JUST putting in the order so we decide to cancel. Then she gave us the worse service ever! Giving us grumpy and mad faces!  When we asked for the bill, she just gently threw the bill on the table and walked away not caring.   I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE GOING!  If you want Chinese food, there's one 1min walk away from it in the same plaza."}
{"text":"i did not like this one bit.  below par food quality.  terrible service by the owner, no waiting staff.  lunch specials are ok.  nothing fancy.  i would avoid this place at all cost and you should rather go the sri lankan take out joint a few doors down the road at the same plaza."}
{"text":"Lunch Specials Wokking Hot at Paul Kee Open Kitchen!  23 Selections to choose from at $4.99 each, making decisions can quite hard. Everything looks tasty!  Open kitchen means you can hear and smell and watch the cook preparing your meals. Definitely can increase your appetite, I am hungry!!  Service is really casual. The strip mall is a little sketchy. The deco dated.  Maybe that's what make Paul Kee a great neighbourhood's hole in the wall Chinese eatery!  Lunch Specials till 4 pm."}
