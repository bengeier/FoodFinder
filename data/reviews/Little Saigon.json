{"text":"My wife and I ate here because it kept coming up on our yelp apps. It was delicious!! Cathy, the owner's daughter was our waitress, and she set an excellent tone to the experience. Very vivacious, helpful , super friendly, and very quick, attentive service. I ordered a noodle salad with beef and shrimp, topped with their fish sauce. So good. My wife had the #37, a pork chop with shrimp, steamed rice topped with a fried egg, and an egg roll. She enjoyed it also. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"*DISCLAIMER* Awful and unapologetic service! Though many reviews offered high marks for this restaurant's food, in my book, the thing that sets the tone of the restaurant is its service. When we (3) first entered the restaurant, no one greeted us and there was a party of 10 and 2 in front us. Many people showed up after us, so it seemed that the restaurant was popular. After 25 minutes, the party of 2 left while the party before us waited an hour before they were seated. And yet even after they had just been seated, a party member had to grab the menus themselves from the front because of the lack of service. If a restaurant receives as many high reviews, then high quality service has to be accompanied with it. I don't care if the food supposedly tastes good. If the servers don't even apologize, let alone acknowledge you, why bother?"}
{"text":"I only tried the pho with tofu and it was delicious. The tofu wasnt very tasty thiu but the broth and vegetables made up for it. Will be back and order it with just vegetables next time. Only$8."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in the area hands down!!! Pork spring rolls and potstickers were delicious!!! Fantastic, attentive service!! Amazing salad bowls!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I updated to five stars as it is really a good one. I tried other phos, and found this one is very clean, and the food is delicious. The only wish I have is hope it will also open on Monday!   Every time if I do not feel like cooking and need a light dinner, I go there!"}
{"text":"Tried the #22 Mi Quang (egg noodle soup) and the #34 bun tom bo nurong (rice vermicelli salad bowl). The #34 was the bomb! Fresh and clean tasting, not heavy at all. The #22 just wasn't my thing, not to say it wouldn't be great for someone else. With so much on the menu we will be back to try everything."}
{"text":"The food here is just great. The pho and eggrolls are the best I have tasted. The only problem is the service. I've had one of the young guys twice already, and he has chosen other people before myself and family. Maybe he's bias, but how is he going to take the order of some else who was there after us. When we told him we were there first he, he still brought their good first. I'm sorry I'm not white, but this discrimination is ridiculous. Trust me we are not difficult people and we tip really well."}
{"text":"I was in Glendale briefly and my friend who lives there took me here for some good ol' Asian food. It was a great pick since I hadn't been eating anything substantial all day. I only managed to get one dish, of course, but would be willing to try out more if I go back!  Those of you familiar with Com Tam entrees will know what this common restaurant dish is that I ordered. It was charbroiled pork with egg cake, pickled vegetables, broken Jasmine rice, and shredded pork. This also came with a bowl of Vietnamese fish sauce which I prompted doused my rice in because I love broken rice mixed with that sauce. The pork itself was delectable though a little tough to cut. They had sliced it up into attached strips, however, so that was easier than having to cut it all up myself. The vegetables were great but not as crisp as I would've liked. My complaint with the dish was the egg cake, which was too hard and condensed. It made me wonder if it had been sitting around for a little bit because of its texture. I only managed two bites of it before I called it quits. As for my drink, I had a Thai tea that I had asked for without boba but the waiter still put it in there...and it wasn't great at all. The Thai tea itself was delicious but the boba was disgusting. I avoided it by drinking from the top. My friends ordered pho so if I ever went back there again, I think I'd try that next."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place and finally made it for lunch today - Wow - Awesome! We had the egg rolls and Pho Ga - Excellent - everything was fresh and tasted amazing ;-) Everyone was really nice and welcoming... I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We visit during the lunch hour and a absolutely love any and everything they make, the veggies are nice and fresh and always crunchy."}
{"text":"Food was good but service wasn't too great. I was there when there were barely any customers so there was no excuse. The waiter didn't seem like he cared and rude in my opinion."}
{"text":"They have the best pho here. Initially I was a little uncertain as I had loved the pho in Chicago, but This little place is great! They also have really good spring rolls and rice."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in AZ! I'm so in love with this place that I plan on coming here for years to come....yummy!"}
{"text":"after reading the reviews on here, decided to give it a try....  Started off with the spring rolls and then got the combo fried rice(w pork, beef, chicken and shrimp), gotta say I was very impress with all the flavors that came out those dishes, added a little spice and everything was nice.  The service was good, very attentive and will help you out with their expansive menu.  Gonna visit again soon."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in Glendale on a Sunday afternoon looking for food, you don't have a lot of options.  That said, Little Saigon is a great place to stop by.  Located in a converted old home it has a certain charm and is a pleasant place to relax and enjoy a meal.  We had the beef Pho and a Chicken and Shrimp salad and both were very good.  Portions are generous.    The staff was friendly and took care of all our needs.  I would definitely go back when in the area."}
{"text":"I come for the beef Pho and potstickers! I've come here like 15 times to eat and while I want to try some new things, I just crave their beef Pho and potstickers all the time so I always order that. Pho broth is full of flavor, ingredients are fresh, and meat is tender. The potstickers are just amazing and the dipping sauce is perfect. It's very reasonably priced, the food is great, and staff is always friendly. Not to mention, siracha, chili, and hoisen is on the table so you aren't limited to just a little! The restaurant is really small, very casual, but very cute."}
{"text":"Love it here I am totally adicteeeddd to PHO I like eating  here and after walk around downtown Glendale ..the part that I like more is the ambience family own and is like a little secret"}
{"text":"So my family and I had this place for the first time about a week ago. Really good, the Pot-stickers are out of this world bursting with flavor and a must try with the sauce. We ordered one order of spring rolls.....we ate them so fast we had to order more. Very tasty I can't wait to try this place again. Service was also great and met all expectations. Side note save room for shaved ice."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this location after reading all the fabulous reviews...but the food and service was subpar. Not to mention the Mr.'s stomach did not favor the curry :( sadly won't be returning. Really wanted to like it, but just couldn't! Still on the hunt for good, authentic Vietnamese!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The food is very fresh and they give you a lot of really fresh veggies. The grilled chicken with vermicelli type of noodles are delicious it has all kinds of tasty seasonings!!! its seriously like the best thing in the world!!!! its that good!!!. Their pho is good too!  they give you a good portion of fresh veggies and seasonings like fresh cut mint leaves and such, its awesomee!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this locally owned restaurant.  The service has always every single time been excellent and friendly.  The rice flour crepes are spectacular, the chicken pho soup is a must.  We eat there at least once a month.  And any other dish we have gotten has been very flavorful and yummy.  We call in for take out and the food is still perfect and delicious after the drive home.  Lots of veggies to go with the rice flour crepe and the pho soup.  It's one of our favorites and consistently never disappoints us."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend and decided to give it a try. Service was fast and friendly.  Food was great and the price was very reasonable.  100% satisfied and I would definitely recommend you to try it too."}
{"text":"Been searching for a decent pho place in Richmond hill for a while with no avail and finally found this tucked away place in the T&T plaza. Pho was great, nice Herby flavour with no beefiness and the durian smoothie was very good! Thick and didn't cheap out on the durian. The spring rolls were nice and crunchy too."}
{"text":"I miss good Vietnamese food and after being offered some unappetizing food at a conference nearby this was a welcomed sight! I drank the Boba Thai Iced Tea, Shrimp summer rolls, and curry. It was a party in my mouth! It felt like home! I cannot wait until it gets cooler to try their Pho! Drooling just thinking about returning!"}
{"text":"One of the best Pho spots I've been to here in Phoenix! Potstickers were on point as well!!"}
{"text":"Had the fried rice, spring rolls, and crispy stirred fried flat rice noodle.  I wouldn't say this place is a 4.5 stars but food were decent and fast.  Good service.  Price ranges from 7 to $10 for the entres."}
{"text":"Legit Vietnamese food. My husband is a culinary student and we go to a lot of Vietnamese restaurants because it is his favorite genre of food. This is authentic food that is simply delicious. Cute little place in downtown Glendale so feel free to do some antique shopping on foot when you are done."}
{"text":"Has been awhile since I have had This Amazing PHO Tia , and today it was so perfect welcomed in with a smile and made me feel like I was welcomed , my food was amazing and enjoyed it very much ! Love this place always a relaxing and beautiful place to come and eat ! Thank you !"}
{"text":"I have frequented this restaurant for over 20 years (incl. past locations).  The food is the best in the area and surpasses that I've had in the many cities I've visited.   Every friend I send to this restaurant go back; I recommend you try it too.   Soup is great, so is the lemongrass chicken, seasoned flank steak, and salads. Top off you meal with a tasty iced coffee--but not too late in the day if caffeine keeps you awake!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff if you go on the days when the owners are present.  Wish they had consistency in their food/service, but when someone other than the owners are running the joint, watch out for missing soup parts (shrimp, fish balls, etc.)   Their lemongrass soups are WONDERFUL!  And you don't want to miss their hot pots.  Yummy"}
{"text":"On a daughter's recommendation I had my first meal at this hidden gem in downtown Glendale.  The wait staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Our server spoke perfect English and was very knowledgeable about the menu. The menu is huge (about 100 items- you order by number) so it can be a little confusing understanding the differences between even just the soup cboices! In the end we all ordered soups and they were very large portions but chock full of noodles and meat and a good size plate of veggies to toss in. It was a lot of food! And very good! It's a small restaurant but we didn't feel crowded at all and enjoyed our view at the window. The only down side for me was that I'm pretty sensitive to different foods etc and I got pretty bloated later in the day. I'm gonna guess it was the salt in the soup. Next time I think I'll try one of the rice plates. ..they also looked yummy."}
{"text":"Came today just cause I needed to go to the T&T. I didn't have high expectations as I was here probably about 5 years ago and remembered it was crap. Little did I know its a NEW pho place that replaced the last crappy pho place. I am so glad we came!!! Was here with my family and it was FANTASTIC PHO!!! Not overly salty, with strong broth flavour. Usually we get dehydrated after with all the MSG from other pho places but not here. We tried standard pho and chicken pho. Both were incredible!!!  The only complaint I have is that they take cash only. Its also more expensive than your average pho place so we were definitely short on cash. Medium bowl about $8 and large $9. The place was packed with about 4 groups of people waiting. They definitely need to expand. I cant wait to come back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I've been to Little Saigon twice. Both times, my friends and I have got the exact same thing. Loads of spring rolls and the pho tai. The rolls are excellent, as other reviewers have noted. But for me, the highlight was the pho. The broth is so, so good. It can't but make you feel happy when you take a big slurp. Add some extra jalapenos on there, some sprouts and sauce and mmm...I need to stop writing this review. Making me hungry just thinking about it.  TIP: try the soda chanh mui (salted limeade with soda water) with the pho."}
{"text":"Super good.  Very authentic viet food..pho, spring roll,  vermicelli ..the whole menu is delicious. I eat every weekend before grocery shopping at T&T next door."}
{"text":"Such a quaint and delicious restaurant! Everything we ordered was amazing- pho, fried catfish, veggie springs rolls and thai boba iced tea were amazing! Plenty of dish options for vegetarians like myself. But of course I had to get pho and the broth for the vegetarian pho was so flavorful! Hubby and I will definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Their hours were posted as closing at 3:00 pm.  We got there at 2:40 and were refused entry, with the host saying that they stop seating people at 2:30.  If that's the case, why don't they post closing hours as 2:30?  My family use to run a restaurant and our customers and business were important to us.  If someone came 5 or 10 or more minutes after our posted closing, we would still welcome them.  In this economy, the majority of restaurants we have gone to have gone out of their way to provide good service.  I guess this place doesn't need or value the business.  I'm giving them 1 star only because someone recommended this place but I will not be returning to see what we missed.  There are plenty of excellent Vietnamese restaurants in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"this was a pleasant little discovery we made. we'll be going back for sure! the ambiance was that of a busy place, food was great, (if you knew what to order) service wasn't too annoying like the other oriental places."}
{"text":"What do I dream about when I'm back in NYC? I'll tell you: the supremely delicious banh khot that's made to perfection at Little Saigon. I've never had anything like it in my life, and I only wish I didn't have to wait for summer vacation to enjoy it again.  I've loved this Little Saigon for years: it's a charming place, the people are fantastic, and yes, there are many other things on the menu that are superb. But the banh knot has captured my heart!"}
{"text":"Here for the 1st time Surprised by the excellent quality of all the food!  Had: 2 Deep Fried Spring Rolls 1 Cold Shrimp Rolls 2 #355 Pho Satay Noodle Soup with Shrimp ... was not sure whether the women's washroom was accessible, for my wife in a wheelchair, but the men's was not."}
{"text":"This is hands-down my favorite restaurant in Glendale. Very cute, family-run restaurant in downtown Glendale. They have the best Vietnamese spring rolls--roast pork, shrimp, vermicelli, cilantro wrapped in delicate rice paper and dipped into a peanut sauce.   The pho is great--Asian comfort food. Catfish is also good. Just had the seafood won ton noodle soup last night and didn't like the wontons, but the broth was very nice and light.   Very reasonable prices and friendly service. I take all of the friends I like to this place."}
{"text":"If i could give half stars it'd be 3.5 stars. A good clean place to eat.  The soup base for the pho was good and didn't taste like it was overloaded with msg or was leftover from the day before.  I got the pho with rare beef and the meat was nice and lean and thinly sliced. overall I had a good experience but I wouldn't say it was extraordinary but it's one of the better pho places in the area."}
{"text":"This place does their food really well. Probably one of the best tasting and most authentic Vietnamese food in the area. Cash only & no takeout orders though."}
{"text":"Me and my date wanted to try a new restaurant and decided on Little Saigon... The appetizer was yummy, we had the vegetarian spring rolls. We ordered our food.. and the first couple of bites were good, but then I noticed a giant cockroach crawling down the wall behind my date! Needless to say we didn't finish..."}
{"text":"Awesome vermicelli and homemade potstickers! The vietnamese ice coffe delish and strong:) Tried their porkchop rice plate and their flashfried shrimp all very yummy!And prices very reasonable :-)"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Richmond hill. Such a cute little spot. Lunch time on a Saturday it get really busy, but worth the wait. It's always clean and the food is always on point !  The owner is always so nice and always checking to see if we need anything else ."}
{"text":"Super service, yummy food - you have to save room for the fried bananas...wow!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years and I enjoy it every-time. The food is fresh and delicious and service is fast."}
{"text":"Really great pho, I highly recommend the rare beef variety. The pad thai was very bland but the kids liked it. Any of the pork based menu items are really delicious, especially the spring roll and the vermicelli noodles."}
{"text":"I am very familiar with Thai food, being part Thai and all. Vietnamese food on the other hand is a different adventure for me. Yes I have had it a few times, but what I had was nothing to write home about. I saw the reviews of Little Saigon on yelp, and persuaded my husband on a very hot 115 degree day to try it with me.  We are fans! We started out with the spring rolls. Not the deep fried kind but the fresh rolled kind, it had vermicelli stuffed with shrimp, herbs and grilled sliced pork. These are some of the best around. Most places just use the unflavored sliced pork, this was actually sliced,marinated and grilled. Made a huge difference in the taste. The only way it could be improved, would be the addition of some mint. The peanut sauce that it came with was good, different from the Thai peanut sauce I am used to but good. We ordered the regular iced tea. It was clear and refreshing. I usually order the salted plum or salted lemonade drinks whenever I have Vietnamese cuisine, but did not want anything with salt as it was so hot outside. I ordered the #38, it came with 3 grilled shrimp,a thin cut of grilled marinated pork tenderloin, white rice and an over medium egg on top. It had a few pieces of lettuce,daikon,carrot,cucumber, and tomato on the side served with a mini fried eggroll with minced pork inside.  They brought out the sweetened fish sauce to go with it  and I was happy with my selection. The pork was tender with a minimal amount of fat around the edges, and the shrimp was butterflied. The eggroll was not greasy and it was crisp. Overall I would order it again, but want to try something different next time around. My husband got the #56. Pork short ribs that fell off the bone, and shrimp served in a clay bowl floating in  a delectable peppery brown broth, with carmelized onions, and a garnish of green onions on top. Served with white rice on the side.The ribs tasted a bit like re heated meat, but the sauce/broth made up for it. The prices and portion size are just right. I would rather pay for good quality than quantity of food that other places dish out.  It is a bit hard to find. There are no big signs that stand off the road, we actually passed it then turned around. The setting is in what used to be an older home. They have a nice patio that I can see spending some great nights with friends outside in the early spring.  Inside, there are a few different rooms. Maybe a few tables in each room. The main room has tables to fit a larger crowd. We ended up in a smaller room to ourselves. I think it's a great place to bring a date without breaking your wallet. The place was very clean. Even the restrooms. That's a key right there. If the restrooms are dirty at a restaurant, guess how the kitchen must be?  We will come back to this place and I see it as becoming one of our favorites. The service was friendly and I would rather give my hard earned money to a family owned and operated restaurant than a chain any day! This would be a great place to start off dinner before going to the Glendale art walks or Glendale Glitters! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I admit it. I'm a romantic. Sometimes I give my heart away too easily to a handsome french fry here, or a buff egg roll there, only to have it broken on our second meeting. The french fry has gone limp, the egg roll greasy. That's why I forced myself to hold back after going to Little Saigon the first time. I had to see how I'd feel on our next date. Now I'm ready.  The place is really cute. It's in one of the little houses that make up much of downtown Glendale's shopping district. You'd expect to be served Irish stew or corned beef and cabbage here. There are lace curtains in the windows and potted fake plants scattered about. But the food is Vietnamese, and lots of it, too. You can order by number, or enjoy feeling foolish trying to pronounce the Vietnamese names of the dishes correctly - all one hundred and one of them. So far we've tried eight.  The dish that first delighted us was #62, bo cuon la nho ($9.99), This, of course, is marinated beef wrapped in grape leaves and served with rice noodles and \"paper\". It comes, as do many of the dishes, with a large helping of fresh-as-can-be romaine lettuce leaves, mint, thai basil, coriander, and sliced carrots and cucumbers. It it looks like you're going to run out of greens, the pleasant servers (none of them Vietnamese) happily bring you more. The beef is tender and flavorful, contrasting nicely with the brininess and chew of the grape leaves. On our second visit,  Ken ordered #55, black peppered bite-size pork ribs with caramelized onions ($6.99). It was served in a pot which came boiling to the table. The broth was delectable, flavored by the onions, and the ribs were falling off the bone with just the right jolt of pepper.  I decided to order two appetizers - egg rolls ($4.99) and banh xeo ($7.99), which are rice flour crepes filled with pork, shrimp and bean sprouts. The egg rolls were good, but not noteworthy. The crepes were delicious. I've had them at other places and they usually arrive at the table soggy from the filling. These were perfectly dry and crisp, despite the load of meat and veggies. Our friend Sue, who was with us on our first visit and happily came on the second, had the fried rice bowl ($6.99) both times, so we plied her with our goodies. I bet the next time she'll go with the ribs.  There are 10 variations of Pho, with rice noodles, and 5 more soups made with egg noodles. Then there are 6 hot pot soups. Many dishes are served over rice, and others with stir fry noodles. Catfish is done 4 ways and shrimp 3. There are 3 green mussel salads and 5 mixed salads including one with jellyfish. I could go on, but if you go on line, you can see the menu for yourself.  As I mentioned above, the servers are friendly and attentive. They actually remembered our names and what we had eaten on our first visit. We had directed other friends to Little Saigon that night, and the servers remembered them, too. The portions are large, the ingredients fresh. And there's even a cute patio. I think I'm ready to commit."}
{"text":"By far the best Vietnamese restaurant In Phoenix. We ordered the fried  vegetarian egg roll. Omg is all I can say. The pho soup is the best and very addictive so expect to go back for more.  My daughter in law got the pork chops and rice. Her favorite.  All ingredients are fresh and colorful and the presentation of your order shows they take pride in what they are preparing. The service is second to no one. They are all very attentive and appreciate you being there. I would recommend if you haven't tried it then you need to. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"One of these days, I'll be adventurous and try the amazingly beautiful plates of food that I can't pronounce. I'll actually dig into the piles of leafiness and rice noodle wraps that look like lacey doilies. But I wasn't adventurous tonight. I know I adore curry so I went with the chicken curry with carrots, potatoes and onions. My taste buds were very happy with me! It was more than I should have eaten but I ate it all anyway - yum!  Great service. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is getting more & more busy ... line up now to be seated! No secret why...their Phi is so authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Cute little place in town, well worth it.  We are very picky when it comes to restaurants and we were quite pleased with this experience.    Definitely a 'locals' hidden gem and not touristy...we are from Vancouver, Canada and we like to find locals secrets :)"}
{"text":"We eat here almost every other week.  The soups are out of this world.  Anything you order here is going to be awesome.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place as it's nice and cozy restaurant with great tasty food. Service is great as well. Will definitely recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"We went to Little Saigon a few months ago, with the expectation that this is gonna be one of the few places with great Vietnamese food we can fall back on when we crave it due to all the great reviews on Yelp. However, just like another one in Cave Creek, it blew away my expectations, and not in a good way. I dunno what it is, but maybe since I'm Asian and I go to Vietnamese restaurants you can give us crap food and crap service? Hell, I don't even care about the service, all I really care about is the food.  Service - ok. barely. nobody bothered to refill our drinks, even though we were right outside the kitchen, with NOBODY else there dining at the time. The girl took forever to come take our order, messed up our order, and had trouble with the credit card machine afterwards as well. Damn. If you were new (don't know for sure) at least let us know what to expect.  Food: We ordered spring rolls, chicken pho, cold noodles, and the infamous #55 spare ribs that many people raved about via quick tips at the time.  Spring rolls: Ok, but the peanut sauce tasted like...well...let's just say water would've had more flavor. How can you mess up peanut sauce?  Pho: not bad, but nothing great to write home about.  Cold noodles: see above   infamous #55 spare ribs: Well, I don't really know. When we got this thing in a clay pot, we opened it, and there were pieces of fish. We were like WTF? We asked the waitress, to which she replied, yes, that's #55. We asked if #55 was fish, and not spare ribs, to which the waitress replied yes. She then goes back into the kitchen, and moments later, the cook comes out, asks us if we wanted spare ribs, which we confirmed. He then said he would cook us the spare ribs, and took away the clay pot full of fish. It wouldn't have been so bad if the spare ribs were amazing, but what came back was a few lumps of meat on bone that was submerged in black pepper. Of course, there were no apologies. If you go to their website and look at their menu, #55 is clearly NOT fish.  After we finished what barely passed as dinner, we got our bill, and gave our dedit card to the waitress. She seemed to have a lot of trouble with the credit card machine, and apparently entered in the wrong amount the first time, so she had to do a refund and start a new transaction. Normally, not a big deal. However, she was fumbling around, not saying anything, then going in and out the kitchen with our debit card, then finally someone showed her what to do. In the meantime, we were starting to wonder if they had taken down our debit card number, and if our checking account was going to be wiped out by the time we got home (did not, thank god).   Needless to say, we won't be back..."}
{"text":"I love this place! Came here for the first time 3 years ago with a Vietnamese friend who vouched for the place, I now bring my mom here every mother's day and on her birthday (we eat after our massage at Oasis down the street)! We love it. Always start with the spring rolls and the rice flour crepes. For entrees we get beef/chicken pho or mi quang (really good). Once in a while, we'll do the catfish soup or the spicy chicken. We've never been disappointed with a meal from here.  Drinks: my mom always gets the salted plum soda, NOT my taste at all, but she loves it. I stick to Thai boba.   Great place in unique downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"Well worth the drive out from Toronto. Very tasty and excellent service."}
{"text":"Its pretty good Pho in a nice quiet location, Charming."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 4 -5 years and they are amazing! It's usually always busy but they get you in and have your food served in a timely manner. Their spring rolls are amazing as well as their pho. I've also tried #23 and if you enjoy vegetables this is a great entree. The staff always remember me and my usual order and are always warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious gem in the west valley. Portions are small but they are reasonable prices so I just kept ordering more"}
{"text":"Love the food here. It is small but worth it. John is a great person to talk with and the staff really knows the menu. I go here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Waaaay better then pho than they actually care about there customer service not like pho than where your left alone and never checked on for a refill lol"}
{"text":"Place is clean but portions are small. Also the pho broth is one of the worst I've had, way too sweet and oily without depth of flavor. Also the flank was too fatty as well."}
{"text":"good food, service was friendly but a little slow in terms of getting a check and a box.  I did get the rice flour crepe, it was good but I have had better, this one was very thin outer layer of crepe and didn't have as much flavor as I have had at other restaurants.  I loved the Boba smoothie, was a little melted when it showed up but it was delicious.  I would give this place a second shot."}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times but never completed a review of the business. Let's see where to start.   This place us super cool and it is inside of an historic home. The service is top notch with everyone working hard and extremely friendly.   I ordered the chicken fa which was awesome. Coupled with fresh veggies that you have the option to put in the soup is great.  It's too bad I was working I would have loved to wash it down with a nice bottle of Sapporo.   I look forward to coming to little Saigon every chance I get. If you are ever near downtown Glendale this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"Still the best Vietnamese food in town. For that matter, the best asian comfort food. Always a good meal. My wife and I hadn't been in almost six months (stupid diets) took a friend from out of town last night, and it was amazing... just like we remembered it. John (the owners son) and his wife Ha, remembered us, and asked us where we had been! LOVE THIS PLACE. This is a must try restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been to about 20 Vietnamese places. I mainly get pho or rice plates but this place is great. Pho soup tasted great, eggrolls (kinda on the small size) but still taste awesome. And the rice plates or awesome. This was the first time I've had a beef salad and it was soooo good. I would recommend it. Out of all the places I have ate pho this place ranks in my top 5."}
{"text":"Been twice now. We are Pho-natics and have been to many Vietnamese places in Phoenix. Although not as good as Pho Trahn overall, this place is far better than most. What distinguishes it: service is very good, something that many Vietnamese places lack. Very clean, and has a relaxing patio (beware, they frequently have the patio closed however during the \"cold\" moths) and the ingredients they use are much higher quality. If you've been turns off by the fatty, low quality cuts used in Pho in other places, this is your place.   Also, while the Pho gets the most attention (Pho Bien and the pork/beef are excellent) the Hot Pot (K got the seafood) Soup was amazing. Very generous portion and almost sweet to the taste with a good amount of acidity. The Pho is very balanced in its broth but the hot pot is delicious if you're looking for something different."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I've been there twice.  The steamed catfish was some of the best catfish I've ever had, and probably much healthier than the fried catfish you would find elsewhere.  Their pork was excellent too, not to mention their superb desserts.  I strongly recommend getting the fried banana.    Moreover, the servers made me feel very relaxed and at ease.  The Vietnamese are a chill, friendly group of people who really know how to blend different flavors into pleasant dishes."}
{"text":"Poor service! 3 dined, 2 served and 1 forgotten. Said, \"Sometimes you all can't eat together, we are busy!\" Wouldn't comp meal had to take mine to-go.  :("}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for almost 20 years now.  My favorites are all the items under the vegetarian section."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good food. Service was alright. A little on the slow side. Spring rolls weren't the greatest, but I did enjoy the chicken and shrimp plate I ordered. Pretty inexpensive.  I'd definitely go back if I'm back in Glendale, AZ."}
{"text":"I guess I shouldn't compare the Vietnamese food in Arizona to Vietnamese back home in San Jose, CA because there is definitely no comparison! If you're Vietnamese and looking for good, authentic Vietnamese food, you won't find it here. The portions are small and when you order drinks, 75% of the cup is filled with ice. I guess if you're really desperately craving, then this place is okay. I, for one, will wait until I go back to Ca to fulfill all my cravings."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  You have to get the spring rolls, and wrap them in lettuce with the radishes and mint and all of the garnish that comes with it and dunk it into the sauce!  You will want to go back over and over just for these!  The food has always been really good and we love the place!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating pho and I loved it. My friend who is a bit more of a pho connoisseur said it was definitely above average with a good taste to it. The spring rolls were delicious and we got an egg noodle dish that was very nice-not too greasy which I like.   We also loved the outdoor seating on the patio under a lit up tree (jazz music from the coffee shop across the street added to the ambiance). I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Our favourite place for a quick beef pho in fragrant broth + cold vermicelli noodles with BBQ meats. Food is consistently good and reasonable in price. Always courteous and personable. The place is getting very popular with the locals, but deservedly so. Come early to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"My friends and I needed some fuel prior to our all-day board game meet, and what better way to fuel up than through delicious pho/vermicelli?  Restaurant size: Ample amount of space for parties of all sizes (maybe not 8+ though)! Booths and bench seating available.  Food quality: Yum! Noodles were soft, meat was well marinated, spring roll was crispy...not too difficult to mess it up!  Service: The servers were pretty attentive and quick in terms of seating us, taking our orders and returning with food. Nothing extraordinarily out of the blue, and no bad habits to note.  Final thoughts: Not a bad place to come in and grab some Vietnamese cuisine, if you're in the area and have a hankering for it! The place is *CASH ONLY* and they have an ATM right beside the cashier if you so need."}
{"text":"Favorite place for viet flood.  They close really early. It says 8pm but sometimes stops letting customers come in around 745pm. But even if you get their before 745, sometimes they will tell you things are sold out, so come early. Usually a line up as well, but this place is worth the wait.   Our favorite dishes are the pho and the chicken and pork rice.   Very homey feel to the restaurant.  They don't take credit card."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh restaurant!  If you are in the mood for Vietnamese food, this is the spot to go to.  Family owned, and you can taste the time and effort they put in to their food."}
{"text":"A fantastic Vietnamese restaurant right next to a giant T&T supermarket in southern Richmond Hill making the trip even more worthwhile. You can do your grocery shopping and get some fantastic take out.  Now, I've only been there a few times, and I've only ordered the beef noodle soup although I think my father ordered their chicken noodle won ton and he liked it. I have not had their vermicelli but I find that the most significant and revealing test for any restaurant is to taste their broth. If it is bad, they are cutting corners, lacking skill, etc.  I've eaten from Vietnamese restaurants from Barrie to Hamilton and everywhere in between hundreds of times. I've probably been to at least two dozen distinct restaurants, too. As far as Vietnamese restaurants in this area go, I've had a good sampling to compare this to.  Little Saigon has a delicious beef broth. Very likely one of the best I've had. It's full bodied, not overwhelmingly salty, and doesn't have any strange aftertastes (like some places that do not keep clean). Portions are good, prices are decent. If you want some Vietnamese food, this is an excellent place to go.  It's a small restaurant but I've never seen it packed so reservations are unnecessary. Extra points: The last time I went there, I had to slam on my brakes driving my Pho home and it fell over. Didn't leak! Bravo. I also walked in and ordered soup and received it in a few minutes.   Beware: They have a sign that says \"Cash only\". It's nothing fancy but offers some standard Vietnamese fare at low prices. Parking isn't too bad, either because of the giant plaza it is part of."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking to go eat some Thai food and searched Yelp for reviews. We spotted Little Saigon and it's great reviews. We have never had Vietnamese food before. We decided to give it a shot. The place is a cozy little house in Glendale. We were welcomed by the son of the owner and he greeted us like we were family. We were seated promptly and a great meal ensued! We especially like the veggie fried rolls app. Delicious! The curry chicken dish was good, but the cuts of chicken could've been better. We will be back and recommend you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Really tasty pho soup, vermicelli and shrimp (or pork or any of them) rolls.  I moved to the GTA more than a year ago, found Little Saigon through Yelp and I have become a regular since then.  The staff is always very nice too.   Note that it's a small place, cash only. And it's getting popular. I usually go, order and pick the food up 15min later.   They used to have a shrimp tortilla that was the best, but it's been a couple of months since it's not available anymore."}
{"text":"We drove 25 mins to this restaurant after a recommendation. When we arrived, there was a sign that said 'wait to be seated' and a sign in sheet. We signed in and waited. Servers saw us but ignored us. Figured they are busy. But the restaurant doesn't seem to be that busy. We decided to wait a little bit longer. A server saw us and turned and walked the other direction.. Hmm there were also other people behind us. Guess they just didn't care. After 15 or so mins of them not acknowledging us we left. Sometimes it's a hit or miss for good service but the drive was too far and the unnecessary wait was irritating. Might try this restaurant again if in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! The staff is friendly and they make you feel like you are at home. I take people who have never been and they fall in love with the place everytime."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. The soup was delicious and I would definitely come back for some pho in the future!"}
{"text":"4 stars for cleanness; I like it when restaurant is clean, not sticky and they don't have the \"fish sauce\" smell like other Pho places :)   3 stars for food. We ordered grilled chicken vermicelli, it was very fresh from the cucumber to bean sprouts, I could see and taste that they were fresh.  Chicken was good, seasoned well but a bit dry.    Cold drink served in a take out plastic cup so I didn't feel like to rush to finish it :)    For sure I will go back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here so many times and it's so good. Tried many Pho place this is also the best."}
{"text":"Go to Vietnamese place in Richmond Hill. Also fresh, consistent, and good quality food.  Highly recommended, but may need to line up during peak hours"}
{"text":"Go to Quan Hy in LA, CA and your opinion on the food here might change. To me, food was okay."}
{"text":"I went in today for dinner with a friend We had the house special noodle, spring roll, grilled pork roll. The spring roll, grill pork rolls were very good, the noodles was not the best I ever had. And the menu is very limited and they did not have my favourite drink ( che Ba mau )If you're looking for something that really authentic try pho Linh from Monday to Thursday they have the spicy crab noodle it is to die for. Friday to Sunday they have spicy beef noodle soup if you can't handle spicy make sure to tell them, because they make it very spicy."}
{"text":"Amazingly good food, fresh and authentic.  I really wasn't expecting much given my other attempts at eating Asian food in Phoenix.  Service is friendly and effecient, portions are generous for the price... it's a little lacking in ambience, but what cheap authentic asian restaurant isn't? ;)  Only been here once, but everyone enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"My biggest complaint is that it will take me years to get through the menu! Their food is good and its a true family run business. The atmosphere is quaint and intimate. Whenever I go I get the server to bring me whatever they recommend at the time. I have never had the same thing twice!"}
{"text":"I love Little Saigon! Heard about it from my doc and went the same night. We've probably been back at least a dozen times. The ambiance is adorable (makes a great date place), prices EXTREMELY reasonable and the food is awesome. You truly can't go wrong but I advise sticking to the traditional dishes for the most bang!"}
{"text":"Wow a very clean pho place finally.  The semi open kitchen is well visible and they are not afraid to show you the kitchen.  The washroom is very clean, the table and the cutleries.  Honestly many of the pho places aren't very clean, some never clean their table clothes and when they clean the tables, they leave a stinky smell.  Even the metal teapot here is pristine, I'm impressed.  Now to the food part, soup base very good, not too bland and not too salty.  The thin noodle is good and the meat is also very good.  Although this would have been a 5 star if they give just a little bit more meat.  I haven't tried their rice dishes so I can't comment on that.  But I would definitely return to this place.  I did get a chance to try their avocado smoothie, amazingly good!  I don't remember the pricing but if I remember correctly, the larger size pho is $9 which I think is very well priced.  Lots of parking space as it's located within a huge plaza where TNT supermarket is located.   The other downside to this is Cash only although they have a ATM inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Favorite! We love it. Order from them at least once a month. They are always busy so try not to go at lunch time. We love the pot stickers, spring rolls and Beef Pho."}
{"text":"Clean, inexpensive and the Tofu vegetable Pho soup is fantastically flavoured! Remember cash only."}
{"text":"I had the regular rare beef pho. Broth was tasty and not loaded with msg. Noodles were fresh and al dente just the way I like it. Sprouts and herbs seemed very fresh. Service was friendly and quick. Very very clean place. Sarachi and fish sauce available but no chili oil on tables (I didn't ask but they may have had some available). It was slightly pricier than average. I would go back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"The best Pho place I have been to in the Valley from Mesa to Glendale. I sometimes come here more than once a week. Their peanut sauce is the best Vietnamese peanut sauce I have ever tasted. The staff is friendly and helpful and they know the menu well.  I get the vegetable pho and add chicken."}
{"text":"Best pho in town and the cleanest pho restaurant I've ever seen!!. Been eating there since they opened, sucks that they stopped serving the beef roll appetizer (it was amazing) but still go there at least a couple times a week for the pho :)"}
{"text":"Little Saigon has been our favorite Vietnamese restaurant for over ten years!  Mind you that we don't live in the Phoenix area.  The food is always fresh and it is always 100% perfect.  Each time we go there are other Vietnamese customers dining at the restaurant, which then tells me that the food is authentic.    Throughout the years I have tasted most of their food offerings and it is always flavorful."}
{"text":"Great place, nice and cozy, had the pho soup and Vietnamese coffee and everything was great tasting.the broth was so light and nice loved it.  It must try place."}
{"text":"Great place! I love their food, fresh, delicious. I drive 45 minutes just want come here for dinner. Good price and great food. Definitely top one on my list. :)"}
{"text":"Being this my first time I'll give it 3 stars. I will go a couple more times and then I can really give it a review but for my first experience it was ok. I got the vegetarian spring rolls and the chicken pho, both were good. Nice flavor and fast service.  The booba tea was good too. The only bad thing that I saw was the people who were sitting across from me were trying to kill a roach that was on the blinds! I'm sure they were loyal regulars or something because they didn't make a scene or said anything."}
{"text":"Best Vermicelli I've had in the GTA. Eaten at many Vietnamese restaurants and this one gets top notch for taste and fresh ingredients. Wife comes here regularly for the Pho which she says is the best she's tasted in Toronto. She is Japanese and super picky about both food and her restaurants. Everything we've had on the menu so far has been very good."}
{"text":"This place have the best pho in town. The vercemili salad is one of a kind. Staff is great and good atsmosphete. I recommend anything you will like to try."}
{"text":"Little Saigon, such a quaint little place in [usually] desolate old town Glendale.   Weekends are reasonably busy here, but we came on a Thursday...and were basically the only ones there. Is 8pm really that late??? Come on, night owls, where are you?  Ordered the delicious spring rolls (as described in the review below mine). The sweet fish sauce is such a great complement for these things. Also had the egg crepe, filled with bean sprouts and shrimp. Bean sprouts were fresh, crisp...but the shrimp were a little overcooked. Piling the crepe onto a bed of lettuce, mint leaves, and lemongrass was so refreshing. You can eat so much of this stuff, and not feel guilty. Those were just appetizers.   Now onto the main course. I'm always indecisive about which soup I want, but I settled with the #12, which consisted of rice noodles in beef broth, beef and pork slices, tendon, tripe, and meatballs (consistency was similar to that of the meat in a gyro). With some generous dashes of sriracha, chili paste, and fish sauce, I was in another world. In addition, this lovely medley was served in a king size bowl. Thumbs up to that, and to myself... for finishing the whole thing.   Everyone I dined with was quite satisfied with their dishes, and I would have liked to share a description of each dish, except I was too consumed with my own bowl that I became oblivious of my surroundings about 20 minutes into the meal.   Towards the end, the endearing chef made an appearance and surprised us with dessert- on the house. Nice!   I enjoy coming here... very homey, and lighthearted people. I'll probably visit again this week!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for pho in toronto. The beef broth is really fresh and not diluted like other places. Vermicelli and Tom Yum are both outstanding. There's always a line up for this place. Service and staff are really nice people."}
{"text":"Yes very nice little place to go to eat nice location in Old Town Glendale, been there twice very good food the Pho very delicious and other different dishes.The only thing that turn me off and my wife that they pressure you to eat your food fast. They are running around that's fine with me but took my bowl of Pho half way thru it when I went to the restroom I was kinda full but wanted to take the rest home, second occasion we were told are you finish I said no why? we need this table for other parties , I was can you wait !! the few minutes later the waiter brings the bill for us to pay up and leave..... so we paid and left but never came back to this place again."}
{"text":"Forget the environment, go for the delicious food! The spicy curry vermicelli is what I get every time, after talking to a regular. The menu is big and daunting, so he helped me out by suggesting that, and you cannot go wrong with that or pretty much anything else. It is huge but always packed and amazing! Worth the wait, if there is one.  Huge portions, and great prices too!"}
{"text":"When there's a restaurant that has almost a perfect rating it's a must visit. My wife and I came for lunch and we were lucky enough to get a table before the lunch rush. (Word of advice by 12 it was completely full with people waiting for tables). Being not that hungry we split an order of vermicelli and an order of spring rolls and everything was delicious. The vermicelli was fresh and one of the best ones I've had in Richmond hill so far. The amount of pork we received for the dish was also more than enough. The spring rolls were nicely fried and very tasty.  Service was a tad slow but with a packed house it was a reasonable wait. This place seems to do very well by having a smaller menu and they do it right.  Overall I will come again when I have the craving to try out the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"FINALLY... I found our go-to pho place in the West side.  Excellent portion sizes for the price, ton of menu items, and airy atmosphere (good chance you won't smell like the food when you leave).  Only went here once, but definitely good enough to rate it now.  Food updates after a few more eats."}
{"text":"Was craving Vietnamese food and wanted to try this place out! The outside decor reminds me of restaurants out in Vung Tau! We had an appetizer of Goi Ngo Sen Tom Thit which was out of this world. Wish there were more shrimp crackers on the plate to gorge on hehe  The boyfriend had Com Tam Suon Bi which he thought was pretty good for Arizona standards. I ordered the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio and thought this place was way better than another place we tried last week.   All in all, we would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"THE Absolute BEST PHO on the west side!  Add extra jalapenos for your hangover cure Everything is fresh and hand made in house!  We frequent quite a bit and look forward to our next visit"}
{"text":"Love this place. I am lucky to have a shop 2 blocks from here, so I can walk over any time. Great little house, food is fantastic and the staff is very helpful and friendly!!! If you have not been there yet....get there!"}
{"text":"This quaint little restaurant tucked away in historic downtown Glendale is a must visit for foodies!  Stop in and try the authentic Vietnamese cuisine and you will leave wishing you ventured sooner."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place and people rave about it. The food was good. I've had better Vietnamese in the valley. I went there with co-workers for lunch because they advertise outdoor seating. They rather rudely told us it was closed . The service is pretty bad. They were rude from the start. We felt like we didn't get enough time to look over the menu before someone was getting us to order. After that everything was good until I notice a cockroach walk across the bottles of sauces and up the wall. I'll spend my money where the service is better, where outdoor seating is available, and cockroach free tables."}
{"text":"Man, I love this place.   I usually end up with #23, I don't know how to say it in Vietnamese, but it's damn good. My wife usually gets a #22, which is apparently a very, very, authentic dish. I am told you can only get it in certain areas of Vietnam, it is also delicious.   Spring rolls, best anywhere, I have yet to find a better spring roll from the 20-or-so other Pho places I've been to.  #47 for those of you who like Steak and rice dishes."}
{"text":"Loved this place, very quaint and cute for a get together. I had their springrolls and they were made fresh. I also ordered #26 the crispy & spicy stir fried veggies and noodles, AMAZING. I loved the family atmosphere and the hospitality was great. I even got my tea to go! If you want to try something more authentic and with exceptional service, make sure to stop by at Little Saigon!"}
{"text":"the food was very good I felt bad for the girls there were only two of them for 20 tables full and people want to be seated the beef pho was one of the best I have had in town the veggie spring roll was OK will be back soon"}
{"text":"I visited with my family. I actually came here before but could not get a seat because there was a long line. This intrigued me and hence the review here. We ordered Pho with tofu and vegetables (#157), House Special Pho (#158), Pho satay with rare beef and tripe (#354), Deep fried spring roll (#120), and Shrimp roll (#121). I ate House Special Pho (#158). It was delicious and had a right amount of meat. I also tried the vegetarian pho (#157) that had tofu and broccoli inside. This pho had a noticeably low amount of noodles. Thankfully the server responded and gave us a bit more. The spring rolls (#120) and shrimp rolls (#121) were both passable. While the food was excellent, there were a few things I did not like. First, they only accept cash. Second, everything we ordered was ever so slightly more expensive than in other places. The interior was suitable for a pho restaurant. Everything was clean, including and especially the utensils, which a big plus for me. The server was friendly, though not as responsive due to the restaurant being busy. I would not travel again just for this restaurant. However, I would like to come back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Best pho in town. Best spring roll. Good food. Good prices. Highly recommended. Sometimes there can a wait but well worth it. Good thai tea. we have been going here for many years. taste is consistent. we will keep on coming back."}
{"text":"Been here with my bf multiple times! Id say at least 3 times now! Every time we went we got the house pho and we never get old of it. In fact, i'd say we even crave it sometimes when we're hungry. The prices are so reasonable for the quantity as well! Sadly it is only all cash but it is a small restaurant so it's understandable. The service is super quick too! We usually come when it isn't that busy but even so, it comes in around 5-10 mins after ordering. A medium size pho is super filling. The decor inside isn't spectacular though. Its not anything nice but bad either. I believe it is also family ran. -1 star for that but thats it. I highly recommend Little Sigeon for those craving pho and looking for somewhere not too expensive!"}
{"text":"Their pho is clean and they have specialty pho which is a creamier broth. They are always packed kae sure u account for wait time"}
{"text":"This is the BEST vietnamese restaurant in west valley! Their food taste very authentic. The atmosphere is very cozy. The service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place 4 stars is because they messed up my to go order once and tried to make me pay for their error. Love this place and love introducing people to this place. From the spring rolls to the Pho it is awesome. Everything is delicious and the atmosphere is cozy."}
{"text":"A great restaurant to visit if you are in the Glendale area. I ordered the spring rolls and chicken pho- which were both to die for. And there were many other items on the menu I would have loved to try if I were in the area any longer. If you're interested in having something a little bit different for dinner, check out little Saigon!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend took me here as his favorite place. Absolutely loved the pho I had and definitely will be coming back again to try some other stuff."}
{"text":"This is the first Vietnamese restaurant I have eaten phó at. I have tried other Vietnamese places but none compare to this restaurant. I remember as a child they used to be located inside a mall. All the food on the menu is amazing. I've tried all their spring rolls, soups, noodle dishes, and desserts. I hope this place never shuts down its my favorite place to eat good Vietnamese food. However, will say that their customer service isn't that great at times. They are usually busy whenever I come in to eat. I usually order everything right when I sit down so we don't have to wait a long time for the waitress/waiter to come back around. I have eaten there so many times I know the whole menu so I usually know what I am going to eat before I even walk into the place. I highly recommend the spring rolls ( with extra peanut sauce), any of the soups, the salads, and I get the number #23 noodle dish sometimes. The frozen coconut boba or the fried banana desert dish is bomb too. Whenever I take people to eat there for the first time it becomes their favorite Vietnamese spot to eat at too. I have gotten family and friends addicted to this place as well. Whenever I am in town I always stop by to eat here, even drive across town to get here."}
{"text":"Had the spring rolls (#2) and the #22, which was amazing!!!! Fast service, too! Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. John and Ha are the best! Johns dad is a beast in the kitchen, whipping up some of the best rolls, rice, and Pho Vietnamese cuisine has to offer. There are plenty of places to dine around Glendale, but this place is a must for us when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Attempted twice to come here for dinner. Came too late the first time so they were closed; they closed pretty early at 8pm.   The wait wasn't long but was completely packed. There were still lots of people waiting for seats close to closing time. Noticed the staffs were really welcoming.   Food was really good and fresh. The soup base was just perfect in flavour and the fried spring rolls were crispy (I find that not all pho places make good spring rolls when this is supposedly a signature dish).   Overall, we enjoyed our experience. The presentation of everything was clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"This place is a staple of my diet and for very good reason! Every single item is busting with a variety of flavor and give you an authentic taste of Vietnam. I love the spring rolls with the peanut sauce that I could drink as a beverage if they would allow it. The #37 is my standard with marinated pork chop and grilled shrimp with a side of rice topped with a sunny side up egg. I thought it odd the first time with the egg on top but after enjoying the meal I couldn't think of the meal without it.  I love the pho as well but only during the winter months as soup in the summer never seems appetizing.   Trust me if you love Asian food varieties give this gem in downtown Glendale a shot and never look back"}
{"text":"I've finally had a chance to come back to this restaurant and try their pho.  The service was still amazing so I feel somewhat guilty, but I'm going with 2 stars.  After all, pho is the main factor here.  I was really disappointed by their pho.  The broth was bland and lacked flavor.  The meat was okay, but the portions were a bit small.  I'm gonna have to stick with Central King Eggroll for pho - the only place I've found in AZ that is even close to CA pho quality."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite pho place. It is a nice, small restaurant, located in a plaza. I have been several times now and I will continue to do so. The staff are nice, quiet, but very nice. The prices are great ($7.00 for a regular size pho) and their servings are amazing compared to other places that I have been to.  I have also tried their vermicelli, fried rice, and pad thai, all of which were fantastic. My favourite has got to be their pho. Super fresh! Great place!"}
{"text":"Legit yummy! A friend and I met up for early lunch last Saturday and we loved the character and charm of the remade house, complete with potted plants and picket fence. As Yelpers suggested, I parked at the thrift store parking lot just north of the restaurant, but there's also street parking available on 57th Ave.  We showed up close to open because we were both starving and hate crowds. The inside was small, but I loved the nice touches like flowers on the table along with a full assortment of condiments, curtains on the windows, and fairly intimate setting.   I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of service after reading the below reviews, but it started off great - the waiter was friendly and offered to answer any questions we had. I had a Vietnamese coffee and my friend ordered a plain boba tea. Her tea was great, and my coffee was good, but not awesome. I enjoy watching the coffee sit and drip into the condensed milk myself and savoring that rich aroma, but here, they prepped the coffee in the back and just brought me the finished glass. It could have been a bit creamier, but it wasn't too sweet, and the coffee was delightfully strong.   We started with the shrimp and pork spring rolls (#2), which were a bit bigger (longer) than the ones I'd had in other restaurants, so they were sliced in half - $4 was fair for two of these bad boys. They were absolutely scrumptious and very fresh, but packed a little loosely, so the goodies kept falling out as I was trying to dip the roll. I'd recommend grabbing your spoon and scooping the peanut sauce as you need it. Also, try it with the red chile sauce on the table...yum.   We both had our hearts set on pho and ordered two bowls of sliced beef & shrimp pho, #12. The server remarked that it was his favorite menu item, so we were excited. The plate of goodies on the side did not disappoint, but we could have used some extra cilantro and basil. The flavor was just salty enough, the shrimp were more generously sized that I expected, and the beef was tender and not fatty or oily. I've noticed that some Vietnamese restaurants tend to add oil to their pho, and thankfully, Little Saigon did not. The bowl wasn't very greasy at all.  When we had gorged ourselves on delicious pho, we hung out for a few minutes and caught up. This is when I could see what other Yelpers had experienced in terms of service - as soon as the restaurant started to fill up, the servers became stressed and harried, checking tables with visible impatience. That's a bit ridiculous when you're making your way through a giant bowl of pho. I always tip extra if I stay a little longer, so I wasn't about to guilt myself into leaving. When we left a few minutes later, there was a grand total of two people waiting out in the foyer.   I also noticed that Little Saigon has a sizeable patio area out front with lots of potential, but a sign read \"patio closed.\" If seating's an issue, guys, open up the patio. Shame too, it was a beautiful day. Unfortunately, indoors got a bit stuffy and warm, especially near our window seat. I even checked to see whether the window would open...lol.  Before tip, a boba tea, Vietnamese coffee, two spring rolls, and two bowls of delicious pho came to $30. Not bad for being stuffed out of our gourds.  Overall: solid Vietnamese cuisine, frankly the best (excluding homemade) I've had in the Valley. For you Vietnamese noobs, the menu details everything clearly and is organized by types of noodles - a must for gluten-free eaters (the rice noodles are great!). However, I'll be sure to get there during their non-peak hours to skip the attitude."}
{"text":"My second favorite vietnamese restaurant in the valley. Great pho, great atmosphere... spring rolls are to die for. Can't go wrong with this place, everything is good here!"}
{"text":"Ordered a house special pho. The broth tastes soooo good. I will be happy if I am just given with the bowl of broth. Other than the broth, the pho is chewy though the portion of pho is comparatively small. Besides, it has a few slices of beef, beef balls and beef tendons etc.  On the side, the sprouts and the herbs are fresh. The tea tastes good as well. I will definitely come back again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Fo-yeah!! This place rocks! The first time we went there was based on Yelp reviews and we weren't disappointed. The egg rolls eaten wrapped in mint and cilantro and dipped in fish sauce simply blew us away. I'm yet to taste that kind of perfection anywhere else.  The second time we went, the service kind of put us off. The waiter brought us the wrong order and when we sent it back he made faces and ignored us the remainder of the meal, which we thought was very unprofessional.   My husband gives the 'Fo' 5 stars (a soup with noodles, meat and sprouts ) which is really high considering that he has eaten really great authentic Vietnamese food in Japan and HK. We love this place and will keep going back."}
{"text":"Had high hopes from reviews. Place was literally the inside of someones house. Server seemed prejudiced because she brought our drinks out and never came back. Another server did the rest. And they would check on every table a lot except ours, because they probably thought white ppl tipped better. I ordered calamari and it was a bit burnt at parts meaning black. It was bland. I barely ate any and just drank soup from what my SO ordered. Servers obviously noticed I barely ate, not once did they ask \"is something wrong? Did you want something else?\" They just handed me the check and I spoke up saying I didn't like it because it tasted burnt and bland to me to which the server responded, \"it's not burnt. It's like that because at stirfried.\" Like yeah.... I know what burnt is. I've had deep fried food that was stir fried before and it didn't have black marks on it and taste bitter.. and he's like you can talk to the manager. Like I've worked in restaurants as a server when I was younger and whenever I notice someone not enjoying their food I would ask about it and let the manager know they don't like it not just tell them to talk to the manager about it. So at this time I was upset I'm just like yeah whatever. The guy just walked away without getting the manager or anything. I had to walk up to the cash register to pay. He didn't say anything. All I got was \"sign here.\" I usually tip at least 20% on every meal and this is my first time not tipping. Customer service was horrible. I didn't even eat the food and just left it. Customer service and satisfaction should be their first priority rather than defending it and trying to make someone pay for something they don't like. So cheap! Felt so prejudiced against and then almost forced to pay for shitty service and a shitty meal. Go somewhere else for viet food."}
{"text":"Great viet pho spot if you're willing to line up.  The line ups have gotten a bit crazy over the last few months, and there's always that odd person who will try to bud so it gets stressful waiting.  Food: great, both the soup noodle and vermicelli dish is very good. Broth is not fatty and vermicelli comes with abundant vegetables.   Place: line ups are too crowded, long wait, not many tables as it is a small restaurant.   Service: good and polite and fast.   Price: due to high demand, their prices recently increased on certain menu items.   Overall, would reccomend, but only to those who are ok with a long wait, likely outdoirs as well when the line gets long."}
{"text":"Some of the best pho soup I've ever tasted. The broth is very strong and flavourful. However, the vermicelli was a little bit on the oily side.They don't have all the options you would typically find in a Vietnamese restaurant as their menu is a bit shorter.  It is cash only and I went on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm and had to wait 20 minutes for a table. The service is great and the staff is very friendly, would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Very romantic little restaurant in Glendale near all the downtown shopping. They have good food and great service. The menu has a wide selection with vegetarian options. There is outdoor seating, too! Great place, I'm a regular here."}
{"text":"Service was quick and attentive and the food was good. Not as good as the other place we used to eat Pho at but was OK. Our old place, Central King Eggroll in Goodyear, switched owners and isn't nearly as good as it once was and we're trying to find a new place. Little Saigon was good but not great and the Pho was super greasy which isn't what we're used to.  I would eat here again if I were in the area but won't drive all the way from Goodyear to eat here."}
{"text":"The place was smaller than I expected, which was unfortunate because after we arrived and sat down, a bunch of people showed up but had to wait because a group of 15 basically took over the whole restaurant...  We ordered the pho special, pork vermicelli, and spring rolls. The food was decent. The spring rolls were too oily for my liking. I've tried other places that weren't as mediocre. I'm sure my bf and I will be back if we're craving pho and don't want to drive to our usual place."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is tucked away in the heart of downtown Glendale. Little Saigon is a very small restaurant and does not seat too many patrons at one time. When we went in, there was a couple leaving and we got their table, the last table available. There were only a couple of people working in the restaurant, but they were very efficient in getting drink & food orders, answering any questions, etc.  After a glance over the menu, I knew I was in the mood for some fried rice so I decided to get a grilled chicken plate and substituted for fried rice. My date got the most filling pho soup per recommendation from our waiter. I'm not a huge fan of pho, but my boyfriend really enjoyed it. He said he'd definitely recommend it since it was flavorful and had a lot of meat; like our waiter said, it was very filling. As far as the rice dish goes - my only complaint about the chicken is that it was a very fatty piece. The fried rice however was really good. When we go next, I'd ask if I can get just the fried rice because it was the best thing on the plate, along with an order of the egg rolls. I might try one of the stir-fry noodle dishes as well.  The food & service was good, so we'll be back here in the future!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls were good and the food we ordered was A-OK.  that about sums it up.  Not the great Vietnamese food I ever had but it's hard to go wrong with fish sauce!  Service was decent, too.   We had the noodle salad and pork and beef with fried rice.  It's definitely good enough to come back and try something new on the menu!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! It's so delicious and my husband loves the deep fried banana dessert. The rolls are the best! The waiters and waitresses are always so nice too. You can tell it is a family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Quick summary... this place is awesome! It's located in a cute little part of Glendale in what must have been a house at some point. The service was excellent. We had a super sweet waiter who was very attentive. Their fresh spring rolls were good (and served in a cute little divided dish)  although a little hard to eat.. My filling kept falling into the peanut sauce. The Pho was good as well.. there wasn't a ton of beef in it but it was still filling and the price was right so it didn't bother me much. They offer a variety of imported beer options which is fun and their thai tea boba was delish. Definitely a neat little find while driving through Phoenix on the way back to Tucson. The prices were also the best I've seen for Pho in a while. I'd love to come back here."}
{"text":"One of the best Pho in Richmond Hill. Pho is \"pure\" and clean. Speedy service. Expect to wait in line 10-15min when busy."}
{"text":"My first time exploring a new Vietnamese restaurant in AZ. I ordered the special dry noodles and a friend order Pho special. My noodles came out looking very greasy due to how it was prepared. Very much Chinese food style, the broth is not hot enough, green onions is stale, the broth lack of flavor from the slow cook of the bone, same for the pho. It's a family operation and home atmosphere. The food is not as authentic as I like it to be. The flavor is gear towards non traditional Vietnamese food.  Overall, service is great, ambient is good, food is ok to my expectations for authentic Vietnamese. I would not comeback or recommend to friends if they love authentic Vietnamese food. It's average food to my personal opinion.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Little Saigon is the best vietnamese food you can get in Glendale. Good, cozy atmosphere too. But watch out on Sundays, they close a little early; make sure you get your order in by 6:30pm!"}
{"text":"We went for Pho and it was delicious!  The various cuts of meat tasted fresh and freshly cooked.  The rice noodles were also delicious and they warmed up just right.  We had the fried spring rolls and those were a tad bit on the small side but we could tell they were also fresh.   This place is usually packed on the weekends but if you go during the week, you get seated right away.  Our server was nice and pleasant...she checked on us with perfect timing to refill our drinks.   Highly recommend this place for Pho lovers!"}
{"text":"This small but clean restaurant is conveniently located next to T and T supermarket, so you can come here for a quick economical bite after groceries.  Service was well done, waiter was attentative.  Ordered the grilled lemon grass chicken vermicelli with spring roll, which eventually met my expectations. They proportion the ingredients well, as there was plenty of chicken and veggies. I really don't like it when restaurants overdo the vermicelli, so this place did a good job. The chicken was nicely flavoured with lemongrass and was juicy.  Overall, a good place to drop by for a quick eat of adequate quality for a good price!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to Little Saigon for a very long time.  So glad I finally made it happen!  Wow!  It's now at the top of my list when I get to choose.  I'm going there for my Birthday!  The family that makes it happen is fantastic and the Pho is the absolute best around.  Everything on the menu is scrumptious, Spring Rolls are a must.  It's really difficult to get past the Pho to try the rest of the menu though!    Thank you Cathy and Caroline for answering all our questions and helping us decide.  It's really difficult to get our Vietnamese food anywhere else."}
{"text":"My go to pho place because the place is close by my house!  The portions are generous and the service is quick.    The menu is small but has everything I want.  The broth is also not super oily like some of the other pho places.  I come here usually once a week!"}
{"text":"Delicious and good quality food. I have been pleasantly surprised by this restaurant in the location.  Like many others rated, the vamicelli has been very delicious. Added additional fresh herbs and greens, mixed along with the shrimp and pork made if a great and very lean dish. The service has been very pleasing accommodating. The restaurant itself is a classic average Asian decorated location with a clean interior.   Can more than recommend trying out this place for the vamicelli's!!"}
{"text":"I can't add much to the great reviews, except I had to rave about Little Saigon!  I've tried a few Vietnamese restaurants on the west side, then my hubby stumbled across Little Saigon on his first trip to Yelpland.  Located in charming downtown Glendale only two miles from home, we went there on a Saturday night.  There is a generous patio with lovely twinkle lights, and you can hear the music from the coffee shop across the street.  The interior is bright and cheerful, with, I think, 3 rooms.  The place was almost full - always a good sign, and a very friendly waiter seated us and took our drink orders.  The menu is generous, and the prices reasonable.  We shared spring rolls and potstickers.  Best spring roll ever, methinks: not too much lettuce as filler, delish pork and shrimp that tastes like it once swam, with a light peanut sauce that does not overwhelm.  The potstickers were also great - generously filled with tasty pork and veggies, complimented by a mild Asian BBQ sauce.  We were off to a good start.  Hubs, who is new to Vietnamese cuisine, and who gets props for trying, chose a pan fried rice noodle dish with meat (at least chicken and shrimp) and veggies.  He thoroughly enjoyed it, generously offering me one bite, and pretending not to notice when I stole a couple more.   Just as my bench-mark dish for rating Thai restaurants is Pad Thai, my dish for Vietnamese food is Bun Thit Nuong (or Bun Thit Heo Nuong here).  My bowl had all the right stuff: tender, flavorful grilled pork (not a speck of gristle - a first in Phoenix!), lettuce, bean sprouts, cilantro, mint, and julienned cukes, vermicelli and sauce.  I love the sweet, vinegary sauce that comes with Bun Thit Nuong, and my sweet server told me the ingredients.  It was simply so very good.  Little Saigon has the whole package:  clean, cute, friendly and attentive service, and excellent food.  We can't wait to go back and try some of the other things on the menu, and mentioned in Yelp reviews.  Can you say \"Yum, yum\", Dum Dum?"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it was so good!!!! I had the pork on vermicelli noodle 10/10 !!!! My new  go to pho place!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday evening and this place was very busy.  Pros: - Well priced - Nice ambiance - Good food  Cons: Food is a little bland"}
{"text":"Great mom and pop Vietnamese.  \"Hidden\" location, super friendly service, clean bright atmosphere and good food.  My word of mouth for Little Saigon is get some of this food in your mouth.  I was with Mark R. today, but I may bring my wife here on a date.  The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable.      I did the goi-cuon-chay and then mi-xao-me.  I asked then to make the stir-fry noodles (mi-xao) extra spicy, but it was medium at best. The red chili paste on the table made it easy to add heat, so no problem there.    Digression: The spice issue brings out one of my double standards.  I want authentic ethnic food but, not authentic atmosphere.  Anyone else who has been outside the resort in a third world country should agree.    To the point Little Saigon was bright clean and comfortable and the food was great.  Fire up your GPS and come on down!"}
{"text":"This place is so damn delicious! By far best Vietnamese place to eat and customer service is also great!   I've been eating vegetarian for over a month and every time I eat there I get the veggie egg rolls, spinach with garlic sauce, and there lemon grass tofu that normally comes with chicken but obviously leave the chicken out... And OMG! #foodorgasm! Lol.. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"A good place to go for phô noodles! It's one of our new favorite pho restaurant.  Soup for the soup noodles is hot and tasteful but not overpowering. Great service and a clean place to dine in!  Food came in an appropriate time. The appetizers rice paper rolls are neat easy to eat won't spill out everywhere. Overall we enjoy eating here. Just remember to arrive earlier for dinner to get quick seating availability."}
{"text":"I have been looking at the reviews after friends had recommended this place. My husband and I went last night and the greeting we got at the door was very welcoming. The dacor is nice and I look forward to trying it in the fall in the evening when the lights are on on the patio.   I am glad I looked at pictures in advance because the menu is very extensive. I will definitely be going back. Thank you for a wonderful evening and great food"}
{"text":"I've been here waaaay too much, first of all if you've never had Viet food I suggest getting an order of spring rolls or egg rolls for appetizers and a bowl of beef pho with meatballs for entree. Or if you feel like a rice plate, pick the pork chop and butterfly shrimp. You can never go wrong with what I just listed."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelpers, this is now my favourite Vietnamese restaurant!   The grilled lemongrass beef vermicelli with a spring roll tasted authentic, the fish sauce wasn't diluted like most places, and it's actually ran by Vietnamese people. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Mmmhmmm this place rocks!  The service is outstanding and it's located in a sweet little spot downtown Glendale.  The prices and hours are a bonus and they do serve great unique drinks,  na and alcoholic"}
{"text":"Had the number 13 (the vegetarian pho) and it was very yummy! I don't like that the noodles are one big bundle thrown in on the side because it was hard to take them apart but once I got them separated it was delicious.   Only two people working the front but both seemed to be very attentive and on top of keeping the customers satisfied."}
{"text":"After staring at the pictures on here and being shut down the last time I tried to order out from the place I decided to go in person and give them a second chance.   We went on a Saturday night. Even though the place clearly says you have to be there by 8:30 to be seated, the sign on the door was already turned to the closed side and it was 8:07!!?? What is the deal with this place? I felt like just turning and walking away but the wife insisted on going in. The place was completely dead. Maybe 3 tables of customers and a group of relatives at another table. The inside is like you are in someones house that was converted to a restaurant. Nothing fancy and the walls need a really good scrubbing but for the most part it was relatively clean. The house is located on the northwest side of the street. Just south of a St Vincent De Paul building.   We were seated right away and ordered some spring rolls first. They were clear rolls and were stuffed with shrimp, beef, noodles, and some cilantro. There were two decent sized rolls and came with a peanut dipping sauce. They were tasty but I couldn't help but think they would be much better warm.   I ordered the 27 Pho ap Chao - pan fried noodle stir fry w/ beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, and veggies. It was piping hot and had a pretty decent flavor to it. It had a massive amount of vegetables. I am talking carrots, leaks, snow peas, etc. It could have used a little more meat but other than that it was very good. Then at the bottom of the dish I finally dug my way to the pan fried noodles. They were outstanding. Crunchy but soft. Burnt a little but not too much. They may have been the best part of the dish. My wife ordered some spicy chicken with vegetables. Her meal came with white rice and was huge as well. It tasted very similar to my dish but without the bomb noodles.   The server was very friendly and it seemed very much like a family ran business. The entire bill came out to under 30 bucks and could have fed two more people. I am very glad I gave this place a second and third chance. My only suggestion would be to either stop doing phone orders or provide the extra service and to not put your closed sign up when you are supposed to be open for almost another whole hour. If this place wasn't recommended from a friend I probably would have never gave it another chance.   To their defense they have a sign that states they do not take phone orders when they are busy. Maybe they should at the least put that on their answering machine so people don't keep trying to call back? That being said, their food is terrific, the portions are generous, and I can't wait to go back. Next time I will be sure to try and get there a little sooner."}
{"text":"Yummy. The family stopped by furring vacation. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Hands down THE best Vietnamese spot in the state! Spring rolls are fresh and there is an entree for everyone on the menu. Your mouth will water when you hear the sizzling little pots used to serve their most delicious menu items!"}
{"text":"Another amazing meal. Pork and steak dishes are fantastic.  As usual, pho didn't disappoint. Great food with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Wonderful little place. I absolutely love the outdoor courtyard and the quaint little establishment inside. The waiter was very patient and likeable and the service was quick. Food was spectacular and there was a lot of people coming in to have lunch. (:"}
{"text":"Pho gooood! Taste like authentic Vietnamese food. Great service. We eat here all the time!"}
{"text":"Cute place with delicious food. I can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"The Pho is the best in Richmond Hill here. However the wait is long and they close 2:30-5:30.   Also the service is a bit slow since they're so busy. And they do not do takeout. And only accept cash, but ATM is available inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh the food was so good! My boyfriend and I went there last night and Min was our server. He was super friendly and answered all our questions with out making us feel stupid! Will gladly go there again ESPECIALLY if he's  he server. We haven't been this satisfied with our food in forever!"}
{"text":"Zero stars... Just drove for 30 mins to get here because of your ratings and you are closed? But your site and yelp say you are open until 8pm..... Its 4pm and they sent me away said to come back at 530... Nope sorry not how it works for me anyways..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is definitely a fun place to visit and the old timey Glendale house that they have here is both enjoyable and relaxing inside. It can be a little hard to find so bring your GPS or cell phone.  Came here with my new Yelp friend Michael C for a mini UYE. We were trying to find a new place with some spicy kick and decided to give this place a test drive.  Ordered some Veggie Spring Rolls and some Catfish Soup. Mr Mike went with a Spicy Chicken and Noodle dish and had them make it extra spicy. They also have plenty of nifty condiments to jazz things up a bit on the table.  Both the food and the service were outstanding and the prices were very reasonable. Their menu has a good variety of Vietnamese favorites and you can have them customize the ingredients if there are certain foods that you should not be eating.  Looking forward to bringing my wife here and treating her to a nice comfortable meal. The cool part is afterwards you can go for a swell walkabout around the downtown area and visit some of their really old town and classic shops as well as just soaking up some scenery. I'LL BE BACK!  4.5 STARS"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My boyfriend and I went there on a Friday night for dinner. Service was super fast and the food was delicious.   I took my father there the next day for lunch. Even he complimented on the food. He's the kind that will not eat at a Vietnamese restaurant since it's something we can \"have at home.\" :)   Just absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Love the quaint cottage appeal and absolutely delicious food!!  Dinner for the price of lunch!  Already making plans to bring friends next time"}
{"text":"I went for first time to this place I was really pleased with food and service I ordered the rice paper spring roll with shrimp and pork (MUST HAVE) a chx broth pho and also the rice vermicelli bowl w shrimp, If you're really into noodles this is the place 100% recommended. Plus place is super cozy!"}
{"text":"Solid 4. Fair value for your money. Only exception are the tiny pork egg rolls, 6 pieces for 6 and they're the size of my 7 year old pinky finger. The beef pho was ok, the broth was tasty and the beef was very tender. The barbecued pork vermicelli was also tasty fair portion for seven bucks. The shrimp and BBQ pork plate dinner seemed kind of small the shrimp didn't seem very fresh, the BBQ pork was tender and delicious.  Our server was also very good checking up on us , and making sure we were happy with our meal. I'll go back to this place when I'm in Glendale."}
{"text":"The pho + other entrees are pretty standard, but the thing that sets this place apart from the rest are their EGGROLLS.  Being an Asian from the Bay Area Ca (an Asian Mecca) I've searched high and low for adequate Asian food in Phoenix (a landscape that pretty much only caters to hamburgers and burritos) and I must say that Little Saigon has the BEST EGGROLLS in the Valley, hands down."}
{"text":"Great place for Phó Fried spring rolls were very nice ..  Pork in pork and vegetable wrap was o crooked with burnt edges ..  All in all great phó and sides .. with very reasonable prices  ..  clean place including restroom Very Nice staff Will come back"}
{"text":"Small place and closes early(one hour earlier than window sign). Sometimes is packed. And that is because the pho is really good. Always go for rare beef pho. Shrimp and pork rolls are very good. Must try Vietnamese coffe (with condensed milk)"}
{"text":"Great place to go when craving pho! The restaurant is in the same plaza as T&T so there is a large parking lot. Service is fast and friendly and the place is very clean. I ordered their house special pho which came with rare beef, beef balls, tripe and tendon and the broth was delicious! I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'll admit it: one of the reasons I love going into any type of Eastern restaurant is because I'm still fairly ignorant of the cuisine.  Sure, I'll try just about anything, but half the time, I still don't know what it even is I'm ordering.  I really enjoy that.  The reason I bring that up is that there is SO much to try on the menu at Little Saigon.  It's a pretty sizable menu, and it might not be ideal for the indecisive.  Luckily, the size of the menu did not seem to diminish the skill at which it was prepared.  The appetizers looked like something out of a gourmet food magazine.  The main dishes (at least mine) was served literally still boiling and bubbling.  It all tasted as good as it smelled.  Oh, and since I seem to be addicted to trying new things, I'll advise you on this: the salted plum tea is actually surprisingly good.  While I'm no expert on Vietnamese cuisine, I'm sure I'll find myself back here soon to keep learning."}
{"text":"Back for part two  this pictured here is the best Pho and the best #SatayPho to be had  I almost have to say 'of all time'  actually IT IS.  Experience the most satisfaction & enjoy the time of your life in a bowl of pure liquid love. .  I can't get enough."}
{"text":"What a find during my ongoing Vietnamese food trip - a Vietnamese restaurant which, unlike the others I've been to, is located in a charming converted little home rather than in a run down strip mall.  But the food is just as good or better, and with run-down-strip-mall-eatery prices. Their banh xeo (crispy rice crepes stuffed with beansprouts and shrimp) is awesome, and the generous seafood soup with white asparagus is something I'd order even on a hot day.  One of my favorite Vietnamese dishes is rice vermicelli with shrimp and pork or beef, and while their version is not as bold in flavor as Dong A's, it is definitely quite tasty. The courteous service complements the brevity of the wait between placing your order and receiving your food."}
{"text":"Fresh food. Well mAde.good flavor. Lots on the menu. Each time I get something different. Each time it's better and better.  I was not a fan of the green tea ice cream. It was fresh and I am sure most people would like it."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I love it...perfect and fast service, my fist time here and I will be definitely back for more sprig rolls"}
{"text":"First time eating there yesterday and the food was delicious, the service was great, and the overall atmosphere is very nice and warm. I recommend this place!!~"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite Vietnamese restaurants in Arizona. The loveliest people work here. Very personable/respectful servers, they're able to provide excellent service despite being slammed with tables. The owner often comes out to greet people and makes sure everyone is satisfied.  I've never had a complaint about anything I've ordered here, it's always been flavorful and filling. Big menu and everything is made to order! Prices are really affordable and the portions are great."}
{"text":"Found this little gem while shopping at T&T.   The food is excellent. Although the portions are a little smaller than other pho places, the quality makes up for it.  Ordered shrimp rolls and 2 special pho. The sauce for the shrimp roll is fantastic and the rolls were fresh as well. Soup base for the pho is clean and not too salty.   This place is cash only."}
{"text":"This place is great!! We've been there a couple of times, first with some friends or ours that are regulars, so the staff and the chef already knows them, and know what they like and how they like it. We were treated really good, and the different dishes we tried were soooo good. Between the crepes, and the fish in garlic sauce. Second time we went, we went on our own, and we were treated really good, too. It made no difference that they don't know us, and were not in the company of regulars, their service staff is great, attentive, and always on top pf things. I recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Glendale.  Their Pho is amazing.  The vermicelli with check and egg roles is a personal favorite also.  Service is always good but anything around Noon and you'll be waiting a bit for lunch as they tend to get busy.  This is by my work and I try to go at least a few times a month.  It's worth the drive from wherever you are at in the valley!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and we never really had issues and plus we did come later in the evening, maybe the workers were tired. We sign and get seated in 4 mins, we get out drinks and start ordering. We ordered pho and egg rolls. Takes awhile to get the food, we finally get it. The nuc mam is watered down, and to our luck my bf gets a hair in the food. He was cool about it, didn't make a scene and it takes about 15 mins to be noticed by a waiter, he sends back the pho with the hair. It takes another 20 mins to the pho back. The pho has less meat and broth. At the end we ended up paying for everything or didn't get an apology or discount since the pho did have hair"}
{"text":"Great locally owned authentic restaurant. I love every dish I have tried. Chicken pho, the chicken curry pot, the eggplant vegetarian meal, and so many other dishes. Don't forget to order the fried bananas as an appetizer! Yummy! And they still have the best peanut sauce I have ever tasted at any Vietnamese/pho kitchen. If you like pacing your appetizer and meal make sure to order your appetizer and do not order your meal til you are almost finished with the appetizer. This restaurant does not do very well with timing of meals mostly because it is a small restaurant and they need to get people in and out in order to accommodate everyone. That being said, if they are busy this is not a place to hang out and hog a table for hours. Enjoy a great Vietnamese meal and then enjoy down town Glendale if you want to visit with your friends."}
{"text":"Best vietnamese food EVER!  They make me feel like family when we visit.  Usually, I have one or two things I like at restaurants and stick with those, but everything on their menu is so good!  Gotta try it all."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far and plan to return multiple more times. The place is small but the food is amazing. The jellyfish salad is very refreshing on a hot day. Haven't had anything bad yet and with only 2 visits so far we have managed to sample a lot from the menu."}
{"text":"Actually never tried the food but had the service. Waited 35 minutes without any sort of acknowledgement. Finally had to ask one of the servers and was told it was going to be another 15-20 minutes with a slight smirk. We are \"backed up\" he said. More then enough tables to seat the additional 4 parties behind us just not smart enough with wait management for a restaurant. No apologies, none needed, because I don't think they really cared. Should have walked out within 15 minutes."}
{"text":"But why is this place so popular?? Having stumbled upon this Viet restaurant on Yelp while in the area, I came here for lunch at 11 not knowing that it opened at 11:30. So no biggie, I go walk around the T&T next door for a while and return at around 11:25 to see if they were opened yet. TO MY SURPRISE.. like an actual \"wtf?\" surprise, there were over 30 people already lined up in front of the restaurant???   As soon as the doors opened, people flooded in and seated themselves until the restaurant was at full capacity. At that point, more people were still coming in so they already started to have a queue of people waiting in line for the next rounds!! Insane! I thought I was in for a real treat - found myself at a hidden gem perhaps?!   To my disappointment though, I found the food here to be VERY subpar. Maybe it's because I live closer to the Scarborough area but the pho, vermicelli, and rice wrap rolls here are NOTHING compared to the Viet restaurants I normally go to. From the flavors and textures to portion sizes and sheer variety on the menu, this place just wasn't that good..  The food here isn't bad by any means but I just really don't understand why they would have line ups! ..I'm thinking it's only because there's not much food to choose from up in this area."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Well worth a short drive off I-17 to enjoy some of the best Pho in the Valley!  I've had the Pho, shrimp springrolls (outstanding) and their Kung Pow-savored every morsel.  Service from the owners is wonderful, I love it when a business \"gets it\" and this place is hitting on all cylinders."}
{"text":"Placed an order for pickup within 30 seconds of being on the phone. Food was delicious, we got #21 and #20 and couldn't tell which we liked better both were fantastic. Only complaint is that I didn't get any stuffed shrimp with my #20 and #21 only came with 2 pieces of shrimp.   I would come back, but I'm def going to explore other Pho options in the area first. I give the food itself a 5 star review but not receiving something I paid for is fairly upsetting."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaraunt.   Period.  I did not grow up eating Vietnamese food, but it's now my favorite."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off night. Had the pho and it wasn't that good. Nothing special just plain broth. The guy next to our table sure lived his because he was slurping away(loud slurping is encouraged when eating pho fyi). Had the taro shaved ice for dessert. Let me say it was gross. It tasted like old frozen ice. You know that taste of freezer you can get with food you put in freezer like ice cream? Well thats what this tasted like.  With so many other Vietnamese places all around Phoenix i will skip this place and try something else."}
{"text":"Our first experience here, we ordered the egg rolls and spring rolls.  Both were fresh and the egg rolls were hot.  The spring roll was delicious with the homemade sauce. That in itself was almost a small meal. The grilled beef with Bok choi was simply amazing, hot and fresh.  I accompanied my plate with Sriracha which took it to another dimension.  My sister order the veggie rice noddle soup w/ extra chicken.  It smelled awesome, the classic Pho soup with all the veggies.  The taste was outta this world. Definitely coming back to this place."}
{"text":"One of the best pho place ever!!! Definitely will keep coming. Only thing is you have to wait every time during the lunch or diner time."}
{"text":"Can definitely say it is worth the wait! came with a friend for friday lunch and waited around 20 minutes to be seated. Mostly tables and booths for 2s and 4s so be careful if you've got a large group. It's too bad their grill wasn't working (which meant only soup items were available), but the servers were friendly and mentioned it to everyone in line in advance. Guess most people were there for the pho since no one left even after hearing that...  Ordered the large house special while my friend got the large rare beef pho. The portions are pretty good here for a large size, with a good serving of rare beef, beef ball, tendon and tripe, along with noodles that were a nice thickness. THAT BROTH IS SOMETHING ELSE - full of flavor but not extremely salty or concentrated. Add the lime and hoisin sauce for even more goodness!  Service was quick and friendly, and the place was very well kept and clean. Large bowls were $10, which is pretty in line with other restaurants. If you're in the rhill area, I'd be hard pressed to find a better spot to satisfy a pho craving.     Note: their hours are pretty limited for both lunch and dinner, so pick your spots and days to go! ATM is inside for those short on cash."}
{"text":"Really good food. Really fast and very accommodating. Broth was amazing. Waiter was great to work with."}
{"text":"My daughter took me here from Mother's Day and we had a very delicious lunch and the service was excellent and the waitress was very sweet. So I give it A5 star rating."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Had the number 24 and my wife had number 40. Absolutely delicious! Big portions too. My dish had a delicious fire roasted smokey flavor which I loved, gave the dish a wonderful flavor. Everything on the menu sounds great.  Will definitely be coming here regularly."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  The pho is tasty and the rolls are very good.  The menu is simple and straightforward.  The place is really clean and the waiters are very calm and smiling towards the customer."}
{"text":"Had the mi quang yesterday and it was very filling and delicious!  It comes with pork, chicken and shrimp and a light broth and side of veggies! So good!   Downside is kinda pricey but worth it and I ordered the egg rolls but for six dollars you get these mini egg rolls not very appetizing but over all will be coming back."}
{"text":"Spring rolls were good.  Service was excellent. Pho had a lot of flavor. Portions was kind of small.  Overall good place. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Clean and food is amazing. The service is really good compare to a lot of pho restaurants. Pho broth is clear and yummy. They do not accept debit so bring cash."}
{"text":"Had one of the Vermicelli salad bowls with chicken, quite amazing. A combination of sweet and spice with mint and cilantro. It's amazing and I recommend it. Service was great and a very friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night expecting great food based on good reviews from Yelp!   Bad experience!   I had the spring rolls, pho tai and also the Vietnamese coffee.  The spring rolls were good and the pho was okay.  After I got home, I started having stomach pain and used the bathroom twice.  I don't know if it was the food or the drink that was bad, but I certainly will not go back."}
{"text":"I've dined here 3 or 4 times for lunch and have enjoyed each meal.  Their menu has a \"Vegetable Entrees\" section with a nice list of options.  So far, I've had the veggie spring rolls (yum), stir-fry tofu (yum), and the coconut curry (double yum!).  The employees are very happy to answer any menu questions I've had about dairy, fish sauce, and other non-veg ingredients.  The entree sizes are quite generous, and the staff is so attentive.  Our glasses were filled each time they got about half-way empty.  Every server walking by asked us if we wanted more rice.  And when I got a to-go box, our server offered me extra rice -- how nice!  I work in downtown Glendale and appreciate a great local restaurant that's good for vegetarians and vegans (there are so few down there).  I'll definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"OMG god am I glad I only live 5 minutes from here! Can I just live here and eat here everyday?!? I'm so serious this place blows my mind away!!! It's so ridiculously good! It's really intimate and when you first walk in you may think you are walking into any other hole in the wall Vietnamese joint but boy are you in for a treat! Anything you get on the menu I guarantee will be great. I highly recommend the spring rolls on the appetizer section, it looks like a condom with a bunch of veggies and shrimp and beef stuffed inside but it's amazing! Also if you have never tried pho before this is a great place to do so. I love seafood so I always get the shrimp and beef pho and it never disappoints me. Customer service is great! They are always on their toes to make sure you are pleased! This place absolutely deserves a 5 star. It's a must try!!!"}
{"text":"My go to pho restaurant in Richmond Hill. The pho broth & noodle texture is on point. Vermicelli & toppings delicious. Grill pork fresh rolls are the addictive. Small restaurant in a busy plaza... worth the wait! Not a ton of variety but it's not a bad thing. Service is really good for an Asian restaurant too."}
{"text":"Well ended up at Little Saigon on Sat. night too and again great service and wonderful food. I am always affraid to try new things but I have trusted John's (the server) suggestions and loved them. I noticed going to this place it almost feels like going to visit with family the staff is so nice and even the people that go in there have been really nice. It was packed saturday when we went and there were so many different types of people and I still felt that warm welcoming feeling. I really like this place a lot and so does my family. I wanted to go agin tonight but I didn't want them to think I was stalking the place lol. So if you are ever in the area check this place out it is the bomb!"}
{"text":"My friends have been raving about thus place for months. We finally made it out here to try it. The place was packed for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. Good sign. We waited for about 15 minutes for a table.  Feels like a large house turned into a restaurant. We were seated in s smaller room to the side. Only 2 servers working together. Both were hostesses and cashier and everything else st the same time. One took our drink order and ran off. Before drinks came the other server came over to take the order. Very rushy (is that a word)? I knew what I wanted from the awesome Yelper pics. So I explained to her that I was highly allergic to shellfish. Usually, actually, ALWAYS, when I mention the allergies, the servers go out of their way to make me feel welcomed. Always accommodate my needs and triple reassurance that my meal will be prepared and cooked separately and without contamination to any seafood. The server with a smirky and \"not my problem \" attitude told me that everything was prepared and marinated with fish sauce and contaminated with seafood while under preparation. Which I thought food preparation had to be separated. However, she then went on to tell me if u get hives I can't help u. If u need an epipen I can't help you. Her attitude was enough for my hubby and I to say thank you but we'll pass. And left to eat at a friendlier more accommodating Asian restaurant. Actually made me sad because the food looked so good but I'm not going to put my health in danger. And I will not let my allergies become a joke to unprofessional ppl. Had a nice lunch elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great place! Found it through Yelp after the Glendale Chocolate Affaire. Fresh coconut milk actually served in the shell! I've never had a better vermicelli dish? #33, Stir Fried Beef & Onions. Friendly family serving you. Vietnamese patrons. You know you're in the right place."}
{"text":"Have wanted to try this spot for a while and was not let down. The service was friendly and prompt and the restaurant is in a cute little house, off Glendale Ave. they were super kid-friendly as well. As for the food, we did Boba smoothies (the boba was cooked perfectly), veggie pho (really delicious broth and all the wonderful accoutrements) and a vermicelli salad. Everything was so fresh and cooked beautifully. I live in Phoenix, but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm no expert on Vietnamese cuisine, but my first experience at Little Saigon made me want to learn more.  This place is wonderful, and you should try it next time you find yourself in Glendale.  The fun begins before you're even seated, as the restaurant is in a little old house.  The tables aren't jammed together and the artwork is eye-pleasing and relaxing.  Friend and I were impressed by the friendly, quick service.  But the food impressed us even more.  We had the potsticker appetizer, one of the best ever... not the sticky white dough typically found in a Chinese restaurant potsticker, these wraps are more like a thin French crepe, beautifully browned, filled with pork and veggies.  The dipping sauce on the side was delicious, though we also made use of the condiments provided at every table, namely fish sauce, sriracha, chili-garlic paste, and soy sauce.  We had two salads... #96, jellyfish salad with shrimp, pork, julienned  carrots and other veggies, and some herbs... and the #97, the lotus root and shrimp salad, also containing pork and julienned veggies.  Either salad could pass as a meal and we got the SMALL versions.  The flavors are off the charts on both, savory, herby, ginger, fennel, just delicious.    For entrees we got the #51, lemongrass chicken, and #55, bite size pork ribs with caramelized onions.  Both arrived at the table in clay hotpots, still bubbling, and were savory and satisfying.  We have resolved to go back to try the pho (which looked very good as we ogled our neighbors' tables) and other tempting offerings.  This place deserves the 5 stars, and your business.  You'll thank  me!"}
{"text":"1st time here? Try a rice bowl, #50 is AMAZING. I also suggest you save room for desert, the shaved snow is FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"I had the experience of my employer ordering from Little Saigon for a luncheon we had scheduled.Never having had Vietnamese food I was weary but that changed. The spring rolls and soup were SO GOOD and so filling!! Look forward to trying more goodies from here in the near future."}
{"text":"Just moved here from San Diego and wanted to find a great place to grab pho and I have found it!!! Great place at a great price."}
{"text":"Took my oldest friend here  today for lunch, and got him hooked. He's lucky since he just lives about 2 blocks from this place. He had 2 pork chops shrimp with an over easy egg, a salad, and a side of veggies. I had the #64 beef and shrimp with veggies in a brown sauce. It was delicious, and just the right size for lunch. My friend took home a nice snack for later. This place will is worth the time for lunch, but get there early because it's small, and it fills up fast."}
{"text":"This place was quite solid and authentic! Although there was a line and pretty cold, we didn't wait too long. We tried the chicken vermicelli, beef ball pho, pork rice rolls and the hot viet coffee. Everything came quickly and was very fresh. Portions were good and the broth of the pho was great. I didn't get the typical thirsty response after I eat pho (usually a sign of too much msg).   Their hours are a bit weird but if I'm in the area again, I would come back."}
{"text":"The GF girl says: So I had the number 8 pho ( rice noodle with meatball) which is what I usually get at other places. I've never had meatballs that tasted like the ones at Little Saigon. They were crunchier than usual and didn't taste very appealing. They tasted like they had been frozen or bought premade. Otherwise, the soup broth and noodles were excellent.  The GF girl parent says: I had the rice paper roll appetizer with rice vermicelli shrimp, cilantro, and pork. With peanut dipping sauce-delicious. And filling.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Little Saigon for almost 20 years. In that time I have experienced several other Vietnamese restaurants in the valley, but consider only one the best - Little Saigon.  The place: A family run business located in a quaint, converted house that has a great vibe. Lots of warm feeling wood and decorated with traditional Vietnamese art and items. This is the only Vietnamese restaurant I have been to that cares about it's appearance as much as the food. The bathrooms are very nice and clean. Other Viet restaurants are usually found in strip malls, having all the ambience of going to the DMV.   The staff: Always friendly and attentive, especially John and his wife. John's dad is usually in the kitchen making the fantastic food that has kept me going back for years. If you ever need guidance through the extensive menu or need help on what to order, John will hook you up.  The food: Now let's talk about the best part of Little Saigon, the food. From the Pho to the Bun and clay pots, Little Saigon has it where it counts.  Fresh herbs and vegetables (nothing canned) and tender meats make it a great experience.  My personal favorite are the Bun bowls (Rice noodle salad).  The meats are marinated and gilled, having lots of flavor.  Noodles are done to perfection and the lettuce greens and herbs are always fresh.  The Pho (soups) are the perfect thing for a cool day and even in the summer. Flavorful broth with noodles, beef slices or meatballs (yes, meatballs) and more of those great herbs like mint and cilantro. Yum!  My wife is a fan of the clay pots for the slightly more intense flavors found with these meals. I enjoy them as well.  The beer I prefer to drink with my meals is the Vietnamese \"33 Export\" they serve. Similar to Tsing Tao, but seems to have a little more kick, ;)  If you are trying Vietnamese food for the fist time, I highly recommend Little Saigon.   You won't be disappointed and probably will get hooked like I did years ago."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and it is amazing. The pho is on point and the potstickers are soooo good, I most definitely will be coming back again!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a couple others. It was busy... So I thought it was a good sign.  Flavors were good... We had the brisket pho and lemon grass beef on rice.  But the portions were about 75% of our favorite place.  Perhaps they just had a bad night as it was super busy... So portions were inconsistent and a bit slow.  Might come back and try again."}
{"text":"My top two Vietnamese food places to go to. The broth is A M A Z I N G as well as the egg rolls. They put taro in the egg rolls which I think gives it more flavor and a different texture. Worth the 20 minute drive from my house."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! It one of those restaurants where is hard to be honest and say how great they are because you know if anyone finds out, it will be packed! The pho here was amazing, next time I will be trying another option on the menu."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times, run by actual Viet people very friendly staff. The food is good! I can vouch for the pho! The lemon grass beef is probably the least favourite item I've tried. The vermecili bowl is great! Lots of food for the price. Not as cheap as other Viet locations but there isn't much for selection around Yonge and Major Mac.  They are closed on Mondays and close every nigh at 8pm. They won't even do takeout orders when it's too busy. For that they lose a star."}
{"text":"If you are Gui Lau stay away from this place as there is discrimination big time. Tried to go for a bun at 2pm the other day, I was by myself. They sat me down, gave me a plastic cup with tea, everyone else in restaurant had a full pot.  I ordered in less than a minute then watched 2 tables come in after me, and had to watch them both get their food before me.  And who the hell in this day and age doesn't do takeout? Never again."}
{"text":"We came in Friday night for dinner. There were two parties ahead of us so we passed the time by checking out the menu. Keep in mind, I hate seafood, I don't enjoy the taste, the smell, and I definitely don't like how sick it makes me. Being a Vietnamese restaurant, I knew my options were limited. I hinted to leaving but I lost that battle (thankfully).   We started off with Vegetarian Egg Rolls that were better than most places.   I had chicken Pho (7)  and my bf had a chicken dish (52)  My Pho was AMAZING. I was smiling the whole time and kept uttering, this is AMAZING. I wish he enjoyed his dish as much as I enjoyed mine.    While we were waiting another party politely asked how long it will be. He snapped and said \"maybe 10 min, maybe 30, I don't know when people are leaving\"  That was enough to make me want to get up and leave. I did not like how he talked to people. When he was seating us some lady gestured that she needed something and he rudely dismissed her.  Once we were seated all the staff was super friendly, but until you are actually at a table they can be quite rude.   5 for my food   2-3 for service"}
{"text":"Walking in this place looked nice and clean. The pho was good, the broth was great, and I don't think they used MSG either! The man who served our table was really nice as well. Well, but why the 3 stars?   First, I ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee, but he told use that the ice machine was broken (what?). Okay, fine. I'll have a hot Vietnamese coffee. Shortly later, I hear them making a slushy drink (which presumably uses ice....). What the hell, I thought their ice machine was broken?  Secondly, my coffee never came. I walked up to ask him the status on it, and by that time we were already close to finishing our meal. So, I asked if I could have it to go, and they said no they don't do that...it's almost as if they just didn't want to serve me coffee.  Third, my girlfriend ordered bun (vermicelli noodles with pork). While it tasted fine, the pork was more bacon meat than BBQ pork chop type of meat. Sadly, this was her first bun experience. Although it was bacon meat, the marinade was still great and tasted as if bun BBQ meat should taste."}
{"text":"I absolutely love eating here for lunch! They have a lot of vegetarian options but you can always customize your dishes to make them vegan like I do. This place is very clean and cozy and has great customer service. To top it all off the food is delicious and authentic. I highly recommend it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with anything I've ever ordered from there. Everything is delicious, especially  their soups and shave ice cream. The staff is really nice as well."}
{"text":"Love Little Saigon at Richmond Hill, ON! A small gem that many locals come for their Vietnamese meals.  Expect lineup and long wait.  My wife and I waited for about 30min on a Sat evening and the food was totally worth the time.  The waiters here are friendly and helpful.  The food is very good.  We ordered fresh rolls, beef pho and a vermicelli with grill pork.  The rolls were super fresh.  The regular size of the pho was large enough and the vermicelli - oh my! - it came with a fried spring roll and it was soooo good.  Overall the food was very good - fresh and good portion, and the price was reasonable.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great spring roll! The pho wasn't great enough to make the wait worth it. Besides, pho should be quick!"}
{"text":"I ordered to go around 11 am and definitely the food wasn't fresh at all. On top of that I found a strand of hair. It makes me lose my appetite. I guess I won't be return here again. I give 4 star for the Mixed veggies that taste pretty good and 1 star for the Pho Dac Biet ( it tastes awful)."}
{"text":"This is a nice quite little restaurant. The people here are very courteous and friendly! The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it never disappointed me.  I love the pho here.  The soup base is amazing.  Service is also great! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wecame here for lunch. We waited about 10 minutes to be sat at a table. Spring rolls were delicious. Pho was excellent, veggies looked like they were just picked out of a garden. Lemongrass chicken was surprisingly flavorful. Even though server was busy she did a great job. We never had to ask for refills on iced teas. Jasmine tea was so good. Lunch was under $30 cheap for all we had"}
{"text":"I have made an effort to try different things each time i go here and i love it all! The food is always amazing and the atmosphere is just great. Nice and attentive staff!"}
{"text":"The servers here are always very friendly and knowledgeable about their food. They have a few veggie items on their menu. On my last visit I had the veggie fried rolls and the Bok Choy Ginger soup which was siprisingly tasty given it's simplicity. My boyfriend really likes their Pho Ga. *Note: the spring rolls come with warm marinated meat which I do not care for."}
{"text":"I went in with family who visited from out of town and we were in the mood for pho. This was my second time coming in. I ordered their meatball pho and it wasn't too convincing. Usually I like to start eating pho without any added ingredients. But it clearly needed it right away. No matter how much sauce, lime, cilantro, sprouts I added I just couldn't find the flavor. I was surprised on the reviews and ratings on this place but we really didn't like it here. The customer service was great but the pho was disappointing. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I think all of the positive reviews about Little Saigon actually clouded my judgement for a bit. I came back to this restaurant for a second time recently because I had forced myself to believe this place was above average due to all of its glowing reviews.  Now that I think about it, it really isn't that great - both times I came were on a Saturday afternoon, both times had a pretty lengthy wait time for a pho restaurant (~10+ minutes), and both times the food was decent but the service was meh.   So far, I've tried the house special pho, vermicelli, and deep fried spring rolls. These are all standard and popular dishes - tastes pretty good but not good enough for this place to have an above average rating on Yelp.   The service here kinda sucks. I'm not one to complain about my seating, but I seem to always end up at the smallest table for two right by the door. It's an awful seat because the door is always opening and closing, leaving you very cold in the winter, and there are always people lining up and waiting to get a table right by where you're trying to eat. I understand this may be out of their control. However, the table is so tiny that it could barely fit all of the dishes I ordered. Once the appetizers were finished, the servers didn't bother taking them away, leaving me in an uncomfortable position (when I was already pretty uncomfortable) to eat the main course. It was really difficult trying to speak up and get a server's attention to either take a plate away, ask for sauces, napkins, or the bill throughout my whole meal.  Overall, pho should be quick and easy and this place has a lot of unnecessary wait times that aren't worth waiting for. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese Restaurant is located in Old Town Glendale with all the cute shops. The atmosphere is really charming because this restaurant is a very old tiny cute converted house. This time I ordered the large chicken salad. I received a really big mound of fresh crispy cabbage mixed with light as air iceberg lettuce. My salad was laced with fresh herbs and white meat chicken and a fresh light limey dressing. It's a perfect meal for when your running around and it's hot outside. I thought the small salad would be too small but the large is more than I can eat. So small salad and and an appetizer or dessert is the way to go.  My husband had a pork and rice plate. It was very good and came with a fried egg and a crispy pork filled roll.   I wanted to try a macaron but our server got busy and slapped our check on the table while we were eating.   So we paid and left."}
{"text":"For a nice spot to grab lunch in downtown Glendale, this is one of our favorites.  Good food, and good value for what you get."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this is the place I was thinking. The last time I was here was actually my first time. And now that I've remembered this place, I really want to go back. I came here the day before my 19th birthday. I have no idea what I had but I do remember my little brother had gotten a coconut shrimp soup and OH MY GOSH was it delicious! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I'm so excited to go back now and try that and see what else they have. Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Great and close to home! Quality as good or better than any other I've been too. Like the texture of the noodles and all toppings were fresh and tasty. Beef was perfectly thin and rare."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing prices and cute atmosphere. Conveniently located in downtown Glendale. I wish they would reopen the beautiful patio!"}
{"text":"The food here is so darn good!! I love the spring rolls and their authentic menu. Great service,  they truly make you feel like family."}
{"text":"I go to this place on the way home from school. Every time, I order the spicy lemon grass chicken with rice. It is really yummy. Lots of flavor and veggies which I love.  However, I dislike like how they give me only one bowl of rice. I love rice! I always order extra and the end up giving me no charge which is great. The waiters and the owner who is the main cook in the back are super nice!"}
{"text":"Pretty good when you need close by Phó place... Good service every time I go there. Pretty fast with their food. 4 stars, not enough seating while waiting to get waited on."}
{"text":"I love coming here with my friend that I introduced to Vietnamese food. The staff is always pleasant and seem to appreciate your business.   The spring rolls are our favorite to begin with. It's right up there with our obsession for the Jasmine Tea. You can't go wrong with the many exciting food choices on the menu. We could try something new every time and be satisfied with the choice.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great place for good Vietnamese food.  We had the pork rice, beef pho and pork rice rolls.  The pork was not burnt, full of fat and tasty.   The broth for the pho was tasty and consistent with everything else the rolls were good.  The service is top notch-efficient and polite.  The premises is comfortable and clean.  Found this place based on other Yelpers good review and this did not disappoint.   Found another go-to place in RH!  Next time I will post pictures-was hungry and dug right in this time!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant for Vietnamese food in the Valley. We eat a dish I cannot pronounce, that is char-grilled meat wrapped in grape leaves and served with rice papers, rice noodles, fish sauce, and veggies. You build them yourself. Sooooo delicious. The staff is real friendly. The restaurant is a converted home, and it is darling. Outdoor dining as well. It's the best"}
{"text":"Little Saigon is the best Vietnamese food I've had in the Phoenix area.  The restaurant is family owned and the food is great.  I suggest the Rice Vermicelli with grilled pork and shrimp."}
{"text":"Although I have highly raved about Little Saigon, it appears that service can be hit or miss. I initially had a 5 star review rating food, environment and service. However, awhile back I visited with family during lunch time it was not at all busy and we waited approximately 15 minutes to just be greeted and seated, another 15 mins or so for someone to get to our table to greet and order drinks and again 15-20 minute wait for food and the orders for a family of (3) didn't come out at the same time. My Brother's dish was forgotten about and had to wait again another 15 minutes or so.  During our visit it was extremely SLOW.  Many other patrons were also not greeted and waited a long time. I was surprised when this had occurred with the Owners who were both working at the time and on the floor.  I am reserving my thoughts a bit on how I feel about this place. It once was a great find to quickly turn into a bad experience. A shame when I had family who visited from out of state and we drove 16+ miles to dine here because I raved about it so highly.  This particular visit was disappointing. I've been back once after this and the service and food was very good. Perhaps a VERY OFF day for them."}
{"text":"Love love love! Every time to drive up to the valley we always make sure to stop by and get some great food here. Love #25! Great small little place in downtown glendale. Thing I love the most on how it's tucked away from the street, it almost feels like you your pulling up to your own private hidden place."}
{"text":"Best pho in town. We are here on a regular basis and everything on the menu is delicious You could really feel the owner and management cares about their business and the food they serve. Cash only!"}
{"text":"The best curry ever! We got #53, wanted to lick the bowl it was so delicious. Service awesome and super affordable."}
{"text":"Great local Vietnamese cuisine! The service was awesome and the food was amazing. Of course, you have to try the pho!"}
{"text":"This place is the jam, and the boyfriend and I's go-to spot. The hours are a bit annoying, as sometimes you just miss them, but the food is great. I never really liked phô all that much before I went to this place. The rice bowls are great, the drinks are great, it's all worth writing home about  (or writing on Yelp about)."}
{"text":"Some pretty kickin' pho! I have lived in the Bay Area and this place is on par with my favorite pho places there!"}
{"text":"Pho was AMAZING! It's a small spot, not very fancy at all, and the menu is short and concise but everything was extremely fresh. My husband and I are huge fans of Pho and frequently seek out new spots; this is definitely going to be one of our top 3!"}
{"text":"4.5 Star Food, 3 Star Portion size, 2 Star Service.  I've had the vermicelli salad and the fried rice, and the spring rolls.  All were typical Vietnamese fashioned food.  The wait staff, one guy and one girl is constantly busy and curt, and only basically just want to turn their tables, so if you go in asking questions don't expect any good answers or suggestions.  Size of dishes is smaller than other places, at least the vermicelli salad was, although it tastes great, as does the fried rice."}
{"text":"When I came in I was instantly pleased by the \"fish are friends not food\" sign on their aquarium. I knew this was a good sign. The patio option was closed when we were there.  I like the price and food selection ranging from pho to noodles to shark fin soup (I must try it!). With so vast a selection, I find it hard to be on point with all dishes.   I asked for a recommendation and ordered what looked like the easiest dish to make. A thin slice of pork and beef, fried rice, and a side salad. The most intriguing was the salad with delicious lightly pickled vegetables acting as a dressing. I thought the fired rice was rather bland and greatly benefited from a healthy dose of soy sauce (WARNING: not fish sauce is in smaller sized soy sauce bottle). I also tried the potstickers (highlight dipping sauce), shrimp noodle dish, and spicy chicken rice dish our company ordered. All solidly good, nothing remarkable."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick and well priced.  Now our go-to Vietnamese.  Everything was flavourful and fresh.   I had the rice noodle bowl with grilled pork and spring roll.  Served with the perfect amount of salad and noodles.  Lots of fresh herbs made it extra delicious. The shrimp rolls were tender and also had fresh mint and cilantro inside.  Served with a yummy dipping sauce.  It's a cash-only place.  They have a \"white label\" machine there in case you forget."}
{"text":"Just ok. The broth was tasteless and the meat in the bowl was scarce and way over priced. The staff did not carry a professional or friendly demeanor. We are now lifers at Phoenix Pho."}
{"text":"Had high hopes based on reviews, cute setting, but terrible service and garish lighting. The chicken pho was good, the steamed catfish was good, but extremely fishy, so if that's a problem you, beware. The waitress was abrupt, then ignored us, brought the food but no utensils, brought the bill without asking if we wanted anything else, never asked how our food was. Never made eye contact. Won't be back."}
{"text":"3.5  First time here was on a week night they close early after 8pm you are out of luck it wasn't busy ordered beef pho and grilled chicken spring roll vermicelli  by default the fish sauce is tad spicy so if you don't want spicy let the server know both were  a tad above average portions were good and price was good staff was friendly service was good the place is very clean I went there on the weekend second time it was like night and day literally totally totally packed waited half an hour for a table and people kept pouring in and it's was like 1:30 p.m. this time we had dac biet pho  and shrimp roll it came with a huge sauce which is nice I think I will try this place again bonus is plenty of parking in the plaza"}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean, and friendly.  The service is good and the food is tasty as well.  I found the menu didn't have much selection, which is something I always look for when I am eating Vietnamese food.  I like a variety of different options of meat with my pho, vermicelli, or rice dishes.  Most dishes only came with just one item.  I believe they close quite early as well during the weekday, as once I came and they were already closing.  I'm usually a late dinner person, so places that close a bit later I tend to sway towards."}
{"text":"My husband introduced me to this place and I can't get enough of their egg rolls! I love the fresh ingredients used and the simplicity of the dishes. Yum. The servers are extremely nice and always helpful in case I need advice on something to eat! ;)  John is always a pleasure so hopefully you'll get the chance to have him serve you! But either way everyone here is wonderful!"}
{"text":"This place has a great feel once you first walk in their door. The fish tank is really cool too! The fish seem exotic or something? Really, really neat. The place is not very big in size, which gives it that intimate dive restaurant feel. The courtyard/ patio in the front would be great for a group if you looking for a little more room.  This place is right in the heart of old town Glendale. Parking was not an issue at all when I went for lunch time. I parked in the thrift store parking then walked over. Seemed like a few others were doing the same thing as I noticed pulling up to the restaurant.   Once I got sat I noticed the menu was mostly in Vietnamese and had English translation as well. I wasn't sure what to order, as it was my very first time being here, or even to a Vietnamese restaurant for that matter. The server recommended the Pho, and a eves dropping customer also insisted that I try the Pho.   So I ordered the Beef and Shrimp Pho, along with some fresh spring rolls and  a Coors Light to drink. The Spring rolls where very different than what I was used to. They were extremely fresh wrapped in a weird film like texture of some sort. It was very delicious! The dipping sauce that comes with the rolls is perfect for the rolls. They bring out all the add in for the pho before the bowl of broth arrives. The add in consist of mint, cilantro, lemon, jalapenos, and some type of sprout root. Once I tried the Pho, I was blown away by out great it all was! It was actually really exciting and fun eating Pho since it was my first time. I can now see why everyone keeps recommending the Pho here!  What a great experience! I cannot wait to return here again."}
{"text":"This place has really changed! I have been going here for years, I ordered their pho and it was probably the worst I have ever tasted. Super salty and bland! Do not go here, this family is greedy."}
{"text":"What makes Little Saigon so special is the quality of the ingredients. The meats are lean, the veggies are fresh. I am a huge fan of Vietnamese fresh spring rolls, which are not baked or fried. Filled with rice noodles, shrimp and pork these are a refreshing starter for any meal... they can be a meal on their own! I like the bahn xeo (which reminds me of a thin fritatta filled with bean sprouts). The pho is great with all white meat chicken (and I kick it up a notch with the hot sauce and hoisen which are already on the table)! When I'm not in the mood for soup, I like to get the vermicelli dishes and have tried most of them over the course of the past two years. Satisfied every time! This is a great spot for dinner before Glendale Glitters or any of the many other festivals that take place in downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"Number 37.... Awesome!  Quaint place, small but inviting.  Clean and funny listening to the employees yell at each other in Vietnamese.  Decent wine and beer selection.  The pork on the 37 was AWESOME, and I'm not a huge pork fan.  Sliced thin, juicy and full of sesame ginger flavor.  Who can turn down an egg on a perfectly cooked scoop of white rice?!  The egg roll  was perfect and the shrimp....wow.  I'll be ack VERY SOON!  Wanted to try the boba but no time, I was on lunch break."}
{"text":"The pho was excellent. The service was very good. The place is nice and clean. It is cash only"}
{"text":"This is my favourite pho place. Found it thanks to fellow Yelpers. Thanks!!  It's a smaller restaurant that seats around 40 people max. Cash only.   Service is friendly and is run by Vietnamese.   It is one of the cleanest pho places I've been to and I've been to quite a few across the GTA.  The bathroom is really well maintained.   On to the food:  The broth is sweet and really delicious.  I don't normally drink a lot of the soup but I can't stop at this place.  I usually order their large special which is $9.50 and is a big bowl of noodles.   We've also tried the Tom yum soup noodles which are good.   Their spring rolls are crisp from the deep fryer and go well as an appetizer or as part of a Vermicelli dish.   Overall I highly recommend. Just remember to bring cash. They do have an ATM though."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been in Glendale for close to 6 months now. This is the only restaurant I think is worth mentioning so far. They are way above everything else we've tried; in fact, they deserve to be in an entirely new category.  I would strongly recommend this place. Don't waste your money eating junk out of restaurants that are just tossing the same old garbage at you.   This is different and very good.  We had several appetizers, a couple main dishes, 2 beers and 2 glasses of plum wine and with a tip, got out of there for just under $50. If the awesome food doesn't convince you, maybe the cost will!  ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese food. Try the fresh coconut milk too!"}
{"text":"Its sadly a one star rating. Been coming for years but haven't been back in at least 8 months. Im giving this rating in hopes that they make changes.   First, very dirty and cluttered.   The outside area has seats but has never allowed seating because they are too lazy to clean it.   Bathroom looks like your 75 yr old aunties house..you know the one..and soap is watered down to literally water.  Needs a major update and cleaning.   I ordered the pho soup, as I always have. Meat was very rough and not fresh. The meatballs had a strange taste and the broth tasted light like water.   Hope the place improves."}
{"text":"I found my new favorite Vietnamese spot.  Its cute, quaint and located in historic downtown Glendale.  Lots of businesses located in downtown Glendale are in charming historic homes.  The front patio had several plants and vines on the white picket fence gave the a feel of entering a secret garden.  Once your inside you can tell this was a home at one point, wood floors throughout.   The hostess has you sign in.   After a short wait we were taken to our table.  Our drink orders were immediately taken.  I got some hot jasmine tea and lemonade and my daughter cold jasmine iced tea.  My hot tea was brought out in a cute porcelean tea pot and tea cup.    We then placed our food orders.  We got veggie egg rolls, chicken fried rice and rice noodles with chicken and veggies.  The egg rolls came out first and oh my holy egg rolls were they good.  Fresh lettuce, cilantro, cucumber, basil and jicama to roll up your egg roll and then sweet fish sauce to dip.  Soo good.  Fried rice tasted like actually fried rice.  The noodle stir fry was also amazing.   This is a nice little hideaway to sneak away and enjoy great food.  After you eat you can also enjoy all the antique shops in Downtown Glendale.  Perfect Sunday date with my daughter!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place?  The veggies are so crisp and delicious, they make me want to find the source and buy some for home.  I'm not going to pretend to be an expert in the cuisine but everything I've tried here is absolutely delicious and I can't pronounce any of it.   The outside of the restaurant is adorable and kind of romantic and the inside is unassuming and seemingly clean.  I think it's very reasonably priced for such fresh and flavorful food."}
{"text":"Very very good food! I am very particular about my Asian cuisine and this place is awesome- fresh, flavorful and satisfying! I had the spring rolls and then the spicy chicken stir-fry. So good and the vegetables were perfectly cooked! Great service as well- very friendly. Can't wait to come again and try another dish!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant discovery made via Yelp. Sort of a treasure in the seemingly deserted downtown Glendale, this place must've been a home at one time and is now a cool little spot with some amazing Vietnamese food. The boba tea smoothie (taro) is one of the best I've come across in the valley. Our group was very satisfied after our first visit and we all agreed that we'll be returning again."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall exceeded my expectations. So far every dish we had satisfied my taste buds except that some were a bit oily. The shrimp salad and the pho(sliced beef) were delicious. The crepe is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great little place. We always wanted to try it and finally had the chance. We have gone to many Pho places around the valley and this one definitely ranks up there. Very fresh and the place is spotless. The number 11 is definitely a hit. The number 26 was a bit small on portion but not on taste. The drinks we had were Taro Boba, Thai Tea Boba, and Vietnamese IceCoffee which my wife says is too strong but I totally enjoyed it. Come check them out but be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I want to remember so hard what number each meal I've tried are but I can't. So I'll just kinda explain.  First time I ordered Jasmine Tea and their crispy noodles I want to say #26. Loved the crunchy noodles!!!! I added some of the chili paste they have on the table just because I love it, but really it doesn't need anything else. The veggies were on point and although it didn't have many pieces of chicken I had so much fun enjoying the noodles I forgot their was supposed to be chicken on my plate. Haha!  My husband ordered a plate that had shrimp and chicken with a salad and rice. The rice is perfectly done and the chicken tasted good. You could taste the coconut oil which to me tastes amazing.  On a different ocasión I had the spicy chicken with lemon grass. When it came out it was served in a plate that was sizzling hot which means it will stay hot for a while since I talk to much. You can taste the lemon grass and whatever else they add to this. They bring some steamed rice for you and you can either pour the chicken on the rice or add the rice to the plate. I mean you can eat it however you want the outcome is the same! DELISH!  I ordered a limeade which on the menu it specifically says they make it there. It's good!  Haven't tried the rest of their stuff and will definitely go back to try different numbers on their menu!  Let me add it's not expensive either! Ha! Who doesn't like delicious food for a fair price! This girl!!!  Enjoy! Don't be scared to check it out!"}
{"text":"My husband really wanted to eat here because of all the good reviews, but it was disappointing we order grilled chicken and shrimp with fried rice. The chicken wasn't clean nor cooked properly the shrimp was dry, the rice was ok but to little of it, we all left our dinner.Sorry but I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Just a great Vietnamese place in Glendale. Had spring rolls, pho, beef in xo sauce, shrimp in curry sauce, calamari and the beef/ shrimp combo and they were all winners. The service was great and were treated like family!!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best Vietnamese in the valley, and definitely my favorite west of I-17.  Charming little place in a small house, right in the middle of downtown Glendale.  I've been here a few times and never had a bad dish.  Usually I go with pho or a noodle dish, but this time we branched out.   I got the #37 pork tenderloin with shrimp and egg - a delicious, thin marinated pork chop that was simple yet satisfying.  My wife got #56, which is a spare rib with a sweet and salty sauce, baked and served in a clay pot.  The dish is very flavorful and probably best shared between two people while paired with a less savory second dish to even out the palate.  I see a few complaints about the service - it's never been a problem for me, though they did recently stop taking Amex cards so no luck burning my recently received gift card..."}
{"text":"What a little Asian gem among these parts. I didn't have much of a chance to try different pho joints back in Illinois, and I imagine there aren't too many here. But nonetheless, Little Saigon has great pho. We had the beef pho; broth was flavorful, and the option to put in as many or little veggies as you want was nice. My boyfriend said the combination fried rice was possibly the best he ever had. We had enough leftovers for two more meals."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was great.  Environment was very good, bathroom was clean. Had the banh khot for appetizer which was very good.  The mi` ddac biet main course was great.  The chuoi chien for desert was excellent."}
{"text":"Took us a while to finally make it here, but I'm glad we did- it was a treat! This place is tucked into a side street in downtown Glendale and I'm sort of sad that it took us so many years to get here. Service was fast and friendly even though there was a pretty steady stream of people coming in.   The food was all delicious. I had beef pho, and hubs had some sort of roll your own spring roll thing. This was some of the best pho I've had here, and I've tried more than a few. The broth actually had enough flavor that I almost didn't have to add the extra garnish, but of course I did anyways. It was salty, tangy, and just a little bit sweet. The beef was cut up into manageable pieces and there were tons of rice noodles. We had spring rolls and a strawberry boba smoothie that were equally good. While this place was a dollar or so more per plate than Da Vang, it was closer and the food was better."}
{"text":"My second try with Pho. I love it!  I had the beef and meatball. The broth was hot and flavorful. With a little hoisin and some soy sauce added took it up to the next level. I dropped in a good handful of fresh bean sprouts. My only thing I would say I put some whole cilantro and mistakenly thought I could chew it and swallow. Next time I will strip the leaves. The stem got stuck in my mouth. One meatball had a large piece of grizzle but the meatball itself was finely ground with great spices. Those little things didn't bother me. The price is right. This little place you could almost miss when driving on 57th Avenue is super clean and has very efficient and friendly staff.  I will definitely try not again on one of their other dishes."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Very cute shabby little home turned restaurant that has plum wine and great noodles..what more is there to say!? I have had the hot pot, lemongrass soup and Pho on my visits here and was alwasy pleased. They also offered Macaroons on one trip there which I felt was strange but enjoyed every last bit of them."}
{"text":"This is a bright gem in downtown Glendale.   The food is excellent and the service was great.  I highly recommend this restaurant and look forward to returning again soon.  One piece of advice --- do your homework on-line.  The menu is extensive and can be overwhelming once you sit down.  I had made my selection ahead of time using their website menu (I ordered #2 and #56 - HIGHLY RECOMMEND both) and by reading Yelp reviews.    The only negative thing I have to say is that the noise level was HORRIBLE in the 'banquet room' where we (group of 14) were seated.  I will never go back to Little Saigon in a large group as it was difficult to hear what the person sitting next to me was saying.  The noise seemed to bounce off the walls.  Also, be aware that if you are in a party of six or more they do not split the check and will not take more than one credit card.  Another reason to go in a party of 1 or 2.    Overall --- FIVE STARS"}
{"text":"I always love coming to Little Saigon! The food is always fresh and delicious! The staff is always friendly and helpful! I am working through the menu, and so far #81 and the fried bananas are my favorites!! It is always clean, and the best part is that it is family run. It is located in downtown Glendale, so after a phenomenal meal, you can always walk it off afterwards."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here over a weekend and what a cute spot in downtown Glendale. The restaurant had a lot of charm since it was originally a single family house. Service was very attentive and friendly. Prices were also reasonable. We had entrees including Egg Noodle  Soup (Mi), Tofu Lemon Grass Hot Pot and Tofu Vegetable Curry. All were really great. They also had a cute patio out in front that I'd imagine at night would be pretty with the more residential street, trees and lights. Great place that we would return to again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Great staff. Nice to families with small children. The VIET ICED COFFEE is so good. I went in sick with a head cold and feeling like I was done for 2 or 3 days. The waitress told me that a big bowl of PHO would make me feel better. A big bowl of Viet style Chicken Noodle Soup and lots of tea and I felt human again. I bought another portion to take away. Tastier than any cold medicine. The food here is better when You are healthy and You can taste it. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Our favorite Vietnamese food in AZ. The Pho is huge, flavorful, full of noodles and delishisness. The curry is perfect. The right amount of onions, carrots, potatoes and Chicken. It's so good you can drink it. The spring rolls are a favorite of my wife and they are not fried, yummy and healthy. The ambience is local and fun. A must try for those who love asian cuisine."}
{"text":"The hubby and I had a yummy lunch on our \"day date\" today.  I had the 37 (pork, shrimp, fried egg on the perfect white rice) the Hubby had the 47 (steak, bells, onions, rice) we also shared the potstickers app.  I like the iced tea a lot. Very mild green tea.  The app was my favorite part, very good! I loved the fried egg on the rice, and really, the rice was the example of what perfect rice is. The pork chop was very yummy. I tried the Hubby's steak and it was very good, and I love the deep caramel onions, wish there were more.  I wasn't blown away with the salad and sauce, Saigon Kitchen set that bar high for me.  I very much look forward to coming back, trying other things on the menu, like Pho in the winter :) oh yeah."}
{"text":"Dear gods I love this place. I am sitting here right now writing this review daydreaming about the spring rolls.  As for the pho, I have heard from many reliable sources how delicious it is. I put too much cilantro in mine the first time, but even so it was pretty good. Just uh...make sure you go with someone that knows how to eat pho, because I did not and that's why I messed up. Make sure to put the meat, bean sprouts, and noodles in first. Everything else is up to your own liking.   Now this place is a 40 minute drive for me during rush hour, which should show my devotion. The staff were friendly, the food was ready when I got there. Just be prepared for there to be a lot of old asshole customers. You know the kind. Snow birds. But if you tell them to fuck off, you'll have evening entertainment too.   Now excuse me while I go daydream about the spring rolls more."}
{"text":"I have tried 5 different Vietnamese restaurants in the recent past.  This one stands out in my mind as the best of them.  And none of them had any reason not to go back.  For one thing the setting in the old house is great.  And it has a shaded patio out front.  I had a chicken dish with rice which came to my table still at a full boil.  I would have liked to try the egg rolls but 6 in an order would have been a full meal in itself.  The party next to me had an order of spring rolls and egg rolls and their comments were good.  I went in the middle of lunch on a Friday and it was almost at capacity but I was seated right away and there was some delay (maybe 5 minutes) in taking my order but the food came out in a normal time.  As in many Asian restaurants it is a family operation with the son of the owners being my waiter.  Being just over a mile from work I will be back again.    Parking in downtown Glendale can be a hassle at times, less than a block away on the NE corner of 57th Ave. and Glenn Dr is a lot that only gets full during special events. In fact the downtown area is small enough I would park there to go almost anywhere in the area, but I don't mind walking."}
{"text":"I love little Saigon. Super clean, super friendly, great service and the food is delicious and cheap.   The pot stickers are stuffed to the seam with shredded (not minced) pork and are seared and steamed perfectly.  I usually go for the Pho but will switch up for the beef and shrimp rice vermicelli every other visit. I always want Pho tho.  I've never left disappointed. I think I'm a regular now.  Another nice to know is that most of the cafés, restaurants and coffee shops have their own mini version (not as artsy and far from crowded) of First Friday activity. Little Saigon sits in the hub (if you will) of all things cool in DT Glendale. Alley way karaoke seems to be a common attraction. Most of the boutiques and antique shops do close up early so the most you will get is some interesting window shopping.  Fill yer flask, take a stroll."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon with my brother since we were near downtown Glendale.  It is slightly hidden, but if you have Yelp you will FIND it.   =)  It is a house converted to a restaurant, so it is pretty small.    I ordered #1 Cha Gio:  Deep-fried egg rolls filled with ground pork.  Dip those yummies in the sweet fish sauce, I am gravy!  These were good, but I still preferred the \"normal\" size egg rolls.  Then I got #8 Pho Ga: rice noodle soup with shredded chicken.  The soup base is pretty good, plenty of noodles and cooked to the right texture, and the shredded chicken not fatty so excellent.  I also ordered the soy bean milk.    All in all I like the place and the food, but it is on the pricey side for Vietnamese food compared to other places.  Oh the service there is great.  The two servers were like basketball players.  In sync and great teamwork to make the customers happy."}
{"text":"What's up with all the 1 star reviews?  Perhaps high maintenance reviewers?  This place is a solid 5 star experience.  Have eaten lunch there almost a dozen times.  The food is traditional Vietnamese.  By far the best in the Valley.  And if you've ever visted Vietnam you'd probably appreciate this place even more.   Only wish it wasn't a 40 minute drive!"}
{"text":"The trek from Ahwatukee to Glendale is loooong, but luckily I have family in these parts, so we come here often.  Hands down, the best Vietnamese food I've had in the valley, no contest.  The place is a very small converted house, and truly, because of the size, you feel as if you are there for a friend's homecooking rather than at a fancy restaurant.  So small in fact, that if you have a large party (which they can absolutely accommodate, by the way) you should call ahead.  I know some people call this a pho restaurant (and the pho is good - not the best I've ever had, but good) but really, it is absolutely a Vietnamese restaurant first and foremost.  Given the extensive menu with a long list of homestyle dishes, pho doesn't take a backseat, but it's certainly not the star of the show.  The one thing that I love about Little Saigon is that every dish comes with copious condiments.  Cha gio (crispy spring rolls) come with mounds of lettuce, cilantro, mint, carrots and daikon with bright nuoc mam (fish sauce) for dipping.  All of the soups include cilantro, mint, basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno and lime - I will instantly dock points if I'm having pho and I don't get all of the above.  Plus, crazy good dishes like the Curry Catfish with Black Pepper Sauce (served on a sizzling plate for two) come with rice and lettuce for wrapping as well.  Favorites of mine are the Summer Rolls with tasty shrimp and bits of grilled beef, Bun with Grilled Pork, the Pho with Meatballs and the Caramelized Catfish.  Even the fried rice that my husband always gets is savory goodness.  One important thing to note, though the waiters are perennially friendly and bustling, and the owner/chef is fabulous, this is not the place to make special recommendations or changes to the dishes.  If you are a fussy eater or want things your way, 9 times out of 10, you will not win that battle.  We've been coming here a while, and have seen some interesting antics between the kitchen and the dining room.  Just order and enjoy, the food truly is so good, you shouldn't have to make special requests as it is.  Very very worth the trip to Glendale.  I'm jealous of you guys, west side!"}
{"text":"This is such a wonderful and cute little joint to eat at. Service is perfect and the owners are the best. They always make us feel welcome and make sure we are happy and satisfied. Of all the pho places near by this is by far my favorite. Have never had a bad experience !"}
{"text":"Some of the best pho I've had! The broth is super tasty. Everyone that works there is very friendly and welcoming. They made sure our drinks stayed full the entire time we were there. I got pho with chicken broth and shrimp, my husband got shredded chicken. Both were great. For desert we tried their shaved ice. I ordered it with coconut ice, chopped mango and strawberry and condensed milk on top. Everything delicious and fresh. The restaurant itself is very cute and inviting. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Downtown Glenedale, who knew?! An adorable cottage houses the best Vietnamese restaurant in North Phoenix, if not all of Phoenix! Family owned and run, you feel more and more like part of the family with each visit. They have a foundation of loyal customers built on word of mouth.  An extensive menu of usual  Vietnamese dishes. and though they have fab pho, my favorite dish is the barbecued fish (off the menu)- hand delivered on a steaming platter by Dad himself! One of these is enough for 2. Wash it down with a '33' beer and take a leisurely stroll through downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"Excellent experience all the way around. .  Food was excellebt, hot and fresh, homemade noodles...you could make an entire meal out of the potstickers... pleasant environment and staff, very accommodating"}
{"text":"Wow, this was well worth the drive from Glendale. Everything was super clean and food was top notch. They cooked my egg and pork chop perfectly. Reminded me of home food. The drinks are super yummy!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE Vietnamese place in the whole world. A true hidden gem. Great service. Amazing food. I always get the same thing-bo cuon la nho (beef stuffed grape leaves). Not many places offer this dish. This order is fun because you get to build your own spring rolls. I drive all the way from south Phoenix to come to this restaurant, and it's 100% worth it every time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese pho, you best skip this place. Otherwise, the food is decent. It's a bit on the pricey side. The only size they have is the large bowl and that comes to about $8. I only come here when invited by friends, but there are better choices for pho out there."}
{"text":"This place is a small place but the food is really good. But most of the time they are busy and the parking is bad especially if there's alot of people.   The food is really good especially the fried rice and the soup was really yummy as well. I would recommend people to come here even just to try if you love vitnames food this is the 1 place I would go and try if you are in the glendale area and the souranding is really nice if you like to walk around after you eat because for sure your going to be very full so a walk is needed which a plus because this place has a great place to walk around.  I recommend you also try there desert. Most of the time I come here I always try to make room for the desert. It's really good and it just melts into your mouth."}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood spot. The food was superb and service excellent. We enjoyed a grilled chicken vermicelli salad, stir fried vegetables, pork ribs and onions, and a make-your-own spring roll meal (#79). If I lived nearby I'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"Best pho in phx area. Tried the limited time oxtail pho... man it's tasted delicious. Meat was perfectly tender, flavorful broth. Lady's were very friendly and welcoming. Will be back."}
{"text":"Lived close to this restaurant for years and never thought to stop until my bestie had me stop in. SO GLAD that she referred me. Very yummy, family owned.   Makes me want to go there now :-)"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Vietnamese restaurant that I have been to in Phoenix by far and consistent. This is my girlfriends favorite spot to eat she would rather come here then go to an expensive meal any day. I highly recommend giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"During winter time I sometimes like to get away from chaos and for some reason having pho soup alone while reading a good book is the most satisfying feeling ever.   I stumbled upon this cute little vietnamese joint in Richmond Hill,and after living in the Hills for the past 3 years, I'm surprised I never came here before.   I had the Pho with beef brisket (M)- 7.00  It was piping hot and quite flavourful. I really enjoyed the dish and the noodles to beef ratio was perfect.   dinging off one star as the service was a bit choppy (missing napkins at the table, tea came during the meal... but meh... it was good overall)   Will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu.   btw. CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Everything is so delicious and authentic here. Maybe slightly more expensive than the others but definitely worth every penny of it. Friendly staff and great service too. The only down side is you have to prepare to wait (most of the time).... but that's when you know the food is good right?"}
{"text":"Visited again with our friends and food was just as good as before.  Fresh, quick and ample dishes.  Spring rolls were delicious as were #33 and #35; bun (noodle)dishes with meat of your choice, cukes, bean sprouts, shrimp., lettuce and tangy sweet fish sauce to pour over the noodles.  Add some Sriracha and eat!  Pleasant service and excellent prices."}
{"text":"Short version - they don't care about their customers!   I tried to dine here on three separate occasions knowing the food is most likely still good. But this third time (and last) has completely turned me off this place entirely.  They're generally pretty busy, give out numbers to be fair to customers waiting.  On two of the three occasions, I have seen empty tables not occupied just left empty and at the same time people piling up at the door waiting for their number to be called. The most frustrating part, is people walking in, seeing others waiting, spotting the empty table and just taking it - literally by passing the number system. The waiters have even seen this and said nothing to enforce their own number system, nor defending the people already waiting and actually giving them a menu and tea. I've seen this happen twice now.  If you're going to put a system in place to be fair to your customers (first come-first serve system) you should abide by it and enforce it. I'm severely disappointed that they didn't say or do anything and will not ever be dining here again.  Before the only issue was slow service (which probably created the wait) but pretending to turn a blind eye to someone jumping the line (for a system you put into place) is stupid and tells me you don't actually care about your customers getting fair treatment."}
{"text":"I have pho at least once or twice a week. This is hands down my favourite Vietnamese place in all of GTA. If you like your soup to be full of MSG and fat, this might not be the right place for you. The pho broth is fresh and you can tell it takes time to make.  Everything from their pho, to tom soup, to spring rolls, is made with precision and care.   The only thing I hate about Little Saigon is that it isn't open 24/7."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit.   It is small and clean, and the staff are friendly.  I haven't had their pho yet, but I will soon enough cause I'll definitely be back. But I had their pork and spring roll vermicelli - take out no less. Everything was packed up nice and neat, fish sauce in its own container, and toppings neatly placed in its own area (I don't really like cilantro so I tend to pick it out if I forget to tell them), and thankfully it wasn't mixed into everything else.   The pork was seasoned and cooked nice, not dry. And the spring rolls were still very crispy when I ate it. A+!  The only bad thing about this place is they are cash only. They do have an ATM in the back of the store, but come on!"}
{"text":"We've been to Vietnam many times and have tried all the famous and not so famous places for Pho and this place is honestly the closest you can get in Toronto. It's definitely better than the two famous places on Ossington.   We've been coming since they opened when they used to offer 10% off to bring in business to now where you go wait a long time to get seated if you don't come when they open because the cats out of the bag on how good it is. They are so busy that they don't even allow takeout on Friday and Saturday nights.  Large Beef Ball and Flank Pho ($9.00) The Pho here is fantastic and always leaves you wanting more. The soup is not oily, doesn't make you thirsty and has this nice sweet taste to it that makes you crave it once you are done your bowl. The beef balls are the ones made with tendon and are super bouncy and the flank is high quality and has a nice amount of fat.   The fried spring rolls are 2 for $4.50 and are absolutely delicious as well. How good are they you might ask? So good that I forgot to take a picture of them before we devoured them. The spring rolls use the thicker wrappers that are crunchy and have a lot of meat and filling inside.  My only wish for this place would be for them to open up a bigger restaurant so we wouldn't have to wait so long for tables but the fear with that is that the quality would go down with more tables to serve.  Since we come back regularly, I remembered to take a photo of the spring rolls and the fresh summer rolls.  Fresh Summer Rolls (2 for $4.50) The rolls here are freshly made and all the ingredients are of high quality. The dipping sauce is absolutely delicious and brings together all the ingredients. Definitely a must order when you aren't feeling for the fried spring rolls."}
{"text":"This is my absolute FAVORITE pho place! The pho is about $7, and the serving size is perfect for either lunch or dinner.  You don't get skimped on the veggies or noodles.  That's for sure. :) Every time that I've eaten there, I've had stellar service as well. Helpful hint: go on a Sunday at like 1 or 1:30. The restaurant is tiny, maybe like 25 tables or so (not counting the small patio area outside); so, it fills up fast.  Make a night or afternoon of it! Since it's in the middle of downtown Glendale, you're surrounded by cute antique shops.  Check it out! You WON'T be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing.  We ordered it to go, It was ready when we got there, Came with extra sauces, Along with tons of additional produce.  Great service as well.  Overall a great place and delicious food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, cleanliness, and price. Will definitely tell my friends and return soon. Herbs are super fresh, and Pho's soup base is clear and tasty. Best Vietnamese place in town for sure!"}
{"text":"\"Authentic food with great flavour and value. Just remember to bring cash. \"  This was a spot I found when I did the ol \"pho near me\" search on the yelp app. This place came up with great reviews.  Atmosphere  Very casual, small place, but enough tables to host you if you were shopping at T&T or Hillcrest mall and wanted some Vietnamese.  Food  The Pho is simple, yet flavourful. Good clear broth with no MSG-like flavour. Lots of meat in the house special pho. Good sizing too  Value  Under $10 for each menu item. Would be happy to go here again, but they have a sign up front and it's very clear, cash only. So make sure you have cash. They do have an ATM but I mean...come on right? That's why I'm giving this 4/5. Otherwise food is great."}
{"text":"Rushed to the 5:30pm opening, and the restaurant was already full...  we took a number and spent some time at T&T for 30 min before returning to the restaurant.  We ordered a pho (must), rolls with pork (yum) and a vermicelli (omg it's good).  Amazing good, great service, always worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best Viet food in the area, highly recommend the Satay Shrimp Noodle in soup and on the side note, the owner is unbelievably friendly."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Little Saigon. I stumbled upon it while looking for a Vietnamese restaurant that wasn't a chain such as 88 of Train.   We had their vermicelli with lemon grass beef and pho. We were a little disappointed they didn't offer fresh noodles  for the pho like some Vietnamese restaurants, but the broth made up for it! It was very flavourful! The vermicelli was also great, however the fish sauce could use a little more tang."}
{"text":"Not one of best but simply the best Pho in Richmond Hill. Not a big selection Pho restaurant but everything looks enticing. We love their noodle soup, vermicelli, rice & meat plate, spring rolls. I also love the Seafood Tom Yin noodle!"}
{"text":"[ALERT] they take Cash only. There is an ATM machine in the store but there is surcharge on top of the amount you withdraw. Please bring cash."}
{"text":"I met my 3 friends here for lunch.  None of us had ever had Vietnamese food, so we asked our server what he recommended.  We all tried different suggestions off the menu and they were all delicious!  The service was superb and everyone was very kind and friendly, asking us every ten minutes or so if we needed anything.  I highly recommend this wonderful place and we all agreed to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"I had pho. It was thin, very tasty, but a little too salty, but there was way more meat than most Vietnamese restaurants. The service was very friendly and efficient. The price was reasonable - $9 for a large bowl. I would go back if I was in the area and was craving a nice, hot bowl of pho."}
{"text":"lemongrass chicken in sizzling pot -  a total variation of lemongrass chicken  that i've never tried before.   it came in a sauce that was pretty thin, like soup  but was SO flavorful and spicy.   it was perfect to mix with rice.   a solid 5/5 and my absolute favorite thing here  catfish dish (1st on the seafood item list) -  sweet, slightly spicy, the sauce was almost like a glaze also fantastic just .00000000001 behind the lemongrass chicken"}
{"text":"I discovered this place shortly after moving to Glendale and in need of my pho fix. I first tried their pho tai which I wasn't very impressed with. I didn't give up on them though I went back and tried their pho Dac Biet (special pho) and was very impressed. It's my favorite place to get pho Dac Biet in this area. Not only are the portions big the quality of meats is awesome (except for the meatball that goes in, worst meatball ever lol but I don't care much for that), never over cooked and the noodles are always just right. I have also had their pot stickers, egg rolls, and bun thit (vermicelli bowls), all very good.  Don't forget to try their lotus root salad, it's SUPER yummy!"}
{"text":"I truly wanted to love this place! I had the shrimp/pork spring rolls and shrimp/chicken vermicelli salad - both were quite good, with the exception of the rice paper and noodles tasting like they were rehydrated with unfiltered tap water (both had a weird taste). My husband's food, on the other hand, was terrible! He ordered #44 - the rice was extremely dry and chewy, the pork chop tasted ok, but was mostly bone and gristle, and the shredded pork was downright disgusting."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a low price. Finally, a Vietnamese restaurant where the Asian staff speaks English. You can ask a question, and get an answer without a puzzled look, pause, and a smile. A perfect place to expand your experience with Vietnamese food beyond phó."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food and excellent overall experience. Very friendly staff. Warm and clean decor. Will certainly be back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Found this little gem while searching all over for a good place to eat that wasn't a chain. This place did not disappoint me. Everyone was very friendly and the service was great."}
{"text":"We have been here since they opened a few years ago. Food is always good. We usually order the rare beef pho, vermicelli with grilled chicken and springrolls, or lemongrass pork with rice. It is a small restaurant so can get busy during peak hours."}
{"text":"Very good, very fresh!! Was my first visit got pot stickers and beef and shrimp vermicelli, was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Came here completely randomly looking for a light lunch. This was my first experience having pho and it definitely won't be my last. First impression was how clean and neat this place is. We were quickly seated in a nice little booth. Our server, (wish I had gotten his name) was so incredibly sweet and accommodating. When I told him it was my first experience he actually took the time to explain everything off the menu.   Next, we shared the spring rolls (which were to die for!), spicy beef satay pho and a chicken vermicelli, which was all delicious. For next time, I think I will stay with the regular pho instead of the spicy satay. Although it was tasty, not a huge fan of star anise spice, but don't shy away if you are looking for bold flavours!   All in all, food was good and inexpensive, plus the service was really friendly! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Got here at 630 pm they close at 7 pm. This place always closes early. Heads up and call ahead. I ate here once before and it is very good. However they close whenever they feel like it. When we got here the sign said closed before we even entered the place. Thank god there is other Asian restaurants that stick to there hours of schedule."}
{"text":"Finally an evening when my schedule allowed a visit before their closing time. I normally don't make an effort to visit places which close so early but following many satisfied Yelpers including some of my favorite reviewers I was curious to give it a try and was rewarded with a rare  lineup-free immediate seating.  Noticed a difference from the typical \"pho place\" in that Little Saigon is a nice looking and welcoming space to be in. Obviously done on a much smaller budget than newer shops like Pho XIn Chao & The Pho, but with good taste & common sense. The tiny dinning room is very well utilized not to feel cramped even though it's not much bigger than a doctor's  waiting room. Seems to be a family & friends operation, all males, the servers were very courteous and there was a sense of pride and caring about the restaurant (although getting the bill took longer than seemed necessary)   Only two size choices for Pho. I went with the smaller one for $9 with Rare Beef & Tendon, it was comparable to the middle option of places that offer three sizes.  The Beef slices were about average in quantity & quality, sliced thin enough to quickly finish cooking in the  soup to my comfort level. The amount of Tendon was a little more generous than usual, and the chunks were on the firmer side.   Broth was of the \"cleaner\" variety with very minimal oil separation, the color leaned toward a brownish hue (as opposed to greenish).  It smelled like it would be an interesting multi-dimensional broth, but the taste seemed a bit light on seasoning - though by no means bland or weak, it had a strong \"beefy\" character which was satisfying, just in different way than I expected. In my little mixing bowl I tried it with both the Sriracha and the sweet sauce, it definitely paired better with Sriracha, although I chose to eat most of it straight up.  Overall very enjoyable. While it doesn't interrupt  my search for a Pho that blows me away, I wouldn't hesitate to get it again if I ever find myself here on time. I also hope to try the pancake and a very generous looking porkchops/fried eggs & rice combo I saw in the menu."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go to in Glendale! The Pho is the best in town, and the veggie egg roles are to die for! I love this place because it's authentic, has great customer service and always has the freshest Vietnamese in town! I also opt in for the Snoh dessert- we like the strawberry snoh with fresh mango and condensed milk THE BOMB! I suggest this place for the best viet in town!"}
{"text":"Me and family absolutely love this place, they are always super nice and keep up with us their service is outstanding"}
{"text":"This resturant is one of my favorites in the valley. Their pho is the best. Great customer services and wonderful place to bring friends and family."}
{"text":"I ate beef with rice noodle in soup this noontime, taste good and no MSG found! Will visit this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"I am a Pho fan amongst soup fans. I eat Pho 3-4 times a month in SD and PHX. This is quality pho. #9 will do you solid. The staff is friendly. Good pho'ing!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I forgot about this place and I haven't been there for over 8 years. It's definitely cool place with nice atmosphere and super polite waiters, even if you are rude, grumpy character they would still probably be nice to you! I haven't tried much there but what I did try was delicious and fresh, I'm going there today again to explore more stuff and have my Vietnamese coffee (I strongly recommend people who drink espresso ) to try it, it will be mixed with condensed milks so no sugar needed. Also if you are super legal person and care about taxes etc you should avoid this place since they accept only cash."}
{"text":"Always a great and delicious meal aling with good service! Been coming for years and never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Vietnamese restaurants are not traditionally known for their ambiance, but this one really made me feel at home. Although some of the tables are pretty close to each other, it is a very comfortable environment. The dining experience was much nicer than I expected! My favorite Vietnamese dish is the vermicelli bowl with pork, and I also always get spring rolls. The meal here was one very good. It didn't meet up to my all-time favorite (Pho Tau Bay in New Orleans) and I think Da Vang makes it slightly better, but it was very good. The spring rolls were much better than those at the other places I've tried. (Sidenote: Really, how hard is it to make these? How can places like Saigon Nites and Cyclo not make them as good as me? And I'm a Cajun that learned by reading the back of a spring roll wrapper container!) My companion thoroughly enjoyed the boba tea; I didn't think it was worth the money, as it was only so-so. I did enjoy a good Vietnamese beer, but I don't remember what kind it was. Other than the beverages, the prices were reasonable. As mentioned by others, it's hard to find a place to park, but it's definitely a great place to eat (quality and price) if you are in downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"The food is average there but the owner and the waitress were awful. I have been going there since I moved to AZ, three years ago. I always go there with my family, a group of four, and always tip them more than 18%. Last week I had family visiting us and I brought them there for lunch, since we had 13 people, the waitress told us that it was required to add 18% gratuity to the bill, which was fine for us, but they didn't have a table to sit all of us. Instead they separated us among three tables and told us that we couldn't split the bill. One table of my family didn't know that there would be 18% gratuity added and was trying to find out the reasoning from the waitress and the waitress started yelling at my family and the owner came out from the kitchen screaming that \"This is our policy\"! In my opinion, even if this is a policy that the customers should follow, the owner and waitress could have informed us in a polite manner. They should not expect their customers to return if they were treated in a way of unsatisfactory. One should know that there are more than just that one Vietnamese restaurant in Arizona."}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday, got #38. Food was  very good and tasty. Service was great. We will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"\"It's like eating in my own home, except that I get to charge you,\" said one of the operators.   Enough said. Stop reading and savor the delicious life. (Apparently everyone in the Civic Center already knows about it.)"}
{"text":"i drove by that area many times.. and i always thought it was someone's home.. =  ) food is great.. been going there since 2007..  spring roll is great.. peanut sauce.. mmmm...  i usually get ice coffee,  spring roll, and garlic shrimp..  i have tried almost everything on their menu..  few are good.. few are.. so so..   family owned place..  servers are great! love the older man who cooks in the kitchen.. i believe he is the main owner, and his son and wife are the servers..  they are awesome..    i love it when cook gets upset and start yelling!! it is like dinner and show!! =  )    if you like tofu.. try their glazed onion tofu.. it is crispy outside.. and soft inside.. man.. now i am getting hungry!!!  price is fair.. food is awesome.. great service.. perfect winning combo!!"}
{"text":"I've sat and dined here along with take out numerous of times. Take out tastes just as great as dining in.  This restaurant serves authentic Vietnamese style food at its finest. The food is just wonderful. They serve the best Pho I've ever tried, ever."}
{"text":"Coming to Arizona twice from California, we have tried many eateries in this  Phoenix surroundings.  Tonight our family of five decided to eat at Little Saigon and it was a total surprise.  We ordered the traditional Vietnamese food like Lau ca Chua and Banh Hoi.  They were surprisingly delicious.  I tried these foods in so many places in Santa Anna, San Jose, San Francisco and so on but this is my best so far.  From friendly staff, reasonable pricing and the quality of foods, I agreed with the five stars their diners gave them, the write ups from independent publications and the Yelps."}
{"text":"Best Pho in the GTA! I've been to many pho places, and while there's lots of good ones, it's difficult finding authentic ones like they have in Vietnam.  This place is amazing and authentic. The prices are good, food quality is good, the restaurant is very clean, and staff are super friendly too.  My only drawback is they only accept cash, and there's no ATM nearby.  So bring cash.  Hopefully they accept credit/debit cards some day. :-)"}
{"text":"This place was a fantastic find. I spend a lot of time in historic Glendale, and I have passed this restaurant many times. Finally we made our way to Little Saigon, and I couldn't be happier with the experience.  To start with, we has great service. The young lady that waited on us was friendly, knowledgable, and very helpful. She spent time explaining each dish and left me wanting to try a large part of the menu.  She never let my drinks go un-filled.  The food was fantastic! We shared the spring rolls and the sauce was excellent. The pork inside was tender and very flavorful.  I had the #14, rice noodle stew, and it was awesome. The beef was slowly cooked and very tender. It fell apart in my mouth! Very, very well made. It was so big that I had 2 meals worth of leftovers.  My boyfriend had the #48, which was breaded garlic shrimp with caramelized onions. He let me try one and, WOW! This was the best part. It was very hard to resist eating his entire meal.   Nicely done, Little Saigon."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  Its cute and located kinda off the main street in downtown glendale.  Looked like a house turned into a restaurant so thats cool but the food was okay.  Ive had better but maybe its because im comparing it to CA.  Favorite here in Az, at least in phoenix area is still the one off of camelback and 17th believe.  The soup for the beef pho was not very good, too much oil and really not flavorful.  The rice dish was good but small portion.  My bf seemed to enjoy it.  Overall id eat there again if I really wanted pho and my usual spot isnt opened."}
{"text":"Where to even start...YUMMMMMMMY! My husband and I should have a frequent flyer card to Little Saigon we love it so much and could not feel more at home when we go there. John and his family have created the such hidden gem of Glendale in a refurbish home; filled with the aromas of a home cooked vietnamese meal as you walk in the front door.   We try to make it there at least once a week if possible...and we always ask John what to order (he's never steered us wrong)...and to this date we've NEVER had a bad meal....and thats at least 15-20 meals later.   Some of our favorites include the Potsickers (a must have starter), #27 which is a pan fried noodle with light brown sauce meats, chicken shrimp and veggies (AMAZING), the fried rice is out of bounds (and John's dad has now been making it a little spicier with basil...props to the master chef himself...he's outdone even his own masterpiece!). The ginger chicken it great as well as a sirloin dish with green onion (our new found favorite...with a side of 'coleslaw').   I can't say enough great things about Little Saigon....Oh and it's reasonably priced too! But you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! What a surprise to find a little place this good in the Phoenix area. The vermicelli was light and fresh, the curry tasty and slightly spicy, and the Vietnamese coffee just the right amount of sweet. The service was attentive and prompt, and the setting delightful! What more could one ask?"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place today, was so excited with all the stars and posting. So so upset and left without even getting seated. Our names was crossed out and the host state that we left, but we we're there the entire time. Also they seated two other guest on the list. When I confronted him, he didn't even apologize and again said that we left but was called. We then waited for the third table to be cleaned and again hostess called the next guest and skipped us.  So disappointed......never coming back wish I could give them a zero"}
{"text":"Tip: This place is on 57th Avenue, as the address shows. You're driving and starving and you see 58th Ave and you think, \"Yay, 57th is next!\" Well, it IS, but it's 57th DRIVE. Ya gots to go one more block to 57th AVENUE. I wasn't paying attention so we got lost. Oops! :)  Anyway, finally got there and had a good lunch. The place is clean and the folks are nice. We had the Beef Meatballs soup and spring rolls. The food was a little bland for me, but my husband liked it; he's got a new lunch place for when he works in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant was clean, and nice, the service was good. However, stay away from the bun bo hue, it was a disaster. I've never tasted anything so horrible!!! The pho was decent though, I've never tried anything else there. I will probably not come back."}
{"text":"So begins the summer tour of restaurants while the kid is at camp. Nice little Vietnamese place not far from our home.  The special pho bowl in large wasn't as large as some places, however the vermicelli was very generously sized. Delicious, healthy and inexpensive."}
{"text":"I live in Markham, the epicentre of pho and noodle restaurants.  Little Saigon is by far the best.  All of the others don't even come close!!!"}
{"text":"This quaint little restaurant near downtown Glendale has been here for about 3 years, but has a long history in the valley in 2 other locations, including originally in Scottsdale. It is now in a converted house, with a little white picket fence in front. Cute!  There is a large fish tank at the entry, and then there are 2 seperate small dining rooms. Large wood beams go acros the ceilings. A tall, bald Causasian man took my order, but he knew Vietnamese food, and the cook is a little Vietnamese old lady, and she can cook!   This restuarant has all the usual dishes you would find in a place like this, from Pho (noodle soup) to Com (rice plates) to Bun (Rice vermicelli plates).   But I started with the Goi Cuon (spring rolls). 2 of them came on a single order, and were very large! Usually you get just 2 shrimps in each, but they had 3 or 4 shrimp in each! Lotsa veggies and pork, too! Served with a peanut sauce.   Instead of all the typical plates, I also went for one of my favorite appetizers again....Banh Xeo! Banh Xeo is a large crepe/omelet like half-crescent pancake, stuffed with bean sprouts, pork and shrimp, and fried to a crispy shell, sort of like a Dosa in Indian Food. For $6.99, I got two large Banh Xeo! Most places only give you 1, so this is a great deal.   It was tasty and crispy! They served it with the Romaine leaves to wrap up sections of the Banh Xeo into, along with the pickled carrots, daikon (white raddish), cilantro to stuff inside, and the Nuoc Mam (fish sauce) to dip into.   It is really messy to cook Banh Xeo, what with all the dough and frying, and it is perhaps more messy to eat it, as you wrap it in romaine with a bunch of veggies, and dip it into the Nuoc Mam, and then try to make it to your salivating mouth! By the end (I couldn't finish the entire 2), I advise you go wash your hands, or smell like Nuoc Mam for hours later!   PS - they offer Vietnamese 33 beer!"}
{"text":"I have been to the restaurant once . Its a family owned restaurant located in downtown Gledale. My experience has been good. The food is quite awesome.  Food: 4 out of 5 Ambience: 2 out of 5 Service: 3 out of 5"}
{"text":"There was a line up at the door before opening for dinner, so automatically knew this place was popular. Food, service and drinks were fantastic but the price is $1-2 more than what you would find in Toronto. Would definitely come back as the quality was great. Loved how there were fried peanuts and green onions in the vermicelli!"}
{"text":"I give them a two star because the attending lady was rude, we went there yesterday for lunch hour and we were waiting to be seated for at least 15 minutes which in some other places you only wait at least 4 minutes! I wrote our names on the waiting list because I didn't know if they needed a certain name or multiple names to put on the wait list! The lady was yelling out our names and she then said is this a group and I said yes, and she hesitated and said you don't have to do that, but the way she said it she said it like if she was bothered! We waited for another 15 minutes and then she came and we said we are in a bit of a hurry, then she said \"it's not gonna happen!\" And we decided to leave!"}
{"text":"Very clean tucked away oasis in a hot hot parking lot.  You can actually park behind the building and find a bit of shade. We arrived for lunch and were promptly seated and given menus and cold water to drink. The bowl of Pho we ordered was just the right size. Fresh spring roll fresh and served pretty promptly and with a smile. What amazed me was the flavor of the broth and the subtle flavors that hit your palette.  I enjoyed first to last bite. I am looking forward to returning to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Disgusting, I am an avid pho lover searching all over the Phoenix area for the best pho and this place is by far the worst I've had. The broth was greasy, the brisket was harshly over cooked and the tendon and organ meat WAS no clean and tasted horrible. I left with a huge stomach ache. Don't come here!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best pho in the west side. To me the most important part of the pho is the broth - they have the most flavorful broth.  The only one that comes close is Pho Thanh in terms of flavor.  43rd Express is also very good.  Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of good pho places in Phoenix.  I would say that they are the best though.  You cannot go wrong with Little Saigon."}
{"text":"took my parents and brother here and everybody loved it! I've gone back multiple times since then! Great food at great prices!"}
{"text":"Always come here the food is good the service is great! Cathy the server is always so nice and helpful! The beef pho and the spring rolls are my favorite !"}
{"text":"I was around the area so I decided to give it a second try after visiting a year ago. Last time I had the beef and spring roll vermicelli and didn't like the way they made the beef. Now looking at the menu I realized the beef was sautéed while the pork was grilled. I ordered the pork and it came out tasting right and served with plenty of greens. So the grilled pork and spring roll vermicelli would be my recommendation if you're into vermicelli."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the #38  Beef, pork tenderloin, grilled on top of fried rice.   Absolutely awesome!!!!!  You must go here to eat your Vietnamese.   If you haven't tried it. Try it here, you will not be disappointed. We wasn't."}
{"text":"My wife and I have travel over 40 minutes to eat here and we've been here a dozen times. We often take out of town visitors and customers here, like we did tonight.   To start, the server forgot one of our five drinks. One meal was missing a meat. The most annoying thing about our last visit was that they forgot to make my wife's meal and started cooking it after the rest of us had nearly finished our meal, and every other table (seated after us) was served. When the meal finally arrived, everyone else had finished so we asked for the meal to go expecting it to be free because it came out ridiculously late and was clearly forgotten. Instead of an apology we were told that if we wanted the meal we had to pay for it despite it being forgotten and arriving after everyone else had finished.   The service was just bad. Not once did anyone apologize for any of the forgotten items and to argue over a $9 meal with customers who come often and with guests just seems petty. We'll take our guests to one of the many other Vietnamese establishments in the valley from now on.    Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Wonderful Vietnamese food. I just ordered some take out for me and a co-worker, our first try of this little restaurant. I ordered the Ga Xao Xa Ot, which was so rich and full of flavor. When I picked up our food, the restaurant was packed with a waiting list at 11:30, obviously a very popular place to dine for lunch. I will definitely go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"If you want to taste the Vietnamese's foods, it's bad. Waiting to get the menu, waiting for food and waiting for the the bill. Each time, I have to wait about 30 minutes in order tmto get it. People after us got their food.   I was there with a friend, enjoy to introduce a new restaurant to my friend: we got very disappointed. The pho did not get enough the basilic, neither the fresh one or the meat one. For the fried spring rolls, I had to ask the salad in order to roll it with."}
{"text":"I am so happy with this spot. The only thing missing for me is the Bahn Mi. Loved the spring rolls the pork is seasoned and grilled not boiled. This gives the roll a different taste. A very delicious taste. Shrimp was cooked perfectly not chewy. Peanut sauce is on point. I could eat just this for lunch and be satisfied. I did order the beef pho and enjoyed every drop of it. The broth is not not as aromatic as I am used to so maybe a first time pho eater would take to it. I like that it does come out piping hot which makes the first sip of broth just run through your soul. And that is an amazing feeling. Warms the tummy. The resteraunt is clean an cozy. Our waitress was very nice and extremely helpful. There is seating outside too. I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our preferred pho place in PHX. Delicious broths and lots of choices make for a fun time at lunch or dinner. Speedy service means we are never late for Yotes puck drop!"}
{"text":"Love their food and it's a quaint location inside and out.  Have been many times and always enjoyed the food and service."}
{"text":"I have to say that I have been coming to Little Saigon for years, but never reviewed it?!?  We came down here during Glitter n Glow and now my mind ifs refreshed on how great it was!   First off I love the location and the old restored house where the restaurant is made into. The service has always been good. It's a very nice and quaint feeling instantly when you walk in.   I've tried several items but my personal favorite is the catfish in the black pepper pot with a side of white rice. I've must have had this at least 10 times and I wish I could have it more!! The pepper sauce is amazing and the catfish is tasty.   I've also had the pho and it was also very good.   All in all Little Saigon is one of if not best Vietnamese restaurant in the valley. My personal favorite. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I grew up in Glendale and never heard of this place! I'm so glad somebody told me it was there. Cute Place tucked away in the heart of Glendale with a traditional Vietnamese menu. I love the hot pot soups especially when I'm feeling under the weather."}
{"text":"I've been to Little Saigon many times and I find that they are always busy, even if I visit during \"off peak\" hours. The food is tasty enough that I don't mind the 5-15 minute wait for a table.   The deep-fried spring rolls are delicious and a generous size as well. I think they fry them to order (as I've never had them in any state other than piping hot and crispy). I find their pho broth to be mild-yet-flavorful and non-greasy, which is nice. I like the fresh herbs (with minimal brown spots) and non-soggy sprouts for pho- it's rare to find a place that gives consistently fresh herbs and sprouts for their pho.   The customer service is fast-paced but very friendly, I've never had a bad experience with anyone being rude. Will continue to come back when I have a craving for Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best pho I've had in the GTA. The broth is flavorful but light (you can really taste the layers of flavors), the toppings are beautifully layered on top of the noodles (the beef balls are one of the best I've had, it's got the perfect bite), the condiments are plentiful and fresh, and the noodles are cooked just perfectly. No wonder there's always a line!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Pho but I've had better; I've definitely had worse also. I also tried the shrimp spring roll, it is was decent also."}
{"text":"Wow I'm so sad to do this review as I have been coming here for years and years. Sadly today I was not impressed. We ordered spring rolls and the meat that was inside was really hard like it was old meat, then we get our dishes I ordered a won ton soup my husband had a beef and potatoes pho, talk about completely being flavorless I mean nothing at all just like water. Our service wasn't good either. So disappointed especially since this isn't too close to where I live."}
{"text":"Awesome little place, great service, good food, actual asians, no annoying music, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I went to little saigon with my buddy and literally had an orgasm because it was so good"}
{"text":"My first Pho! I never understood why you see the food network people get all excited as they describe the pho they are eating and the layers of flavor... now I GET IT! AWESOME! I love pho! The spring rolls are spectacular too! The servers are very helpful when you are ordering, taking the time to explain everything!"}
{"text":"What a great little find. Charming restaurant in a cute neighborhood. From the outside it reminded us of coffee shops that we've visited in Saigon. Inside it's just as charming, as it appears to be an old house turned into a restaurant.  A couple things threw us off - wait to be seated, but put your name on the clipboard. Second - large fish in the fish tank that reads \"These fish are our friends, not food\"  Anyway on to the menu - great selection of various dishes. Prices are a $1 or $2 more than other Vietnamese places we've tried to far in Phoenix - I'll give that to the area. My wife had a grilled chicken and rice dish, which she absolutely loved. Dark thigh meat chicken (it's flavorful and moist - no chicken breast here) and a lot of it. Standard rice, tomato and cucumber with fish sauce.   I chose to have an egg noodle soup (mì sui co #20) with sliced pork, pork belly (small cubes of pork belly I believe), wontons and ground pork. Also had bok choy. Great flavorful broth that really hit the spot.   Staff was friendly if not a little overwhelmed - place was busy but not slammed and the two younger people working the tables seemed like they were struggling to keep up. We still felt well attended to. Five stars all the way for great food, great ambiance and fair prices. Will be going back before we leave town."}
{"text":"So this is going to sound super cheesy but it's been a looong time since food had made me smile! I had the spicy chicken w/veggies in a lemongrass/fish sauce. (#51 on the menu). I took my first bite and instantly smiled... My daughter asked, \"what's so funny\" I responded with \"nothing, this food is just that good that it made me happy\". This was my first time here but def not my last!"}
{"text":"Had to drop 1 of my 4 kids off to a birthday party at the nearby LaserQuest (yes I got FOUR kids!) so decided to have dinner with the rest of them at Little Saigon.  In my opinion Pho places are one of the best bang for your buck to feed large families.  Have a lot of mouths to feed and need to feed them cheap?  Don't have Mickey D's, have some Pho I say!  Run by a Vietnamese family, the pho here is rich, smooth and flavourful.  The noodle texture was done really well with the meat tender and flavourful.    The only negative I can say was that the portions were a little on the small side compared to most places.  Also the menu is very small in size and selection.  On a side note the fried spring rolls were fantastic and probably one of the best ones that I have in a long time so do yourself a favour and order a plate.  The place is small so do expect a wait if you come during dinner or lunch rush.  Service was very friendly for an Asian restaurant which is always a positive in my books.  So what's my decision?  \"Pho outta Phive!\""}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!  We love the staff, the food, everything about it.  I wouldn't suggest getting take out here though.  They charge an additional fee for it.  Its not the cheapest place and I don't complain because everything I have eaten here is wonderful, but I do stop at the \"to go\" charge.  Its makes your meal quite spendy.   My favorites?  Vermicelli beef and shrimp salad and the Pho of course.  Their pork and shrimp spring rolls are to die for.  Best I have had so far at any Vietnamese place I have eaten at."}
{"text":"Was looking for a decent pho place in Richmond Hill and thanks to the Yelp reviews I tried this place last night and loved it!  Hubby and I had the deep fried rolls for $4 and a large bowl of pho for $9. The broth in the pho was so clear and tasty. The hot tea was just right. I think it is the first time we finished all the broth. I think next time since we were sharing a bowl, we will pay for more beef in the pho. The place is clean and well kept and the staff looks happy to work there unlike some other pho places where the staff looks like they would rather be somewhere else. It is cash only. There is an ATM right by the cash register if you forget your cash. There is no problem parking as it is a big plaza with T&T.  Next time we will try some rice or vermicelli dishes. They do takeout as a couple of people came in and ordered some rice dishes to go."}
{"text":"Quaint little Vietnamese restaurant with quite the extensive menu, delicious flavors,  and welcoming staff. Worth going back when I'm in the area for sure. Not a bad thing at all from my experience. Portions are good. Dessert was delicious (Friend Bananas with Ice Cream). 5/5"}
{"text":"The food was great. I went on a Friday at lunchtime and the place was full. I had to wait about 10 minutes. It was totally worth it. I had the potstickers which were great. They tasted like they were made in house. I also had #23. h tiu xào thp cm / flat rice noodles with beef, pork, chicken & vegetables. It was similar to chow fun if you have had that before. The flavor was very good. The meat was tasty and all the veggies were fresh and crisp. The noodles were just right. Everything was well balanced. I have had the pho and spring rolls before and they were great as well. If you like asian food you should add Little Saigon into your rotation. It provides different flavors than Grand Dragon or Siamese Kitchen the Chinese and Thai restaurants I love on the west side. I can't wait to go back and try some other items."}
{"text":"We have been here twice.  Had #30 and my husband had #51. Both were very good. Service is good and friendly. Very popular place it seems and for good reason."}
{"text":"Flavour? Yes. Worth Lining Up For? No.  Little Saigon took over from another Vietnamese restaurant in the same location and is quite good. While the broth of the pho is not the best in the GTA it is quite good, flavourful and has some depth. The portions are generous and the Medium - there is also Large - would suffice for most people. The menu is limited compared to most Vietnamese restaurants, but all the staples are present. I had the house pho which has good broth, beef and noodles. The vegetables and bean sprouts were fresh of course (see below: line-up). The spring rolls, however, were disappointing in that they were quite soggy and oily.  The restaurant is packed and there is a line-up. It may be the sheep effect that makes people stand in line because there is already a line there because the food is not that good, but it is certainly above average. Tai Bac across the street is as competent, larger and has no line-up. Little Saigon hands out numbers at the door and we had to wait 30 minutes for a seat.  The service is polite and prompt and one cannot fault them in any way. The restaurant is cash-only. The premises appear clean.  As much as the food is good this may be my last time here. Little Saigon and I do not have the same relationship as Chinese-Canadian friends and authentic Japanese businesses opening in town (Uncle Tetsu as one example)!"}
{"text":"The best of the best of the best can't say enough good thing about this place owners are super nice and great service .. I'd come here everyday if I could"}
{"text":"Tip:  CASH ONLY!  As far as Vietnamese places are concerned, this place is fairly new, clean, and fresh!  My +2s and I were on our way to Yelp GTA Rocks, when we decided to stop in for a quick meal.  What were we thinking??  (Maybe it was just Kris U's email echoing in my mind, but I really didn't expect to eat an entire meal at the Yelp event.  Boy, was I wrong!)  I love stopping by new restaurants 'cause they're always eager to please as with the case with Little Saigon.  Basil/bean sprouts were fresh and abundant.  Broth for pho was clear and didn't taste as though it was from the previous days...you know what I'm talkin' about!    My only criticisms were that:  1)  somewhat pricey for a pho place, $7 for a regular size which was a good sized portion and 2)  friend ordered the Lemongrass Spicy Chicken with Rice and it wasn't all that spicy and the large slices of white onion almost outnumbered the pieces of chicken.  So they could work on the ratio.  Decent place for pho if you're in the area though!  Server was kind and attentive."}
{"text":"I've tried all kinds of pho places in the GTA, but none of them beat the pho here at Little Saigon. The soup is very flavourful, unlike the bland tasteless soup you'll find at other pho restaurants.  The restaurant itself is very clean and the service is decent. Definitely will be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Little Saigon is a small restaurant in Glendale hidden north of Glendale ave on 57th avenue. Lets begin with cleanliness; floors were spotless and the restroom was very clean. The waitress was very friendly and took the time to explain the menu which was both in english and vietnamese.      I ordered the number 37 which is a pork and beef dinner with fried rice and  small salad. The plate was amazing and delivered promptly. Food was fresh and delicious.  A home run thx"}
{"text":"I am an avid fan of Vietnamese Rice Noodle... I can eat this noodle soup everyday! At least once a week or more, I go to Pho602, or the one near in Bethany Home Rd. and 43rd Ave. in Phoenix. Being said so... I am very familiar how it should look like, and what are the stuff I should expect in my Vietnamese Rice Noodle. My wife and I decided to eat in LITTLE SAIGON in Down Town Glendale, AZ for a Rice Noodle and Fried Noodle. PROS: 1. The place is clean. 2. The servers are very welcoming. 3. Quick Service.  CONS: 1. The first thing that you will see in the entrance is the FILTY AQUARIUM that if you look into it, you will lose your appetite right away... (Too bad, I love aquariums and I know the difference between clean and filthy aquarium)  2. I was expecting a lot in my Rice Noodle bowl since it is more expensive than Pho602. It was $9, so this young lady bringing it from the kitchen, from a far I was so happy because it was HUGE BOWL, but when she put it in the table, IT CONTENTS ONLY HALF OF THE BOWL! NO TRIPE, MEATBALLS ONLY 2 PIEACES, RICE NOODLE NOT ENOUGH, BEEF SMALL AMOUNT COMPARED TO Pho602 and the one near Bethany and 43rd Ave. When you order XL it is really XL and you can expect so much stuff inside your bowl! Tripe, beef meat, beef ligament, lots of noodle to enjoy for only $7.50!  3. My wife ordered fried noodle and it was $10, so I was expecting something really good, like amount wife and ingredients will be more. But unfortunately, IT WAS TOO DRY, THEY JUST BASICALLY PUT LOTS OF VEGETABLE, NOT THAT MUCH OF MEAT.  IF YOU WANT TO GET A QUALITY VIETNAMESE FOOD FOR THE PRICE YOU ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR, SAVE YOUR SELF FROM THIS PLACE AND DRIVE FEW MILES AND GO TO PHO 602 or the one near Bethany Home Village and 43rd Ave."}
{"text":"Came in today for a quick lunch and was craving something spicy as well. As I was walking in I noticed it was cash only. I was seated after making sure I had enough cash to pay for lunch.  I ordered the Tom Yum noodle soup with shrimp. It was delicious, fresh, and had the perfect amount of spice. The restaurant looked clean as well, and my server was kind and attentive. I gave it 4 stars because they should accept another method of payment aside from cash. Aside from this I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The best Vietnamese I have had in Arizona. The house fried rice is a great safe bet if you are trying Vietnamese for the first time. I like the pho, fresh spring rolls and noodle bowls. The side veggies they serve for the pho and noodles are always fresh. I have had their fried spring rolls too but I prefer the fresh only because of their delicious peanut sauce for dipping."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Down from Sacramento for Spring Training and felt like a little Pho, which is plentiful in Sactown. This place was quaint, in an old house. Little rooms of tables. Fast service! We started with the pot stickers, which were homemade and fresh. Very tasty. the Pho was great, too. The nice lady who took our order was very great. My spousal equivalent is not a fan of fish. When he ordered a noodle dish that sounded tasty, she gave us a heads up that is has a strong flavor of fish sauce. Tragedy averted; he ordered something else. I could not finish my noodles and a take-out dish was promptly offered. Very pleased with our dinner; give it a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, adorable restaurant. Very small and cozy. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't know this place existed. Great service, and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly when we go! My favorite place in Arizona to go get phó! It brings back childhood memories. Their phó is very spot on and I love everything about this little place."}
{"text":"Three of us went to Little Saigon yesterday. I had the curry chicken & my wife & brother-in-law had fish. Plus we all had spring rolls. The food was fabulous & the service was terrific! Will go back, hopefully soon, even though we live in Sun City."}
{"text":"It's PHOOOO time   My boyfriend and his friends picked this location for a  kid friendly lunch get together. Although the place was packed, the service was so good that we were able to get a table for 8 people very quickly. My boyfriend ordered a large rare beef & beef brisket pho and I order cold noodles with a spring roll, grilled chicken and pork. We wanted an avocado shake but unfortunately the blender was broken...so we got a Viet iced coffee instead. The food came very fast and the servers were very attentive with giving us extra bowls, a booster and asking if our food was good.   The pho bowls were fairly big and the soup base was delicious. My cold noodles was definitely fresh and tasty. It was filled with herbs, veggies - lettuce, cucumber and pickled carrots. The spring roll was nice, fresh & crispy!!! But WOW....  either I'm a weak coffee drinker but I found the Viet coffee strong, which is great because it gave a great energy boost.  If you'd ask me, this would be my next go to pho place in the area. The food was fresh and taste. The service was amazing and not to mention there was a huge line the whole time we were eating.  Tips: they take cash only, so make sure u come prepared.  If you haven't tried this place, I would highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Yay! A really neat cottage looking Vietnamese restaurant in Glendale. Thank you Yelp for this little golden nugget :)  I ordered the fresh spring rolls and was so impressed. Sometimes the outside wrapper tends to be chewy and tough but this one was definitely freshly made. Delicious!   I also got the chicken pho. Loved the broth and the fresh veggies that came with it for garnish. I enjoyed my meal thoroughly. Can't wait to come back and try some other dishes I saw other patrons get. It looked delightful and they appeared to all be very satisfied.  Service is quick and friendly. Facilities are clean. Street parking right in front is nice :)"}
{"text":"Little Saigon has been my alternate choice for my Vietnamese food fix for some time. My first choice has been Phò Thanh, due how close it is, and the value. But Little Saigon's humble abode offers the best Bowl in the west side, and possibly in Arizona.   Their egg rolls are simple and small, but packed with flavor. And the fact that they do offer boba tea and an abundance of classic dishes should please any patron.  Now for the important part, the soup. There is only one size available, but it is the perfect amount. The shrimp was large enough and also detailed. The meat was also pretty big and cooked perfectly. The taste was so excellent.  Not only was the food wonderful, but the service is more than friendly and helpful to all of our requests. We have not had a bad meal here, and come here whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing hidden gem I am so happy to find good pho and cold noodles out here I will definitely keep coming back"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place today, mostly by chance, but it ended up being a good experience and definitely good food.   Tucked away in old town Glendale, this place is a little off the beaten path (it's not on the main drag) but not too far. It's nestled in a nice area set back slightly from the street, so you get less noise than the other places along the main drag (Glendale avenue). What stands out immediately though is the decor and the ambiance of the place. There's a large aquarium in the foyer with beautiful fish, and ornate wood floors and wall siding. The restaurant has several sections that are divided off with narrow door ways, to give a bit of privacy to different groups and, I suspect, keep the noise level down. The tables are also spread apart a bit, which has the same kind of effect. There's definitely much less noise pollution when you're dining with your guests, something that is hard to achieve in most restaurant settings. You legitimately feel like you're somewhere else and not the middle of the Arizona desert when step inside this restaurant.   Our group was immediately seated at a large table and our server was very helpful and patient with us, as we were all unfamiliar with much of the menu offerings. That's actually one thing that I would nitpick about, the menu has nearly 100 items on it and it can be a bit daunting for the uninitiated. With so many options, it's a serious mental exercise to balance the choices and figure out what sounds most appetizing. Our first challenge was the appetizer and following the server's recommendation, we tried the spring rolls and the egg rolls, all of which were fantastic, and quickly devoured. Everything was very well made and the spring rolls were fresh, crisp and simply mouth watering.   Our main entrees were pretty diverse, including the crispy noodles and a couple of their soups (including catfish) but everyone enjoyed their food. The crispy noodles were delicious and I especially liked how they wicked up the moisture from the juices in the bowl and softened up, so that you'd get a contrast between crunchy and regular noodles to go with the vegetables and meat (chicken and beef, in my case).   Service was fairly prompt, even though they were busy with the Friday lunch crowd and had fewer staff than I would have expected. Food service was also quick, with our meals coming out right on time as we polished off the appetizers.   Definitely a place I'd like to go back to, because there's just so much of the menu to explore and so many different things to try. Really glad I got a chance to try this place out!"}
{"text":"What happened!? So disappointed. Theres been a steady decline in flavor, portion size, and missing menu items. Pho portions have been getting smaller and smaller with less protein and noodles and they never have the coconut water or banana dessert when we try to order it. If you order any dish with meat they will literally put like 3-4 slivers on your plate and pour on the veggies to make it look like more. I want my moneys worth! Pho broth is not as flavorful anymore either, seems like theyre not putting as much time into it. I dont know if its a new owner or theyre trying to cut costs but theyre one more bad dining experience away from losing us as customer forever. At least theyre spring rolls are still amazing..."}
{"text":"Why I didn't find this gem a long time ago seems to really amuse me. Came here with my sister, while in my pho moods. I have really been struggling to find some really good pho out here in Arizona. Side note I moved out here from la (aka: city with the best foods) and I have been missing a good bowl of pho!  Ordered the chicken pho, veggie egg rolls, and dessert! I have to admit this was probably the best pho I have had In Arizona. Very quick authentic the broth was made to perfection. My mouth is literally watering just thinking about it. Lol    If you're a pho addict/lover/enthusiast you have to stop by here and try a bowl! I promise you won't regret it! Customer service is great our waitress was very helpful and attentive. Menus are to the point short and sweet just how I like them lol"}
{"text":"Allright, this a review based on my SECOND visit to LS.  The first visit was about 2 years ago when LS was first getting into their new digs in Old Town Glendale.  Needless to say both visits were positive, but my second visit was a close encouter of the delicious kind.  I ordered the Pho to go (yo) cause I'm a slave monkey for my company and not allowed to take a \"lunch hour\"   I tell the waiter \"extra meat for a buck please\" .  Not only does he NOT forget this like I figured he would,  he separates the meat into it's own little lifeboat so it doesn't cook itself to leather in da broth.  Massive, massive shibby my man.    And such extra meat he gave! (in a very hetero way I assure you).  This was one of the only times I couldn'y finish my Pho off.  Usually I'm bitching and moaning like a 4 year old on ADD meds, but this time I was supremely satisfied and not dissapointed in the carne content of my soup.    Rock on Saigon.  Charlie has definetly secured this area."}
{"text":"Good Afternooooon, Vietnam!  Did somebody say lunch time?  Somewhere I heard someone say something about some food.  What a pleasant surprise this Little Saigon is. Nice openness - little rooms with big tables. The atmosphere was comfortable with a capital C - from seating, ordering, eating, to asking questions about the menu. I even felt comfortable being the typical annoying customer.   Our servers were very kind and pleasantly accommodating. They informed the vegetarians in our party of chicken stock in the soup broth. Did we care?   -- begin moment of silence -- ...thinking of the chickens who gave their lives. Uhhhh...a little animal flesh and blood never hurt nobody.   -- end moment of silence --  Soup! Soup! Soup! Soup!  Food was tasty and plentiful. We ordered a multitude of items like three appetizers, boba, fried rice, tofu, veggies, spinach and onions, and a curry dish. Here were my personal choices:  1. Deep fried vegetarian egg rolls ($6) - six small crispy rolls accompanied by romaine leaves, parsley, mint, slices of cucumber and carrot. The rolls have tofu inside. I found one cube of it in each roll that was easily picked out with chop sticks.  2. Lotus root salad ($7) - sans pork. Tasty marinated lotus root and veggies served with four crunchy shrimp flavored rice chips on the side. Lotus is easily identifiable by sight, but its taste blended with the other veggies. The texture of it though is also unique. It reminded me of bamboo slices that get served in chow mein.  3. Bok choy soup w/ginger and onions ($8) - served in large bowl. Very good broth, close to a quart with dark green bok choy and few pieces of ginger and onion. The veggies alone would not be filling, but if you drink all the broth, you'd be full for the next hour or so.  4. Eggplant with onions and veggies ($8) - ordered spicy. It was good, but was not as spicy as I hoped. Took home leftovers.  I definitely recommend this restaurant to any vegetarian looking to try Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Never disappoints.. Today I had a work lunch and ordered the appetizer #2 Goi Cuon.. (Grilled pork, shrimp, and vegetable spring rolls) a Vietnamese iced coffee, and for my entree I can haz #39 Com Dac Biet So 2 (grilled pork tenderloin and beef with fried vegetable rice) instead of the eggroll I asked for a fried egg.. It was all amazing. And the selection of condiments such as hoisin, sriracha, and chili paste can make it even more flavorful."}
{"text":"I reviewed Little Saigon once before but I have to again. This place is seriously the best kept secret in the valley. The service is superb. The Vietnamese cuisine is so good here too; it's incredible. My family and I recently went to Disneyland and stopped off in the actual \"little Saigon\" in Garden Grove California and ate at a couple of restaurants there. The food from Little Saigon here in Glendale was hands down better and the menu is more extensive. They offer far more selection than your average Vietnamese place. Also the spring rolls are about the best I've ever had. Try them and tell me I'm wrong. The Pho is always awesome. Get the #12 it has all the delicious bits you want! The vermicelli salads are perfect for a quick lunch or for an after dinner midnight snack (I usually order one to go after our meal, I'm fat, we like to eat, don't judge me). The crispy crepe is on another level of deliciousness. Packed full of mint, shrimp, pork, bean sprouts, served with daikon, carrot, lettuce, and sweet fish sauce. Roll it up in the lettuce, dip it in the fish sauce, and punch your ticket to flavor heaven. I will warn you this appetizer is the equivalent of crack cocaine. You will have to have more. You will find yourself driving not of your own accord to get your Vietnamese fix and it will begin with you mainlining some crepes and spring rolls. I'm an addict too so I know..."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place!   We had their pho and it was delicious! Everything we saw other people get looked delicious as well and we can't wait to go back to try other things! (Total run on sentence, I know. lol)"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The outside is nice and romantic full of lights and an overall great loose vibe. The food is awesome too and the prices aren't too bad. I will definitely come back and bring friends!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to get, but the hostess helped me out. The veggie fried spring rolls are to die for and the 23, 51, & 54 were oh so very good as well. Everything seemed fresh. Will be going back"}
{"text":"I love when I get brave enough to try new cuisines, and then they turn out amazing. Little Saigon, a little house I've overlooked for years, delivers in flavor, value, and probably nutrition.   The vegetables are that good.   I started off with my very first banh xeo, a crunchy crepe filled with bean sprouts and some shrimp. Unlike French crepes that you can simply dig into, this dish will crumble as soon as you touch it. Use it as filling for a lettuce wrap, and if you're quirky like myself, enjoy the liberal portions of fresh mint and carrots that come along with it. It's still weird to me, but I'd eat it again.   My main course was some beef over bok choi, which was prepared perfectly. I have never had bok choi this tasty, and I'd definitely recommend it. I think it's the number 57, which shows you how many options they have.   For dessert, I went with a taro boba. It was way sweeter than I'm used to...but hey, it's a dessert, so what could I expect? Overall, I was satisfied with a very affordable meal in a clean, stylish environment. I would totes come back."}
{"text":"We drive 22 miles from Goodyear to enjoy the food and service here.  This is the best. Great Vietnamese food at a fantastic value. Staff is so warm and welcoming. Great find."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese food in all of the Phoenix metro area!  The staff are always courteous, polite and fun too.  I definitely recommend the vegetarian spring rolls - excellent."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my colleague. And it was not disappointing. The pho had good portion and they were not greedy with the meat. Service was great as well. Strongly recommend their spring rolls, tons of ingredients and well worth it."}
{"text":"We came here on Tuesday around 7PM. Place was full, we had to wait around 10 minutes which was not too bad. Interior is nice and modern, everything is clean and well taken care of. Now if only the food would have been at the same level that would be great, however my pho's soup base was tasteless. Also dish would benefit from more rare beef, which was of an average quality.   All in all - adequate food for the price, good speedy service but sadly nothing spectacular/outstanding."}
{"text":"Great place for pho! The broth is fragrant and the place is clean. Two regrets are cash only and a limited menu."}
{"text":"I went this restaurant after reading from Yelp even tho it is kind of far from me.  The food was good, but what I like more about this place was the atmosphere.  It made me feel like I am in Vietnam. I liked that. Honestly I am not sure about the taste. I didn't feel really special but I liked it because I like Vietnamese food anyway!"}
{"text":"I ran here on a whim last weekend because I was in the area and it was recommended to me by a friend, so glad I did. I ordered the #38 with a chicken substitute instead of the pork and it was pretty tasty, the fried rice was excellent, the meat was tender and marinated just right, even the egg roll was good. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food!  Very charming atmosphere, great service. This place is located in old, small house converted to restaurant. They also have great outside area, unfortunately it seems they don't use it. Its always packed but wait times are not long.   We are going there very often and food taste amazing every time,  service is great every time. If you would like to experience absolutely awesome food in charming atmosphere this is the place to go. And I guarantee -  you will be back soon."}
{"text":"Best PHO in ARIZONA. sooo fresh and sooo good. Service is amazing and so are other dishes. I was very surprised with their taro bubble tea as well- fresh taro instead of powder..say what??!"}
{"text":"Pho was very good. Huge portion, like normal, so you could share. I got the shrimp and chicken rice plate. The chicken was tender and soft, but also well cooked. Nice sweet flavor."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time today. I'll be back! Started with the hot jasmine tea. Then the pot stickers which were piping hot and really flavorful, we wound up getting a second order they were so good .  My entree was number 26 pan fried flat rice noodles with beef pork and chicken . I added shrimp for $2 more.  The brown sauce was really tasty and the veggies were crisp and perfect ."}
{"text":"Visited this place a couple times and I'm always pleased with the food. We went about 30 min before they closed, so we had to order quick. We were pretty much in and out. Our server was very sweet and took care of us well. I also enjoyed seeing the outdoor lights hanging out on the patio, it brings more charm to the charming little restaurant/house. We will surely visit again."}
{"text":"I've been so many places and this one is not bad at all! No need to go downtown anymore."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in the valley!!! The waitress is so sweet and will remember you. Food is flawless, average price for Vietnamese food, not too pricey, cozy atmosphere, quick and hot. Definitely a regular now."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  Great service.  Atmosphere is relaxing.The food is prepared fresh and served hot."}
{"text":"i love it here!! Simply an amazing hide away place that doesn't attract too many people. It's nice and roomy inside, adorned with a fish tank that my son loves! The service is great, never had any problems with them before. Loyal customer!  Recommend for sure! Always get the house fried rice! Personal favorite!!"}
{"text":"We went there one Sunday noon with a party of 20. I have to say, with the short staff that they had that day, they performed admirably. This is the 3rd time we've been there and they never fail us. We ordered different kinds of entrees from Bun Cha, Com Dia, Pho, and multiple orders of Cha Gio and Goi Cuon. My brother-in-law ordered the house fried rice for two young boys with us, and of course the adults had to try it first (to make sure it was good... lol). And, indeed it was. The kids also ordered a bunch of fresh coconut and they enjoyed it very much. When you go to a Vietnamese restaurant, don't just settle for the Pho. Try other things. This is the place to do it."}
{"text":"Delicious pho, and I'm one to always order the same thing, but every time I eat here I try something new. There's a lot of options and all of them so far have been awesome! The hot pot soup is an excellent choice for something different if you generally like pho and want to try something new. The service is fast and friendly. A must in Glendale!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I have been here twice already within a week and I love it.  Fresh, hot, spicy if you want and very delicious.  I had a #23 (Mi Cao Lau), #5 (Banh Khot), a Sing Ha and finished with fried bananas with vanilla ice cream.  Loved it!  Especially the fried bananas!  So crispy on the outside and moist on the inside...best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Such great food for such awesome prices !!! First time there with my mother and I, and we both loved out experience and waitress"}
{"text":"The pho here is amazing. I suggest for newbies dont get any pho with the meat balls, it can be weird. Sometimes it takes a minute to be seated, but its a family owned restaurant, not McDonalds, so dont expect drive thru time. Always a good choice in downtown Glendale, and soooo recommended!! Do it! Go get some pho!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pho in the GTA. From their traditional rare beed pho, to their lemongrass beef vermicelli, every meal is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch.  Service was good ...my food choices not so much.   The potstickers (pan fried) looked amazing but didn't have any flavor.  The filling was white and stringy...perhaps chicken? Hard to say, likely boiled and lacking any ginger or other spices. Seriously no flavor.   The pho. Ordered the beef combo (#11 I think). Again...this dish also lacked flavor. Regarding the broth, it  had a watered down flavor.  The tendon had a strange almost sour taste.   Was surprised with all the great reviews...but in reviewing them again, it appears Pho is the thing to avoid."}
{"text":"This was our first time Having Vietnamese food and it was very good. We had potstickers as an appetizer and two different kinds of pho. Our bill was less than 20 dollars. Great value. The restaurant looks to be a converted house, so you're eating very close to the other guests and felt like you had to talk quietly. I will go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  2nd time here.  Had to wait quite awhile for 4 of us to be seated.  Hot inside.  104 today.  Nice people.  Again - excellent food."}
{"text":"I was thinking this place would be really good with all of the reviews, but I wasn't really impressed. I ordered the shrimp and steak noodle bowl. The shrimp was Ok, the steak was very chewy and a little bland. It came with a salad and some weird smellling dressing, so I skipped in the dressing. I actually liked the salad by itself and I think it had some green papya in it??? The Thai iced tea was really good though. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing? I don't know or maybe I don't like Vietnamese food? Anyway, and the customer service was mediocre so I more than likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great location!, was timely and good! Why does yelp make me write so much"}
{"text":"Cute little Vietnamese restaurant in downtown Glendale. The food was good/decent. I liked my bun. The pork was flavorful.   The portions were nice. My egg rolls and the snow was ok. I probably wouldn't get next time just because it's not as good as others that I've had. But I'd definitely come back to try more things!  It is a bit pricier than other Viet restaurants."}
{"text":"Great little pho shop. The broth is light but delicious and tasted like it was made from scratch.  We also had the Vietnamese coffee which had a little too much condensed milk for my liking but the coffee was rich and flavourful.   Finally the atmosphere of the restaurant is great as it is clean, well decorated and very cozy.  The staff were attentive and friendly.   If they had a little more Dishes on the menu I would give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"After a fairly miserable first experience at Little Saigon, I was hesitant to go back, but because I know so many people who hold it in such high regard, I've been back several times. It grows on me a little bit every time and I realized that ever since I haven't seen the bad server I had the first time, I've really liked it!  They do fantastic spring rolls, with a tasty peanut sauce and the presentation is much nicer than usual. Bun Cha and Pho Tai are two dishes I've had there multiple times and was really impressed. Cold, fresh veggies, quality ingredients, and great taste.   This is a family run business and it really shows with the pride they take in getting to know their customers, and efficient friendly service. The restaurant, being in a home, has a certain charm that I'm used to downtown and really appreciate. This isn't my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town, but it's up there with the best. I wish their prices weren't so high. They are at least a dollar more per item than anyone else."}
{"text":"Great veitnamese food! Obviously they have some great pho but the spring rolls and vermicelli always hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat fresh food and relax.The Curry,Spring Rolls, Pot-Stickers and Vermicelli noodles and pork is outstanding .We have been customers for 11 years now"}
{"text":"Came here to grab dinner with Cali friends before they head back home. I ordered their hot pot sweet and tangy soup with catfish. It was a perfect marriage of sweetness & tangy-ness with tomatoes, okra, celery, pineapple, bean sprouts, and herbs/spices. My bf and gf got pho. They said it was pretty good. Another friend got vermicelli noodles with grilled pork and egg rolls. He ate all of it with a smile on his face so I'm assuming it was good. Lol. I also ordered the Che ba mau (3 flavors dessert drink) and that was good too. The service was awesome as well.  Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good pho in Glendale glitters! If you're downtown Glendale if you're looking to get some soup this is a good place to pop into. I do recommend them  I give them 1 thumb up. The only thing I didn't like about them was that they did not give enough  beef. So if you do order from this place they give below average on the beef so you might want to ask them for extra"}
{"text":"If it were closer to home I would give it a second go, but it's just too far, and was too mediocre for the drive.  I got one of their \"Pho\" dishes, turkey, ham and beef.  The meat seemed of very low quality, actually made me wish I would have gone veggie.  The spring rolls were alright, but nothing I will be writing home to Mom about. They do have a cool fish tank, which almost bumped them to a 3 star'r."}
{"text":"Awesome Vietnamese in downtown Glendale. Normally when we go here it's for spring rolls and Banh Xep (rice flour crepe with shrimp pork and bean sprouts )always, sometimes pho and sometimes one of their delicious vermicelli salad bowls with chicken or pork. They always have fresh fixings with everything like mint, basil, cilantro and the jalapeños (with the pho)for all the dishes we get. Pho is huge and hot as hell and we are sweating and full when done. Everything has so many different flavors and textures and I love the variety. Employees are always pleasant and attentive to our needs and have made special requests(for kids because no kids menu) when needed. If you like bobas try the Thai one! YUM!"}
{"text":"I had a lunch here today,  it was worth to burn the gas from Avondale. I ordered #24 (Stir fry rice noodle with meats and veges), OMG it was soooo good, but the portion was smaller than I expected. I think I can eat here every week,  I like to try rice noodle soup (Pho) next time."}
{"text":"Excellent family owned Vietnamese restaurant in downtown Glendale. Courteous, fast service and the food is fantastic! Perhaps the best part is the value--you will be hard pressed to find better food at lower prices. My wife and I go to LS about 2-3 times per month."}
{"text":"Little Saigon in Glendale?  Holy Cow this place was fantastic. My family and I came here for lunch , and we had their Pho tai and it was delicious ! And the smelled was awesome, the classic pho soup with all the veggies. The taste was so good, it brought me back when I was Seattle visiting my son . We also experience for the first time Goi Cuon spring rolls with shrimp they were simply amazing .I almost forgot we order the Banh Xep pan fried potstickers with sauce they were so yummy .Yeah for finally finding a good authentic Vietnamese place. I miss my Vietnamese food and Yeah that I don't have to drive far to get it. Approximately  mile 1/2 away from me. I can't wait go there again ..."}
{"text":"Everything I have ordered so far has been delicious, fast friendly service, stand out dishes - the pho of course, spring rolls, yellow curry with shrimp I could go on and on."}
{"text":"Nowadays, it's hard to find a good Vietnamese restaurant. Fortunately, there's Little Saigon :).  This place opened up not too long ago and was relatively unbeknownst to the public at the start, but had gained a lot of traffic, for good reason too!  My typical order is the Pho Tai Nam - rare beef and flank steak, and I usually compare Pho places by this. Their pho is very clean tasting and doesn't leaves a lingering oily film in your mouth afterwards - the one thing I absolutely despise.  Their bun (vermicelli) is very fresh and tasty and the spring rolls are still very crisp and their filling has a nice balance of flavour.  There's only good things I can say about Little Saigon, but only time will tell if this standard will continue: take Pho Quinn for instance (feel free to check out my review there too)."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. I've tried almost everything on their menu and I've never been disappointed. I love coming here. I recommend the spring rolls, they are probably the best in town!! (In my opinion anyways) I love their vermicelli and pho too! Their staff are very friendly and always helpful."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, clean and authentic. Spring rolls and other appetizers are tasty. Pho is awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place! The Vietnamese pork spring rolls and vermicelli salad...omg...best Vietnamese in Glendale"}
{"text":"Vietnamese food in Glendale?  Holy Crap this place was fantastic.  Its set in this little ol house on Glendale and 57th ave in what appears to be a local hangout  Whats cool is that this place must have a huge following because the waiter new half the people in the restaurant.   The place is small on the inside it has two rooms.  We were in the first one as you walked in which had seating for about 20+ people it was pleasantly decorated and the beer and wine was clearly visible from our table.  They serve house wine and beer.  And yes you can get Vietnamese beer here.    We started our meal with the appetizer crepes.  The crepes were filled with yummy shrimp pork and rice noodles.  Our waiter showed us how to eat these as they come with lettuce leaves that you are supposed to wrap the crepe in add some veggies and dip in oil.  Messy But FUN!  and so so tasty.  The crepe was light and so were the fillings.  Don't be intimidated by the size of the appetizer which is monstrous because if you share its enough.    For my dinner I had the dumpling soup.  Which was just awesome.  The broth is fantastic.  The egg noodles perfect and the garnish was absolutely awesome.  It comes with mint leaves, bean sprouts and lemon.  My girl had the mix rice bowl with chicken,pork, and egg rolls.  Hers was so mouth watering and she had so much we took the other half home and had a midnight snack!  Now I haven't had Vietnamese food in forever and I was over joyed by the friendliness and comfort of this place.  We will be back.  I would recommend this for anyone wanted to try something that is a little different but very tasty.  You will be glad you did!  Lastly I dont know what this is a two cash sign price range.  For two dinners an appetizer and two glasses of wine we paid 26 bucks."}
{"text":"Little Saigon is in our top 5 restaurants here in Arizona. My husband and I love this place. First of all, it's in a fun bungalow style house in old Glendale which just adds to its charm. Second, the family that runs it is awesome. You'll be greeted by Tony or Hui (not sure how to spell it) or John and they're all great people. They know us by now and we're always greeted like old friends. I've tried half the items on the menu, which is extensive and haven't found anything I don't like. My husband is usually stuck on #35 or #36 which are their rice noodle dishes. So good. We've introduced our friends to Little Saigon and I have one friend who will gladly drive from East Scottsdale just for the fried banana/ice cream dessert (which is a MUST, by the way). In all, I will always recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I don't think I have been to a Viet restaurant, where I have to wait for a table on a weekday lunch hour. Despite its small location, I was seated quite quickly.   They didn't have much selections, so I decided to order their HOUSE SPECIAL phõ and a grilled chicken roll. The soup was very flavourful and not salty at all. Much more meats than noodles compare to most places, where the ratio would be the opposite. The chicken roll came with a homemade (?) peanut sauce that you dip in, as the roll itself did not contain much flavour, all you taste were mint, chicken, and plain rice noodles.   Price wise, not too too expensive, yet, I can't say it is cheap. But given its location is close to my house, I will definitely go here to satisfy my phõ crave."}
{"text":"First, let me start by saying the five star rating is relative. This is the best place I have found in the valley to get my Vietnamese food fix. I'm not talking the usual pho or spring rolls, I'm talking some real, hard to find, authentic Vietnamese dishes that pho restaurants don't make/serve. Compared to some of the best places I've been for Vietnamese food (including Vietnam), it wouldn't be 5 stars, but for the valley? Definitely.   They have a fairly wide selection of dishes and everything that I have tried has been well made and tastes great. My boyfriend and I usually order #65 (steamed catfish in a hot clay pot), #72 (flash fried calamari), and my favorite #88 (sweet and sour catfish soup). I love that we can get full, but it's still a light full, not heavy and greasy. Nothing like some fresh Vietnamese food to get you feeling right!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, first time for dinner and the other for lunch. The restaurant is quite small, can maybe seat like 35 people. It is a CASH ONLY place. This was the only Vietnamese restaurant area for awhile, until recently. It is a casual restaurant with a modern feel to it. Unlike other Vietnamese restaurants in the area which is more family or diner type style. Not the best place for big groups, since it will take up nearly half the restaurant.  Always check their hours before coming to this place, to ensure they are open.   Menu - (4/5) small, not too many options due to the size of their business but still sufficient.  Customer Service (4/5) - nice and friendly.  Price - (2/5) Price is a bit on the high side with respect to their portions. Been to better places, which offer more sizes and better portions for their noodle soups. I haven't tried their other main dishes.   Quality - (3.5/5) The meat is good but I found the soup quite blend, twice that I went. I try to order the same dish (i.e. pho with brisket) every Vietnamese restaurant I go. I prefer a bit saltier, that's a personal preference.   Presentation - (3/5) Pretty typical presentation for pho, nothing creative. I personally dislike the china they use to serve for pho, not really the biggest fan on slanted bowls.   Overall, it is okay. I prefer to go elsewhere for economical reasons and better soup base. I personally haven't gone back since. I have eaten other pho places in Hamilton, London, Toronto, Scarborough, and Richmond Hill; I wouldn't say this is the best place to go in the GTA. The pho places in Hamilton and London is better than this place. If you do live or work close by this place then it is an okay place."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat in Phoenix, we always stay over night  when We're passing through,  just so we can indulge our selves with the number 12 and the number 28 on the Little Saigon menu."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and will come back. I recommend every dish as they are all good and authentic. The family who owns it is real nice and sometime would greet you personally."}
{"text":"Not the best pho ive ever had but passable. The egg rolls are awesome and the catfish Is delish. For the price it was good not great. Might stop by another time. Try it once, it might be to your liking."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled chicken rice plate with a fried egg and shrimp. Great authentic Vietnamese food, it is a far drive for me so I don't come here often.  The Vietnamese coffee isn't as strong as most Vietnamese coffees I've tried.  Lots of different dishes to choose from!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The restaurant is in a kewl old house in downtown Glendale.   Pork is bomb, chicken pho killer, egg rolls and service are great!"}
{"text":"I've been there 3 or 4 times. This is the best pho I had so far in Markham/Richmond Hill area, even there is a little line up everytime I went but it definetly worth the wait.  The restaurant is super clean!  I never been to any other pho restaurant cleaner than them. $8 for medium & $9 for Large, very reasonable price.  Their medium size pho is like large compare to any other pho restaurant. When the noodle came, my nose tells the stroy....Rich broth of cracked bones, deep beef and aromatic star anise,I luv it!  The beef texture are soft +1 star !! Their spring roll are so crispy & yummy! + 3 star!!. The staff are nice but I take 0.5 away because they are a little bit slow (taking too much time cleaning the table lol) and another 0.5 away because the soup base is slightly too sweet.   Overall, the experience are great, the prices are cheap & food is excellent- comparing to the bad experience I had at another pho restaurant recently, this place is heaven.  I recommended my colleague to this place and now he went there at least once or twice weekly."}
{"text":"Definitely clean and very nice servers.  Adorable little restaurant.  The food, like packaged Vietnamese food.. Egg roll tastes like Costco frozen.  I asked for my pho to be extra spicy and was told to use one of the grocery store bottles of sauce.  I asked again when the food came and she brought me a couple of Thai peppers.  Chicken noodle soup with a couple gristle pieces of meat.  My husband got sweet and sour catfish.  Nice portion but tasted like trader Joe's frozen.  Great prices..."}
{"text":"Had pho spring roll was good spicy chicken wings made with Vietnamese chili sauce is fire hot but good. This is a place where you go for lunch break from work easy simple fast & tasty. You"}
{"text":"I liked the food my first time there, but they just keep getting the order wrong. My gf is vegetarian, STOP putting chicken in her VEGETARIAN curry. Can't trust the order to be right...so we can't go back."}
{"text":"Great little family run restaurant in downtown Glendale.  Right near antique stores and in the historic part.  The restaurant is in a quaint old house.  There are not to many Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to with atmosphere so that's an added plus.  The food is also great too.  If you love Vietnamese food you have to try this place.  If you haven't had it check out their website.  There you will find the menu and pictures of some of their food items.  Huge menu!  They don't have Vietnamese sandwiches here though.  They have a family member with a restaurant off I-17 and Bell to get your banh mì fix.  I have had the rice flour crepe with shrimp, pork and bean sprouts.  It is served with a plate of veggies.  It fills up the plate!  I also had the famous #37 with grilled pork, shrimp, egg roll and sunny side up egg.  Really good.  You'll see why it is so popular.  I also had the Pho with sliced beef.  It was not the best I ever had but very, very good.    The service is pretty good here.  The second time I went there they were fairly busy so I had to wait a short time to get seated.  The other two times they were pretty quick.  Servers were all friendly.     It is a good drive from my house but totally worth it plus It's in a great part of Glendale."}
{"text":"Little Saigon has really good Pho, but my favourite items on the menu are their rice dishes.  The Lemon Grass chicken and Lemon grass pork with rice are the best in Markham/Richmond Hill.  Their prices are also incredibly reasonable.  I wish they had a larger beverage selection though.  Nevertheless, I continue to come back to this place.    NOTE:  They only accept CASH."}
{"text":"AUTHENTIC!! Travel from Little Taipei, California,  I'm glad that I found this place to satisfy my Asian food cravings. Very solid and decent place."}
{"text":"Pro Tips: Stay with Pho or Bun Cha  With a limited menu and one would think at least Little Saigon knows what they are doing.   Photos are deceiving as I know quite well as I myself is guilty to make my food looks more tasty through my camera lens and by using filters. But their Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai ($10) was such a disaster. I can made something better than this. The plate of noodle swimming in some brownish sauce was nothing close to how it looks in the menu. This is not a restaurant quality dish.   Would I be coming back? I would only for Pho and their Summer Rolls and nothing else."}
{"text":"Had vegetarian pho here today. It was good - some of the vegetables were really too big to be eaten without cutting. Might have tried the jalapenos in the soup, but they were in pieces that were WAY too big for me to consider adding. YMMV.  Service was quick and efficient.   The place is cute - small house turned into a restaurant. We were in the biggest room - smaller rooms are quieter asI remember. Prices are reasonable. My large pho was $7.  It has been a while since I've been to Little Saigon - I should go more often."}
{"text":"Notice: This is a review for the Pho soup, none of the other dishes.   If you've been to other Pho places, the soup here tastes a little on the light side.  No matter though, it's still Pho, right?  I actually don't mind the lighter soup since it didn't make me feel as heavy/sleepy when walking out of the restaurant.  Aside from the on-the-light-side taste, the portions were good with plentiful amounts of beef, tripe, and tendon.  They also seem to serve chicken Pho here, too so if you want to avoid red meat you might want to try that out.    This place seems much more accommodating than other Pho places, most likely because the servers here actually know how to speak English.  For those who worry about poor service, you won't find that here.  These guys were on top of my water never being empty (a big one with Pho noodle soup, since it really seems to dehydrate you).  My dad also tried the Thai Boba Tea and said the boba was decent (I'm not a fan of Thai Tea, sorry!).    As for prices, they're a little on the steeper side of Pho at $9 for a combo soup, but as I mentioned above the portions are good so I would say it is worth it."}
{"text":"Came here on my quest to find the best Vietnamese Bun Cha in the Markham area and I think I found the place!  The vermicelli was perfectly cooked (chewy yet soft), the grilled meat was seasoned well, and the fried spring rolls had an extremely satisfying crunch to it.  My girlfriend ordered a pho and it was pretty good too.  I highly recommend the Bun Cha here."}
{"text":"I was bummed that they did not have Bahn Mi sandwiches. I had my heart set on that so I decided to split a plate of the stir fried flat noodles with chicken. My biggest mistake was not ordering my own plate. This dish was delicious, far exceeded my expectations! My hot pot soup with tofu was also really, really good. I definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting Asian food in the Glendale area. Nice mom and pop restaurant with real Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"I consider myself a Pho connoisseur.  This is the best pho in Richmond Hill, maybe even the GTA.  It's very clean, good service, and best of all good pho!  Highly recommend if you haven't tried."}
{"text":"I am more critical to this restaurant than some of other reviewers here. I do not think the Phos  we had tonight were that good. The soup was pretty plain, #12 had a lot of low quality beef with large amount of fat. To be honest, this place has been overrated and does not deserve the high marks."}
{"text":"It's hard to spot on the first drive by, but it's an absolutely lovely looking place. Small, but comfy to those who don't prefer higher-end luxuries. The food selection is great, and from what we've ordered: Each were delicious and of great quality. The prices were affordable, and that's a great plus considering the quality! Most of my attention went to their desserts. The fried banana with ice cream was wonderful~! Definitely recommend!  The only reason why I give it a 4-star instead of a 5-star, is that the quality of the food I've had (cubed steak cuts and stirfry beef), while great, isn't astounding in their flavors - I've had similar in other restaurants, and I've had better in rare other restaurants. Perhaps I should order more foods to see if they stand out in some items more than others. Perhaps next time I'll order an item they're well known for. By no means should you think a 4-star is a bad or unspectacular rating. It's an excellent restaurant for everything it advertises itself to be."}
{"text":"I'm always satisfied with the food here.  Everything I've tried here were decent.  Pho, Vermicelli, rice plates, vietnamese stir-fry."}
{"text":"Love this place, a great little find in downtown Glendale. Great food, service and prices!"}
{"text":"I loved my visit here.  I loved the food, the decor, and the lights all around the tiny little house they've turned into a restaurant.  We decided to go to the last night of Glendale Glitters and we were hungry.  My companion was looking for a Subway restaurant, but I sort of whined a little about how cute this place was from the outside, and he agreed to check it out with me.  WOW!  Was he ever glad he did!  I had something with shrimp and chicken, and spring rolls and a Thai Iced tea with boba.  My companion had the yellow curried chicken.  His curry smelled so good, I wanted to cry. Then I tasted it.  It was amazing!   The spring rolls were literally the best I've ever had, and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. Why not 5 stars?  Only because I've only been there once.  It get's 5 stars if we drive all the way back to Glendale just to eat here.  we shall see. In the meantime, if you live anywhere near, go!!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town.  Some of my favorite dishes include the pho ga (chicken soup) (#8), spicy lemongrass chicken (#51), marinated beef in grape leaves (#62), and steamed catfish in black pepper sauce (#65).  The combo spring rolls are the best I have ever had at any Vietnamese restaurant, and I have tried them at many places.  The prices are very reasonable, and the owners are very nice people.  We regularly make a fairly long drive to have dinner at Little Saigon because it has great food at a very good price.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times and Never have I ever received such as small drink. Wtf? And when I voice my concern the girl says \"it's bigger then the ones we usually give\". I've been here before and no, that is an utter lie! I left as a very unsatisfied customer."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! The employees are attentive and fast. Food was fast and delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are wondering if this restaurant is worth trying, welll stop wondering. This place has very authentic Vietnamese food. The owners are very nice and interact with the customers all day. My personal favorite dish would have to be the Lemongrass Chicken. It's location is perfect for the residents of Glendale because there aren't very many Vietnamese restaurants in the Northwest part of Phoenix."}
{"text":"I hesitated on whether or not I should write a review because I didn't want this place to be overpacked all the time (though it pretty much is). However, this place deserves all the credit for their food and service.  Food - Quality is amazing! Usually you find a few dying leaves or dark spots on bean sprouts, but I didn't spot anything wrong with it. Nothing is over or under seasoned. Every ingredient worked well with one another. The only complaint I have is that they ran out of shrimp paste on canes, which was really strange since we were literally the first people to go in...  Value - We both ordered 2 vermicelli bowls. The bowls were pretty big and filled to the rim. For $10.00, I really felt like it was definetely worth it.  Service & Cleanliness - Really great service and attitude. No issues with cleanliness."}
{"text":"Title: Awesome Vegetarian dishes, fellow Vegheads!  ooo...My BFF and me hit this place after the Glendale Blues/Jazz Festival the other day and were pleasantly surprised. If you blink, you pass this puppy. We only found it cause we went one street too far wondering where we parked our motorcycles.  We're Veg, so we ordered from the Vegetable entree menu and split everything.  #78 Vegetarian coconut curry  - Awesome flavor although I hate white rice, it all meshed together beautifully.  #80 Flash-fried tofu with carmelized onions and tangy soy sauce - It's the sweet soy sauce that made this dish.  #84 Bok choy soup with ginger and onions - amaaaaazing flavor. Highly recommended. Tasted good for leftovers too. mmmm. mmmm  Price was hella right, peeps. Only $6.99 for each of these delicious dishes. Say wha?????  Cheap date night fer sure!  There were only like 2 servers so the service was a bit slow but very friendly.   As of  4/9/11, they weren't serving alcohol per a few posted signs. I assume waiting for a liquor license to come through.  Will be eating at this gem and recommending to friends every chance I get."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, loved the grilled chicken vermicelli salad.  Had lunch there a week ago Saturday and will definitely return on my next trip to Phoenix to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice with the wife.  The first time I ordered a couple spring rolls and loved them so much that (for a while) we started making them at home a few times per week.  I also did the make your own spring roll for the dinner and... it was filling. Fair price and can easily feed 2 people. The staff came and offered to show me how to roll them (I've done it in the past so I declined).  My wife's noodle dish was great. She may have got pad thai but I forget. And the boba is great and has many flavors to choose from.  On our next trip we ordered the firepot soup to split and again... filling. Fair price. Good food. Definitely worth a trip into downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"I ordered a catfish dish. Amazing. Spicy and sweet and sour catfish. This was fantastic. My wife ordered spicy chicken with fried rice. It was wonderful. The egg rolls were great. Wrap them in lettuce with cilantro and mint. Wonderful flavor for the palet. Clean and homey little place. Loved the experience. The staff was great. Never needed to ask for a thing."}
{"text":"Phenomenal meal as always. We have a number of good Vietnamese restaurants in Philadelphia, but we don't have a Little Saigon. Make sure you don't miss this gem."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese restaurant in Phoenix. We have been coming here for years. It only gets better. I love the beef Pho and the shaved ice for desert."}
{"text":"First time trying Pho with my girlfriend and we picked the right spot... the location of this restaurant is very discreet but is truly a hidden gem... the food was phenomenal but what truly did it was the service. Min was super informative and took the time to answer any questions we had and explained all of the on table sauces. Our drinks were never empty and he checked on us frequently. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"There really isn't a lot of decent PHO places in Richmond Hill. When this spot opened up we had to try it. Koreans are big on PHO. Most of the decent ones down in North York Central are populated with Koreans enjoying themselves. It's a bit of a jaunt to go there so I'm glad to see one here. The place is small and run by a family (I guess) and they run a decent place. The portion sizes are good and the temperature of the soup is about just right. Their combination meat or the rare beef are good choices. Their cold rolls, spring rolls, and pork rolls are a hit with the family. We've been there quite a bit over the last year and have only one warning. If you have issues with MSG, PHO is not a good diet choice. Otherwise, Go PHO it!"}
{"text":"A delightful, delicious, darling place to go. The house is historic in downtown Glendale. Very pretty with twinkle lights on the outside. I love old buildings. I had the curry and it was delicious. Service was good too. Everyone tells me this is the place to go to get Pho. I will have to come back and check that out."}
{"text":"I'm happy to see this place is doing very well, I remember them back in the days at christown mall (spectrum mall)  They were busy but our waitress which is the daughter was good with communication skills to let us know the status of our orders.  I appreciate the times she still came to check up on us, the food was very good, very fresh, and price was very good.  There's not a lot of good Vietnamese restaurants in Arizona, but this one is probably the best due to their consistency and authentic flavor.  Not to be racist but I also noticed Viet people cooking the food in the kitchen instead of Hispanics, which is a plus for me!"}
{"text":"This is the first place I tried pho at! It was amazing! I guess you can say it's where I lost my phoginity . I went there with my friend who knows about all the pho places around. She taught me how it goes.   Let me tell you, the broth was really flavorful. I know that many people have talked about how good pho was, but I was completely clueless to dish until I tried it. It does live up to its name of being delicious. This place does a great job of keeping it that way.   The place inside is a bit small, but if I can recall, I remember that they have a private dining room or so. The outside of this place however, the building is so cute. I love the little plants around and the dim warm light setting that they have going on.   I would totally recommend anyone who is interested in going here or looking for a place of similar foods. The menu is quite limited but that does not stop me from giving this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Boo! Went with a big birthday group after confirming business hours. Got their well over 30 mins before their posted closing business time. Told us kitchen was already closed and turned us away! I would understand if it was a bar/sportsbar where they have last calls for kitchen food and a bar to operate later than their kitchen. If a restaurant has certain hours, I was always under the impression the kitchen is open until the closing time.  May take a while for me to want to come back here. Even tried to plead our case and it was a no go as the host sat there counting his money. Wow."}
{"text":"Have been here several times in the past two years or so - always great food and outstanding service.  Servers really know their stuff and are always eager to recommend the best dishes.  Menu is very extensive.  Everything is very fresh and flavorful.  The location is a (somewhat) renovated old cottage in old-town Glendale, just one short block north of Glendale Ave.  One larger dining room and three or four smaller rooms.  Everyone takes great pains to make sure you are happy.  If you are a fan or Vietnamese food or you are anxious to try it for the first time, I highly recommend Little Saigon."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for six years. I usually get the pho or the fried rice combination plate. My wife and I went this past weekend and we ordered the usual. As my wife was eating her pho, she noticed a worm on her spoon. It was very unappetizing and we immediately stopped eating. To give Saigon the benefit of the doubt, they do provide fresh herbs, so I understand this happens, but it was still gross to see.   I would still strongly recommend this place, just double check your spoon to ensure you are not eating tiny critters!"}
{"text":"Food was good but a little understaffed. Water took way too long to be brought to the table and only one food order out of two orders was brought out and it took an additional 10min for the second to come out."}
