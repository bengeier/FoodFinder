{"text":"Wouldn't even give this place one star. Took over two hours to deliver. When called the rude kurve (female dog) said \"your pizza will get there when it does!\" The guy brought the pizza an hour after it left the place so when his shift ended on his way home at 3:26am. Bs. Garlic bread is a sub bread from Walmart with garlic Sauce on it. Don't order this waste"}
{"text":"The customer dials a number. A disembodied voice says, \"Nunzio's, can you hold please?\". The customer endures a exquisitely protracted wait, places their order, and begins to wait again. After another magnificent length of time has passed, a pizza of perfect adequacy arrives at the front door. So where exactly do we find Nunzio's in all this?

Like many pizza restaurants, Nunzio's enjoys a sort of nebulous physicality, defined by the binary relationship of the disembodied voice on the phone and the delivery person who ultimately arrives at the customer's door. Outside of this basic construct however, Nunzio's is something of an anomaly of the pizza world.

Nunzio's offers a breakdown of the traditional consumer/business relationship that is usually reserved for ephemeral mega corporations. You call your wireless carrier or insurance provider and you are placed on hold, you are randomly disconnected, you are faced with monolithic indifference and dehumanization. You are not surprised by this. Yet you call Nunzio's for a pizza and are subjected to a similar experience. It is unsettling to encounter such faceless neglect at the hands of a such a small business.

This absurd neglect crystalizes in violent profundity when confronted with the abject horror of the physical store itself. Upon entering Nunzio's pizza, the customer is overwhelmed by a sense of aesthetic error. The lighting is a urinary, fluorescent yellow. There is a waiting area, separated from the kitchen by bulletproof glass, through which the pizza is reluctantly dispensed. The kitchen resembles a kitchen but little. There is an oven, and an assembly line of sorts, but there is also a strange over-abundance of space, as if the customer waiting area bled beneath the bulletproof glass. This space is usually occupied by mysteriously nonfunctional employees, silently sitting in folding chairs, staring into the void.

The problem is this: The aesthetic of Nunzio's is explicitly institutional. The experience is explicitly corporate. Defining characteristics of economic schemas have been liberated and shuffled about; it is a pizza shop that appears like a psychiatric ward. It is a small business with the chaos and disorder of a corporate bank. 

How do we experience the essence of one place in another?  What does this essential transmutability tell us about Place itself in the 21st century?

Nunzio's is selling Pizza, but they're offering void, a glimpse behind the veil of capital. We have established essence as a commodity-element so effectively that essence has become a commodity in and of itself. If a business can't afford its own sense of Place it becomes overwhelmed by the spirit of other Places. In the same way that the waiting area bleeds into the kitchen, the spirit of the institution has bled into Nunzio's. It is a zone of dissolving borders; it is haunted. 

Another way to look at the phenomenon of Nunzio's is to say, \"When I consume an energy drink, choosing Red Bull over say, a Monster, I realize that both drinks are basically the same thing: carbonated water, sweetener, caffeine, taurine, B vitamins, artificial flavoring, etc.\" Yet there is a higher order at work in the commodity of Red Bull itself, something more than just the beverage that I am buying. There is a spiritual or metaphysical quality to a can of Red Bull which attracts me. Commodity has been granted both a body and a spirit, in the same way that we allow for ourselves a body and a spirit. This intangible quality is conspicuously absent in a Nunzio's pizza.

So what do we do when confronted with a soulless commodity? Because of its abstracted physicality Nunzio's soullessness oft goes unnoticed. Under the delivery model, Nunzio's is soulless in the way that the wind is mindless. Over the phone, we have no physical form towards which we might ascribe even the conditions required for a spirit- loin des yeux, loin du couer. It is only during our brutal encounter with the physical store that the consumer is forced to observe the organizing and generative power of the product-soul through its precise absence.

So what then is the relationship between my Self and my Pizza? Is the Spiritual Pizza a sort of tulpa, willed into existence by the tenets of dogmatic mystical consumerism? Does my belief in the sublimated Pizza-Soul create the sublimated Pizza-Soul? Or has the Spirit of the Pizza taken on a life of its own, functioning independently of consumer interface? In the shadow of Nunzio's, one might imagine a postapocalyptic world. The people are dead. Their spirits have disintegrated, and the world is filled with a vast silence. Yet the smoke stained, blood-red sky is filled with the swooping forms of pizza ghosts... 

In 2016, Nunzio's persists as one of the last known bastions of soulless commodity; to order a pizza from Nunzio's is to order a pure object... Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'd like to advise the general public to NOT patronize Nunzio's Pizza. A good friend of mine was verbally harassed by a Nunzio's employee for inquiring when they can expect their pizza. After waiting for 2 hours for the pizza, at at 2:30 in the morning, my friend fell asleep. She was then further assaulted by the employee and played a frantic, threatening voicemail for me from the employee. DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DISGUSTING EMPLOYEES. I'm spreading the word nunzios- it doesn't stop here."}
{"text":"There is something intriguing about any pizza place in Cleveland that DOESN'T deliver. It makes me believe that the pizza must be THAT GOOD; sooo good that they couldn't possibly deliver a hot pizza with all the orders they would get.
Nunzios was nothing like the exclusive  \"takeout only\" winners like Pizzaz, Guidos, and Corleones. I think the only reason they dont deliver is because they dont make boxes to hold in that much grease. 
The pizza was very commercial, the cheese didn't stretch into gooey strings like real cheese; it slides off as one chunk at the first bite.

Pizza is something that I get when I'm too lazy to leave the house. If you are going for takeout; there are a ton of really great restaurants in the area that are far better.
I compare Nunzios to that Gyro stand outside the bars at 230- it's open, it's nearby,  and you will regret eating it the next day."}
{"text":"Horrible! And I don't mean the food.  I cannot comment on the food because I never received it.  2hrs after ordering, 2 phone calls from the driver who seemed incoherent at best, and 15 minutes of standing outside and we have no dinner.  Oh, and there was the \"manager\" hanging up on me.  Yeah, that was fun.  No, I did not yell or curse or lose my temper. But I still got hung up on. Really hoping they do as they said and cancel the credit card transaction because I have no desire to deal with this business again!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Horrible pizza.  They always screw up my order and last time I ordered I told them I would never be ordering from them again.  They did nothing to compensate for their mistake.  My opinion DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE."}
{"text":"The only reason why Nunzio's should ever be ordered from is if its 2am and EVERYTHING else is closed. Their staff is RUDE, and the pizza isn't even all that good. Greasy and run of the mill, only useful as a last resort."}
{"text":"Short and sweet:

Poor pizza. Poor management. Poor customer service. Will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Like rolling the dice for a delivery, there's a driver who likes to show up with a  $14 dollar pizza with no bank on him (so he says), so he can't give you change for your  $20 ( I'm stuck with giving him a  $6 tip against my will? ). { I'm 60 seconds away on Woodward, come on }"}
{"text":"Grossest pizza ever. They're only still in business because they're open late. The sauce is sour and our pizza was burnt."}
{"text":"I have been eating this pizza for years and its always great the calzones are good too the price is fair and they are open late great for when you are drunk and need something cheesy the subs are ok but i havent really given them a chance wings are great so yea i will always pick this place when ppl ask if i know s good pizza place"}
{"text":"Only go here if it is your last resort. My order took more than 1hr and 30 minutes to arrive and after delivery, was 3 minutes away from being cold. The pizza was plain and made with minimal amounts of ingredients. I almost thought I ordered plain cheese pizza. Will not be ordering from here again. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is that it's open late! Do not get the stuffed peppers appetizer...tasted horrible, very small and too expensive!"}
{"text":"What's with the bad ratings for Nunzio's?! I thought it was a Cleveland/Lakewood staple. at least it is for me. I appreciate ya Nunzio! great pizza, affordable price, plus they deliver late! these guys gotta get SO much business from the drunk kids at the Lakewood bars. would recommend for sure, drunk or sober!"}
{"text":"TL;DR The service was terrible and the pizza was worse.
Ordered  pizza at 1 a.m. and was told that it would be 30-45 minutes. When I called back over an hour later I was told the driver was on his way, half an hour later at 2:30 the pizza finally showed up. It was cold, tasted terrible, and they didn't even get our order right. Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"The best thing I can say about this place is it's open a lot. This is a late night decision that I promise you will regret. Seriously horrible pizza. It doesn't even taste good when you're drunk..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with their service today I ordered the pizza hoping that I wouldn't have to go outside due to weather and having my kids, however after waiting two hours for my delivery I decided to go to the nearest store to grab something small so my kids will have to wait any longer. I called back twice while awaiting my delivery in the guy insured me that my pizza was very close by and that it would be fresh hot and ready when it arrived.. I live close and when the pizza did arrive it was nowhere near hot nor luke warm I decided to microwave the pizza so that way I wouldn't have to have my kids wait any longer . Very disappointed and if I had an option to choose no stars trust me that's what I would give them. They did not even have the audacity to offer me a free pizza shaking my head."}
{"text":"The pizza here has always been delicious and they're the only late night pizza shop in Lakewood, so that's a huge plus.

However, their prices are too high and the delivery fee is outrageous. Online it says you'll be charged $5 for delivery, but compensated depending on how far away you live from the shop. Before knowing their location, I was fine with paying the 5 bucks, thinking they're a few miles away from my apartment and I was desperate for my cheesy carbs. Nope...the shop is literally within walking distance. I mean, a 2 minute walk. Never has a delivery driver mentioned the compensation of the delivery fee. Now that I know how close I live to them, I'll be sure to bring it up. Or I'll just walk there next time.

Note: the pizza has more cheese than the average pizza shop, so be careful when ordering  (and paying for) extra cheese. You're basically getting triple the cheese, which is completely okay in my book!"}
{"text":"This nunzio's location used to be my go-to for pizza. their hours are awesome, they are a block away from me, and best of all they had the most bomb pizza in the area - second only to Angelo's in lakewood, in my opinion. Service was only good if you were a female in my experience, which worked for me. unfortunately, within the past year, they've changed their recipe and lowered the quality. I tried it at least 5 times after this change to confirm something was off, and sad to say but a pizza place I would have given 5 stars at one point is now isn't even a last resort. I'd take little Cesar's or any other crappy chain pizza over the \"new\" Nunzios any day."}
{"text":"Vegetarian pizza is really good. I've ordered from here several times and the delivery is pretty quick only had one issue and it was because i was charged twice for an order and it took two weeks to get my money refunded. Other than that pretty decent pizza."}
{"text":"First off this place has  been around since I was a child my grandmother was from Italy! It was a honor for her to like this place . but man times have changed every time I give this place a chance sober it disappoints me I just ordered a large thick crust pizza and when I picked it up it was paper thin dry no sauce could not have been more then 4 oz of cheese and its like the owner is a perv the place is in closed with bullet proof glass and at least 6 young girls who looked like they just got out of bed wearing pajama pants I actually feel bad for them I am sure they are not making decent money and probably hit on over and over again by the owner or their family members . this place looks like a slave shop and to call their product pizza is a insult . if you are drunk and its after 230am you might like it but this place has went completely down hill and management is not doing their job it should be shut down I'm not blaming the employees what do ever because I'm sure nobody trained them properly but the managers owners etc need to fix this place and actually show they care instead of selling welfare pies ): it's sad living in Cleveland and you can not get a decent pizza pie anymore ."}
{"text":"Among the many independent pizza restaurants in the Old Brooklyn corner of Cleveland, Nunzio's is very much a place that caters to the drunk crowd. Having ordered and picked up pizza several times now, they don't seem to start cooking the pizza until you arrive to pick it up. If you call and they say it will be ready in 20 minutes, it will REALLY be ready 20 minutes after you walk in the door. Seems like they are used to dealing with a large quantity of no shows. 

As for the pizza itself, the quality is comparable to Little Caesars or any other mass produced chain. The pizza is delightfully greasy; the bottom of the box becomes transparent if you save pizza for the next day's breakfast or lunch. 

Basically Nunzio's exists to fill one need: those too drunk to drive to Taco Bell for after bar munchies."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. While I enjoy a superior pie, I'm not very picky. It's really hard for me to say a pizza seriously sucks. No matter how desperate I am for food, I'll starve before ordering from here again. 

In addition, the delivery driver wanted to make a stamp of my debit card with one of those old school machines. He also actually made a joke about running down to Florida to max it out. Creeper, I think not."}
{"text":"Okay... Sooo... As far as Yelp was concerned... You can sit down here to eat... Ummm... You absolutely can't. The parking is on the street and next to impossible to find. The food... We got a medium pepperoni pizza... The sauce was actually good...the crust was burnt. I also ordered a meatball sub.. Great bread... Decent meatballs... Not enough sauce. Not my favorite to-go pizza place, but... I would actually go back (if I were in the area)... Not bad.. Certainly not 5-star."}
{"text":"Horrible,  the worst pizza that I ever ate!!! And there menu is vary vage. I mean come on these people are so lazy, they DO NOT even make french fries!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the service was terrible. It took 45 mins to deliver then they forgot our garlic bread and it took 50 mins to come back and deliver that. When we called to ask about it they had an attitude and were not apologetic at all. Kind of a shame."}
{"text":"Maybe my good experiences have been flukes?? Or maybe it's because I didn't order the pizza? I don't know, but anyway. I have ordered Nunzios several times. My go to items are usually the \"hot pocket\"- a delicious calzone type creation stuffed with cheese, Italian meats, and hot peppers. And I have also ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce several times. Both items are always really tasty, and I even crave the hot pocket.

Service can be slow at times, and some of the drivers are a little....odd. However, the delicious hot pocket has made me a fan for life."}
{"text":"I was really dissapointed because one of my good friends raves about Nunzio's and I was not at all impressed. I ordered a calzone and it was a mistake. it was pretty much the most bland bread with cheese I have ever had. I was very unhappy. There was absolutely no flavor to the dough. My husband got a pizza and had no complaints but also said it was nothing special, \"just pizza\"."}
{"text":"The food is great. their only downfall is that the girls that answer the phones are so rude. Like, you can definitely tell they didn't go to high school. It's ridiculous. They treat you like you don't deserve to eat pizza. The food is great but the service completely sucks"}
{"text":"They don't always get it right, but let's be real: you want pizza at 2:30am and they consistently provide that service. Don't get excited, just get drunk."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, open late and has a very wide delivery area. The pasta and cheesy garlic bread is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Love this place, I can honestly say I've never had a bad pizza from here. I do wish the menu was larger though. I've had the pizza, a sandwich and pasta dinners from here, all verygood."}
{"text":"I love nunzios!! All their locations are awesome. Pizza, hot pocket (like Stromboli) they also have great meatballs for a sandwich or pasta. They recently added dessert, the tiramisu is better than the cheese cake. I do wish they made zeppoli.

The only thing I don't like is the garlic bread. It's a hoagie bun with cheese on it lol"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite pizza in Ohio City, but it has gone down hill. The last 2 pizzas were just bad.. Sort of gross. They had lots of powder all over the crust and very greasy. The flavor of the pizza was ruined by the shit ton of powder and grease from cheap bad cheese.. W t f.. What happened?"}
{"text":"This pizza is incredibly okay. If I'm totally honest, I usually eat it pretty late at night, after several drinks.. but I can still tell that it's greasy and best consumed in that state. It's open late and has fairly quick turnaround but I never crave it sober. I'm still really glad it exists, though! It's better than a lot of chains."}
{"text":"I had some delicious pizza from this location. With all of the amazing pizza options in the area (Lakewood Oh) this shop is up there. Local is better!"}
{"text":"Don't even order!! My food took an hour and a half and came cold. My wings were supposed to be \"sauce on the side\" they're the smallest wings I've ever seen and covered in sauce. When I called to check the status of my order, I was quoted that it would arrive in \"a few seconds\", twenty minutes later \"a few seconds\"... again. So I call back ten min later and talk and Angela\" who wouldn't give a last name who yelled at me and said I was wrong and that her employees never said that. They're  unprofessional, disgusting food, rude employees, never again. Why is this place open?? Who hires these morons??"}
{"text":"If you like pizza that tastes like BRUT cologne then this is the place for you. THIS PLACE IS NASSSTY. NO THANKS."}
{"text":"Despite what the ratings say here, I really like Nunzio's! So much so that I get it almost every Sunday. Not only is it cheap, but it's usually made pretty quickly and the people that work there are very friendly. The small pizza is the perfect size for me, but I will say that I've ordered a large a few times before and it didn't taste as good. Maybe size matters here? I say try it, especially if you're planning to order a small."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy Nunzio's despite the low star rating that's on this site, and the low star rating that I'm giving them now. 

They ain't no Lil Ceasers that's for sure, but when I get those late night muncies, it's NUNZIOS TO THE RESCUE everytime! 

Big tip for everyone reading this and considering ordering Nunzios right now: Don't get pizza, or wings.  The sandwiches are decent, and the spaghetti is actually the best thing they have. 

Spaghetti or bust."}
{"text":"I ordered this slop on Lazy Sunday night around 9:30 pm. I ordered a medium pizza and stuffed peppers. The food did not arrive until 11pm and when it did i opened the stuffed pepper which cost $7 there were only 3 peppers in the container no bigger than 2 inches long. They were slathered in tasteless marinara which was all over the box and bag. The flavor was awful and I just threw them out but don't worry they put a dinner roll in the container. Now on to the pizza which was cold at arrival. One bite and the cheese tried to all come off the whole piece since it was no longer hot.  The grease was out of control. Do not wast you money or stomach on this slop!!!"}
{"text":"Without question, this place serves up great tasting pizzas at reasonable prices and remains open well past the closing times of most pizza shops.  Hands down, one of the best on Clevelands West Side.  I have eaten here only 5 times or so, but every time was just as special as the one before."}
{"text":"If your drinking and you want something late this is your only option. Is it great? No but it does the job late night. Cheap and to the point. Nice delivery people."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the statements of late delivery.  I order from here almost every Friday.  I have always received by pizza on Time.  The Pizza is 80% of time very good.  However, I have received a few here and there that have been a little under cooked or the dough was too thin in the center and it was like eating a piece of paper.  With that being said, it depends on who's working or Who's cooking.  As for the wings, they are not the biggest wings so if you want big expensive wings.  go else where, Otherwise they taste good."}
{"text":"Yes they deliver and the timing is reasonable. Quality is OK. As for leftovers... Don't even go there. OK fresh, and it doesn't get better than that. Their hours are phenomenal though. If you have a late  night craving for pizza they're open! Just don't expect it to taste the same the next day when you reheat it - oven or microwave. Decent if fresh. Fresh is best. Period."}
{"text":"We got into town late on a Sunday night and asked our hotel concierge if anything was open for food. 
We got Nunzio's brochure. 

I placed 2 calls at 12:02 both of which went directly to voice mail that stated their hours of operation were until 1:30am. I called the Pearl rd location and they told me that I need to \"keep calling, their just really busy\" so I called back 4 more times. On the sixth call the answered and put me directly on hold. After being on hold for 6 minutes I had my boyfriend call from his phone. His phone call rang on the 2nd try and they put him on hold. 

After 11 minutes of holding I finally got someone on the phone (less then pleased to be answering my call) when I told her my order she tried to deter me from completing because the wait would be about an hour and a half. Shocked but starving I said okay thinking \"an hour and a half couldn't really be possible they are 3.4 miles from me\". 

After an hour and 45 minutes I called back and was told \"we are sorry, one of our drivers broke down and we are super busy he will be there in about 10-15 minutes\". After another 45 minutes (aka 2:45 am) I called back and was told \"he'll be there in 3-5 minutes hun\". It is now 2:55 am I am pissed and hungry. 

Do not support this business. They clearly have no business conducting business. 

I am sorely disappointed this was my first impression of Cleveland.

*****UPDATE*****
We received our food at 3:07 delivered by the older owner himself. No apology. Didn't offer any sort of compensation. Only because I work in the food service industry did I still tip him. And after he left we discovered that they had forgotten one of our items and everything else was COLD, not luke warm, not room temp, COLD. 

My boyfriend, pissed called back now 3:15. The first and second time they didn't answer on the third time they picked up, told us they were closed, we told them they forgot an item of our order and after some profanity on their end they replied that they would call the driver (owner) to check to see if the items were in his car then they would call back deliver them. 

We never received a call. 

We fell asleep at 3:40 after waiting to see if they would come back. 

This is an extremely poorly run business. Again, do not support them."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very dirty so I definitely would never eat in there. I've gotten carry out and delivery a few times though. The pizza is very greasy and tastes like the cardboard box it's served in. Also, the people working there are pretty dirty as well as sketchy looking. I haven't been here in awhile because the pizza is garbage."}
{"text":"awful!!! I ordered two gyros, an Italian sub, and naked wings. it took over an hour for it to be delivered (I was told 30 min). when my food came I had hot wings, so I called to say I might have received someone else's wings, the woman was so rude to me! she told me I would have to wait 20 min for them to make my wings, wait for a driver to come back, and then they'd deliver them. when I said I don't want to wait that long since I had waited an hour already the woman started yelling at me! the gyros that did come were more lettuce and tomato than meat, and they had ranch dressing on them and no onion? the Italian sub was only salami and ham with a bunch of lettuce and tomato. needless to say I will NEVER be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Loved the Tortellini and Garlic cheese bread.. Good sized servings and great flavors.  Loved that they delivered too!"}
{"text":"I ordered a calzone and a dinner salad to my hotel after a late flight into Cleveland one night. My order was delivered over 75 minutes later with no plastic ware or napkins. The calzone was luke-warm and lost a significant amount of juice, making it very messy. Perhaps, that would have been avoided with proper utensils. 

I shouldn't have expected much at this hour, but that still doesn't mean anyone should ever purchase food from this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my go to place almost every Friday night. It's become a serious habit and they know me by name.
It's more of a hidden treasure with good greasy food then a high class pizza joint that you pay way too much for.
When you order extra cheese, they do not hold back and I love it! Cooked to gooey perfection, it's always fresh and pairs very well with Friday night beer. I always get the hot wigs (extra crispy) and the never disappoint me!
The price is super fair for the quantity and quality of the food you get, and like I said the staff is so nice!"}
{"text":"This is a solid 3-star pizza joint. If I was having a really bad pizza craving and they were they only place open I might even toss in another star. It won't blow your hair back but it's certainly orders of magnitude better than anything you'll get in the Giant Eagle freezer section. This was our first experience with Nunzio's and it was delivery. Here are the highlights:

Customer Service: Average on the phone. I'm not saying I need to have a excitement, it's just that the guy on the other end was all business, flat affect and straight to the point. I could hear in his voice that he wasn't happy to be there. On the positive side, he did get our order right.

Delivery: The guy on the phone told us \"within the hour\". Nice CYA line. The reality? About 20 minutes between hang-up and door knock. Pretty damn fast if you ask me. They are 0.5 miles from our house, though.

Pizza (medium 8-slice, pepperoni, mushroom, banana pepper): This is your typical pizza joint pizza. The crust was fair to middling, not too thin not too thick. Crispy and tasty as far as crusts go. The sauce, and probably all of the other ingredients on our pie, was canned and tasted slightly metallic. Not bad, just noticeable. It was also on the sweet side (read HFCS) but all-in-all not horrible. I thought they were a bit stingy on both the sauce and cheese amounts. If I can see sauce through the cheese, it's not enough.

Garlic Bread with Cheese: It was a white, sesame seed-topped hogie roll slathered in garlic butter, herbs and provolone cheese. What's not to like. Unfortunately, it was wrapped in foil which meant it was soggy when it arrive. Still sucked it all down.

House Salad: No surprises with this one. Your typical pizzeria salad - iceberg lettuce, shredded provolone, diced tomatoes. The tomato was anemically pale and horribly out of season, not their fault, and the rest did as much as it could. The house Italian dressing is very sweet.  

Our total order (excluding tip) was $20 even. Not bad for two people I suppose. I won't lose any sleep dreaming about a follow-up visit with Nunzios but I certainly won't be having any nightmares either. They're a bit of a neutral experience as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Called to get a delivery and the girl who answered the phone tonight just was the rudest employee I have ever talked too! Not only did I ask to speak to the manager 5 times she actually denied me to be able to speak to her manager! She sounded so ghetto it was ridiculous they had her even answering the phones. I ask a question and not only did she give me an answer very rudely she yelled out the question for her coworkers to answer with them yelling back through the phone at me the answer! My friends and I have decided to pass over Nunzios as our weekly girls night in spot. NO THANKS we would much rather give our business to an appreciative company who appreciates there customers. Nunzios on Lorain is trash as well as there disgustingly ghetto employee."}
{"text":"This pizza place has great pizza but if you're in a hurry, don't bother.  They are extremely busy so the wait can be long for a delivery. Especially on the weekends. I know this but don't mind the wait because they are good."}
{"text":"My experiences have been all over the place with Nunzio's, so it's really hard to settle on a review. 

Here is the back story: Several years ago we dropped in for a few slices during St. Patrick's day activities. At the time (and under the influence of green beer) we thought the pizza was amazing. So good we couldn't stop talking about it. The next day we picked up a whole pie and it was hot garbage pizza. I don't remember the details but we thought it was awful & we distrusted our drunken memory of the delicious pizza we thought we had enjoyed the day before. We vowed to never eat Nunzio's again. It became a punchline in our household--beware of Nunzio's, the pizza you should only eat intoxicated! 

Flash forward to this week, we walked home from a local establishment (not intoxicated but hungry) and decided to give the place another chance. Nunzio's is a Cleveland-area staple and it's really close to where we live too. So we picked up a few single slices which come with a can of pop per slice. Not a bad deal! They produced the slices in a timely manner and we're pretty friendly. (Note: The weird thing is they didn't tell us until after our order was complete that the \"credit card machine was down\" and they needed us to pay in cash. Fortunately we were able to do that.) When we got home we were pleasantly surprised! Nunzio's was good pizza again! How could this be?

Because we are new home owners we have received several \"welcome to the neighborhood\" complimentary pizzas and other coupons to local establishments. One of those happened to be Nunzio's & as stated previously, we were too cautious to enjoy even a free pizza. But after trying a few slices the week before we decided to give it a go. 

We ordered a large pepperoni and cheese pizza. We were given an estimate that the pizza would arrive in 45 minutes and it came in less time than that. The crust was good, crispy where it should be and not too \"bready\" like commercially prepared pizzas. Where I think Nunzio's shines is the pepperoni and cheese. The toppings were thick and likely to come off in one bite, leaving the slice naked but still yummy. I really enjoyed the ratio. 

The one thing you should be aware of.... this pizza is grease city! The slices were drenched in orange pepperoni grease and it was also on the box. They lined the box with was paper so the grease didn't seep through. Fortunately, the grease didn't upset my tummy or anything. 

I guess the last thing to know is that they deliver up to 3am. And that's really Nunzio's most unique quality. 

All in all, I'm glad I gave Nunzio's a second chance. I would like to give them more stars based on my most recent experiences... but my past memories are still very strong and I'm not ready to let my guard down."}
{"text":"Prob the worst pizza ever! Thin and nasty sauce, Tony's frozen pizza is way better..Don't recommend to anyone with any kind of taste buds...."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Lakewood! Yes, it's greasy but I don't believe that's a deterrent for good pizza. My favorite part is the crust and the salty sauce! Also I love their speedy deliveries and late night hours!"}
{"text":"I love you Nunzio's.  Great INEXPENSIVE pizza and late nights......3am late nights. I have ordered from multiple Nunzios locations and each time it's been great. Medium and three toppings for pick up. Side of meat balls and you can't go wrong. Their garlic bread is really solid too. As with any pizza place I always recommend pickup rather than delivery. I will continue to order and frequent this Nunzios Lakewood location. Rock on Daddy O'"}
{"text":"Great pizza if your ever near here, I love the way they make it, ummmmmm... You got to give them a try to see for yourself, you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to grab a late night pizza. This past Friday I was craving their cheesy, salty, hot pizza. I ordered a half sheet pizza. I was very disappointed when I got a pizza that had clearly been sitting and reheated and sent to me. When I called the person who answered was rude and dismissive and didn't even apologize for my unsatisfactory pizza. She just said she would note it. Previously they had been very good about correcting their mistakes but in the last 6  months the current staff has been less than courteous to put it mildy. I probably will not call them again because they insulted my intelligence trying to convince me that the pizza was freshly made. That pissed me off."}
{"text":"Looking for pizza late Sunday, and this was the only choice. Wow what a great choice. Pizza was delivered hot and on time. The toppings were more than expected and man did it taste great! Thanks Nunzio's!"}
{"text":"Delivered after midnight. Meatballs were seasond well,  the bbq wings were tangy, and the delivery was prompt the prices were excellent. Only thing holding back the 5th star would be more fresh ingredients. Thanks for a late night dinner."}
{"text":"I have never written a review on yelp but after the food I ordered last night I had to review this place.  First I have to say I have had Nunzio's a few times in the past and I am NOT a fan of their greasy pizza.  So after working a double last night and knowing that everything else was closed I figure I would order something other than their pizza.  After looking at their menu I decided on a gyro.  Worst decision EVER.

First of all I was told delivery time was 30-45 minutes, which wasn't bad.  Well 90 minutes later still no food. When my husband called back the female who answered the phone was very rude but said the food was on it's way.  30 minutes later the food shows up and OMG I couldn't believe that they charged $6.00 for that little gyro, but hey whatever.  So I open the foil and I can't believe what I am looking at.  The pita was obviously microwaved because the edges had that hard, chewy quality but it was soggy in the middle and the meat was some sort of pre-packaged frozen meat product that was completely flavorless unless you count salt as a flavor. And the absolute worst part about this sandwich of shame was instead of a creamy delicious cucumber sauce it had RANCH on it.  WTF.  One bite and I started gagging. I couldn't even finish the thing. It was without a doubt the most disgusting gyro I have ever attempted to eat

As I said I have ordered from and been disappointed with Nunzio's before but this was the final straw.  I will never order from their again and I will be damned and strung up on my lawn before they get another dime of my hard earned money.  Never been more disappointed in my life."}
{"text":"SO good! This is my favorite pizza place. The sauce is never too much, and it's always super greasy and yummy, the way a pizza should be. It's an added bonus that they are open so late, too."}
{"text":"Nunzio's is actually my favorite pizza in Cleveland. But holy shit, don't get it delivered. The Lakewood location is NOTORIOUS for being late and your pizza will be cold and delivered by some teenage punk with his pants hanging off his ass. Granted, it's tough to get a pizza delivered in 30 minutes or less, but my last delivery order did not arrive until 1 hour and 45 minutes after I called! And I live 2.5 miles from them! The pizza is good. Just go pick it up."}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZA & WINGS!!!!! I've been getting their pizza for years. They are open late. Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZA & WINGS!!!!! I've been getting their pizza for years. They are open late. Awesome!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZA & WINGS!!!!! I've been getting their pizza for years. They are open late. Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Best Spaghetti and meatballs delivered piping hot to my hotel room downtown .....Thank you very much!  Great food and fast delivery for midnight"}
{"text":"Nunzio's on Lorain Ave is simply the best! Great crust, perfect sauce (I don't like sweet like Angelo's and some others), and good quality toppings--even the onions are good. I usually get it with sausage, mushrooms and onions and it's always perfect. I cannot vouch for delivery as I always pick it up. The only reason I don't give it four stars is that the place is not a pleasant space to go...kind of a hole in the wall, at least that is the appearance. But the important thing is the pizza, and it is hard to find one better on the west side of Cleveland. The service is usually very pleasant and friendly. I highly recommend Nunzio's!"}
{"text":"I have had their pizza with sausage, mushroom and onion many times, and thought that was great. But finally ordered one of their Italian specialty pizzas. The Four Seasons pizza, with ham, artichokes, olives and crushed tomatoes is the best pizza I've had in years. I split a medium with a friend. A little while after I dropped her off, she called and said she wished she had gotten a whole pizza for herself. She had never had artichokes before in her life and didn't know if she'd like them. We both love the four seasons pizza and will get it many more times. A very special tasting pizza, much better than Angelo's with their too sweet sauce. Unfortunate some crazies gave them a low rating for no good reason at all. Love ya, Nunzio's!!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit my mother in Cleveland, I make it a point to get us a Nunzio's pizza.  The crust is exceptional, slightly crispy with a al dente chew.  The sauce is equally superb, tangy and luscious, but mellowed so it is not overpowering.   The toppings are always generous; plenty of cheese and large-sized chunks of meat and/or vegetables.  I must add that the ample toppings are nicely and equally distributed on the pie; so often lazy pizza makers lump everything together in the center of the pizza.  I can't speak to delivery times, as I'm able to pick up my order, given that my mom lives across the street.  I wish Nunzio's would open a parlor in Sacramento, as I'd be a regular customer, eventually becoming fat (but happy)."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  The pizza took ninety minutes to arrive and when it did it was cold.  Also, the four dollar delivery charge is a little steep.  Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the previous review. I don't expect anyone ordering pizza after 2am really cares or realizes what their eating tastes like- and its cool there is the option to have it delivered to you until 4am (?) and that is- if you're cool with the dough tasting like cool water cologne / axe body spray, and sprinkled with a pube here and there.. just sayin'"}
{"text":"Rude and very disrespectful. Did not have pizza and their dipping sauce tasted like horse radish"}
{"text":"Not only is the pizza simply mediocre at best... the customer service, or lack there of, is absolutely disgusting.  I was verbally harassed by the woman who took my order and then received a threatening voicemail.  After I never received my pizza, i was charged for my food and have not heard from anyone in my attempt to receive my credit or resolve this situation.  I am absolutely appalled by this experience and fully intend to receive a refund somehow.  Do not order from this wretched establishment unless you want to take the chance of being treated like garbage by a piece of garbage for a piece of garbage."}
{"text":"Their pizza is great and cheap, and I love that they deliver until 3:30am most nights, but their customer service is lacking. The staff on the phone is abrasive and quick to cut you off."}
{"text":"Nunzios used to be my go-to pizza joint, not just because they are a hop and a skip from my house or because they're open super late, but because they had some of the best pizzas in town. Keyword, had. 

I don't know exactly what happened, but I can only assume they started using cheaper ingredients. That's certainly what it tastes like anyways.

I'll still continue to order from them though, because every once in awhile you need a pizza delivered to your house at 2am when you have the drunk munchies. That's really all they're good for."}
{"text":"I can get a pizza delivered to me at 2:30am, and the delivery people are always nice. The pizza is consistently tasty and they haven't messed up an order yet. So I say it's good."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! 
Open late! That's the best part about this place. 
Just got a deluxe pizza (minus anchovies, and added olives). You know when you get a fully loaded pizza that the dough gets soggy and then everything falls off and the pizza is greasy and flops over? This doesn't! First pizza I've had in a long time that doesn't do any of this. It's not hard or tough to eat. The sauce is the perfect amount and they don't skimp on the toppings. There is a small dining area in this location. Always clean and fluffy people friendly. You can even order online now. 
I got a Large Deluxe and a Large pepperoni. $29 got both but they're both big!! 
You won't be disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"Still great pizza, had the half sheet pepperoni, extra cheese pizza, salad & garlic bread with cheese, wife said salad was real good, however the garlic brad this time lacked flavor, couldn't tell if they used the prepared garlic butter/sauce, it was cheesy, but over all it was still a great meal..."}
{"text":"Their pizza pie is definitely delicious.  Truly not my go to because of the location but when I'm coming back home with friends in a cab from some downtown fun, we make sure to make a pit stop here to get some grub.  By the time we order it and fetch a cab, the order is usually ready by the time we get there.  They are open super late on the weekends which makes it easy to make a decision on where to go for our late night bites.

I've never eaten anything but their pizza which is quite delicious when you're hung over.  I honestly don't think this pizza tastes that good as a leftover but some people may think otherwise.  They were a bit stingy on the toppings but their pizza sauce was pretty good.

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a pizza super late at night."}
{"text":"I'm assuming the ONLY reason people order from here is because it's the only pizza place open late. I have tried this place numerous times.. Not just super late night either. I would expect that pizza would arrive at least warm. Every other pizza place in Lakewood is able to deliver hot, fresh pizza. Every pizza I have ordered arrives less than warm & the cheese on the pizza is hard - like it had been just sitting for a long time. This is especially strange considering I live less than a mile from this location. Do not order the cheese garlic bread.. It's just a sub sandwich bun microwaved with cheese on it. If they upped their game, they could quadruple their sales considering they're the only ones open late. I'd rather leave my apartment late night & drive to My Friend's to pick up some hot food."}
{"text":"We get pizza delivered from Nunzio's a few times a year. We get the \"Margherita\" which is a cheese pizza with a garlicky tomato sauce. This is not a health food item - more of a special treat. The pizza has always been consistent. And our one cat loves their pizza boxes."}
{"text":"Ordered again, this time had it delivered. Placed order at 5:30, were told 40 minutes to and hour. Our food arrived before 6. Has pizza boneless wings and mozz sticks. Every thing was right, hot and awesome. People were very pleasant on phone and the driver.  I still don't see why everyone else has such bad experiences."}
{"text":"We order from this place almost every weekend with service getting increasingly worse. Last weekend the driver didn't have change because he said \"they only have him 12 dollars\". Last night we order a medium pizza and garlic bread at 1220. The pizza arrived after 2, cold and there was no garlic bread which the driver \"waited for\". I don't know why he didn't have it if that's the case and we were charged for it. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Wish I could write about the food however we just stood inside for 10 mins without anyone to take our order at 6 at night.  You could see the guy inside with his headphones in and on his cell phone and yes we could've made a deal out of it however I should not have to get someone attention to take my money."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would. I am shivering on my porch waiting for my disgusting pizza and I have been here for over forty minutes. The woman on the phone with me was so rude. Honestly I'm not sure if it is even worth the late night hours."}
{"text":"Pizza is good when you are out and need something to eat at 3am. It got the job done. Price was good for the quantity. Visiting the city from Texas so it was good to have some local instead of a big brand I can get anywhere."}
{"text":"I am surprised there are so many complaints of late pizza.  The delivery guys drive much too fast for the narrow streets in Lakewood-too dangerous.  Slow down!!!"}
{"text":"Just got delivery from here and wtf... ordered the half sheet pizza and at some point it was evidently sideways from there to here. We got 2 toppings on one side, 2 on the other and when we opened it, about 1/4 of the pizza was \"mine\" as the other ingredients had slid over. This in itself might not be a problem - I could maybe give it an \"eh, whatever,\" but then in taking 2 bites, I knew that for how greasy the pizza was, if I ate it my digestive system would be in for a cleansing if you know what I mean. 

I called them back and said I wanted my credit card refunded. She had to call the owner. The driver promptly came back with a \"Transaction Voided\" receipt and I was told that the amount would be credited to my account within 2-3 business days. Oh, and incidentally, they even asked us to return the 2 liter of soda - so we had to pour it back into the bottle from our glasses. I should have said I was keeping it for the inconvenience, but you know, whatever. 

Needless to say I will NOT be ordering from Nunzio's again."}
{"text":"Oh Nunzios, how you saved our lives tonight. I work in a bar and tonight was our. Busiest bar night of the month.  My coworkers and I were starving and instead of swamping our kitchen with our food orders,our boss decided we should order a couple zas.  My,coworker suggested Nunzios and we went with it. I ordered a half sheet and a large both with pepperoni and sausage. The woman on the phone was so polite and understanding.  We had a could of requests. Being that we are a restaurant,  we didn't want the pizza delivered to the front door so I asked that they call and meet me around the back when they arrived. I also asked If they could deliver as close to 10 pm as possible(before our big rush) . Both requests were met and we feasted on some glorious pies. Now okay it may not be the greatest pizza in the land but DAMN it was tasty. We are all at work anywhere from 10-13 hours, bust our butts, and don't really have time to sit down to eat food. That za made us all very happy campers and gave us the energy to push through without being hungry, grumpy Gusses.  So thanks Nunzios for being prompt and tasty. We will for sure be calling you next month!"}
{"text":"Well....   They are open late.  That deserves a second star right? The pizza is super greasy but is ok when three sheats to the wind after a late weekend night. Warning: It may have tasted ok at 4am but do not try to eat it in the morning after sitting in the refrigerator. The grease just gets hard and sits on top. Not a good situation. Delivery is crazy slow. Probably no surprise here, half of Lakewood is trying to get there beer munchies."}
{"text":"Some of the best traditional pizza around. Great delivery hours and inexpensive! Top 10 in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"A lot of people will call Nunzio's up in the middle of the night because they are drunk and hungry. I have only been in that condition when I made the irrational decision of ordering this trash. On one occasion, a friend was in town visiting and wanted pizza before he crashed. I said order Nunzio's because nothing else was open. We waited about 2 and half hours for a cold, lousy pizza. It is never a good idea to order."}
{"text":"Dear Yelphouse Forum, 
 
I know this will sound made up, but believe me it is all true. Couple nights before New Year's Eve. I was at a swinging party on Lakewood's north side. Me and three girls. Two were sisters! We were all schmoozing, taking pictures, drinking some Stoli and cola. We were talking about some racy movies we had seen recently. You know, like Battlefield Earth and stuff. Now here's where it gets weird. 

It's about one in the morning. A very sexy time of night. I started to feel this strange sensation take over my body. I was getting a craving. For something hot. Oh yeah, hot and gooey. Something I could rip apart and shove my face in to. A box. Full of pizza. So I left and went down the street. Bars were emptying out. Women were stumbling around, flashing their goods, screaming in ecstasy. Or you know, vomitous sickness. I saw a neon light. Like the kind you see all over the seedy part of town. It said \"OPEN\". Yeah, that's how I like it. I called the number in the window. A sultry lady's voice cooed over the line, \"Thank you for calling Nunzio's, how can I help you?\" I had to loosen my tie. \"(gulp), I'd like two pizzas. Large.\" 

\"Large? Okay, what do you want on them?\", she purred. I asked for black olives on one. And asked for the other one bare. Mmmmmmm, bare. \"Twenty minutes. What's your name?\", she beckoned. I could barely speak from the excitement. I waited in my car. I could see there were TWO ladies in the shop. Two exotic Sicilian ladies kneading dough with their firm hands. They wiped sweat from their brows. Oh to be the kitchen towel that caught some of that sweat. Then the big moment came. I went to the door. They told me to come in. She told me the price. This wasn't the first time I'd paid for it. Whipped out my, ahem, debit card. The heat of the pizza shop made me delirious. Like a Bangkok hotel. I stepped out into the cold Cleveland air with my two hot numbers in my arms. I quickly raced home to have my way with my saucy Italian tarts. Let's just say when it was all over, I was beyond satisfied. Late at night, when no one else is available, Nunzio's is the place to go for some cheap fantasy fulfillment. If your fantasy is pizza."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Lakewood and needed an emergency food option, what this means is your too exhausted or too lazy to make a meal or go out. My upstairs neighbors recommended nunzios ... So I finally used my emergency option tonight. I ordered a medium hot and mild pizza and a dinner salad. 16 bucks. Let me preface this review with this, I'm from a \" pizza \" family. We own to this day a pizza restaurant that has been around for 20 plus years. 

The pizza was good, great crust , great flavor from the items on it, black olives, ham,hot banana peppers and crushed tomatoes as a base. Good quality size and excellent flavor. Bottom of the pie was not very crisp but not unusual for any pizza delivery. 
My only dislike of my experience was the salad , it was in a styrofoam soup cup .. A little unfortunate for 3.25. It was simple run of the mill iceberg lettuce with a few tomatoes and cheese. You get either ranch or blue cheese as dressing choices... What ever happened to Italian dressing at a \"Italian\" pizza place... 

The gal on the phone also delivered my pizza she was friendly and professional. I'm confused on why so many people had bad experiences, because if they all went like mine this joint would have great reviews all around. I was quoted 40 minute delivery time, it came in 20.

All in all it was a cheap pie that was extremely good on flavor , in a very quick time frame. Great experience."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious....well done wings were great.....garlic bread was moist and amazing. 

Calzone was well stuffed, crisp, and delicious. 

I suppose from the other reviews, A year has had a tremendous effect. 

Definitely one of the best around here.   

I should know...we order at least twice a week.  Now this will be a regular place for us."}
{"text":"I have ordered pizza from here dozens of times and not always very late night...I have to say that Nunzios is very consistent ...it's really good pizza whether I am drunk or not!  
The marguerita pizza is awesome ...also the one with the works is great as well ...my two best friends always order the garlic pizza !  
Go Nunzios !"}
{"text":"Do not order pizza from this place for delivery using your credit card. And do not order from them late at night. The pizza may not get to you and you may be charged for it even if you don't get it.

One late night, I ordered a pizza from Nunzio's using my credit card.
The woman took my order and told me that the pizza would arrive at my place in 40 minutes.

More than an hour later my pizza never arrived and the place was closed.

I called the next day and asked about getting either a refund or my pizza actually delivered to me, but I was told that the crew that worked that night was no longer working, and would not be back for several days; so nothing could be done unless I spoke with that crew. This didn't make much sense to me; especially since I had proof that I had been charged for the pizza and that there was not any return phone call to me letting me know that they were on the way or that they were outside my house.

I don't like it ... They need to do better. That is all."}
{"text":"Absolutely god awful service. 2 hrs has past and they're still not here. If you live here I would never order from this company ever. I have never waited this long for one simple pizza. Don't waste your money on this garbage place"}
{"text":"We picked some of this pizza up on the way home after a late night out. Now, I usually am very critical of my pizza... but when you are out to get Nunzios at 3 am, you most likely aren't going to be too picky. What I will tell you is that this place is inexpensive 8.25 for a medium cheese and it really hit the spot."}
