{"text":"We stopped in to Manna Sushi before we realized it had changed hands. We were regular customers when we lived in the NW at the former Yamato's in the same location. 

The restaurant was empty at 7:00 on Monday night. That should have been our first clue something was different.  There was a terrible smell (urine?) at our first table, so we moved to another table. At that point I would have left, but my husband wanted to stay, so we stuck it out. 

All of the sushi and sashimi was mediocre at best. The wild salmon sashimi was nasty - it tasted as though it had been frozen and thawed multiple times. The rice was tasteless.  The vegetable tempura pieces were too large to handle easily, and one of the veggies was green onion - which might have been tasty if it wasn't so chewy it was almost inedible. The portions were small.  I left the restaurant hoping we would not get sick later.

Our server was friendly, but awkward.  The sushi chefs were out of sight except for when they made an appearance to make our food.  They muttered to each other in low tones behind the bar - a far cry from the friendly atmosphere we were used to at Yamato's.

The lack of changes to the look of this restaurant makes me wonder if the new owners hoped to capitalize on the former Yamato's success, but it shows a distinct lack of pride and confidence in their brand.

{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to Yamato Japanese Restaurant for a number of years and thought we would would try Manna Japanese Restaurant. Well, the restaurant has definitely taken a turn for the worse. We were there on July 4th. My husband had the Chirashi Don and I had the Manna Don. Both dishes were very underwelming. We will not be back. Thank goodness there are other (much better) Japanese restaurant options in the NW -- Sushi-Bar Miki in Montgomery, Roku in Royal Oak and Sakana Grill in Crowfoot."}
{"text":"It used to be Yamato Sushi. The interior is pretty much the same, but quality of the sushi went down."}
{"text":"It's true: Manna doesn't quite have that same appeal as it used to when it was called Yamato even though the furniture, lighting, atmosphere, menu and food are all basically the same. Place used to be busy most of the time. Now it's always quieter and more regularly empty.
Anyways, I ordered the sushi&sashimi combo, a dragon maki roll, and a salmon belly sushi. With the exception of the dragon roll, which looked and tasted great, everything came out looking a little dry, including the wasabi and ginger. The salmon belly exceeded my visual expectations however and was very good. Overall, the combo was a bad choice which I sort of regret. 4/7 sushis it included were Shitake and Chuka Wakame (seaweed salad), Inari (bean curd), and tobiko (flying fish roe), which aren't my idea of good sushi. But, that's what you get when you order a combo. It's never the quality stuff you actually like. Hence, my regret in my own decision. Sorta felt like I was eating scraps left behind on the sushi bar. 

Next time I know to just stick to ordering specific rolls or good sushi/sashimis from that part of the menu, because those were what made my meal delicious. 

I've ordered ramen from Manna in the past also. You can't really go wrong with ramen anywhere. I enjoy having a local sushi place in Brentwood which, despite my critiques, is still far far better than some sushi express place in a mall, and better than Kinjo as well. (On par with food, but a far better atmosphere here at Manna). 

I can't really give higher than 3 stars even thought I want to. Comparatively, Globefish is a 3+* for sushi, and there are 4 & 5 star ramen places in town which are better. I like Manna because it serves both if you want. Reasonable prices, reasonable quality. I'll come back for sure, but mostly out of convenience."}
