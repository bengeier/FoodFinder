{"text":"Delivered wrong pizza.  When called, the guy on the phone didn't seem to care.  I can order from any of the thousand other delivery places.  Thanks, Stevie's"}
{"text":"This place is completely operated by the owner. He makes a great pizza and works hard for his customers. There are great lunch specials here."}
{"text":"Wings were really good! The salads are pretty good too, and they have \"good ranch\"! Good ranch (meaning not oily) is hard to come by.   Plus they deliver. I've read other comments about delivery being slow. I had No problem with wait time for delivery, don't wait till you're starving to order then get mad because you don't get your food instantly."}
{"text":"I just love Stevie's! I love the pizza(typically cheese only or Veggie). I love the family owned atmosphere. I love the customer service.  I started out eating Stevie's pizza at their 59th and the 101 location and when I saw they had moved into vistancia I was ecstatic! This location is always clean and well kept. The older man who is always there is very friendly and has always made us happy. Sometimes he is not in a great mood due to employees and what not...even though he may show his emotions/frustrations to his workers he has never once said a rude or mean word to me or anyone I have been with. I personally love this, it's a family owned business and that's the glory of America, you get to run your business pretty much however you want. I love that Stevie's is AUTHENTIC, no order taking robots!!  The only time I ever had \"trouble\" here was one night when my boyfriend and I picked up a pizza and he handed us the wrong one which had meat on it (we don't eat meat) but luckily we sneaked a peak at our delicious pizza in the parking lot and realized the mistake. We took it back in and had a good laugh with the owner and he cooked us a new pizza. My only advice is that when you \"mess up\" an order you should take your time and cook it how you normally would and even put a little extra love in it. Our pizza was still really good but the three main factors that draw us to Stevie's is the crunchy crust(even at the middle of the pie), the perfectly golden cooked cheese, and not to much sauce...sadly they were all lacking this day. I'll still be back and still refer people here. Thank you Stevie's for your great pizza!"}
{"text":"People were nice.  Pizza horrible.  We got deep dish pizza and the crust was so hard that we had to eat only the top part of the pizza and leave the bottom for trash.  Barros and Papa Murphy's is so much better.  I didn't think you can mess up pizza, but this place managed to do just that.  You couldn't pay us to eat there again.  Do NOT get this pizza!  Waste of money."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in all the valley! I'm from New Jersey and know what a good Pizza should taste like . Add a  friendly staff,  a cozy place for dinner and you have a perfect experience."}
{"text":"This place is very lucky to serve such a great community and great food been here twice before for dinner and for pizzas awesome great food the old man seems kind of grumpy sometimes but the food pays for it it's that New York attitude and New York flavor"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great people! Quick delivery service. I travel about 8 miles out of my way to eat at Stevie's because of their lunch special."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The pizza is over priced & nothing special. Delivery took one hour. Would not recommend, but they do deliver to Vistancia."}
{"text":"We brought a large group of girls in for dinner and we were treated so nice! The service was wonderful and the Pizza was delicious! Love the crust! We will definitely be back with our families!"}
{"text":"As new residents of Peoria my boyfriend I made it a point to find our new 'go-to' pizza joint. And boy did we find it! After trying a handful of other pizza places in the area we were thinking we weren't going to find a place we truly enjoyed, but we did and it's Stevie's. Not only does Stevie's know how to make delicious crispy crust, the flavor of the sauce and quantity on the pizza is perfect. We love their veggie pizza and broccoli roll! My parents love the hot wings and pepperoni pizza! Oh, and the Eggplant Parmesan is so filling and satisfying. There is so much to choose from on the menu, we are excited to try everything Stevie's has to offer. We also appreciate seeing the owner each time we go in, as we value his no nonsense attitude because it makes for good service and food. He also expresses his joy for his restaurant and recipes, which is attractive to customers like us.  Thanks Stevie's, we looking forward to trying even more of your delicious food!"}
{"text":"This review encompasses a number of visits to Stevie's. Overall, their pizza is tasty, good amount of sauce and cheese (this is for a cheese pizza only, no toppings). Big slices as well. Where they lose points is on a couple of issues, I have ordered their hot sandwiches on several occasions and the chicken parm frightens me because it didn't taste or look like a slice of actual chicken breast. I opened the sandwich and the chicken was cut? into cubes. Ok, that's the way they cook it BUT when I looked a little closer at my cube it actually had tiny holes in it, kind of like something you'd find at a meat processing plant. Needless to say, I have never ordered their hot sandwiches again. Now on to the pizza, like I said, the overall flavor is quite good BUT whenever I order a pizza with toppings (we like pepperoni & onions - sometimes olives), the toppings are just sprinkled on an already made pizza, so the texture of each topping is wonky or off. You would think that ordering a pizza with toppings they would make a fresh pizza but alas that has not been the case on many occasions. Oh well, back to making my own. Of course, YMMV!"}
{"text":"Will NEVER  order here again. Promised a 45 minute delivery. After giving clear directions to our house in Vistancia, they tried to deliver to wrong address. Calling to find out what happened the owners  daughter blamed it on us and hung up on us. This took TWO HOURS  to get a pizza . The owner finally delivered a pizza that they had to return to store to heat up. Instead of making the situation right, the father/owner defended his daughter's hanging up on us saying they must have been busy, he told us to spend our money somewhere else. THAT WILL BE NO PROBLEM!  This is the second time we had issues, but thought the first time was just one if those things. This is the standard they have set for themselves. STAY AWAY. Being busy is no excuse. Crappy pizza , crappy attitude ,crappy service.  There are 2 other pizza stores that will deliver here! ONE STAR because I could not give a ZERO"}
{"text":"This is my goto place, the owner is a total New Yorker (straight to the point) and his family is super cool.  Food great, I love the sausage pizza."}
{"text":"This is a short review of a modest pizza parlor that I have visited about five times to eat pizza.  I have not tried their pasta dishes.  The first time I would have given it three stars for good pizza but all red wine is stored in a refrigerator at about 40 degrees, so forget having a glass of Chianti.  The next few times the pizza wasn't quite as good.  But the last time, my pizza had handfuls of ingredients piled on top in clumps, and the crust was soggy, and at places there were three or four slices of pepperoni on top of each other and sitting in an orange puddle of grease.  This pizza was horrible, and I have not been back.  Consistency is critical in making good pizza (as Bianco's proves every day), and I am not inclined to forgive a place for making a pizza as poorly as the last one I got at Stevie's.  Too bad because it is so convenient to where I live."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok.  Nothing great nothing terrible.  We were shopping at the Safeway since we're visiting and stopped in for a bit. Ehh"}
{"text":"Living in vistancia and not having a good pizza place nearby was hard in the beginning. Then these guys opened up... Prayers answered. The prices are fair. The pizza is great though it can be a tad greasy at times. Nothing a handful of napkins cant fix. The owner is a really nice guy. It's become a local hangout for the neighborhood kids on the weekend. Sports...beer...slices.... Stopping into Stevie's for a beer and a couple slices is now a weekend ritual for me. Highly recommended you try them out if you haven't already. If you're feeling adventurous try the Philly pizza or the Buffalo chicken pizza. Definitely a nice break from the norm every once in a while."}
{"text":"love this place! i live in surprise and i have no problem with driving here for some good ol NYC pizza. dough is as good as it gets out here no complaints here keepup the great job steve"}
{"text":"I am writing this as kind of a \"make-up\" review.  I have eaten sandwiches, Pizza, and the antipasto salads for many months now, but have failed to post a review.  Great thin crust pizza.  I love the sauce.  The hot sandwiches are crusty and and always a (good) big meal."}
{"text":"Stevies is very nice to the person named mike R your review is so not true they told you they need the coupon when you came in you dint have it  he could not honor it without the coupon when you said you have six kids to feed steve offed it for free and you took it  so he's not a bad person he's very nice"}
{"text":"I love this place. First tried them at a real estate event and I've been hooked ever since. I drive a half hour each way every weekend for their pizza and wings. I'm from New Jersey so I know good pizza and this is it. A taste of home . Steve and his family have a passion for great food and service. Always friendly. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Hey, Stevie's Giant Pizza with Pepperoni on half and meatball (sliced thin) on the other half is a great crowd pleaser.  Not too heavy with cheese (if you like more, pay for extra cheese), but it is a balanced pie with a neopolitan (Napoli, IT) type crust and it is a mild sauce, with just the right amount of spiciness.   This is a good place for pizza, support local businesses in Vistancia. The wings are decent for West coast, I'm from Buffalo, so 'nuff said on that.  The blue cheese is excellent (and don't get ranch, you West coast people :-) )"}
{"text":"Just tried Stevie's for the first time today. Wings were just okay but the pizza is excellent.. Delicious sauce! Also much needed in this location."}
{"text":"The people are so nice and friendly.  They have a great house salad, but the lasagna is my favorite!  The wine is pretty tasty too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Stevie's a few times and have enjoyed it each time.  We love having a pizza shop local where you can sit and relax and have a glass of wine or beer with dinner.  The owners, Bessa and daughter Violetta, are very friendly.  We even had them join us to eat at one of our visits.  The pizza is delicious and we have also had eggplant parm, meatball and chicken parm sandwiches.  All were cooked to perfection.  My husband even catered my surprise birthday party from them and all the food, eggplant, chicken and baked ziti were outstanding.  It is great to have fellow native New Yorkers in the area making delicious food,  At times we wish they would deliver but then we wouldn't get to see their smiling faces and terrific customer service.  Welcome to Vistancia!  Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, pastas and sandwiches.  Go there 4 or more times a week. Reasonably priced also. Love it."}
{"text":"Pizza has returned to Vistancia! And it couldn't have come sooner in my opinion. I missed the pizza place that previously occupied this space (R.I.P Grande) if only for the option to have pizza and wings close by. What's better is I read some chatter online that said this was to be a sister location to the venue at 59th Avenue and the 101. I had been there before and was very happy with my trip. Things were looking up.  Immediately coming through the door the feel is very different considering what was in this exact location not too long ago. It was warm, inviting, and very pizza joint. You walk up to the counter with the menu hanging up behind it and just start reading left to right. The first thing that I noticed was the variety. Stevie's has sandwiches, wings, calzones, pizza, a list of other things, and something they simply call \"Rolls\". These rolls are really intriguing in their simplicity. It appears to be a sort of cannoli made of dough, cheese, and your choice of fillers such as broccoli, sausage, pepperoni, and a couple of other choices. There are a couple of televisions which not surprisingly had sports playing as well. It was a really good feel. The place being very busy in the first week of their opening had a good vibe as well.  My family went with a sausage, mushroom pizza, 10 barbecue wings, 10 mild wings, and an order of garlic knots. With as busy as it was, the food came pretty quick. It came to the table hot and smelling great. The wings were really good. I take my wings a little crispy and these were a little shy of that, but pretty good. The flavor was pretty spot on albeit a little warm for mild. The barbecue was just my style. A little tangy and full of flavor. The garlic knots were buttery and loaded with garlic. Not to much for this guy, but some might not appreciate that much. Then there was the pizza. This is touted as New York Style Pizza so I will let you decide. It is a thinner slice with smaller more numerous pieces of toppings which were mushroom and sausage in my case. The mushrooms were fresh and the sausage had good flavor. What it didn't have was excessive grease and a fold-able flex. It was baked pretty crispy and kept a good shape while I ate it. I know some like a nice greased up fold-able slice like Grande used to serve. I respect that, but I prefer this style. It was a darn good pie and we all enjoyed it.  Here is the other cent of the two I've got. Ranch. Some call it a sin to dip one's pizza or wings in ranch. I am an occasional dipper. A social dipper. I am not addicted, I swear. I can stop any time I want. Stevie's ranch is a little too much on the buttermilk side and comes in the small cups. I am a big fan of the thicker less oily ranch in the big cups (Barro's is my benchmark on this subject). If you are a purist, disregard my insolence. I know not what I say.   I have to admit, I was mentally comparing Stevie's to the pizza shop that was in this location before. I couldn't resist it. You walk into the same space and your mind can't help but want to see something it had previously. That was a very good thing in this case. The service is so much better, the ambiance is much more welcoming, the prices are super reasonable, and the refills are free! I am very glad that another pizza joint took up the spot of the old. It is just the thing Vistancia needed in my opinion. My gripes are small but my smile is big. Welcome to Vistancia, Stevie's!"}
{"text":"It's a decent, quick pizza spot. Would order again, if I was in a bind. Otherwise, I would rather spend another 20 minutes in the car."}
{"text":"best gluten free pizza ever! a must have :) this place is clean and staff is super friendly! Best NY style pizza!"}
{"text":"I tried the buffalo chicken pizza! Amazing. Definitely one of he best I've tried on the west side."}
{"text":"Wow!  New pizza place opened up in  Vistancia and has great food. Everything is cooked fresh in store so no frozen stuff like others. Highly recommend you try it.    Viloeta helped us and she was amazing!"}
{"text":"This the worst type of place.... I've eaten here about 4 or 5 times now and it is never the same. IDK if they have no recipes or they never buy their stuff at the same place but it always is different. Today we got the same as we always do,  large 1/2 mushrooms 1/2 sausage and it was 10x better than last time. Whatever they did this time they need to do it again."}
{"text":"Three times a charm? Not at this location! First time in, customer service was terrible. The two girls taking orders at the counter complained the entire time about how swamped their were on a Tuesday night and didn't even greet us when we came in.  Second time was a little better, but they change the style of their fried mushrooms than it was the first time we had them.   Last time I will go there was last night unless their management changes. I have ordered the pizza and wing special, extra large with two toppings and a side order of fried mushrooms, 30 bucks. This time I just ordered the special extra large two topping pizza with wings with no side of fried mushrooms, price 30 bucks. It didn't make sense to me and I asked the girl working the counter, who was really sweet, how can it be the same price if I didn't order the extra items of mushrooms, she couldn't figure it put. A older man with a white mustache tried to justify the price by saying he put extra wings in my order, which he lied about. I told him the math didn't add up and he proceeded to get mouthy with me telling me, as I am walking out the door, to give him the pizza back.   I am all about supporting local business but this manager needs to learn math and customer service. I will not be back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"It was good, being from back East and priding myself on good pizza, it was a pleasant surprise. The only problem with the pizza it was lacking in a balance of sauce and cheese. The delivery was quick enough and they got the order spot on. I would revisit ordering again ."}
{"text":"I get pasta (chicken parmesan, beef ravioli, spaghetti & meatballs), and sometimes it's good but sometimes it's bad.  When it's bad, it's always because the pasta in each of the dishes is very undercooked.  It seems like it's about 50/50 (undercooked vs good), and when it's undercooked it's inedible.  I stopped ordering from Stevie's, but I'd definitely order again if they fix the pasta issue."}
{"text":"Super disappointed.  Pizza was bland and tasteless.  Beer labeled as shock top was not that.  Worker was rude and pretty short with customers."}
{"text":"Stevie's is our go to delivery pizza restaurant here in Vistancia. We are not a big fan of chain restaurants, especially when it comes to pizza. Stevie's has unique pizzas like the cheese steak pie which is one of my favorites. If you're in the area we recommend stopping by! If you Live in the area and want some great delivery pizza, we recommend them as well. Not only is their pizza delicious, but their wings are excellent as well."}
{"text":"Delicious highly recommend!! Great staff super friendly, good people, food is amazing, and prices that cant be beat! Love the ricotta cheese pizza and there hand made canollis"}
{"text":"This review is on one menu item only. I have ordered their wings on several occasions. The very first time I ordered their wings, they were the best wings I had ever had. Fresh, crisp, and their wing sauce is the best ever!  Love the sauce!  Unfortunately, in the 10 or so times I've ordered the wings since (always to go), they are soggy and gross (but the sauce is still good and I have no problem eating them!). I can only assume that the wings are cooked earlier in the day and reheated upon receiving an order.  I assume this because I'm always quoted 15 minutes for my pick up time, but when I show up five minutes later, they are sitting there waiting for me.  Stevie's, make these fresh and I'd eat here at least once a week.  Until then, only when I'm desperate or am craving your wing sauce."}
{"text":"I am so happy we live around the corner from Stevie's, but if we didn't I would drive a substantial distance for their ziti in vodka sauce! The staff is great; recently we brought family visiting out of town and enjoyed our food outside. They brought out cinnamon pizza knots dessert for us on the house! Thanks guys! I'm a customer for life!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and broccoli pasta. Comes with a side salad and garlic knots. I asked for the side salad hold the onions and black olives and wanted ranch. When I got home my salad had black olive and Italian dressing! The chicken with broccoli and pasta had NO alfredo sauce!! NONE!  My gosh never was I so disappointed!! It was not like it was busy. I was one of maybe 4 customers11.00 for pasta? And no sauce was not the way you want to come home after work."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is a youngling still that replaced the only pizza parlour in Vistancia that closed about half a year ago. At first, my husband and I instantly thought that this place just changed its name and still had the same menu, but it's a different pizza entirely, and I love it that much more.   Papa John's and Barros are very convenient and they deliver to the Vistancia community, but I love this New York pizza so much more than the so called \"Chicago style\" Barros pizza (which it's really not), that I don't mind driving here to get it instead of having other pizzas delivered.   Instead of serving soggy large slices, the slices have a texture similar to Peter Piper. I know that sounds bad, but despite the thinness, the slices actually have substance, which is a really good thing. But you know how Peter Piper has the stigma that people are afraid to admit that they like it, well, Stevie's Pizza actually has the real  taste to back it up. You can tell the ingredients are fresh, and even the staff is proud to serve it. (It seemed like the previous pizza place that this one replaced, the staff hated being there, but I noticed the staff at this new one actually cares about being there).  There's something to be said about service and food quality going hand in hand and that's the reason we keep returning here.   I'd say even for people who don't live in the Vistancia community, it is worth the drive out here to try this New York style pizza. It's a refreshing change compared to the hundreds of pizza chains out there."}
{"text":"I had such an awful experience. I've never been here before or had their food. I ordered through the phone for pick up. I was rushed to get my order in and the lady tried to hang up on me before I could even ask for the total amount (since I don't know the total with tax).   I went by to pick the order, was greeted fine. I tell this balding older man I'm here for a pick up. He asks, \"The two pizzas?\" I said yes with a salad. He then cuts me off mid sentence to say, \"yeah yeah whatever.\" He goes to the back to get the salad so I look through the menu one more time and he comes back to tell me, \"move where I can see you.\"   I will never come here again. This serve was down right awful and what made it worse, I was with my 6yr old brother and he had to sit through and listen to this. The pizza is not even that good!"}
{"text":"Pizza looked great. Crust was too soft as each slice bent down from the bottom edge to the edge of the crust. The edge crust was the best. Tomato sauce very bland. Cheese lacked flavor. Sausage was good. Pepperoni was ok. Pizza crust slippery undercooked under the cheese. Good presentation but product disappointing."}
{"text":"The pizza, wings, and broccoli roll were very tasty. If you are in the mood for delicious NY style pizza, then you will not be disappointed at Stevie's in Vistancia!"}
{"text":"I like the feel of Stevie's. Everyone's nice and it seems family owned which I love to support! The pizza is really good whether it be their lunch special or ordering a full pizza. We tried their garlic bread and it was not good. It's a load of bread with some sort of butter/chopped up garlic spread. The bread and butter was great but it was literally bits of garlic all over. Don't understand what that is but I was very unhappy with that order. Now I know not to order that."}
{"text":"This place seems to have quality issues and seems to forget part of the order or mess up the order fairly often. I always get the white broccoli pizza and we picked it up and had it delivered about two dozen times. Every couple times we order the pizza we get a red sauce pizza and we call and the old guy(owner?) is rude. Tonight my wife stopped by and she picked up a pizza. The pizza was a red sauce pizza which was incorrect and they forget our salad dressing. My wife called and tried to get the order fixed and the guys daughter told her that she could come pick up a new pizza, however she would be charged. I heard that and called them immediately and I get a young guy on the phone who puts me on hold and then I get the owner. The owner tells me its not his fault and its my wifes fault for not ordering the pizza. I told him that this happen pretty often and that it happened to me last time. The guy said \"if you don't order it right I cant make it right\" and I told him I ordered it correctly last time and that they still managed to screw up the order..  You will notice this complaint in the other reviews of this place.    Food 6 out of 10(when its correct) Service 3 out of 10"}
{"text":"I was working in the strip mall here and this place was recommended to me, although for the pizza and not the eggplant Parmesan that I ended up having. The lunch slices looked like they had been sitting out for awhile so I went with the sandwich. The cook (owner?) was so not into answering questions (he reminded me of the soup nazi from Seinfeld). He did say that he makes the sandwiches fresh but I'm skeptical of the fried eggplant, not very fresh tasting, also a little over cooked, almost burnt. Tomato sauce was tasty but not enough of it.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love the Glendale location, so I decided to try out this location since it's closer to home. I called about delivery and was greeted with an unpleasant woman's voice. It seemed I was burdening her on a Friday night with a delivery order. I told her my order and the rudeness persisted, so I ultimately passed on the order and called Barros instead. I'm sure the pizza is as good as the other location, but I choose to give business to places that want it."}
{"text":"I was frantic trying to find someone that morning who could deliver 5 pizzas by 11am. They answered the phone at 10:15am and had my 5 pizzas ready for pick up ON TIME. They were quite good as well. The white spinach pizza and the bbq chicken pizza were loved by all and so was the giant cheese, pepperoni and special.   The service is above and beyond. They helped carry everything out to my car, they made sure to ask if I needed plates and cups, napkins...I would definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"Great family owned business. They made us an outstanding Italian sub sandwich on a toasted bun. The restaurant is clean with multiple TV screens to watch your favorite sports team. They also do pizza and salads."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Love that this place delivers now. Only recommendation is to offer more gluten free option."}
{"text":"The pizza is horrible. Very little cheese, the sauce has no flavor and the dough tastes stale. Hoping for a different pizza place in Vistancia."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I have had in many years.  I have managed multiple customer service restaurants or stores and this is the worst ever.  As someone that believes in word of mouth advertising I feel obligated to share my experience.  If I were the manager on duty I would have fired one of the servers on staff and placed another on a final based on their demeanor when approached by myself trying to give feedback.  The owners Son who was placed in charge while his Dad was out on a family emergency was uncooperative and took absolutely no responsibility for his actions or for those of his employees.  I expressed to him that if his father knew the experience would he be satisfied and he stated yes.  They had a server on staff completing their last day with the business and when we inquired about our order she replied with, \"it's not my concern.\" I was appalled and hoped to share this with them and express my concern for their business.  My thoughts were why would you even allow someone with such a bad approach to even interact with your customers he had nothing to say other than his father would not agree and would be satisfied with our level if service. When my father in law tried to speak about his order he was agreed away and told that since I was spoken to it dies not matter.   It is sad since this is an area that blows through businesses quickly and this one will not last at this rate.  I do not recommend eating there if you are hungry as they tease you with food since they do not know where food belongs and try to serve your food to other tables.  I almost had the chance to eat at least 6 other tables food while waiting an hour for 3 calzones and One slice of pepperoni.  My family was starving and needless to say once we received our food we were famished.   Food was ehhhhhhh but we ate.  I am very disappointed in the service and lack of accountability.  It does not even deserve one star."}
{"text":"Love the food here; the real deal.  Stevie and Joey are from the old country (Jersey!). The fettuccini alfredo was rich, creamy and a large portion so the wife and I split it. We love their Italian sub sandwich and the veggie pizza we just had was delightful. Fresh dough pizza like they use at Stevie's makes a huge difference. They've some beers on tap and some wines. Eat in, carry out or delivery in Vistancia and surrounding area."}
{"text":"\"It's not delivery, it's Stevie's Pizza\" This place feels like a small town Mom and Pop shop. The kitchen is open with a very clean look.  The pizza came out piping hot and clearly fresh but seemed too close to a pizza from a grocery store.  Not enough sauce, not enough cheese, pepperoni from a bag maybe? Covered in grease BUT the crust was wonderful.  It's a bit too pricey at about $15 per pizza or $2.50 a slice. Beer served on tap however which is always a plus.  Cute place to go with Mom but might as well grab a frozen pizza from a store."}
{"text":"Great food! Love this place. Service is fantastic and restraunt is clean. Love coming here."}
{"text":"Best NYC pizza in the area for sure!   Tried the entire menu and have no complaints.  Always greeted warmly when entering and the delivery is acceptable."}
{"text":"My wife and i have ordered from Stevie's multiple times and never had an experience like we did Monday night. The pizza was cold and my wife ended up throwing up all night... one day later i believe i had food Posion because i spent all Tuesday in the restroom. Wanted to post this in case anyone else had the same problem with Stevie's, but for sure never ordering from them again"}
{"text":"I tried the family calzone which was ok. The big surprise is the online menu had it at $13.00 the price I was charged was over $30.00 delivered. Way out of line for a calzone"}
{"text":"Consistently great pizza, wings, calzones and sandwiches.  It's great having Stevies nearby for a planned dinner or pick up on the way home from work."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot after cycling 20-25 miles threwout vistancia. I love to sit outside and enjoy the weather and great views. The food is good and priced well."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok. Stopped in for lunch a couple of times and they offer decent lunch specials.  Surprisingly they offer a slice of pizza with any toppings you want. Normally for a slice, pizza places have limited options. Come to find out they take a basic piece of cheese pizza already baked and throw some toppings on it and toss it back in the oven instead of it being fresh and baked from scratch.  Ultimately it had zero flavor and tasted like leftover pizza that had been heated several times.  I ordered spinach topping and it wasn't fresh spinach but out of a can!  Just weird. Owner isn't particularly friendly either so I most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Yes for Stevie's Pizza.      The staff are so nice and the food is great..Pizza is very good as well as.  The sausage roll and antipasto salad.   Were. Pleased and have been back several times and never disappointed. Great addition to our small community"}
{"text":"Their pizza is so good! We went the night before we headed out to Disneyland. We live in Vistancia and usually stop at Safeway once a week. This was the first time we tried this restaurant and it was delicious! The guys who were working are really friendly. it looks like it'd be a great place to go for pizza and beers for football season."}
{"text":"I always like trying new pizza joints whenever spotted Stevie's was delicious to say the least, customer service was excellent the delivery driver \"Cubs logo on back window\" was very pleasant to deal with my pizza and wings were absolutely amazing only small complaint would be that the pizza was slightly warm most likely from the drive which I understand since they delivered kinda fat cant do anything about that but overall 10/10 Thanks guys I'll be having you in the future!!"}
{"text":"We ordered from Stevie's a couple of weeks ago because we are fairly new to the area and were hoping to find a good pizza place close by, but we were extremely disappointed.  We ordered a pizza and anti pasta salad and were disappointed with both.  The pizza crust was flavorless.  I am a fan of both thin and thick crust pizza, so the fact that this was a thin crust pizza that tasted more like cardboard than pizza crust was just the beginning.  The sauce was flavorless as well, so add that to a cardboard crust makes for a bad pizza.  The pepperoni was good, but the sausage tasted more like the kind of sausage that was served on pizza I was served in elementary school.  Very institutional tasting.  The anti pasta salad had almost all meat and very little salad. I can't speak for other dishes that they serve, but I will not be going back for the pizza.  If, I could give this place zero stars I would."}
{"text":"The owner, one of the nicest guys your ever going to meet. Anyways the food top notch best pizza place around for miles. I would definitely recommend the calzone and the family calzone is humongous"}
{"text":"Average and customer service could use some help. Owner should stay in back and put some smiling faces up front."}
{"text":"horrible service worst customer service I have ever experienced. Pizza was not was was ordered and when I called the man was very rude and could careless. the vegetables looked old and it did not have that much cheese."}
{"text":"When it comes to pizza, my expectations are a hot pie stuck together with great cheese. For me, the pizza was over sauced and messy. The staff was great. The pizza? Not my favorite"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch with my family to check out the \"local\" restaurant in Vistancia. My girls shared a plate of ziti with marinara and my husband and I both ordered pepperoni and cheese calzones and an order of mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were \"okay\" they were a little on the done side. My girls loved the pasta and the calzone was tasty. I will say I have never had a calzone with ricotta cheese in it before. The verdict is still out on whether I would get it again, but we will probably be back to try the pizza once we move."}
{"text":"Grew up in 20 minutes outside of Manhattan in New Jersey so I am a pizza connoisseur this pizza was practically average it had the look the place had the look but didn't have that amazing taste or flavor of a true East Coast Pizza. The mens room was absolutely disgusting The sink had stains in it like they've been there for months along with everything else.   They talk the talk but don't walk the walk."}
{"text":"Tried Stevie's for the first time as we are new to the area, actually new to Arizona. Had the bones-less ckicken wings, an antipasto salad and then a pepperoni and sausage  pizza. All the food was quite good. The salad was fresh with lots of vegis and not just lettuce. The pizza is New York style so you have to like the large pieces and thin foldable crust, which i love. This reminded me of my favorite pizza, John's in NYC. While not that, it certainly was a very good pizza. Lots if toppings and a reasonable price. There is a very minimal charge for delivery. Will definately go there again."}
