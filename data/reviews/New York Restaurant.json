{"text":"I don't know, maybe I have different expectations than these previous reviewers. First, I would barely call this a restaurant.  This is a takeout joint with very average dishes, good meaty spare ribs are the exception.  These owners are not, I repeat not prepared for actual sitdown diners. My order was spare ribs, a soup, a main dish, and fried rice.  It arrived on paper plates and minimum takeout style plastic knife and fork, in this order...soup, then fried rice, then main dish, then spare ribs, all on the table at once, all on paper plates and those minimum paper napkins that are so small that one grab and you are done.   In other words, the cook I guess assumes all the dishes are for takeout and they all come out as they may.  This food is not served..it is just brought out as it may, .I had to get up to get my Coke from the fridge. So the symphony of food was confusing and really not a big deal at all. Now if you are taking out, I guess it's OK. Spare ribs, as noted were very meaty, egg drop soup was OK as well, including the familiar crackers. The rice was acceptable...shrimp was just perfect in the rice. Shrimp and scallops in garlic sauce had a great shortage of both shrimp and scallops....lots of broccoli, should have been called broccoli with shrimp and scallops. Decor is non-existant, service is generally dependent on how high and often you can raise your hand. Seems no one is in charge of the tables...everyone is takeout oriented perhaps as it should be.  It is after all a takeout place. Unremarkable at best, unacceptable as a sit down restaurant. I mean, paper plates and plastic forks?  My friend's spring roll came served in a bag...like I said, this is strictly a take out joint. Has a TV. A 27 inch Sony affair from the post war era.  Snowy reception included. And the funniest thing is they kind of know it.  Our bill was $ 39, gave them two twenties and a five for the tip and they told us we paid too much....meaning they never expected a tip at all. Like i said...a take out joint."}
{"text":"I only order fried rice here, because I'm not a fan of shopping center Chinese restaurants, and know that most of the dishes are  batter fried lumps of meat in a salty, sweet, sour sauce with maybe a few vegetables-- which ain't my idea of Chinese food.  I get fried rice and ask for extra helping of fresh veggies mixed in, for which I offer $2 more, and always get a good count.  It's always OK, but for some reason, sometimes it's really amazingly good.  Nearly every time I go in there's a different cook, so that may be the reason.  The people are very nice, and food is fast, cheap, and plentiful.  Their veggie soup is top drawer too.  Don't know about General Tso's chicken-- and don't care."}
{"text":"Good and fast.  If you need a quick fix on some Chinese this is the spot.  Friendly service.  Try the chicken and broccoli."}
{"text":"My Go-to choice for Chinese in Cornelius. Very friendly and family owned. Good tasting with no msg."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in LKN area. Never disappointed with the take out we get.  They speak English well too!"}
{"text":"Searching for a late evening place to eat with not much to choose from we thought we'd give this place a try.  What a great surprise!  So good in fact we went back for New Year's Eve! I don't think many people eat at the restaurant but there was a steady line of customers getting take-out.  We had the crab Rangoon's, won ton soup, Hunan Beef, Seafood Trio, the Sweet and Sour Shrimp, and Egg rolls.  All the food was very good and had lots of flavor - the sweet & sour sauce is made in the restaurant daily.  The brown sauce on the side is also amazing!  The egg rolls were a little overcooked but still - it's fried Chinese!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place because I have not found a great Chinese restaurant since moving here. Unfortunately it's not here and I am still on the look.   I ordered general tso's which might not have had actual chicken under the breading.  It was exceptionally dry although I could imagine it might have had good flavor 3-4 days ago when it was fresh.   This came with fried rice which had a very heavy smoke flavoring which was unfortunate. The meal also came with an egg roll which is my favorite but this egg roll was simply awful. It had a strong and distinct flavor which I think of as an msg flavor but I really don't know what it is.  I just know it was yucky. Lastly, I ordered crab Rangoon which were cooked perfectly but the crab mixture was dessert level sweet which failed to hit the mark."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. Good portions.  Good price.  But...... The customer service is terrible.  Very quick almost a little too much attitude from the guy ( owner ) Other than that it's great"}
{"text":"The food is great. Their potions are large which is a plus. I usually pick up my orders and they are usually ready within 10 minutes.  Tip: don't forget the soy sauce when picking up orders. They will not put it in the bag for you!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Dinner tonight was scallion chicken, sesame chicken and beef & broccoli.   Mediocre at best - very bland.   What really upset me is the ultra small dinner servings.   Normal Chinese is served in clamshell or large round bowls with clear top.  These portion were in tiny square divided trays.  On top of that, the cost was $1 or $2 more than other local places.   I specifically asked if the dinner combos were larger than the lunch and was told yes.   I hate to see the lunch serving size.   Very upset with my blown $32."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food that I've had in NC. We moved from MI 7 months ago and it's been difficult finding a new place, but I think we finally hit pay dirt  very tasty won ton soup and the chicken fried rice was awesome. They used fresh ingredients! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch not expecting much.  But the staff and food was really good!  Will be back for sure.  Wish they had delivery.  Had the Sa cha chicken spring roll and fried rice.  Ask for the hot oil sauce if you want to make it more spicy."}
{"text":"Learn English, you should know what chicken fried rice is!!!!! You claim only white rice you have!!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Interior is lacking and needs updating. Service was quick. Not a place I would come back to."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Chinese food in Lake Norman. Locally owned and operated, real family business. The food is always fresh and delicious, a regular take out for my family. We are a family of 5, 3 teenage boys, and the amount of food you receive for the price is incredible. Great customer service as well. All around 5 stars...don't miss out."}
{"text":"First timers as we only noticed it when we went to Village Inn pizza. Even though our order was missing the egg roll and the spring roll, I have to say it's still the best Chinese in the area. If they delivered, we'd probably get it once a week. I was impressed by how crispy the scallion chicken was and the egg drop soup tasted fresh and not greasy."}
{"text":"Friendly quick servive. Meal 9 bucks. Very clean shop  Meal tastes perfect.  Simple but pure"}
{"text":"Good cheap Chinese food, large portions. Always a favorite nearby option. Crab Rangoon here are probably some of my favorite in the area."}
{"text":"Get your grease on.  I love the food here not because it is quality but rather they excel in going all out into the greasy fake Americanized Chinese food.  Don't let the name fool you, this is not a pizza place, they serve Chinese food.  I had the Lo Mein and the Fried Dumplings.  Both coated my entire mouth with a thick layer of oily grease goodness.  They cook the spare ribs too much for my taste.  My fellow enthusiasts had a garlic chicken dish and enjoyed it but then had a simultaneous stomach ache.  This is probably a fluke but if you have one let me know."}
{"text":"For a Chinese take out restaurant... this is a solid 4.    Don't expect any glitz or glamour here... and don't expect to walk in and review them on the facilities.  If you are sitting and dining, you aren't going to appreciate this illustrious Corn-town cuisine for what it is... or maybe that will just add to the experience for you.  The facility is what you think of any typical walk-in Chinese restaurant. Small, old booths, carpet that needs updating... yaknow, the usual.  It is what it is.  The food... is... bomb as bump... For quick, greasy, Chinese food.  My 33 year old dad-bod self was feeling 22 again last night and hit the town pretty hard.  Well, as hard as you can in Cornelius.  Feeling sub-par and needing some afternoon comfort food today, NY Restaurant was first on my mind.  I called ahead and ordered the Vegetable Lo Mein.  VLM has been my favorite Chinese dish since high school and NYR doesn't disappoint.  Salty enough to soak up any questionable decisions from the night before and flavorful enough to put a smile on my face while I sit on the couch and watch teeny bopper high school movies.  In the past, when I would order Chicken Lo Mein, it would be pumped full of chicken... the veggie option could use a few more vegetables.  There were 5 delicious pieces of broccoli along with some onions and mushrooms.  Other than that, #yumyum #nomnom.  With any Chinese restaurant... If you get rice, I always suggest white rice over fried rice, btw  Some other items I've loved:  Singapore Mei Fun Egg Drop Soup Crab Rangun"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS, Chinese Take-out!!!! I've eaten here with my family, maybe 20 times last couple of years & its ALWAYS been GREAT!!! I also, like to use COUPONS and they usually have several good ones,right on the takeout menu. Its just OK, to sit in and eat(kinda bland decor, with simple booths) we just mainly, do the TAKEOUT, & once again,its ALWAYS been DELICIOUS & I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"These people, this place... They know how to make THE most delicious Chinese food!! Their prices are great and the take out food they create is close to the best I've ever eaten! (and yes I love Chinese food Sunday's)!! I would highly recommend anyone in the area try this food for some yummy comfort foods! The one negative is that the place is sorta dumpy, so although it doesn't matter to me, you probably wouldn't want to \"eat in\""}
{"text":"I recently moved here from New Jersey and heard the Chinese food in NC doesn't compare to NJ.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the food at New York Restaurant.  The portion size was large, the prices were reasonable and the food tasted very good.  I ordered the boneless ribs and they were tender and had little fat on them. I will definitely go back and try other items.  They really should change their name so people will know it is a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"We were surprised how good the food was. We will have to sample a few more dishes to give a more informed review."}
{"text":"Really picky about take out, so had to get a few recommendations on this place. I was not disappointed. Damn near like up north, except it's not on the corner!! Fast, good flavor, fair prices.. The general chicken is my go to. Always light, juicy, and with a lil kick like I like. The house fried rice has been a fab of mine too. Although I did get egg foo yung once that was a bit over cooked.. Now if you know, everyone has different styles on that dish anyway. It wasn't bad thought, compared to other take Chinese takeouts in this area, this is the place to go. Don't waste your time with the others, get here and get your order in, generous portions, dishes can be spiced up by request, and then have lunch and dinner combos !! The Singapore Mai fun will surprise you too!! Ive had quite a few items and they definitely do it up with a \"NY Style\", so try something new or get your regular, but just check this spot out next time your in the area. Friendly, greetings and good hot fresh takeout joint. Open till 11 sat/sun too!!"}
{"text":"i just had a craving for quick, easy Chinese food. Did a quick Yelp search, and found this place. A $6 lunch meal that had enough food for two? I'm down for it.   I ordered the scallion chicken (I asked for the opinion of the girl who was working there) lunch portion, and it was delicious!   The inside of the restaurant doesn't have any bells or whistles. It's small and plain. But when I want quick Chinese food, I don't really care about the ambience, just the food. I'll be back and order more of the scallion chicken, maybe another couple of orders...."}
