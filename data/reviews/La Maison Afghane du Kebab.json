{"text":"The best afghan food in Montreal. Great taste and reasonable price. I highly recommend this restaurant.
We go there once a month and I still can't resist going there."}
{"text":"We were highly recommended this place by some Afghani friends so decided to give it a try (seeing as it is in the South Shore).

Formerly known as 'Kabul,' the restaurant has been going for about 10 years but recently re-branded and moved to this location. The interior has an Indian/Middle-Eastern feel - it is simple yet cosy and comfortable.

We entered around 9.30pm and were the last customers of the day (they close at 10). I was afraid we would not get served but the staff were super kind and hospitable, despite it being close to closing time!

Our order consisted of Mantoo for starters followed by the grill platter for two. The mantoo was too delicious, from the impeccable way it was presented to it's delicious taste. Dumplings stuffed with aromatic ground meat that is smothered in yoghurt sauce... A must to try!
The grill was extremely good and made to perfection. We had a plate of grilled chicken skewers, filet mignon and lamb skewers which we both devoured and enjoyed to the maximum. The platter was accompanied by Afghani pilaw - basmati rice with vegetables and raisins and Afghani naan bread - delicious!

Overall, I was highly impressed by the quality and taste of food and will definitely be back!"}
