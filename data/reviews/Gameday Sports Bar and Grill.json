{"text":"So.....I spot this place off of Bell Road and am intrigued.
My wife and I decide that a sports bar to watch the Suns play would be fun...why not?
Whatever this place used to be, I think an old Mieneke or Jiffy Lube cause of the garage doors, it looks good now.   Nice fresh paint, plenty of TV's with crisp pictures, and a decent bar are something you notice right away...Now, I didn't try the food, but I am sure I will...one day?!?!?
Typical bar fare, i.e. wings, burger, fries, were available, but here's the kicker:
For all of the TV's and satellite connections what happens at 7:00pm?
NO SUNS GAME!!!!
Are you kidding????????
I'll give it a second chance, but that may be it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice sports bar, but they don't seem to know when a big game is on which is weird for a sports bar. We've had to ask them to turn on the Suns game, and when #1 TU vs #2 Tx Tech were playing they didn't have it on, we had to ask a couple times. With that said, they have a $1.50 happy hour which simply can't be beat."}
{"text":"Minus one star for all the Steeler's paraphernalia and tiny patio. I felt claustrophobic outside, if that's even possible!! The bar was empty except for the patio. Bartender was easy on the eyes and made some good drinks.It was open mic last night, there was good talent playing a good mix of covers it was nice. We were too late to try any food but supposedly its all made from scratch I will be back to try some of that healthy bar food very soon. I would def come here again to watch the Raiders lose on Gameday!! ;)"}
