{"text":"The staff were very nice the food was good the presentation was subpar. Mind you in a food snob"}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant in south Etobicoke that delivers. Great depth of flavours in the pasta. Perfectly done rapini. Warm service and space, Dedicated staff - two brother operation. One host, one chef. Frank a great guy.nice fig cake!Will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere.  Very reasonable prices. I love the one page menu that has many choices.  Most expensive item is $22.  This restaurant only 10 tables, so if you want to dine at 7 PM; make a reservation!  Home made pasta, gluten-free items a specialty.  Tastefully decorated with lovely background music."}
{"text":"The atmosphere tries to be quaint...I rather liked the close quarters though hubby thought it was too outdated.
I would return for the beautiful italian food. I haven't had such perfectly cooked gnocchi in years. Melt in my mouth marvelous.
I dare you not to close your eyes when you taste the vegie & goat cheese appetizer. Go ahead and close them, just savour the flavours of grilled eggplant, reduced balsamic, warm goat cheese....mmmmm. Its a memory now, a warm yummy memory.
One negative I must warn about. I will simply say...pomposity. Sigh....so unnecesary - just leave me to my food please."}
{"text":"Love this place. Nice and cozy, and the food is consistently amazing.  The service is phenomenal - and they recork your wine!"}
{"text":"Don't know why it's not that busy, but great local place. Really authentic Italian food and quality food. Frank is the best and very accommodating. Only reason not 5 stars as atmosphere is quiet. But if going for quiet and quaint and quality,  great!!!"}
{"text":"Came to Pazzia for a casual Saturday afternoon lunch with a friend.  The waiter at first was cordial.  He listed off some off menu specials of which I ordered a Parm style Portobello mushroom and spinach dish.  My main, the shrimp fettuccini for $18.99 was over saturated with anchovy paste and laden with pungent frozen shrimp.   After finishing our meals we were asked for we'd like coffee or dessert, upon polity replying \"no thank you\" we were met with the 
deathliest stare and silent from our server.  Furthermore I left about a ML drop of beer in my glass, after originally clearing the glass off the table the waiter came back with the glass and requested me to finish the rest (seriously the amount in the glass wouldn't have gotten a bee drunk). Upon getting the bill we realized we had been overcharged for our mains as well as charged $11.99 for ONE Portobello mushroom.  Overall very awkward experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the place seems not that fancy but it doesn't need to be! The food is fantastic, authentic and very tasty.  The owners come around the tables to make sure all is ok. Good job guys! Molto bene! Btw if u enjoy seafood try the fettuccine pescatore."}
{"text":"Had to kill time in the area. 
It happened to be dinner time and I found myself in front of Pazzia. 

My first impression of the place was that it was really cute ! When we first walked in, there were no other patrons. I was worried, but it would have been too awkward to walk out. Thankfully we decided to stay! Within about 15 minutes of noting the fact that we were the only patrons, more people came in. By the time we left, Pazzia was at full capacity. 

The owner-chefs are your servers as well. They were super friendly.

Prices are very reasonable! We ordered: two appetizers (bruschetta, salad); two bottles of sparking water; two generous portioned entrees (pollo parmigiana, shrimp angel hair pasta); and lattes. All this plus a tip was under $100.

If this place wasn't so far from my house I'd be here everyday.
I really enjoyed my dining experience here and would definitely recommend Pazzia if you're jonesing for Italian and if you're in the area.

FYI - After 6 pm, parking along Loma Road is free."}
{"text":"Great little spot - very intimate. Service was excellent and the food was really tasty!"}
{"text":"Crowded with nice crowd.
Treatment the best- Frank is A-1+
And Milano!
Non greasy nicely dryish sausage/ they get rapini Right.Breaded 'shrooms just subpar.Cod-good. Angel hair wi shrimp with subtle but deep garlic sauce send one nearly to the moon; even better the second day. Crespelle Florentine with rose sauce; cloud-like , the sauce being a perfect compliment .
 Semifredo pistachio ,great ( tiny sparse crunchy caramel topping intelligent and effective) 
Wine list was limited limited and needs some  upgrading. Comp digestives rounded out a warm satisfying experience"}
{"text":"This is my favourite \" comfort food restaurant\".
The food is delicious. I love the creespelle rose and spicy linguine with shrimp. This is a small quaint family owned restaurant. If you are looking for an enjoyable evening out without to much fuss, come here relax and enjoy."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time there...gnocchi sauce was supposed to be combo of camembert and gorgonzola. if there was gorgonzola in the house it was certainly missing in my sauce. It still tasted great but a let down from what I had expected...that sharp blue cheese bite. Got a lecture when I commented. Did not appreciate being lectured to about my order.
NIce place but service attitude is arrogance first.
Plenty of other places to spend my money."}
{"text":"Service was top notch! We took our three little girls there so our server was considerate enough to bring their food out quickly. They loved their pizza and pasta and devoured it. My husband and I shared the portobello Parmesan with spinach which was delicious. My husband enjoyed his pasta primavera. I ordered the crespelle with spinach and ricotta which was good but had an eggy flavour. The kids got complementary mini biscottis to eat in the car. Although the decor is dated and it seems to cater to the retired/senior crowd, we would go back."}
