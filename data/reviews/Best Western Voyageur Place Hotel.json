{"text":"This is one of the cleanest hotel's I have ever stayed at. Just remember to check the alarm clock before going to sleep,  day of check-in,  since the one in our room went off at 5:15am."}
{"text":"FRIENDLIEST staff ever!!!  Erin and Shelley were incredible. We needed to change our date a few times and it was never a problem. They even upgraded us!  After arriving at Pearson after 12 hours of flying, we called to confirm our reservation and we're told they'd get our room ready for us immediately, though it was much earlier than the regular check-in time.  Our room was large and the bed was incredibly comfortable. It was perfect for us to get caught up on all our missed sleep. Highly recommended.  Thank you again!"}
{"text":"The Best Western Newmarket is a pleasant and clean hotel, which is fortunate since it's kind of the only big player in town! It's walking distance to a drugstore for incidentals and a liqueur store for essentials. They offer a continental breakfast, complimentary via many business booking, in the conjoining restaurant: The Buttery."}
