{"text":"This place was nice on the eyes... an that's were it stopped. After being seated it had taken a while to place orders, we didn't get bread until we asked for it as we happened to catch the waitress walking passed. Then we got bread an side salad with the meal. There was a weird smell coming from the butter an shortly after not finishing half of my meal, I felt sick an resulted in vomit. I love trying new things but I regret to say the service as well as food gets a thumbs down for me."}
{"text":"Love creekside they do an amazing job with their service.  I come at least twice a week and the bartenders do an amazing job. I don't even have to order my drink they just remember and handle it for me. Great service and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I were in Ohio for a endurance car race (www.lemonscar19.com).  After the race, and eating nothing but fast food for the last 3 days we needed a nice sit down restaurant.   Of course we found the Creekside on Yelp!, and decided to give it a try.   Definitely a five star for the price.   The food was very good.   The service was great.   If I ever find myself near Brecksville, OH again I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The potatoes have tasted like lighter fluid the last 2 times. Salads are made with part of the lettuce that is bitter and should be thrown out. Pizza is good but comes partially burned. It's scary."}
{"text":"This place is great.  It is not a place to travel miles for, but if you're in Brecksville and looking for some good food--this is the place.  I've never had bad food or service here.  The pizza is great.  I'm from New York and Ohio pizza is always a bit of a let down.  Creekside has decent Ohio pizza. Everything else I've had here has been flavorful and properly cooked. Service has been friendly.  Reasonable prices.  It is a great place to bring family or a lunch meeting.  The restaurant is clean and tastefully decorated."}
{"text":"Love sitting on the patio on a nice evening. Nice atmosphere inside as well. Food is always good and great portions for the price. Can't go wrong with their pizzas or burgers!! Been to a few private events here and always felt well taken care of!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 3 stars only because the food was great. not great service, but will give another try because we know its like to have an off day.   We are restaurant/bar manager owners in Cleveland and this experience was very unfortunate.  We were really looking forward to our visit to Creekside because of the ambiance and great patio setting.  We were greeted by the hostesses and they both seemed concerned about which server would take our table, however it seemed very empty.  We were greeted quickly by our server and asked what we would like to drink.  There is an extensive drink list, so we needed a minute to look over the menu.  Our waitress returned and took our drink order and once she returned, about 10 minutes later to deliver drinks, we place our order for the appetizer and entrees.  The appetizer, flat bread was great and came out quick.  About 30 minutes from our food order, we both has empty drinks, empty plates and empty waters and had not seen our server since the appetizer was delivered.  Many others servers walked by on multiple occasions and none of them bothered to ask anything or take and pates off of our table.    We wanted to order a bottle of sparkling, so unfortunately I had to go inside and find our server to place this order.  Once she brought the bottle out, already opened because she was nervous to open it(little tip: bring another serve or bartender to the table and have them open it for us) we had still not received our food.  I mentioned to her that it had been quite long for a medium burger and salmon, and she completely ignored my comment.  The food finally came and other than my husbands burger cooked well done rather than medium(food sat in the service window for a long time) we can't complain.   We have heard that this place is amazing and really wanted to try it out, unfortunately for us, our service was sub par and hopefully a fluke.  We of course will giver the place and our server another try because we know of all people what it is like to have an off night.  I would reference the server, but she did not even tell us her name."}
{"text":"We live very close to Creekside and frequent the restaurant often. We love the 3-4-5 menu - happy hour appetizers and drink specials for $3, $4, or $5 (good until 6pm). We also like to go on Tuesday nights for Clear the Cellar where any overstocked wine is put on sale - we've seen bottles for under $10. Pizza - phenomenal!  And I highly recommend the triple chocolate torte. If you get a chance say hi to the bartender, Jack. He'll treat you right!"}
{"text":"Definitely a family favorite! Anytime I take my family out to dinner I pick this place. The environment is so inviting and the servers are always so sweet. Also, the food is great quality and priced perfectly. I HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"I cannot make it a zero so they get one star.  The food is so poor except for their pizzas.  They have so little competition they must not think they need to have good food.  So I just tried breakfast and it is also very bad.  So bad my kids did not eat the greasy half cooked bacon with gross grease in it   This place continues to be bad and no one knows why.  Burt wood opens up and is packed 24-7 because at least u know u will get good food.   Eddies has a great location but I sure wish they would find a chef who can cook.  It is pretty simple thing to do.    Don't go here unless you want croaky food.  It could easily be turned around so quickly if they wanted to do so   Have gone to creekside again and things did not change but friendlier server.  Pizza is still the best in brecksville and good bar to hang out"}
{"text":"Mother's Day ruined. I am saddened by the fact that I will no longer be coming here. I enjoyed coming here and enjoying the great ambience, but the disrespect of the staff prevents me from coming here. We waited almost an hour to get our breakfast food on Mother's day. There was no apology about the long wait until we prompted by asking about our food several times. I talked to the manager about our long wait, and I received a half apology and an attitude that I should just accept it since there were larger groups being tended to. It would have been nice to have someone come by our table and explain the situation with the long wait and apologize without us having to prompt them. Instead, the staff and manager were scurrying around to prepare the dining room for the dinner crowd and tending to the larger parties. I guess our party of 4 was inconsequential. By the time we received our food, the dining area was almost empty. We picked the restaurant because we thought it would be a nice place to celebrate our mother. But to our surprise, the true attitudes of this restaurant came out and ruined what was supposed to be a special day."}
{"text":"Pleasant experience for an early dinner.  Location may initially be difficult to find as it is in a building shared with other businesses but there is a sign.  Large bar opens into a bright and clean dining room and extends on to a patio overlooking a shady brook.  Nicely done menu appears serviceable and not overdone.  Mostly standard fare for appetitizers though a lobster quesadilla caught our eye.  Ingredients were fresh and taste was good.  Our server Bonnie knew her craft and product, making some excellent recommendations.  Main course this time included the turkey burger that I asked for with goat cheese and a chicken cibatta sandwich.  There are certain entries on the menu that are marked as customer favorites.  I opted for potato pancakes instead of the standard fries and it was not disappointing.  Freshly made and tasty.  The burger was excellent as well, served on a pretzel roll.  The chicken sandwich was prepared with arugla and mushrooms and provelone, served with a peppercorn mayo.  French fries were unimpressive.  Bonnie's service was excellent.  Only poor mark would be given to hostess who seemed preoccupied with something else and made no real effort to greet or seat us.  I will likely return for some other samplings.  Would like to see a larger draft beer selection or hope they change it regularly.  They advertise a number of specials and I am drawn to discounts as well."}
{"text":"The Brecksville dining scene is pretty small with only a few options, and I think this place tends to be underrated; it actually is my favorite Brecksville restaurant.  The menu is extensive but not overwhelming and the food is always great (other than happy hour - see end of my review), and the place is really pretty inside with big windows providing a great view of the creek behind the restaurant.  It would be a good local place to take a date.    Of all things, I really enjoy their pizza, it is actually one of my favorite pizzas in Cleveland.  On Thursdays they do a 2 for the price of one deal, so I like to grab 2 pizzas to go for carry out.    I also like to stop by here for happy hour drinks when I'm in Brecksville.  The bartenders are friendly and helpful and will go out of their way for you to make your drink exactly as you like it.  I enjoy their girly martini list, too.  As far as happy hour food goes, I do not recommend ordering off of the happy hour food menu; it isn't very good and the management is definitely taking shortcuts here, which is unfortunate because it leaves a bad mark on their name.  If you stick with the non-discounted menu though, expect quality food."}
{"text":"Was in town and wanted to try something besides Strongsville and ended up here.  I thought it would be some old school, barn like establishment on the side of a creek but it's actually in a small shopping center.    Very quaint spot with a mature vibe.  The menu was pretty big with traditional American options like sandwiches and steaks.  The drink menu was pretty varied too with a focus on martinis.  Server was very nice and the food came out quick.  View of the creek is a nice touch as well, would definitely come back if in the area."}
{"text":"Eddie's Creekside is a great restaurant for a nice dinner. It is located along Chippewa Creek in Brecksville, with great views over the creek. There is an outdoor patio for when the weather is nice overlooking the creek, which is beautiful. Aside from the scenery, the food is excellent. I ate a Shrimp Piccata dinner, which was on the dinner specials for that night. It was very good, consisting of shrimp atop tomato angel hair pasta. It also came with a delicious side salad with Italian dressing I chose. For dessert, I had a honey nut cheesecake, which was excellent. It was topped with baklava. I highly recommend this place for dinner."}
{"text":"Pot roast sandwich and shrimp Alfredo were delicious. Pizza was good but the crust was undercooked.  Our server Chelsea was very inattentive.  First time there and disappointed."}
{"text":"just returned from Creekside - Valentine's Day dinner - my steak was ordered rare and came well done - after speaking to the server who did nothing and a manager whose response was a $5 comeback card - took the dinner home so I could finish twice baked potato and veggie - very disappointed in their response - expected better from a restaurant that we have enjoyed in the past- only reason it got 2 stars because my husband enjoyed his dinner - but their response was totally not what I would expect.  Afraid they have lost a customer - will be a long time if ever that I return - even with the $5 gift card.  Just received a phone call from restaurant - stepping up and doing the right thing - This is what I expected from them and I am pleased with their response -"}
{"text":"The service is very slow place was not that busy got here at 5:30 it's 7:30 now took to long to get food and the Easter menu was not that great for 17.95 for pork that was cold potato too they need more help for the holidays"}
{"text":"A sunny summer Sunday afternoon on the back deck overlooking the creek at Creekside is difficult to beat. My date and I had their South of the Border pizza, a unique combination. The large pizza can easily feed 4 people, be prepared for leftovers. I had a Long Island Iced Tea, well concocted. I wish there was a more extensive list of bar offerings. The wine choices were meager. I've dined at most of the Brecksville restaurants and consider Creekside the best overall experience."}
{"text":"they have really good food, one of the nicer restaurants in the brecksville/sagamore hills area, nice views, awesome patio & great happy hour specials.  the only complaint i usually have is their service is not the best."}
{"text":"All atmosphere; food is not worth it. We had an indoor creek side table which was quaint. The rest of the indoor tables would be no different than any other restaurant. The service was friendly. Three meals and the only flavor to any of them was the Caesar side salads and sangria. $60 for two adults and 1 child was not worth it. Even the bread was bland. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We just had a baby shower in the private room at Creekside. This is a great location and the room has a lot of natural light as well as a beautiful view. We served eggplant Parmesan and chicken picatta. Both were delicious!  The staff couldn't have been more helpful. Our server was Mindy and she was fabulous!  Friendly, professional, and made everything happen flawlessly. Thank you Creekside for making our event such a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This is an absolute gorgeous little gem of a restaurant. You don't need to be outside to enjoy the spectacular scenic view of a Brecksville creek (hence the name.) They have plenty of windows that can fill the whole restaurant with natural light. It's upscale and classy and not too dressy that you feel out of place when you don't wear a suit. There's a party room perfect for gatherings.  There's also a full bar that could be a separate business. It has tables and chairs and a couple TVs that makes it perfect for watching sports. The happy hour has great specials.  They not only do catering, they have a bakery in the front. It has a wide variety of cakes, cookies, rolls, and breads."}
{"text":"A good friendly atmosphere. Food is good quality-- not exactly cheap, but not expensive. Nice view overlooking the creek, especially in the spring and fall."}
{"text":"Have been here several times.  I love coming in the winter and sitting by the huge windows overlooking the ravine.  It's the next best thing when all the patios are closed.  I appreciate the variety on their menu, and have always had decent food when I come here.  I sat on the patio for the first time this past weekend, and it is really nice.  You sit on a balcony with spotlights on the nature below, which is fun for wildlife viewing.  One thing that's a bit odd:  I've been here at almost any given time (weeknight dinner, weekend lunch, happy hours, weekend dinners, after dinner drinks and dessert), and I always feel like I've come at an off time.  The place is always less than half full, and yet I feel like there are a lot of workers and they're all really busy, as if they're preparing for another rush."}
{"text":"I had a great meal at the Creekside Restaurant tonight.  It was Sunday night and they were having their 8 oz. sirloin steak special which was very reasonably priced.  Food and service was great and the place was packed.  I wasn't familiar with the area and the was a great spur of the moment Yelp find."}
{"text":"The store front is deceiving, this was my first time at creekside. It was very nice inside and I enjoyed sitting out on the patio. Our waitress was very friendly. I had the bourbon maple pork chops with broccoli and sweet potato fries. The broccoli and sweet potato fries were perfect, unfortunately the pork chops were not the best I've ever had. They were full of fat and under cooked for my taste. I did take them home and reheat them the next day, but I probably wouldn't order them again. But I would probably give the restaurant another try in the future."}
{"text":"Truly disappointed. From the 45 minute wait time( was told it would be 20), to the 40 minute time it took for the waitress to take our order. I have heard many good things from this place, but cannot agree at all. Maybe better luck next time, if there is one."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Had the crusted salmon with a salad. Balsamic dressing was great and one of the best in have had. Salmon over done a little but I did ask for it more on the well side so can't complain to much. The only thing I would improve was the service. The waitress who served us in the bar area was a little...prickly! Not super friendly and felt like we were an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Party of six ate there the other night and had a decent meal.  We liked the beer and cocktail list to get us started and then dove into our food order:  Lobster Bisque (we all got to taste and gave it an okay, but not great rating), Walleye (server suggested breadcrumb topping which turned out to be coated and deep fried), 1/2 slab of Kansas City BBQ ribs that were tender with good sauce, lobster quesadilla (loaded high and tasty) and the trio shrimp platter (it was okay;t pilaf was a bit too sticky).  Kids had mac n cheese.  Kudos for having some healthier sides for the smaller eaters (if memory serves me correctly, one had applesauce and the other had carrots with dip).  Our server was nice to deal with.  Please note that 3 stars is an A-OK rating which is was.  Likely to try other restaurants before coming back here.  Would recommend it to others, though."}
{"text":"The no wait function on Yelp and the No Wait App both do not work for this establishment. Arrived to have a nice breakfast to see there were many people waiting inside and we were told the wait would be an hour and a half for 6 people while the app was reporting 0min wait. Waste of time, wish I could have tried the food."}
{"text":"We use Eddie's a lot for work catering (in the morning). They are on time and helpful. People really like their scones. Actually, people love their scones.   We also hold our Christmas party here yearly for work. They have a small party room (under 40 people). It is sort of a difficult shape to move through when people are out of their seats, but we always have a great time and we have never had any food/service issues. They are also accomodating with my food allergy and always are willing to make me something special.   The views are amazing here and I really, really want to visit in the summer and sit on their patio."}
{"text":"It's not great. It's not horrible. Service can be sort of slow at times but always friendly. The food is nothing special. But the prices are still somewhat high compared to the taste and quality of preparation.   The onion rings are great!"}
{"text":"Walked in as any other place got seated right away, waiter came and took the order order appetizers which was good but the thing that I did not like was how long it took for are waiter to return to pick up the check for us to pay 30 to 40 minutes just for us to Pay I highly recommend getting in before the busy times and ask to be seated on the patio area outside next to the rail.     The food was ok not the greatest."}
{"text":"Had wonderful Mother's Day dinner here.  Lemon chicken was delicious and large portion.  Everyone had nice meals.  Staff friendly and efficient on a very busy evening.  Nice views."}
{"text":"Decent place. The view is alright but not as cool as other reviewers make it sound; it's a little creek. The food was pretty good and while I didn't partake, the deserts looked great."}
{"text":"Lobster quesadilla was a great app! Went with some friends; we are looking for a new venue to meet up. Hope to come back and work my way across the menu a bit more!"}
{"text":"This poor chef has to make me a Citrus Tuna Wrap all of the time!  This sandwich is huge on a soft ciabatta pita with delicious (house-made?) pickles.  I just adore it.  I'm a fan of a tuna melt and this is kind of like a lighter alternative.  I like to get it with their specialty house salad which is delish with Gorgonzola, pecans, craisins, etc.   I like it best with the fat free raspberry vinaigrette.     I've also had their burger special and whether I go with my husband or coworker, I've never heard a complaint about anything else.  The deck overlooks the creek, but the interior tables also have some nice creek views as well.  It's more exciting the day after a heavy rain but you will see and hear some gorgeous birds too.    I have had REALLY fabulous servers here.  They do have take-out, but know that if you order a drink you'll get a little bitty cup.  Oh and they also have glorious looking desserts to greet you on your way in.      This would be a good place to take your parents and show off the natural beauty of the valley."}
{"text":"I'd been to Creekside many years ago but didn't remember a lot about it. Danielle gave me a choice between this and another restaurant for dinner on Friday and I chose this based on the menu.   I got the Walleye dinner and thought it tasted good but wasn't great. it seemed like everything was fried in grease that wasn't hot enough. my fish was very greasy and my fries were cooked but kinda tough. the coleslaw was good, though. i also had a \"spicy\" broccoli cheese soup that was good but wasn't spicy. i added lots of black pepper.   i did appreciate that they served their fish with tartar sauce and not some pretentious remoulade. that crap irritates me.    One thing i really liked is that it's a really pretty place. we sat outside and the view was beautiful. inside the restaurant looked pretty too.   we'll check it out again at some point, i'm sure. it was good enough for another shot."}
{"text":"There are some unique options on the menu that looked appealing, but I think they missed the mark on delivery.  While we waited for some friends, my wife had a wine flight (we have never seen a wine flight before) and I ordered a beer flight. The wine flight was a decent deal in that we received three full glasses of wine. Although my wife didn't care for them at the start, she was ready for a second flight after the alcohol kicked in. The beer flight was six samples from area breweries that I enjoyed. For the price, both flights seemed to be a decent deal.  While we had our flights, we also ordered the lobster quesadilla. This would have been okay, but I think it was an instance of trying to over-please by putting too many ingredients in between the tortilla. The result was a pretty soggy and rich tasting appetizer that could have been a meal on its own. At the end of the night we only ate half of this and didn't bother taking the rest home as it really wasn't very good.  For dinner my wife got the steak dinner which she mentioned was okay, but a little over-priced for the quality. There didn't seem to be anything overly special except that she got goat cheese with the baked potato. I got the walleye melt which was simply just a walleye sandwich with cheddar cheese melted on top. The sandwich was okay, though the walleye was a bit oily from the fryer. This came with french fries which were fairly standard. The fries were nothing special, but they also were not bad and I certainly finished those off.  At the end of the night, we both had some pretty bad upset stomachs. Some of this was likely the food choices, but I suspect most of it could be traced back to the appetizer. Overall the service was fine and were attentive but not overbearing. All that said, I am sure we will not return. For locals this may not be a bad place to visit; however if I were driving through the area I would wait until the next stop. Most of our decision on this is the wrenching feeling in our guts over the last 24 hours."}
{"text":"Had a very tasty pasta dish with artichokes and garlic and mushrooms.  It was super garlic-y, which is a plus for me, but might be a bit off putting for others.  The tempura shrimp appetizer was awesome!"}
{"text":"Another great dinner at Creekside, following a matinee at Western Reserve Playhouse. We were able to get potato skin appetizer with bacon on the side since my wife opted out of most meat. Entrees were ravioli and carne asada salad. Excellent food, attentive service, and a great view overlooking the fall colors along the creek."}
{"text":"Great evening at this local spot. Server was kind and attentive. I ordered the srircha   turkey burger with a side cup of vegetable soup. It was good, not great. Relaxed atmosphere overall."}
{"text":"After working up an appetite paddle boarding and kayaking, a friend and I stopped into Creekside around 4 pm on a Saturday. We decided to share 2 appetizers: the Honey Sesame Tempura Shrimp and the Beef Satay. She also had a cup of soup and I had a side salad.  Holy yum! I have to admit I was skeptical whether the tempura shrimp would actually be a true tempura style. To my surprise and delight it was and it was delicious! The shrimp were huge and very tasty.  Because my friend has a peanut sensitivity, we ordered the sauce on the side. The beef was so flavorful (the aroma was divine!) that I ended up forgoing the sauce. I will definitely be ordering these apps again! My friend loved the potato soup and I enjoyed my salad with Pecan Vinaigrette, which I usually get when ordering from or dining at Creekside. Our server was great and didn't miss a beat, even as other tables began to fill up. The perfect ending to a great summer day."}
{"text":"After not having been here for years, I really enjoyed my recent trip. The food was very good, service was great, and the place has a nice atmosphere. Honestly, it isn't anything I would go out of my way for, but if you're in the area, it's a nice little spot."}
{"text":"Worst food and service in town. My meal was horrible. Not edible. I couldn't eat it and probably shouldn't have paid for it. I did not leave the waitress a tip. I'm sure she knew the food she served me was horrible which is probably why she never came back to the table. We had to hunt her down (she was hiding out in the kitchen) to get our check so we could get out of the place (before I got sick, I was totally grossed out). This was my third time eating at this place. Every time has been awful. I'm done giving it a chance. I've lived in town for nearly 14 yrs, if it hasn't improved by now it NEVER will. The only thing this place has going for it is the view of the creek. You're better off getting take out at Heinen's and sitting at a picnic table at the Metro Park around the corner. Don't waste your time or money at Eddy's Creekside."}
{"text":"Eddie's Creekside vs. Courtyard- an ongoing debate  Pros of Eddies: 1) Great happy hour- especially if you come on a day when they have pizza for $1.99 2) Great Pizza- hand tossed, airy crust, good sauce- all you need (in my opinion better than all the other local places we have tried) 3) Their salad is delicious and you can get a smaller portion if desired 4)  They have coconut shrimp 5)  They have a semi-decent brunch 6)  They carry Pama (my favorite drink is 2parts silver Patron, 1 part Pama, splash of lemon/lime soda) 7)  Nice outdoor seating- beautiful view  Cons: 1) Lacking beer options 2) More formal/serious (not exactly sure of the correct word) compared to courtyard- menu and decor reflect this as well, however not price  Eddies or Courtyard- not sure myself- both a little different from one another and both get 4 stars :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch!  I visited with 5 others and everyone enjoyed their meal. That does not happen too often.  At the table we had chicken and waffles (2), Pumpkin pancakes, the traditional, the omelette of the day, and peanut butter banana waffle.  We have already made plans to go back next month.    I have also visited one time before in the back party room for a bridal shower.  The food was ok for that but the view on the creek was amazing and added a little extra something."}
{"text":"One time I had something I didn't like. The food could be a tiny bit better but the scenery is great!"}
{"text":"I've gone here on occasion for around 15 years. Always a consistently good meal at a good value. Had their lemon zest pancakes and a side of bacon several weeks ago and it was incredible! The Bellini and Bloody Mary were both awesome and not expensive."}
{"text":"I don't know why it has taken me so long to go here... I remember going years ago when it was still Eddie's Creekside, but for some reason or another, it has taken me this long to return.  I have to say that I won't let that happen again!  My boyfriend and I went around 8 pm for my birthday yesterday (I tend to celebrate for the entire week of my b-day and not just the actual day).  We were seated right away (the restaurant was kind of empty) at a booth next to the window overlooking the winter wonderland that was the creek.  It was beautiful.  We started with boneless wings which started out sweet and then had a hint of heat at the end.  I ordered the Tex Mex grinder for my meal which was incredibly flavorful... the peppers and chorizo added a kick and the chicken was moist.  The cilantro sour cream topped everything off perfectly and I liked it so much that I stole a few of Bill's fries to dip into it.  He ordered the pot roast which came heaped onto a potato pancake... he seemed to really enjoy it as there was none to be seen at the end of the meal.  One thing I saw on the specials menu is that Tuesdays are \"Stop Whining Tuesdays\" which means their bottles of wine are served at supplier's pricing ($11 for the whole bottle at a restaurant?!? That's unheard of!)... I wish Bill liked wine because I definitely would have taken advantage of that.  An entire bottle at dinner is a little much for one person ;)"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the quality of food because we have not made it past the entrance.... Despite our best attempts. A couple weeks ago, we stopped by on a busy Sunday morning and obviously had a wait ahead of us. In the lobby of the restaurant, my daughter tripped and began screaming bloody murder. No one came to see if they could help. Instead, the employees gave us cold stares and ignored us when we tried to get a damp towel for my daughters tears. Then today, my son and I arrived at 8:05am and were greeted with a locked door and several employees in the other side who expertly ignored us as we tried to open the door and then get their attention.   Again, I can't speak to the food or quality of service once you are seated but we will most certainly never be back!"}
{"text":"My husband enjoyed the pork chops and gravy but I felt the honey pecan chicken was lacking in flavor for a signature dish. This place has potential but the service could be better and the food could use some finishing touches."}
{"text":"A nice place to sit back, relax and enjoy great service and good food.  The last time I was there for dinner, I ordered Honey Peacan Chicken with Roasted Garlic Redskin Mashed Potatoes (which comes with a side salad and warm roll). Tasty!!  And, enough to take home for another meal."}
{"text":"Food is way overpriced for the quality. my salad said mixed greens and was $11 it was nothing but iceberg lettuce. threw the rest away what a waste of $ and the chicken that came with it was chewy and not good. our apps were ok the quesadilla was good as well as the potato skins. I had a the chicken Ciabatta sandwich it was just not that great and lacked flavor. the chicken texture was not tender but hard and chewy. I also had the country pork chop. it was just ok and again the meat texture was not tender enough. the gravy was ok. the atmosphere was good but we were disappointed with the food. will not be returning or recommending sorry. service was not bad."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast, and it was good! The staff is all very friendly, and it really is a local favorite. We decided to sit outside on the deck, and the view is lovely! The bf and I split the cinnamon French toast and a fruit cup, and we each got to try the waffle and the pancakes as well. First off, the portions are sizable, especially for those prices!! The French toast was hearty and tasty with the perfect amount of cinnamon filling. The fruit cup was a little underwhelming though- I think the melons were just not ripe. The waffle I tried was crisp and light, and the pancake was nice and fluffy! Only thing hat I'd ding this place on is the syrup- it doesn't seem like real syrup. The flavor is just a little off, and it made everything a lot stickier than real syrup does. Overall, good food and atmosphere, I'll probably be back, but I'm tempted to just bring my own syrup lol."}
{"text":"Food was decent, especially for the price. I enjoyed my burger, and the Cleveland Whiskey cocktails were a pleasant surprise. But I second the comments made about the rude hostess. I made a reservation online and received a confirmation that it was accepted at the time I had requested. However, my friends arrived first and were told they had no reservation and that we would be put on the list. As it was a Friday night, there were several people waiting for a table. When I arrived my friends said they didn't have the reservation. So I went to the hostess and said I had a reservation. She asked if I was with the two women who had already checked in, I said yes, and she replied \"you don't have a reservation.\" I tried to show her the confirmation but she wouldn't look at it and kept saying you're not on the reservation list. It was an unpleasant experience, not sure that I will return."}
{"text":"Had date night here with my hubby, what a beautiful place!  We sat on the deck and thoroughly enjoyed the view, as well as the reasonably priced, delicious food. The service wasn't the fastest, but they were busy and we didn't mind.  Definitely headed back soon!"}
{"text":"Come for the patio, stay for the food.  This place is kind of a hidden gem with a beautiful patio in back overlooking the woods/creek.  The inside dining room isn't as special but they do have a number of tables overlooking the creek.  I tried the Caribbean Omelet, which has chicken, portabella mushrooms, onions, jerk spices, and pepper jack cheese.  Those ingredients were a good combo and the omelet had a lot of flavor (spicy!) but I noticed the chicken was little dry/rubbery.  The Cinnamon Style French Toast made from cinnamon swirl bread was delicious.  The orange juice wasn't fresh-squeezed, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The service was a little slow/scattered - it looked like there was just one person working the whole patio.  But on a beautiful day you certainly won't mind waiting a few extra minutes enjoying the gorgeous scenery."}
{"text":"I went here with my co-workers as an end of the year celebration dinner. The place was located in the plaza right by Starbucks and had the view by a creek side, hence it's name.  There were seven of us and from the looks of the place, they were packed but the service was exceptionally good. Our server was very attentive and answered all of our questions and also offered some suggestions. At the time I went I didn't have a big appetite so I only ordered a salad. I am fan of a really good salad which means it has a mix of spinach, arugula, and other greens however, I was disappointed. Their salads was just your cheap water lettuce with some romaine lettuce on top.   I left hungry and wished I had ordered something different. I'd give this place another try when I'm back around the area.   As far as the ambiance, felt very cozy and homey. So it's a go-to place for locals and families."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the main entrees were really good. The scallop spinach salad did not lack scallops and was really good. The crab bisque in the other hand didn't have any crab meat in it, we had two at the table and neither had meat. The waitress was arguing with who appeared to be the manager or lead waitress during our visit which affected the way we were treated. Our salads were tossed down in front of us in a bad manner. She progressively got better, but no excuse to treat the patrons this way."}
{"text":"Nice place, foods good not great very simple but enjoyable and the dessert is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Stopped  in the bar for a drink with friends. Pretty quiet on a Friday night.  Service was good.  I had a off menu chocolate martini."}
{"text":"Ive been here a couple times with different people, during different meal times, and ordered different things. Its generally a cool place to go to if you're in the area but its not one to travel too far for (UNLESS YOU LIKE LEMON RICOTTA PANCAKES) those things are banging here!   It is located in a building that shares other stores - but you don't feel that way once you're inside. If you can call ahead or wait for a table on the patio overlooking the river or a window seat your experience will be even better. Its really pretty.   Cant speak on the drinks - however the food has been really good every time. As mentioned above - lemon ricotta pancakes are to die for. Yesterday I enjoyed the Scarlet salad and added strawberries instead of cranraisins (i love fresh fruit in a salad). It was a generous size and I felt like it was totally worth the money. I order salads with chicken a lot and you can tell this wasn't like microwave rubber chicken (Thats important!). Fresh ingredients, nice homemade dressings. Bf got the bbq chicken wrap - it wasn't anything to write home to mom about, but not bad either.   Service was great - our waitress was SO patient with this group of old ladies who were MORE than needy - i even complimented her on it. She was attentive and accommodating without making you feel annoying- one of those \"no problem, be right back!\" kinda girls. It was great! I'll be back when in the area, nice place to stop after the Brecksville reservation."}
{"text":"The holiday inn recommended this place. The restaurant is really nice but the food kinda sucks. I got the buffalo shrimp appetizer and my waitress said it was taking longer than usual because it was one shrimp short. Well it came out the exact same time as my main course. And one shrimp was super hot and the rest were room temp. I got the rib eye medium and it came out super rare. My bill was in the 40's and I didn't feel like I ate a 40$ meal. I won't go back. Up to you"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a late lunch. We hadn't been here since it was Eddies Creekside. We will be back though. I had the Tex Mex Grinder and she had the Cajun Burger. Both were awesome. I was not expecting what I got there at all.   The Tex Mex is a full chicken breast, chorizo, roasted red peppers and scallions. It's huge and has tons of flavor. Try it! You're welcome."}
{"text":"Great place to sit in the bar and grab a bottle of wine.  I have never eaten in the dining room... but hear the view is nice.      Service is always good.  Food is \"okay\"."}
{"text":"Caution! Had lunch there Friday and got very ill-all the signs of food poisoning, abdominal cramping, gas, diarrhea. Had the tuna salad flatbread"}
{"text":"A great place to go for a simple but delicious dinner.  I like to eat in the bar.  Tom makes a nice drink and the staff is friendly and welcoming.  Give the martini sampler a try and if you can make it for happy hour, they have great appetizer specials.    Overall, the best value in Brecksville.  And don't forget to pick up a loaf of their Cinnamon bread to take home!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Good food. Big and somewhat formal/upscale feel on the inside. More casual outdoor patio. Somewhat high prices. Logistical issues galore!  We sat outside. There is a row of tables that overlooks the creek and a few tables that are outside, but next to the building so you can't really see the creek. I'm not sure why we ended up there when there were more creekside tables available?  The food was very good, prices seemed a little high. I had some lobster enchiladas and a lovely salad with pecan dressing. Unfortunately the server brought warm bread, then salads, then the entrees all within about 6 minutes. It felt really rushed. I guess I could have eaten my entree while it was warm, and then salad afterward, but then why not bring the food out in that order?   Anyway, it was delicious! Homemade salad dressing! Lovely delicate flavor to the rice! The bread was really good, although I was afraid to eat the last piece. How many paper napkins and straw wrappers end up in the creek?  I would definitely go back. As we were leaving we noticed there are more tables inside that also overlook the creek so it's not just a summer time view. The food was pretty inventive (a neighboring table got a blood orange cocktail that just looked divine) and there are some interesting items on the menu I'd love to try. I just wish they could get their logisitics together!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of visiting this gem again during a recent visit home. Had a lovely lunch with my grandparents, father and brother before heading back to Florida. Instead of having my usual pecan crusted chicken, I opted for the turkey panini which was great! As always, we had a flawless experience and the service was great. Until next time... Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and I like this place. I usually come in right after work and before a workout so I sit at the bar and casually enjoy something to eat. Staff has been friendly and competent even if I have a time restraint. Sometimes the bar area is relaxed and sometimes it's pretty loud and busy. Happy hour is from 3-6pm with drink and food specials.   Scarlet Salad $10.95 Blackened Shrimp Salad $12.95 HH Zucchini Planks $3 HH Potato Skins $4  For the food, the salads are awesome! Hearty portions, full of flavor, and decently priced. They also let you make substitutions like cucumbers instead of tomatoes or you can add different proteins. HH options have been hit or miss so far. The zucchini planks were too fried tasting for me if that makes sense? I didn't like the coating. The potato skins are your standard cheesy, bacony, bad for you bar food that hits the spot with only slight regret for over indulging.   Oh and they have hooks under the bar for your purse! Love that!   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Although we are frequent diners here and generally enjoy the food and atmosphere, the front of the house is a disaster...and getting worse. The hostess not only doesn't greet guests as valued customers, she seems annoyed that she has to deal with them. It's obvious that she doesn't enjoy her job or dealing with the public in general-a strange hire for the hostess job. What she lacks in personality and graciousness more than compensated for by the waitstaff who are friendly and efficient. The food here is pretty good most of the time, but somewhat inconsistent. Some of the sauces taste like they came right out of the restaurant supply sauce-bag and the fried fish breading is always soggy due to the oil not being hot enough. But it's still one of the best restaurants in the Brecksville area. The hostess issue really needs to be addressed before I give them a fourth star."}
{"text":"While i've always been a fan of this spot, I doubt I will return. I went to a rehearsal party here recently with 30 people where they had an appetizer buffet. We were in the back room which is nice, but probably not ideal for a buffet, because it is so narrow it makes it difficult to maneuver to the food. The staff seemed scattered and took a long time getting drinks. My water was only refilled twice in 2 and a half hours which was disappointing. The appetizers were ok, shrimp, meat and cheeses, although the pizza was cold and two people at my table bit into very raw chicken fingers.  I don't know how they could put an entire tray of raw chicken fingers out? Needless to say we left still hungry."}
{"text":"Three of us came for lunch yesterday and it was just lovely. Sitting outside listening to the creek was so serene and relaxing. The waitress was on top of things and very nice. We each ordered a different menu item and we were all happy. I had the avocado blt  with lemon pesto mayo. With homemade potato chips. Crazy good!  Someone else had the shrimp and they loved it and the other dish was the Louisiana salad. Also divine. We can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I like going here because of the atmosphere and the food is good.  But this is the second time this year where the hostess has basically almost ruined the experience for me.  Instead of being hospitable and polite as a hostess should, she was unwelcoming and seemed irritated by our presence upon our arrival to the restaurant. I have a young daughter (15 months) who I needed to take for a walk to distract her when she became irritable in the restaurant and instead of being discretionary and politely asking for us to leave the bar area instead she publicly embarrassed me and scolded me for having her in that area and \"kicked us out\". There is a better way to handle yourself when dealing with customers. Creekside should try to find someone who can understand the importance of customer service and fix the rude hostess issue. What a turnoff. (The support hostesses seating guests were perfectly pleasant, the \"greeter\" is miserable)"}
{"text":"Dinner was really good  Kinda pricey  My husband had honey pecan chicken - it came with mash potatoes and a salad. He also ordered a lobster quesadilla appetizer.   I had a burger. It was done the way I asked and it was decent. The fries were under cooked.   Our server was good. They were sold out of pie!!"}
{"text":"My wife had the turkey dinner soup...or something like that. She LOVED it , gravey broth ,vegtables, a stuffing ball and cranberries. My chicken dish...mulberry somoetjing...sorry.was tasty and so filling .the staff was great."}
{"text":"Creekside is a great local restaurant. My first visit was for a bday party. Creekside is a lot larger than it appears. It has a full bar and ample seating. When we walked in at 5 were were seated right away and greeted by our waitress. The are a lot of menu options to please everyone in your party. I chose the seafood pasta, which was to die for. Great experience and can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Confession: I've lived most of my life about two miles from this place and my first time here was on Sunday. Oops! But it was well worth the wait. I came with two friends for lunch and I was trying to find a place that would show them how beautiful Brecksville is, so I settled on Creekside. There was no wait for seating on the patio, so we were able to overlook the Chippewa Creek as we ate, which was lovely. It was a bit chilly, especially when the breeze was blowing, but I was so glad we were able to be outside.   The coffee was pretty meh, but they kept my mug full, so it's an acceptable trade-off. I had the Tuscan Pie and I highly recommend it, particularly for a lunch. If you get the medium, you can probably split it between two people, to be honest. I was a bit nervous about the balsamic glaze--some people can really kill a pizza using it--but this was spot on. Not to overpowering, but tangy enough to cut the richness of the artichokes and cheese.  If I went back for brunch/breakfast, I'd probably try the B.L.E.C.T. (or maybe it's BELCT?). Egg, bacon, arugula, cheese, and a few other delicious toppings on ciabatta bread. One of my friends had it and she cleaned her plate!  I think the Courtyard might still be one of my favorite (far-too-long under-appreciated by me) Brecksville restaurants, but this is definitely a lovely place for brunch."}
{"text":"This place was fine. We went with the extended family, including three kids. Everyone found something on the menu to order but not everything was done as well as i expected. No standouts to recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  The service was a little slow, granted it was dinner time and a little crowded.  I ordered the Scarlet Salad, and everyone else at my table tried different salads.  We all loved them!  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Creekside's bar has the best happy hour in town and the food and drinks are excellent! Cindy, Debbie and Izzy are the nicest and most talented bartenders with great personalities. Among all the restaurants in the area, Creekside is #1."}
{"text":"We had lunch here with friends today. I would recommend looking at the menu online before you go because they have so many good choices available you'll want to have an idea of what you want before you get there. They have daily specials & Tuesday was $6.00 Burger day & Thursday was Buy one Pizza & get one free day. The Lobster Bisque Soup was good & I had the Tex Mex Grinder which was a great sandwich. The service was good & we ate outside in August but they had fans on the porch so it was not uncomfortable & the view was great. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a quality lunch in Brecksville."}
{"text":"Food is good, drinks on the expensive side, service is good on restaurant side .... the bar side is another story. They have a special \"happy hour\" special - gourmet burger and craft beer until 4 Pm on Saturdays for $10. Today I even called up to confirm the special. Was put on hold because apparently the hostess did not know.  A few minutes later she confirmed the special ... oh and the hours? I get put on hold again and five minutes later she picks up and asks if she can help me. Apparently forgot I was on hold. OK ... special is until 4 PM on Saturdays she says. So I've been looking forwards to this the whole month. Show up at 3:33 PM and female bartender bluntly tells us that the happy hour special is only during the week. I tell her that her statement is not correct and that the burger special is until 4 PM ... SHE now has to check. By now my blood pressure has hit the ceiling and my stomach is upset so we just leave. Not the first first time the service there was not up par. We are friends with Great Lakes Brewing and had to sit there one Saturday while the bartender berated Great Lakes Brewing and what ripoff they are and why Eddie's will not carry them. No more ... they've lost our business."}
{"text":"i have been there 3 times now and will be back!  i haven't had a bad thing yet.  go for the daily specials during the week.  the food and service are great.  i enjoy the outdoor patio, it has a great view. it's the perfect date place."}
{"text":"D I's review says it all for me:  It's not great. It's not horrible. Service can be sort of slow at times but always friendly. The food is nothing special. But the prices are still somewhat high compared to the taste and quality of preparation.    I will add that it is in a mall shopping center, which is deceiving but the interior is quite nice and a pleasant surprise. I would never travel to come here but when in the area for work, it's a solid 3 star lunch option."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place.  Decided to order Buffalo Chicken salad which it came from specials.   I really liked it very much.  They even put the ranch dressing on the side.  And they had a great lemonade!!!!   I will def come back again!"}
{"text":"My workplace has used Eddie's Creekside, now just known as Creekside, for private catered parties for Christmas.  It's nice, nothing too extraordinary though.  My preferred experience with Creekside, however, is ordering out their Pizza Margherita all to myself and devouring it at home with a glass of wine and a good movie.  I'd like to try their other pizzas (Lobster Pesto pizza sounds amazing), but it's temping to just get their Pizza Margherita over and over instead - it is perfection!"}
{"text":"Creek side is a very nice place with really good food.  You'll find us at happy hour every Friday.   The good;  Great happy hour appetizers ($1.99 for some creative and tasty plates) Good food!  Traditional American with some interesting twists Really fun and attentive wait staff Great patio Nice location Good wine list  The not-so-good:  The beer list is really poor. Typically, they have a really poor draft selection and a really limited bottled selection  The tap system seems off. Draft beers typically have an odd taste"}
{"text":"The Caribbean/Jamaican omelet is the only good thing on the menu. Everything else taste very salty or bland. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"A ++ shrimp lobster pasta,  everything was great good service ! !"}
{"text":"Writing this review is a hard one. Nothing stood out, for better or worse about the place.   Could I find a restaurant to fit the preferences of some very particular family members: Located outside of downtown or Tremont, No Asian, Mexican, Middle Eastern cuisines, a relatively conservative menu [for example no shallots, truffle oil], no an upscale gastropub atmosphere [like Great Lakes][The Creekside does have a bar although it's well-separated from the restaurant], a step above applebee's and tgif fridays. and a meal (for entrée, salad, plus one or 2 apps and desserts for the table, including tax/tip, no alcohol) all for $25-35 a person ?!   On those all of those fronts, Eddie's Creekside fits the bill well.   However, my experience was relatively ok. The service was also all right although it had been several minutes after being seated that our server appeared. For their Tuesday special, they had some bottles of wine under $10. I don't know much about wine, but at least none of them were Matthew Fox or Charles Shaw.  The menu: it's American, with a few options with pasta, steak, fish, sandwiches, and wraps categories. For me, the Scarlet Salad was ok, came out as described except for the chicken breast was slightly undercooked [no grill marks on any of the pieces] and on the plus side, it had mixed greens [iceberg, romaine, spinach]. The pizza ? A lot more mozzarella cheese than I expected. However, whole sliced tomatoes were on it.   Another in my party had a steak and it appeared to come out of a box: thin and perfectly cut like it was from a factory press.   All in all, an average meal. The rest of my party members: for what's it's worth, a couple of them hated the food and thought it was overpriced [though they're extremely picky and one of them thinks any wine that has a strong smell means it bad].   On the plus side, they gave out a free cupcake for one of my party member's birthdays.   It's hard for a final rating. I'd rather give them 2.5 stars (It was 'OK' and 'I've had better' experiences). I usually don't venture out to Brecksville so I can't recommend any options nearby."}
{"text":"Excellent place!!  Found on Trip Advisor and took a chance. Food is awesome.  Must have the potato pancakes as a side.  We had Jack as our waiter and he was so friendly and helpful with recommendations for what to order.  We are from Chicago and it was a nice vacation dinner!"}
{"text":"Pretty traditional family restaurant, but a reliable standby that supports the community. Best part about my most recent visit was the delicious, SURPRISE cupcake for my birthday. We didn't even stick around for dessert, so they bagged up the cupcake and sent it home for later. Very thoughtful.  They have excellent outdoor seating along Chippewa Creek. Hopefully the building won't fall into the water anytime soon!"}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked away with a scenic view of the creek in Brecksville.  And the food isn't too bad either!    I recently visited here with a friend after a morning of hiking in the nearby Cuyahoga Valley.  We were ravenous and she knew that Creekside was nearby, so I agreed to give it a try.    Weekend brunches include the option of breakfast food (main dining room) or lunch food (bar area).  We chose to go for lunch and were promptly greeted by a friendly and competent server.  It didn't take us long to decide on a pizza to split (medium, and it was more than enough for us both), and our order was promptly taken to the kitchen.    About 10 minutes later, the Pizza Rustica we ordered came out on a spiral-shaped pizza stand.  It was cooked until the crust was a golden brown perfection and the cheese bubbled in crispy fingers at the edges.  The fresh tomato slices on the top had just begin to curl up at the edges of their skins and the pepperoni punctuated each slice (8 slices on a medium).  One bite and the yummy flavor of Italian sausage and fresh basil tickled my tastebuds.  This is hands-down one of the best oven fresh pizzas I have ever had, and I would consider myself something of a pizza connoisseur.    If you go, please consider the Pizza Rustica. It should be on any pizza connoisseur's list of top pizzas anywhere, which I hope you'll agree with!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of draft ales. Pleasant and helpful staff. Broad menu - something for everybody. Food was wholesome and flavorful. I had the whiskey salmon which I enjoyed. My buddy liked his beer-battered walleye. Overall, a nice experience and excellent value for the price."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely terrible. The host was rude, the server was extremely unfriendly and the food was well below average. The best part of our experience was the food runner. I will never ever come back nor recommend this place to anybody. I wouldn't feed this food to my dog."}
{"text":"This place always amazes!  Private luncheons, Sunday breakfast, dinner with family, drinks at the bar with friends.  The owners are obviously obsessed with the details because from the service staff to the food they are consistently the best in the area.  This is my favorite place to eat by far!"}
{"text":"Creekside is a good place but like any, you have to navigate the menu carefully. If it is breakfast time you can't go wrong. Stop by after church, sit out on the big deck overlooking Chippewa Creek and get anything from pancakes to fried eggs; you'll be happy.   A big Burger Rustica with fries is more than enough for lunch and the walleye fish fry is always great for dinner. Pizza is excellent as well.  The only time I have heard anyone complain is when they 'tried something different' like some funky chicken breast entree or a special that seems overpriced.  In the end, I am always happy when I leave because I get one of their desserts out of the case to take home. Even the brownies will turn a lousy day into a good one. Peanut Butter Pie, same story. There's a reason this place has been around forever.  It also is comforting to know that the owner got in trouble with an arrogant baseball player's lawyer years ago when he put an 'Albert Belle' burger on the menu and listed the price at $7,000,000."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good - a little pricey for traditional American fare (like Applebee's).  Average salads, soups, burgers.  The best point about my meal there was the pumpkin cassata cake.  Every time I've been here, the service has not been very attentive.  In fact, I feel like I'm in their way or something.  I don't know how they can so many people with a chip on their shoulder.    One time, I ordered a pizza and when I got there to pick it up, they forgot to put the order in.  The person at the front desk proceeded to just apologize but still charged me full price and made me wait 30 mins.  I thought to myself - why should I be punished for their mistake?  When I worked in restaurants, we never charged the customer for our mistakes.  I guess we don't need respect anymore."}
{"text":"The food here is very bland and mediocre. You'll find a better quality and cheaper meal at Panera. The only thing decent about this place was the atmosphere. Nice and somewhat quiet. The bathrooms are utterly disgusting. You'll find a cleaner bathroom at a gas station than here."}
{"text":"Creekside is always a solid bet. It isn't necessarily hip - the clientele is generally made up older folks from the Brecksville area. But the food has always been a winner for me. Their perch is awesome! Every Monday they have a $6 burger special with fries, so you can't beat that. The bar area is nice as well as the patio that overlooks the creek - hence the name!"}
{"text":"I haven't been back since 2013 - when I gave it one star. However, my friend said she wanted to meet me at Creekside for their Happy Hour.  AGAIN, I was not impressed at all. Specifically, the wine seemed a bit watered down and the potato skins were hard and dry (they seemed to be the frozen ones you buy at Gordons Food Service - and were just warmed and thrown on a plate). I don't know when they will get their act together but it hasn't been happening - even with all the new managers. It's an easy thing to serve good appetizers and wine. I do have to say, though, the waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and had eaten here multiple times over the years.  The setting is gorgeous, the food delicious and the wait staff attentive.  The decor is subdued and comfortable.  BEST choices:  lobster bisque, tuna melt and the salad with the scallops and shrimp (cant remember what they call it on the menu).  Oh my gosh - so good!  The pasteries in the cabinet as you walk in always look incredible but I have never tried one because I am too full when I am done with my meal!"}
{"text":"We were traveling here from Michigan. We're looking for a restaurant near our hotel for a quick bite and a couple of cocktails. We were lucky to stumble onto this place.  All the soups, salad dressings, desserts etc. are homemade.  Not only did we have dinner that evening, but we came back for lunch with the rest of our group the next day.  The lemon cilantro dressing for the Greek salad was fantastic. I also loved the soup of the day, creamy vegetable. The pizza was excellent, turkey club top notch, and everyone else enjoyed all of their sandwiches.  I would be a regular if I lived in this area.    I can't leave out the servers. The bartenders and the waitstaff were very accommodating and friendly On both occasions"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour.  There is a wide variety of drinks and the food selection is great as well.  It's reasonably priced and is a great atmosphere.  I would most definitely recommend."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.   Absolutely gorgeous restaurant with a beautiful view of the creek.  Word is that the patio is a beautiful spot on a nice day.  The happy hour looked to have great specials as well.  Our group ordered the lobster bisque (excellent), southwest chicken salad (great), and French mushroom grill (very good, though needed some salt and pepper).  Lots of folks were ordering their Christmas cookies from here.  On top of the view, the best thing here is that it's the kind of menu that leaves you torn between several things that sound great."}
{"text":"The food and service were both very good. We sat outside, which was a very peaceful and serene atmosphere. The serving sizes were huge, but flavor and texture were not compromised. We had the goat cheese crusted salmon with penne and the asiago cheese scallops with fettuccine . Both were very good, served with warm rolls and a garden salad. The salad was a little lacking, but their house made lemon orageno dressing was awesome. All in all, it was a great stick to the bones meal for a reasonable price. I'd definitely go there again."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have made the hike South to Eat at Creekside Restaurant & similar to my previous visit, the food was very good and the atmosphere si very relaxing (dont let the strip mall fool you because they have outdoor sitting that overlooks a small creek & you forget your car parked in a traditional strip mall).    I would suggest any of their seafood or steak because they have been perfectly cook on my two visits.  I am still impressed by food and service from this hidden gem in Brecksville."}
{"text":"Great day for 3 of us for brunch. Wonderful view of the creek.  I had a Greek omelette that was to die for, my husband thoroughly enjoyed his coffee cake French toast.  Our neighbor loved his chicken and waffles.  What an extensive ,impressive menu. We will return many times to try as we surf the menu.   Almost forgot, the food arrived quickly and was hot! What a treat. It's definitely a do again."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and enjoy it. The atmosphere is good and the food better. The wait staff work their feet off and are always ready to help."}
