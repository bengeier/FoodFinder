{"text":"The West Pittsburgh area is very lacking in non-chain restaurants & we were excited to see a farm to table restaurant opening in a robinson strip mall. We walked in & we're not greeted right away...we actually considered leaving. I'm glad we stuck around. I found the menu to be quite thoughtful and the service was very good (Brandon was our server). The smoked wings with the house hot sauce were delicious. In my opinion, Stout has the best draft menu in the area. Most of the selections were from the Pittsburgh area. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Significant improvement to the establishment from Bocktown Beer & Grill.  Quality atmosphere to eat and drink for the summer time once their patio area is open.   Greeted being asked for our reservations which we did not have, while 3 tables lay open in the main dining room.  Wait was estimated to be 45 minutes for 2 however we were seated as soon as our drinks came up at the bar. They escorted us to a back room, which must have been added on during the ownership change as a private party room... maybe 30x20 seating 20 people with 5 tables. This was the loudest dining experience we have had. If seated in this back room we strongly recommend asking to be moved.   We split smoked wings (with ranch, hot & mild sauce on the side) they were phenomenal. Pierogis and a pastrami sandwich with sweet potato fries on the side. Beer selection was strong, no 12oz beer glasses though with 12oz pours.. so the beers looked 3/4 full when ordering.   The food was great and overall an experience we might consider again if it were not for being seated in this back room."}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced, the service is spotty, the portions are small and they try to hard to be weird and different. I'm not picky but most of their food had odd flavors or lack of flavor all together. My boyfriend got the pheasant which was literally the size of a chicken wing with four small round potatoes on the plate. Ridiculous for what you pay. The waitress also forgot everyone's drinks at our table at some point. She would come back with one person's beer and the rest of us would be waiting with empty drinks for the next 15 minutes waiting for her to come back. Nothing here to bring me back."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this restaurant since we were regulars at the prior restaurant in this space. This place did not disappoint. Great decor and atmosphere. All of the food and meat is from local farms. Nice beer selection. We will definitely be back and I would highly recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"We went here a few days after the place first opened and could tell that it already had its business well in order. I got the fish and chips, which were great, my boyfriend got the chicken pot pie, which was excellent, and our friend got the double-cut pork chop--a huge cut of meat--which was also very very good. We will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place when I read the menu online and heard about the concept. However, this restaurant definitely fails to meet my expectations, especially for the premium that they charge for their meals. You expect me to pay $32 dollars for a Scallops dish and give me a plastic cup for water and paper napkins? That's bold... That being said, the scallops we very good but the rest of the frills on the plate were very lack luster. The Furniture also resembles the same stuff they use at chipotle. Definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here yesterday. First time trying this place. Awesome menu! Lots of unique and hearty choices. Shared smoked wings with bourbon sauce as an appetizer and had fish and chips as my meal. The flavor of the fish was a little off but sometimes that can happen, no fault of the chef. All in all it was a good experience. A+ for effort on a unique menu! Server was friendly and prompt. Will return!!"}
{"text":"Great local craft beer selection. The food was tasty. Awesome outdoor seating area.  Everyone who worked there was super friendly.  The bartenders, Lexi and Ben, make great cocktails.  I'm not a cocktail guy but had a swig of the \"Toasted\" cocktail...great coconut rum drink with cream bourbon.  I could drink this for breakfast, lunch, or dinner...really tasty.   Robinson was in need of some more non chain, unique locations. When bocktown closed, I was super bummed out but this is a great replacement.   Only thing is I wish the menu had a little more variety and options.  I live about 2 miles away and I'd love to come back weekly but the menu isn't extensive enough for me to come back for dinner anytime soon. I will be back for drinks for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was good. I had the brisket sandwich and my wife had salmon. Menu has a limited number of food options. There were 30 or so beer options and lots of gin and whiskey options. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the charcuterie board but unfortunately it was sold out so we tried the pork belly bites.  I had never tried this before and actually found them pretty good.  My husband tried the chicken pot pie.  While he said it was ok, he likes the traditional pot pie.  This has a flaky rectangular crust just on the top and it just didn't mesh well.  While it was his own fault for not reading the menu correctly, this version has sweet potatoes in it and he thought they were carrots.  I had the pheasant which basically tasted like chicken.  And for the tiny portion I received it certainly wasn't worth $22; but the duck con fit croquettes that came with it was delicious. Bread pudding good, but not warmed all the way through; comes with ice cream from somewhere in Ohio.  This ice cream is the best!! It is so creamy."}
{"text":"Similar to another review, we were told the wait was 45 minutes when there were 4 open tables on the front. I understand though, could be short staffed, etc. We waited about 15 minutes and were sat in the back room with 6 tables in a very small area. I couldn't hear one word the person I was with was saying. The acoustics are horrific. On top of that, the booths they kept back there are clearly from the previous restaurant. Really, The Yard? You don't have enough money to buy new booths? DO NOT sit back there if you can avoid it.  We got the smoked wings and pierogis. The pierogis tasted like oil and that's about it. The wings were very good, but similar to most smoked wings at most restaurants. The beer selected wasn't anything that I was expecting. Not a big variety, in my opinion."}
{"text":"We loved this place! We moved from Chicago, and we miss the the food scene there. Several months ago, we tried the Yard in Shadyside for brunch and liked it a lot. Stout is from the same owner. In fact, they will be opening another location of the Yard next door to Stout.  There is a great selection of local brews and whiskeys. We did not try the cocktails (it was Sunday night), but they sounded great.  We started with the charcuterie. The meats were smoked in house. The duck prosciutto was all kinds of fatty goodness. The cheeses were local. The pickles and pickled radishes, which are made on site, rounded out the plate. I had the stout stew, which was delicious.  My spouse had the deviled Caesar salad for her entree. She was very pleased. I had the chicken pot pie, mostly because I assumed that it would be a smaller portion. I was wrong. It was huge. It was made with chicken that they smoke in-house. It came in a rich gravy. The portions at this place, in general, are big.   The food is well executed. The drinks are great. We are so glad this place is close."}
{"text":"So for 2 people on a Saturday night, our wait was 30 minutes. Soooo we decided to sit at the outside bar area which was actually very enjoyable. The beer selection is great, and I loved that they had a sampler (4 5oz beers for $10+) menu selection was a great size and they had a nice selection of fish, and vegetarian food.  The pierogi special was all sold out; with the exception of the corn. My friend ordered this - taste was good but is it really worth $14?  Brussels sprouts were ok, but again - $9 appetizer   My walleye was decent, super small portion - I was charged $1 extra for a piece of bread. My vegetables weren't even close to being cooked I wouldn't order this again. ($20 entree)  All in all, I wish the service would have been a little more friendly and helpful. Also, I wasn't happy with not only th small portion sizes but also the prices of the food."}
{"text":"Don't waste time or calories on these pierogies!! They were skimpy on brisket - to say the least for $14 and waaay overpriced for 6 yes 6 small pierogies"}
{"text":"We normally wait for a restaurant to be open for at least a month before trying it, but got lucky with Stout (probably because they own The Yard restaurants, so it's not a TOTALLY new concept to them). The food and service were really good. The menu doesn't mention that the fries are steak fries and sadly none of the fries (steak or sweet potato) were crispy - the oil was clearly not warm enough - probably because a LOT of the items on their menu are fried. They also have only a horrible sounding vegetable medley as an alternative to fries, which seems odd. I don't like sweet potato fries or steak fries, so I was out of luck. Maybe they'll come up with a reasonable alternative once they've been open a bit longer.  The menu is annoying (one-sided and tons of pages) and they've already raised prices on a couple things, though we went there less than a week after they opened, but we'll return. The beer list is sideways in the binder, too. Hopefully, they'll fix some of these issues and mention that their fries are really steak fries when they reprint. The menu is just printed on regular paper, so I'm sure they'll work on it."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I was very excited to have stumbled across this place. The place is dope, and like the build out. The menu looks great on paper but that's where 2 stars fall off. I got \"smoked\" wings that were hardly smoked at all, some of the best fried wings I've ever had but no smoky flavour. My server Harley was great and very attentive to her tables, the two stars are for her. The caesar salad did not live up to the description on the menu. House dressing was missing the salty anchovy flavour. I heard that the place just opened a month ago, hopefully the can pull it all together."}
{"text":"Love TGIF specials.  Place is great. Service was solid, but needs a tad bit of work. Will defiantly be back to try more food items and beer. Patio is sweet"}
{"text":"Was just as surprised to see Stout open as I was to see its predecessor closed.  All new menu and beer options but a familiar gastropub lean.    The pros: Service was great (though it was not particularly busy) Food was great Farm to Table Local/sustainable  The cons: Price (more than your usual lunchtime dine and dash, especially in the Robinson area) Location (maybe this is a plus if you want a \"find\" but nobody is going to see this restaurant who isn't looking for this restaurant.)  I'm eating healthy these days, so I didn't sample Stout's nominal strengths:  house cured and local meat, and local beer and spirits.  At this point everyone in Pittsburgh should know that you can populate a menu in any decent restaurant with food that is locally grown/sourced.    So too, more than ever, brewpubs and ciderhouses.  I didn't do a deep dive into Pittsburgh microbreweries but did enough to know there are 50+ in an hour and a half radius of the city.  You could drink a new beer every day and not have the same beer twice for a year.   But working, and trying to be \"healthy\"...I steered clear of cured meats and microbrews, and there's probably another star to be had for a drunker, less healthy reviewer.    I had a quinoa, salmon and arugula salad.  It was a nice balance of savory salmon on peppery greens with a dash of acid bright vinaigrette and sweet refreshing blackberries.  The quinoa was marinated, and, as someone who hasn't really eaten a lot of quinoa...I found it mixed nicely with the overall salad, and I felt healthier for having eaten it.  It filled me up nicely too.  I didn't notice upon entry, but after I'd left there was a faint scent of cured meats that lingered on my clothes.  It wasn't off-putting, in fact, I've been smelling myself off and on for the rest of today."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come and left extremely disappointed. The bartenders were absolutely awful. I sat at the bar for at least 5 minutes before I was even acknowledged and they only spoke to me when I confronted them. The man sitting next me waited 10 minutes with an empty glass and said that he had been there multiple times with the same issues. The wings were recommended but they were average at best. We ordered a burger and the fried fish and they were nothing to write home about. If you're going to order fries, go with the sweet potato fries. I'm not a huge fan of industry but i would go there any day before I came back here."}
{"text":"I was sad to hear that Bocktown was closing, but excited at the prospect at a new concept in its place, and Stout did not disappoint. Really love that their menu is hyper local and that their bar also pushes local brewers and distillers. All the food we had was good to very good. My favorite item was probably the pork belly bites, perfectly crispy with a nice sweet sauce. The brisket and pastrami sandwiches were good as was the burger. I do find the prices to be a little bit high for a dying strip mall in Robinson, being owned by The Yard, I feel that they priced their menu more accordingly with downtown or shadyside. Also our service was very average. Our waitress was nice and attentive, but made numerous mistakes. We live in Greentree, so we come to Robinson a fair amount, and Stout will be in our rotation, but I don't think we would make a special trip just to dine here. For the money, I believe there are better offerings elsewhere."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. We had drinks, wings, charcuterie plate and a pastrami sandwich.  The waiter recommended a delicious beer to start with. All PA beer and spirits. Started with the charcuterie plate. Really unique and tasty. Duck prosciutto, yummy olives and a carrot chutney were highlights. Switched to a great PA rye to wash it down. They cure their meats in house and you could tell with the pastrami. Cool preparation for sure.  Table next door got the wings and we couldn't resist. Smoked first and then cooked to perfection. More rye for desert. We will be back soon"}
{"text":"Great alcohol selection - big props for having Arsenal Cider! We got the smoked garlic parmesan wings for an appetizer & they were delicious. My husband liked his pastrami sandwich and sweet potato fries. I got the brisket sandwich, which was good but the meat was a bit dry. The service was good.  The outdoor bar set up is nice; hopefully we can take advantage of that next time. For GF guests: GF buns are available, but I don't know how good the kitchen is with cross contamination. The fries aren't safe as there's no dedicated fryer."}
{"text":"Came to stout for the first time and we were told our wait would be around 25 minutes so we went outside and sat at the bar. About 50 minutes passed and we went up to the front and asked what was going on and they said they tried texting us but we never received a text . So that was already a bad start. As far as the food it wasn't the greatest. The meat was good but the sandwich was mostly bread. And everything we tried had some sort of apples in it and I'm not really a fan of fruit in my food...the atmosphere was cool but i can't say that I will be back any time soon!"}
{"text":"First of all I must say the service was good and the restaurant was beautiful! The food on the other hand was just awful! I have never been to a restaurant where everything they served was just darn right bad! The soup came out cold and clumpy, the brussel sprouts were mushy and greasy, the wings were way overcooked (burnt on one side)and had no flavor, the brisket was ok but I couldn't eat it because the bread that it was on was so hard and burnt I couldn't bite into it and the ff were soggy! Even the ranch had no taste. In sorry but I just wouldn't recommend this place to anyone to eat."}
{"text":"Worst meal we've had in awhile. We ordered 2 apps.. a brisket pierogi and the Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were delicious but soaking in a liquid sauce.. I like mine a little more crispy. The Brisket pierogi was an awful greasy skillet of mush.    Then we ordered another round of drinks and she only brought mine. Later asked if he'd like another and at that point he just said no.   Next, our food came. My salmon was completely raw so I asked for it to be cooked more. It took 20 min. The salmon quinoa salad I ordered was a salmon fillet on top of a handful arugula, quinoa, and blueberries for $16.   In the meantime I figured I'd try his brisket sandwich because it looked good. It was cold and dry. I had to ask twice for extra sauce.   I'm always understanding especially being in the service industry but the restaurant was not overly busy.  We won't be returning and I would never recommend this place.  Very unimpressed."}
{"text":"I know it's new but the staff need to smile a little. A little would be nice. Make me feel welcome while you take my money."}
{"text":"Nice pub with a good beer selection.   Food was just okay though.   Duck nuts were burnt and bland.   Smoked wings were the best item we had.   The Deviled Salad, I added Salmon, was awkward and the Salmon was cold."}
{"text":"Had the sweet crepes, and they were amazing. Berry compote and a cream filling that wasn't too sweet really balanced each other. Highly recommend for brunch or lunch! Indoor/outdoor bar is a fun twist. Draft beer choices are not extensive, but there is enough variety for almost anyone to find something."}
{"text":"I was excited to see Stout open and couldn't wait to check it out. I joined a friend for lunch and was overall very pleased. We started with the Brussel Sprout and pork belly appetizers. I really enjoyed them both. The Pork belly was definitely my favorite of the two. For entree's I got the Apple & smoked chicken salad on a baguette with sweet potato fries. This was amazing. The chicken salad was so good and the fries were excellent. I requested a side of ranch and their ranch is a herby homemade which I loved. My friend got the brisket pierogis. She enjoyed them but wished that there was a little more sauerkraut that came as a bed underneath.  The staff at Stout is awesome. Everyone was really nice and attentive. They have weekend brunch and also a special pick 2 lunch menu for weekdays. There is a fine beer selection and also a great page of fresh cocktails. I opted for white wine this time,but I will be enjoying cocktails on my next visit. I will definitely be back to try more things off the menu!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite new spot in the Robinson area! The charcuterie board is great, as are the sandwiches. I've had the corned beef, pastrami, and brisket sandwiches and they really can't be beat. They are each dressed up differently, with mustards or krauts (one even has a bacon jam!) and the bread is SO GOOD. The fries (sweet potato or classic potato) are clearly house-cut and are delicious. They have a great selection of local beers and the happy hour is great (half off all drinks and $3 off apps, not including the charcuterie board). I'm looking forward to trying their selection of mains, which aren't available until after 4 pm. This place is halfway between work and home, so I can see myself getting into some trouble here. Great new place, go check it out!"}
{"text":"The idea of Stout Pub & Kitchen is great, but location not so much. The cocktail and beer selection is wonderful! I would for sure go back for some drinks. The food on the other hand...not too sure. My date had the chicken pot pie, it was mildly cold and the flavor was alright. On the plus side the presentation of the chicken pot pie was very nice. The Grilled Chicken Thighs...everything was cold, but I guess it's served that way? That should possibly be stated on the menu."}
{"text":"Chicken salad was huge and very filling. Loved the hot wings. Of course the beer selection was fantastic with mostly PA sourced options. Staff was knowledgeable and provided samples. Have been back since for brunch and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"They really renovated this place quite nicely. We loved the opened indoor/outdoor bar. We ordered the smoked wings as an app and they definitely were one of the best I have had. (Plus the  handmade ranch was fantastic) For dinner I had the pastrami, which I would not order again.  It was warm and chewy. The sweet potato fries were great though.  My husband liked his burger however I was not wild about it. We will return for happy hour and apps, we just may skip the entrees next time !"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but not memorable. The atmosphere was a little heavy with hipster pretentiousness. Overall, a step down from Bocktown."}
{"text":"Ordered the charcuterie plate, $13 or $15 can't remember exactly. The description said it was an assortment of pates, terrines, cheese and meat--something like that anyway. I wanted some pate or terrine. What I got was really small portions of store-bought salami, about an ounce (literally) of smoked salmon, 4 triangles of packaged pepperjack cheese (how exotic), some slivers of cheddar cheese, and some toasted french bread.  Nothing was homemade--all low quality stuff you can get at any mediocre supermarket.  When I saw the plate, I asked where the pate and terrines were? \"Oh, we changed it.\" I said this is fraud. \"I'll let them know.\"  Well, I don't know who \"them\" is, but I'm letting the rest of you know that this place doesn't seem to care if its food doesn't even remotely match the menu's description. And clearly the staff did not care about my complaint.  2 other guests had dinner salads, salmon, chicken, that looked OK. They seemed happy FWIW. Me? I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First I will say the restaurant is beautiful and the bar area is very nice. There is a large local beer selection. Our waitress was also excellent. I really wanted to like this place since the yard is one of my favorite places. The food is a good concept but my friends food was cold and there was not that much for the price. I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night. We were big fans of the previous location that used to occupy the same space. That being said we enjoyed how open the new owners made the space.   The beer selection was good and included a small number of local brews. The happy hour lasts until 6PM. Drinks and appetizers are best priced during that time. We ordered the fried pork belly and thought that it could have been fried a little more. The skin was not as crisp as it could have been.   The main entrees we got was the chicken thighs ($16) and the brisket sandwich ($14). We will start with the good and that is the brisket sandwich! It was amazing. That is what got the 3 stars here. That was really good and had enough food for one person. The bad is the chicken thighs. Those were dry and can be replicated at home with little effort. The small potatoes that came with them was ice cold. Literally ice cold. The waitress was really apologetic and corrected it right away.   The waitress was really nice and very good. The atmosphere was very loud, first daters should be aware. You can't have a conversation about anything there.  Overall a solid three stars and has room to improve. The staff is good but the space could use a little sound dampening. The back of the house could use a little quality check. Total check was $71.00 including the tip for 4 beers (2 half price), 2 meals, 1 appetizer (half price)."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Nice staff. Pulled pork sandwich was fantastic! The place is really cute and has a nice outside bar. Good atmosphere"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Gastropubs and after reading reviews and glancing at the menu I chose this place to dine at with a friend. We both got the flank steak salad which was highly suggested by our waitress. Just when I thought that it wasn't possible to mess up a steak salad I was proven wrong. Visually it looked appetizing enough but for $16 the portion was more akin to an appetizer than an actual meal. I never can finish anything that I order at a restaurant including a steak salad. Not only did I finish this but I had to make plans on where to eat afterwards. In retrospect it was a blessing in disguise that the portion was small since it was barely palatable and I left more than a few of their \"candy\" tasting tomatoes behind.   So where did this dish go wrong? Way too much sugar; why any at all? Why do the tomatoes taste like they were candied? Why did the dressings (blood orange and another that I will assume was balsamic vinaigrette) taste like liquid sugar? I know how to make a vinaigrette and this was not it. The portion size compared to the price was way off, especially given the poor execution of the dish. Finally unseasoned flank steak; did anybody think to even salt and pepper it let alone add anything else? The salsa verde tasted like fresh from the can.The only reason that I did not complain and send this back was because I was on a first date and wanted to focus on that in a positive way. My date also found the dish to be sugary as well. Afterwards we agreed that we should have went elsewhere. My verdict is if you can't master a simple dish then I don't have faith that a more complicated one will be completed either let alone mastered."}
{"text":"I only stopped in for a beer and an appetizer. The bartender did not appear to be happy in the least to have a new customer at the bar; perk up like you just opened a restaurant. Good selection of beer.   I was not impressed with the Pork Belly bites.  The menu indicates the belly is confit but it looks like it's been in a deep fryer, thus lacking some flavor.  I imagine it's confit before service and then fried right before serving?  I thought the belly was under seasoned, as I had to salt it.  Even weirder is they drop RAW blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries in the bowl. I understand that fatty pork belly always goes well with some kind of sweet/acidic sauce, but they missed it here.  A chutney or jam with concentrated flavors is more appropriate I would believe."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this place opened literally days before we were there! WOW! It was great.  Best parts: We were greeted immediately by John, the bartender. He asked our names, was super friendly, made great suggestions and also makes a mean Loddy Toddy. I don't know who was there when people got the stink eye, but it wasn't this group. They were fun and engaging.  Food. The bomb. We had pierogies and wings to start (Owners: get blue cheese. Just do it. I'm bringing my own next time if not. :) ) Then split a brisket sandwich that neither of us could put down. Drippy and delish. We also split fish and chips. Also great, but I was so stuffed I could barely take two bites.  They pride themselves on being strictly local. Food from local farms, beer and spirits from local breweries/distilleries. I love Pittsburgh, and I love local.  Can't wait till the patio opens and we can come BACK! John said he would save us a spot at the patio bar. Okay, He didn't, but I hopes he reads this and does so anyway. :)"}
{"text":"Hey everyone!     Let's address the elephant in the room.  The location of Stout pub sucks. It is in Robinson, but it's tucked in and hard to find, plus the sign is tiny.  Had I not read the review on Yelp, I would of never tried the place.  Now on the to good stuff. Before you even enter the front door, the place smells amazing. It has a camp fire, bourbon, wood grill smell, that draws me in like a moth to a bug light. Once in the front door, the smell only gets better.  We were greeted and seated quickly. The waiter fetched us some water and explained the menu.  He informed us they have been only open about a month. They, as much as possible, use Pennsylvania sourced food and liquor.  Plus they source their food locally and are a farm to table restaurant. They also smoke their own meats and home make a lot of other items. The decor is steam punk/hipster, it works well and seems well designed.   The food:  We ordered the brussel sprouts for an appetizer.  I have a serious brussel sprout addiction. These were very good. They were  just the right amount of soft and crispy, with a soy-ish sauce and home made pancetta.  I highly recommend this app.   Lunch:  I ordered the pastrami sandwich and my date ordered the chicken salad sandwich. My sandwich was very good. It was paired with stone ground mustard, some greens, and those little pickled radishes.  I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Both meals were very good.    So all in all this place is worth trying. The new decor is very popular right now, and I always feel a little hipster when I eat somewhere like this. The homemade and locally sourced foods and liquors make me feel good about supporting PA. It's nice to see something like this in the south/west hills.  If you like Cure in Lawrenceville, you'll definitely like this place."}
{"text":"Great waiter, very attentive and pleasant. (It was the muscled dude). Very clean with cool decor. Open and light up. Cool vibes and good feel. ALL the beers on tap are from PA, more need to do this. Had the Brussel Sprouts and Olives, both were great."}
{"text":"Stout was fantastic! We had ratatouille that was wonderful, fresh and served with house made ricotta. the brisket sandwich was out of this world and served with house made pickles and fries. and also got a pork chop to go because we really wanted to try it but were so full! It was definitely the best out of everything we ate. everything is sourced locally and locally grown which adds the freshest taste to all of their menu items. We had brussels sprouts to share at the beginning of our meal they were roasted perfectly. Can't say enough about the good people who work here. Definitely try stout the next time you're feeling like a great meal."}
{"text":"The pheasant was excellent as well as the bread pudding. Great selection of local beer and liquor.  Farm to table and great service."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Robinson restaurant. It is located where bocktown used to be.  The menu is unique, and everything we ordered was super tasty.  We saw the fried chicken and waffles come out and that looked amazing.  I also love the new layout and how breezy it is when the bar area is open.  It was so nice to sit inside but have all the fresh air blow on us."}
{"text":"Great menu, Awesome food, great atmosphere,  Wonderful staff.  Dustin the waiter provided great service.  Will definitely return!   Brussels sprouts are a must get!"}
