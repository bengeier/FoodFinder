{"text":"The gal at the counter told me the food was \"life changing\".  I was clearly suspicious my life would be changed; however, I don't think my palate will ever be the same.  I had the Jerk Chicken Sandwich and the flavor was out of this world.  What a culinary explosion in my mouth.  YUMMO and DEELISH.  I love the concept of takeout only as we like to eat in the comfort of our home and love all the variety of ingredients they use in their food.   I'll be back to try everything on the menu!!  Please don't close!"}
{"text":"This is the best quick food option in Verona. Hands-down.   The sandwiches here are delightful, delicious, delectable. Great ingredients in great combinations. Plus, it's affordable. I recommend calling in orders ahead. This place can get popping around the lunchtime rush.  The Banh Mi isn't exactly what you would expect given the name, but it's a delicious sandwich. Don't compare it to the Vietnamese cuisine. It is great as a lunch sandwich. I felt the same about the jerk chicken sandwich. It's delicious, but not exactly what I was expecting. They tout local ingredients, and I haven't been disappointed yet.   The cold sides are a nice addition. Too often you get chips/fries with a sandwich. The sides are varied and cater to different tastes.  To summarize, these sandwiches might not be what you expect, but the kitchen always crafts a sandwich worth eating."}
{"text":"Outstanding high-quality food, great menu options that change frequently, great service! They are very accomodating to specific dietary needs (grain-free, dairy free, etc...).   Also an easy place to find things my kids eat.  Mac and Cheese, small containers of fruit, sausage/cheese, etc...  We are addicted."}
{"text":"Good place for takeout. I tried today's specials and got impressed by its fresh and quality.It's a small place but everything is cute and traditional. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. I will definitely be back. Both the Veggie Melt and Meatball Sandwich were amazing. For cold sides we both had cheese and sausage, the latter I assume being homemade. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Just had the Turkey wrap with corn tomato salsa as a side. It was awesome. Small place, but they recently expanded to have an eating area. Friendly service. I've probably been here 10-12 times now, never disappointed."}
{"text":"Though prices are a little on the high side, you can tell the ingredients are of a high quality. The service is friendly and efficient, and the menu offerings are unique and creative. I felt welcomed when I went to try it out, and would love to to back.   I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with spicy slaw and got the glazed sweet potatoes side for $10. I really enjoyed it-- I thought the flavor was excellent and the quality/quantity of meat was great, especially compared to the other lackluster sandwich spots around Madison."}
{"text":"Jordandal cookhouse hit the spot again today. I've eaten here several times in the last few months and every time I am satisfied with their ample portions and delicious offering. I've had the cubano sandwich, mac and cheese with pulled pork, and the shepherd's pie and would recommend all three of them. The average meal is 10-12 dollars but I'd say well worth it especially in Verona where there aren't a ton of local options. They've added an indoor seating area, but I usually call ahead and pick up my order. The staff have been courteous and I'm excited to go back for the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Wonderful cooking with top quality ingredients.  This is a taste of restaurants as they should be - comfortable, healthy, friendly, and supporting the community.  A double blessing for those away from home spending there days in EpicLandia."}
{"text":"Not only the best take-out in Verona, but Jordandal Cookhouse has the best food in Verona. I'd eat here before any sit-down restaurant in town.  We tried the barbecue spare ribs (Friday night special) and the ginger-soy chicken. Both were excellent. The ribs came with coleslaw, baked beans, and cornbread. The ginger-soy chicken came with glass noodles (with onions and peppers) and  plenty of lettuce for wrapping. We picked the summer sausage and cheese for the side.  And before you leave with lunch or dinner, make sure to check out their frozen food menu. They have frozen pizzas, soups, pasties, meatballs, beef stroganoff, pork fajitas, pate and bolognese sauce. I think I also saw some pork chops and bacon.  Also, check out Jordandal's up-to-date menu on their Facebook page. There are always great daily specials!"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch with my husband and we both had awesome meals, this is our second time here for a meal but we always buy their meat at the farmers market (so good). I ordered the turkey melt but on sourdough it was heavenly!! My husband had the Cubano which he really enjoyed as well. We had the sweet potato and fruit salad sides, and finished by splitting a caramel machiatto cupcake- was awesome! We look forward to coming back soon want to try some of their breakfast and dinner! Cute place and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find out I could have great tasting Gluten Free Meatloaf!  Staff were very kind, helpful and accommodating.  Small establishment but clean and quick to serve.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"This is my update after giving Jordandal a second try.  This time round I sampled the nachos with pulled pork which comes with two different salsas and a orange infused sour cream along with the friday night special of pork ribs with bbq beans, slaw, and cornbread. Dessert was a jar of butterscotch pudding.  It is with great dismay that I can not up-rate my previous scoring of 2 stars.  Once again I simply did not enjoy the food. I think the chef and I have a very different view on the flavors that jive. I simply thought the sweetness of the pork and flavors of salsa and cream did not compliment each other. The ribs, though fall apart moist, were covered with a dry rub and bbq sauce that I did not care  for and the beans were undercooked and the slaw bland (I could not finish the ribs, beans, or slaw).  I wish Jordandal the very best and encourage folks to give them a try. Perhaps you will like it...? but I can not fairly rate them any higher."}
{"text":"I visited Jordandal after it was highly recommended by a friend of mine... stopped by on my way home for takeout.  There weren't that many selections but I opted for the Cubano sandwich.  After about a 10 minute wait (one other couple had placed an order ahead of me) I got my brown paper bag and headed home.  My first disappointment came when I took my sandwich out and saw how puny it was.  For $9.50 I expected a little more (even though it does come with a large side, which I didn't really want to begin with).  My second disappointment came when I saw that the \"roast pork\" specified on the menu (and expected by me) wasn't roasted & sliced pork at all, but a skimpy smear of pulled pork.  The final disappointment came after my first bite, when I realized there wasn't much flavor to be had in the sandwich at all, and I was much too far away from Jordandal to complain.  It's highly unlikely I'll be back."}
{"text":"We finally got to eat lunch here and it lived up to the hype.  There were 6 items I wanted to try, but only had room for 1.  The special was a brisket sandwich. It was on sourdough and I would have it again.  The cold sweet potato salad was also delicious. My wife enjoyed the veggie melt with Asian salad.  The prices were right for what you get.  The value is there with the food being so fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"The only place I come to when I come to town! Fresh yummy food. I'm smitten with their meatball sandwich :)"}
{"text":"We decided to stop through Verona and try this place.  I had an excellent Cubano sandwich!  It also came with choice of a homemade side salad."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a rainy, cold spring evening in search of some comfort food I could take home to a hungry family. The service was friendly and attentive - the girl behind the counter directed my attention to the daily special and she helped me choose from numerous delicious-sounding dishes off their normal menu. Food was produced quickly but clearly some preparation was involved (e.g. it wasn't scooped from a warming tray) and as I drove home it smelled great.  I live only few minutes away and we sat down to eat right away - but we had to reheat the food because the containers didn't keep the heat well. (That's my only complaint and it's a small one.) The food was otherwise delicious! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! Excellant food and service. I went in with major dietary restrictions (no dairy, gluten, legumes, sugar,or grains) and they were able to give me an incredibly delicious and flavorful meal.  I frequently travel to Verona for business and this is my new go to place. You must go!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars?  Must have been another bad day or else the cows should be fed more than just grass. Or, maybe this town just needs a new restaurant. I had the  meatloaf which was recommended by the person who took my order.  It's pricy for a place that looks like a cafeteria and the meatloaf followed suit. This place is across the street from two hotels. I think the re picking up the gravy. Smart move."}
{"text":"The best place for takeout in Verona. They don't have an extensive menu but what they do have is excellent.  I'd especially recommend the grilled cheese (with onions).    Note that the restaurant is a take out counter and there are only a handful of picnic tables outside. So I'd advise going to a park or taking the food home."}
{"text":"I just came to visit my brother and am in town for a few days. I am so glad I came here! I got the veggie melt with cold peanut pasta salad. It was clearly made with fresh ingredients. The flavors were so distinct I could taste practically every vegetable! I would def recommend this place for any tourist or a local who hasn't tried it yet!"}
{"text":"Love this place..I got the sausage breakfast sandwich on a cabbietta bun ..it was wonderful.... I was stuffed halfway through but had to eat it all....ingredients are always fresh and they offer a wonderful unique menu that changes day to day....smaller place with only a few tables but it's worth the wait...they also sell organic bulk meat and pre made fajita mixes ...can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Worth the trip for a delicious lunch! We had the fully loaded chili, mac and cheese, and caprese french toast. The cheese on the french toast was delicious! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Roast beef melt, no melt.  Not any flavor. Thai spicy salad?  Just very bland. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I would go there just for the smell alone.   Original dishes for lunch or dinner.  Plenty of healthy sides to choose from. Friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Bonus points: Accidentally took a vegetarian with me and they made her a custom salad on the fly."}
{"text":"I had the Banh Mi. It had tremendous potential, but was just a touch unbalanced (not enough acidity/tartness). Still very good/worth it. The sides were lame. Overall this place is a gem."}
{"text":"The food was good but the setup was somewhat strange. Being from out of state I'm used to a different dining experience when at a farm-to-table restaurant. Ordering at the counter wasn't horrible, but I almost felt rushed to order rather than looking at a menu. If I would ever happen to be in the area again I would definitly give it a second try."}
{"text":"First time here on our way to Oshkosh we stopped for dinner.  The server was pleasant.  She recommended the Cuban.  It was pretty good, I wish it had more sauce.  It had a lot of pork.  The tomato, brisket, potato soup was delicious with just the right amount of salt and pepper.  I also had the dark chocolate bread pudding as my side.  It was pretty good, but not the best I have had.  My wife had the walnut black bean burger and really liked it.  The big downfall was kids meals.  We got macaroni and cheese and a cheese quesadilla.  Our kids wouldn't touch them as they are made with a fancy farm fresh cheese.  I tried to make the kids eat it, but then I tried it for myself and agreed it was gross.  I can't actually remember not liking a cheese before so that surprised me.  Stinky, bleu, parmesan, cheddar, soft mozzarella, I like then all. This cheese was not good and definitely shouldn't be used for the kids menu. Everything else was good, just don't come with kids."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! There aren't many places that have menus that makes me want to try everything! I ended up getting the white cheddar mac and cheese with a polish sausage. I was very satisfied with my decision but I can't wait to go back and try everything! It's a little pricy but portions are large and it's local, nutrient rich food!"}
{"text":"I visited them twice this week on my trip to Epic. Steak sandwich is out of this world. Great place for a quiet meal."}
{"text":"Very nice food with good ingredients.  I tried taco and beef sandwich.  They can be rated very high.  However, I don't think I can afford the super high price again."}
{"text":"Lunch here was delicious. I love the seating area (don't know how new it is, but new since I was here last a few years ago). The chili was a great serving and well cooked with fun toppings like tortilla chips that aren't usual. I had the summer salad which had tender strips of steak, gorgonzola, organic asparagus and radishes on it. I highly recommend this salad if you're in the area. For $12, knowing (from them in particular) that it is as local as you can get it,  the salad is a great value and serving size."}
{"text":"I found a little gem in Verona.  Ordered the unconventional but amazingly delicious Bánh mì sandwich and was pleasantly surprised with the quality and freshness.  Also had the chili and coleslaw which were traditional with the same level of freshness.  I'll be coming back here the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Spectacular food, all super fresh. Love the bahn mi. They just expanded their place and have decent sized seating area now, too."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit here with the family! The outside is very unassuming.... we pulled up to the small strip mall and I was kind of like 'this is it?!' but it was deceiving... Inside they have a nice spacious dinng area and it was decorated very cute! You check out their board and order/pay, and then the food is brought out to you. The woman working the counter was very cheerful and eager to answer any questions you have. My only make regret (and the reason for 3 stars) is ordering their Friday fish special! The first was just bland and SUPER overcooked. Like, pure rubber.... It was just not good. I did enjoy my loaded baked potato and corn muffin though! And as my brother pointed out... You don't come to a place that specializes in meat and get the fish! Oh well....so my brother had the cubano and he was super impressed. My husband got their rib special and damn was that good! I seriously loved the rub on his ribs... The special was a half order and I swear they gave him a whole rack! Anyways, trying his ribs was enough to convince me to go try this place out again."}
{"text":"When I came here for the first time, I was with my roommate. He ordered the Cubano and I got the Bahn Mi.  First I took a bite of the Cubano and exclaimed, \"That's the best sandwich I've had in Wisconsin!\"  Then, I took a bite of the Bahn Mi and exclaimed, \"That's the best sandwich I've had in Wisconsin!\"  My roommate agreed.  I'm lucky enough to have a place like this out in Verona where I can grab it to go for lunch. I'm even luckier that they throw in a cold side with every sandwich and sell kombucha too. At some point, I'll come back and buy Jordandahl meats from their meat cooler on the way home. Maybe I'll succeed at making my own sandwiches that come close to being as tasty as the ones they make."}
{"text":"I was on a business trip in Verona and wanted something delicious for dinner. Got some recommendations from the front desk at our hotel and had to check this place out!   It was one of those places where you come in, order off of their small menu and sit down. They bring it out to you once it's ready. The servers there were so great and helpful when trying to decide what to order.   My co worker and I ordered their fish tacos, Brussel sprouts, and the pork chop. Their claim to fame is the farm to table food. Local and delicious. Their food was so amazing!!!! So fresh, so delicious, and made with love!  I ended up coming back the next night and got some nachos. Best place in Verona!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. If I lived in Verona or worked at Epic, I would eat here every day. The atmosphere is super casual, simple and friendly. The food is unique, extremely fresh and tasty. Wow, I can't say enough about how great everything tastes."}
{"text":"This place is definitely pricey for portion size, for about $10, it's smaller than you expect.  But the ingredients taste... fresh. It's kind of weird at first, how light and clean everything tastes. Their combinations are definitely interesting too.  I'd recommend trying the banh mi (not really similar to the viet kind) or the shepard's pie (amazing veggies, cornbread crumble, yum). The meatball sub is pretty solid too, but I wasn't a fan of the southwest beef bean wrap."}
{"text":"Great food even without the organic-friendly menu. Meatball sandwich and cubano worth going back for. Loved it!"}
{"text":"It's an odd location, don't be turned away by the outside.  This place had some great homemade food in this little town of Verona. I had the cubano sandwich which was good. I went with the broccoli salad side. My friend had the veggie burger which she loved. Not too turned on by the sweet potato salad, just ok. Also it was a long wait for this simple two sandwich meal, about 20 min.  They had some great looking brunch menu items, would like to try these some time. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Amazing! I've loved their local meat at the Farmers market and was so happy when they opened the cookhouse.  I live downtown, but if I'm anywhere near the west side, I make sure to pick something up.  I love the grilled cheese, mac and cheese, the rachel, the muffaletta.  I want to try everything.  I love the amazing options of sides you can get, I've had the veggies and hummus, cheese and sausage, and a wonderful citrus quinoa salad.  If you haven't picked up their bacon, ham, creme fraiche frozen pizza, you are missing out.  Also take the opportunity  to pick up some of their frozen meats or prepared items while you're there."}
{"text":"Our go to place for brunch!  We have taken so many friends and family members here, we have lost count. With fresh food, great flavor, and a simple menu, Jordandal has quickly become our favorite spot for breakfast.  My go to is the breakfast tacos and smashed sweet potatoes, a little bit sweet, a little bit spicy, completely delicious!"}
{"text":"This isn't much of a review and it wasn't much of a visit. I went there for a burger and the clerk said they ran out a couple of days ago. Oh well."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast and I'm not much of a breakfast fan but Jordanal Cookhouse may turn me into a believer. (Breakfast only served on Saturdays.) Everything is absurdly fresh and it's obvious most everything is made in house. My first visit I had the Farm Fresh Breakfast Sandwich and wow, just wow. The bacon jam actually had giant chunks of bacon in it unlike most bacon jams which just kinda taste like bacon. My dining companion at that time had the Farmhouse Breakfast and a waffle on the side. The waffle came topped with homemade whipped cream. Again, I'm wasn't a fan until I had THIS whipped cream. Homemade whipped cream is something everyone should taste.   My second visit I did a make your own breakfast of sorts by choosing a couple of sides. One of which was the jowl bacon. Yes, bacon made of pork cheeks. Possibly one of the best things I've ever eaten. My mom was with me for the second visit and she had the veggie scramble which was the special of the day. She thoroughly enjoyed it and loved that she could taste that her scramble was cooked in real butter. The smashed sweet potatoes are not be missed.   I can't wait to come back for lunch/dinner sometime. They also have a freezer up front with frozen meats to go. Everything from bacon, breakfast sausage to various cuts of beef and pork. There's also a cooler with bottled beverages along with puddings in a jar (topped with that amazing whipped cream) as well as various cold dishes for grab and go.  Service on both visits has been extremely friendly and prompt. Order at the counter, grab your silverware then grab a table of your choosing. Food gets delivered to your table. Coffee and water is self-serve."}
{"text":"Their breakfast menu has been going for a little while now and is definitely worth the visit.   The breakfast sandwich is flat out amazing (avocado, bacon jam, sausages, hoagie, and egg...best over easy). Best in Madison for my money, just edging out the ham jam sandwich at Crema Cafe (which is a good refreshing alternative, though).   It's a little intense, though, so I recommend splitting the sandwich and the enchiladas between two people for the best breakfast in madison.  The Breakfast potatoes taste really good too!  (Don't change anything about the sandwich though. It's too amazing.)"}
{"text":"The Jordandal Cookhouse is a small takeout storefront recently opened by Jordandal Farms, known in the Madison Area for quality meats. The menu has a variety of sandwich-centered options centered around those meats with some additional items available during dinner.   We ordered the Bahn Mi and the Ginger-Soy chicken. Both were very good. The Bahn Mi had sausage, ham and pork pate on a delicious, crispy french roll. The chicken came with rice noodles and lettuce for wrapping. And both came with a choice of a side - we got sweet potatoes w/ bacon & a corn-based salad.  Located in a small strip mall about a mile from Epic's Campus (which, I'll assume is the reason you are searching Yelp for food in Verona, WI), the interior is small, with just enough room for a takeout counter, a fridge and freezer. There were a few chairs and a table outside.  If you're staying in Verona for Epic-related business, and aren't looking to venture into Madison for food, Jordandal Cookhouse would be my first (and only) recommendation."}
{"text":"The most amazing and original shepherds pie I have ever had! Fantastic gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"A nice, no frills place for a bite to eat in Verona. All the ingredients are fresh and sourced locally. The menu isn't super adventurous, but strays off the beaten path for the neighborhood at least. The banh mi sandwich is better than any I've had in Madison and environs. The tacos were delicious, if a bit overstuffed. (Spread the fillings across 3 tacos rather than 2 so we can eat them without a bib or a hose down afterwards!). I wouldn't recommend coming for dinner since the dining room closes at 8, but I'm guessing the dining room is livelier at lunch."}
{"text":"This is everything you want in a local restaurant. They source local, high quality ingredients and everything tastes fresh. I have been impressed with every experience so far.  Service is super friendly. There isn't a lot of seating but they package food to go that tastes just as good when you get home.  You can also buy meats, prepared fresh and frozen foods, and great coffee with house made creamer."}
{"text":"Quaint, whole-wheater eatery in a stripmall. Dining area was small and filled with second hand furniture, so, not a place to go for a romantic night out. Think more utilitarian.  Food was fresh and healthy. Tons of sides to choose from. Would be a great place to pick up lunch to go."}
{"text":"Stopped her a couple years ago and liked it so thought I'd try it again. Worth the stop for a quick bite! Tried the pork tacos and although not spicy, great taste with sweet Cole slaw topping and thin slices of jalapenos and red onion! The corn tortillas were perfectly warm and doubled-up which really helped with all the juices flowing. Definitely will stop again when in town."}
{"text":"Delicious, creative, unexpected, unique! I will make sure I stop here every time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This place was a gem.  Awesome menu, fresh food, light, flavorful and low fuss.  I loved that you could eat there (2 outside tables) or take it to go - a sweet deal especially if you're staying at the Holiday Inn across the street.   All the dishes we got were top quality - the sides were awesome - especially the berry-wheat salad (it was an eye opener for us).  When done eating, we were stuffed, had left overs, and didn't feel heavy or bloated.  The only concern I had was that we had 2 kids and was worried about not being able to eat there - with them only having 2 tables (really just 1 large enough to accommodate children) - so if you go with kids, be prepared with a backup plan.  Also, their menu isn't very kid friendly - only options were grilled cheese & pbj sandwiches, but it worked - and was the best grilled cheese sandwich my wife and I had (good thing the kids weren't hungry :))"}
{"text":"On my way to the Wisconsin Brewing Company, I was in dire need of food and found that Jordandal Cookhouse was pretty much the most-recommended place in Verona.   A small place on the edge of a strip mall, you definitely wouldn't notice it unless you were looking for it. I drove by it twice before I found it. Inside is a simple counter to order at and to the right, a small dining room with tables, chairs, silverware, and water.   Being the macaroni and cheese lover I am, I obviously opted for that covered in pulled pork. While the pasta was cooked well and the cheese sauce was creamy, it was seriously lacking in salt. Seriously as in, I added salt to almost every bite. Constantly. Maybe the pasta-water wasn't salted, maybe they didn't add parmesan to make the sauce salty. I dunno. Just make sure you have your shaker handy. The pulled pork was tasty but a little dry--mix it into the macaroni and cheese so it gets a chance to soak up some of the cheesy deliciousness.   In summary, the food was well-cooked and has the potential to be a five-star dish (at least the item I chose), but it needs a little tweaking to get there."}
{"text":"Yum- the sandwiches we had were really good.  I had the cubano and the pulled pork was juicy and the flavors were good.  It was on ciabatta bread that soaked up the flavors but did not get soggy and fall apart.  The chili was really flavorful and meaty.  My husband also tried the banh mi sandwich just because, well, he's Vietnamese and was curious.  And surprisingly, the banh mi flavors were all there!  It was on a ciabatta roll with a spicy sausage, ham  and liverwurst.  Midwest meats but with Vietnamese flavors- spicy mayo and pickled daikon and carrots.   The place is simply designed- kinda like an old office turned farmhouse restaurant.  Could've used a bit more decor.  Bathroom was clean.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very solid breakfast food on Saturdays. Unfortunately they are closed on Sunday.   Not the largest menu in the world, but what they do, they do very well. The biscuits & gravy is my favorite because not only do they have amazing sausage in the gravy, but they add their pulled pork as well. Yes please! Bottomless coffee is also a nice touch, and looks like they have recently added pitchers of mimosas to the menu, for people who want to start the party early on the weekend! Definitely one of the better breakfast spots in the Verona area. I just wish they were open on Sunday!"}
{"text":"I had friends in town for the Iowa vs. Wisconsin football game and we were looking for a quick breakfast that wasn't too far away--my friend ended up finding Jordandal Cookhouse on Yelp, and I have to admit that I was skeptical because I've lived in the West side of Madison for 3 years and had never heard of it.   It was only an 8 minute drive into Verona and we were all blown away at how good the food was, and by the cute country decor. Two of us ordered the breakfast tacos (one with smashed sweet potato and one with American fries and our other friend ordered the scramble (which happened to be a free special for veterans, in celebration of Veterans Day & our friend is an Air Force vet)! The food was exceptional and although the restaurant was busy, our service was great. They do have a limited menu and limited beverage options, but definitely worth checking out! I'm happy to say I have a new brunch spot near my house!"}
{"text":"Good but... I went because I follow some reviews. The taste was a mixed of flavors. I order the Cubano sandwich, small and hard bread but good beef. I ordered the white cheddar mac with pork on top it was very good. The white cheddar mac was amazing!   Con: Small place but has a great furture ahead of it!"}
{"text":"Great local produced meats which turn into great sandwiches. Expanded menu after 4PM. Also have a special everyday for sandwiches as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Per other reviews, maybe we hit an off-day???   No matter the reason, we did not enjoy our food and would not return."}
{"text":"I stayed at the hotel across the street which recommended this restaurant. I liked the vibe of the place. All of the food is locally sourced, farm to table with craft beers also from Wisconsin. I placed my order at the front for fish tacos with a side of pre-portioned broccoli with bacon in a container which you take out of a refrigerator next to the front door. It's better to pay in cash - they add on a 3% charge if using a card. I sat down and waited a little while before the food was brought out to the table. The tacos were okay, I finished my meal but I probably wouldn't order them again. The cold broccoli with bacon was good. It had a nice sauce to go along with it which I enjoyed. I don't doubt other things on the menu are good though. I will go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Small menu and dining area but freshly prepared food.  Enjoyed the special. Convenient to the hotel location."}
{"text":"We were in the area for a state basketball tournament and saw this place on Yelp and decided to check it out. Everything was absolutely amazing! I had the white cheddar Mac and cheese and that was delish! My daughter had the steak sandwich and loved it, my husband had the French toast breakfast and had to fight the two of us off because \"one bite\" was turning into one slice. Don't let the outside appearance fool you, the food inside is great. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches will blow your mind. They are hot, flavorful and full of quality meat/cheese. Definitely not the cheapest I've had, but well worth it. If you want cheap go to subway.  The Patty Melt is a gift to your taste buds. One bite and I thought I had died and gone to heaven. The bacon mayo is a perfect compliment to the juicy burger. I can't even describe how perfect this tastes you just need to go try for yourself.  Friends also love the Cubano and the bean and beef burrito. The sandwiches come with a side and there are some good ones to choose from. If you're near Verona and want take out, please give Jordanal a try!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  We had a lunch of the patty melt and the Cubano and sides of ginger slaw and jalapeño slaw.  Perfect and filled with the Jorandal meats prepared with great care."}
{"text":"Came for a late breakfast on Saturday morning - breakfast is only served on Saturdays. The sandwich was amazing: egg, cheese, sausage, bacon jam (!!), and avocado.   I considered ordering a second entree just to try more.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great food. I love what they are doing. I also love seeing their specials on facebook."}
{"text":"Have had breakfast here twice while visiting. The food is fantastic! Ordered take out. Once it took 45 minutes, and once 20 minutes. It's a busy restaurant for breakfast! Definitely worth the wait. We ordered the farmhouse special. Homemade biscuits, really tasty potatoes, good quality bacon, and fresh eggs!"}
{"text":"I stopped here with my daughter for breakfast, Nov 12, 2016 right as they opened. It's a sit down place but you order up and then they bring your meal out to you. I ordered the French toast with bacon and a side of sausage. They didn't have decaf coffee so I just went with water ( they have bottled and from the jug like at an office). The food took maybe 15 minutes to arrive and wasn't particularly cheap but the food was very good. It tasted fresh, or at least (good!) different from your more upscale, breakfast place or chain restaurant. The relatively sparsely decorated eating area is fine for kids with a 'farm eclectic' mix of high and low tables and at least one bench setting. You clean up after yourself and separate your trash, recyclables and dishes."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a farm fresh meal. The staff is friendly and knowledgable. The meatloaf was filling, spicy and awesome. The root side veggies were fresh and seasoned really well. They carry local wine, beer and homemade desserts."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and decided to check this place out. The food was great, so I actually came back twice. The first time I went I had the special, a short rib sandwich topped with slaw and sliced apples, along with a side of Asian salad, Mac and cheese and a slice of pumpkin pie for dessert. The sandwich was my favorite--- great fusion of flavors. Asian salad was okay and the mac was a little runny for my preference, but it was tasty once I added a dash of salt and pepper. Pumpkin pie was also pretty good.  My second visit I had the meatloaf dinner with mixed veggies and mashed potatoes. This was all pretty good too, once I added a dash of salt and pepper."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, very busy. Service didn't reflect that though. Like the design/layout of the interior. A whole lot of fun, if you've never been, you need to go. Will visit again."}
{"text":"I have no idea what all the hype over this place is about. The food was terrible and the attitude to go with it was even worse. I'm all for the concept of eating fresh, locally, and sustainably, but the menu offerings miss the mark. Almost everything on the menu is fat-laden, \"exotic\", and way over-priced. I think this place could be significantly improved by offering a few healthier options. For $33 we had chicken cordon blu, farmhouse nachos, and a \"cinnamon roll cupcake\". The $3.00 cupcake was absolutely, hands down the WORST pastry I've ever hand. It had no resemblance to a cupcake and was so dried out/hard that the texture reminded me of tasteless shortbread cookies. The nachos were not good either. Basically, it was a pile of chips with some tasteless shredded beef, a huge gob of melted cheese, and the occasional jalapeño or olive. The chicken cordon blu was almost unidentifiable. Perhaps I should have gone with the 3,000 calorie three meat scalloped potatoes entree? I wish I could support local and this place is a neat idea, but I honestly have to say that I would never patronize this place again, even if it was the only restaurant within a 100 mile radius."}
{"text":"This place is the best lunch food in town!  And I can't wait for the dining room to open in November.  All local food on this diverse menu.  Most options come with your choice of side. If you have not,  stop here for sure!"}
{"text":"Real farm food, real good dishes.  A to-go only place that has fresh veggies and tasteful meat. The entries they serve taste at least on-par if not better comparing to Epic's. Though the price tag is high I might still prefer getting things from this place just for the fresh and healthy veggies."}
{"text":"Best take out in Verona!!!!!  Everything is good, I am especially fond of the pork tacos, loaded grill cheese, and flour-less peanut butter M&M Cookies.  Made from scratch with a chef's touch.  My hubby enjoys anything with pork or beef.  I have also tried a number of their specials and I have never been disappointed.  The owners are always there and the service is stellar.  Do yourself a favor and wait the 7-9 minutes for awesome take out."}
{"text":"Wow! Jordandal Cookhouse has made me a believer in farm to table goodness. Only, there are no tables.   I had the Friday night rib special with the most delicious beans and cornbread. The meat fell off the bone and the BBQ sauce was tasty and tangy. Some guilt rushed through me as I thought of the pictures of the farm's pigs hanging on the wall next to the cashier, but then the deliciousness of the meal caused more primitive instincts to take over.   Will definitely be back to try the salads and maybe the butterscotch pudding too..."}
{"text":"I liked the cilantro and garlic steak, even though it leaked all over my car! Friends really enjoyed the mac and cheese, meatloaf, and BBQ there as well. Small place - you won't be able to sit down for food. A bit pricey for the portion but you know where it's coming from (local and sustainable farm), so I'm cool w/ paying more."}
{"text":"Today was the best lunch in forever!  I had the walnut black bean burger, asian slaw and the BEST cupcake in the world!  It's so nice to eat something totally different and creativel!  Plus, I didn't feel like I should say I am sorry to myself, since there was no extra junk in my food like everywhere else!  Thanks for the meal, I will be back again!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Holiday Inn directly across the street from this little gem.  I saw 'farm to table' so I had to try it.  I ordered the Shepard's Pie, a cup of their homemade chili, and the meatball sandwich.  The prices were on the high side for this food, but I understand why.  The Shepard's pie was okay but very bland.  The chili was really good.  And the meatball sandwich was kind of bland as well and pretty small for the price.  If I come back to Verona, I would probably stay at the same hotel and most likely give these guys another try."}
{"text":"Jordandal Cookhouse is Amazing!! If you want local FRESH food that is cooked with excellence, you have to try this place.  It's pretty much take out only, but is totally worth it. So far I've had the Cubano, Pork Tacos, Hummus plate and their homemade wings.  Everything was really tasty!  I cant wait to try their ribs on a Friday night, and everything else they have on their menu."}
{"text":"This place is great for quality takeout food.  It has a smaller menu, but everything is made from scratch and they use meat raised on their farm.  The people that run it are very friendly and provide great service.  We had the pork rib stew over egg noodles (huge serving!) and the cubano sandwich (comes with one side).  Both were very flavorful, no complaints.  We also snagged two flourless peanut butter M&M cookies at the last minute and we were not disappointed!  I would stop there just to get those cookies.  They have a daily special, which I am looking forward to trying soon.  Great carryout food is much needed, and theirs can't be beat.  Try it for yourself, you will not be disappointed.  Support local business!"}
{"text":"I guess I need to go back here because it sounds like I am one of the few not to walk away satisfied and excited to come back. I had the fish tacos, which must have been a seasonal special, but I found them to be pretty mediocre. I would have preferred more fish, less tortilla (especially because the tortillas must have been stale or something, as they kept cracking and making the dish difficult to eat. I came here during lunch one day since it's so close to Epic, and thank god the only picnic table outside was open, or I probably would've been eating in my car. I did like my cucumber salad side, though.  I thought it was a little expensive for some very average fish tacos, but my friends all rave about it so I'll probably give it another chance. I think it would be nice if there were more light options, since everything was pretty heavy (either really cheesy/meaty, mayo-s, etc.). Normally I'd like this, but I guess on that way I was looking for something healthy..."}
{"text":"Quite simply the best breakfast I've had in Madison. We each ordered a different dish and all 4 were exceptional: french toast, breakfast chili, farmhouse breakfast, biscuits and gravy. A word about the biscuits and gravy: I am always looking for good biscuits and gravy but had just about decided that it could not be had north of Illinois. I stand corrected. This gravy was creamy and rich without being greasy or too milky and was studded with lovely bits of pork. It is not a spicy sausage gravy but is absolutely delicious. As well, the chili was the best I've ever had. Ever. You'll have to pick up your own water, coffee, cutlery and bus your own dishes but so so worth it."}
{"text":"The flavor of the ribs were delicious they just didn't have much meat on the bones. It came with coleslaw and a cornbread muffin which were both pretty good. I like the farm to table idea. I would try them again and get something different."}
