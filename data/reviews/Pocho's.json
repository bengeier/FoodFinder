{"text":"Clean environment.  Cashier seemed confused about menu and options. Read menu to tell me what I could plainly see. I had the Mexican burger. It was a mess falling apart bit awesome taste and heat. Fries were hot and crisp. I wanted to try the onion rings but that goes back to the menu confusion of the cashier. Overall, I would return  Breakfast is a large part of the menu so more of a focus I assume."}

I never tried it with tajin and it also included some little pineapple pieces, it was different which I like a lot! Their burgers are great as well I go with the Mexican burger I like my food with some spice to it, also try their chipotle sauce     Give this place a try it's worth it."}
