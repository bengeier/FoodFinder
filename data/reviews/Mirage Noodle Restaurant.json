{"text":"I made a mistake by didn't check any review before walking into this restaurant.  This is a typical run down restaurant with no renovation and poor service.  The name in the restaurant has beef noodle in it so I assumed it can't be that bad and ordered a Taiwanese beef noodle.  Here comes the noodle with big disappointment, this does not look or taste like any proper beef noodle doesn't matter which part of Taiwan it is.  They don't use the proper cut of beef and for the price of close to $8 they really went cheap on it.  It didn't taste like beef noodle a bit.  We also ordered another small dish of braised beef with cucumber which we barely touch, it's simply horrible.  To cut it short, avoid this place at all cost and there are plenty of choice around here."}
{"text":"Read Amy Z's review so I decided to come and try this place. I had hope for this place because I'm a noodle kind of guy. Walked in and an elderly mandarin speaking woman seated us. She did not speak a word of English or Cantonese, which made it hard to ask for things. Luckily, ordering was done by writing, so ordering wasn't bad. I got the braised beef noodle soup and steamed pork bun. The noodle was pretty good, chewy and tasted good. Although it was good, it wasn't something out of the ordinary. The steamed pork bun was something else.. Terrible. The flour was not fully cooked, so it was still pasty and the meat was dry. There was absolutely no juice coming out of it, which turned me off so quick.. I had a few bites and I left the rest. I wonder how this place has survived up to now..? There are multiple restaurants in this plaza that is better or have higher potential than this place. However, I do think some tinkering here and there would make this place great.. Won't be back again."}
{"text":"The food quality is very low. The thickness of their dumpling skin is way too thick. 
The \"well known\"?beef noodle soup is tasteless with cheap thin slices of beef. 
Don't expect any presentation. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Wow! This place really IS a hidden gem.
We went here hungry af after finding out vietnam noodle star was full and the waiting list was longer than the line to meet a celebrity. 
We first walked in because the outside looked pretty reliable.. we were reluctant when we were faced with a doctor waiting room door lookalike and the inside was basic with zero renovations (minimal design, paper taped up to the wall, plastic tablecloth etc.) But hey, I guess they saved a lot of $$ that way.

The service was not amazing- they only spoke mandarin but as long as I can order, it's fine. Ordering is done on a piece of paper and the menu is english, so it's all good. When the food came, we didn't know whose it was and when we asked him, he stumbled around and didn't come back with an answer- we were left to guess. Also, the mandarin shows they're playing on their TV is quite loud and since they don't have many customers, the workers mostly sit in front of it watching the entire time.
This place is definitely family-run and has regular customers that come, eat and go. It's not a place to sit, linger and chat.
The food however, wow! You can tell they make the noodles by themselves (lai mein, for all my canto folks.) and the broth.. amazing! It doesn't taste commercial or generic. Hot and sour soup with noodles - highly recommend.
The broth is clearly a homemade recipe that they've tweaked to be unique - I'm telling you, you can't find a similar soup that's made as well as this anywhere..
In the end, we paid $27 for a 4 person meal and we were all full and satisfied.
THEREFORE, YAY! Must come back here and try more."}
{"text":"Should have checked the reviews first. One thing that would make the experience here much better is if they had some TV or music playing. Often with these family run places you get a TV because then the owners/workers can watch something. It would make this place feel a lot more crowded with some sound. Otherwise, it is really quiet in there.

The one guy who works/owns this place was on his iMac in the corner and doesn't feel that interested in helping until asked.

For food, had the beef noodle soup which was good actually. Broth could have had a bit more flavor and had more spiciness though. The other dry noodle we had, the zha jiang mian was good too.

For an appetizer we ordered the house specialty of onion pancake with egg and pork floss. Egg i saw, pork floss appeared non-existent.

Just get some sound going! It'll go a long ways!"}
{"text":"Needless to say, we weren't able to check Yelp reviews before coming here, which is always a hit or miss. But after finding the place on Yelp after I ate here, I was morbidly surprised by the negative reviews!

Sure, the waiter isn't the friendliest or most talkative person ever, but the food was cheap and good. What else can you expect from a hole in the wall joint squished next to a bunch of other Asian restaurants in a strip mall? Sure, it's hard to stand out, but the beef noodle soup was tasty, and we also enjoyed the potstickers. We also ordered the beef/egg pancake roll or whatever it's called. We ate everything! I would've expected at least a three star for this place.

Who cares if they use plastic bags as table cloth? It's efficient and makes it clean and easy for the next person. I am really used to the raggedy night market style dining from my years in Taipei, so this place was really not that bad."}
{"text":"I came here to get a quick snack, had the milk pudding I think it was called. It was steaming hot, not too rich and overpowering - exactly what I was looking for. I didn't try anything else so can't comment on their main items."}
{"text":"Does not exist anymore, so regardless of service or food which wasn't very good, it is no longer available"}
{"text":"Mirage Noodle Restaurant is one of the numerous hole in the wall Northern Chinese Restaurant that opens up in Scarborough area. 

They specializes in both Northern Chinese food and Taiwanese food according to their menu.

The place is a little dirty.. a little runned down... a little messy..

A nice Chinese lady greeted me in Mandarian.. and she hardly speaks any English.. OK time for me to practice my limited Mandarian.

There are a lot of different items to choose from. There are also lunch specials for $4.99 which mostly rice dishes.. I decided to try the Zha jiang mian (Minced Pork Noodle) $5.50 and Spicy Potato Salad $2.99. As usual I requested them to be extra spicy...

The noodle arrived. The noodle is quite chewy.. and warm. The meat sauce is not spicy for sure! The taste is a little bland.. but is not bad.

The potato salad though as not as spicy as the usual ones I have. But the dressing has a good kick of sourness... and the potato is crunchy and refreshing.. 

Business for sure is not too good here.. There were only another table occupied the whole time I was eating there! When there are so many other choices in the Finch Midland Centre, I am not surprise at all!

I would not be back to eat here again.... though I feel sorry for this little family runned business!
