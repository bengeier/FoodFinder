{"text":"I' have ordered takeout from this place several times, and the quality and pricing is better than average, in Mississauga. The sushi tastes good, and the presentation is above average as well, despite the industrial feeling ambiance.

What really bugs me about this establishment is in the finer details. Once I ordered 6 rolls, a Yaki Tori Udon, Tobiko, Tempura, and a Katsu, and got about 1/2 a teaspoon wasabi, to distribute between myself and 3 others. I gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt, and the next time I ordered, I got the exact same quantity. Not even enough for one person (my family and I love wasabi).

The next time we made a takeout order, we called the restaurant and asked them if they could please give us a reasonable amount of wasabi per roll. They said that it would cost extra. We said that we did not want 'extra' wasabi, we just wanted a reasonable amount considering that  this meal is going to feed 4 people. They told us to hold, and spoke with the head sushi chef, and when she returned she just said \"okay anything else?\". When I brought takeout order (#3) home, we got EVEN LESS than the last two orders (I really wish I had taken a picture - it was absolutely ridiculous how little we were given). That was truly disappointing, and it was actually hurtful. Imagine if each person got 1 roll, as takeout and everyone had to ration wasabi from one container. It was so little that you would not even be able to taste the wasabi.

The employees and head chef appear nice, but in my opinion, they're a little passive aggressive when it comes to providing quality Customer Service. Out of principle, I refuse to pay \"extra\" when we weren't even supplied an adequate amount. Wasabi isn't even that expensive, so I don't know what their gripe is about having to make people pay for a 'reasonable' amount. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Really good sushi... For some reason the korean /Japanese mix works here... They are actually pretty good at both....

I had their sushi deluxe combo and wasn't disappointed...

Had their bulgogi and spicy beef soup... Not bad at all..."}
{"text":"Great lunch time sushi bar - bento box selection is nice, menu is reasonably priced. Smaller restaurant but can handle larger office lunch groups. I've been here twice with my coworkers and we've been very satisfied."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better sushi places in Mississauga. This place has excellent reviews on numerous websites, which is well deserved. 

Firstly, the service was quick and awesome! The food surprisingly came out quite quickly.  

I ordered maki rolls, which were quite good. They were fresh and well formed with little to no fillers (damn tempura!). Beware: the spicy mayo is actually quite spicy! 

Overall, I think if you're a sushi fan residing in Mississauga, you should definitely check this place out. By the way, it's quite easy to miss, so drive slowly! :-)

A winner in my books! I will be back! Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, however the service was lacking. The help buttons on the tables really do nothing. It service was the only reason I gave it a 4 star."}
{"text":"This restaurant was such a wonderful find. The miso soup was excellent, the tempura was wonderful and the edamame were perfect. The sushi boat we ordered was fantastic! 

You get top quality sushi at a very reasonable price point."}
{"text":"possibly one of the worst korean food restaurant in mississauga. we went there with a party of 10 during company lunch time, arrived around 12:15 and didnt get our food until 1:30, they didn't give out korean side dishes like ALL other korean restaurants. I ordered their Bulgogi Bibimbap and it was just sad, unlike other bulgogi bibimbap I've had, their version is just beef and plain rice.. cost me $12. Will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"Sushi here is great.  Like the spicy salmon and the roll that comes with garlic sauce.  I don't see many reviews about this place even though it's definitely worth a try.  Rolls are good quality as well."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about Sushi in Sushi! I've been coming here once a week at least since they opened (needless to say, they know who I am!) You'll always get a warm welcome when you arrive, and a thank you when you leave. The family is so nice - it's the type of place you want to see succeed. It is the best sushi I've found in the area. A step above the more expensive sushi at JJ's Japanese Thai, a place which always seems to be packed. I want to herd those folks over to Sushi in Sushi!

The sushi is always fresh and modestly priced. For someone like me coming in on my lunch hour, I can get in and out in 30 minutes easily. They are quick, polite, appreciative and most importantly, make great sushi. Their miso soup is delicious, and I would recommend the Green Dragon roll. When they first opened they would bring free appetizers of broccoli and spicy sauce, as well as deep fried tofu. I never had tofu period until I came here, and it was delicious.

I'm so happy to see other good reviews so this restaurant can be profitable. They deserve the business and you won't be disappointed if you give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd or 3rd time here. Today, while waiting for my take-out with a beer, I was treated to gift from the kitchen. A phenomenal piece of tuna belly, and a morsel of fried tofu. 
I am a carnivore a heart, but the tofu was the standout of the two.  It melted in my mouth like a piece of fried butter!  I am so used to using firm tofu, that this soft form just fell apart among the light crispy tempura batter on my tongue.  
Can't wait to get home for the rest of my dinner!

PS Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"My mother had a concert at Meadowvale this past Saturday, so we came over to order takeout and bring it back to her for dinner. It was a little difficult to find this place, given that it is a right turn almost immediately as you're going down the hill. The sign is also somewhat small and hidden!

We ordered the two roll special (Alaska and California for $8.99, as well as another two person sushi and maki set with Dynamite rolls, spicy salmon rolls, a few pieces of nigiri (4 salmon, 4 red snapper, 2 shrimp and 1 red tuna).

Overall, I wasn't expecting much and indeed, the fish was rubbery, limp, and dry. For my dynamite roll, a part of the shrimp tempura that I had was also quite fishy and smelly. The spicy salmon rolls were also doused in sauce... not the best.

That being said, this is obviously a hole in the wall looking to please those who want a cheap fix of sushi. With that goal in mind, it does the job just perfectly fine! You get generous portions for what you pay for (we paid a little under $40 for three people)."}
{"text":"There are (in my humble opinion) three reasons to write updates to old reviews.  

1.)  When you''ve changed your mind about a place
2.)  When your experience was drastically (and consistently) different from the last time you reviewed 
3.)   When you feel the need to inform everyone about something pertaining to the restaurant or its food. 

Well, I'm going with number three. 

This place is STILL amazing.  I rarely write updated reviews, but I had yet another unbelievably warm and welcomed lunch at Sushi Inshushi this afternoon that I just had to come on here and say it again: 

Go here.  I know it's tucked in a corner, but it's right down the road from Erin Mills Town Centre and so worth it if you like sushi. 

OH.  Vegans, the vegetarian selection is awesome and unlike your normal sushi joints- when you order an asparagus roll- you have tips of the asparagus aesthetically peeking out- in true Japanese style.  DO NOT MISS THE YAM ROLL.  And their miso is made without bonito (fish flakes) and its DELICIOUS. 

It's been ages since we were in here last and they remember that my husband liked spice, and I didn't, and even though we ordered the exact same meal- they brought his with spicy sauce on it and mine without.  We didn't even ask.

Support this local family.  The food, the service, the atmosphere = excellent. 

That is all."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you, the inside is adorable, quaint and the sushi delicious. Great for a go-to sushi place at an affordable price. My fiancé found this one lookin for dinner near a friends place... Loved it but wish the service was explained. We waited 15 minutes before finding out you pay up at the sushi bar :/"}
{"text":"Well since JJ Japanese was closed ( and I'm glad it was) or else I wouldn't have come across Sushi in Sushi. This place is a cute clean place. I ordered miso soup, vegetable gyoza, green dragon roll and dynamite roll and it was all amazing. The price is right and the customer service was very friendly. They even have a \"help\" button on the tables, which is so convenient as opposed to trying to make eye contact to perhaps get their attention, like most restaurants. I'm so happy with this place and I will be returning very soon :)"}
{"text":"Service and attention to the customer is seriously lacking; however, the rolls were pretty good. Not the greatest al la carte place I've been too but definitely in the top 5. I would order take out next time. 
Edit: took them down to one star from three since they charged me $1.50 for hot sauce. I feel as though you shouldn't be charged for a condiment especially if it made your meal to your liking. This is how businesses nickel and dime people; poor customer care."}
{"text":"I like the look and feel of this place a lot. The staff is super friendly, the décor is nice and the prices are decent. I only had time to order 1 roll because we got there at 9:30 pm but the spicy salmon roll was good, it just had a bit too much sauce on top of it, I'll know for next time to ask for less.

I'd eat here again to try the Korean food, and because the menu has quite the variety. Something for everyone and the specials change daily. Check their website."}
{"text":"I pulled up on Saturday night hoping to see a bunch of parked cars assuming this restaurant was good. Not even a cockroach in sight. I was a little nervous to try it but now that I just came back from the place, I can safely say the food is very good. Almost as good as Sake Café in New Orleans. The California roll is excellent. So is the dynamite roll.

Try it. Its good."}
{"text":"On the fence about this place, but I did really like it. 

They have good lunch specials, a list of 20 different combos, from sashimi, to rolls, teriyaki and even kabli. Around $7.99-9.99 each. 

I opted for udon because it was cold and rainy,but it was pricey $12.99 for tempura udon.
It was really good, but realized later due to too much salt or msg. I felt dry and thirsty all day. There wasn't enough noodle in my soup either. I finished it quickly. 

I would come back again and try one of their combos."}
{"text":"Alright, I ordered a sushi/sashimi deluxe dinner for $21.95 which came with sashimi, assorted sushi and a spicy salmon roll. The roll and sushi were delicious and fresh, and the sashimi was fresh but not the best I've had.

For the quality food, I would give it a 3.5/5.


However the waitress I had was completely out of it, almost as if she just woke up from a nap.  Keep in mind, I did come alone at 4 pm because it was a late lunch and they may have been in shock.  However, she would stand at the cash and just stare without paying attention to the surroundings.  I had to wait 5 minutes before I just got up and went to the cash register to ask for tea.  I did the same for the bill.  Also, when she was serving food to the other table, she didn't even look my way.  It was shocking for a Japanese restaurant to pay little attention to the customer.  This is why I won't round up to 4.

However, maybe she was new because the sushi chef was really nice.  He made me feel comfortable whereas the waitress didn't.

Overall, I'd still visit again, maybe at a more prime time as it's fairly decent."}
{"text":"Hey everyone, didn't get to eat here, but they do not deliver! Just a warning to anyone expecting that they do"}
{"text":"First time visit was for lunch. Excellent meal. Not out of the ordinary, but the subtle scents of the entire meal were awesome. Nice friendly staff and Sushi chef.

Tempura was done just right, California rolls were good, the sashimi was my favorite."}
{"text":"Delicious maki rolls and good filling to rice ratios. The bf and I ordered two japanese maki rolls, salmon sashimi, large salad and kimbap roll. First off the portions are generous. Large pieces of sashimi and large rolls. We had to take a full roll to go as our eyes were way bigger than our stomachs when ordering. One roll, plus appetizer is more than enough per person. Las vegas roll was my favourite item. Generous portions of fish (salmon and tuna), very fresh vegetables and perfectly deep fried. Pickled ginger on the side is not coloured pink, but naturally pickled. I have been at other restaurants that make it themselves and this tastes the same as that. While not advertised as homemade, I am assuming it is based on taste. Kimbap had high quality pickled ingredients that would taste great individually and together.

The only disappointment was that the salad dressing tasted too much like soy sauce and there was too much of it - probably 2/3 of a cup sitting at the bottom of my bowl. 

Great little hidden gem! The exterior and signage looks a little old, but the inside is very nice. I would definitely recommend. I will be back next time I am in the area! :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. I spent $50 worth of food for two and the service was terrible and the food was served warm. I can't fathom why the service was so poor when they only had two tables to serve on a wed night. 

The food quality was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Great large slices of fresh and delicious sashimi! Specialty rolls has good fish to rice ratio. Everything seems to be made fresh to order and even the tempura were generous portions.

In the dying breed of ala carte sushi restaurants standing up against the evil that is all you can eat (mostly chinese run) sushi restaurants in all cities, this is one of the few gems left. 

Don't get me wrong, I still like ayce and buffets because lets face it I like getting my bang for my buck. But I won't agree that the quality is the same and sometimes I just want a good top quality piece of fish in my dinner instead of slivers of slightly less than fresh fish. 

The vegetarian bento box my friend got smelled and tasted delicious. She especially appreciated the fact that you can choose the items to include in your bento which at other places she remarked always costs her a few bucks extra. 

Their korean menu is pretty solid (expected since they are korean ^_^) My friend tried their bibimbap and although the fried egg instead of the raw egg was served the dish itself looked packed with fresh veggies and beef. They also did the bibim sauce on the side which is rare in chain run or other korean restaurants in sauga. 

They have discounts on their daily rolls of the day specials! Also a plus is that their salad is never limp and lifeless but fresh and had a delicious dressing on top. 

I'll be back when I feel like $15 of great sushi is all I need! Only com[plaint was that after the order arrived, the server never came back and due to the high partitions we couldn't wave anyone down for more water. Had to walk up to the cash to pay."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Took half a star off for service and décor.
Sushi in Sushi is in an automall area.
Beside some yellow garage.
I was happy it was opened on Family day Monday, and the reviews were good so I was excited to check it out.
I ordered the spicy ramen. I've never had this before except for instant noodle at home and that's what it tasted like. But a bit better.
And it kept growing on me!
I also ordered the sushi/sashimi dinner combo (SD5 for $21.95).
Too much food by the way.
It looked small because it was on a large tray but I was STUFFED after I ate that and the spicy ramen soup.

The SD5 comes with a small salad which had a delicious dressing on it. I ate it all.
It also comes with Miso soup which was pretty good, it could be a tad hotter.

The spicy salmon was really good. The green dragon roll my boyfriend had was equally as good.
The sashimi was thick and tasty but too much for me.
I definitely liked the rolls the best, better than the nigiri.
I would absolutely visit this establishment again.
They have daily specials and great sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Another great find thanks to Yelp!

I came in for lunch and was greeted warmly as I walked through the door.

I loved that they had classic jazz playing on the speakers and the decor of the little restaurant was cute and clean. There were about 8 or 9 tables plus 4 seats at the sushi bar. Small and cozy.

I ordered a lunch box and was completely stuffed! On top of the box items I was given agadashi, noodles in broth, miso soup, and veggies with a spicy sauce. The green tea was piping hot too. The sushi tasted fresh and was presented very nicely. The sides were great too.

Totally fabulous!

TIP:   If you need an oil change, drop off the car next door at the new Economy Lube and come here for lunch while you wait."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Sushi In Sushi, and the rolls were pretty good. 

The red dragon roll was delicious, the black dragon roll was decent but more dry compared to red dragon roll, and the lobster roll was not flavourful compared to the others. That being said, the lobster roll was pricier than the red dragon roll so my expectations were higher. 

The restaurant is a little old but has Japanese decor which makes it feel authentic. Pretty good sushi in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Since we moved to GTA, everyone's been saying, \"you'll have no trouble finding good sushi in Mississauga, or out in Brampton, or try Markham.\" I am happy to report that we'll look no further. We tried sushi at Axia, which was pretty good and very affordable- a boat-load (literally) of sushi for $16. The sushi was oh-kay. I imagine Axia's other dishes are stronger. We tried Sushi in Sushi after scoping around on the web. I am so glad that we were sent to this tiny little building behind a 7-Eleven. 
The service is amazing. What a lovely hostess and waitress. We told her it was our first time and she showered us with kindness. We felt like regulars in about 5 minutes. 
We ordered green tea which, to my surprise, was properly prepared! No tea bags for these people, and none of that yucky green powder. Yay proper tea! We then had a gift from the kitchen, something I haven't had from a sushi restaurant in 10 years. Three small dishes: fish balls, noodle salad and some greens. Num. Num. Num. Priming the tummy for some premium rolls!
Oh the rolls. Oh my. OMG. We ordered a medley. We stuffed our faces with traditional rolls and rolls from their specialty sushi menu. So good. The spicy sauce is spicy people. We love hot food, and I do mean love it, but this was a whole new kinda heat! 
We had such a wonderful experience our first visit, that we returned shortly. I decided based upon the quality of the roll construction, the freshness of the ingredients and the overall quality that sashimi would be the next order of business. Much to my buttery fish loving appetite's delight, the sashimi was all I ever hoped for. 
The service continued to be pleasant and our daughter is loved and adored by the wait staff (at least they pretend to like her very much). 
Papa's got a brand new bag. Mama's got a brand new sushi joint."}
{"text":"The only place in meadowvale that serves fresh sushi at a reasonable price. I had the sushi set b which was more than enough. The service good and the location is nice too. Nothing too fancy but gets the job done."}
{"text":"Before we entered Sushi in Sushi, I saw the stickers from Yelp and Urbanspoon; I knew I was in for a delightful meal.  We ordered a Kalbi dinner ($20) and a Bento Box C ($18).  The portion of the Kalbi was *big*.  It was tender and tasty.  I thought it could have been marinated longer, but my BF thought it tasted just right.  Many reviewers praised the freshness of the raw fish slices, whether they were served as sushi or sashimi.  I totally agreed and would like to add that the chef did not stuff the maki rolls or nigri with rice.  It had made the food much more genuine.  I had to add that the tempura was perfect, just perfect!  It was fried crispy on the outside, with just a really thin layer of dough.  It was hot, tasty and moist inside.  I don't usually enjoy fried food, but I enjoy the tempura here much.

Sushi in Sushi is indeed a delightful find in Missasauga.  I will return if I am in the mood for fresh sashimi and when in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Can't believe it's been 4 years since I visited Sushi in Sushi! Anyways, I decided to grab some sushi for lunch during my lunch break. I decided to give Sushi in Sushi another chance after reading some good reviews.

That day I ordered two orders of their salmon sashimi ($2.50 for 2 slices) and their $7.99 lunch special (6 california maki rolls and 6 spicy salmon maki rolls). The ladies working there were friendly and pulled out a chair for me so I can sit and wait. It didn't take very long until my order was ready. The salmon sashimi's were large and tasted good. However, the way it was sliced was ugly. The maki rolls were average but I've seen better maki rolls elsewhere. I thought the spicy salmon rolls had way too many crisps on them.

Overall, my lunch was alright. Maybe I'll return after trying out the other sushi joints nearyby."}
{"text":"It looks sketchy from the outside, but is very comfortable and tasteful inside. 

The food was great, we ordered the dinner boat medium. The spicy tuna rolls and dynamite rolls are especially nice.

Also, the service is great and dinner came swiftly.

I didn't like how the sashimi was cut - small and thin, however."}
{"text":"Not too much in terms of an update.  Still a solid sushi place in the area that's NOT AYCE!  The restaurant was quiet when I visited, just 2.5 occupied tables, so if possible, I wanted to throw some business their way via an updated review.

Obviously slightly pricier for dinner, so consider sharing the nigiri/maki/sushi boat options.

Visit this hidden gem that's tucked away behind the 7-11 gas station if you're in the 'hood!"}
{"text":"Really lucky to be living close to a great sushi place again since I'm really picky! I would definitely recommend.
The rolls are a good size but not awkward to eat. They have lunch combos which are a great deal. They will offer you green tea while you wait for takeout, and the ambience is not bad for a sushi place!"}
{"text":"The sushi has always been really quite good. The prices are very reasonable. The people are very friendly. They play tasteful jazz music. Just a great place all round!
On Wednesday there the Volcano roll is on special, which is like a regular roll, but heaped with extra salmon goodness."}
{"text":"Maybe I am a sushi snob because we have amazing sushi in California but this was just a step above grocery store sushi, if that. The owners were really nice though..."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  My take out oders are always correct and I got to finally dine in on New Years Day!  Yes they were open... and busy!.  My husband enjoyed his Spicy Chicken Hot Pot served on rice and side of Kimchi.  I had the Tempura Udon... broth was well seasoned.

Servicing Japanese and Korean dishes.

Behind 7 Eleven"}
{"text":"Went for their lunch menu. Miso soup and the dressing for garden salad was better than a lot of other places. Sushi was okay, Tempura too oily. 
Good ambience, nice and clean place. Good but not exceptional."}
{"text":"I first came here when it opened and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and service provided by the owners.  It's run by a Korean family who clearly takes pride in what they do.  The restaurant is tucked away in an odd location (beside a car garage) but inside the restaurant is a quaint and clean traditional Japanese styled space.

The service is always prompt, courteous, and warm.  You're greeted by the owner/chef with a smile and you can seat at the bar or at one of the 9 smaller tables nearby.  The menu is mostly Japanese but it does have a fair number of Korean dishes.  For lunches, they have set boxes that are good value.  The prices range from 8.95 to 12.95 and this includes real authentic green tea (with rice pieces!), salad, miso soup, fruit (honeydew slice), sushi rice, and variety of entrees.  I've had the bulgogi (sliced beef in a sweetened soy sauce), salmon teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, and tempura options.  Everything is freshly made, hot, and good tasting.  Portions are not large but is a good value for the price.  The salmon is fresh, succuluent, and has good charred bits.  The bulgogi is flavourful and not dry.  The tempura is not oily or heavy.  

You can quickly get your lunch and finish within 30 minutes but the atmosphere is relaxed and calm with the classic jazz being played over the speakers.  I highly recommend this place to try if you're in the area for lunch!

-----

I want to update this review.  I came here over the weekend for sushi and unfortunately it doesn't live up to the cook foods as much.  The sushi chef is great... he's attentive, kind, and is really interested in taking care of his clients.  I think the problem is that he doesn't have a lot of traffic so he can't offer a large variety of sushi at a good quality.  He offers good quality but really low selection.  In my set, I usually get at least 8 or so different types in a 20+ piece order.  I only got 4 selections and in that 4, it was predominantly salmon and tuna.  The salmon sashimi was great.  Smooth, melt in your mouth, and good sizes.  The tuna was not great... not chewy but not at all flavourful.  The butter or oily fish was tiny.  The yellow tail wasn't plentiful either.  

I did see him make a few orders of the maki rolls and they were generous in size and also look great in terms of what's inside.  The people who ordered were raving about the taste and textures.  So it sounds like this chef really excels at maki rolls.

If you're wanting making rolls or a la carte sushi, try this place out.  I think it'll be good.  If you're wanting sushi or sashimi sets with variety and quality, I can't really recommend this place (even though I BADLY want to... they're such great owners and I always want to help local businesses out).

----------
I returned back for lunch and I wanted to note that the maki rolls are where it is at!  They're LARGE and really well crafted.  They're not full of rice.  Instead there are plentiful of good fish and vegetables and well crafted.  They don't fall apart and one roll practically fills me up.  It's the size of 2 rolls in most restaurants!  I recommend Sushi in Sushi roll for those who love a bit of spice and tuna."}
{"text":"My wife, my 18 year old son and I had a great dinner at this restaurant on Saturday.  My wife has been going to this restaurant with her colleagues, friends and our son for over 4 years.  She's been raving about this place.  Tonight, I was finally persuaded to try her favourite place as oppose to my favourite restaurants (Fork and Spoon and Spring Rolls).

Well, I was blown away.  The food was tasty and very fresh.  My wife assured me that this is the norm at this establishment.  The Sashimi (fresh raw fish) was so fresh, excellently cut and tasty.  The Sushi was excellent with the perfect amount of rice (not too much) and the fish was fresh.  The assorted Maki was superb; not too much rice, nice white and black sesame seeds and fresh fish.

This is place could easily be featured on the \"Diners, Diners and Dives\".  It's a small place (but not too small), a gem, a clean, well decorated restaurant and felt very authentic.  The restaurant was half full with dine in patrons but the take out was crazy.  The service was good and the price was more than reasonable, considering the quality.

Think I found my new favourite Sushi restaurant.  Of course, my wife let me forget who found it over four years old ;)"}
{"text":"I was around the area and was craving sushi so thought to give this place a try.  Place was in hidden behind 7-11 gas station with plaza with all auto shops.. (Odd..)

I came for lunch at 1:30 and place was half full and was still serving lunch special.  Clean nice ambient w jazz music and good service.

We ordered Salmon teriyaki & tempra Bento box was decent with good size of salmon teriyaki.  However the 10 pcs assorted sushi dish was disapointment. Only had 3-4 types of fish and half of them were salmon sushi.  Spicy salmon roll was small and rice itself didn't hold, it fell apart. I wasn't full after eating it. Lol.  Guess i pay for what I get.."}
{"text":"The best sushi in the area. My co-workers and I come here often. The sushi always tastes fresh and the service is great. I usually get the sushi-sashimi bento or the chirashi."}
{"text":"Sushi in My Stomach more like it.

I haven't had sushi this fresh since I was at Lan sushi. Very delicious. I came here a day ago with my girlfriend. It was family day and we were looking for a sushi place that was open and so we decided to go to Sushi in Sushi since it's close to my home. Upon arrival I noticed a Yelp sticker on their door. . . so I was hoping for a check-in special but unfortunately not, I guess they just love Yelp (who doesn't though?)

The inside looks nice and traditional, and the waitress was friendly. What I love is the fact that they have a buzzer at the table, so no more awkwardly staring at the waitress/waiter and hoping they make eye contact, just push the buzzer instead. I got the Bento-box combo #2. It was delicious but I kept accidentally dipping my sushi in my tempura sauce (amateur mistake). Like I said earlier, the sushi was really fresh, and with big pieces of fish on it. My gf ordered the sushi/sashimi combo and the pieces of sashimi were thick slices. Very delicious. They don't try to cheap out on you which I appreciate. 

Overall our experience was quite pleasant. They were playing light jazz music in the background which created a nice, dare I say romantic, atmosphere. We sat at one of the many booths; however, I would have preferred if the booths had cushioned seats instead of simply chairs. Still, wonderful place. I give it 4.5 stars and recommend it if you are looking for a non all you can eat sushi place in Streetsville Mississauga."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if possible! The rolls were drenched in spicy sauce which dominated the flavour over the seafood. The seafood was stale and tasted super fishy. The rolls were super big and impossible to eat. We couldn't eat more than 2 pieces. 
The service was worst than the food. When we informed the sever that this was the worst sushi we have ever eaten, she offered no apology what so ever and ran away. Our food came after 30 mins and the sever didn't even come back to refill our tea. Avoid this place at all costs!!"}
