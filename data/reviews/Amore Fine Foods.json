{"text":"I catered from Amore Fine Foods for my company lunch meeting and everyone really enjoyed it. They took care into presentation, and the sandwiches were creative and delicious! It was also nice to see a great selection in the desserts compared to the unoriginal cookie you get at most catering companies. Will definitely add Amore as a regular for our future meetings."}
{"text":"The atmosphere leaves something to be desired (at first I wasn't sure if I was walking into the kitchen or the customer area) and there's only one table for eating in. In other words its really a takeout place and caterer and doesn't put on any pretensions. The main point is: the Italian sandwiches are the best I've ever had! They're loaded with veggie toppings and quite reasonably priced. The guys who run the joint are friendly and chatty. I was hoping to pick up some dinner there another day, but they close at 3:00 pm :{  ."}
{"text":"I'd walked by this place for far too long and finally went in. I was skeptical about their \"Voted 5 Stars On Yelp\" sign but I gotta say, they deserve it and here's another.   My lady friend and I split the meatball sandwich and it was flavour country in our mouthes. I can't even tell you what was in it because I blacked out from enjoyment, but it was super delicious and very affordable.  The cherry on the sundae was the two gentlemen that run the joint. They were kind, charming, funny and enjoyable to chat with.   They're only open for a few hours at lunch but I highly recommend. Look forward to trying the rest of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"My only reluctance to writing this post is a fear that Amore will be busy the next time I crave a sandwich.  My girlfriend and I stopped into Amore for the first time for lunch - I ordered the veal parm and my girlfriend had the eggplant parm. They were both exceptional. I live off of sandwiches (some might say for them), and this is my new favorite place.  The veal parm is the most moist veal parm I've had in Toronto. Sauteed veggies and fresh bun were delicious as well. The eggplant parm (which I tried) was awesome too. They use the breaded eggplant as the bun (different breading so it's not soggy or gross to hold), holding in cheese, sauteed veggies, and tasty tomato sauce.  The quality to money ratio at this place is untouched (each of the sandwiches is under $10...). We also enjoyed talking to Michael while we were there. As the above reviews mention, the establishment itself is basic -- one table, a bench with stools, and paper plates. It's personal, comfortable and delicious. I look forward to stopping in again!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING Italian sandwiches. Buns super-soft. They saute the veggies fresh right infront of you. Excellent tomato sauce. I had the bison meatball and it was super-tasty and tender. Guys behind the counter are awesome...chatting, makin wise cracks. Its great! FYI, limited hrs (11am-3pm Mon-Sat) and they now accept debit cards."}
{"text":"I'm about to you the biggest favour. Amore Fine Foods is a catering company located across from the Loblaws on Dupont at the corner of Manning. From Monday-Saturday they serve sandwiches between 11-3. There is one table with two chairs, a bench, and a prep table inside. These are the best sandwiches in Toronto. For sure.  I've had pork schnitzel, bison meatball, and veal. Each one topped with a mix of delicious sauteed vegetables including peppers, spinach, onions, mushrooms, and some other green ones. They taste so good.   The staff there (usually the same two guys) are a barrel of laughs, and it sort of reminds me of the pork store in The Sopranos. Friendly guys who care about making good food. And don't ask if the veal sandwiched is deep fried, you'll probably get slapped in the face (pan fried).   Next time, I'm going to try the eggplant sandwich - which is sort of like a KFC Doubledown because the eggplant is the bread and the veg. toppings are in between.   Prices: About $9 a sandwich...a big sandwich. Extra three bucks for a side of salad or pasta. You better be hungry."}
{"text":"What a great find!   Stopped here out of desperation searching for a quick lunch the other day....omg.    Simple spot.   Italian sandwiches.   Period.  Veal, pork, chicken , meatball, sausage.    Loaded with fresh succulent veggies.   OMG.   One of the best flavour experiences in town.   I am a veal sandwich fanatic so I have sampled almost every one out there.   And these guys take the cake for me.   Not really a place to sit down...better suited to take out.    And the proprietors were just amazing.  Great great guys.   Very real, honest, authentic and nice guys.    I don't get to this area of town often but I will be making the trip just for these sammies now for sure."}
{"text":"I ran into this place by accident - was just walking by, and a place with bison meatballs? Had to try it.  Awesome. Better than California Sandwich (which is good). Better than San Francesco (awful). Had both the veal and bison meatball, and it was great - the meatballs were incredibly soft (almost buttery), and the veal was solid (felt like you were eating some serious meat).  Already thinking of going back."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken sandwich.   The two fellows who run this place made me feel quite welcome while it was made.     They put a lot of care into its creation.   It contained a good portion of fresh yellow peppers.   The chicken was bursting with flavour, and the tomato sauce was portioned perfectly.  I gave this place five stars, but there are three ways it could be even better:     A) offer whole wheat buns to those who avoid white bread carbs  B) accept debit and or credit cards C) extend the business hours"}
{"text":"I stopped by to get a sandwich and they no longer do sandwiches for walk ins - just catering, FYI!"}
{"text":"Had a chicken sandwich ... definite return whenever I am in the area. In fact I will likely take the wife on a Saturday so she can try the veal. This could become a regular lunch spot when shopping downtown."}
{"text":"Was driving by hungry and had noticed their unassuming sign. When I looked up the reviews they were all good!!! So of course I had to make a point of coming.   Hmm well looks like I forgot to post but I've had the pork, veal, eggplant, meatball & chicken. I love that it comes with vegetables  and my favourites so far are the eggplant & meatball though the chicken surprised me as it was moist and not dry. But I'd have to see if they are consistent with it lol. My least favourite was the veal so far. There's still a few more to try though lol   Seriously good deal for $10. And you could easily eat just half and save the rest for later but it would be messy to eat. But if you're a big eater, this place is perfeccto!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the finest veal sandwich in the city. Loaded with tomato, onions, peppers, mushrooms and some greens. Fresher and somehow more 'Italian' tasting than the others (you'll know it when you try it). Don't get me wrong, I love a messy tomato-soaked veal sandwich too, but this was a cut above.   Friendly service, and a nice cozy location."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches! Got the chicken and veal. Friendly owner too. Only gripe is that they have very few hours opened."}
{"text":"We just moved into the area and I noticed Amore as we drove home this week. Looked it up on Yelp and am I ever glad that I did!  As others have said, this is a very unassuming place both inside and out, but the guys are super friendly and welcoming, and the food is fantastic! I ordered the bison meat ball sandwich and it was ridiculously good and very reasonably priced given both the quality and size of the sandwiches.  Given that I work from home, I will definitely be making this a regular lunch stop."}
{"text":"Best veal sandwich in the city hands down. It's far from the typical breaded cutlet soaked in sauce thrown on a bun. This one is a work of art made with passion."}
{"text":"Consistently amazed at the amount of high quality sandwiches around here. In just two reviews most has been said to know what you need to know about this place. To reiterate: you should go. And you should order the veal. Funny thing about Canada, ain't nothing wrong -- if you eat meat -- in ordering veal. I tend to order it at as many places I go to that are like this, and so far this is the one. While Vinny's is just down the block and makes a top notch sandwich (which is cheaper), this Amore thing is special, with peppers as complex as the dynamic between the two men who run this place."}
{"text":"It's Amore!  This unassuming catering venture/sandwich haven made me the best meatball sandwich I have ever had, and I've had a lot.   This place only has one table, and the owners were occupying said table by playing cards there today. I found this terribly cute. They got up, welcomed us warmly and then made us three sandwiches, two meatball and one veal. We took them to goand headed to Chritie Pits. As mentioned above, it was pretty much the best sandwich I've ever had.  As is often the case with truly perfect things, it can't be done proper justice via the written word. Just go taste one and thank me later.   PEPPER POINTS for razzing my pal Kent P. He deserves it."}
