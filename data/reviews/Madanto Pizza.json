{"text":"Great selection of pizzas. A lot of them vegetarian options. I had a slice of spinach and ricotta. The bread was light and fluffy and the spinach ricotta combo was just perfect. 

This is not a place where you go for a nice dinner, but rather pick up a quick bite to eat. And for that, it's just great."}
{"text":"This used to be an Amato pizza location. It's now under a different name and management that likely pays its staff. 

It's got the usual Amato-like pizza and for me that means the vegan options. They even made a vegan version that included things like zucchini and asparagus. It was fantastic, but it never took off.

I worked in the hood for over five years and came here on a regular basis. I will make it a point to have lunch here when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but I saw a cockaroach crawling over one of the pizzas and I walked straight out. At that time it was called Amato's pizza, and now Mandanto...why is there a name change hmmm? I guess Amato decided not to franchise out the name anymore, and if that is the reason, then I can undertand why. Maybe it is better right now, so maybe you can judge for yourself, but just saying....."}
{"text":"I'll swing in here if I'm going to watch a movie with a couple friends who haven't shown up yet and I'm kind of hungry. I really like how you can buy the pizza by the slice and that they have a very wide selection of slices that you can purchase. They do have some really weird choices but I am a big fan of the calabrese and the milano."}
{"text":"now closed."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot when I am in the area and need something quick.  The selection of pizza by the slice is plentiful with unique combinations, and they are quite tasty.  

I have been in here many times with friends or by myself and have never been let down.  They recently(ish) renovated and it looks much less sketchy than it was previously.  Give it a shot!"}
