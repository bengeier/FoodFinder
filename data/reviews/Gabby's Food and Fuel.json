{"text":"I can't believe this is a franchise! It just doesn't have that feeling- more of a local watering hole to be honest.

I came here for the first time last summer with my mom and found their wings to be great. The hot are really hot and I think they made them hotter last night because I asked for suicide but was warned against them....

Obviously I came back last night and a couple of times before on this trip back to Canada. 

I've had the 1/2 price wings with beer and last night we had the nachos and the Poutine, which they graciously allowed us to substitute for regular fries. 

All yummy. 

The service was a little slow last night, especially considering it was a quiet evening. But I'll be back!"}
{"text":"As far as franchise pubs go, Gabby's has no pretention to be a faux-British knock-off.  Gabby's are, if such a thing exists, a Canadian pub.  This one tucked away in the Beach area of Toronto is an intimate, quaint (read \"small\") pub that franchised or not, is a great place to grab a pint, snack, and glance at whatever game is on.

The staff here appears to be indicative to that found franchise-wide.  They are fast, effective, friendly, and will sort you out pretty easily.  The food is standard fare from the franchise, with the wings as always standing out.  The burgers are also good, the bison burger in particular standing out.  My friend and fellow comic lives in this neighbourhood, so on nights where I take the long trek across town on the 504 Queen car, we'll grab a booth, write, and enjoy the wings until the Leafs play.  Then I cheer for their opponents.  Just because I live here, doesn't mean I have to like the teams here.

Plain.  Simple.  Small.  Tasty."}
{"text":"My favorite place for after work drinks, watching the game and having a great steak. People overlook the Striploin on the menu which is fine - more steak for me! The staff is comprised of a small group of true hospitality Rockstars and that's definitely my main reason for always going back. The suicide sauce for the wings is dynamite but it'll melt your face off  - totally worth it though (made in-house too!). I can't say enough good things so I'll stop. Drop by! Have a pint of boneshaker!"}
{"text":"On Canada Day in the late afternoon; a patron was served rotten steak meat.  The patron refused a replacement.  I am so glad I didn't order food here.  The entire place had a sewage-like stench when the dish was brought out and we realized the situation before us.  Disgusting!  The cook had a stupid look on his face, but the waitresses agreed it was completely abnormal.  Quit trying to save costs at the expense of reputation, and a patron's well-being.  I will never go to this franchise again in my life."}
{"text":"Our go to place for wings. Half price Monday's and Wednesday's, good food, great atmosphere, nice \"local pub\" feel. Dave the server/bartender is fantastic (and great for a leafs conversation! ) We've been frequenting bars and pubs in the beaches for many years and Gabbys has earned a spot on the favorites list."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the price to be expected, but the servings a little on the skimpy side. I ordered loaded potato skins, craft city burger and yankee burger through UberEats. The restaurant should work on their descriptions (and pictures!) of the food. While the skins are great, there were only three. Three in a \"share plate\" that runs $10. That's 1 1/2 for each of us. Not what we were expecting. The picture shows six. At least spring for four....really? 

I can't speak for my daughter's burger, but mine (craft city) tastes great. I just wish it had \"onion rings\" as the description states rather than onion ring. 

It's a nice little treat, but I'll likely order from a place where the servings are a bit more generous (and accurate) next time...like GBK. I get that the food rarely looks like the picture, but I expect this from a fast food joint, not a place like this. Maybe the experience would be better at the actual restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good place to get decent priced pub and to watch the game (although its a little hockey crazy), Gabby's is the place to be. I've been to a bunch of locations through out Toronto and I haven't every been disappointed (although there is no major WOW factor). The staff was also very pleasant and Monday and Wednesday are wing night....so that is always a blast."}
