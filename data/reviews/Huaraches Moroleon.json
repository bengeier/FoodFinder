{"text":"We ate there last night.  Noticed the outside looks inviting.  Nice comfortable booths and tables inside.  It's small but that's what so charming about the place.  The option of 3 sauces with your chips is totally amazing.  I tried them all and ended up mixing them.  I just wonder what happens to them after people are done???  are they recycled???  The waiter was attentative and the food was very flavorful, too. Very large soft drinks.   Hand made items.  I think it cost a little over $20 for two adults."}
{"text":"This place is small, and poorly located, but its a GEM. Cheap, well prepared food, delicious frozen margs, attentive staff, and an environment that is reminiscent of a mother's kitchen. I am so happy that I found this place, as I intend to take everybody that comes to Champaign Urbana to this location. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Huaraches offers a large variety of entrees and is extremely tasty for the price. This is definitely one of the top mexican restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area, along with Maize. They give HUGE horchatas and I would definitely recommend getting one!  My only complaint is that it takes WAY too long to get your bill at the end of the meal. I can confirm this because I've eaten here multiple times. There is only one waiter who serves for an entire restaurant that's always packed, so be prepared to wait just as long as you did to get a seat to wait for your receipt. Dinner lengths here are double what they would be anywhere else simply because of this understaffing issue."}
{"text":"I went there last night and ordered a steak ranchero for 9.99. It tasted OK, but I think it is a bit over price. The chip is a bit greasy. I am not a big fan of Mexican food, so I will give it a 3 star."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood joint. Family owned and they are always very friendly, attentive and clean. Their tacos are some of the best Mexican I've had in the Midwest. I go there at least 1-2x per week.  Go check them out!"}
{"text":"Thought it doesn't look great on the outside, Huaraches Moroleon is cozy and charming inside, with friendly staff and authentic smells and tastes. I ordered a huarache, carry-out, which I have never tried before. It was a corn-based shell containing steak, cheese, lettuce, tomato, cilantro, and pineapple (!), if memory serves me correctly. The sweetness of pineapple in this fried concoction added a really nice touch. Some places place too much meat on the food, others have too many toppings, or use too much oil. The huarache was a bit on the greasy side, but overall it was balanced. The sauces they provided, too, tasted homemade, and I didn't remember how unique they were until I saw some of the other reviews here.   I was quite pleased with the meal, and would definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"After having multiple bad experiences with other local Mexican restaurants a friend recommended this to us. It was fabulous! Small and quaint, you really get the feeling of being at home. They bring you 4 different salsas which is a plus in my book, also the serving sizes are HUGE plenty to take home. Also loved that they added grilled pineapple to the fajitas! The best part about the food is that it came out fresh & not pre made like most typical Mexican restaurants. Will most definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"It's not bad. The highlight of Huaraches Moreleon (and what keeps us coming back more than anything else) is definitely their homemade chips and the three sauces they bring out with them. Molto bene! I mean, muy bueno! Whatever. They're pretty good.  The best entree they make is the Aver Si Puede (\"See if You Can\"), which is basically a gigantic plate of meat with some rice and beans thrown in the middle in case you were in need of inferior sources of protein to feel like you're eating Mexican food. It feeds two large people or a small family of small people.   Their basic enchilada sauce is not much more than watered-down tomato sauce. The mole sauce is ok. The chipotle sauce on the Enchiladas Suizas is probably the best I've had thus far. Still, even the worst enchiladas are pretty decent.  I like the breakfast skillets.   Don't order soup.  I have not had good experiences with their more \"exotic\" offerings such as tripas or lengua tacos. Either the chef does not know how to make them, or the ingredients are poor. Superior tripas tacos can be found on literally any taco truck operating in the area between Santa Monica and Houston, TX. Go to Huaraches, but avoid these menu items.  Oh, the prices are reasonable, and the service is typically fast unless you order the more \"exotic\" offerings I mentioned.  The food is great for the area, but it still doesn't hold a candle to most Mexican food in the Southwest. For that I have to give it four out of five stars. But you should still go. This is a small, fledgling place, and it deserves your custom."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and, although I want to love it, have never been as impressed as the reviews here would suggest. Here are a few of my impressions:  Pros:  You can't beat the price. Prompt seating is usually available. The chips and salsa are pretty awesome  Cons:   I've not found any items on the menu to be better than good (I can remember having the Huaraches, Burritos, Fajitas, and Tacos). I find the beans to be fairly bland and that the tortillas are often a bit gummy. Also, the margaritas are far too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"I think I am being generous with 2 stars. Perhaps because I've lived in the west...but this Mexican food sucks. Margarita tasted so awful. They would of been better off serving a mix. Ordered carne asada tacos. Meat had zero seasoning. Other diners ordered California burrito (was boring, lacked flavor) the other ordered chicken enchiladas (plain). Oh, almost forgot the salsa's. 4 on the table. 1st was tomato sauce. 2nd was green tomato. 3rd was like a buffalo sauce. 4th a hotter version of the sauce. Not what I call salsa. The homemade chips are grease with a side of tortilla."}
{"text":"YES. Better than all the other Mexican places I've been in CU. I got the Lengua Ranchero and a lot of restaurants have a hard time getting the beef tongue right. But this place mastered it. The horchata is legit, tastes real with real cinnamon. I'd come here again for sure."}
{"text":"Impressed. Didn't know what to expect from the outside, small quaint little \"Mexican\" restaurant.  They had horchata and tamarindo, Mexican drink's that most restaurants around here so not have.  Very tasty. I ordered the gorditas that came with handmade tortillas, and they were handmade.  My mom used to make handmade tortillas growing up so I know.  My mom had a dish she was very satisfied with.  Very large portions.  Good service."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a bad review, because the first time I went, it was delicious! The guacamole is great and the service is friendly. However, the last time I went it was so terrible that I don't think I'll be going back again. The server informed me that it was $1 tacos, so obviously that's a deal, but they were so bad that I couldn't even eat them. I got three different kinds, all of which tasted like burnt, old meat, topped with slimy cilantro and onion-- no tomato, lettuce, cheese, or sour cream-- which was confusing to me, since my friend had ordered hard tacos and had gotten the listed toppings. Her hard shells tasted stale! I filled up on tons of guacamole and chips and salsa, but I feel like their food quality has gone down since opening."}
{"text":"Huaraches Moroleon is a neighborhood treasure!  We love the food, the family atmosphere, and the great service.  Highest recommendation goes for the regional dishes - particularly the Huaraches (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huarache_(food)) from Moroleon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morole%C3%B3n)!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is fresh and delicious, service is fast and friendly, and prices are low. Inside is small, clean, and cheerful, and there's an outside table that seat six or eight. You get free chips and four kinds of salsa with every meal. We've had the tacos (chicken, alpastor, chorizo, and carnitas), burritos (choriza, chicken, and alpastor) and huaraches (vegetarian and chicken) -- all fantastic. Extra points for being right around the corner from our house -- good fresh food within easy walking distance!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is delicious and a great deal for the price. Definitely the best Mexican food in Champaign-Urbana. They also serve breakfast until noon. Delicious food with great people!"}
{"text":"I am sad to see Fin-n-feather go, which was the previous restaurant at  this location.  They had my favorite fried fish in town..  But I decided to make the best of it and try the new place.  I've now been twice, very pleased each time.  My girlfriend and I have tried the carnitas huarache, a torta alpastor special, the tongue tacos, and the carnitas burrito.  They've all been great.  Fresh vegetables and flavorful, tender meat.  The huarache came with a grilled pineapple to put on it.  I was a little skeptical but it was delicious.  Everything comes with cilantro and onion, and most come with lettuce and tomato.  Our take-out meals came with a bag of fresh fried chips and three little plastic containers of sauce - one salsa verde, one fruity salsa, and one more spicy orange salsa.  They were all excellent.  (The second time we went, the chips were a little more greasy, but they had definitely been recently fried.)  They're fast on take-out, and if they stay this good, it may be hard to eat in at one of the tables.  My only complaint is that they do not have horchata at the moment.  My two favorite places for Mexican in town now are Mas Amigos and this place - and both are excellent.  The prices on most entrees is around $6-7 - which is actually comparable to what it costs to get enough fast food to fill us up.  Between Chipotle, Taco Bell, or here, the choice is clear."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Mexican food in the area! Maize is very good as well, but I personally find Huaraches Moroleon to have more flavorful dishes and variety. I recommend the Big Burra if you like pineapple, it's a lot of food but it's honestly like no other quesadilla I've ever had. Oh, and definitely try the salsas.   Although the exterior may be slightly off putting (it's small and appears slightly rundown from the outside), the food and the trip out to Urbana (if you live on campus like I do) is totally worth it if you like Mexican food!"}
{"text":"The carnitas huaraches were excellent....different for me, but I enjoy new foods. The chips that came with the salsas were too oily for my taste. Margarita was strong and flavorful. Will be back to try other menu items. Worth having your phone handy to search any food terms you may be unfamiliar with......"}
{"text":"If it's Friday I will remember it's taco night. Love their Lengua taco. The chips are good as they come with a variety of sauce. Area is kind of small, but it works for me and we usually order to go."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant in Urbana, for sure. Sorry Maize, pero perdiste el alma que tenías. The salsas are what makes this place special. The first is an orange-colored creamy chipotle salsa, the second is a green creamy salsa made with tomatillos and avocado, and the last one is a light, traditional red salsa. Let me let you in on a little secret. Ask for your tacos made with asada AND chorizo mixed together. You'll never have a better taco mix than this.. The al pastor is a little too greasy for my taste. And get your tacos with cilantro and onion. None of that lettuce cheese tomato please!  Update: 2016, wow, what a booming business this has turned into. I'm so proud of the family who owns this place for their success. Every time I come in it's PACKED!"}
{"text":"The best service, every time.  Great food, and a cool little place in a nice neighborhood location, far from any other restaurants or shopping areas.  I crave my fave dish from here too often.  The cactus plate is great. They've perfected the burrito, and the huarache, among other things.  Tips: There is a secret vegetarian menu you have to ask for specifically.  The \"green burrito\" costs extra than a regular burrito, but you can get the same results by ordering a regular burrito and pouring the complimentary green salsa over it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner recently, and I was happy with my experience. The staff is friendly and attentive, and you're provided with a free basket of chips and salsas (3 types, all spicy) when you're seated. Between the chips and the two tacos I ordered (at $1.90 each), I was full. The chips are filling, so be prepared to take home leftovers if you order a big entree. The al pastor was a good balance of fat and meat, and the carnitas was a bit dry but still tasty. I also ordered a glass of horchata (not on the menu), and thought it was perfectly spiced and milky."}
{"text":"I had a carne asada huarache. The meat was very nicely seasoned, and the chopped tomato was notably ripe. The salsas here are fantastic, three different kinds each with a unique character. We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"A bit out of the way but extremely accommodating for vegetarian options. All the plates we carried out tasted great. A bit repetitive with the same toppings and nothing surprising out of ordinary for creative combos."}
{"text":"Pros: delicious food. 4 salsa options with your chips. He chips are fresh and yummy. The menu had lots of choices. The enchiladas are yummy! The Diabla enchiladas are super spicy- but with a good fire taste. Our wait staff has always been super friendly. Outside seating as well.   Cons: it's small and hot inside. There is sometimes a bit of a wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Al pastor and carnita tacos are great! I'm a big fan of the complementary chipotle salsal!"}
{"text":"I hear that the food is pretty good, but I didn't even have the opportunity to try it. Waited in their \"lobby\" and by the kitchen door (only place to stand) for almost 15 minutes, and wasn't even greeted. The one customer in front of me was later greeted and order taken, shortly before I  walked out. (I can only imagine how long they waited) I was only needing to make a to-go order, so their extremely limited seating did not matter.  While I was there... A few tables were cleared, food was brought out, and drinks refilled drinks. Still, no acknowledgement by staff.   Most Mexican restaurants that I have visited have had stellar service and speed. You're greeted right away, and if you need to make a to-go order, it is taken care of right away. Knowing that at least three different employees walked past me multiple times without a greeting... I will not be returning to this restaurant. Maize  & Dos Reales provide quality service and great food... And they will continue to receive my business and praise.   Thank you for reading."}
{"text":"Maize is great and all, but don't be fooled. Huaraches Moreleon is the best Mexican restaurant in Champaign. Service is great and the food is even better."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch today. Ordered a bunch of food. Mole chicken enchiladas (4per order) and a spicy burrito. Awesome and awesome! Enough said. I'll try the dish that they are named after during my next visit.  Yum and Yum."}
{"text":"Yummy! We didn't know what to expect when we pulled up at this little, tiny, yellow place but it surprised us (in a positive way!)! First time we had huaraches and we absolutely loved them. The owner/cashier was really speedy and promptly delivered our food. Only weird thing was that the Sangria actually wasn't sangria (it was non-alcoholic). The three different salsas were fun."}
{"text":"Okay, this is a storefront type restaurant, so the tacky décor can be forgiven.  What can't be forgiven is the filth.  The dining area is smaller than my living room which means there is no excuse for not keeping it clean.  The ceiling fans were caked with dust and grit as were many of the surfaces.  The floor was filthy.  Come on, guys, that place could be cleaned daily in less than 15 minutes. If the public area is that way, one can imagine what is in the kitchen.  I took my food home, opened the box, was craving Mexican food, but could not get myself to eat any of it, thinking of the general filth of the dining area and its implications for the kitchen.  I like seeing little places like this succeed, so I hope that someone decides to start cleaning this place on a regular basis.  No one likes clumps of dust dropping into their food from a neglected ceiling fan or wondering what the hygiene is in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place to get Mexican food in Champaign-Urbana. I love their outside patio in the summer. It usually isn't very crowded when I go which I very much enjoy. They give you 4 different types of salsas when they bring out chips which I think is such an added bonus. I always get their steak tacos and a margarita. I always leave satisfied and I will continue to return."}
{"text":"The food here was definitely on point. I ordered the fish taco dinner and they were some of the best fish tacos I have had. They also had a wide variety of Jarritos flavors, including grapefruit. The outdoor seating is a little bit close to the street, but it is a relatively quiet street. The wait staff was also extremely attentive and refilled waters and got us more tortilla chips. Also the salsas were delicious. Wish it was closer to campus, because I would go all the time!"}
{"text":"YUM!!  My son recommended we eat here the day we drove him back to U of I after his spring break.  Fantastic choice!!!!  The homemade chips and homemade salsas were amazing.  And my steak chimichanga was delicious.  The best part....the white cheese sauce it was drowning in.  SO good!!  I would have preferred a little more steak inside, and less rice, but it was fresh and awesome, and I left fat and happy.  Our waiter was extremely attentive, and keep calling us his amigos.  Great service.   It doesn't look like much on the outside, but it's definitely one of those diamonds in the rough. Check it out if you love fresh, authentic Mexican food.  (Although, I don't think chimichangas are authentic Mexican!)"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place for some authentic hispanic food in Champaign, IL. The place is decorated in typical mexican style. They have nice and clean facility with cramped up sitting. Not much privacy for couples but who cares when the food is so good.   Try anything on the menu and you will not be disappointed. They have sandwiches as well. All of the food is prepared from fresh ingredients and that makes it delicious. I don't know about authenticity of the taste but this definitely tingles my taste buds. I would be a regular here for a nice lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Good quality American Mexican food. I would go back if I'm passing by, but wouldn't make a special trip to go here.  The good: flavorful if you're looking for the kind of Mexican food that uses sour cream The not so good: small, no waiting space The unsure: huge portions"}
{"text":"Been there, loved it! All food we ordered was great, prices are quite low. Parking is limited but you can park on Philo St for free. Seating is also limited and it was packed when we came, but its still larger than Maize."}
{"text":"Wow- DO NOT miss this one. I've had mexican food all over the southwestern US- including Arizona and southern california- and I would consider it to be truly special. Proud to have a such a genuine eatery as part of the local community! Good people, fantastic food, and now they have mexican beers, including the red label Bohemia. What a breath of fresh air!"}
{"text":"We walked in and it was freezing, so we sat down 15 mins later they took our order. We then asked if we could sit outside and the waitress said if you want but there's a lot of flies out there.   We ordered huaraches of nopales which was actually a quesadilla with nopales from a jar. My daughter ordered steak tacos which were bland and cold. My sister ordered a dish that had chicken, steak and shrimp. She said it was \"ok\". My mom ordered sopes of pastor and also were \"ok\"  I ordered a cantarito which came in a copper mug with a regular stare and not in the clay based jar with a straw covered in chile.   The waitress was right about the flies...about 30 at our table alone.  I do have to say the salsas were really good. Probably won't come back which is disappointing since everyone gave it good reviews.   Back to Maize"}
{"text":"I usually never write reviews unless I am in amazement. The food here is one of the top 10 amongst all Mexican restaurants I have ever eaten at, in and around the country That should speak volumes. Nothing else needs to said"}
{"text":"Service was fine, food tasted fine, prices were cheap. Was not a fan of the rice having peas and carrots in it... I expect that at a Chinese restaurant but can't stand it in a chimichanga. Also, as I was finishing my meal, I saw a cockroach crawl out of a crack in the wall and then crawl back in. NOPE CYA."}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic. Very small but with wait staff and tables to sit down and eat. Friendly and accommodating. We go different things and asked for all sorts of additions or substitutions and all of it was great."}
{"text":"Excellent food -- probably the best mexican restaurant in the area. This place is not a tex-mex place and so you won't find greasy refried beans and cheese, and sour cream.   Their huaraches are amazing and they have this cactus dish (name escapes me) which is also fantastic and quite healthy. They always 4-5 different kinds of salsas which change every time I visit.  On top of that, this place is very cheap."}
{"text":"My first ever yelp review and it has to go to Huaraches Moroleon! I love this place so much! Not only my favorite Mexican spot, but one of my top 5 favorite Urbana restaurants. -Staff is friendly and accommodating -The chips are so fresh and crispy and delicious -They have a separate VEGETARIAN MENU!!! I've been to lots of Mexican restaurants and have never seen that. It has some delicious unique options like CACTUS fajitas and a nice fresh salad with pineapple chunks, cactus, veggies, pico de gallo, and beans -I always skip the cheese and sour cream to make stuff VEGAN and let me tell you, with all of the fresh flavors, I don't miss the dairy at all! -The sauces! Oh my, they bring out 3 bottles of house-made sauces to the table with the chips, and those sauces.....the green is my favorite and the smoky red comes in a close second!!! -The guacamole is fresh and just as yummy as guac can be -Also it's always an awesome value -Did I mention they have a full breakfast menu too??! -I could go on and on but I will stop now. Can't wait til my next visit!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good! My favorite place to eat now. They do carry out too. Steak tacos amazing. Chips and salsa amazing."}
{"text":"Dear sweet baby Jeebus. Menudo! Pozole! Tamales! Huaraches! Margaritas! Everything is amazing--don't be afraid to venture out of your tostado or burrito box--you'll be thanking yourself later. Man waiter eye candy isn't so bad either..."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. Coming from Texas, the CU Mexican food scene was a pretty disappointing.   Huaraches is some of the BEST we've ever had. EVER.   Also, they serve Mexican breakfast.... Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Best salsas. Best place to get a huarache in town... WAIT, the ONLY place I know where you can get a huarache in C-U! Nothing fancy but the best Mexican food I've eaten in the States have been at swap meets, so what do I know?"}
{"text":"I have tried several items from the menu and everything has been excellent. Mexican Restaurants can be hit or miss sometimes with the quality of food, but this place does not seem to have that problem. Unlike other places in town, I believe this restaurant cooks your meal to order- the chicken is juicy and the veggies are very fresh. They make soup and salsas daily and possibly even the tortillas- which are soft and warm.  This place is quite small, so I would recommend trying to avoid peak hours if you don't have time to wait."}
{"text":"My family eats here roughly once a week. We love the chicken tacos. It is easily the best Mexican restaurant in the Champaign/Urbana area. The staff is friendly and the food comes out fast. They even have a really good breakfast menu. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Their salsas are incredible.  The chips are good and aren't your standard Mexican restaurant fare.  They are a bit oily, so that may turn some people off, but I like them.  For the main course, I usually get the Fajita Quesadilla and it is much better than the one at El Toro or Dos Reales.  The have a kids menu and our girls like the tacos.  The service is usually rather spotty, which is really the only downside here."}
{"text":"Today was my first trip to Huaraches Moroleon having been inspired by all the positive reviews on Yelp. It's a small place and parking when it's busy can be a problem, but has been stated in other reviews, there is on-street parking.   It was around noon when I went but was seated quickly. The chips and the four types of salsas were soon brought out and they were all delicious! It was hard to fight the temptation to finish off a basket by myself. I ordered a huarache with barbacoa and a steak taco w/cilantro and onion. After less of a wait than I anticipated the food was brought out. The taco was packed full of meat and was excellent. I had never ordered a huarache before and was surprised how huge it was. It also was packed full (one thing to say, you will not cheated when it comes to portion size) with tender, flavorful barbacoa. If I had been prudent, I would have only eaten half and taken the rest with me, but it was too good!  In short, I heartily endorse this restaurant and will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"Not the slightest bit authentic. I lived a 45 minute drive from Mexico in an area where the population is more than 50% Mexican for 6 years, and became very familiar with authentic Mexican cuisine. Living that close to Mexico, I visited the country and ate in Mexico dozens of times. This restaurant is as Americanized as it gets.   The seasonings, cheese, beans, and rice were all wrong.   It's nothing like real Mexican food. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is perfect. Great food, atmosphere, service, prices, portions. You get amazing salsa and homemade chips free at the beginning of your meal. My friend and I both got fajitas, and we are speechless. Great mix of creative flavor, and really enough to feed two people or take home the other half for later. I would come here all the time if I lived here; I want to try everything."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are awesome.  Very good food.  Not your average American Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path Mexican. When the basket of chips came out there were three sauces to choose from and a salsa.  I had the house special. Huaraches, I believe, with al pastor, that would be the grilled pork and it was good.  I liked the grilled pineapple garnish."}
{"text":"What a happy place ! perhaps the best Mexican restaurant in town, and a true gem.  Simple, clean, well seasoned food, and overall delicious. I usually get Burrito Enmolado or one of the Fajitas. Pair that with a good Mexican beer (or the fantastic Horchata), and you're all set. On top of your main dish, you'll get  four excellent salsas (my favorite is the smoky-spicy one) and fried tortilla for snacking, so you'll never leave the place hungry."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Mexican in a very off-the-beaten-path place in Urbana. Very deep and authentic Mexican menu. Started with 4 carafes of salsa with home-made chips. I ordered Huevos Con Chorizo and got at least 5 or 6 fresh home-made flour tortillas (huge win as almost no place I have ever been brings more than 3).   Food, service and everything was great. Only my first visit and just lunch, but this place is a local favorite, so come early and often!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in CU. Homemade chips and I believe 3 different salsas to start each meal. All the dishes are flavorful and generous portions. It's a small building with limited seating so get there early if you're going on a weekend."}
{"text":"Great food and portion sizes. I will start out by saying I'm not really a big fan of Mexican food, but this place really impressed me. I was not really expecting anything too great when I walked in because of the small size of the restaurant. I was seated quickly and given tortilla chips with a variety of sauces. The chips were way better than the cheap packaged stuff you find at grocery stores. I liked the dark red spicy sauce.   I ordered the Fajita Loca with ham, steak and bacon. I was pleasantly surprised by the ample portion and fresh meats and rice offered. The steak was flavorful and not too chewy unlike cheap \"mock meats\". Although I don't really like bell peppers, they were pretty good, and I finished all of them on my dish.   The service is great with friendly and prompt staff, My order was taken quickly and I did not have to wait a long time to be served. One minor thing is that you don't get a spoon with your standard fork and knife. I did not really mind this, but you can probably ask to get a spoon if you really wanted one. Although some people say the place is too hot, I did not find it a problem when I went on July 3rd 2015(76 degrees F)   Would definitely go again- 5 stars for the great food and reasonable prices. Here is a pdf of their menu because I could not find it anywhere online: bit.ly/Huaraches-Moroleon-Menu (Hit the x button when Dropbox tells you to sign up)"}
{"text":"Super yummy spicy burrito couldn't resist plenty of flavor and sauces to pick from staff were super attentive great ice tea fresh would come back anytime and would recommend to all ..."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path and as authentic as it gets! As a veteran road warrior this was a great find. Liked it so much made a return visit the next evening with a group of coworkers. The Carnitas are the real deal! Crispy and juicy not dried out like some places."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! Loved their selection of homemade salsas. Wonderful service, great prices."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed the fajitas with chicken, steak, and ham - delicious!  Can't believe we haven't eaten here sooner!  Easily the best Mexican food in the area - good flavor - solid - fresh - delicious.  Good sized portions.  Spicy FRESH salsa and FRESH fried tortilla chips.  The margaritas are excellent - wow! - one of the best margaritas in champaign and we like top shelf margaritas...  Don't judge the restaurant from the street!  Parking is sparse and seating is limited but the food and drinks are excellent!  Good service - fast kitchen.    Hoping they open up a second location with an outdoor seating area - I'm picturing sitting outside in the sun with a pitcher of their delicious margaritas or a bucket of modelos on ice enjoying a skillet of fajitas!"}
{"text":"We had really great food from this restaurant. The Barito's were filled with white meat chicken and the spaces were excellent."}
{"text":"The carnitas are the best I have ever had.  This is some seriously tender and perfectly slow cooked pork.  It was crispy in some parts, soft in others and downright flavorful all around!  My only question is why can't any of the Mexican restaurants in the Chicago area make food half as tasty as these guys?  I can't drive out to Urbana every weekend..."}
{"text":"i love the food its really well rounded. drinks are perfect. salsas are f@qin killer! used to go a lot more before it got over crowded with douchey hipsters."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, oh my goodness!  This place is fabulous!  This location has had a lot of restaurants occupy it, but this Mexican restaurant is to die for!  I was the only one there.... They had a few specials on the board and I saw fish tacos (3) for $5.99.  I ordered those and a mexican coke.  I sat down at one of the nice booths (restaurant easily seats 30+) and the nice waitress brought out a generous portion of chips and four salsas.  There was a mild, spicy, green and another medium/mild.  The chips were warm and crunchy.  Almost finished the basket!  The fish tacos came out soon after and they were great!  The fish was lightly breaded and fried.... I wish they were grilled, but I didn't ask.... There was a generous mound of onions, cilantro, cabbage and a mayonaise based drizzle on top!  They were great!  I also got a mexican coke.... It came out warm, but drinking warm coke reminds me of my grandparents...they used to serve us warm coke so it was nostalgic for me.... I bet it would bother a lot of other people.... But anyways, the bill came out to about $8.60.   Not bad!   I would say that this place would give Maize a run for its money.... They have a lot more seating and the food is just as good if not better.  Too bad it's waaay out in Urbana...They're also open for breakfast....  I will definitely be back to try some other things!!  I hope they don't fall suit to the prior restaurants at this location....that would be a terrible loss."}
{"text":"Small place but excellent food. I live in Mahomet and generally don't come to this part of Urbana, but I will make a trip to go here."}
{"text":"If Maize didn't exist, this place would be a godsend. But it does, so Huaraches Moroleon is just okay. If you want to wait, but not Maize wait, go here."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place out on 4/27 and I'll say Ken R's. review is about right. Mas Amigos is our go to Mexican place the food here is of the same quality. The place is very small 5 or 6 tables. Our feeling about this place is if your doing dinner get it to go if for no other reason then the terrible lack of a margarita, they do not have a liquor license may not want the liabilities that come with that, but for a quick lunch sit and have a taco or two. One thing that needs a lot of help is the menu, english would be a good place to start and there are no appetizers or sides on the menu we had to ask if they had guacamole. They do and its very good, you think you might want that on the menu? So as four stars says yay I'm a fan, it just needs a little work the food is great the price is right and they are fast. So the feel of the place is fast food joint think Taco Bell with great food."}
{"text":"All around, one of the greatest neighborhood restaurants in the east Urbana area. Right when you get seated, you receive a basket of (often warm!) house made tortilla chips with 4 salsa ranging from mild to spicy. The salsas are one of the main draws for us as they are truly the best you can get at any Mexican restaurant in town. We also love the margaritas as they are delicious and quite strong! Our usual order consists of queso w/chorizo, fresh guacamole, and individual tacos on corn tortillas w/limes, onion and cilantro. Definitely ask for tacos made this way as many people likely default to ordering the flour tortillas/lettuce/shredded cheese  (American) style tacos and they just aren't the same! The outdoor patio seating is lovely when the weather is good."}
{"text":"After a few really tasty tacos (the lengua is pretty good) the hunger is quelled so I can leave a fair review. The food is very good and the people are courteous, they deserve five stars."}
{"text":"It took me a long time to stop by this place, but now that I live a block away, I'm there all the time! Great drink selection, and their margaritas aren't too sweet or too sour - just right.  Their fish taco's are freakin' amazing. The only thing I have against this place is that all their salsas are spicy (and I'm a weakling when it comes to spice). But! They are redeemed by their queso dip - top of it's class. You'll see me here all the time - moreso once they put out their patio seating!"}
{"text":"I used to live up the street when this building housed Sweet Betsy's, then Skully's, then Fin-N-Feather. Since we've moved I haven't had occasion to drive by very frequently, but I was pleased to see a new place here that finally looked like it might have a chance to stay. I've been eyeing it for a while, and finally happened to be by today at lunch and stopped in. I am so glad I did, and I'll be finding a reason to head over that direction again soon.  The carnitas huarache was fantastic. Really flavorful carnitas:  juicy and tender with a great char outside. The huarache itself was tasty, and the cheese was great too - not that plastic stuff you get most places. It came with a little bag of perfectly fried, thin and crispy chips and 3 salsas that ranged from fruity to spicy. I wasn't a huge fan of any of the salsas in all honesty, but the huarache more than made up for it.  There are 3 tables that seat 4 and a couple of tables for 2, plus some counter seating. I don't think that building has ever been so sparkling and clean, even way back when it was Sweet Betsy's years ago. They obviously did a lot of work in there. The service was quick and friendly too."}
{"text":"I grew up in California and severely miss the Mexican food I grew up with. I've been searching high and low for good restaurant in Danville or Chambana areas and this was the best place I found! Finally, I can satisfy my craving for a good burrito! I always enjoy eating here and always leave being so stuffed I can barely get to my car. It's glorious... I always find something good to eat here and I am vegetarian, which works just great. I often get a California or spicy burrito with grilled vegetables (you have to make sure to tell them to put that because they don't list the veggies in the menu as an option). The coconut margarita I had was honestly not very good, but there's plenty other good things to drink here instead. The service is always good, the people are always nice, and there's enough parking at the times that I've gone. I highly recommend eating here and will keep coming back many times in the future."}
{"text":"Although the menu was a nice change from the average Mexican restaurant, the food was all greasy to the point it was inedible. Chips? Ridiculously greasy. Steak taco...the steak was grisly and greasy. Chorizo was greasy and bland. I had such high hopes for this place. In the future I'll stick with Maize."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Great menu with a huge selection. Things tasted fresh. Servings were plentiful. And the interior was homey and welcoming."}
{"text":"Huaraches is one of the best spots for Mexican food in Champaign/Urbana. The building is easy to find, although parking can get tricky. They have fresh chips and you get 4 different varieties of salsas and mixing cups to create your own blend. GENIUS! The margaritas are spot on and always perfect. Same with the food. I've never ordered a dish that wasn't drool worthy. The service has always been spectacular, even when our group may have been a little rowdy after a late night out."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Mexican!! The Steak Supreme soft tacos are the best and also enjoy the chicken tortilla soup!! Limited seating and parking but its worth the hassle!!"}
{"text":"Located in an unsuspecting neighborhood in Urbana is Huaraches Moroleon. As I drove through the neighborhood I thought I must be lost; there are houses everywhere, but nope Siri was correct and there was Huaraches.  Now this place was packed for a Tuesday night, and though the parking lot was full there was ample amounts of street parking. When my party and I went inside we waited with three other families about 4 minutes before we were seated. I felt as though a lot of the seating was crammed together and so were the tables. Claustrophobes beware, it's a tight space.  I ordered the carne asada taco meal and my party had the carne asada burrito con todo and horchatas. As we waited on our food we were presented with their yummy chips and four varieties of salsa; one had a chipotle southwestern flavor, another was a hot red salsa, pico de gallo as well as a green pickled flavored salsa. The horchatas were spot on delicious and my carne steak tacos were pretty flavorful- I go pico and guac all the time. The meat was very flavorful and my taco never once cracked- not sure if it was because they were devoured before they could've but either way they're taco shells were spot on.  I also noticed a table of people ordering margaritas which I heard they're famous for, and there were lots of drinks at happy hour prices all day- if you're looking for the land of 24 happy hours Huaraches Moroleon is it. Though the seating was tight, my company and I enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and it's slowly becoming top 3 favorite Mexican spots. 4 different salsas come to your table when you first get there, all 4 are great my personal favorite is the green (jalapeño). The tacos are phenomenal, traditional Mexican tacos simply made in a soft tortilla with choice of meat, onions and cilantro. Chimichangas are definitely worth a try as well! Quaint place inside, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This will be a simple easy review, great service, great prices, very good food, best chips in Illinois, 4 great salsas to try all good. Very unexpected cause it's nowhere near anything else. But it was all good"}
{"text":"My first time eating here, now I see what all the hype is about! Best horchata and am thinking about ending my long time relationship with my old favorite Mexican restaurant and eloping with huaraches  I am a food lover, especially mexican food and this food was seriously amazing."}
{"text":"This food made my wig fly off. Great service especially from Wilfrido. Delicious food and would highly recommend the Sopapillas for dessert, some of the best I've ever had. Would absolutely come here again."}
{"text":"A truly delicious burst of authentic Mexican cuisine. I had been searching for an authentic Mexican joint in CU and this is the place.   What I liked: The food was fresh, delicious, and portions were generous.  What I didn't like: It was a little warm inside. The margarita was mucho expensivo. The total bill for 2 people was 35 dollars. More than I would normally pay for Mexican food but because the quality was so amazing I will have to come back to this place."}
{"text":"Like any other generous mexican restaurant they had unlimited chips but here you get 4 different types of dips.  I particularly loved the jalapeno dip (the light green colored dip), which had the right amount of spice to my liking. I got a mango flavored margarita which comes in three different sizes.  You could choose to get a medium/large margarita and share it as the glass would be big enough for 2.  For main course, I got the Fajita loca which comes with 3 choices of meat for which i got Chorizo, Steak and Chicken. The chorizo was good but combined with the other 2 meats, rice,  tortilla and beans it can be quite filling. The beans were a bit sloppy but the meats made up for it.   Overall the platter was good, but i would place the pricing a touch above single $ pricing."}
{"text":"Great mexican resturant in middle if nowhere! I like their fajitas! Also their lingua is really good."}
{"text":"First visit. I've been wanting to stop in, but it is in an East or central Urbana location. The atmosphere is authentic and clean. No other Mexican food restaurant in C-U has the breakfast menu that Huaraches Moreleon has. I tried their Burrito Bandido. It was excellent and the potatoes that went with it were perfect and not greasy. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town.  I highly recommend bringing friends, family, or just yourself there.  The food is so fresh, and the staff are wonderful.  Parking a little difficult at times,  but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"So I walk in and the first server I see speaks to me in Spanish and you can tell his English is not so good  - JACK POT! (also I have been told I look Mexican)   The place was cute, and the prices were good.There is a nice selection of Salsa. All in all good food (big portions, but that's how I feel in any restaurant I got to in America) and good prices. They have a good selection and I have to say  I prefer this place to El Maiz in UC.  The Horchata was really good however the only thing I didn't like was the Corn tortillas they brought; each tortilla was dipping with oil (not exaggerating) we couldn't eat them.   They crank the AC pretty high up in here so maybe bring a light sweater - no joke- I was freezing my culo off!"}
{"text":"Huaraches is the best kept secret of the Urbana area.   Expect to wait, because seating is limited, but the food here is phenomenal.  Most taco's are around $2.50 and two is more than enough. The food is so fresh and well done, it's as authentic as it gets.   This mom and pop shop boasts 4 different salsas, margaritas that will make you keep coming back, and ridiculous prices that make life worth living."}
{"text":"This really is \"hearty, authentic Mexican\" food! Since this is tucked away in a little corner of Urbana, the Maize-hogging Campustown folk are missing out! Makes me realize that perhaps it's best that small businesses tend to be dispersed, so their food does not pander to the downtown clientele.  We had the A Ver Si Puedes- all that beautifully cooked meat- and the second-best corn tortillas (read: Houston) I've had. And their table sauces are great! I hated how oily the chips were, and I still vote 5 stars!"}
{"text":"While service was a bit slow, I won't let that stop me from coming back. I thoroughly enjoyed the food! When you're first seated you're brought a basket of fresh tortilla chips and four different sauces, all with free refill. As far as drinks there is a lot to select from, but their horchata was some of the best I've ever had in a restaurant. For food I got the taco dinner with beef tongue, and my boyfriend flautas with tongue. Both extremely good though his was seasoned a bit better.  Will definitely be going back within the next week!"}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best breakfast places in the region. Huge variety on the menu. Love it!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Food was great! Absolutely going back! We were greeted as soon as we walked in and checked on constantly. We really felt at home. Authentic food and music."}
{"text":"Not sure how they have 4+ Stars. The salsa is good, chips are a bit too greasy. Food wasn't warm enough and lacked any depth or flavor. It's not bad but not 4 stars."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican cuisine. Pretty good flavors. The pork al pastor leaves something to be desired. The salsa options are a huge plus.  Clean place.  Friendly staff.  Cheap and fast.  Certainly one of the best restaurants in Urbana, for whatever that's worth."}
{"text":"Huaraches is by far the most underrated Mexican restaurant in town. Their food is delicious and the portions are huge. I haven't had a single item there that doesn't taste good. The salsas are spot on and picante! It can be busy during weekends but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"If you need a Mex food fix, this is a good place to go. It's small and cozy (though it can be hot in the summer). The staff there is delightful and attentive when it's not busy. The food is good. I would go even if it were for the complimentary chips & salsas alone! The selection of salsas is like a choose-your-own-adventure. But onto the entrees... I like all of the huaraches I've tried. Lengua tacos and lengua ranchera are my favorites. Carnitas and barbacoa are excellent choices too. The desserts are not bad either. And they have horchata! Reasonable prices, large portions, and great food make this place a winner."}
{"text":"We have previously loved this place, but our last visit, on Sunday evening, was less than great. Service was a bit slow initially, but the real problem was a very messed up order. Ordered cheese dip, didn't get it. Two of our 4 meals had MINOR adjustments (add cheese, no onion) that weren't made. When I ask them to fix it, the response is, \"you're gonna have to wait a few minutes.\" When my meal comes back, it doesn't have onion, or two other ingredients that were supposed to be on it. Chip basket went empty the whole meal. Never did get the bill--finally just went to the register, where I also had to ask for the carryout boxes. Service matters to us, and they're going to have to do better on an almost $50 meal if they want us to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Maybe my favorite restaurant in all of CU. Certainly my favorite Mexican restaurant without a doubt. Super fresh ingredients, an entire menu that they're happy to make vegetarian, excellent service, reasonable prices, and delicious dishes all combine to make Huaraches Moroleon the best choice for Mexican food for miles around. Don't bother going anywhere else."}
{"text":"Salsas were all superb, everything was piping hot and tasted home-made :)  The menu is definitely extensive and you'll get a ton of food with each entree.  Surprisingly, one of my favorite things were the chips - they are clearly made in house and super crispy and thin.  One thing of note: came here at 3pm on Saturday and it was STILL PACKED. Hopefully nobody minded us parking in front of their house, as street parking is all you can basically expect.   According to the BF, tacos are better at Maize, but the selection and everything else is better at Huaraches Moroleon :) C-U sure has some good mexican food!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem Mexican spot in small town Urbana. The service was a bit slow but that is because it was a packed restaurant! My first time I ordered steak tacos and it was the best tacos I had by far in Urbana Champaign. If you are a student, you most likely need a car because it is not on campus and the buses do not go near the restaurant."}
{"text":"The best true mexican food in Champaign Urbana. The atmosphere is great and there menu is huge. The building is very small and the parking is limited but all worth it!!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could keep this place a secret so I would never have to wait for a table whenever I go. The awkward and limited parking at the 5-way intersection of Philo and Washington isn't enough of a deterrent to keep me from getting food here as often as my colon allows. Nothing new that hasn't been said before. The staff is awesome, the food is awesome, the salsas are mind-blowing, and the margaritas are as strong as they are delicious."}
{"text":"Yassssss!!!! BEST huaraches and margaritas!! They have FOUR hot sauces and each of them are super tasty and unique! My favorite is cactus huarache :) also lovely service. This place is the best authentic Mexican place in town!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm not a fan of Mexican food, especially Tex-Mex. BUT, Huarches Morleon looked sketchy enough on the outside that I had to try this place (I believe the best foods are in the sketchiest places). In general, I enjoyed my experience but there are improvements that can be made in the main dish.  As usual, they provided chips and salsa. But they don't give you the gross corn tortilla chips; I think they fried their own chips and they were incredibly crispy and delicious. In addition to that, they had four kinds of salsas/sauces, and woah, all of them were good. The chunky salsa tasted super fresh and the other sauces were creamy and flavorful. 10/10 on the chips and salsa and definitely the best in area.  I got the spicy fajita which came with lots of things. The actual fajita was mediocre. It was made a bit dry and unflavorful and the steak was very tough. I also wasn't getting any spicy flavor. The refried beans were a bit too thin for me and I wasn't a fan of it. The guacamole was chunky (which is the right way to do guac) and seasoned nicely. I just wish they gave more of it, however. It also came with pico de gallo and rice as expected.  The service was super nice and despite the sketch exterior, the interior was super homey.  If I HAD to go to a Mexican place, this place would probably be top on the list, mostly because the chips and salsa are phenomenal."}
{"text":"I have moved away from the area and have not been able to find a place as good as Huaraches. It was a highly anticipated night out for my friends and I. Fajita quesadilla and the see if you can meal is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their fresh, authentic food and they have an excellent breakfast menu as well. It's a relatively small diner, so seating is limited and waiting for the food can get a bit crowded near the cashier."}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time in Arizona and grew up near Chicago. This is the third best Mexican restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Doesn't look like much outside and only has 11 tables inside. Appears carry out is big for them. We ate in and were very excited at the list of authentic dishes and options on the menu. My sister had a veggie dish with cactus as the 'meat' and She LOVED it! My alpastor carcinitos(??) was excellent. My daughter loved the chicken tacos. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican in CU. The chips and salsa's are great. Very chunky and delicious guacamole."}
{"text":"I like this place. As a number of other people have mentioned, the chips and salsa are great. The horchata is also delicious and they give you free refills (utter madness but I love it). However, it wasn't the best mexican I've had, not even close to the top 5. For whatever reason, I was craving enchiladas. They did not turn out well. The sauce that came on the enchilada tasted like it was from a can. just terrible. My girlfriend's meal was much better. She had two steak tacos that looked pretty tasty. She really enjoyed  her meal. I'll be back to see if they just misfired on the enchiladas.  Update: I came back and ordered the fish tacos. they were not good. won't be back."}
{"text":"Good! The salsas and Margaritas are amazing. The food is your typical homemade-quality food you find in local Mexican places. Meaning, good. The beans and rice are a little disappointing but that's the only flaw."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Mexican food. Clean environment and very nice staff! I don't even mind the wait!!"}
{"text":"If there is a better Mexican joint in town, I haven't found it. I don't often factor \"value\" into my take on restaurants, but Huaraches has a lot of very filling meals in the $9-12 range that are also really tasty (and pretty authentic to boot). The enchiladas suizas I had on Thursday were excellent. They seem to have pared down their menu in recent months, so everything left on there is a winner. Good margaritas and a solid selection of Mexican beers too. It's a small restaurant, so be warned on trying to get a table during peak hours without waiting, but know that it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Still great.  Carnitas tacos are probably the best in town (only been to Maize once, though).  My husband and I had a horrible realization one night when we got Taco Bell and only afterwards realized it was $1 taco night at Huaraches.  Noooooooo, worst decision ever!  In summary, Taco Bell is awful and not even that cheap anymore.  Go to Huaraches instead."}
{"text":"Last minute, mid-drive, my friend and I decided to try this place instead of eating at my usually favorite restaurant in Champaign. I am SO glad we went to Huaraches! I had been craving Mexican food for weeks, and man did I get it. I am vegan, and although I cannot confirm if there are traces of dairy/egg, I am happy to say that there are plenty of plants to enjoy at Huaraches.  Loved the decor. Completely captures that stand-alone-full-food-culture experience. Huaraches is small, and can get busy, but that's almost part of the charm about places like this. It's authentic, and clearly worth a shot if it gets so busy. We arrived at the end of the lunch rush, so luckily we were seated quickly; by the time we left, the restaurant had quieted down lots.  The service was nothing spectacular, but being that busy we wouldn't expect to chat with a server anyway. We were there for the food, haha. I'm glad my friend took over the ordering because the menu is overwhelming! The only negative thing I have to say about the food is that I need more stomach! We ordered three entrees to share (we like to eat family style), not even thinking if our stomachs could handle it.  Replacing meat in our dishes, we had cactus for the first time - SO GOOD. Our shared mango margarita was more tequila than mango - that's a positive comment. We sipped on it, more focused on the meal.  Chips warm and not too salty; probably the best salsa/sauces I've had to date. Spicy Guac definitely spicy; I probably prefer regular. Tacos were amazing, the corn tortillas were warm, thick, and soft. Cactus was an exciting new try, and we loved it! Tastes like green peppers. The Torta was pretty good, obviously the bread is the star in that dish.  The Huarache was also a trip. I'm not sure what the tortilla/base is, but it's awesome. Like a taco-quesadilla hybrid?  Everything was served warm, promptly, and aesthetically. Absolutely loved my whole experience here with my best friend and new good food."}
{"text":"Checked out the brunch here on a Saturday morning. Not many people think Mexican for brunch, but this place definitely knows what they are doing. The building is small so seating is limited. I can see it being crowded at peak lunch times. We came at a random time so we were seated immediately but there was a constant rotation of patrons in and out. I got the breakfast huaraches with pork chop and the portion was large and delicious! They also offer menudo for breakfast which looked hot and filling. Definitely will be coming back to try their lunch/dinner! Breakfast here is a must though!!"}
{"text":"The best place to get Mexican food in Urbana-Champaign area.   This place has a hole in the wall feel. But the staff is very fun and kind. I've seen them tolerate rambunctious college students well.   The food is great. I can't recall all of the food I ordered my first trip there but everything was good. And I never forget to order a horchata.  My only complaint would be that there is limited parking. I would try and avoid high traffic meal hours if possible."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in CU. Their food is delicious and very tasty. Not a single time I have been disappointed dining at this place. It's little far from the campus town so all the Maize-fan folks are missing out this authentic Mexican gem. The restaurant is quiet small so there is always a line during peak hours but during summers the outdoor patio is a welcome change. My all time favorite is the canerones a la diabla! The sautéed shrimp in chipotle sauce is very tasty and it's a hearty meal. Their portions are usually very generous. For vegetarians, there is ample choice and they even offer to cook any dish without meat if so desired. They have great selection of margaritas and beers! For dessert, definitely try the caramel churros!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Everything there is delicious. I'm a huge fan of the carnitas huaraches. But I especially love their breakfast and almost always get the Huevos Rancheros. You seriously can't miss with anything on the menu though. The prices and the people are great too!"}
{"text":"So I got here a bit before 9am and saw the hours sign that says it opens at 10 on Monday and thought damnit. While looking up other places, someone came out to tell me it actually is open. So...? Not sure what to trust.  I have to agree with Alex who doesn't understand the hype. There was plenty of food but it all felt cheap and not worth making the trek. Refried beans that look and taste like generic canned beans. Mexican rice that I could've done better at home with tomato chicken bouillon."}
{"text":"Very good mexican food in my neighborhood!  Huraches, sopes, and specials every day. Four types of salsa brought with chips to start the meal."}
{"text":"Best Mexican sit down restaurant in town. Solid food, generous portions. This is one of the few restaurants in the area that do not try to \"simplify\" or \"Americanize\" traditional dishes so there may be a few dishes that you are not familiar but rest assured, all choices are great choices!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome!  I had the three tacos:  chorizo, chicken and ground beef.  The taco shells were super fresh and I love that they provided the lime wedges to give everything that extra fresh taste.  The torillas were excellent as well.  They worked very hard to revamp this place it looks totally different and the decor is very nice.  Small and like a previous reviewer stated, if they stay consistent with this quality, it will be hard to find a seat.  Much like It is hard to get a set at Black Dog.  We will be taking the kids very soon."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican joint in the greater CU area. And it isn't \"Mexican\" like the gringo-oriented places such as Dos Reales or El Toro either. Don't get me wrong, I like Dos Reales for what it is (El Toro not so much), but more often than not I want the real deal. There aren't very many of those in the area, and of the few there are, they tend to be kind of gross.   By contrast, this place is casual and inviting, pleasant and charming. The food is well prepared, well priced and tasty, and the drinks are even better. It would be right at home on 18th Street in Pilsen or 26th Street in Little Village."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I LOVE this place. Consistent service, cheap food, tasty food, and reasonable atmosphere.  It looks like they've got a patio setup for warm weather, and we're looking forward to trying that.  Watch out, the portions are huge."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Champaign-Urbana.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  I especially like the Shrimp a la Diablo, fish tacos, and unique breakfast items, such as the tilapia omelet.  When the owner can get fresh habaneros, the habaneros sauce is fantastic, striking a delicate balance between bringing out the flavor of the pepper without overpowering your taste buds with heat.  However, since he believes in quality, if high quality ingredients aren't available, neither will the sauce.   If you want good, solid, unpretentious real Mexican food, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far the best Mexican food in CU. I am from California so it's not ACTUALLY five star Mexican food, but it is absolutely the best in this area. The fajitas are good and huge. It easily is enough food for 2 meals.   I love salsa and salsa bars. I usually feel like I can accurately judge how good a Mexican restaurant is based on the quality of the sauces. SO I appreciate that this place has some freshly made salsas. The chipotle one is not good, however, the other 3 sauces are fine.  This place is small though so in the evenings you may have to wait a bit for a table. I would definitely come back to Huaraches when I'm in the mood for Mexican in CU."}
{"text":"My wife finally convinced me to take her here. I was a little skeptical, but we went. I am so glad that we did! It  is really good, I think authentic Mexican food. Beats the heck out of El Toros cheese smothered garbage. I had steak and chorizo burrito, my wife had chicken nachos. Both were delicious. Check it out"}
{"text":"Great food - I love their selection of salsas. It turns out mixing the green salsa with the Chipotle tastes amazing. I particularly like their 'hurache' as well. My new favorite mexican restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh, chips are freshly made, nice and crispy. Huge portions of food. They bring a variety of salsas out, and most are spicy, but very good. Some of the best Mexican food I've had. They even have tongue! Definitely a great find!"}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant; it's a great place for Mexican comfort food that is done to a very high standard. I feel like the food here is reminiscent of what homemade Mexican food is like. They have a lovely selection, great service and decent prices too."}
{"text":"If you're tired of the same old run of the mill Mexican food then this is the place to be. The menu had a great variety and the fid was authentic. The flavors were awesomeand the staff was great.  Our server was more than happy to answer any of our questions. Oh, the Horchata was the best! It was fresh and homemade."}
{"text":"Just finished having dinner this evening. The best taco I've ever tried. Actually i LIVE not far away from this restaurant. What a pity that I didn't come here a bit earlier."}
{"text":"It's a small place in the middle of an Urbana neighborhood. The food is amazing, and inexpensive. I had the three fish taco dinner tonight, and boy they were really good. I've been there several times, and I've always had a good time."}
{"text":"Muy autentico, con mucho sabor! This modest little restaurant may look a little dicey on the outside but the food is a slice of Mexico for me. Generous portions of fresh food, well executed. The small number of tables tend to fill quickly so you may want to get here early to beat the lunchtime crowds."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch after having discovered it just by driving by.  Hadn't been in the area since it was an ice-cream shop.  I typically frequent Maize for Mexican food just because it's within a few minutes from my work, but I've been looking to try different places occasionally.  I got 3 different tacos to go (steak, chorizo, chicken).  The tacos were good, but the chorizo was not very flavorful.   Having read other reviews, people say that the chips and salsa are the big draw.  I wasn't offered any with my order to go, so I can't say anything about that.  It's a small place, but has a fair number of seats in it for the space.  That's one big advantage over the obvious comparison to Maize, which has minimal seating.  Overall, the food was not spectacular enough to warrant another 15-20 minutes of extra driving for lunch, but I'd be willing to go back for a sit-down meal to try out the chips and salsa with their other entree selections.   Recommend that you start offering chips/salsa to people (like me) who make to-go orders!"}
{"text":"The chips and 5 different kinds of salsa are homemade-everything is fresh and made from scratch, prices reasonable, portions generous, the place is well-lit and clean, the service great and staff friendly. On a Wednesday night, this place was PACKED and there were constant carry out orders being made, as well. I want to go back there and try every single thing on the menu! Over and over! This place is every bit as GOOD as Manzella's is BAD! My sister and I both agreed we will keep going back for more!!!"}
{"text":"On my way from Toledo,OH to try this place then on my way home to Jacksonville,IL Reviews afterwards due to Sunday Late Morning and visit a friend live nearby.  Serving breakfast now as wasn't in the mood for that. Very kind to offer me the lunch menu - getting my order down also providing me their chips and salsa.  One friend says many like this place w 12 tables. Small place must been changed over from a gas station  Now having my meal and nice to offer me their Mexican drink sampler shh but my waitress sure will get a big tip!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great authentic food! We are in Champaign once a week and this is where we go every time for breakfast."}
{"text":"Their salsa is really good, people are really nice and helpful, tacos are best, and soup is interesting"}
{"text":"Came back here for a date night on a Thursday.  We ate in and the small restaurant was nearly full by the time we got there. The place is a little out of the way but definitely a hidden gem.  We perused the menu and were given the delicious tortilla chips with 4 kinds of salsa. I enjoyed all the salsas, the chipotle one is very spicy and I also liked the verde.  We decided to split a lime margarita for our drink and this exceeded expectations. Oddly served in a beer mug, this margarita was delicious! Not too sugary and not too sweet or overpowering, it was great for $4.  My girlfriend got chicken fajitas while I opted for a barbacoa burrito with mole sauce, and a single nopales (cactus) taco on the side. She said the fajitas were delicious and for about a $10 plate, it was absolutely huge and we definitely had leftovers.  My burrito was also tasty. I really like mole sauce and when it was combined with a nice meaty burrito it was great! I was a little let down that I didn't get any guacamole with my pico de gallo, since the menu said it was included but there didn't appear to be any on the plate. Not a big deal, but maybe they should update the menu accordingly.  The nopales taco was surprisingly good. I didn't think edible cactus would be very good, but it was! It tasted a lot like green peppers and I would get it again.  Our server was good and accommodating. We aren't that needy so I would say he did a fine job.  Overall a great dine-in experience here. I think this is one of the best Mexican places in C-U."}
{"text":"Really, really yummy. Looks like a hole in the wall from the outside and limited seating but friendly service and DELICIOUS food. Homemade chips w/ 4 salsas. The beans they serve are delicious, as is the rice. Make sure to check the specials on the board behind the cash register. It can be easy to miss but usually has some yummy options. The chocolate cake is definitely for 2 people and not cheap but soooo yummy. Also good horchata.Guacamola is also not cheap but straight outta the avocado fresh and enough for 4 probably."}
{"text":"Great place!  The chips are awesome and so is the rest of the food.  It's a tiny restaurant, somewhat of a \"hole in the wall\" but the food is delicious!  Best Mexican in town!  Parking is very limited and so is seating"}
{"text":"Early lunch on Saturday, ordered huaraches azteca al pastor. Very pleased with the plate.  Skirt steak, lettuce, tomato avocado over a thick tortilla.  Served with 4 salsas and chips.  Spanish speaking customers seem to get a fifth salsa that is orange, just like a habanero.  The Mexican guy across the aisle from me definitely broke a sweat during lunch - don't know if it was the orange mystery salsa, but guessing it was.  I'll be back but note the booths are a tight fit and there's only 20 - 30 seats, so carry out might be a consideration."}
{"text":"Wow what a great find! It's rare to find great Mexican street food and good drinks. I recommend the skinny margarita for your fresh not so sweet margarita. The salsas are fantastic"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants ever known to man, everything is just perfectly placed and presented, and the food is just heaven sitting on a plate. I would rate 999999999999999999999999999999999 stars, but it only allows 5:(."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and this review is for my second visit. I came for lunch with a friend. They were no specials so I had the flautas with beans. Now a flauta is just a fried, rolled tortilla stuffed with something. Not hard to get wrong. These flautas were not very tightly wrapped and the beans were just laying in inside. The plus is that the lunch was $6 or so with rice, beans, and lettuce. I was just disappointed overall."}
{"text":"This is a local 5. It is really the only legit Mexican place around. Sorry Maize, you have good ingredients, but your burritos are wrapped too loosely and they are small. Huaraches has an authentic taste, great ingredients, and I haven't had anything bad from here. The side of nachos with jalapeños and ballpark nacho cheese threw me off the first time, but now I think it's charming.  Now, compared to other areas, this might be a 4, but around here I think this is really the only game in town."}
{"text":"the chorizo burrito was life-changing and their margaritas are ginormous, which i am an avid supporter of."}
{"text":"This is the best place for mexican in Urbana. They give you a huge selection of sauces and many of their tortillas are homemade. My favorite sauce has to be the smoky creamy chipotle sauce. It's got just enough kick and that smoky flavor is awesome! They have some pretty tasty margaritas but I would probably get them on the rocks because I ordered mine frozen and it came out unpleasantly warm. Probably because it came from a warm blender, but the warm plastic glass they served it in didn't help. I ordered a nopales huarache and I'm pretty sure the nopales were canned because they were incredibly salty. Other than being too salty, the huarache was delicious! My favorite item so far is the fajitas quesadilla! It's got lots of tasty grilled vegetables and plenty of cheese all over!"}
{"text":"Love Huaraches! It has been a great addition to the neighborhood, even though it is in a bit of a random location as far as restaurants go! I am just happy to have something so cheap and delicious within walking distance of my mom's house when I come down to CU for a visit.   I have been here several times now and each time am very happy with the quality and service. The salsas are all great, each their own unique flavor. The chips are always fresh and crispy. Most recently I got the traditional steak tacos. The steak was flavorful and tender, and I love whatever corn tortillas they use (maybe they make in house?). There are so many items to choose from and a pretty good vegetarian selection as well.   You can't beat it for cheap eats. I love that it has more of an authentic vibe than the other Tex Mex joints in town."}
{"text":"This is a new addition to my neighborhood  replacing a chicken and fish joint. For those who do not know a huarache is like a large version of a taco with handmade corn tortilla. The food I have tried there so far has been great!  Love pineapple on my tacos! The owners are very helpfull if you are confused about what to order and are willing to customize your  dinner any way you like.  Note, no credit cards yet.  But I am sure that will change. Definitely going back soon!   New note,  just heard that the grand opening special for Monday  the19th will be 99 cent tacos,   Better stay outa my way!"}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you, go on in.  4 salsas, each distinct from mild to hot & home made chips, great!  Fajitas Huaraches Moroleon was HUGE and delicious.  Wife had a Chicken Chimichanga that she also liked very much.   Guacamole appetizer was as good as everyone has mentioned.  Only downside, this is a very small place,  about 12 tables so don't tell anyone about it :)"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and I really don't understand the hype.   I had some tacos and my friends ordered tacos and a \"huarache\". The food was notttt good at all! I really can't understand how this is a top restaurant in Champaign.   The lengua tacos smelled like fish! And the texture was hard and gross. The chicken taco I had was okay but it was all I ate.   The order we placed even took like an hour to come out. An hour for a very small amount of good. They also don't give a lot of salsa. Also, the huarache looks like a large flour tortilla. I will never come back here again. Even the interior isn't good.   Overall not good at all."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Urbana-Champaign. Give it a try, you won't regret it.   The fajitas are enough to feed at least 2 people and probably even 3 adults.   The service can be a little slow, but it is well worth the wait and they are always super friendly.  I recommend any of the tacos, they are all delicious or the fajitas I mentioned above!"}
{"text":"!st time visit as an out of towner from the STL area where we have a plethora of authentic Mexican family run restaurants. I had the lengua, al pastor and chicharrones tacos. The lengua was a tender as I've ever had. Barbacoa was delicious. The star was the chicharrone taco was the best taco I ever ate.  Crunchy yet chewy...WOW is all I can say. Perfect amount of heat made it spot on. Nicely done!!"}
{"text":"Always love this place! Try their lunch special with 2 beef enchiladas, 1 chicken taco, and rice and beans ($6.99). Delicious! Their chips are a little on the greasy side, but they're still addicting. Yummy sauces to accompany them. Try this little place!"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Mexican food I've tasted in Champaign. This place is not a fancy restaurant, it's just a place to eat and chill. Dips and tortilla chips were just lovely. I love how they come in such huge \"bottles\" and you can pour yourselves as much as you need. Food was delicious. I had a burrito with mole sauce. Honestly, the mole sauce was not enough. I'd love to have more of it flooding my burrito and not just trickles of it. It could be a little sweeter but I believe that's just my preference. As price and portion go, I would say they are average. Not too expensive, just the right amount with an average price ($$). But quality and taste were on point for Champaign."}
{"text":"I love the taco dinner with carnitas and my fiancé loves the al pastor. The refried beans are made fresh and are the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Huaraches is definitely the most delicious Mexican food I've had in cu, get the carnitas or the skillets for breakfast, so good!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Update: It only took 2 more years for me to come back to this restaurant. There are a couple of other restaurants now in town that can give this place a run for the money in terms of authentic mexican food. They have traditional pozole and the food appears to be home made and made fresh. I ended up getting the three steak taco meal with spanish rice and refried beans. I can't say that it was the best tacos I have had, but I think it was my fault for getting them with flour tortilla instead of corn tortilla. They are garnished well with ontions, cilantro, cheese, and tomatoes which goes well. They still give you the multiple complimentary salsa with tortilla chips which is a plus!"}
{"text":"YES.  Finally went here after a bunch of friends have been telling me how great it is and I was not disappointed.  Everything was super inexpensive, we got a ton of food, left full and happy and the place itself is tiny and cute. Definitely one of the better Mexican restaurants in CU."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, great service and prices that can't be beat! A trio of salsas with home made chips when you sit down, and the huaraches are to die for! I really hope this place makes it."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I have never had a poor meal here. We usually get takeout but occasionally dine in. My husband got the fish tacos and found them to be delicious. I got the huarache azteca to see what a huarache was. It reminds me of a tostada but with a soft tortilla with a crisp side. I love the punto beans at this place. I didn't think I liked punto beans then I had theirs."}
{"text":"By far the most authentic Mexican cuisine I've had, though I can't say I'm a Mexican cuisine expert. Flavors are bolder, meat isn't as cheap, and well paced service compared to the other Mexican restaurants in town. They offer 4 sauces for your crisp, oily chips. Though the sauces are quite watered down, having diff. options is quite refreshing.  If I had to pick Mexican, this place is my number one. The place itself is quite small, adding to its homely charm, though you might end up fighting for parking spots and dining seats."}
