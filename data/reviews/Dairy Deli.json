{"text":"Stopped by here on the way back from working late.  Didn't want another fast-food burger or taco, so I stopped here when I saw the big \"Hot Corned Beef Anytime\". Being a supporter of mom and pop stores, I gave it a try.  My mistake.  You would think a deli/convenience store that hypes its Corned Beef would really make a great sandwich, right?  Wrong.  for $9.00 I got a sparsely piled sandwich on rye bread that was falling apart.  Worse, the \"Hot\" was courtesy of a quick burst in a dirty microwave, served in a plastic zip log bag. Classy, huh? They didn't even bother to cut the sandwich in half.  NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm here at least a few times a week for years. For a neighborhood mom and pop their beer and wine selection is extensive and the owners are always SO nice! Also, the pepperoni nuggets are highly addictive and you can't eat just one... :)
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood deli! The chicken and rice soup with chick peas is delicious! Big fan of their Orzo salad and spinach pies."}
{"text":"They have the best baklava I have ever had... and some drizzled in chocolate!  Super moist and flaky.  Not a huge fan of the food because it is more sour than I like.  However, their wine selection is great and the people are always so nice.  Love this place!  $10 minimum for cc (a tray of baklava is $11 so no prob there :) )

Also, their pizza is pretty good.  Very thick doughy crust."}
{"text":"A good alternative to Aladdin's if you live or work in the Seven Hills / Independence area. The store is right in the middle of a residential neighborhood and out of the madness and corporate wasteland that is Rockside Road. I went with my buddy for lunch today. It is a corner store that has all of the normal snacks, drinks and beer you will usually see. They bake their own spinach pies and have various Lebanese food items. I would recommend the tabbouleh and couscous. The hummus was decent. It tasted store bought without much flavor. There are two picnic tables outside that you can eat at. It was so peaceful today out there with the lush green trees surrounding us. Dairy Deli aka George's Deli is an oasis. The two store owners are nice people. The ethnic lady at the counter had some funny things to say. I asked if I could have a fork and she said \"You want a knife too? So you can stab each other?\" I then said how I need it to stab myself. Because it is a Monday. And I work with stupid people. She didn't give me the plastic butter knife after all. $10 credit card minimum."}
