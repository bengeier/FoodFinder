{"text":"Peter Kope and Michele de la Reza are smart, fiercely devoted to their art (modern dance) and determined to do good by whomever they meet. The creative inspirations behind Pittsburgh's Attack Theatre met us at Draai Laag Brewing Company for three rounds of sour beers, a Slobby Bifko (that's a brisket sandwich with cheddar, pickled onions and horseradish mayo) and other-worldly ice cream sandwiches from Leona's Ice Cream.  In my first flight I tried Black Briar--Draai Laag's signature American wild ale made with blackberries. It is solid. Deep. But my first swigs smelled like ammonia. \"Yeast,\" said Michelle. Dave behind the bar assured us that the huge head--he had four foamy glasses settling below the taps--didn't indicate anything was wrong with the keg. Once, he said, they had a beer where they had to draw a whole pitcher of foam and wait for it to settle to pour one glass.  The other winner in that flight was Razmata. \"There are two distinct notes,\" Michelle said. \"The Weiss beer and the raspberry.\" She was right, according to the menu. It's a raspberry Berliner Weiss.  I wish I could give you a report from my second flight, with R2Koelschip, Tafelboer and Relic, but honestly all the sours started tasting the same at that point. Michelle ordered a glass of the Relic, however. She said it smelled like a campfire. (I thought it smelled like a camp latrine.)  I like sour beers, honest. I even like Draai Laag's sours. All misplaced snottiness aside, I don't think they do anything poorly, and I don't think that I have the discriminating palate to tell if they did. But nothing I drank gave me the life-changing aha of the Fetish Brewing Company Wild American Dark in Lancaster, Pa., or the Belgian drinkability of Ommegang's Rosetta, or the confident satisfaction nearly anything I've tried from Free Will Brewing Company in Perkasie, Pa.  But I like to drink, and I like to try new food, and I like sitting outside in beautiful weather with some of the best people I know. Pretty sweet."}
{"text":"Saints and Turncoats - Draai Laag  Pittsburgh has a great beer scene. Each brewery has their own special trait that makes them stand out: Draai Laag has fantastic Belgian beer. Unfortunately, if you aren't a fan of Belgian beers, they do not have much to offer outside of their specialty. But if you love this type of beer, they do it extremely well. Their craft is refined: if you take the time to go to their website, they describe each of their beers and the process it takes to make each of them. What I enjoyed most is their use of unique yeasts and fermentation styles.  We got the beer flight and tried them all. Our favorites were the Haviken - a smooth, darker beer with roasted flavors and the Cru - sour beer with a unique story.  There is excellent outdoor seating that makes this brewery the perfect place to drink beer with friends on a sunny afternoon. I loved the atmosphere of the place. Workers there were patient and willing to explain all of the beers for newcomers.  So here's the deal, Pittsburgh has a lot of fantastic breweries. Each has their own personality that speaks to different people: different atmosphere and different specialty beers that ranges in alcohol content and strength of spices. The only way to know which one works best for you is to go forth and try them. I highly recommend Draai Laag if you love Belgian beers."}
{"text":"Lack of kitchen is the first downside that I could find. The bartender recommended the flight and three types of beer, one of which didn't sit well with me and I returned the full glass. The bartender asked about the full glass and I said I didn't like it to which she said 'ok' and left!  Another person came up (didn't introduce himself) asked about if everything was ok, Assuming this was the manager and he was going to set things right I informed him and he offered me another drink....AT AN ADDITIONAL FULL PRICE!!    They need to REALLY brush up on their customer service if they intend to stay in business in this area of micro brews.."}
{"text":"A nice change of pace from the inescapable presence of IPAs. Great beers and atmosphere.  Be careful, these sours will sneak up on you.  We appreciated that the brewery allowed us to bring outside food to go along with the brews."}
{"text":"My favorite way to describe the beers here at Draai Laag is funky. Funky in the most absolute best way possible! These are some of the best beers I've had. With names like, Aureus, the Plauge, Ruby du Rhone, how can you go wrong? They have added an outdoor patio area, which is huge! I love ordering flights of three because I can try any new beers that they have available. The food from Black Shepard Farms is outstanding paired with beer here. I'm always looking forward to see what their newest beers will be. Great brewery in good old Millvale!"}
{"text":"Everyone working here takes pride in the beer they brew and are knowledgeable about them! Unique rustic atmosphere and the food vendors that come from time to time are great. I could write for hours about the beer, but I'll keep it short. The Belgian inspired brews are very complex and all delicious!"}
{"text":"This brewery combines elements of Belgian and French brewing traditions along with local flora to create mostly sour beers and has recently added a food menu featuring meat from Pittsburgh Smokehouse. I'm a big fan, and try to make it about twice a month if not more often. So far I have not been disappointed in the food. I've had the Sobby Bifko featuring smoked brisket, cheddar cheese, pickled onions (these are great because they don't leave a strong onion taste in your mouth), fresh jalapeno's and horseradish mayo on a baguette and the godzilla dog which is a very large smoked andouille sausage, blue cheese, picked onions, shredded carrots and cilantro.  I can't believe I ate the whole thing, it was that big. I look forward to trying more dishes using meat from the Pittsburgh Smokehouse."}
{"text":"Can be a bit pricey and the quantity of drinks for the price is questionable. They have a good series of food trucks that come by, though."}
{"text":"It wasn't until we left that I was informed this place specialized in sour beers. I really like a sour beer, and believe me I appreciate weird and creative drafts, but you cannot expect me to enjoy a porter that tastes like grapefruit juice. I suppose if you're really into sour beers, this is the place to go, but it's not a place I would recommend to most of my friends. The staff ranges from very amiable to borderline miserable. The atmosphere was generally mellow.   This place purported they were dog friendly on their signs, but then the owner told us to leave the outside area after my friend brought his very obedient Aussie dog. Wouldn't even allow us to finish our round; straight to the parking lot... Okay, so, we took a nice 10 minute walk to another brewing establishment close by in Millvale that we found to have superior drinks, and was truly dog friendly."}
{"text":"What can I say... this is simply the best beer that you're ever going to taste!  I'm a huge fan of local breweries and Draai Laag is first in class.  This Pittsburgh Gem is a great spot to meet on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  The staff is knowledgable, friendly and you never wait for a beer!  And once you taste Draai Laag beers, you'll understand why it's hard to wait for your next draft.  My personal favorites are Simon Girty and Goedenact-- the gifts that keep on giving!!  Kudos to the genius behind these recipes-- modern day Einstein when it comes to making beer!  Thank you for your contribution to delicious brew my friend.  Cheers to all!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! Not only does this place have unique and delicious Belgian-style beer, but the staff is also friendly and knowledgeable as well. I ordered the Funky Peach beer and loved the perfect balance of sweet and sour to its taste. Our group ordered the beer bread as well and everyone thought it was delicious! I will definitely order Draai Laag beer in the future!"}
{"text":"Just went here for t first time and the beer was very good plus I loved the outdoor area. There were several sour beers to choose from and the staff was helpful about picking out one to suit my tastes/giving samples before buying. It was even \"sour hour\" when I went where the drafts are $1 off on weekdays from 5-7. There where several picnic tables and a couple regular tables in the outside area. It was a bit loud outside from Route 28 being right above/behind the building but not enough to bother you. I also loved that they had parking spots and even bike racks.   The food menu was very limited and I'm a bit picky so I didn't try anything to eat. It was a lot of smoked BBQ type options."}
{"text":"This gets all my stars, hands down. Have loved this place since the very start. My love and adoration for sours began here. Dark, light, whatever your sour beer taste, it's all here. Also, very cool place to hang. They have various card and board games on hand. Since the renovation, the place is a lot more open and inviting (although, I didn't mind the dungeon-like vibe from before). The outdoor seating is great. The menu could be a bit more diversified (i.e. Cater to vegetarian lifestyle), but, imho, as a sour beer lover, the beer makes up for it."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been to both locations and it's very cool atmosphere at both. We are huge IPA fans but every time we go here I try beers I usually wouldn't and they are wonderful! Very different but one of my top 5 breweries in Pittsburgh!!! Food at Taste House was really delicious and food truck at brewery we had a bbq sandwich and chips that were delicious!!! We will be back to both!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to many breweries to know what's a really good one or not, but from my experience here I was pretty satisfied and had a good time.   I read other reviews before coming and all of them said that Draai Laag is known for \"sour\" beers, which I didn't understand what that was... so my friends and I ordered a flight of 3 different drinks - The Mark, Geestelijke, and Arsenal Cider. The Mark almost looked like red wine and tasted a bit like it. Geestelijke is known to be a more moderate level sour but I liked this one the best. My taste is more on the strong side so I liked the Geestelijke. The Arsenal Cider was okay... didn't really give the typical cider taste but it was okay.   For food, I saw the Smokehouse Nachos in one of the pictures before coming and knew I had to order that. We ordered it with brisket and it was so yummy. The nacho chips were almost toasted which gave it a bit of a crunch and crispy taste. And my friend ordered the Bomb Mi sandwich with a side of cajun potato salad. We thought it was a pretty westernized version of a vietnamese banh mi sandwich. The cajun potato salad was delicious though.   I think the best part about this brewery is the outdoor seating. There are hanging lights all around that would be lit up during sunset/night time, so definitely makes up the mood of the experience. The seating areas are just enough for small and large groups. And the service was really friendly overall.  Would definitely come back again :)"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and everyone was really nice. Unfortunately I am not a fan of sour beer. I wish they would brew a more common beer like an IPA or stout."}
{"text":"First visit since the name change. Tried the cake beer, it was light and refreshing. New decor makes for a more trendy and low key atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinker, as a rule.  I mean... I hate IPA's (they smell like cat urine and taste the way they smell), I'll have a stout, ONE, in the winter time.  So the fiance and I head over to Draai Laag before hitting Mr. Smalls for the Guided By Voices show.  We do a flight each, 6 out of the 8 beers.      Apples & Pears     Petite Ferme     Aureus     Simon Girty     Funky Peach     R2 Koelschip Ale  They were ALL awesome. I mean ALL of them. I've never been so excited and happy to be drinking beers. I tend to lean toward \"sour\" beers over the funky/ipa/dark beers. The staff here was knowledgeable, kind, helpful, and very welcoming.  So great beers? Check! Outdoor setting? Check! Food? Oh.. yeah there's a food truck there! It switches around constantly but we happened to land there on a day that had \"Second Breakfast\" truck.  It's got a nice small gravel lot that if you're lucky enough, you can park in.  Out of all the beers I tried... Aureus was by far my favorite, then Apples & Pears, Funky Peach, Simon Girty, Petite Ferme, and R2. I like the no frills quality this place has.   Oh... and the bathrooms are clean and nice! Trust me... that's hard to come by in beer gardens."}
{"text":"This place is a must when looking for some legit sour beers and a chill vibe. I am terrible at remembering the names of the beers, and they rotate from time to time, but everything I have tried was good! You can get a flight of a few samples, or you can commit to a full glass of one which is always nice. The food here is also legit - our table got the nachos and brisket tacos...both were great, and they came out so fast!  The outdoor patio space is so chill. If it's really nice out it might be kind of tough to get a seat out there, but the inside is just as cool! The location itself is super easy to get to, and parking wasn't an issue to get. We will for sure be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Super friendly ownership and staff. The beers push the limits but are really well done. If you like sour beers there isn't a better place in Pittsburgh to enjoy them."}
{"text":"I went to Strange Roots on Saturday. I've been wanting to try this place for a month since we went to the Food Truck park. It looks very cute from the road!  Anyways we came for a drink on Saturday. They have an amazing outdoor area with plenty of tables and its kid friendly!!! Love anywhere that I can be comfortable bringing my daughter.  The bar is inside as well as several other tables. I tried 3 different beers and I really wasn't a fan of any of them. Not their fault they just weren't my style. They do have a menu, we didn't try any food as we had just come from dinner. I would be willing to go back and try it. It looked like they also have an event coming up called Taco Mania which seems fun.  They have a small parking lot. It was full when we were there but were able to find a spot within a couple of blocks."}
{"text":"Located in a small building in Millvale, they specialize in great Belgian Style Ales. They are delicious. No food---just Belgian Ales. Some of the best around. If you like Belgian Style Ales, this is the place for you. Our favorites are Haviken, Simon Girty,  and St. Angus. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Yea it's all interesting and very good! Service a little slow and not organized and food is impossible to get apparently. But beer is good. Had a flight with geestelijke, relic, and haviken. First one was the best. And the ragnarak was awesome too. Bunch of hard things to spell and say but just point and enjoy haha. Might even buy some to take back."}
{"text":"Service was good but the beer was less than desirable. The reviews say that it's spectacular but the senses say this place is critical. Felt awkward and out of place."}
{"text":"This was the first stop on our rainy day in the Burgh Brewery Tour.  I've driven past here many times and loved the outdoor seating area.  The interior is dimly lit and has a great vibe to it with a huge mural and wooden walls.  The place was packed and pretty loud but not ear splitting and we were quickly greeted and redirected to a different table because the one we chose was so wobbly, he likened it to dining on a cruise ship.  Ahoy DRAAI LAAG brewery men! Permission to sample some beers?  Once we got setup at our new table, we chose some beer and some food.  The beers are all pretty sour which I typically associate with gose style beers (which I think are German sour beers)  but they call theirs wild, I believe, and these are more French and Belgian.  I am obviously not a beer snob but I took time to ask our server about this and he explained it although I may have butchered his technical brewing explanation.  We also tried to ask him about the pending change to this brewery - a new name -and we wanted to understand what that meant to the beers they might add to their offerings.  He was not very helpful in that regard. The new brewery will be called Strange Roots Experimental Ales but we have no idea what new brews will be brewing, folks.   The food was very good.  Surprisingly good, actually, because no one was eating in the entire place.  We wavered on whether or not to order for several minutes and then decided, why not?  Boy, am I glad we did!  We tried the smoked pork tacos that come with a little pickled onion, lime, cilantro, and cotija cheese.  Super flavor profile.  We devoured ours in a short order but left a mess since we split the two tacos and they never brought a plate or anything to split them.  Mucho messio!    The beers were good too.  I have been wanting to try more of the sours and this was a great selection.  It takes some getting used to, for sure, but there is a beauty in these sours that you don't find in other styles of beer. If you are interested in trying some, the sampler of three for $12 is the way to go.  You get a nice pour of each and can easily share them.  Our favorite was the Wit but the raspberry was pretty good too.  The only issue we had, and this is sort of a big one, was the service.  It's a strange setup if you are not familiar with the place.  There are tables or bars you can sit at but the servers are also the bartenders (at least it appeared that way) so when the place gets a big group, all servers on deck to pour beers and forget about asking your server for something.  I was ready to leave at one point but my \"better half\" wanted to stay so we did. So you don't really have an assigned waiter.  They need to tell you that or change their model to have actual servers. It's annoying when you don't understand their service model and results in a less than stellar experience.  It all made sense when we asked for our check and he asked if we started a \"tab.\""}
{"text":"This was my second time stopping at this brewery and I was really hoping that I would be more impressed with their sours (as it's my favorite beer style). It seems as though some people really like their beer and I wasn't a huge fan the last time we visited. We wanted to give it another try since we were in the area.   We ordered a flight to try a few different sours that they had on tap. We had the Ragnarok, Black Briar, and the La Pienture. Sadly, I did not like any of them :(. They had such a strong vinegar taste and I couldn't really appreciate the other flavors. I was so disappointed.   They have a good bit of seating inside and out. The prices are okay. They don't do growlers - only bottle sales. They do have a food menu (I've not tried anything on it, though).   Overall, it's a really cool establishment and they've got a great spot in Millvale. The staff behind the counter were also very friendly. I just have not yet had a beer [sour] that impressed me the two times I've stopped by."}
{"text":"If you like Belgians/Sours you will love this place.  I tend to be more of a hop head and you will not find that here.  However, I must say I am starting to come on board with Sours.  This may be the best brewery in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The inside bar had fun decor and was inviting. The staff was super nice.   Between the group of 8 of us, we got 4 different beers and I tried all of them. They were all sours.  I like some sour beers but I would have hoped for more variety.  The beers I tasted were very good but just not my style.   Very relaxing and roomy outdoor seating area.  I'll be back for sure, real cool spot."}
{"text":"Hands down the best beer I've ever had in my 29 years of existence. A welcoming tap room with some decent eats. Draai laag offers beer unlike any beer you've had - Belgian sour is the base term for this type of brew, but you'd be hard pressed to find a Belgian sour as crisp, fruity, and as strong as these bad boys. If you're lucky enough to come in when Allemande or Razmata are on tap (lambic cross-over sours) definitely don't miss the opportunity. Beers here range from 4-11% abv. so be careful, the 4%ers have as much taste as the 11's and the 11's you can't feel the strength till you're half-way though if you know what I mean!"}
{"text":"As a huge sour beer lover, I was delighted to finally visit Draai Laag. It did not disappoint! I think (between flights & trying friends' beers,) I sampled every beer on the list and loved every one. Even my friends who don't love sours were able to find beer they enjoyed here as there aren't too many tart choices and some even taste more like a cider. The atmosphere is great and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, which is always a plus. I highly suggest doing one of their flights if it's your first time so you can sample a few choices!  I only wish they would allow dogs here, even just for the outdoor space. For that reason alone, I tend to go to Gristhouse, down the road, more often. Once it cools down for fall/winter, I'm sure I'll be back here more!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how people can say the atmosphere was great and the service was awesome but then rate 3 stars because they \"don't care for sour beers.\" That's like going to an amazing sushi restaurant and having great sushi but reviewing them poorly because you're \"more of a fried chicken person.\" To each his own but for Pete's sake, give them some credit!  This place does sour beers. They are very good sour beers. If you don't know if you like sour beers, this is a great place to try them. They have a great variety to choose from and will gladly explain the differences between them.   The atmosphere at Draai Laag is very rustic. The inside decor makes a very cool space and the lighting and barrel tables outside make it a great place to spend an evening as long as it isn't too cold."}
{"text":"We added Draai Laag to our list of breweries to visit due to its close proximity to other breweries.  I unlike my husband was not aware they only serve sour beers.  I knew they had unique beers but was not prepared for was they were all sours.    First off, I thought their taproom was very lovely.  If it were not such a nice afternoon out we probably would have just opted to stay at the bar.  Modern and industrial, so decor scores.  Next, the bartender was extremely friendly and spoke to us in length about their beers and their story. I love it when we go to a brewery and the people serving the beer have something more to say to you besides \"what can I get you? Or here is your check.\"  He was very informative and gave the space a welcoming vibe.    Since I really did not think I would like any of their beers I opted to go with the Black Dino, because they brew it with coffee and it had the highest ABV of all the offerings.  Heck if I have to drink a beer I probably will not like then I am going hard.  After we paid, we headed outside to check out their courtyard.   The courtyard was cute.  Many high tops, picnic tables, plants, and even though it is close to the highway, had a great pavilion coverage and a trendy horizontal fence that gave it a secluded private feeling.  I loved how the outside looked.  I was not a huge fan of the dead air that hung around.  I wish they had at the least some kind of music playing or other source of entertainment to soak up traffic noise.    As we sipped our beer, I noticed their menu looked great.  I was getting hungry and was on the move to order some food but we just could not enjoy our beers.  My husband ended up dumping his out about half way through.  I on the other hand am against alcohol abuse and finish every drop at a fast as I could pace.    This place is adorable.  The people were friendly and informative.  They have a delicious sounding menu and a lovely space, but we came for beer and I just was not a fan.  If you are, you will love it I am sure."}
{"text":"Draai Laag, aside from having an awesome name, has awesome beer, awesome food, and an awesome ambiance. Think upscale brewery--nice clean bathrooms, nice decor inside, nice non-smoking patio (thank you!). Much of the beer (all?) is brewed with naturally occurring yeasts, and to me tastes a little Belgian inspired. Delicious. Food wise, the BBQ pork sandwich is amazing, and the nachos with pulled pork were legit. Yes! This restores my faith in nachos! A little spicy too... yum."}
{"text":"*Please note: Draai Laag Brewing's taproom was previously known as Saints and Turncoats Public House (I've included some of my original review comments here along with some new observations).  More reviews can be found under the old listing and the info about the beer and location are comparable.  It should also be noted that the address is confusing because it's on East Ohio Street in Millvale.  The building is relatively plain and the sign, unless you're really looking for it, is small in relation to the building and not well lit.  When you do find the location, it seems unclear if you can park in front of the building or not (you can).  But if you can get over this initial confusion, it is more than worth it.  As with most local breweries, hours at Draai Laag are limited.  Currently they are only open Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  Since my first visit, the interior has changed slightly (the bar isn't up with those high chairs anymore and is now in a different location inside the taproom).  There are still several tables scattered with games and they've begun encouraging a weekly game night.  Still no televisions so don't go here expecting to watch a game.  Fair warning, it's not that kind of bar.  I think I preferred the original taproom over the renovation.  The new Draai Laag is still a good place to meet old friends and make new friends.  Also on the positive side, they have upped the food game with the addition of Black Shepherd Farms on Fridays (menu changes weekly but I stopped in for the stuffed flank steak and was not disappointed) and food trucks on a regular basis.  The draft selection rotates through their list of beers with several others available in bottles to go.  If you like Belgian brews, you will like just about anything at Draai Laag (my personal favorite being the Simon Girty).  ABV in most of their beers is a little higher and as expected the cost of a drink has increased to around $6-$7.  Flights are still offered for those who want to try a variety.  Their briars are popular with fans of sour beers.  I haven't tried all their beers, but I'd recommend the Goedenacht to anyone who likes farmhouse ales.    I recommend following their Facebook page for updates on what beers are available (especially if you have a favorite since all beers aren't always available) and any food trucks or events planned."}
{"text":"My husband and I ventured out to Millvale on the day that the new tap room was unveiled. The atmosphere in this place is stunning and looks like a page from a Restoration Hardware catalog. The bar is made from a log and wow, I couldn't stop running my hands over the smooth surface! This place definitely gave me rustic goals when it comes to home decor.  The beer is German style sour and is something very different for this lover of fruity and light lagers. I found a fruity style cider than I enjoyed, but was unable to find anything else in the flight I sampled that I would like to sip on. I know their selection will change with the season, so I hope to make this a stop on a summer bike ride (not far from the trail!) and sample another brew. A plus is that they invite local food trucks, so you can eat, drink and be merry! Pittsburgh Smokehouse happened to be there when we stopped and we enjoyed their food very much! Check the Facebook page to see who will be featured before you stop."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful, first and foremost. Friendly staff, food trucks outside, AMAZING patio. On a beautiful day, this is the place to be. Let me just forewarn you that their specialty as far as beers go, are sour beers. If you are not a sour beer person, there may be some choices for you, but I wouldn't count on finding too many. Myself, I do like the occasional sour brew, so I enjoyed it. My favorite beer was their raspberry, which was the brewer's special. I am looking forward to the weather getting warmer in Pittsburgh, so I can hang out on the patio again."}
{"text":"If you like sours this is your place! They have a great variety that range from hoppy to light and with their sampler options it is easy to find one that you love!  I have had great interactions with the staff members, very friendly and helpful. Their system for waiting tables includes allowing the customer to change the card on the table to signify when you need service or your check. As they put it \"so we don't bother you too much or too little\" -- I thought that was great! It let us sit and talk uninterrupted, but also got us service promptly when needed. We didn't get any food, but the menu was interesting to me. If we didn't already have dinner plans I would have tried something.  I'm looking forward to returning in the warm weather, the outdoor space is gorgeous and I'm sure will be great on a warm evening."}
{"text":"Did not have a chance to try their food.  It is an amazing place if you are a fan of all types of sours.  Will be very interested to try them again next time we are in town.  Bonus is they have a parking lot."}
{"text":"First time back since name change. Still have a good sour but not as many to choose from. Good tacos Poblano and potato very good. Will be back"}
{"text":"I wish I could review Draai Laag'a beer, but unfortunately I couldn't get served. We sat at two open seats at the bar. There were maybe 3 or 4 other tables. We sat at the bar for 15 minutes and no one so much as made eye contact. No greeting or anything. Not one person at the bar was served in those 15 minutes we waited. I'm not sure what the servers and bartenders were doing, but not tending bar."}
{"text":"This Belgian style craft brewery is top notch.  I am a Pittsburgh transplant living in NYC.  Each trip back home, back with me on the train comes a case of incredibly unique beers to savor and enjoy with my beer geek friends :).  My wife and I are big fans of tart beers and here draai laag excels.  Their flag ship (Aureus) and Belgian styles are also delicious and complex.  7%-9% ABV most of their beers w/o the alcohol taste (amazing).  We have been to the tasting room several times Thu-Sat.  Seems to get more comfy and expansive (outdoor patio) with each visit.  Recently had their Christmas offering St Angus.  Just awesome.  Check them out on Beer Advocate."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visited here while in town for the night because he loves sours. They had a really nice selection! The razmatta was our personal favorite. Cool atmosphere and awesome patio!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday since the name changed, wasn't really sure how this place was related to Draai Laag (if at all). I think the rebranding was just what this place needed. I actually like sour beers but never really was feeling the selection at DL. They had a lot of great options available yesterday, I tried the Talking Trees and another called the Itsy Bitsy something... both were very good. The beer garden is nice, it's partially covered too so that when it started raining (a real downpour) yesterday we were able to wait it out. The beer garden is also dog friendly. They have a decent sized food menu too, mostly sandwiches and tacos. I actually didn't try anything myself but the food my friends had looked great (though it did take a little while to arrive). Definitely plan on visiting this place again."}
{"text":"Great Belgian beer. I think my beer was called \"wild angel\", but it was an excellent Belgian sour.   Decent amount of seating inside, although the lighting could use some work. It makes it almost feel like a retail location rather than I a brewery.   The outdoor Biergarten is lovely. Newly opened, and all the furniture is wood and sturdy. There is a small covered portion of the outdoor area that we were lucky enough to snag in a down pour.   Check this place out. I know we will be back!"}
{"text":"If you like beer, or you don't like beer you need to go here!!! Best Brewery in terms of beer not only in Pittsburgh, but probably in the United States!! These beers are just as good or better than any expensive belgium beer I've drank including: Rodenbach Grand Cru, Bacchus, Kasteel, St. Louis Gueuze Fond Tradition. This is a great place to take people who don't like the normal taste of beer. They offer a wide variety of Belgium beers that are all tasty. Some of the beers they had when I went there were the:  Geestelijke, R2 Koelschip Ale, CRU, Ragnarok and Relic. Their base hops and yeast recipe is phenomenal. It is very consistent through all of the beers. That's a mark of a great brewery and brew master. The reason why that is so important is bc the great taste of this recipie is the foundation of the other tastes added to it. You can tell the good breweries from the bad ones if you get the different types of ingredients and flavors added to the base recipe, and it doesn't taste as good as their flagship beers. Draai Laag does not have this problem. They can almost do no wrong. I would recommend the Cru, Relic, and Geestelijke. Especially the Relic and Geestelijke. I can't wait to try all off them, including the Simon Girty. People have been talking about this beer a lot on here. Some of the best in the world!!"}
{"text":"Great brewery IF you're a sour beer lover. Nice they have a couple non sour options other than that it's a sour beer mecka. Nice ambiance and outdoor area. Hip"}
{"text":"Went here on a rainy Wednesday around 530 and we were the only ones there drinking beer. We were greeted by some very nice folks and promptly served some of the tastiest sour and wild ales I've ever had in my life. Good wild ales, good farmhouses, good sours. In conversation we were given all sorts of interesting information about the brewery and the beers as well as the area which we easily walked to from Bloomfield. If you're in the area and have any interest in fun outside the box beers, head on out because I promise you will have a great time, I look forward to bringing my family and friends here when they visit.  cheers!"}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness. I LOVED this place!  Draai Laag originally popped onto my radar last June at a Philly Beer Week event. I stopped in for one glass and ended up trying all the pours available over the course of a few hours. It was awesome. So, obviously, I knew that if I ever made it across the state, this brewery would be a must.  I visited around 9 p.m. on Thursday with a friend, and the tasting room wasn't too busy. Quiet, dimly lit. Gorgeous outdoor patio with string lights, but thunderstorms rolled in, so we stayed indoors.  Each staff member was super accommodating and friendly. By the time we left at closing, I had purchased a shirt and two bottles of Blue Briar (soooo good! -- blueberry sour), in addition to a flight and delicious pork nachos + brisket tacos off their food menu. Artisan ice cream sandwiches from a local vendor are also available. Highly rec the rhubarb brown sugar!  You really can't go wrong with any of the funky pretty brews here, but my favorite is probably the Red Briar. It's a sour with raspberries, and it's just delightful. Their prices don't break the bank, either. All told, we spent less than $100 -- and that's including the takeaway purchases.  I'll certainly return if I ever find myself in Pittsburgh again. Hope to see more distribution to Philly, too!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to stopping at Draai Laag.  I'm sure glad I did.    All the beers I had were top notch.  Staff is friendly and the whole place has a nice friendly atmosphere.   10/10 would drink again."}
{"text":"If it was just beer I'd give them 5 stars easy. If you're here for beer you will do very well. But now they've started serving food. Now, don't get me wrong I'm all for this new development, but all I wanted was something small, an appetizer maybe, just something lite, and it seems all they have is sandwiches. They look and smell awesome, but if they offered some smaller bites I'd be at 5 stars in a heartbeat. But really their beer is pretty awesome. Eff it I'm giving them 5 anyways."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best, most refined, beer in Pittsburgh if not the entire state. The team really understands refined Belgian and French style beers. The flavors are varied and nuanced, subtle and refined - appropriate for folks who appreciate a more upscale beer experience. The space outside is airy and casual and inside is warm and inviting. Will definitely be returning and following every move at Draai Laag."}
{"text":"The most important thing to know about Draai Laag is that they serve sour beers; you will never find an IPA here. Please know this before going and then writing a 3 star review because you don't like the style. I wouldn't go to the local tea shop and give them a poor rating for not serving coffee. This brewery excels at brewing and serving unique beers. If you like sours, you will like Draai Laag. The staff is extremely friendly, and both the indoor and outdoor spaces are comfortable and inviting. This is a brewery that is outside the box which is refreshing."}
{"text":"BottomLine: Destination: most certainly Faves: food was fun, well thought out and executed. But, dah beeeeeeeeeeer...  Perhaps you are familiar; this guy is twisted, somehow, dropped at birth or something. His ales inspired by Belgian, and they say, French counterparts, are the thing of dreams. Tastes unlike I've had anywhere else, and I've travelled. He gets yeasts from... Well, interesting places (you go ask him, or google it) and the result is extraordinary. Wine, bourbon barrels, hints or more of berries, sour, dry or sweet... All over the place. Complex but it comes off simple; I didn't find myself shaking my head, only enjoying and wanting more, More, MORE.  Careful; octanes tend to be high.  K very much enjoyed the Red Bri'ar, which is only a touch sweeter but right for her palate which is usually more inclined to the sweet. Don't be scared by the \"framboise\" in the description.  LaPienture? A berry sour, but so much more. A craving.  Try these before you commit to a whole one; flights w a bud to find what you like. These are weird in a magnificently wonderful way, but certainly not all will appeal. Ask your server, s/he will take time to discuss w you what will fit your taste.  I want to say this place is pretentious but cannot justify that. Perhaps it's more some of the clientele? The servers are grounded, competent, friendly and otherwise awesome. Warm weather opens their beer garden, but the inside is warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"With differing beer and drink preferences, It's rare my GF and I can find a brewery where we're both satisfied. Despite our conflicting pallets, we both love Draai Laag!   Their beers are very creative, complex, and there's always something new on tap. Yes, Draai Laag makes sour beers, but they're not a typical sour beer that you'd find at Jester King or that's in-style right now. The real magic of Draai Laag is how they utilize various strands of yeast in their beers and how complex they are. You can experience 3 different flavors from just one beer.  I love the 'Brewers Tap Takeover' where they'll have prototypes or experimental batches for a very limited run. It's usually busy in the early afternoons, but it's always a nice and casual environment. However busy, staff are always happy to take time to explain the beers and allow sampling. There's usually enough space that we can bring a small table game to enjoy along with the beers. They serve food, but I wish they had more veg options on their menu."}
{"text":"Draai Laag has a reputation as the best wild and sour beers in the city and they back it up. Although you will pay on average $7 a beer here, the quality speaks for itself. A must stop for beer lovers in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I am a pretty serious Belgian beer fan, so when my husband, our two friends, and I did a brewery crawl in September, I was very excited that Draai Laag would be our first stop.  Since it was a beautiful, cool evening, we got to sit outside on Draai Laag's pretty gravel patio. I told our outgoing waiter/bartender to just make up a sampler for me, and he brought me the R2 Koelschip, Haviken, and Simon Girty. I thought all of the beers were tasty, but my favorite (and the table's favorite actually) was the Simon Girty.  It took us too long to check out Draai Laag and I really hope that we come back sooner than later and don't wait for the weather to turn warm again."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I went to Draai Laag out of confusion because I wanted Mac n' Gold and they were at Grist House and went to the wrong Brewery by mistake (this was pre brews. I swear). But it was a very happy accident! My boyfriend and I got two beer flights and were able to try all 6 of their offering. The sour beers were really tasty. We weren't there for too long but the atmosphere was nice and the bartender was very helpful! I will definitely be stopping back!"}
{"text":"This was hard for me to write but not a big fan of their beers. I used to like their beers quite a bit a couple of years ago especially their farmhouse ale. The outside area is gorgeous and the menu is simple but has great options. Went here with another avid beer drinker on June 2nd with high expectations and left after a sampler flight. All of the beers for the most part are sour which some people like and I tend to as well. Got a beer that tasted like apple cider vinegar. My favorite beers are IPAs and honestly couldn't drink this sour beer. Will probably return in the future as I enjoy supporting local businesses and enjoy beer. Staff was great as well, friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I've been in the brewing industry for a long time.  Back when all these new \"beer snobs\" were drinking Natty Light in their college dorm.  This place is one of the top 3 breweries I have been to in the US, hands down.  We came on a Saturday and it was brewers choice day.  All these random beers they put on tap.  Mellon sour, Berliner Weisse and lambic to name a few.  One was better than the next.  This place main focus is Belgian styles and its refreshing.  Save the piney, chewey IPAs for every other chump and drink some inventive, ORIGINAL beers.  Surprised they have been open for 5 years and I have not been there yet.  I gotta step up my game.  We got there 10 minutes after they opened and it was already busy.  Plenty of friendly servers and bartenders.  All eager to explain the beers and chat ya up.  No food but we brought in wings from Big Shot Bobs and they didn't even bat an eye.  Super cool peoples.  Glad to see they are not taking the elitist, douchebag attitude that most new brewery staff have taken on.  I would describe the \"vibe\" and \"space\" but I'll leave that for the others.  Yet another reason I will be back to Pittsburgh soon..."}
{"text":"My friends LOVE the sours I love the mural on the Wall and my dear friends*  *but not sours, sry"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of many of their fruity lighter brews, but they aren't on the board enough. The seasonality thing (I get the concept = go local), wanting to use fresh fruit from the tri-state area, but that's the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. The dragon fruit brew that was available in July is STUNNING!"}
{"text":"The good: the beers are okay if your aesthetic is sour beers, but be aware - all of the beers have that sour punch, even the porters.   The bad: the service, specifically an owner. I have never been treated this badly by any other establishment in my life, the sheer lack of disregard for their clientele was unacceptable. We went in on a warm night when their \"patio\" was open - their \"patio\" is a gravel parking lot that is connected to their parking lot and just happens to have picnic tables. I brought my dog along because we were going to be outside the entire night - we did not take her in to get our beers, one of us stayed with her outside while the other got drinks. We then sat at a picnic table in a gravel parking lot. I should mention as well, our dog is well behaved she was laying at my feet the entire time, this is not a situation where the dog was out of control, by any means. A woman came up to clear our beer glasses, and told me our dog had to go, even though there were no signs saying our dog couldn't be in what is basically a parking lot. We said okay and my boyfriend went to close out tab, I waited for him while he did this. While we were patiently waiting, this woman, who told me she was an owner, approaches us again and tells me we need to leave immediately and I mentioned that we were just closing our tab and we would be on our way, she then informed me that I needed to leave immediately regardless and stand on the street.   I am not one to break rules and I don't take my dog where she could clearly be an issue (an actual restaurant where zoning and licensing laws apply), however we were sitting in their parking lot giving them our business and to be treated this way was unacceptable, if they had asked in a polite way for us to leave I would not have made a fuss, but it was the tone and the disregard for us even though we were spending money at their establishment. We will never be going back here again, and I would not recommend it to anyone. That being said there is a FANTASTIC brewery around the corner. If you are in millvale and want to go to a good brewery with selection and friendly service - hit up Grist House instead."}
{"text":"Really interesting brewery. No frills, and definitely not a trendy selection. Just good craft beers and a really cool space that encourages hanging out and talking with friends over beers.   There is no kitchen but is catering from Black Shephard Farms.   Definitely worth repeat visits.  So I had to add an extra star as I find myself back here constantly. The general ambiance and accessibility of the place is great for just hanging out, and I find myself craving the beers here. Wish they were open every day!"}
{"text":"Third time in, and while I truly enjoy most of the beer, the service arm is still quite lacking... first  time in we arrived with a party of 8 and were told they were closing early due to low traffic, despite there still being guests and us willing to spend money. This time the small three person staff spent the majority of their time in the back drinking ( each had poured themselves a glass and left)  and laughing while leaving the entire room unattended. This happened over and over as guests continued to have to get up from their tables to ask for more beverages or pay their tabs. New guests experienced the same treatment as they waited empty handed. Hopefully the rebranding makes them \"more approachable\" as described in the Post Gazette article, however, they may need a new, or at the very least retrained staff to serve the desired influx in patrons."}
{"text":"01/03/18  I'm giving this place 4 stars because of the women that accommodated our party of close to 15 people. It's a small space and the norm is to walk up to the bar and order, however, due to our size, the staff was sure to come around the table to take our orders which was very much appreciated! For a lot of us, it was our first time at Draai Laag. They have menus placed around the place that list their food items and beer choices but on the wall is where they list their beers in depth (notes, ABV, etc).  If you love sours this is definitely your place. Unfortunately, I don't like sours at all but that didn't stop me from giving them a try so a beer flight was in order. The flight is 3 5oz. pours of your choice for $12, not bad at all. I went with the Relic (Which is the closest to a hoppy beer you'll get), the Pomegrenade, and Atomic Pomme. I really enjoyed the Relic and didn't care for the rest (like I said, not a sours kinda gal) but my friends loved their choices.  The decor of the place is super cool, looks like it would be a pub in Vikings or GOT. What's nice is that they have outdoor seating with lights that would be perfect in the summer. It's definitely a neat spot to check out if you haven't been!"}
{"text":"It has honestly taken me awhile to rate and review Draai Laag.  I almost wish I could only review and not rate as I am not sure it will be a proper gauge.  Draai Laag like many new Pittsburgh breweries is nestled in the 28 corridor in the hip little town of Millvale.  Draai has a really nice outdoor area and while it's not as expansive as Grist House it is quite classy.  The indoor seating is dimly lit and stylish.  I almost feels like you're stepping into a sleepy old pub in Europe.  The service is always friendly and quick which I do appreciate.  The staff also is definitely excited about Draai's wild style beers and can talk about the styles and techniques.  I have never eaten at Draai, but they usually do a hybrid food truck/caterer which is cool that you can look at a menu at your table. The beers though is what we're here to discuss.  When I first visited Draai Laag 3+ years ago I was awestruck by how cool it was to have a wild, funky, sour house in PGH.  My brother and I ordered samples of everything on the board.  We raved about Draai to friends and family.  We craved the Geestelikke and the Haviken.  I talked to friends in NYC, Boston, and Chicago about how you'll soon see Draai Laag mentioned in the same sentence with Jolly Pumpkin, Wicked Weed, and Jester King.  Over the years however I have been slightly letdown.  Maybe it's my fault for having such lofty expectations, or maybe it's just because they've plateaued.  Sure they're still cranking cool beers like The Plague, Grand Blu, etc, but I just don't taste the excitement.  As I drink their beers now they're muddled together and all taste eerily similar.  I drink the aforementioned brewery's beers often and they're just executed better.  Don't get me wrong I am proud of Draai Laag and like their stuff, I just wish they'd push through to the next level and achieve a little more complexity or even as silly as it sounds simplicity.  In the end I really enjoy Draai Laag.  The atmosphere is great, the beers are very good, and staff is wonderful.  But with the style they could do more.  I also must mention that not being open Sundays really effected my visits, but that is no longer and they now will be open on Sunday!  Parking again is tricky and you'll probably be upsetting a resident of Millvale because of parking infront of their house.  (don't move a folding chair to park). If you like beer, especially weird funky beers give them a try.  It really is a gem in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"What a great selecrion of beers. Wild yeast is a staple here. 100 year old Belgium farm house strains cultivated by the brew masters."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come to this place for a while. I ended up visiting Draii Laag for their beer release event for The Plague. My husband and I ended up coming in when there were less than 100 bottles left, fortunately we were able to snag three after The Keg had kicked.   Anyways the plague was delicious. It is a sour beer with made with fermented berries that was aged on French Oak Petite Sirah barrels. It was strong and delicious.   I also ended up trying out the Cru which was very refreshing and complex.  We ended up taking advantage of nice weather and had our beers outside and noticed that there were two food trucks. The sitting area was plentiful and it was very much a beer garden style decor with a lot of picnic tables and strung up lights. We also befriended the brewery cat, Simon.   The indoor area had a very much a year European feel to it, very cozy and had warm Decor overall. Excellent place to have a beer, I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer drinker, but stop here a few times with family and friends.  They have a nice outside area to sit and enjoy your beer! Occasionally they have food trucks in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Draai Laag is a great brewery to go to if you like sour beer.  My wife and I wanted to try it out even though we aren't fans of sour beer which is why I only gave them 3 stars.  The 3 is because we didn't care for their beer even though it is a great place to hang out and we got really good service from the bartender.   I'm more of a wheat beer type of guy and my wife likes IPA's but were always looking to try something different especially on our brewery tour for the day.  We knew that they had sour beer but we wanted to stop by anyway.     We walked in and sat at the bar.  It was a Wednesday early evening when we arrived.  There were a few people outside and nobody at the bar.  We were greeted by the bartender and he was really nice.  We told him what we like and we weren't used to the type of beer that they brew so he explained it all to us.  He told us what they usually brew and what they had on tap now.  He gave us a lot of different samples to try to see if we could find something that we liked.  We really never did like a beer but we still ordered one drink.  Again it was cool inside and the bartender was really good.  We took our drinks outside and we liked it out there.     If you like sour beer you will absolutely love this place.  Unfortunately we didn't but were are still glad we stopped by."}
{"text":"Draai Laag is picking up the pace of sleepy (and shady) little Millvale. The influx of breweries in Pittsburgh is definitely refreshing as they join the ranks of other hip cities that have hit the microbrew scene. They have a great outdoor seating area and the indoor ambiance is pretty inviting as well. The problem here is that most of their brews are sour. There was only one I was able to actually stomach and that was the Ragnarok. The other issue is that its located right next to the highway. Cool spot, just wish their beer was a little better."}
{"text":"My experience at Draai Laag is nothing short of perfection.My boyfriend and I did two flights and my fave is R2 Koelschip Ale. Also really enjoyed Apples & Pears. Aureus is super good too. Next visit will be a bottle of Simon Girty for me! My only complaint is no growlers just because I collect them in 32 ounce. Something tells me the reason for no growlers is to keep the integrity of the fine product."}
