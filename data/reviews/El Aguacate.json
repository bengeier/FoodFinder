{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Went there looking for a Mexican place close to our house And now we probably eat there 3 times a week. They give out free cheese dip with the chips (a big plus for me!). Everything I've tried there has been excellent. Dona Maria tacos are awesome! Super fresh!   Not only can you get Mexican there, but it also offers an American menu filled with pizzas, cheese steaks, gourmet fries, and more! This place is the bomb. If you haven't tried it yet, you've gotta go!"}
{"text":"Very delicious place to eat at with my family. My family gets our tortas here since it's the only place in town that knowns how to make a delicious torta. The bread they use is the best. It doesn't fall apart and it not soggy. They know how make it hands down. They also make good french fries that come with it. They make great salsa. I love there strawberry lemonade drink. Their rice and beans are also delicious. I have had a few other dishes from their menu that was also good. I still need to go back and try much more. There are so much to choose from on their menu that is another reason I like this place. You can go from wings to an sandwich to pizza or Mexican food all in one place. I call and do takeout orders or dine in sometimes. Again it would be nice to pay at the table and not at the front but I can't recall if it's because it requires a pin at checkout. Anyway the owner is a very nice lovely man. This is a great place to eat at."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh.  The staff is super friendly.  And they're not just Mexican food.  They have a huge menu that probably has something for everyone in your group."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying the new Mexican place in town. Read no reviews before going so I had no idea what to expect. As soon as I walked in, I could tell that this experience was either going to be very good or very bad. It felt like I had just walked into a hole in the wall in old Mexico. Sometimes \"sketch mex.\" can be to far to the \"sketch\" side but this was not the case with El Agua.  Waitress asked me what I wanted to drink and I asked what the drink special of the day was. She replied that I could have the half pitcher of margarita but was unsure when I would receive it as the bartender had to run home and feed the chickens. I declined. The chef then brought chips, two types of salsa and a cheese and beans dip. Exceptional. After perusing the vast menu, I decided on trying the steak fajitas special. I was not disappointed. My only suggestions would be to have a few beers on draft and work on the decor. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The place was good, I can't say that it would be my first stop for mexican food. I think I would try it again. They have a huge selection for everyone. I think the place would do better in a better location"}
{"text":"They're so nice and the food is amazing. Hubby and I get take out all the time. Always delicious and at a good price."}
