{"text":"My husband got the Philly cheese steak wrap and he hated it. I got the burger with an egg and bacon on it. The bacon was hard to bite through, but other than that it was pretty good. We got fried mushrooms and fried onion chips also which were good. 

The worst part of the experience was the service. There was only one other customer there at the time and our service was still terrible. We received no refills and it took forever to get our food and the bill. 

Needless to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is a pity because it has great food (the lobster bisque is the best I've had, and wings are great). The chef is obviously working his butt off, but the service is horrible! You literally have to wait an average of 20 minutes for anything (a side of ranch, water, another beer!) And that's at the bar, forget about it if you sit at a table. If the service was better I'd easily give it 4 stars. It's sad because they host poker on Thursdays, have a juke box and pool tables but the service is enough to make it not worth it. If they're only concerned about keeping locals who will put up with it happy then fine, but if they are looking to bring new people in (which I assume they are because they offer a Zeesaver deal) then they're out of luck due to the bad service. But hey, at least it's consistent."}
{"text":"This bar has changed management and ownership. It is now The Sand Trap. Great looking clean bar and eatery. Check it out.

I got the BBQ Burger with Hot peppers, and the Lobster Soup. My wife had the chicken salad sandwich. Everything was great. They also have a fresh squeezed lemon aid drink that was awesome.

Lots of TVs and a couple pool tables. Great place to eat and hang out."}
