{"text":"Highly disappointed. After a very long day at work  on a Tuesday night at 8:30 pm I stopped here to pick up dinner for the family. They were closed. At 8:30 on a TUESDAY??!!?  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I will not be going back.

The food was not very tasty. I asked for a substitute instead of french fries, and was brought my substitute AND the fries, which I did not eat.  The person I was with ordered a hot sandwich. Another woman in the restaurant ordered the same sandwich, it was brought out to her, and seeing it she did not want it. It was then taken back to the kitchen where it sat, and was brought to the person I was with cold. It was sent back, and a new one made, which was cold too.  I also was never given an item I was supposed to of received with my meal.

The service was friendly, however my waitress kept coughing which was very off putting being around food."}
{"text":"WOW was I disappointed. Service was probably as slow as slow gets. Unorganized and very loud. My impression is that of an upscale diner wanna be. Over priced, very slow service and mediocre food . I got the corned beef on rye that was served on soft rye and fell apart as soon as I picked it up. Needless to say I ate my $10 sandwhich with a fork . Fries didn't come with any sandwich so those were an extra charge, along with hot sauce, extra dressings and anything else you can think of. I'm surprised the ketchup was free. What was once a $10 sandwhich became $13 and did I mention I ate it with a fork?!? I'm not cheap when it comes to dining out, so I think I'm being fare when I say they are way over priced. The food was ok , won't kill you, but won't make you want to go back either. Plenty of other places near by, save your money."}
{"text":"Having had one (and only one) dinner at Rosie's, the former occupant of this building, I had my expectations set fairly low for Vienna Deli.  I'm happy to report, then, that the demons have been exorcized and Vienna Deli serves up a more than passable diner experience.

The Chicken Noodle Soup was decent.  I wasn't crazy about the regular and spinach rotini pasta instead of the traditional wide egg noodles, but the bowl of soup does come with a relatively large amount of noodles and pieces of chicken.  Carrots and celery round out the ingredients in a broth that was (to my surprise) not too watery.

The Wienerschnitzel Special was served topped with a sunny side up egg and together with a potato pancake, green beans, and small cups of sour cream and applesauce.  The schnitzel was made of pork, not veal, and was crisply breaded with a little bit of seasoning for taste.  The egg was a good buffer against the dryness of the meat, and I thought the combo turned out pretty well.  The potato pancake was very good--lightly seasoned and fried just right with only a thin crispy layer on the outside.  On the downside, neither the green beans nor dinner roll were particularly fresh.

For dessert, the server brought me to the dessert counter display which was kind of fun in itself.  The Orange Creamsicle Cheesecake was okay, but something I would pass on for a future visit--it lacked the heartiness (or maybe I mean the cheesiness) one might expect in a cheesecake.  The dessert plate was decorated on the edges with chocolate sauce and whipped cream surrounding the cheesecake, which was a nice touch.  I would probably go for one of the baklavas in the future.

Service was very friendly and accommodating.  My food came out pretty fast--the soup came out immediately and the wienerschnitzel entree was ready to go the second I was done with my soup (which in my hunger I had finished rather quickly).  The interior of the restaurant takes the same general form as Rosie's but with clean, updated diner furniture.  The menu is fairly extensive:  wraps, deli sandwiches, burgers, meat and seafood entrees in addition to breakfast.  Vienna Deli would nicely fill in a void for late night diner food if only it were open later.  In fact, I was pretty surprised that the place was closed by 8:30pm on a weekend.  Nevertheless, the restaurant is a huge improvement over Rosie's and a somewhat surprising solid addition to the many choices in the general vicinity of Great Northern Mall."}
