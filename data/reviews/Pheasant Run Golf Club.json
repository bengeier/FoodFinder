{"text":"Review of this place for a wedding I attended as a guest. Really nice outdoor ceremony, they have a grassy area with a hut/gazebo. With the right lighting during the summer the pictures will be amazing. They have white plastic chairs.... They have an outdoor wooden structure half tent half \"barn\" but not Really a barn, for the dinner reception. It is open to the outside so no air conditioning and bugs if you are lucky. String lights hung on the ceiling. Long head table on a stage and a bar. This place can have a really rugged feel if that's the theme for your wedding. 

Washrooms are inside the golf club right beside the tent and are nice and clean so no worries about a barn washroom. Chairs and linens are worn. But the reception seemed to run smoothly with the help of the staff there. Staff were all nice, courteous and helpful. Food very typical wedding food. Chicken was a bit dry... Of course. Overall I enjoyed my time but I'm not an outdoors person and I didn't enjoy the bugs at night. The parking lot is a little walk down the slope. When we arrived they have staff driving golf carts taking people up the slope but when we left there was no such service. It's a bit out in the countryside so it gets really dark at night. You can see stars!"}

Not only is it an absolutely stunning property, the staff is outstanding. Special thanks to food & beverage manager Lynn for her unparalleled professionalism and expertise... such a joy to work with her and her incredible team! Bartender Alex was very helpful. Can't wait to work with you all again!"}
