{"text":"My wife and I came by for the lunch buffet. I tried the onion pakora, chana masala, naan, vegetable biryani and a mushroom dish. I enjoyed everything I tried, but my favorite of the bunch was the mushroom dish, which was very nicely spiced. I went back for seconds. My wife really liked the cilantro chicken. Everything had a fresh taste.

For dessert, I sampled the carrot gajar halwa. Many Indian restaurants present this as almost a warm soup. The Chutneys version has more of a cake or bread pudding-like consistency, which is delightful. 

The place is cheery and casual. The service was helpful, warm and friendly. The northeast side of Madison doesn't have too many Indian restaurants, so this one is a very welcome addition."}
{"text":"Chutneys is the best Indian buffet I've had in Madison ( or anywhere for that matter). We were out getting our last Christmas gifts at East Town Mall, and wanted Indian. This was very close and a great find. Fresh delicious food, a great Mango lassi and the best Chai I've ever had with lots of fresh ground cardamom. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not enough dishes for vegetarians. We visited the restaurant last Sunday and had very few dishes to eat. Restaurant had no proper ventilation and there was a sea food dish due to which the it was smelling awful.

The restaurant floor was very slippery (due to oil residue or something). So, please watch out as you walk inside because there is a high probability that you might skid and cause serious injury to yourself."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a before-show meal,received excellent service. Server started us with two kinds of wonderful Appetizers. I ordered the Chicken items and Goat Biryani which were perfectly prepared w yummy ingredients. 
Can't wait to go back and sample more of the menu"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Indian food in Madison. My husband and I went there tonight for the first time and it blew me away.

I lived in India for a few years and it's hard to find anything in the US, let alone the Midwest, that compares with Indian food in India. ESPECIALLY south Indian food, which happens to be my favorite.

We had the Gobi Manchurian, the medhu vada, masala dosa, Goan chicken vindaloo, and I had a chai. It. Was. Perfect.

The food is a 10/10. The space is clean, bright, and sparse. The staff are so incredibly kind, helpful, and friendly. We talked a bit and they gave us some free idli, which was divine.

Everything we asked for to be spicy was actually spicy. 

TL;DR, Chutneys is the best new spot in town and definitely the best Indian food you will find in Madison."}
{"text":"Came for the lunch buffet with a group of co workers and was delighted with all the selections and the flavors. The food was absolutely amazing and was continuously replaced with fresh servings. Staff cleared tables quickly and I never had to ask for water. One of our colleagues wasn't willing to pay the $13.00 for the buffet and they weren't making other entrees so the manager offered to get her some soup or appetizer on the house. Friendly clean welcoming atmosphere, I will go again and would gladly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed there was not one mediocre dish on the menu buffet was awesome will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Food quality on a steady decline. Service was good the first two weeks that they were open and mediocre or bad ever since. 

The naan on the buffet are soggy and tired. Sometimes buffet items are labeled and sometimes they are not. Unlabeled food could have created a catastrophe when I ran into peanut chutney and assumed it was tomato or onion chutney. 

By shear luck an employee informed me it was peanut. Since I have a peanut allergy that oversight could have wrecked the rest of my day. 

Take out for dinner was good which is what got them three stars instead of two."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Best Indian Cuisine I've had in the Madison area. Be sure to try them out, and then keep going back because they are so yummy. I know I certainly will!"}
{"text":"Ordered online for take out. Eat Street. While waiting for order, served delicious tea. Watched some cricket. Food was delicious! Chicken tikka, lamb curry, fish curry. Very good.  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and attentive service.  My husband said it's probably the best Indian food he's ever had and we live in Chicago with plenty of options.  We will definitely be back again when we are next in town!"}
{"text":"I visited chutneys, at around 12.45 pm, for its special weekend buffet which was close to 15 items in total. Firstly, i just didn't get that fresh food look at all. Also, I found no great item in the whole buffet. For starters, there were onion bajji and mushroom something. I was highly disappointed with both of them. Naans were below average. I expected at least one good desert but all the three were very average carrot halwa, kesari and something like semya. There was chicken pulao and was over cooked. The only item which was okay is mutton dum biryani. It also lacked that authentic spices, but I understand it was meant for amaricans. So sorry, but very highly disappointed with the food quality."}
{"text":"Don't be swayed by first impressions--the food here is INCREDIBLE. While the exterior may not look like much, you have to come here and try the food. I love the variety at their buffet and the music. 

Great service, and they offer a loyalty discount on your 11th meal.

But seriously: the food is SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Food was very good. The mixed veg pakora was the best I've had. It was very light and delicious (not heavy like some pakora can be.)
Staff was incredibly polite and attentive. Its a great authentic, hole-in-the-wall type spot!"}
{"text":"Great food and lots of it, and they deliver too! I went here after seeing a good review for it in the Isthmus. I got the butter chicken and my friend got the mixed tandoori, and we split some garlic naan. Everything was really good. Entrees are ~$12-19, but the portions are HUGE. Easily two large meals or three small ones. Everything we got was served family style, which is good if you want try several things but can't make it to their buffet, which I definitely want to go back and try because it's supposed to be amazing. The guys waiting on us and bussing the table were super polite, and the waiter even gave us a free sample of dessert. It was some kind of lemon custard bar--very tasty."}
{"text":"Just had a very good dinner at Chutneys, with the family - be warned, though, this is some spicy food (and my wife and I love spicy food)! The staff were helpful in finding dishes for our kids and my 8 year old proclaimed \"Indian food is spicy, flavorful and delicious\" so that was a plus!

The mixed veg. Pakora is unlike any I'be ever had - shredded and light and delicious and not oily. Our Murgh Malai Kabob was excellent, the chicken cooked very well and the veggie biryani was great but very spicy.

The concerns over ventilation though are totally warranted - a couple across the restaurant got a dish that came out steaming and the smoke and spiciness carried over to our table and had us all coughing. 

In all, seems like a legit Indian restaurant with chefs who know what they're doing and some kinks to work out!"}
{"text":"Extremely courteous folks (so lone star which I can't go lower is justified!!) but what a poor substitute for whom they took over from! I assumed as they brought from Fast Biriyani over, they would carry on some of their speciality!! Finally assumed they would at least provide great South Indian food. Boy they amazed me, Indians make much much better food at their homes (yes in Madison too). Replacing Fast Biriyani which was easily the best Biriyani and only decent Indian restaurant on East side, they came with big boots to fill, and as of now they are lost inside the boots!!! Hoping they get their act together soon, and I also get a decent option close to home!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. They add a lot of spice in the food. Its delicious just a heads up."}
{"text":"First visit to this place. The place is focused on South Indian cuisine, and has some Indo Chinese and North Indian entrees too. We had the Mysore Masla dosa and the Mendu (doughnut) vadas. We also had some Tomato soup and Tomato rasam both of which were good.

This place will give competition to the Om Indian Cuisine further down the same road. I think Om is slightly better but it doesn't harm to taste a bit of the different take on the same cuisine, once in a while."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite Indian food place. The food, and service is amazing. Everyone was super nice. Food was delicious as well. 

We went for the lunch buffet. There are vegetarian and Omni options. The food is super fresh and they replace it often.

Service was great. We always had a fresh glass of water and we must have been asked if we liked everything 5 times.

The location was clean and well kept. Everything I had was a medium spice level. However if you have no tolerance for spice, you may want to be careful with what you choose."}
{"text":"My mind is telling me no...but my mouth is telling me yes. I thought I made a mistake trying Chutney's, because frankly, it looks like a take-out joint.  It's not \"nice\", and the buffet is tiny.  But dang, you should see how they use it.  The food is so flavorful!  And on a buffet!!  You don't need choices when you have a couple good dishes.  I liked everything I tried, including both the chicken and the paneer tikka (like I said, not a lot of choices).  They only offered one dessert, but it's one I have never seen before, and it was very tasty.  

During lunch, my only issue was not being offered fresh naan like the other dinners (men?) that came in after me.  I looked dejected, and then they offered me some.  And it was good too, but by then, I was almost done eating.  At $10.50, I don't know if it was the best value in town, but I am looking forward to trying them for dinner take-out."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian by far in the Madison metro. Very authentic and fresh ingredients. The staff are very friendly and attentive. We did take away tonight and it did not disappoint. The staff took the time to wrap the styrofoam boxes in cellophane which kept the freshness in and prevented anything from getting out. The Tandoori chicken is the best we've ever had. The naan, especially the onion naan is awesome. We had a fish dish, fish malabar that was nothing like we've ever had, quite delicious! Its admittedly in an odd place on East Wash, but very much worth the trip! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very lovely staff, food did not taste fresh, tasted like it was reheated - chicken curry and naan. Expensive."}
