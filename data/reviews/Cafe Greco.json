{"text":"Delicious and healthy food. We had the lentil salad, gyro meat, quinoa salad and Caesar salad.....fabulous! Much better than the restaurant that was once in this location. Recommended this to friends and they loved it. Everything prepared fresh! So lucky to find this place."}
{"text":"I have had a yelp account for 4 years now, and this is my first review. I love this place! I've had amazing salads here every single time. They have healthy choices at an affordable price. Must try: tomato slices with mozzarella, and their lentil and kale salad (great dressing too!). A must have: greek club. I am glad to have this place around the corner!"}
{"text":"Loved the food here -- very fresh and healthy!   We had the spanakopita to start, mixed grill (3 skewers: 1 lamb souvlaki, 1 kafla kabob, 1 chicken souvlaki for 15.99) and a dinner w/ falafel, lemon potatoes, grilled veggies and fava beans ....all delish and at a good price!  We'll definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  It feels comfortable and welcoming.  Great Greek food and I love the cold beer.  The owner is very friendly and attentive.  Definitely one of my favorite spots to eat ."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Every dish has a unique quality of ingredients that enhance the dining experience. The atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming. You cannot go wrong with Cafe Greco."}
{"text":"First time there and it was amazing ! Food was delicious and full of flavor !! Most of all very clean :) and lean! Not greasy at all. Customer service was amazing !! Very affordable and great menu choice ! Will come back and will highly recommend ."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in the valley. Authentic and all hand-made in the cafe; including the lavosh bread which is to die for!  I had the Chicken Shawarma wrap w/ roasted dark meat. The meat was roasted in a Greek spice and very good. I only have extremely high positive remarks for the lemon potatoes, falafel croquettes, dolmas, and amazing hummus. The owner hand wraps the dolmas. I love Pita Jungle and frequent there often but this will now be my go-to for Greek food. Good thing for trying new places and not being a creature of habit!"}
{"text":"Best Falafel in the valley. Also great hummus. Order the Falafel in the Lafa (type of sandwich). Lately i got disappointment as the bread oven was broken so no Lafa."}
{"text":"Do you ever just have a craving for a sauce? And then start thinking about the lovely things this sauce could cover?  I had been craving tzatsiki (greek yogurt/cucumbers/garlic/lemon juice) and then it got me thinking I haven't had shawarma this year, and shawarma & tzatsiki go together like peanut butter and jelly, just made for each other. So I knew what I wanted for lunch, just didn't know where to go, at the old office I knew where all the spots were. So like any other Yelper I used the Yelp App to find Greek places in my area.    My Big Fat Greek Restaurant showed and so did a Café Greco, both had the same address, but I also noticed a friend did a review at MBFGR and I asked her where exactly is the place, come to find out, MBFGR is now Café Greco, not sure why the change but rather visit a local place than a franchise anyways.  I ordered the Chicken Shawarma Combo with Greek Salad and Lemon potatoes, came with pita bread & tzatsiki sauce. The plate was colorful when it arrived, the Greek salad had reds, greens, whites showing, potatoes had bright green herbs on them, the chicken was a beautiful yellow color, just had to take the pic of that plate! The food was delish and just what I was craving.  Happy to have found a local Greek place near my job, and it's a cute lil place with a nice outdoor patio area that I look forward to trying out."}
{"text":"I just want to recommend the appetizer combo platter for first-timers.  It has some of the best stuff they serve and is a good way to get to know the place:  - Veggie Moussaka - This really good cabbage stuff - Hummus - Baba - Dolmas with some special spices - Warm, moist pitas  I like the meats, too, but I prefer this stuff.  Of the meats, I think I liked the chicken shawarma best."}
{"text":"I'm Israeli and I know good Humus, Good Falafel, Good shawarma and in general good food, Cafe Greco's Humus, Falafel and Shawarma are simply the best in the valley, I go twice a week! go in and order a chicken shawarma plate with humus fries and salad and see if its not the best you've had!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and pleasingly garlicy - which you want in a Greek restaurant.  I have enjoyed the appetizer combo and the chicken schwarma.  We also had dessert there - delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellant Mediterranean lunch spot. Hard to find someone making fresh bread for your food the minute you order. This is for the wraps I always get the wrap ( lavash) on every order. They have the dough ready to out into a tandoori like oven as you order. ."}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe anyone would give this more than one star. I went into today and had the Greek Burger \"lunch special\" and quinoa spinach salad. Both of were flovorless. My boyrfiend and I walked out without finsihing our meals. This is so far from the best Greek food in the valley. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Ok, so I just did take out for lunch from Cafe Greco and ordered chicken souvlaki with hummus & Greek salad. I only work few minutes away so food should have stayed warm if not hot but when I dug into my food chicken was cold. Chicken was obviously precooked and had been refrigerated for god knows how long because it had grill marks but was dead cold. You think they'll at least warm it up in the microwave or something but NO! They weren't even busy so didn't understand why they couldn't cook it fresh or at least attempt to heat it up. Will never go back to this place again. HELL NO!!!"}
