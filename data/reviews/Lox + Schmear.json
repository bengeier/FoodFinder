{"text":"If you haven't tried it yet... what are our waiting for?! This place is amazing! Super friendly staff, simple and delicious menu and decor, fresh bagels, amazing cream cheese and house smoke salmon... what could be better?!"}
{"text":"I dunno. I'm hesitant to be too honest with my review because I'm excited to have a new place in the area, but my experience wasn't great. First off I thought bagels were a big part of the appeal here; they're not homemade (ok that's fine) and not particularly special. Loblaws Montreal-style are more \"authentic\" imo, but that's okay. What surprised me the most was the five minute monologue from the owner about why she didn't accept debit. I commented that for me, it was a disincentive to come there - feedback for a new business from a longtime neighbourhood resident and customer. Please don't lecture me, at all, but especially in a prolonged manner about your costs to start up etc etc. It's feedback. Secondly, to tell me all about the neighbourhood, which I've lived in for many, many years, and about all the businesses on st clair that only accept cash. It's factually incorrect (starving artist, a competitor maybe shouldn't be your example?) and ffs it is feedback. From a new customer. Annoying. You could just add a charge on or build it into the cost of doing business. It's 2017, there's no actual bank within a block in either direction. If you're going to serve 2 kinds of bagels and have the main attraction be $10 a shot, seems like you might want to listen to your target customer and not talk at them for over 5 minutes about how expensive it is to set up a new business. The bagel was ok. My husband liked the lox but neither of us would go out of our way to make a trip to the bank before going."}
{"text":"Must Try: Bagel + Lox + Cream Cheese (plus your favourite toppings)    Rating: (9/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (10 /10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness   My Experience:   Great little shop that serves up no fuss bagel and lox. You can get a simple and classic, \"OG\" bagel with lox and cream cheese, or go fancy with a \"Fancy Fancy Fancy\" with tomatoes, red onions, capers, cucumbers, alfalfa sprouts and dill.   Everything is customizable, and you can pick and choose your toppings.   Bagels are fresh from St. Urbain, and lox are smoked in house.   Great shop for a no frills and delicious lox + bagel!"}
{"text":"To be honest I didn't really have high expectations when I initially walked into this place , however I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed my bagel. It was made with really fresh ingredients and without anyone one ingredient dominating the others.  Whatever you order, make sure it has lox  Great addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Nice little place. Great to have Montreal-style bagels in the neighbourhood! Good coffee! I like to touch of a free sprig of dill on the cream cheese & lox combo. Welcome!"}
{"text":"Cash only? Really? In 2018?   Something shifty going on there.... undeclared income, at nearly five bucks a bagel seems more than suspect to me.   I can buy a bag of bagels for five bucks, you schmucks!"}
{"text":"Really good, happy it's in the neighbourhood! Only thing is I was expecting the bagel to be toasted (possibly my bad for making the assumption? But I feel like generally you toast breakfast bagels). Anyway not a big deal, next time I'll know to ask for my bagel toasted!"}
{"text":"I'm so obsessed with this place. So much love and care in each one of their sandwiches. It's a very relaxed brunch option in comparison to the usual hoards one might find at an egg-and-pancake brunch spot. And it's queer owned with the same 2 super friendly staff on the floor every day."}
{"text":"Love this place! My usual is a sesame bagel with horseradish schmear, pickled red onion and fresh dill - yum! But I've tried other bagel + schmear + topping combos that have been tasty.   I recently tried their breakfast plate: two eggs how you like it (i got them scrambled), lox, capers, sliced tomato, red onion, a bagel of your choosing with butter or for an extra dollar you can pick a schmear (i recommend paying that extra dollar). I also got a cup of coffee and it all came to $15. Everything tasted delicious together and I was quite full at the end, good value imo. The place also has a chill open vibe if you're looking for a spot to hang with a friend.   A great addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, clean and open. The Ladies working there are very nice.  Took a while for the order. (Cash only) There was only two people working.  One managing the cash and restaurant and one in the kitchen.  Order the #3 fancy fancy (bagel,lox,cream cheese, tomato, onion, capers, cucumber, alfalfa sprouts and fresh dill) Took about  5-10 mins to get my order.  The sandwich was delicious. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"What an absolute gem! My fianc√© and I try to hit up Lox + Schmear at least once a week. He gets the OG and I like The Fancy Fancy. Lev & Milo (hopefully I'm getting this right) are incredibly friendly and clearly have a passion for what they're doing here! If you haven't been, I highly recommend. There's something for everybody and it's all delicious... now I want a fancy"}
{"text":"Lox + Schmear offers a solid bagel product in a modern but non-threatening design setting. It's a good spot for any bageloid meal, or to hang out and have a cup of coffee.  I enjoyed a fully-loaded bagel that surprisingly held together with so many delicious things on it-- lox, cream cheese, tomato, onion, something. I am usually not even a bagel person and gravitate usually toward proper breakfast sandwiches, like those that have eggs and snausages on them, but this is the kind of place that just really makes a damn good lox and cream cheese bagel and I may have to rethink my M.O.  The coffee was quality. And Lev is great!  Cash-only, if that is a dealbreaker for you, and it isn't cheap, but I think everything is expensive."}
{"text":"I love this spot for so many reasons. The sandwiches are stand out - consistently delicious. Every person in the place has a giant smile on their face as they take a bike of their OG or Fancy Fancy. The ingredients are such good quality and the price is right. If you're lucky, you'll come in on a day when the smoker is going, and the whole place is so cozy and fragrant that you'll never want to leave. The staff and owner make the spot feel like community living room where everyone is welcome.  The pickled red onions are divine and the fresh dill is a great touch.  When the tuna bagel is on special I highly reccomend stepping back from the salmon to try it out. It is UNREAL. You have never had tuna salad this good. And with all the toppings, on a warm bagel........... seriously, some magic is happening behind that counter and I don't know what it is, but I don't need to know either. And I'll keep coming back for sure.   A wonderful & welcome addition to our St. Clair West strip!!"}
{"text":"The owner is awesome and attentive to customers and I always get excellent service and high quality food there that is satisfying and delicious! The only reason why it's not 5 stars is because of the prices. I wish they'd introduce a popular bagel with a popular price that won't take away from the costs of running the place, which I'm sure are high for such ventures. It's just that with these prices, it's hard to go often and enjoy a good bagel.   House-smoked Bagels are delicious ! And they put fresh dill if you like. I like! The place is clean, simple in a fresh way, decorated with beautiful pictures depicting family, good for big groups or couples or going by yourself."}
{"text":"This bagel shop is super unique in it's own way,  the menu is super simple and delicious.  I had the fancy fancy bagel and to be honest it was one of the best bagels Iv ever had. Flavours where spot on, and everying was just perfect, there drip coffee is one of a kind as well you have to try it out.  This shop truely has lots of potential to create one of the best bagels in Toronto.  For me it actually already is one of the best bagel shops in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great small business, although a bit pricy for what you get. The house smoked salmon is very good, and the bagels are decent. Love the pictures of a bat-mitzvah, reminds me of going into someone's house."}
