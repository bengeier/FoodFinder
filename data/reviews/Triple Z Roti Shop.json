{"text":"This is the spot for me if I'm in the mood for a roti.   Sure, their hours are unpredictable, but it's all good when you realize that it's a family thing and nothing personal. Try to get there before 7 pm. Your chances of getting food are much better, or give 'em a call.  I love the chicken and lamb rotis. Nice and spicy.   Attitude is warm and welcoming, definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I used to live and go to school in this area. The food was amazing. Good south trini people. Good roti! The shrimp roti was so yummy!! I must visit them again sometime soon."}
{"text":"Didnt know what to expect from this place but it got such good reviews i figured I'd try it. I had the goat roti and it was very good! My first time having goat but definitely won't be my last. The owners were very nice and made sure we were happy!"}
{"text":"Simply Great food. The Roti was fantastic with a nice amount of heat in it. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Friendly Trinidadian people who make a really good roti. I got the beef with hot sauce for $10 flat and it was absolutely delicious. I will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Triple Z came highly recommended to me by a friend but I'm sorry to say that my experience(s) was mediocre at best.  I tried on six separate occasions to grab a roti from Triple Z while in the neighbourhood and only on the sixth try was it actually open for business, despite its \"Hours Of Operation\" sign. The first time they were closed for a private function, times two through five they were closed despite the sign saying otherwise, and on the sixth visit, I couldn't believe my eyes: someone was ACTUALLY WORKING AT THE COUNTER.  I prepared myself for \"an otherworldly experience paralleling onto Gandhi Roti\" (my friend's words) but was left disappointed. I ordered a mixed vegetable roti and it was dry and salty. This is not the saucy sort of roti that you may be used to - it was ALL roti dough with little filling. All I tasted was salt and bread. Not a fan, sadly."}
{"text":"We come here often- the lady who owns the shop makes everything from scratch including the roti which are pillow light and fluffy..the portions are huge,he fillings succulent and juicy..a great meal for under ten bucks   plus she makes a means hot sauce if you want it spicy"}
