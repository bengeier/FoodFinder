{"text":"This is my FAVE all you can eat sushi place. The sushi is great, always fresh and not skimpy slices of fish either. They have many varieties to choose from and lots of tasty  non-sushi items too such as udons, rice dishes, salmon etc etc.  The service is friendly but, as with most all you can eat sushi places I've been to, they forget things we've ordered etc but that's ok, we just order more. The price is good too and I've brought many friends there that now make it their go-to sushi place. Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is all out awesome! This is the second time my partner and  I have been here and Eunice immediately recognized us! She asked where our friend was and remembered little things about our order :) that's just to start,  the food is delicious, it comes to you quickly and it is a great atmosphere! Well deserving of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi, but come during happy hour as it is a little overpriced for the area. Too many other sushi spots around with better pricing for dinner."}
{"text":"There is really not much to say than a great atmosphere and the most courteous service. One of the most innovative things about it is that you get to order from a tablet other than using pen and paper. The food comes almost instantly. Pro-tip if you ever want to go there. Start of by eating anything that doesn't have any rice otherwise your belly would be already packed. My experience was indeed enjoyable and delectable..."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on the good ramen reviews, especially reviews coming from people who say they are ramen lovers, but unfortunately I was disappointed. I guess you can't expect much from ramen in Arizona. Ramen houses in Vegas and Cali are much more authentic.   Had the tonkatsu ramen. Broth was ok, not the rich, flavorful ramen you'd expect a true tonkatsu broth to have. Chasu pork was on the dry side and lacked the flavor of moist, melt in your mouth chasu. Noodles were also just ok. The biggest disappointment was that they served it with egg, but it was HARD boiled and fully cooked through. Again, not what you'd expect when eating real ramen.   Also tried a couple of rolls, but they too were just ok. The rice that was used was too wet, which made the rolls too mushy in texture.   Only reason I gave this place 3 stars is because the service was really good and it feels like a family owned business. Additionally, their pricing is decent."}
{"text":"Awesome place with great atmosphere for family, friends, and/or dates. Food is always fresh and the staff is awesome. They tend to every question you might have and also have have a few suggestions based on what you typically like."}
{"text":"I usually go here on my lunch break and they have nice, fast, friendly service. First time I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box. It was just ok for me. The chicken was a little bit dry but everything else that came with the meal was good. Second time I ordered the shrimp and calamari tempura rolls. For being plain, meaning nothing else added except the seafood and eel sauce on top, they were pretty good. I ended up eating the rest of the rolls later in the day cold, and it was still good. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were excited for this restaurant to open in our neighborhood.  After visiting for dinner on 2/10, we are even more excited.  The food was really good, and service was even better. We thought their spring rolls were one of the best!"}
{"text":"Eh it's sushi so it can't be so bad but I think a lot of sushi buffets are better. Although it's reasonably priced and it comes with dessert, I wouldn't mind going again and again."}
{"text":"I visited Montreal recently and stopped in at this place and I have to say, this is one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in my life. I have no idea how this place is rated as high as it is.   For starters, when we first were seated, we waited almost twenty minutes for someone to come around to serve us water, soy sauce, and explain how the process worked. We were actually just putting on our jackets to leave when the waiter came by and acknowledged us.   We placed our first order and waited about ten minutes before the food came to us. What ended up on the table was an assortment of sushi - none of which I ordered. The server disappeared so quickly that I didn't have a chance to let him know that this wasn't my order. After another five minutes, I managed to flag him down and explain to him that I did not order any of this food. He apologized, took the food away and came back another few minutes later with a few more dishes that also weren't mine. We told him once again that we did not order anything which was brought to us. He then went to the kitchen, returned to our table with a paper and asked us if this paper was our order. After scanning the paper, I told him that this was not our order and that this paper was not ours. He apologized and finally came back with our order.   Almost 40 minutes after I had arrived, I finally got my first round of food. Now the only reason this place isn't getting one star is because the food was delicious. There were a large variety of items on the menu and I was not disappointed in the quality of the taste. However, after the first round of food, we decided to order again. Though we did get the correct order the second time, we had to wait almost 30 minutes before we got it. Now to be fair, they were quite busy. However, there was a large table next to us consisting of eight people and I noticed that they were getting plate after plate of food consistently and quickly. We were only two people and yet we still had to wait for a long time for our food.   Now here's the kicker. Because I had to wait so long, on our third round, we decided to order a whole bunch of food instead of 2-3 dishes at a time because we were sick of waiting such a long time for the food. So we ordered at least 10 dishes, handed the paper to the server and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited OVER AN HOUR. During this time, not a SINGLE server acknowledged us so we didn't have a chance to ask them if our order had somehow been misplaced or lost. I finally was so fed up that I stood up and walked to the opposite side of the restaurant to ask the waiter if he could please check with the kitchen staff regarding the status of our order. He comes back to me a short while later telling me that the kitchen staff did not have any record of our order. We waited almost an hour for food that was never even coming to us! The server asked me if I would like to re-order again and we told him that we would not be re-ordering and we would be leaving.   I ended up having to pay almost $60.00 for twenty pieces of sushi. Oh, and to top it all off, when I was waiting in line to pay, the cashier actually called out to the people BEHIND us in line and told them to pay first. I was not impressed and I will never be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Frist time here, and I was surprise how good the ramen was! the sushi was good as well, reasonable prices since the bowls for the ramen are big! love the casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"First of all The SUSHI IS AMAZING! The reason for the 2 stars is because of a really gross smell the last time my husband and so we're in. The smell was do bad we left without eating and have not been back. This is one of our favorite sushi places. The staff, cooks, sushi chef's, atmosphere are awesome, but the smell made us leave. Im not sure if the foul odor is still there, but if its gone we'll go back!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for the first time and we loved ! We ordered the Las Vegas, South Dakota and New Jersey roll. We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"For the price it's not bad, staff r friendly and fast... i liked their salmon sashimi, some hot food was good as well"}
{"text":"New location for my favourite AYCE sushi in Montreal. A few more options than the one in TMR. Consistently good sushi. Side dishes can be hit or miss sometimes, as can the service. Actually, they need to work on the service overall - it's not bad, they just seem forgetful and a bit disorganized - this goes for both locations. I will still be a regular at either location when I need to get my sushi fix!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service but they will have to give the right orders because we didnt order many rolls with rice but they end up giving other people order with a lot of rolls.  Also soft drink was included on previous visit at this restaurant but seems on last saturdays the waiter say no and it will be charge.  I might going to give a last try and it will be it..."}
{"text":"Sashimi all you can eat even at lunch, one of the few places doing that. And you can order from a tablet. I dont remember the price exactly, but including tips and taxes the lunch all you can eat is around 20 bucks."}
{"text":"Délicieux sushis, parmi les meilleurs que j'ai pu manger à Montréal. Le service est excellent."}
{"text":"Choose wisely when you come here. A lot of yummy food.i love the cumin beef, and their sushi is good too."}
{"text":"Had the spicy ramen here, it was very good and so was the peach Soju and green tea cheesecake."}
{"text":"This was great sushi, and the prices were phenomenal- 14.99 for AYCE lunch, which includes salmon and white tuna sashimi! That is great.  My only beef is that while they dont overstuff with rice (rare for AYCE), they dont give a lot of fish in their rolls. They tend to put more veggies, or tempura bits, rather than the salmon. Also, their service leaves more to be desired.  However, in terms of variety, cleanliness, and quality of their rolls, I was VERY impressed! I will definitely return"}
{"text":"The menu- a do it yourself mismatch of iPad and differently coded paper menu made the ordering process unappetizing. Ordering (where we did a ton of work with Zero input) was absurd."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Everything was fresh and perfectly prepared. Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We love Jade our server and the food was fabulous too. Great casual atmosphere, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, and the food is not much better. Visit this restaurant if you have half a day to waste waiting for your food to arrive... Literally!  After a couple of hours, I got food poisoning. As I am writing this review, I hope not to require hospitalization."}
{"text":"Let's just put it this way, I found a piece of plastic in my sushi roll. I didn't even get an apology or anything offered from the waitress.   A apology would been nice for their mistakes."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi place out there but it will do the job.The staff are quite nice but the meals are well presented but not as tasty."}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh and delicious! Happy hour from 3-6. Place is clean and service fast and friendly! The spring rolls were super yummy as well! I have high standards for sushi and this place didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Went on a friday lunch with some colleagues, the place is well decorated and the and the atmosphere is pretty warm with dim lighting.  There was no music.  The service was appalling, the server was very late  didn't know anything about the menu. He also had trouble understanding what i was telling him in french or english. I ordered spicy basil beef that came with a miso soup.   The flavour wasn't bad but anemic in size. He also served the soup after the dish.  :-/ They do not take interac payments which was disappointing  I wouldn't try this place again"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, service, sashimi is incredible for ayce, very kind service for big groups. Student discount! Nothing more to say. Love it!"}
{"text":"Restaurant à volonté plutôt sympathique! La nourriture est bonne, la place est agréable. Points négatifs : les serveurs sont débordés et il faut demander à plusieurs reprises avant d'avoir un verre d'eau par exemple. L'endroit est bruyant (mais surement du à un groupe qui fêtait un anniversaire en même temps)"}
{"text":"Sushi Plus is one of my favorite restaurants for plenty of reasons! First, it's a local, family owned restaurant - talk about supporting your local businesses, guys! Second, the food is amazing. I always leave here happy and full. And third, the employees are bomb.com. The sushi chefs and kitchen staff work hard to make sure your food is perfect, and the waitresses absolutely go above and beyond to make sure your dining experience is nothing less than exceptional. Eunice is especially my favorite. She's the sweetest thing, and she always remembers what I order. You need to check out this place for yourself! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Food and fresh and clean, very nice deco, kind and friendly stuff, eat all you can with a very reasonable rate, my favourite"}
{"text":"This is a very nice place for date and gathering?I enjoyed the cozy ambiance and the service is great, the waitress is adorable and the food is super tasty?That is best buffet sushi experience so far?Surprised by the Samsung tablet  for odering the food?There are various of appetizers and teppanyaki,Highly recommend the ok chicken that is crispy and flavourous?Also the shrimp in spicy basil sauce is juicy and yummy?This place must be a sushi heaven for the sushi lover?As a big fan of sushi,I would like to say the iced roll and the sunshine is heavenly and delicate?Fresh sashimi and great selection are  attracting me the most?I ate 6 balls of the green tea ice cream that is strong flavor of matcha?  I have been here many times and never be disappointed by the food or the service?It's very worth to try?"}
{"text":"Okay I'm pretty much obsessed with this place now...I've had their spicy Ramen 2 days in a row. I got the Vermont roll as well the other day and it was sooo delicious!!! The servers are very friendly and the food is delicious. This is my new sushi spot. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The 1st time i came here it was relatively quiet, only a handful of tables. The service and food was excellent.  2nd time was last night. It seemed a little busy but far from packed. I noticed a huge difference in service though. I tried to order a beer and was informed that the boss hadn't paid for the liquor permit so alcohol wasn't available on the menu. Ordered the first round of sushi (for 2) and 4 of the items never made it to the table. Next round had 2 items missing. We saw our waiter twice during the whole service, he never really checked in to see how things were. 30 min after ordering dessert we just went to pay the bill at the front because it didn't seem like it was ever going to come. All that being said, the quality of the food is there but the service was definitely lacking"}
{"text":"My go to sushi place. Never busy friendly staff, but gets distracted sometimes and forget to give the check. Also will eat watermelon and offer you some."}
{"text":"Personally, I was not impressed with their sushi. I ordered the 8 pieces with California rolls and my husband got the ramen. The raw fish salmon and their tuna tasted old and fishy. The tuna and salmon were the worst. I might be a little biased since we already have our own sushi spot and this was last minute decision. The ramen was ok. Nothing special and the egg was cold. We left there feeling we don't need to come back. If I could take back time I would have waited to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday lunch.  Had the bimbimbap and a couple sushi rolls.  Hadn't found a place since moving here from SoCal that had a decent or even bimbimbap at all.  This will now be my go to place! Delicious!! The staff is extra friendly and funny too."}
{"text":"This sushi spot is awesome. The rolls are huge, happy hour mon-thur is AMAZING. The service was great. Good spot and great sushi can't wait to try the entrees."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing sushi dinner.  With the rave reviews I was hoping for better.  We ordered the salmon and yellowtail nigiri.  Salmon was chewy but decent but the yellowtail was terrible, very fishy and that is not good for sushi.  The Arizona roll was just average.  A lot of sauce to mask the small amount of salmon.  Sadly I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow the sushi was spectacular and the staff was outstanding. The quantities are ginormous and the cheesecake was delish. Definitely my favorite sushi stop now"}
{"text":"Awesome food , great service.  We had the seafood soup and spicy shrimp.  It was all very delicious.    We plan on returning however I hope they find a way to add a massive amount of fragrant elements to their dining area to help drown out the unpleasant odor that greets you as soon as you walk in."}
{"text":"This super easily accessible by bus and metro resto was decent. By far not my favorite all you can eat sushi resto but it hit the spot.   Among the things i enjoyed at this place was the friendly staff, they were great from begining to end. Another thing that was good was the sushi, it was super fresh!  I found that the ribs had to be the most flavorful dish i tried, but otherwise everything else fell flat. The tempura was just meh, the grilled meats were decent but a tad overcooked. All in all this place is an average all you can eat sushi place  There wasn't necessarily anything bad about this place, but it was simply mediocre and although the staff was really friendly they forgot about 5-6 of our items.  Would i go back? Maybe if i were in the area."}
{"text":"Comment manger bien plus qu'à sa faim! Les buffet sont traitres parfois...  Pour un prix abordable (25$ sans compter les taxes), vous avez à votre portée une panoplie de sushis, sashimis, etc. Déguster sans compter! Très bonne cuisine, savoureuse. L'arrière du restaurant, la cuisine, laisse à désirer, mais la nourriture y semble pourtant fraîche! Je me suis régalée, malgré la vue des coulisses du restaurant."}
{"text":"they offer a large menu selection but the orders were hit or miss.. (i recommend the pad thai, shrimp dumplings, and shrimp/crab tempura!)  the sushi was subpar and could be improved greatly in terms of the ingredient quality.  the ordering system/pictures could also be improved, to appear more high quality and professional.  given the high price (~$30 for dinner) this was a disappointing meal.. but this place has potential!"}
{"text":"Food was very mediocre.  I wanna ask myself if they really wanted to give me my sushi because they were very small, looks cheap and looks like they were samples offered by a big wholesale warehouse store.  It's so overrated, I felt that I was so shortchanged.   Food doesn't look anything close to what's on the tablet menu, they look like leftovers, looks old and unappealing.    It was a very regretful visit."}
{"text":"Meilleur restaurant sushi à volonté où je suis allé jusqu'à maintenant à Montréal. Le service est rapide , on peut y être servi en français comme en anglais même si les serveurs sont asiatiques. De plus , le menu sur la tablette et parfait puisqu'on peut y voir des images des plats et commander facilement."}
{"text":"As a student, finding reasonable prices for lunch is always a plus. This place is quite far out of downtown Montreal if you don't have a car, but it is worth the trek. Good quality and fresh sushi and a great price of 13.99 for the all-you-can-eat menu (plus a 10% student discount!) Recommend trying the red bean ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"It's a good place to try out. Their 13$ all you can eat in the afternoon is decent but a little too salty for my taste. The service is slightly slow and they are under staffed for what they promote. There desert (ice cream) is very good, try red bean ice cream you will not regret it, unless your allergic."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first visit here. The sushi chef was lovely & very caring. Happy hour prices are terrific & the times are generous. Service is attentive without being intrusive. This is a family business that deserves loyal patronage. I will definitely be coming back whenever in the area."}
{"text":"The food and service is really good. We came here about a month ago and tried again just the other day...we walked in and it smelled so bad like sewage that we could not stay. We asked the waitress if she knew why it smelled so bad and she said that the other businesses there have complained and the management replaced the vents to \"fix it\" They need to hound management, because its not a vent problem. It smelled like an outhouse. I just couldnt stomach it. Based off the reviews, im wondering if its something that happens off and on because a month ago when we went, it didnt smell- but other reviews say it did. They need to fix it, I cant eat in an outhouse no matter how much I like the food or service."}
{"text":"Good sushi but got overcharged by Jade ordered some things off happy hour menu  to go and she charged me twice as much because it was to go when I asked why she said because it was to go my $3.00 spring rolls are now $6.50 as well as other items bill was $70.00  for 3 happy hour rolls edamame and tempura  and a saki bill should have been around $45.00 when I asked she just kind of laughed . Will not go back after searching for the Old K Sushi staff sorry I found them again will not go back now .Check your bill before you pay it for extra charges..."}
{"text":"The Texas roll and tonkatsu ramen is amaze!I took my kids out here after school and we had such a great time!The place is cute and clean and the service was great!The servers were so nice and the food came super fast!Everything is served in very big portions and it was super affordable!"}
{"text":"So glad to have found this place. The ramen was good, the sushi was good, and the yellow tail sashimi was terrific. The happy our sushi had good prices. We will be eating here again."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Authentic noodle and ramen bowls. I'm Korean so I appreciate all the flavor. And the spice!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when we had to wait almost 3 hours at Simon Med. We tried out a few different rolls and they were all delish. Owners were happy we were there and made sure we enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"We got our food through one of the food delivery services. Normally they have been very disappointing. Sushi Plus was the exception. Everything was delicious! Can't wait to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Happy hour from 3 to 6 Monday to friday.  The service and the sushi is outstanding. It's worth a try if you haven't been here."}
{"text":"Very clean very open fast service good food we will be back. Not to mention happy hour is every Monday through Thursday which makes it even a better deal."}
{"text":"Great place, not the best sushi I ate and the hot tea is not as good as the one at cote des neiges sushi plus. The sashimi is the same but I didn't really like the Makis. The price is good for an all you can eat sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to A LOT of all you can eat sushi places around Montreal, and while the food at Sushi plus is pretty good, the service is awfully poor. Slow, wrong items being brought to table. Disappointing really."}
{"text":"The rolls were really good. Service was great. They're very nice and attentive. The Ramen is not worth the price in my opinion. I had the tonkatsu Ramen.  For the price, I'll only be talking about the rolls, I think it's worth it. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sushi Plus is #1! Great service from Jade and the entire staff. I love that Jade will tell you like it is when you ask about the menu. I want to know what I'm getting! We always love coming here not only for the food but for the experience."}
{"text":"Friendly service, wide variety of options. My daughter mentioned there was a new sushi place she wanted to try. We were in the area and decided to stop for a snack. We discovered that Sushi Chef Ki and his son had joined this restaurant shortly after they opened February '17.   Sushi Plus offered a 2 for $9.95 roll offer during happy hour. We tried the unagi roll and the the albacore tuna roll. The flavors were good. However, the unagi roll was rolled a little loose.   What really intrigued us was the the for broth bases they offered with their ramen: shoyu, pork, spicy chicken and miso. We cannot wait come back and try their ramen. They also offer bibimbap and soonduku.   The proprietors were friendly and the food was tasty. We will be back to try the other offerings!"}
{"text":"We have only had ramen here and we loved it. We had the tonkotsu ramen but our favorite was the spicy ramen. Great flavor and good service we will be back"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My wife and I went here as a pre celebration for father's day and we were very pleased with the service. We ordered 2 rolls from the state list and it was very fresh! The spicy ramen was perfect! It was the perfect level of spice. We will definitely be recommending this to our friends and family and also coming back ourselves!"}
{"text":"I had the lunch bowel with chicken..it was very good...very tasty, not too salty or oily.  The rice cooked just right,,,,I will have it again.  Also, liked the miso soup.  Do give it a try."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is the sashimi offered at lunch time, the overall selection is pretty great.  The rice is the maki rolls is not amazing, but it does the job.  This location has taken over the Beaumont location as it's better overall. They both have ipads, but this one offers outside seating.   There is some inconsistency, General Tao was amazing first time, but repulsive the second"}
{"text":"They've really win me over for a few reasons  Sashimi for lunch. 2-3 types  Very friendly service and the iPad ordering The quality of the rice in the maki rolls has been really solid the last few visits   Lovin' it"}
{"text":"This place is very great at custom made sushi. They make up all these different names for their sushi but don't get scared of the names because allot of their sushi is very tasty and it's mainly california rolls, spicy tuna, and salmon mixed with other stuff.   Service is great and they get to the point. Their happy hour is great if you want a quick sushi fix."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Sushi Plus for just over 6 months now, but I wanted to wait before writing my review. Their all-you-can-eat lunch menu is decently priced, and their service is great but their food quality is a little inconsistent. I've only come here during lunch hours, so my review will only reflect my experience during those times.  The restaurant is quite spacious, with a warm atmosphere and dim lighting. Their menu is mostly westernized sushi, with some traditional chinese dim-sum mixed in.   You order on tablets, and the service is usually very fast. They have a good variety of sushi and other dishes, but the food quality is very inconsistent. Sometimes their soups are delicious and scalding hot, sometimes they are lukewarm and flavorless. Their sashimi is not very fresh, and cut into different thicknesses every time I come here. Their sushi, however, is quite good! I really like their Sushi Plus roll--definitely give that one a try.  For an all you can eat lunch menu priced around $20, you're getting what you pay for. Coming from Toronto, I found that the service is good, but the food leaves a lot to be desired.   P.S Try their hot and sour spicy soup!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in montreal! So cheap for all you can eat and sooo good :) i come here all the time. Staff is very nice too!!"}
{"text":"Best All You Can Eat Sushi in Montreal! I've tried almost all the AYCE sushi locations montreal and this one is by far the best! Fresh fish, good service, no long waits for food. Couldn't ask for any more. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi, decent service but not as good as the Cote Des Neiges Sushi Plus location. Go to that one instead!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I had the spicy ramen - it was delicious. My wife had a few sushi rolls and all were quite good. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Sooo delish! My new sushi spot! Everything from the garlic edamame to the yellowtail sashimi ..."}
{"text":"Since we came here for sushi, and were terribly disappointed, it'll be a one star for now. Let me explain; At a traditional sushi restaurant, eating Omakase means \"Chef's choice\" which means you let the chef create whatever they desire, in order to give you the best sushi experience. That does not necessarily mean expensive, but you will get to try maybe some new fish that is not currently on the menu or rolls that are unique and custom. It has been at least 10 years or more since I ordered off a sushi menu, and ordering Omakase helps me to appreciate the sushi offered, as well as let the chef know we trust them to give us the best sushi experience. When I sat down at this new sushi restaurant, the waitress which seemed to be an older Japanese lady scoffed when I told her Omakase. She told me flat out that every other sushi restaurant had been lying to me and that Omakase was not real. Then they called over the chef which seemed to be a very young American guy, again not a problem, but he sad that the reason they don't do Omakase is because they don't have expensive enough fish; again obviously in a sushi restaurant this sushi chef does not understand what Omakase is. Finally the other waitress a young Asian girl mention that the reason they don't do Omakase was because if they dialed up a roll for $16 people would freak out. Frankly none of these three people understood what Sushi tradition really is; Sushi is not about just feeding your belly, it's about enjoying the art form of how they put the sushi together. If it's a matter of just feeding my belly, trust me I can go to anywhere else and get that done. It's a shame too, because I really wanted to give this new place an opportunity to maybe be one of my stopping points."}
{"text":"En faisant des recherches sur Yelp (et sur d'autres sites aussi mais shut), je cherchais le meilleur endroit de sushi à volonté à Montréal (et quand je parle de Montréal..je ne parle pas de Kirkland, West Island et des endroits où le métro ne se rend pas..). Selon mes recherches, c'était le Sushi Plus. En plus, seulement 13 minutes de chez moi en auto..et comme ma date Tinder a une auto et c'est lui qui m'accompagnait, c'était très bien. Il y a beaucoup de place de stationnement et le métro Acadie est à proximité pour les gens en BMW (bus, metro, walk).  Donc, nous sommes arrivé au resto, je m'attendais à quelque chose de plus grand..mais bref ce n'est pas ça l'important. Nous avons attendu un petit 3 minutes avant qu'on nous assigne une place.    Une fois assis, on voit les \"serveurs\" passer..mais ce sont plutôt des préposés à l'eau ou bien à apporter la nourriture. Après une dizaine de minutes, je demande de l'eau. Une autre fille nous apporte un Ipad, mais sans aucune explication. Le Ipad est sale..tsé le nettoyer avant de le passer à un autre client ne ferai pas de tord. Vu que je ne connais pas ben ben les Ipad (je suis team android) et le gars avec moi aussi..on était un tout petit peu perfu quand l'app ce fermait.   C'est ben cool de commander par Ipad dans un à volonté WELCOME TO 2018 tsé..tu peux voir ce que tu as commander comme il faut, voir l'historique, voir le prix admettons si tu prends de la boisson et faut payer en plus de ton repas..pour tout cela c'est nice. Par contre, les images de sushis ne sont pas très claires..Il faut tapper comme 2 fois pour voir ce qu'on les sushis. Aussi, pour voir mieux sur le Ipad, vous êtes casiment mieux de vous assoir côte à côte. Bref, nous avons commander...mais il fallait aller appuyer sur un autre onglet order confirmation..quelque chose de même...on a quand même été nono et attendu comme 15 minutes avant qu'on dise que c'est long...Finalement, on a pu arrêter une serveuse et lui demander..elle nous a expliqué..Bref. La nourriture est arrivé très vite..on finissait un plat et un autre arrivait. Mais figurez-vous donc que même avec la technologie, ils avaient oublié un plat de Kamikaze.   Bref, tout était délicieux..à part le Octopus bbq...il n'était pas tendre du tout et pas trop frais au goût.   À notre deuxième commande...on était plus capable de manger...oups...il nous restait 7 sushis on assumait de les payer et on voulait les apporter..mais personne n'est venu nous voir et le plat a été ramasser. On a pas mentionné nos 7 sushis perdus, en croyant qu'ils allaient se passer le mot et nous faire payer 7$ de plus...mais non! Bref, les sushis sont excellent..mais le service est à chi***..comme dirait Gordon Ramsay. Je déconseille d'aller en groupe car devant nous il y avait un groupe de 10 séparé sur 3 tables...et plus loin aussi un groupe de 8 sur 2 tables de 4."}
{"text":"Tasty and affordable, though not a great spot for picky kids like mine :)  The menu is a bit overwhelming, with \"50 rolls for 50 states\" in addition to the array of sushi, sashimi, entrees, appetizers, and drinks. I love variety, but when handed 4 separate menus, it can be hard to process.  That said, the rolls were delicious, tempura shrimp and calamari were amazing, and the staff were very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Is this gourmet, life changing sushi? Heck no, it's AYCE and I think people should keep that in mind. A lot of reviewers seem to expect fine Asian dining at a fraction of the cost here, so if that's what you're hoping for, you'll be disappointed. Nonetheless, it's the best AYCE I've been to in Montreal. Yes, sometimes the rolls arent rolled tightly enough, so you end up with rice falling on your plate, but again, it's AYCE, so chill out and order another piece if that's the case. Would I like to see more variety in terms of fish offered? Sure, but again, it's AYCE and I don't see any other place in Montreal that's AYCE offering more. I've been there more times than I can count, and while I originally balked at going to an AYCE sushi place for fear of low quality and food poisoning, I can say that I've never gotten sick (and yes, I've already been sick several times from bad sushi, twice at the \"chic\" Takara downtown) and thoroughly enjoy my visits. Yes, service can be a bit slow, but if you make sure your hand is seen or your voice is heard once in a while, you'll get served promptly. The rose sushi, the futomaki rolls in general, the cumin beef, chicken yakitori, octopus balls and the shrimp tempura are all very tasty. In fact, it's a steal of a deal if someone has a thing for shrimp tempura, because at regular restaurants, you'd be paying the $25 price for about six pieces of shrimp tempura and some veggie tempura, not the unlimited amount you can eat here. And it's good shrimp tempura. Yes, occasionally, the oil isn't hot enough so the tempura comes out slightly greasy, but 8 times out of 10, it's piping hot and super crisp like it should be! Most regular Asian restaurants don't make it this well. I also enjoy eating the seaweed salad, and one portion from here would set you back $5-6 at a non-AYCE. Unlimited decent tea, sometimes bordering on excellent when we get a particularly roasty pot. So basically, what I'm trying to say is that if you know what you like, have a large appetite and want cheap beer or sake on the side, this is the place. Stop judging this resto with unrealistic standards."}
{"text":"My go to if I needed to splurge during my lunch time during work. They have ordered a variety of sushi, if you are a first timer, they are so friendly and helpful. People have said the prices are pricey. I have to disagree, the sushi are over the top, you can get takeout as well. Suggestion: Call before you drive to sushi plus, it can be a bit of a wait, the place is very popular, no doubt."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by the interaction I had with some of the staff but the food was delicious. The place was nice and clean. I highly recommend the teriyaki beef. I will definitely be back to try other things I saw on the menu.     Update: tonight's service was much better and the food was still very delicious. Definitely went from a 4 to a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"This was great. Happy hour all day. Prices affordable. 4 rolls and dumplings and 2 sodas was $41. We had the shrimp dumplings, Florida roll,  California roll, new Hampshire roll and shrimp tempora roll. Very delicious!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! I come here often and I've always been satisfied with the excellent food, price, and service! My favorite is the new Mexico roll"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great prices and I found out this place is owned by my long lost favorite sushi chef!"}
{"text":"Without any exaggeration- this place serves some of the worst sushi I have ever eaten. Given the fact that we have tried many other AYCE sushi places as well as the finer establishments over the years, we went with low expectations to give this place a chance.  We were even terribly disappointed after setting the bar quite low.   The sushi is extremely thin and the rice is so poorly made it's as though it was the chef's first day making it. Everything is extremely salty and the spicy salmon/tuna have perhaps a minute trace of meat (we didn't see or taste any) and consists wholly of the rice crispies. The only saving grace was the small slices of fried banana, even the ice-cream was obviously low quality.  If you have any problems with blood pressure- the sodium content here will send your pulse through the roof.  Skip this place- there are far better AYCE sushi places. I am very surprised why it received any favourable ratings."}
{"text":"I just read that they were fined $1500 because of mouse droppings on food and cutlery. People got sick and are a repeat offender. Eaters beware. Hate when people play with your trust."}
{"text":"I went to Sushi Plus for a place to relax and enjoy my food. This place definitely hit the spot with the awesome customer service and relaxing decor. The food was a plus as I bought spicy shrimp tempura and shrimp tempura and Shoyu Ramen ! Ramen was one of the best I've tasted with the pork, egg  and ramen noodles!"}
{"text":"Nice interior design and very clean place. Very friendly service. You order via tablet which is quite convenient. Overall expectations were not so high since it is AYCE and you get what you pay for.   SASHIMI Was OK. Tried several ones and they were not bad  SUSHI Above average. Liked the rice that was well prepared and still warm.    ROLLS  Also a little warm rice. Ok ratio between rice and stuffing. Above average   DUMPLINGS  Definitely Ok.   Overall I can say that this is good value for money."}
{"text":"I visited here twice. The first time we ordered jjampong and tangsuyuk. (Korean spicy seafood noodle soup and sweet and sour pork) I would personally recommend getting it plain with sauce on the side for the sweet and sour pork. As a Korean myself, it wasn't the best - but it was close enough for my crave.  The second time I was craving for some good Yaki Udon. I asked the server if they could make it spicy. She mentioned that it wouldn't taste good if it was made that way, I asked if the cook could just add some spice to it when cooking. I have ordered Yaki Udon from many establishments and didn't see why she would suggest that - plus knowing that they are Korean established. When the noodles came out it was not done as I requested. As she was dropping the food down she softly said \"they did not make it spicy,\" with an Oops with a look towards the kitchen she told me she will just bring me the spicy sauce. Cool. I proceeded to take the first bite. Grrrrrr...It was way too salty. I told myself forget the spicy sauce because if I added the sauce, it will just be adding more saltiness. I was hungry but I was never asked if I liked my food or not, she just kinda left us hanging (not sure because she was embarrassed of not getting my order right) the whole time until she asked me if we were ready for our check - my plate was nearly untouched but no question of how was it or was there any problem. I kinda did not bother anymore and just asked for a box hoping I would bring this home and try to reduce the saltiness down with some water and cook it better myself.  I never tried their sushi or sashimi so I cannot say about it. But I hope for a little change to the service and hospitality. For now, I rather not return."}
{"text":"Sushi was really disappointing. I ordered the cape cod and the shrimp tasted old. To make matters worse they clearly gave me old sushi roll that had been sitting in the fridge all day. The rice tasted super hard. It's insulting. I would never order from here again.   The salmon sashimi at least tasted adequately fresh. The miso soup was pretty standard."}
{"text":"So....I should have taken pictures of the food I had at lunch, I'm very sorry that I didn't because this was probably the best tasting AYCE sushi I've had.  While the salmon sashimi pieces were probably half the size of standard sashimi portions, they were fresh, and that's what really matters. Lunch has fewer choices than dinner, but everyone at the table found things they liked and we stuffed ourselves to the brim (though we managed to squeeze in some red bean and green tea ice cream). The tempura shrimp were crisp and one of my favorite items. In case you were curious, apparently the maki rolls are larger at this location than the original."}
{"text":"A new sushi place has popped up in Glendale and it's stupendous! My friends and I dropped in during their soft opening and it didn't dissappoint.  They offer a wonderful selection of sushi, ramen, curry, and other Asian inspired eats.  Happy Hour is all day on monday through thursday and 3 to 6 on fridays through sunday, they offer some good eats at a wonderful discount.   They offer sashimi as well as specialty rolls. The specialty rolls are named after states and that means...50 choices!!!! We ordered the spicy ramen, gyoza, spring rolls, Arizona roll, Nevada roll, Kansas a Iowa roll. All the sushi was fresh and came in decent sized portions. The Nevada roll, aka Vegas roll was my favorite. The eel was fresh and the unagi sauce was perfection. The spring rolls are crispy goodness and we could not stop eating them. The arizona roll was spicy, at least for me but there are of spicy options for you spice lovers.  There's tons of free parking and the hours are flexible. The wait staff are attentive, kind and made us feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Its a good place to go. Good food. Lunch time bento box is worth the price. All you can eat has a good selection."}
{"text":"First time here. It was a fantastic experience!  Food was great and the service was excellent. Jade is a firecracker. She defiantly made our experience better. Looking forward to coming back as soon as it can. My new favorite sushi spot."}
{"text":"Been here couple times for lunch. Great service, sushi choices galore. I've tried quite a bit of the menu and would recommend all of it. They have a specialty roll for every state. Along with a kitchen menu and normal sushi menu items. Can't go wrong. Customer service is great, they will help you through the menu if you have questions. Definitely my new sushi hot spot!"}
{"text":"This is our new sushi spot. Staff is super friendly and fun. Minor adjustments to my meal were no problem. Everything is very fresh and delicious. No mochi, but the green tea ice cream is to die for."}
{"text":"Made a quick decision to stop by and try this new place nearby my work.. What a great decision! Had some iced green tea and ordered the curry chicken lunch bowl.. It came with a miso soup which was pretty tasty.. We also ordered some nigiri, albacore, scallop, and masago.. We also ordered the Nebraska and Michigan roll.. This place a roll for each state.. Can't wait to try them all.. Such a great decision to stop by.. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good little place with decent food. The appetizers are great especially the calamari. The decor and staff are very nice. Not the best sushi I have had but, not bad by any means."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing!! Customer service was THE BEST and everything we ate was delicious. Our server was so sweet, attentive and even taught my 2 1/2 year old how to use chopsticks (with the cheaters!). They have a great happy hour with lots of choices. The place is spotless and doesn't smell like fish! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I was craving ramen for weeks! Just moved to the area so looking for a good sushi/ramen place, this popped up and figured \"must try\". Name may be generic but don't let it fool you! I got the Tonkatsu Ramen and a sushi roll - I was in heaven!! It was sooo amazing and the ladies working there were so sweet! Jade helped us out and she was amazing! Definitely going here again and I can't wait."}
{"text":"This place was mediocre but the server Jade really makes this restaurant! The sushi was ok, the Arizona roll was really good but I ordered the tonktsu ramen and it wasn't good at all. The broth looked authentic but when I tasted it was kinda watered down. I'm use to having spinach in my ramen but they had broccoli instead."}
{"text":"The sushi and service are amazing. We came in on Sunday during Happy Hour (3pm-6pm) and ordered miso soup, shrimp tempura, gyoza, and 4 sushi rolls. The sushi was freshly made, the tempura had the perfect crunchy outer layer, and the gyoza was sufficiently filled with meat. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because we couldn't finish all the delicious food; the portions were large. I wish we would've been warned ahead of time about ordering too much for just 2 people! However, for all that food we spent less than $40. Our server Jade was super sweet and witty. We had a great conversation with her after our meal. Stop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great sushi, no frozen fish. Fast service. Good prices, especially happy hour! Miso soup and green tea is delicious  my new favorite sushi  place!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The sushi and quality of the food here exceeds expectations, might even be the best in AZ. P.s all day happy hour Monday - Thursday :)"}
{"text":"This was a great sushi place ... the rolls are named by state the sashimi was fresh edamame was delicious. They were fast and good service will be nack"}
{"text":"This place is incredible..our food was delicious..with.large sushi selection..50+  and a fair sized menu..it would be hard to get bored with the selection. With excellent food and service we will be back and will be sure to tell everyone we know about this place.."}
{"text":"I had the most horrible experience here.  I honestly don't understand how they are getting four and a half stars. We walked in and the place smells so bad, and even though it does, we still manage to stay and give it a try. The lady taking our order has such bad attitude. So Tran D had ordered a bowl of Udon and wanted to order a sushi roll for the table and she pretty much fat shamed her.   \"I dont know how much you eat but our bowls are huge.\"  After a nasty stare, Tran decided to take off the roll, already unhappy with how she was being treated.  She was also very rude to my friend Simon and  not doing her job explaining to my friend what proteins he could add to his ramen, but instead told him to go back in and read it himself. What's her job supposed to be as a waitress?"}
{"text":"It's rare to find a good sushi spot in Arizona.  I'm from San Diego and there are dozens of great places.  Sushi plus exceeded my expectations.  The food was fresh, amazingly tasty and the establishment is really clean.... I mean like too clean hahah.  I enjoyed the various sushi rolls, and you would think that it was there specialty.... but this place is like a jack of all trades.  My wife got some Ramen, and the broth was incredible.  The broth was rich in flavor, but really really lite and not heavy like a lot of other places.  The staff are very friendly, and very attentive.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sushi was great! In the area and needed to eat in a hurry. Great service, great food, clean little spot! Def will go back"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to visit based on previous reviews as we are ramen lovers.   Holy shit, it was amazing. I had the miso ramen and my wife had the tonkatsu ramen. The broths in each were superb. That and they noodle and toppings amount were very generous. They were easily a full meal. Also, the pork is so savory and melt in your mouth good.   I also had a spicy California roll, spicy tuna roll and regular tuna roll. Each were large, but not over powering. The blend of rice, seaweed and fish (as well as other fillers) was spot on. Nothing was overshadowing another ingredient. They were delish.   The waitress was a hot shit. She joked with us and gave us just enough sass. It was hilarious and endearing.   All in all, awesome experience and wonderful food. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly for sushi on the west area this is soo good! Great ramen, and bento boxes are really yummy! Definitely somewhere you should try out"}
{"text":"Very nice place, one of the best all you can eat sushi place in Montreal."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and I honestly don't get why it's only a 3/5 on here. For a AYCE I can honestly say that the quality is pretty good if you compare around. I like the fact that You order off an iPad.  They have an extensive menu with a nice selection of Makis. I usually go for sashimi, Makis and some sides like the chicken yakitori, shrimp tempura and beef rib. We always end the show with some green tea ice cream.  I had no issue whatsoever with the service  I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a decent AYCE."}
{"text":"Holy balls you guys, this place is fucking phenomenal! First time since the old Chinese place closed and it is now going to be a weekly spot. First  the customer service was incredible. Second we ordered the bento boxes and they were so delicious. Great food, amazing customer service and you need to get there and be amazed too!"}
{"text":"Sushi Plus is a great place to grab quality sushi at an affordable price. The food is always fresh, flavorful and tasty. The sushi is usually ready in 10-15 minutes when placing an order to go. The soups and noodles are great as well. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. Definitely one of my favorite sushi places in Glendale!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  I ordered Vegas rolls and spicy miso ramen. Both were very good and mouth watering.   The staff were all extremely nice and made us feel like we're at home.   At last we tried the deep fried ice cream for desert, it's a little different but definitely worth it.  Overall I was very pleased with my dinner and will be back"}
{"text":"Sushi plus cdn has a special place in my heart. When i used to live on cote des neiges , my roomies and i would go quite often. Its so modern i mean ordering on ipads is so cool & the fact that they have more than just sushi and maki on the menu makes me a happy camper. Yes i love fries and order them shamelessly plus they have a 10% off for students AMAZING :)"}
{"text":"Sushi à volonté pour le lunch : les produits sont frais et le choix est varié. Le service est correct."}
{"text":"We came here with our meet up group and we were kind of surprised that there were not more people there. This turned out to be a good thing as our group was quite large so we happily had the waitress to ourselves. They have a really good happy hour menu in which several of the more common rolls are discounted. Sushi is their main stay and they boast of having 50 various kinds each being named after a state. Hubby and I ordered the Connecticut, the Kansas, and the Louisiana. All were very good; however our hands down favorite was the Louisiana. We both really loved the sauce that it was served with. The gentleman sitting next to me had the Calamari Tempura and it looked so good. Next time I will for sure order that! The service was really good and she even split all of our checks for us. Prices were really reasonable and it is a place where I would like to return to in the near future."}
{"text":"Customer service is great!! The food is pretty good too. My husband gets the sushi and I get the ramen and we haven't been let down yet"}
{"text":"They had forgotten to bring multiple orders. We had to ask multiple times for them, especially for the octopus balls I had ordered at the end."}
{"text":"Samedi soir et le restaurant est plein. Nous sommes un groupe de 10 La commande se passe par une tablette que les convives se passent après chaque commande. Les plats arrivent un peu n'importe comment devant n'importe qui à la table. Nous devons constamment se passer les plats que d'autres à la table ont commandés. Le service parcontre est très rapide. La nourriture est pas mal. La soupe aigre douce etait très bonne. Pour ce qui est du poulet general Tao, il etait froid. Pas tiede mais froid. Les sushis et Nigiri étaient moyens. Stationnement facile. Pas certain d'y retourner."}
{"text":"I went here once to wait for a ride in 110 degree weather for a about five minutes and would not let me sit in restaurant that was empty at midday. They wouldnt let me in cuz i have to buy something from inside. I didnt ear there but i never will when you have ugly people like that working there. Bad people"}
{"text":"You know I love sushi and have been to a lot of different sushi restaurants across the valley. Well, this is one of the best in town, certainly on the west side.  Great sushi at great prices.  Those high-end sushi place have VERY little on Sushi Plus.  If you go, tell Eunice Mark & Rose recommend the sushi.  Check out the kitchen menu as well."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and it was crazy fast!! Our waitress was very fun and nice!  Very good customer service and energy from the workers. Plus, all day happy hour Monday thru Thursday and Friday thru Sunday 3-6pm :)"}
{"text":"The lunch selection of items is just okay compared to other ayce sushi places I've been to. It wasn't worth the $22 I paid IMO. I won't be coming back. Also they close at 330pm and reopen again at 5pm which means if you arrive at 230pm like I did, you're told the kitchen stops at 250pm and you can't order anymore after that. I didn't see this anywhere on the website or on menu photos I researched online prior too arrival."}
{"text":"Checked this place out recently because  it's new in the neighborhood.  Decor is nice and modern.  Prices are reasonable for sushi.  Pretty typical offerings.  Food quality is ok, service was slow and they weren't very attentive.  Premium rolls are the same size as the cheaper ones that are half the cost.  There are better places within a few miles."}
{"text":"Decided to come meet a friend at Sushi Plus during my lunch break as she wanted sushi. They recently opened up but I wanted to wait a few months after opening before trying this place out because I only have 30 mins for lunch. I was kind of disappointed the precious Chinese place closed down that was at this location because it was literally my go-to lunch spot.   As for Sushi Plus my expectations for this place have surpassed me! I'm glad my friend decided to pick this spot for lunch because I was a little hesitant about it but now I think I will come here for lunch more often!   We both decided on a ramen bowl each. The one I chose was so full of flavor and everything I could have asked for. I tried my friends miso ramen broth and it was just as good. We also decided on two sushi rolls off of their happy hour menu ( 2 rolls for $9) we picked the spicy California roll and spicy chicken teriyaki roll. Both were fairly decent. I was more for their ramen.  However, they have a 50 states roll. A different sushi roll for each state. I guess it would be their 'specialty rolls' I didn't get to try any of those but next time I am curious to see what that's all about! I am a sushi lover and I want to love sushi here at Sushi Plus!  5 stars for excellent service my first time around, delicious ramen, and a good happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"By far some of the best quality sushi and food I had since moving here to AZ. I'm so ecstatic I live around the corner from this place, the tempura shrimp and California rolls were fresh and very filling. They even have a 51 state sushi selection, never seen that done  anywhere. Definitely an A+."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on this place and was really excited to try it.  I wasn't so much in the mood for sushi but, Japanese food.  I ordered the curry rice with beef and it was OK, not too bad but, not quite what I'm used to for Japanese curry.  My son ordered the shoyou ramen, while the broth was awesome, the noodles were NOT ramen.  They resembled more of a spaghetti than any Japanese noodle I've ever seen.  I am not comparing to a packaged ramen noodle, but other authentic noodles; they should have some sort of a wave/ curl to them and a distinct taste.  These noodles had neither.  I am going to give this place one more shot in hopes that maybe they had run out of their actual ramen noodles and maybe try another entree as well.  I have hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Good sushi for the price. Lunch includes sashimi too. I like putting in the order through the iPad. Service used to be too slow but it has improved IMO."}
{"text":"Great value and good concept. I love ordering off of the iPad Mini. Very clean and inviting. The soups, salads and apps are all incredible. The sushi: be careful not to order too much... It's very easy to be trigger happy, but the sushi is fresh and good. Amazing desserts. Try it out, you'll like it."}
{"text":"I found myself in Lasalle one weekday afternoon and I felt like a buffet. As I was driving on Newman, I came across a Chinese buffet in a strip mall so I decided to turn onto Dollard to go into the strip mall's parking lot and then I saw that there was also a Sushi Plus in this strip mall. Since I really like sushi but I was in the mood for a buffet, I wasn't sure if this Sushi Plus was an AYCE sushi place so walked over to the door and looked at the menu outside the door. The menu notice on the door indicated that there was an \"a la carte\" menu as well as an AYCE menu so I decided to eat here as opposed to going to the Chinese buffet place next door.  I was there at about 1:30pm on Thursday and the place was not crowded so I was seated immediately. After being seated, the waiter asked me if I was there for AYCE menu or the ALC menu. I mentioned that I was there for the AYCE. He then asked me if it was the first time that I was there and I mentioned that it was. He quickly explained to me how to use the tablet to order the items that I wanted. He also informed me that there were some items with a red circle and an \"i\" in it which were not part of the AYCE lunch menu but if I wanted these items, it wouldn't be an issue to order them but there would be extra charges which would show up when I submitted/sent the order to the kitchen. Most of these items were the more exotic seafood items like calamari and some types of fishes. The standard salmon sashimi  and tuna sashimi were part of the AYCE lunch menu. What I did find unusual was that the sushi with rice on the bottom and cut/open shrimp on the top had the \"i\" on it since that is available in most AYCE places as part of lunch.  This place has free WiFi but you must ask them for the password.  The hot & sour soup at this place was one of the best hot & sour soups that I've ever had. It was spicy and not too sour. I had some dumplings which were good. The salmon sashimi was very good. I didn't have any of the maki rolls. I also had some tempura eggplant, tempura shrimp, and tempura imitation crab. These were also very good. I also had some spicy seafood udon soup which I found to be very good as well.  Unlike in some other AYCE sushi restaurants, I didn't experience any issues with ordering items from their tablet (like tablet freezing up or giving error messages) and I didn't have to remind the waiter of any missing items that I ordered.  I found that the service was very fast but this might be due to the restaurant not being full at the time that I was there. There were only 5 tables used when I was there with a table outside on the patio being used as well. What I did find a bit weird is that you had to \"order\" refills of your water on the tablet. It didn't really bother me but this is something that I noticed as well as needing to \"order\" extra napkins on the tablet as well.  For dessert, they had 3 types of ice cream. The options on the tablet were single scoops or double scoop. Since I love ice cream, I picked the double-scoop option for each of the 3 flavours. The waiter came back to my table and asked me if I realized that I picked 6 scoops of ice cream in total and I confirmed with him that I did want 6 scoops of ice cream (2 scoops of each of the 3 flavours) and not 3 scoops of ice cream (1 scoop of each flavour). Along with the ice cream, I also had 1 fried banana. The fried banana was very good. In terms of the portion size, I would say that it was maybe a third of a banana which was cut in half. The fried banana had some chocolate syrup on it and tasted great mixing it with the ice cream (sort of a banana split).  Cost was $16.99 + tax + tip = $19.53 + tip."}
{"text":"Sushi is a hit or miss but the customer service could improve. I noticed the reviews are pretty good but maybe they are slacking which is why servers are slacking. Perhaps retraining needs to come in order."}
{"text":"Nice little spot to grab a quick lunch. Service was attentive and friendly. Sushi was good, props to the chef. Only thing is that prices are higher than most places."}
{"text":"Greetings Sushi lover, I am not use to write often,  but when i see a good place i want others to enjoy it too.This place opens at 11 am in saturday and sunday too. The red tuna is out of this word. The sashimi mels in your mouth. If you go there you muist try the eel, the spicy sammon and the dumpling nothing like you have teated anywhere. service is excellent fast, even when they busy.  There,  everyone with a big smile. If you are first time sushi eater, they will explain everything to you it is really that good pure japnaness sushi. Nothing less than perfect.Children are welcomed there.  Please let me know your opnion, when you get around trying them."}
{"text":"I am very glad I've found this place. I called in for a reservation for the same night. Service was prompt and good. I love how they explain which sushi is which when they bring it to you, because a lot of AYCE sushi doesn't care about that anymore. The place was spacious and clean. The selection of side order, sushi and sashimi was really nice. The tataki beef was one of the best I ever had. Sushi was made to order and fresh. Their green tea was delicious. Ice cream was also fresh and yummy. They also have a loyalty card which give you a stamp for every person at your table on the same card! AWESOME! I will be coming back for sure! Also, I believe that I saw somewhere on their website that you eat for free on your birthday! EXTRA AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Great food but the service is terrible. I've been coming to Sushi Plus for a few years now and the service used to be good. However, the service went down hill ever since they opened up other locations. I guess they transferred the good servers to the other restaurants. Now the servers are very slow and forget to bring out some of your orders. I've gone a few times to give them a chance to redeem themselves but the service is still horrible. Sushi is very good. I am also a fan of the cumin beef and the yakitori chicken."}
{"text":"I asked my son where he wanted to go for a snack after school because he got 100% on his spelling test.  He says let's go to Sushi Plus.  Please note we have never been here before.  So Sushi Plus it is.  WOW what a great find,  we each had one roll.  Me the AZ roll which was great and my son, The Nebraska roll which was also great.  While we were \"snacking\" my wife called and we told her where we were and she was filling a little left out.  So yes we returned for dinner.  That said we have decided to eat the roll for every state.  We have tried five, AZ,NB,MI, CA, and Pennsylvania,  can't wait to go try Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, next week.     A must try."}
{"text":"First time here and it was pretty good.  I LOVED the Maine Roll. No rice no seaweed in the mix at all. The other rolls were OK. Wouldn't come back for those whereas I am coming back tonight for the Maine roll.  Staff was friendly & welcoming & would recommend this place to anyone looking for FRESH SUSHI. Although i didn't like the taste of the rolls i had they were ALL FRESH !!"}
{"text":"I love sushi and I like this place, close from the UdeM, this is an all you can eat. You can order anything you want using an iPad and they have alot of choices."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service by Jade, was awful.  Jade is impatient and scolds you if you ask questions about the menu.  Too bad the owner won't let Jade go.  My other friends tried this place and won't go back because of her.   JADE, YOU SUCK"}
{"text":"Hubs and I stopped in for dinner and it was delicious!  Had an Arizona roll, and the happy hour 2 for $9.95 rolls (tempura salmon and spicy crab), along with an order of the spicy ramen with chicken.  Everything was great!  The service was friendly and fast.  So glad this place is right around the corner! Going to get through the 50 states in no time!!  Definitely a new favorite."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have found this place.  It is clean, the staff is quick and friendly, and the food is amazing.  The sushi is great, but you really need to try the different ramen bowls!"}
{"text":"Good sushi! Really enjoyed it and the service was nice and efficient! The interiors are a little too simple but atmosphere is just fine all the same. I like the creative way they have named sushi rolls after each state!"}
{"text":"Always amazing. always Perfect. I love the all day happy hours and spicy ramen. Service is always great and they make you feel right st home!"}
{"text":"Place just opened a few months ago. We've become regulars here over the past few months. We come almost every week during happy hour, which includes great prices. The restaurant is very clean and modern. They always have sports games on the TVs. The sushi rolls are always fresh. We also always get the gyoza, which are tasty. Eunice has been our sever the past few times and she is awesome!"}
{"text":"This will be our third time in three weeks, oh thats once a week since I found Sushi Plus on Yelp!  There are maybe three decent Sushi places this side of town and this is one of them.  The other two we have been to so many times we just needed something new to add to our usuals.  Sushi Plus more that fits that bill. I must preface this review to say that I do not enjoy going to the same place over and over, variety being the spice and everything but we still need to try some more stuff since everything we have sampled so far has been awesome.  I had the Ramen first time we visited, very good stuff. I must say I am not a ramen expert so in my novice opinion it hit the spot for me.  The hubs doesn't do soupy stuff much and he gave it a thumbs up! The rolls were well done and watching the family dynamics behind the sushi bar was very entertaining, most talkative sushi chefs I have run into, in a good way.  The staff is friendly and attentive. The space is clean and attractive, nice comfortable, informal yet still great for a date night or family gathering.  Well I gotta go get some now so see ya there :)"}
{"text":"New favorite sushi place! Loved the lady that took care of us and the sushi was top notch! They have an all day happy hour Monday thru Thursday and a mid day happy hour the other days! Great find thanks to Yelp again!  We will be returning (to try the plus)!"}
{"text":"Sushi is good, they have different rolls to choose from but there wasn't that much variety in fish. We also had a bowl of tempura udon which was also pretty decent. Do not get the ramen!! It's instant ramen and they just add extra items to it but charge you $13. It was probably instant Korean ramen. Definitely tasted like it. The ramen and udon took 10 minutes to come out after we finished our sushi."}
{"text":"This is no 4 1/2 star place, maybe 3 stars if the server we had wasn't so rude. Wow. With the obnoxious server, definitely 1 star. She was just unnecessarily over the top, in our face, rude. Did I mention she was rude? Ha ha. I can only assume she was wanting to head out, as it was later at night, after 9 PM when we went in. But this is no reason to be that way, and her job is her job, whether she wants to be there or not.  I wasn't too happy with the smell of the place; it wasn't sewage like I've seen in others' reviews; it was a very strong, overbearing odor of cleaning product that the whole place reeked of, as if they'd just scrubbed it and mopped its entirety in that smelly chemically product. In retrospect, I think they must have been preparing to close up when we got there. I dislike dining with a strong cleaning product odor as one doesn't get to enjoy the smell of the food. But, it was late, and we'd already checked: no other sushi place was open in the area and we wanted sushi.  Then there was the server. Wow, pretty much from the get go, she was obnoxious. . . znd obnoxious like I don't think I've ever had a server be that bad! My dining companion and I were just so uncomfortable. If we hadn't been so inclined towards sushi and if it hadn't been so late, we would have left and gone elsewhere.  First, she was yelling in Korean to the sushi chefs, and I mean yelling and standing right next to us, so it really wasn't enjoyable. Who does that? I think upon reflection, she may have wanted to drive us out?  Well, it got worse while we ordered.  I won't go into detail but I tried my hardest to slough it off and ignore it (as did my dining companion) because, as I mentioned, we really wanted sushi and this was our one choice in the area at that time.  Onto the sushi. Not really too much to say. It was just meh. Could have been what I ordered, but not really well rolled or beautiful, and it fell apart a lot when trying to dip it. Now it could be that the service tainted the food for me. Hard to say. I also may not have ordered the best rolls. The ambiance for me left a bit to be desired. Something about the place was uncomfortable in terms of seating and atmosphere. Too-large TV screens dominating in too many places for a smallish seating area and smallish place. I'm not a big fan of large TVs when I'm dining and wanting to enjoy my food and company and conversation. The prominence of the TVs takes away from that.  So, I'd give the food I had maybe 3 stars (again, I'd have to try the food one more time to tell if it was as good as others seem to think), the atmosphere 2 stars, and the service maybe a zero (negative star for rudeness? ha ha); so I'm rounding it out to 1 star. With regards to the waitress: there's no need to shame or belittle your customers for asking if the crab in the the crab tempura was imitation or real. It's just a question and not a stupid one either. But I guess she didn't like the question. Or she just likes to debase and belittle people. Or, it was late and she wanted to go home and maybe they were all ready to leave when we got there and they couldn't go. Whatever it was, it's too bad. It really made what would have been an OK experience unpleasant."}
{"text":"Sushi Plus is as good as it gets if you're like me: 1. I can summon a voracious appetite at any time. 2. I very much enjoy westernized sushi. 3. I am pretty frugal.  First of all, Sushi Plus is on top of their technology game.  They have a hyper-efficient system in place where all tables get an iPad and a unique identifying QR code.  You continuously order (in bulk) via the iPad menu (complete with pictures and ingredients), it gets made by the chefs, and finally, brought to you by the waiters.  It all feels so streamlined, I love it.  Every once in a while there might be a small hiccup in terms of how long something takes to get to you, but if you're smart with how you're ordering, it's no problemo.  I can eat somewhere between 40-50 pieces of sushi at once (yeah, it's insane and it's unhealthy).  After feasting, I get up to pay the bill: $15 for the all-you-can-eat lunch (for students).  Unbelievable. :')  I don't eat sushi frequently enough to have hardcore standards, so I enjoy the creative (westernized) maki rolls a lot.  If you come for dinner, there are a lot of super fancy ones not offered during lunch, but it'll cost you $25.  Nonetheless, there is *plenty* to choose from on the lunch menu.  But, tbh, I'll probably spend the $25 at least once to try the dinner-only rolls. ;)"}
{"text":"Great Sushi and great service!! This place hands down has the best Sushi I have tried in Arizona thus far . They have a unique menu with 50 states of rolls and they all have photos for them. I've tried 9 different state rolls so far and all have been amazing . I love the Indiana roll as well as the Arizona roll. Yummo!"}
{"text":"20 minutes d'attente entre chaque plat de sushi qui arrive, les plats de général tao sont TRÈS petits.   La première fois que j'y suis allé, j'ai vomis arrivé chez nous. J'y suis retourné pour un ami et j'ai presque pas mangé de sushi (juste du poulet) ce qui m'a fait évité de Vomir encore.  Au moins les Serveurs étaient souriants  En terme de qualité, sushi palace est 1000x mieux!! (Sans vouloir faire un placement de produit)"}
{"text":"Drove by this place a couple times and decided to give it a go for lunch today, and I'm SO glad we did! They had quite a few patrons, but we found seating right away. Servers were very friendly! Ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with pork and tofu, Spicy Ramen with chicken and egg, along with a Delaware and Nevada sushi roll. I'm not a huge fan of gingery broth and was so happy to find a place that doesn't dump mounds of ginger in their bowls - mine had none! Hubs really liked his ramen as well - he thoroughly enjoys spicy food and I knew he liked it when he started to sniffle a little bit! Everything was SO yummy! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I have ever been to. Customer service was great food was amazing will definitely be recommending to my friends and will be going back. Great food and Great prices happy hour Monday - Thursday!"}
{"text":"Rapid service, handy ordering system, great variety and really good quality for an all-you-can-it. We were pleasantly surprised! Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"We have followed the staff from their old location (K Sushi on olive) here because they are THAT amazing!!   Oh,  and of course the food is awesome toooo! This new location is really pretty inside. Perfect for a date night or night out with the kids."}
{"text":"Good sushi for a decent price! The staff was very friendly and the sushi chef talked to us while he was making our rolls. They also have a decent menu of alcoholic beverages!"}
{"text":"SUSHI PLUS IS DEFINITELY A PLUS  Trusty yelpers came through with a great recommendation. Started with the Kansas roll and I've never been to Kansas but I want to go now. The roll was really good, fresh and new! We followed up with spicy ramen and a bento box with sesame chicken. I loved the spicy ramen packed full of flavor and it was very hardy. The bento  was extremely fresh and delicious. Oh and the service was awesome. Our waitress was very nice and on top of things.   Things to know, they have a sushi roll representing of each state in the USA. Very cool, we can't wait to take our daughter for A geography lesson hahaha"}
{"text":"Dropped by on a Sunday afternoon for a quick sushi fix. The service was fast and great! Our server was super sweet. We're celebrated my little bro's belated birthday and she even brought out some cheesecake with a candle for him! That was so thoughtful :)   Now for the sushi, they had a wide selection of different rolls and plenty of options off of the happy hour menu! (By the way, any place that has happy hour everyday is awesome in my book). It was yummy and fresh. I saw that they had ramen too so we'll definitely be back to try that! Overall a great choice!"}
{"text":"Good and affordable sushi buffet; for $14.99 on lunch time you have a wide selection of items to choose from, and vetegetarian options as well. The food tastes fresh and is salty but good. Service was fairly quick on a weekday at lunch time. A buffet I will go back to, certainly."}
{"text":"Ehhhh...it's not my favorite but I don't hate it either. The shoyu ramen is flavorless and my friend didn't like the bimbimbop. The sushi wasn't bad. I don't know about the fish my cucumber roll was good but then again it's a cucumber roll so you can't mess that up. Waitress was nice. Prices are good. They have happy hour from open to close Monday thru Friday. The one thing that really bothers me about this place is the smell. It literally smells like sewage in there. It's overwhelming and can suppress your appetite."}
{"text":"Delicious Sushi and Ramen, especially love the miso soup. Will return."}
{"text":"Second time here and love it. The food is amazing plus delicious and the service is awesome. If you haven't been here give it a try."}
{"text":"Went here while in the valley...food was good. My Mom got the fried rice...too mushy and used too much sesame oil. Worst part was the staff ignored 2 drunk hipster skater \"dudes\" who were extremely obnoxious and openly on speaker phone called their \"Bro\" to talk about how \"Google famous\" they were going to be posting pictures from the place! Ruined any part of the visit. Staff was friendly but needs to know when EVERY OTHER PATRON WAS ANNOYED BY TWO DOUCHE BAGS ! might return."}
{"text":"Excellent for sushi and comfort food.  Great happy hour all day M-Thr and 3-6pm Friday thru Sun.  Try the tonkatsu (pork) ramen. Fabulous. Kentucky roll is another favorite.  Sake bombers a great price.  Waitstaff very friendly and accommodating. Always leave here full and happy."}
{"text":"I rarely crave sushi but today was the day I actually craved it and I was glad I did. Sushi plus had opened a few months ago and I was pretty surprised that it had rave reviews, I was expecting like 5 reviews.   Stopped in today for lunch and ordered the spicy California roll and spicy chicken teriyaki roll off the happy hour menu. Which I was surprised they had happy hour because on the outside of the building and on Yelp it said happy hour was from 3-6pm.  However I guess happy hour is all day with the exception of Friday's 3-6  I also ordered the miso soup with pork and the broth was nice and hot and full of flavor.   I'm glad I walked into today for lunch and found an amazing little gen that had replaced my old Chinese restaurant before sushi plus!   My only complaint was that the sushi rolls were falling apart before I could pick it up.  Great customer service and speedy if your on lunch break!"}
{"text":"Best service and sushi I've had in awhile. So glad i found this lil gem on the west side. I recommend the bibimbap and sashimi.... but lowkey everything is good quality and flavor here, even their decor is nice and clean."}
{"text":"Wow! The disappointment!  Just went to sushi plus about 2 weeks ago and was very disappointed.  I saw so many great reviews on Yelp and was excited with the possibility of finding a new sushi spot in town.     I walked in, saw nobody there and thought to myself, \"this is going to be great! Fast service and great food!\"  Boy was I wrong about the food.  Service was phenomenal!  Our waitress was definitely fast and kind.  Now to the food, we started off with the appetizers, edamame and Shrimp tempura.  Edamame tasted very old and not fresh and the Shrimp tempura was decent.  I was very excited with the concept of having sushi from every state.  I ordered the Connecticut and Louisiana.  The CT, was decent again, but the Louisiana I am going to have to give it a thumbs down.  Once again, the fried salmon on top just tasted old to me.  My wife, not a big fan of sushi, was excited that the menu had Ramen.  She ordered the Miso Ramen with pork.  This was almost the best dish we ordered.  The broth and noodles all blended so well with great flavors in this beautifully mastered bowl, but then we got to the pork... DRY and just didn't taste FRESH.  Unfortunately the good did not out the weigh the bad for me.  Maybe they were off their game that day.  Unfortunately though, I do not have the courage to come back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I had the tonkatsu Ramen and it was so delicious. The service is friendly and the food is wonderful. You really can't go wrong with anything you try here."}
{"text":"Excellent!! We found a gem in the west valley. Spicy seafood ramen and miso ramen were delicious I"}
{"text":"Thought we'd try a new sushi spot, and this place got 4.5 stars.  Well, not from me!   Rice was cold and mushy, tempura was cold, and several items were forgotten until we asked for a third time.   And the waitress, while very friendly, ended our meal by scraping and stacking dishes right at the table.  DISGUSTING!! Guess we'll have to keep looking for a really good sushi restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This updated 5 star review isn't accurate because the most stars I'm allowed to give is 5.  This was truly 6 stars.  Came back recently with my friend and my oldest child.  We had the pleasure of having Eunice serve us and she went above and beyond not only for us but for all of her tables - no joke.  She was so fun around my kiddo and treated him really well.  She was very engaging with him and my friend and I as well so that is always appreciated and that does not go unnoticed by me.  We ordered all of our food from the happy hour menu.  2x veggie tempuras, edamame, 2 rolls for 9.95 (California and calamari).  A single order of veggie tempura would be large enough to split between two people and we regret ordering 2.  Not because it wasn't delicious but it was so much food!  Both rolls were very good but I found the calamari roll to be slightly too salty.  I would order it again though.  If you are on a budget but want some quality food, definitely stop by during happy hour.  You and your wallet will leave full."}
{"text":"Came here to check out a new sushi place. Just moved to the area and really haven't found one I liked until now.  Great sushi great prices and service was so sweet. I will be back for sure and will bring my friends and family."}
{"text":"We've literally been coming here since the day it opened, and for years at their previous location. The food, atmosphere and service are all fantastic. We've brought friends here & multiple people now drive from across the valley to come here. Couldn't be happier to support a small business run by genuinely good people!"}
{"text":"The food was good, service was good. Only complaint was that the rolls that are named after states are so extremely large that you can't even put them in your mouth at once. Other than the rolls being massive, they tasted pretty good- just a bummer that they were so big."}
{"text":"I just moved here to AZ and I found out this amazing restaurant. I like their Pizzas  and the food is very delicious . I go there like 3 times a week. The place is super clean and very comfortable to sit and enjoy dinner they also have outstanding pasta dishes this is the best pizza in the valley."}
{"text":"This all you can eat sushi restaurant is definetly a hidden gem. It's a good place for just 2 people or large groups. The sushi is fresh and they have a much better selection in comparison to others restaurants. The service is quick, but not too quick so it's enjoyable. They also have food as part of their all you can eat menu which is good if youbhave friends who aren't sushi fans. Must-trys: kamikaze, honey sushi, sweet potato tempura and sesame balls."}
{"text":"I have not written a review in a long time since I retired from the yelp world, and due to my current CRAPPY experience at Sushi Plus....it's TIME I started again.  I woke up yesterday morning with a strong craving for Ramen and some positive memories.  Lucky for me...my sister and our friends were also craving for Ramen so we decided to get Japanese for dinner.  Unfortunately the place we intended to go was closed.  So we got on yelp and search for another place and found this place, DUKEY.... I mean, Sushi Plus.   The moment we open the door to this place we were welcomed with a strong stench of sewage with a hint of POOP.  But it's okay, my appetite is hard to break.   The waitress that was serving us was \"rude\"! She looked rude, smelled rude and overall acted rude.  She clearly didn't wanted to be there that night, which I totally understand, it smelled like A bowel movement in there, I be pissed too had I been stuck working there all day.  Anyways, we all order our Bowl of Ramen or Udons, minus one friend that also ordered an additional roll on the side, she got shamed and was offended when the waitress stated that the bowls were big and if she was really that hungry.  She was not very nice either to me when I didn't know I had a choice of what I wanted with my Ramen.  I sincerely thought I was getting what's on the picture which was delicious looking.  But I'm okay, it's very hard to offend me.   After we ordered, I was so disgusted and drained that I had to excuse myself to use the Loo to do a TWO....gotta let out all that SH*T I just experienced.   And right when I was about finished pulling my pants down to sit on the throne my sister text me saying to get the eff out of the bathroom and that we were leaving because the waitresses was talking smack and called us all b*tches... I was like thinking to myself... \"really?? really!?!... is this for reals!!.....Can't a man take a DUMP in peace without any drama\".  So I pulled up my pants, washed my hands and we paid for our drinks and left for a different place.  Which was a better experience with good food and friendly staff.  It's a shame really, I wanted to have a positive experience and to enjoy that Spicy Ramen.  I'm sure it would of tasted great, but now I would never know.  I don't see myself ever coming back to this place.... I just wanted to poop in peace but nope they had to go calling me the B word."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday night, happy hour all day!! Place is very clean and was very cool! Ordered 4 rolls and Calamari. The Calamari was ok. Honestly I'm gonna stop ordering the Calamari its just not a forte for anyone here in Phx. The rolls were delicious! Service is amazing as well! Love family owned businesses. The owners of this place were the owners of K Sushi on Dunlap. Will definitely be coming back, thank you Sushi Plus for offering quality at affordable prices!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing, the best rolls were the spicy crab roll and the spicy chicken teriyaki roll. The New Jersey roll was great as well if you like an explosion of lemon and cream cheese in your mouth! The host was really sweet and made sure that you were taken care of. I will definitely come back to try more of the amazing and fresh sushi!"}
{"text":"When we first walked in we were so turned off by the rancid smell. We really were thinking on dashing for the door, but we gave the place benefit of the doubt because the night was already getting late.  Jade was our waitress, and it was fine as she took our orders, then all hell broke loose. Not 1, but 2 instances caused us all to pay for our drinks, pick up and go.  Jade was taking our orders and I was the start. I wanted some Miso Udon, and also wanted to order a roll as an appetizer to share. As soon as I said I wanted the extra roll, she asked me \"are you hungry?\" topped off with some sarcasm. Thanks for the shaming Jade, real classy. I decided to tell her I didn't want the roll and she proceeded in defense to say that the bowls of Udon were big when she heard my offended tone. I said no again and again  after she continued to ask me if I was sure and that I was able to togo the roll if I don't finish. Why even say anything the first place to change my mind when in the end she's trying to persuade me to get the dang roll?  My friend Simon wanted ramen and ordered his dish, and she asked him what kind he wanted. He didn't know that he could pick his protein and simply asked \"what kinds are there?\" Instead of responding she kept on pointing at the menu and making him look for the small print, he was looking for it and she finally figured out if would be faster just to explain to him...   Unfortunately, we didn't even get to try the food, we felt so unwelcome, offended, and uncomfortable we had to cancel our orders and walk out. $8 dollars and change, for 2 waters, 2 teas and a sprite, that's quite high.   I really don't find myself coming back to try the food unfortunately. I enjoy places that participate in making the client experience a good one.  Originally I gave Sushi Plus a 1 star. I decided to up my review to 2 stars because a waitress, Eunice, reached out and apologized. I felt that some effort and customer service was in place, so I decided on giving them another star."}
{"text":"Being a local of Lasalle, I'm so happy there's finally a AYCE sushi restaurant near me! Everytime I come here, the staff is always polite and courteous, and the food is always fresh and warm. I love the ambiance inside and their variety of menu items, and ordering from a tablet makes your dinning experience so much more easier, pleasant and enhancing.  This place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for sushi but didn't want to drive too far. Found Sushi Plus on Yelp and gave it a shot. I was not disappointed! So delicious and the staff was very friendly and attentive. We will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Don't let the sparse furnishings fool you, this place is great. Came here in the first few days they were open to try it out. I got the spicy ramen with beef and it was excellent. I was a little worried it would be over the top spicy, but it was just the perfect amount, and it was a huge portion. My boyfriend got sushi (spicy California, spicy chicken teriyaki, Arizona), and said it was some of the best sushi he's ever had. (I don't like sushi so I can't judge). Definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I love Jade, I was so sad when she disappeared from K- sushi and we didn't know where they all went. It was the best surprise ever to walked into sushi plus and see her smiling face. Service is best as usual, I love sushi that I can taste the difference from one another. Happy hours is always a plus, I will recommend it to everyone, and definitely will go back as often as I can.  And they do uber delivery."}
{"text":"Étant une grosse amatrice de sushi, cette place me semblait l'endroit idéal pour du sushi à volonté. Beuacoup de choix. service rapide et atmosphère agréable...Par contre, nous avons arrêté d'y aller après avoir découvert que le saumon dans le maki avait des os. Et cela nous a simplement dit une chose: Saumon en canne!  Nous n'y allons plus jamais, mais les autres choix de sushis sont très bon."}
{"text":"good tempura and reasonably priced good quality sushi! Try the shrimp and calamari tempura and during happy hour only 5 dollars. hh is 4-6 I think and they're currently getting alcohol license."}
{"text":"Jade is HILARIOUS. My family always has a great time, and the food is great, too. Great, friendly staff, and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've had sushi all around the globe, and this was some of the best. Very nice employees too! I'll definitely be back often. :)"}
{"text":"I decided this place was going to be my last dinner in Montreal before going back to Buffalo, NY. I found this place again on my trust Yelp app. By looking at the other reviews, i decided to take a chance. This place is not near downtown so you have to drive to get there, and to me it was worth it.  They have pretty decent AYCE sushi. most definitely not a 3 star place, but not a 5 star either. The only thing that would have made it 5 star if the red tuna (ahi) wasn't sliced paper thin, If it wasn't, this place would get a five star.   This place is a great find for the AYCE (all you can eat) sushi lovers out there. The restaurant has a great selection for dinner when i went and the price is pretty decent as well. The sushi was all really good and they don't try and fill you up with a whole bunch of rice. The wait staff was always prompt and nice to me. The place was spacious and clean.   I would recommend this place to anyone that enjoys a good AYCE sushi meal from time to time. I will most definitely be back to this place when I'm in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Sushi is delicious and they have a fantastic happy hour!!! I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Gigantic portions, tempura to die for, and awesome beef yakisoba. They didn't have their liquor license when we went today, but I look forward to the time when it is approved."}
{"text":"This place could be good, but needs work. I ordered 1 roll, spicy salmon roll. Was made traditional but had just the salmon in the middle with sricha dabbed on outside, for a very American style sushi place this feels to me lazily made. (Salmon tasted fine)  their happy hour was $$. 2 rolls for $9.95. Ug where are the basic $3.50 California or spicy tuna.  I also ordered 1 salmon tuna nigiri, was ok not good quality. And I ordered tankostu ramen. The ramen and veggies were tasty and meat but the broth was boring. It had no flavor.  This place could be good. I hope in the future."}
{"text":"Good food but Worst service ever  This is my 3rd time ... Things havent change  Im done with this place"}
{"text":"My family and I LOVE this place! The staff are super friendly and the service is so quick!  The food is DELICIOUS! Definitely have a Maine roll. I'm fairly certain that it's the reason this place will be around for a LONG time!"}
{"text":"This place is filled with amazing staff who make you feel at home and so comfortable as soon as you walk in. They were joking with my dad calling him adorable names and playfully bantering back and forth.  I plan on coming here again. We ordered the beef and green onion, California crunch roll, and gyoza. Our sushi artist made them so presentable and gorgeously delivered.  EXTREMELY SATISFIED!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my mom today. She had a Bento Box with chicken teriyaki and I had lunch sushi sampler. I was able to upgrade the California roll to spicy tuna roll for a couple of bucks. I was impressed with the value in the amount of food. But they aren't just slinging junk fish here. The food quality was great. I especially liked the tempura calamari and the seared albacore nigiri that had a vinegar and green onion mix on top.   I think I found my new good to sushi place. I want to try their 50 states of rolls and some bibimbap."}
{"text":"Service était affreux, les serveurs sont lents et oublient souvent les commandes.   La quantité était là, mais pas la qualité. Riz était sec et certains sushis avaient trop de riz.   Les plats sont amenés (stratégie de certains all you can eat) par des petites portions.   J'étais dans plusieurs buffets de sushis, c'est un des pires, je ne retournerai pas ici."}
{"text":"If one person has a bad experience, they will tell on average thirteen of their friends. I would rather tell the Yelpverse!  Firstly, it smelled like sewage. After some hushed exchanges between me and four others on whether or not to bounce, we decided to stay. We weren't trying to make a scene as there were other people already eating. But yes, against better judgement, we stayed. So drinks were ordered, a long amount of time passed, and then our waitress came back. She was an older lady who didn't have the best customer service and made my brother and my friend uncomfortable when ordering. I think her name was Jade.  Jade first gave my brother some grief for not being prepared on what protein he wanted with his ramen. He had thought it came one style and didn't see the fine print towards the top of the menu. He's blind as a bat though and asked what his options were and she just kept pointing at the menu before finally caving in and telling him. This is my brother she's treating this way, guys. I wasn't happy.   And then when it came time for Tran D. to order, she gave her attitude for wanting to order udon AND a sushi roll. What?! Who said she wasn't gonna share with the table? Don't shame her for wanting to order two things. Tran was offended and decided to not order the roll.    We ended up canceling our order and leaving after paying for our drinks due the the terrible service and attitude of the staff. We don't know how the food is all due to Jade's unprofessional and distasteful attitude. We were nothing but polite considering we all work in the customer service industry. Yelpers, be warned.  * Review edited and increased by one star due to Eunice reaching out by message."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious.  Huge portions. We had to take some of everything home with us.  The service was great also.  Staff was friendly and made great conversation.  We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Un bon restaurant sushi all you can eat sur Montreal. Pour les remarques négatives : le riz ne colle pas forcément sur tous les sushis et makis proposés ce qui est parfois déplaisant lors de la dégustation et le personnel ne parle pas un mot de français. Pour les côtés positifs j'ajouterai le concept de commande par tablette qui rend le service très rapide et une carte relativement fournie."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a little over a year now. I'm sad to say that I have to bring my rating down.   The owner is incredibly nice! He's very smiley and attentive. However, the waiters are a little distracted and it's hard to grab their attention. They spend more time talking amongst themselves.   The service has also slowed down. It took longer than usual to get our orders even though the restaurant was rather empty.   The quality of the food has also gone down sadly. The sashimi isn't has fresh and the tofu that I loved stopped being crunchy and juicy and it's just rather soggy now.   They still use the iPad to order. However, the interface changed. Now it doesn't look like an app, but more like a webpage that isn't made for a mobile/iPad   The prices are still the same. Total of 20$ for lunch and 30$ for supper (after tax and tip). Lunch might be more worth it in my opinion.   I hope this place turns around. I really did love it before!"}
{"text":"Went to the soft open on 2 February 2017 and had the tonkotsu ramen. For a place that isn't advertised as a ramen place it was good. The broth was a little on the lighter side but the 4 included pieces of pork and the huge portions really made up for it. Definitely recommend a visit and will be coming back to try the teriyaki chicken.   TLDR: Portions are huge."}
{"text":"This place is a great find for the AYCE (all you can eat) sushi lovers out there. The restaurant has a great selection for both lunch and dinner and the price is pretty decent as well. The sushi was all really good and they don't try and fill you up with a whole bunch of rice. I would recommend this place to anyone that enjoys a good AYCE sushi meal from time to time"}
{"text":"Vast menu with over 50 sushi rolls, also noodle, rice and ramen dishes. Awesome happy hour specials. Very friendly service. My roll (Maine) was delicious, very fresh."}
{"text":"Mes papilles criaient sushis après le travail l'autre jour et je suis ravie d'avoir découvert ce restaurant sushis all you can eat qui offrait un take-out!  J'ai appelé 20 minutes à l'avance, fait ma commande et tout était prêt à être payé à mon arrivée! Ils ont quand même une bonne sélection de sushis et offrent des combos intéressants incluant soupe et salade.  Le prix est extrêmement abordables pour la taille des sushis! Souvent, on retrouvait énormement de tempura dans les rouleaux mais je dois également préciser qu'ils ne lésinaient pas sur le poisson et leurs sushis n'avait pas trop de riz.  Pas le meilleur des sushis mais Sushi Plus saurait satisfaire rapidement un craving :)"}
{"text":"First time my family and I went was the best experience ever and will surely always go back for more food. They value their costumer and are just very caring staff. I LOVE THEM MILLION STARS IF I COULD."}
{"text":"The salmon was not fresh, the dim sum was crazy sad looking, and they have a tendency to use too much oil when cooking. Not impressive quality at all. Will not go back there again."}
{"text":"They should rename the place Montreal Fried Sushi!  We went there yesterday and this was one of my top 10 worse restaurant experiences ever! And misleading on price, too! The website says that the price for dinner from Monday to Thursday is $21.99 but we were charged $23.99. The waitress told us that the price changed 2 years ago. 2 years ago and you can't  change your web site?  See the page in question: http://www.sushiplus.ca/Images/2.pdf * I have news for them: a website is easy to update.  Even in the printed material inside the restaurant, the to-go menu, it is $21.99 -- the only thing we could find is a paste over outside that mentions the new price. But of course, when you already looked at the website, you just walk in...  Also: - LOTS of fried stuff, greasy greasy greasy! The only sushi we relatively liked was the Kamikaze, but don't expect red tuna (one of the most expensive sushi fish), they put salmon instead. Two other rolls we had were fried and greasy, and saucy, almost junk food...  - Low quality choices. The only red tuna I could find was on a sashimi and of course, the rice ball was big but the fish was so the thinnest I ever saw, lol. And no matter the roll descriptions you read, it pretty much always boils down to crab-roll, tempura shrimps and salmon with some variations of the rest.  - Another disappointment is that we only inquired about what appetizers the waitress liked, inquired, yes! And she started choosing for us a bunch of greasy appetizers. Since we have to eat everything (or be charged), I protested that she was ordering too much of that stuff, but she argued that it wasn't much, so we sort of agreed, therefore we ended up with fried veggies, very-fried chicken (and there was a lot), fried tofu, fried and oily dumplings, etc. We had no choice but to eat all that junk or we would have had to pay for it. :( I am unsure if it is a misunderstanding (maybe she is used to choosing stuff for some consumers) or if it was part of a strategy to stuff us with less expensive things. Tofu is less expensive than fish, isn't it?  - Also, on a side note, there was no soap in the men's room, which I always interpret as a sign of carelessness -- and how do the chefs clean their hands before returning to work if there is no soap in the restroom?  In the end, with the surprise $23.99 price per person (instead of the advertised $21.99), the sake plus tax and tip and despite our $5 rebate (The to-go menu has a $5 coupon off per table), we still paid more than $70 for a party of two, for a disappointing experience. It's sad when you think that, for $5 to $10 more, we could have had a great sushi moment at one of the normal (not AYCE) places we usually go to.  The only positive note is that the staff was rather friendly, but all the rest was a  disappointment.  Before that, I had always resisted trying all-you-can-eat sushi because I suspected that they can't make quality in an AYCE sushi concept, but we decided to try it because of others saying they liked it. It turned out the place was visited mostly by young males looking to stuff themselves... that's the whole point here, that is what this is all about: STUFFING. Don't go there if you want a good sushi experience. If I could put half a star, I would...  The ever-lasting rule is still true: There is no such thing as a free lunch. If they give you a lot, they have to cut somewhere, there is no magic..."}
{"text":"The staff here is honestly one of the kindest I've ever encountered. They are sweet and personable. Their customer service deserves beyond 5 stars, however their food was honestly one of the worst things I've ever had. Their Alaska roll was atrocious. The salmon smelled rotten and tasted even worse. I took the salmon off but even the California roll was terrible. I hope it was just me who got a bad batch."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant 10 stars I would. My experience was a 10/10. The atmosphere is amazing, the workers are friendly, and the food cannot be described! I'm amazed at the variety on the menu and it's reasonably priced! If you're a true sushi fanatic like me, you'll love Sushi Plus without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Based on all the 5 star reviews we had to try this new place.    The hostess was very sweet and our gyoza were delish and did come out super fast.  Hubby LOVED the sauce that came with them.  When he asked for more to try it with his sushi she went straight away and brought him more.   The sushi and rolls were tasty and the portions were good.   Our only issue was that we overheard one sushi chef say to the a younger guy behind the counter that he should not have left an item where he did as it was not at the correct temperature.  Kinda scary.  The same young guy was talking about Mother's day and cursed loudly enough for us to hear. Just didn't seem very professional to be talking like that with customers nearby. Hopefully it was an isolated incident as I would like to go back and keep trying the delicious food."}

{"text":"This place rocks!  The presentation is beautiful, the staff is fun and knowledgeable, and the food is spectacular!  What more could you ask for?  If you're hungry, go!!!     I recommend the Kansas roll, kinda sweet and cravable.  Hubby had the Pennsylvania roll, it was HUGE and almost 2 rolls in one.   The Florida roll is also delicious and beautiful. This is our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends when we went down to visit Montreal. The food was decent but it wasn't amazing. I'd come back here if I was craving sushi late at night - the hours here are good and the establishment closes late at 11pm - I'd probably not choose to come here if I was really craving some great sushi. I've definitely had better in other establishments.   The sashimi was decently cut and it wasn't cut too thin. I found that some of the surf clam wasn't the cleanest when I was eating it. Some of the kitchen items weren't the greatest - we ordered asparagus and beef rolls and it was literally the smallest thing.. about an inch in size each.. Let down for sure. The green tea ice cream also didn't taste like green tea at all.. but more like vanilla. Their other dessert items were decent.   The service was overall good - no complaints. I'm not a fan of the operating system on their iPads for ordering - it's not very organized and user friendly in my opinion.  Overall good."}
