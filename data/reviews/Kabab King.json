{"text":"I've been to this place countless times as it's one of my favorite restaurants. I love Afghan cuisine and this place does it perfectly.  The service is excellent, they come by you several times to make sure everything's okay. I love their food. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Some of the best Gyros and Mediterranean food we have had.  Sunday brunch buffet was deliciously heallthy.  Friendly staff and open environment.  Kids had fun sitting in the room with the cushions on the floor."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see the local Gyro place. First thing is the name - Gyro King raises the bar very high, which is in my opinion doesn't represent the reality. This place is   Unfortunately fairly rated for 2-3 star max. The wait time was around 20 min, with only 2 people in the restaurant. The food was ok, combo plate I think is overpriced for the amount of meet they offer and gyro was not with fresh meat, but tasted alright. Overall I would give 3 starts, most likely won't come again unless in so hungry or very lazy to go anywhere else, since it's very close to my house."}
{"text":"wow! this is the best kabab kabob i've had in all of phoenix! and the owner is SOOOOOO nice. it seems like he doesn't do it for the money at all - rather to provide the community a service and a gathering place. such amazing food, all fresh, in a clean environment, with such pleasant service. only downside is how far it is from central phoenix - but i'll still be going back!!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place! Nice ambiance considering it is a strip mall restaurant,  excellent Middle Eastern food, large portions, reasonable prices, and attentive/friendly/helpful/professional service.  I'm a bit of a falafel conneiseur, and theirs was one of the best I've ever had.  I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I grabbed lunch here to go. I had ordered the gyro and hummus. The gyro was delicious and even the presentation was nice! The hummus was good but I would have liked a different type instead of the original. The owner said he was working on changing up the menu, so I will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The owner is very friendly and since there weren't a lot of other customers in the restaurant when we were there (Thursday night) we had a little chat with him. I had the Gyro and my wife had the Tandori Chicken. We also got the three piece Samosa and a plate of five falafel balls. My favorite was the falafel balls, which were just wonderful. I've never eaten falafel that tasted so fresh (and I've eaten falafel straight off the street carts of Jerusalem). The Samosa's were also great, very tasty little triangles of pastry with chicken meat inside. 

My wife's tandori chicken tasted like it had been cooked right over a campfire. It was like you could close your eyes and pretend you were in the mountains of Afghanistan eating it. She at every single piece, and that is something she usually doesn't do. 

I think the weakest part of the meal was my Gyro. It wasn't bad, but it was fairly bland. Not much sauce and not a ton of taste. But it was only $6 and came with french fries so you can't complain too much. 

They have a meat dish that I will try when I go back. They also have a buffet on Sunday afternoons for $14 that is all you can eat of every different thing they make. 

This is a simple restaurant. They don't have a large menu at all, I think about ten items. This means it very easy to decide what you want and the food comes really quickly. 

I would recommend this place even if I didn't like it simply with the hope that we will get more novelty restaurants on this side of town (I love Mexican food, but it's nice to have a choice for something else, you know). If you, like me, have seen the sign for \"Kebab King\" as you drive down Baseline then I suggest you give it a try one of these days. It's worth the very modest prices. Total cost for my wife and I (including 15% tip) was $28 and we got two entrees and two appetizers. I think he might want to consider raising his prices a bit, I wouldn't want to see him go out of business because he didn't charge enough. 

Thanks for the great meal!"}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and quite authentic. It's my first time stopping by here but I plan on ordering take-out from them since they're so close by and very cheap. The portion sizes are very satisfactory. I believe I dealt with the owner and he was very polite and professional. We ordered takeout and the food was still piping hot. They've earned my business and I hope they'll earn yours too."}
{"text":"Started off with Hummus with Pita bread and Sambosa both delicious and authentic tasting. No pics only because we devoured it before I thought about taking any. Unfortunately, the rest of our meal didn't live up to the great start. Our meal came out almost cold and the Kabab Koobideh had a smoky but tangy flavor (not sure if that's how it was supposed to taste) that was not pleasant. Although, the chicken kabab and chicken tandoori were good, despite the food temperature."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there on a weeknight. Only two other groups dining.
They had a midweek special on Kababs.  I ordered the lamb kababs with the salad and stuffed grape leaves. The lamb was cooked perfect.  Everything was so good.  My wife ordered the mixed kababs and loved all three of them.  We cannot wait to go back. The service was very good. The best thing was the check was about what we spent at the sit down burger joint."}
{"text":"the food was delicious, family owned, all the food is bought fresh in the morning and prepared.  We had hummis, gyro, greek salad, eggplant, and sambosa.  our new favorite restaurant in our area of town."}
{"text":"The kabab combo was awesome. The meats were moist and seasoned beautifully. Dolma is yummy! We also ordered Greek salad which had a very generous amount of feta, everything was fresh. Our order came with lots of pita bread that was fresh, chewy and soft. A perfect healthy dinner as we were settling into our new home in the neighborhood. We will be back! Oh I almost forgot, it's not on the to go menu but my husband asked if there was any soup available.  The helpful man working was very happy to accommodate us with the BEST lentil soup I've ever experienced. It was thick and creamy and delicious! Everything was packed well for the to go order and stayed hot too."}
{"text":"We. Went there for yelp review. The restaurant was empty and no one was there except owner. Owner told us. they don't have chef today but they make food just like chef. We waited 30mins and couple of guys came in to just use restroom - one came out and standing in front of the restaurant and the other two didn't show up. When they came into the restaurant, they look around and look suspicious.Call me paranoid- I was really scared. After couple mins, food came- we just did take out. Food was terrible- no taste and cold expensive- the most of all I didn't feel safe in the restaurant- I will never go back"}
{"text":"Having been here a few times, and unlike Chris A.'s expectations, who went to this Afghan restaurant in order to bitch and moan that it wasn't \"authentic Mediterranean food\" (ya think, big boy? Do you also patronize Mexican restaurants and then complain that it's not authentic Chinese food?) in what appeared to have been a meth-induced, rambling review, I was expecting Afghan food. I received good Afghan food. 3 stars for the higher prices than comparable restaurants."}
{"text":"I was impressed by their chicken - in both varieties. Much better then all of the chain fried chicken places around. They advertise the bread, hummus and pastries as home made-the hummus and bead were very tasty / they were sold out of the pastries so I couldn't try those yet. Can't wait to try the Gyros. Love the little room where you can sit on pillows on the floor and hear there is an extensive buffet menu on Sunday's that I hope to try soon. A much needed food option addition to this area-Check it out!

This has become one of our favorite restaurants-with a visit at least once a week!  The food is consistent in quality/taste-always fresh, with new options added periodically. They still have buffets-now extended throughout the week and now deliver as well. 

Great owners - great food - small local business - can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the kabob combo! The chicken is delicious and the meat. The rice has always been so delicious and not oily as I expected. Gotta try it! I've recommended this place to all of my family. I'm lucky I live right around the corner"}
{"text":"Excellent place! Just tried this place out for the first time today and it won't be the last. Service was great and the owner was so nice! The hummus is amazing and the falafel pita was delicious. Crispy and fresh. I'm still thinking about it. The pita was huge as well and only $6 I think. The only thing that could have made the hummus better was if the pita bread was warmed beforehand but the hummus was so delicious I didn't mind. I also tried the Turkish coffee for the first time and it was great as well. I rate this place 5 stars for taste, price and friendliness. Please check it out and support our local restaurants!"}
{"text":"I was so happy a few days ago to see this is open again and then tonight more pleased to see my friend and owner Basir Ali.  The food was awesome, I had the number 6 plate. Maybe I was just missing the food so much but the marinade and seasoning on all three of the Kababs still leaves my mouth watering  and waiting to go back tomorrow for the Sunday buffet that starts at 11:30."}
{"text":"Not authentic tandoori on the tandoori pita. Flavor was way off. Gyro a little greasy but good."}
{"text":"First time today with friends - loved everything! So fresh and flavorful. Got the 3-Kabab plate with a delicious salad and hummus. The spring roll appetizers were really yummy too. Will return soon"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious and abundant. Our waiter was quick to answer any questions. We have enjoyed lunch and dinner on several occasions."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here, they recently renovated to become a restaurant, as they were a grocery store with a small cafe before. Absolutely loved the food, and the staff was very kind and friendly."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood meeting my client at the final will thru.  Yelped and found this place.  Food was delicious.  Thank you.  

I have the Chicken Tandoori combo.  Yum."}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews, but when I do, it's because I am blown away! (Really, I am busy with children and life and chaos too be bothered sitting down writing a 3 or 2 star review.) 
The first time I ordered was the first week and they were out of Mujadara, as they were, I imagine working through the kinks of being slam packed as a new business in this suburban, somewhat country town. I had falafel and hummus that night.
Tonight, I ordered Mujadara, Fried Eggplant, and Hummus with pita bread.  Everything was ready for me to pick up (I haven't dined in yet) in 15 minutes.  The Mujadara was beautiful and flavorful, while seeming to simple: rice, lentils, yogurt and some spices. The Fried Eggplant had a tasty grilled flavor and sauce that was amazing! I can't recommend trying this dish if you haven't. My family was nuts about the hummus as well. We all eat food of international origin practically daily and hummus constantly, so we do have discerning taste.
I was only disappointed to not see more people dining in here on this Monday evening around dinnertime. I hope more people will give them a try!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Mint Hill and super excited to find an authentic Lebanese restaurant in town! Food is fresh and delicious!! I grew up in a Lebanese family and definitely recommend to try."}
{"text":"I had the Tandoori plate. Can hardly go wrong with chicken. It was very tasty. I wished it had a little bit of hummus and a little more bread. I spoke with the manager and he said he was still working on the arrangement of the plates to minimize waste. He said he would put a little bread and I think also some hummus at no extra charge. I'm going to take him up on that the next time.

The price was reasonable. Definitely cheaper and more affordable than other places I've eaten in the valley. The usual places I eat range from $15-$20 a person. They are between $12-15 with a can drink.

Definitely will visit them again a 3rd time."}
{"text":"So my husband and I decided to try something new and let me tell you that this place doesn't disappoint! The decor is very original the customer service was exceptional! The food was incredible and delicious. We had the Gyro Sandwich and the Kabab Combo. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful dining experience! There is a beautiful sitting room with pillows and low tables that was exciting to sit in. The food was great-- it reminded me of street food. Very flavorful and well seasoned. The service was fantastic-- I believe we were served by the owner, who was very sweet and personable. My only wish is that the food had more sauce-- but that may be a personal preference. Overall, we will be back!"}
{"text":"There's a really long comment somewhere on here. I mistakenly typed my review in the comment section, not sure how. But .... you're read the really good things in the comment section, here I'll give you the cons. 

The food is served fresh and pippin hot. However, it does not travel well nor does it reheat well. I'd go so far to say if you're unable go sit down and eat it there then don't order it. We had about a 30 minute drive to get home. I couldn't wait. I ate the side Greek salad in the car and 2 falafels. I didn't have much green lettuce in my bowl, mainly white, they probably could have throw this part of the lettuce away. It wasn't spoiled or anything just the very, very end of the head of lettuce. I took one big bite of the tandoori chicken wrap for good measures before we got home. It was good ...  it great, lite on the flavor, heavy in the grill taste. 
By the time we got home the wrap was ruined, the bread was sooooo soggy. I ended up eating it with a fork like an open faced sandwich. I noticed sliced pickles on the wrap. I'm a fan of pickles, huge fan even, just wasn't expecting them on the wrap. They made it so dern soggy! I'd definitely try Kabab King again by next time I'm sticking with an original gyro and I'm eating in there."}
{"text":"Absolutely best Middle Eastern cuisine in the area! Very reasonably priced, generous portions, and fresh & delicious food- don't forget to save room for the baklava!"}
{"text":"The best gyro I ever had and I have tried them all! The meat always taste Fresh and oh so delicious.  The owner is also friendly and knowledgeable. The only thing left I want to try is the Sunday buffet."}
{"text":"We've lived in this area for almost 4 years now.  When this place first opened as a grocery store under a different name and different ownership, we were pretty jazzed.  We were told every time we went in and grabbed fun items like pickles or spices, that they would be serving cooked food soon.  After a few years of it never happening, and it changing hands several times, we kind of gave up on coming.  Once I saw the Kabab King sign up, I was really excited.  It took what feels like forever to finally open, and then even more time before we finally had the opportunity to go here.

We had an appointment at the nearby Sonora Quest Lab and decided it would be a perfect time to try it out.  We both ordered the Gyro with French Fries.  This does not come with a drink, you have to pay extra so we both got bottled waters.  We also ordered the sambosas.  It took a while for the food to come out.  First, the sambosas came out with a nice green sauce.  Very good, but you can tell they were store bought and cooked in a toaster oven.

We waited even longer and finally got our Gyros.  We were so very disappointed.  The meat is imitation frozen meat.  The kind of stuff I've only seen once or twice in my life, where the strips are all uniform, as if they were vacuum formed.  Anyone who's ever had anything close to an authentic Gyro would be able to spot this.  It's the same fake stuff I mention in one of my other one star reviews, a deli and grill using this junk.  My biggest issue was the Gyro poster on the wall depicting REAL Gyro meat cooked on a spit.  There was very little meat and a lot of lettuce, tomato and pickles.  The sauce was so thin, it felt a lot like store bought Greek salad dressing, not tzatsiki.  The fries were cold, bland and soggy.

We went to pay and he charged me for the food that the ONLY OTHER CUSTOMERS in the entire restaurant ordered.  We had to correct him, as it was about twice the cost.  They thanked us and reminded us of the buffet on Sundays. Don't think we'll be back or try the buffet here.  Much like trying a taco at a Mexican food place for the first time, if you can't get a Gyro right, then there's just no love in the food.

The restaurant was hot, with big fans blowing and one TV set to some weird channel about $35,000 plane tickets.  I can't even imagine how hot it will be this summer.  None of this surprised me, but I REALLY wanted to be surprised.  They all seem like really sweet employees and owners and very friendly, and it makes me sad to give only 2 stars.  It doesn't seem like they do enough business to support making all fresh stuff which is fine, so maybe they should re-envision their business and represent itself as a fast food mid-eastern place."}
{"text":"Great new place here in Mint Hill! Healthy and tasty Mediterranean food. Staff could not have been any nicer or attentive. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ive been to this place twice. The food is the best in Laveen. It is different and unique from everything in Laveen. I definetly recommend everyone to try it out. It is also really affordable under $10 and they have a sunday buffet. The place looks amazing and the owner is the nicest guy in the world. Always support your local businesses and restaurants over the corporate skums."}
{"text":"My sister received a flyer for this place at work and we decided to give it a try. We were not completely convinced at first, but happy we gave it a try! I ordered the combo plate and my sister ordered the chicken kabob plate. The beef was so tender and waaaaayyy tastier than other places (Persian room) the amount of food was ample and enough to share if need be. My sister loved her chicken plate. The chicken was just as flavorful. The owner was very nice and was happy to explain the menu and chat with us. We will def be giving them another try and adding them to our list of go to restaurants! Give it a try if your up to something new."}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly service! Food is very fresh and inexpensive. Little off the beaten path, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and tasty food. First time trying this spot and we will be going back. We had the Gyro rice plate as well as individual Gyro's and they were spot on. Bakhlava was great too! Looking forward to trying their all you can eat Sunday buffet."}
{"text":"Always enjoy my food fresh friendly service will come back over and over again.close to my home they do delivery"}
{"text":"Food is wonderful and a nice change from other restaurants in the area.  The owner is so nice and goes out of his way to make sure you are happy with your food.  I have been here several times although I have not experienced their Sunday Buffet, although I plan to in the near future.  Give them a try, and lets remember to support our local businesses."}
{"text":"Small place hidden in the corner of Baseline and 27th Avenue great food got to come and check them out they do are having a brunch special from 11 to 3 got to check that out when you get a chance and they do a carry out also so you got to make sure that you jump on this and get in there and try"}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times and every dish has exceeded my expectations [the baba ganoush]. The plates have a generous amount of food and are packed with flavor. The glass of red wine [Malbec] was surprisingly good, our group ended up buying and splitting the bottle rather than buying by the glass. This restaurant is on my short list of go-to places. 
If you haven't been here, it is worth trying."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food. Price is not cheap, but not too expensive either for the food quality/quantity. The various combos are very flavorful and the meats are well seasoned. I always get their chicken sambosas along with a combo, as the sambosas are among the best I've ever had. They are a must try, especially if you've never had sambosas before. Glad to have a delicious option in Laveen that's not fast food. It's a small family run business that makes delicious food in Laveen, and they definitely deserve our support."}
{"text":"This is my to go place in Mint Hill food is great and tasty, clean however our first visit was we waited so long, I guess they just open up the place and they didn't have server yet anyhow I would recommend for everyone to try this place!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. I try to give this place another chance but they are still a disappointment. I ordered the kabab combo. The meat was dry and not that tasty. They gave me the smallest piece of pita bread. It was pathetic and undercooked. I don't know if it was pita bread. Salad was small and gross. Rice was okay but everything else was horrible. Please put some pride in your food or get out the business. If your looking for good middle eastern/ Asian food keep on looking"}
{"text":"Food is pefectly cooked and great every single time i come here! I had to tell the owner this 20x, its amazing! Love the rice and kabob combo perfectly done!"}
{"text":"Kabab King is now one of our favorite restaurants. Sammy is terrific, a welcoming and knowledgable host. The food is stellar authentic Lebanese and we are fortunate to have this spot in Mint Hill. Try any of the salads, apps or kebabs and you will have a super meal."}
{"text":"The lamb with rice is delectable. The lamb shank is well seasoned and tender to the point where even the ligament has turned into a savory, almost gelatinous treat. It was served over a pilaf-style rice preparation, with a side of green salad, a whole grilled tomato, and a quarter portion of soft pita with tzatziki. The restaurant is very clean, service is friendly, and prices are moderate. This is a great place to treat yourself to Mediterranean cuisine if you are in the area of Laveen Village."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Customer service was great. Food was delicious. Hummus was delicious, chicken kabobs were moist not dry like other places. I'm glad we finally have a Mediterranean restaurant in Mint Hill that is actually good. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Kebab King continues to impress, with delicious authentic Afghan fare.  If you're not familiar,  I highly recommend that you become so. Generous plates of tandoori chicken,  lamb, beef koobideh, and more are featured in a friendly,  homey atmosphere.  The owners are a lovely family and everything is home made.  Five stars."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Been wanting to try this place for awhile and was pretty impressed. The gyros were yummy and a little different than I'm used to. Only gripe would be the hummus was really runny."}
{"text":"Ordered gyro sandwich and falafel side thru Yelp app.  Place is super clean and looks very neat, staff is very nice and friendly.  Food was delish, loved the gyro meat and the falafels were crunchy... next time more sauce please! lol other than that 5"}
{"text":"This is an absolute hidden gem. I was very pleased with my meal, I ordered the Chicken Shawarma and it was a delicious. The plate was full and very flavorful. They have a variety of sides to choose from. They also serve beer and wine. I will definitely be here again to eat! If you enjoy Lebanese food, you won't be disappointed. A side note is that the location is not a place for large groups, but great for groups of 2-4."}
{"text":"One of only a few local places to eat something other than fast down here. Especially considering my wife is a vegetarian. We both had the Falafel Salads with a side of Baba Ghanoush which came with Naan and the Baklava for dessert. A little pricey considering I am used to Veg dinners usually costing less than meant dishes, but that's OK. As usual, the food was very good. The Falafel was not overly fried. Light & Crispy, just right. Fresh and tasty salad and we both enjoy the Baba Ghanoush. And to top it off, the Baklava is delicious. The only Cons are: They are a bit slow, but that's to be expected at a small family run place. If it's to go, CALL AHEAD. Like I said earlier, a little pricey. But definitely worth it for homemade food and to support local businesses. Not a big fan of the naan, maybe I'm just used to the Indian version? And the Baklava portion  is TINY, especially for the price. All of these things are more nitpicky than anything. Definitely worth the trip and will be back : )"}
{"text":"I'm not going to get into too much detail. I ordered a gyro and some empanada looking things. It was soo good. The downer, the kid behind the counter couldn't present a lunch special. So I bought Al a Carte. $12 later I'm satisfied. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I've been to several Greek restaurants in my time (large and small and family owned) in different states and I'm very disappointed  in the meal I ordered.  It was a simple Gyro Greek salad meal.  But I received store bought oily sliced Gyro meat, bagged iceberg lettuce, black olives not Greek olives and runny Tzatziki sauce with no flavor.  Usually one would get pita bread with their salad but the charge $.50 for a 1/2 sliced chewy pita bread .  I guess I expected to much.  

You'll find a Chicago style Greek location in Avondale that is a small family owned business and it's great.  I'll stick with them.  

I hope Kabab gets the message and does better."}
{"text":"The food is great, well priced and comes out fast!  I'll be a regular customer for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down my new favorite place to eat. Second time here and a week and I am not ashamed!! Food is amazing and the owner is super friendly which makes the dining experience that much better. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I really hope the Kabab King makes it. It's in a tough location but it has the advantage of being in an area that doesn't offer anything great.
It's very cozy inside, would be good for a date night. Sadly I was alone but the good food kept me company. The interior is very nice. You can tell that they spent some money on redecorating the place.
I was pleased to see that they offered beer as some middle eastern places (I'm talking about you Kabab-Je) do not. Unfortunately the selection was very limited with no draft offerings.
I'm pretty sure the hummus was the best I've ever had. Another downside however was the fact that the bread was packaged and not fresh. I ordered the mixed kabab with a yogurt sauce and grape leaf wraps for my sides. As expected, the lamb kabab was the best followed by the kafta and then the chicken. 
Thank God for that delicious tahini (another best) or the chicken would have been too dry to eat. My sides were okay but I would definitely try some other ones next time. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Delicious! We went for the Sunday Buffet, open 12-4, and ended up waiting until 12:30 for them to open the buffet. But once we were able to dig in it was really yummy! The chicken was perfectly seasoned, everything was fresh and tasty! I tried Dolmas for the first time and was pleasantly surprised with how delicious they are! The Hummus was AMAZING!!!! It was such a nice buffet option for a lazy Sunday afternoon. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Food is so good! we just came from convention and had dinner in this restaurant. Owner is on top of everything and food is so so good!!!! 10 stars...."}
{"text":"Great tasting appetizers and wonderful service. The hummus and samosas were good, I would have liked for the the pita bread to be a bit warmer but other than it was tasty. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"While the food is good, they take orders on grub hub they cannot fill and then don't refund the difference in the food you received."}
{"text":"Really good food and a delightful hostess/ bartender/ cashier! 
I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place, great food :)))), lots of food for the money can't beat it when you want to eat a lot for a decent price"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  My wife and I visited it for the first time today and the food was delicious.  We are vegans, and this place had a lot of vegan options on their menu, which was a pleasant surprise.  The moussaka and lentil soup were a great combination, and the atmosphere was very relaxing.  My wife had the Falafel, which I normally don't care for because they tend to be very dry, but this one was very good.  We're looking forward to coming back and trying more dishes!  By the way, if you have tried Kebab-Je in Matthews, this place has a Lebanese flavor profile that is much different.  We like both places and now have a choice based on our mood :)"}
{"text":"Wow! I dined there for the first time tonight. El and I were a bit concerned at how crowed it might be since it was Black Friday, but we were seated immediately. Our server was very polite and attentive. The food was excellent and served extremely quickly. El loves their Whipped Garlic Sauce, Addie loved the rice, the fried cauliflower was amazing!, and the kabobs were excellent! (beef, chicken and lamb). We will definitely be. Back!"}
{"text":"Best food in my neighborhood!!! We come several times a month. The place is always clean and the owner is friendly."}
{"text":"Not many places near here to get this type of food so, very fortunate that it's delicious and the people are friendly. Gyros and falafel are great. Can't wait to try the buffet."}
{"text":"This place is okay. The portions are big, the food is good, and the service is great. The pita bread isn't my favorite and the atmosphere is strange, though. Not normally many people there. We prefer Kebab Je and Zoe's Kitchen when the mood strikes, but like this place well enough."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite middle eastern spot so far in Charlotte. As a foodie, and someone that has grown up eating middle eastern food, this place ROCKS!! The food is well prepared (dine in or take out), perfectly cooked, and Sami is super friendly. We can't get enough of this place. Try the desserts as well, all home made. I'm just glad they're not too far out"}
{"text":"Me and the lady stopped in here for to go lunch today. We both got the beef gyros with a side of basmati rice.

This is hands-down one of the best gyros I have had. Everything was on point from flavor, texture and freshness. the taziki sauce was fantastically vibrant with flavor.
The pita bread with the softest I have ever had.

The rice was cooked perfect not oily at all and was seasoned very well. 

We will be absolutely be returning to explore the other options on the menu.
Also btw a few days of the week they offer a buffet for a great price. The owner mentioned it is a good opportunity to explore most of the menu for sorts timers"}
{"text":"Not Afghan at all.  In fact didn't know what this restaurant was.  We went there and we ended ordering a greek-ish and indian-ish dishes.  We didn't even see any afghan dishes on the menu.  I know that because I am an Afghan.  If your in search of a Afghan restaurant search other places."}
{"text":"I needed a place to grab lunch and ordered takeout from eat24.  I avoid big burger chains like the plague and wanted something different from the area.  I was pleasantly surprised by this charming little place off Baseline in South Phoenix.  The order was for falafel with rice, gyro wrap and dolmas.  Everything was delicious, not dry as I've experience with other falafel and I recommend giving this place a try.  The order was packaged with care and the young man at the front desk was pleasant.  The restaurant looks like a small family run operation and hope to order again in the future."}
{"text":"Wow. This food is amazing. I got the kebab combo and the meat is so tender and delicious. Rice is awesome too. Very nice place, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've passed this place a lot of times on my way home from work. Today I decided to come for lunch. And boy am I glad I did. Once I placed my order the owner was talking to me and telling me how everything is made fresh daily. He went back into the kitchen and brought me a fresh made soup to try. It was to die for, it was so very fresh.   I can't wait to eat the chicken wrap I ordered.   If you're in the area do yourself a favor and stop in. I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"Unlike Paul R.'s unnecessary comments and ignorance (maybe he really went to the Mediterranean areas and Afghanistan), I do not review a restaurant based on a rude attitude towards those who didn't appreciate his new favorite place.
Overpriced food, slow service (this one is fine IF the food is good!), flavorless food: I won't be back. I don't really understand the good reviews, obviously people have never tasted authentic Mediterranean or Afghan foods to compare..."}
{"text":"Food is authentic and really good. The buffet is awesome!!! If you have never had middle eastern food, i recommend the buffet! A little bit of everything to try.  Prices are reasonable too... Will be coming back, A LOT!to this establishment!!!"}
{"text":"The food here was dislish, it was first time here and I've tried many and I'm glad they are close by home. Now I have a place to go when I'm craving something middle eastern."}
{"text":"This place won't last...been a couple times and each time I've ordered the same thing and the total has been different and part of the order had been messed up or forgotten. Make sure you check your food before leaving. Whoever opens doesn't open on time. Horrible service"}
{"text":"Super amazing food!!! I came here with my company for dinner and everyone here was so courteous. I loved the hummus and all types of kabobs. Everything was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"An amazing local restaurant. The food was delicious and the service outstanding. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing! Even my husband thinks so and that is saying something. He is Greek and usually doesn't like Lebanese food. The workers and owner were so very nice and gracious. It wasn't busy when we went in, but by the time we left the place was packed!

We started with an order of the cauliflower. It was good, but I will say Kebab-Je's is better--that was the only thing that wasn't better than Kebab-Je however.

We both got the Chicken Swharma plates. Me with Tabouleh and Yogurt Dip and my husband with Rice and Stuffed Grape Leaves. Mine was amazing and a TON of food. They also had an awesome sauce that was super spicy with it. Loved it. 

The place has great prices and the food is authentic. We will definitely be going back here!"}
{"text":"4 adults and 3 children dined in on a Thursday night - food was great and so was service - loved the owner - he was so nice and accommodating - will def be returning here"}
{"text":"We haven't been in to the dining room yet but ordered delivery from them.  The food was excellent: chicken, steak, and lamb was well flavored, tender and grilled perfectly.  Rice was also well seasoned and cooked well.  Side salad was obviously a bag mix, but the dressing on it was delicious."}
{"text":"Such great food and such great service! The rice is amazing and the meat is unbelievably tender and perfect. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable new Middle Eastern restaurant in Laveen, Arizona. Nothing too fancy but a much needed addition to the community.  I've only been there once but had the Kebab Sampler, Chicken Wrap, Hummus, and Baba Ganouch.

Kebab meats were all tasty. Chicken was a little dry, but the beef was tender and flavorful. Can't wait to try it in a gyro next time. The shining star is the chicken tandoori.

Hummus was tasty too, with liberal amounts of olive oil and paprika. Baba ganouch was ok but not spectacular.

I can't wait to try the other dishes. I'll add a photo of their menu to this. As far as the service, it is slow so plan a little time. I've heard they are a scratch kitchen so everything is fresh. They are kind and explain the menus and ingredients if you ask. It also looks like they will be doing buffets in the future which I'm looking forward to!

They are a little rough around the edges as they are a new business. AC wasn't working, they still needed a soda machine, they ran out of some dishes. But the food is good for the price point. For two people with two dishes and a side of baba ganouch, we came out spending 24 bucks including tip.

Will go again!"}
{"text":"Omg this food was absolutely delicious. The customer service was excellent, very attentive to the customer needs. I order the lamb kabobs with a side of rice and a salad. The meat was very tend and cooked to perfection the salad was the best salad I ever had in my life. If you are someone who enjoys incredible food you must try this place."}
{"text":"My wife loves this middle eastern restaurant!!! The chicken kabab is amazing !!!  Very good restaurant!!"}
{"text":"When you walk in the place is still under construction. You order at the entrance by this kid (who is actually really cute and smart). The food took really long to come out. We waited almost an hour. Then when it came out there was no cutlery to eat the food... They served the food in a to go box, even though we were dining in... Umm...The koobideh was pretty good, rice could do a bit more saffron. Needs a lot of work with the service. But hopefully in the future it will improve. It's no Persian Room that's for sure."}
{"text":"I came here from out of town with someone who comes frequently and I have to say that this place is the best food around. The owner is probably the nicest guy I have ever met and a very humble and nice owner"}
{"text":"Happy to be the First to review!

To start this place used to be an ethnic grocery store, so when you walk in, it still sorta looks like a grocery store.  

Came in for dinner with my husband.  Ordered the combo platter and falafel.  The combo platter came with rice, side salad, tandoori chicken, kabob chicken, and traditional kabob meat.  Everything tasted fresh and homemade.  I really liked the kabob chicken but my husband really liked the tandoori.  Neither of use cared for the traditional, but meal loaf/balls/kabob has never really been my favorite so go judge for yourself.  I also really enjoyed the rice. The falafel was also very good, but I didn't enjoy the sauce as much. The meal came with humus, garnished with chickpeas and a very yummy olive, and pita which was also tasty.  We were even offered a refill of the humus!

The place is clean but still transitioning from a grocery store.  Unfortunately it was very hot as if there was no AC.  This is a big issue that I hope is resolved.  Service was fantastic! The owner seems to be waiter, cashier, and cook at the moment and he seemed to be doing everything better than I would expect!  

Wanted to order baklava but they were sold out.  The owner says they make it daily and it sells out fast!  

I hope this place succeeds.  I love local businesses and Laveen needs more food options.  I would love to see them expand their menu a little and add salads or maybe see their demand grow and not have items sold out."}
{"text":"This place looks closed and vacant. Look for the flashing open sign, it's easy to miss.  Stop by you won't be disappointed. I think I dealt with the owner, he was Very friendly. My gyro was fresh and authentic.  They have an Afghan style buffet on Sunday's, Good selection."}
{"text":"We're new to the neighborhood and still exploring. 

Went to Kabab King on Friday night and the food was awesome. 

Enjoyed sitting outside on a beautiful October evening. Yosef, our server, was just the nicest young man was also very attentive to us. 

Not much of a view but the food made up for it. Fresh and full of flavor, thy Gyros had savory tastes in each meaty bite. 

We can't wait to go back and try ALL they have to offer. 

Got dessert to go and finished it before we got home! Honey drizzled delights. Must have them again!"}
{"text":"The Highlight is Buffet, with tax it's $15.11. the buffet is pretty lame with 9 items. They give you 1 plate and you had to use it for the whole Buffet. No one there and food taste ok. I wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place several weeks ago and I forgot to review at the time. We went in early on a week night and the place was empty. We were the only customers and had the owner /chef waiting on us. He was very good at explaining and recommending dishes and brought us a few different appetizers to try. They were very good and actually filled me up so the meal was not as appetizing as it should have been because I was full. The taste was good and I remember the hummus being good as well. The owner really gave us the TLC, explaining each dish and checking in often. Unlike the place in Mathews we didn't receive pita bread so I'm not sure if they have it or not but it would have been nice to have. All in all we were satisfied with our meal and would return."}
{"text":"I had the Vegi platter and my friend had a customized dish. The food was amazing and the service was excellent! Great little place in Laveen! We'll be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and owner was very friendly! Definitely will be coming back. Had a great first time experience."}
{"text":"$13.00 for this? Seriously? First and last time coming here. Wow. 5 TINY pieces of meat, half a tomato, some lettuce, and 3/4 of a container of rice."}
{"text":"Wonderful is an understatement! The service as well as the food was incredible. This was our 1st time there and the staff told exactly what every was on the menu and made great suggestions to compliment our entrees. Gonna have to make it back here soon."}
{"text":"I am giving 3 stars because they try. We ordered take out so this review is solely based on takeout experience.  

Gyro Sandwich w/ff
The gyro meat was mediocre.  The meat looked like it was deep fried and not even close to the picture. It came with lettuce tomato and pickles. I was Really disappointed with the fries.  They were a bit undercooked and soggy. And there were probably 12 small pieces.  

Chicken Kabob Sandwich w/ff
Great Flavor!  Pieces of sliced marinated chicken thigh. The chicken was very dry though.   It came with lettuce tomato and green pepper. I was Again, really disappointed with the fries. 


Chicken Tenders w/ff
The tenders were terribly soggy. And very very oily.  (Probably because the oil they cooked in was not hot enough) They came with a little bit of lettuce and tomatoes.  Very small portion of fries.  About half of a McDonalds small.  

Samosa 3pc
These were absolutely Delish!!!!  They are small but filled with a tasty chicken mix. Came with a little side of sauce that complimented the little fried triangles. 

Earlier in the afternoon I stopped by.  The buffet looked great!  Unfortunately I could not stay. So I had to return a few hours later for the takeout.  

The owner was very nice though and was eager and excited to service.  Which is why I decided on 3 stars. 

My wife and I will try one more time.  Next time we will dine in to see if the experience changes compared to takeout.  

They have great potential. We need more variety in Laveen as it grows.  I hope they can address some of the kinks that come with a new restaurant to drive more business and repeat customers."}
{"text":"So great to have a Lebanese restaurant in Mint Hill. The food was fresh and very delicious. Service was great.   Prices are reasonable with good quantity of food for the money. This will be our go-to Kabab restaurant over the other two in Matthews.   Best fried cauliflower!"}
{"text":"After a lengthy wait, the Kabab King has finally opened, next door to Dunwellz. Some time ago, this was a Mexican restaurant (not Taxco - that's down the ways a bit).

The first hurdle they will have to overcome is the location - being back in the corner is not a great location. Hole in the wall is one thing. Restaurant in the corner is another entirely, but you never know.

The second thing they will have to deal with is that this place is small. While Dunwellz and Taxco are relatively large in the number of people that can be seated, there are only a handful of tables in this restaurant. That's a shame, because they were all full when we went. To make matters worse, kababs (shwarma, etc) are not always the fastest food to serve and eat.

When we arrived, the staff was friendly and happy to have us - the problem that we ran into is that there were a lot of them. Thought there were lots of people trying to dine? There may have even been more people working there. Seems like every time we looked up there was another person asking how we were doing. Now that's great and all, but at the same time, they could probably do with a bit more organization - one person could turn in a circle and just about handle all of the tables here, and it might help to get the food out a bit faster too.

As to that food? It's reasonable. If you don't feel like driving to Kabab-Je or Pita Kabab, or all the way to Jasmine, then it's not bad, especially since they just opened. It will be interesting to see how they develop, or if they can overcome some limitations of the space."}
{"text":"I have always been pleased witht he food I have ordered at Kabab King.  Great for unexpected company or if you just don't feel like cooking.  The food is fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"This place was amazing, some of the best food I've had in the valley surprisingly. The owner was very friendly as well. I tried the sampler plate so I could get a little bit of everything and it was excellent!"}
{"text":"Great tasty option in an area that doesn't have so many options. Tandoori chicken salad was awesome. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty  AMZING. All fresh! It's a must!!  Never knew!! Thanks to yelp!!!  Best food around here!! Super nice an friendly. My new best friends!!"}
{"text":"Great local business operated by a genuinely nice individual and neighbor! Food is fantastic, and we tend to make ourselves regulars for it. Decor is great, and it's a peaceful atmosphere. Sunday buffets are a must, and a great way to experience the range of their food.

I would definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter and I picked up a to-go order from Kabab King tonight for the first time.  We had Falafel Salad, Chicken Shawarma, Moussaka with Hummus, Pita Bread, Basmati Rice and Grape leaves.  Everything was wonderful and delicious.  We will definitely make this a regular place to go, and really happy."}
{"text":"I was hesitant when this popped up in a strip mall next to my nail salon, but I decided to try it one day and actually quite good! I was very quiet when I've been, but it may have been the time of day or because it was relatively new. Food was prepared fresh I could tell, it took a tiny bit longer but it was no hastle.   They also deliver - I live two blocks away so I don't do that, but if you needed food ready for a quick pick up on the way home they have something for everybody. Standard salads, kabobs and gyros or something a little more original with some spice and zest. Awesome yellow rice by the way!!  Interior decor could be better but the people and food is great so that's what matters most"}
{"text":"A kid up front took our order. We received the kids chicken strips and the pita and we were still waiting for our combos. The kid came out and explained they were out of beef, though it was disappointing, not a huge deal, we will just go with the chicken. He comes back a little later and then explains that they no longer have any rice either. At that point we cancelled our order. My heart went out to the little dude, having to tell customers that the restaurant is out of one thing after another is hard to do. We got our money back for the two combos and waited while the kids ate the chicken strips. Not once did an adult come up front to see if he needed help with anything or to apologize to us. He was on the phone constantly explaining to someone that he really needed change and kept asking when they would be there. I am all about family owned places and love when the kids get involved, but someone needs to take responsibility other than a ten year old."}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant. We have only had takeout orders so far.  The food is ready in 15 and oh so good.  The salads are fresh and the meats cooked perfectly.  Hope to see them around in MH for a long time."}
{"text":"Finally!  A Middle Eastern spot has made its way into the growing town of Mint Hill, NC...and it's delicious!  We tried the hummus, bread, beef kabobs, chicken with the special kabob marinade, tabouli, fattoush salad, and spicy potatoes.  All of the food was excellent.  We are glad kabob king is open and will most definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Definitely the most healthiest food in Laveen!  The Greek salad is delicious!  They just added the wings and salad to the menu.  Big on flavor low on price and it comes with salad!  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Pita with Garlic Sauce it was awesome and the portion was above average. Service was good. Fries where hot and tasty. Price was under $10 for dinner!"}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal!!  Everything I've tried so far (chicken sandwich, chicken tandoori, chicken tenders, Bolani, hummus, buffet items, etc) has been absolutely delicious!  It's flavorful, fresh, and I can't wait to eat everything on the menu.  And the owner is very nice... It's so good to have this restaurant here!!

In addition to the foods above, the restaurant just added a burger to their menu.  The burger is so tasty as well!  The quality of their food is truly wonderful... I'd eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner if I could!"}
{"text":"Had the tandoori wrap, was ok, the chicken is served refrigerator cold on the inside of the wrap which was unexpected, but I've never had a tandoori wrap before so could be the norm, I probably won't order one again if that's the case"}
{"text":"First time and I ordered for pickup. I ended up running some errands and had to nuke the gyro, some triangle pocket things,and baklava. Both were amazing and it's finally great to have a real gyro, lamb damnit, not beef. I highly recommend this place, priced great and amAzing food. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu items available."}
{"text":"Love the Kabob combo platter and their veggie Samosa's are great! Make sure you get the chutney that goes along with it and I'd ask for an additional Tzatziki sauce ...  great service, great authentic ambience and more importantly great food!"}
{"text":"Much needed cultural addition to the area!  We had the buffet late on a Sunday afternoon and everything was delicious. I particularly enjoyed the afghani eggplant and the chicken kabob."}
{"text":"I came here after reading reviews. It did not disappoint I ordered the chicken Kabab plate. It had so much flavor, the rice was perfect and a good side salad to go with it. Portions are a good size too."}
{"text":"I enjoyed lunch! We had a chicken tandoori sandwich and a gyro. We wanted French fries but the gentleman informed us he ran out. He offered a substitute and let us try sambosa(a bread pouch w/meat and veggies). It was a good alternative and I liked it. It's a very small quaint restaurant and you can tell they utilize the space for family gatherings. Overall, I'll be back to explore the menu some more."}
{"text":"A much needed adition to the area, owner is super friendly and makes you feel right at home, food is very good."}
{"text":"I ordered the Kabab Combo, Falafel with humus and baklava. It was all very good! I especially enjoyed that Kabab combo and baklava  I will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"First time trying Kabab king, i was pleased with their service as a new costumer. I happened to go there for a quick bite on a Friday evening, hardly any customers at all. I waited at the front reception for a short while until i had to ring their bell to get some assistance. The cashier that attended me was really nice and being that it was my first time eating at their place she described what their dishes came with pretty well. Their pricing on their menu is reasonable possibly the most expensive item i must've seen had to be no more than $25. The restaurant could use better decor, especially their bathroom. They only got one and its all the way towards the back near their exit door. One of the things i really liked was that you can place your order ahead of time with just a phone call, saving you time for the wait. As far as the food goes it all seems freshly made on the spot, taking them just a little extra time to bring it over to your table. I'm not sure if the cashier was also the cook, and waitress, for the day but from what i saw she delivered our food and seemed to be going back and forth towards the back while at the same time attending incoming costumers. My recommendation would be to hire more help for this restaurant if its needed."}
{"text":"I went here today and the decor is nice and the staff is friendly (although not much for waiters he mostly kept to the back of restaurant.) and me and my friend were the only patrons so it would've been possible to check up on customers. and they have a lot of specials and deals but the food was not up to par with my expectations. 

It looked nice and was plated well but the flavoring was dull and bland. Even the tzaziki sauce was water with no tang to it. And the gyro meat almost seemed packaged there wasn't any real texture or flavor to it. But it wasn't all bad. The rice was pretty good.

Overall it is a nice place with potential but the seasoning needs to be bolder and ingredients didn't seem too fresh. So I would just they focus on the food aspect and this will be a great restaurant. 

From looking at the other reviews I feel like most of these 5star ones have been going to a completely different restaurant.idk if you just wanted the free drink so you wrote a nice review or what but this place is far from 5 stars"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Really enjoy the food and the service is perfect. I also really appreciate that they stay open a little later than other restaurants. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Best Lebanese food I've ever had. So much better than the place in Matthews. Atmosphere is modern and cool. Food is magnificent, service is great except it takes a little longer to get your entree, but it takes longer to cook shwarma and similar meals. But I enjoyed relaxing and talking with my wife instead of rushing for your food and hurrying out like most restaurants in America are.  It's a must if you live in Mint Hill!"}
