{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love this place. We lived in Japan for many years and it's very rare to find a restaurant with authentic Japanese taste in the US. Hire Sushi definitely has it though.  Tip: try sitting at the sushi bar (walk in only) and listen to the chefs banter in Japanese. Even if you don't understand it it will be fun."}
{"text":"I think this is the best sushi in the valley, I can't think of any other place that is as close to the traditional Japanese experience, without flying to tokyo, except I haven't been to shinbay yet in scottsdale.  Wife and I go here a few times a month and almost never lets us down.  Great eel, spanish mackrel, tempura, and toro.  Great service too, sometime almost too good!"}
{"text":"I'm genuinely surprised by all the good reviews. I got the Sushi Dinner and was not impressed. The fish was old and tough. It should have been smooth and creamy - almost buttery - when you get the good fresh stuff. I've actually had better supermarket sushi, and Sakura Sushi in Kingman, AZ is better by far, which is pretty sad. I should have known that a restaurant named after a famous Sushi guru would be nothing but a poser. I should have just gotten sushi from Whole Foods, that would have been fresher and tasted better."}
{"text":"I'm from S. Cali where the Sushi options are plentiful. Moving to AZ I've been in desperate need of finding a local sushi spot that would be at least semi-comparable to the quality we get back in LA and at reasonable price-points. Taking in to consideration that the fish might be fresher and not previously frozen because LA has its harbors, I went to Hiro's with lower expectations so I wouldn't be disappointed. Overall, the ambiance and the sushi quality is pretty good for being in AZ. However, the prices are a bit high as to be expected being that it is located in Scottsdale and that the rent and getting quality fish so far inland from the coast would raise cost. The portions could be larger to justify the higher prices. Moreover, I don't understand WHY the bento boxes (i.e. Teriyaki Chicken & Mixed Tempura) is priced so high! For that reason, I probably won't be returning here, especially if I want non-fish options. That kind of stuff shouldn't be priced so high because it's produced locally. I would understand if it were Kobe beef or something.. but chicken? And to add insult to injury, the chicken that I received that night was a bit on the dry side. Not sure if it was an isolated incident but for the high price I expect quality or even naturally raised organic style chicken...now we're talking! Anyway, now I feel cheated in that respect. Sorry Hiro, on to the next spot!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi restaurant in Phoenix and I've tried many.  This is not the typical modern fusion type places that seem popular these days. You will have the legit Japanese style sushi restaurant experience.  The quality and freshness of the fish is top notch.  Be sure to check out the specials on the board for some out of this world flavors.  I got both maki rolls and sashimi and loved them all.  The spanish mackerel was wonderful.  The fish was neatly presented and they even deep fried the leftover bones and head which was 100% edible and super tasty in the vinegar sauce.  I'll be sure to come back here again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We came here in search of good sushi based on yelp reviews.  It's very hard to find a place that compares to the sushi you can find in the San Francisco Bay Area.  It's comforting to see Asian families eating here and Asian sushi chef's.   The food was very good and the fish tasted fresh.   The place was small and we couldn't tell if the place was open, but the decor was nice and not Americanized.   I will definitely coming back here for sushi."}
{"text":"I'll sum this place up in one word -\"hamachi-kama\". Or is it two. I don't know for sure, my Japanese is very limited. What I do know is that it is without a doubt one of the best things that I've had there. For those of you that don't know, it's charcoal grilled yellowfin collar. The collar is the part of the fish just behind the gills and forward of the pectoral fins and is one of the most neglected part of the fish, at least here in the States. Ours came grilled to perfection, crunchy on the outside, silky soft and delicious inside. Another high point was mackerel 3 ways- two marinated pieces of nigiri sushi, as a carpaccio salad, and then finally the skeleton coated in rice flour and deep fried as a bone cracker.  I could go on, but words can't do it justice. To find out for yourself just how good this place is, walk in, ask to be seated at the bar, and ask your \"Itamae\" (sushi chef) \"Omakase onegaishimasu\". The phrase means \"Please astonish me\" or \"Please give me your best\". It puts you in the chefs hands and he will bring you the best he has to offer, often times not even on the menu.  To accompany your dinner, ask for one of the cold, unfiltered saki's. Subtle and so much better than that heated swill that people drop in their Sapporo."}
{"text":"hands down the best sushi in the valley and some of the best that I had throughout the world. Who would have thought that from a little sushi shop in the desert?  Fresh fish flown in. Lots of non-sushi authentic dishes (try the Dynamite. You're welcome) and an impressive list of sake."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday... In fact we just left there and I just have to say..this place is AWESOME! We both come from Hawai'i and have never had sushi this good since we left home! The staff is awesome,great great service.. And the sushi chefs are on POINT!! Defiantly coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much the only sushi restaurant I will go to in the Phoenix area. It's authentic and the quality of the fish is just amazing. It literally just melts in my mouth.   I've gone alone here to eat some lunch and got immediately sat at the bar. The service is quick and friendly. I just love watching the sushi chefs cut up all the different slices of fish. The lunch sushi combo is very generous and fills me up. I usually also order some steaming hot green tea. Whenever I close my eyes, I sip some tea, and let the Japanese that the staff are speaking to each other just wash over me. I can forget for just a moment that I'm living in the desert and I'm transported back to when I visited Japan.   If I could afford it, and if I didn't live too far, I would eat here as much as I could."}
{"text":"A plus sushi in the desert! Fantastic staff, always make us feel very welcome, extremely accommodating with our 2 year old, who absolutely loves the Cali rolls and salmon sashimi. Best sushi in town by a country mile"}
{"text":"Came in to this place while I was in Scottsdale this weekend. It was recommended to me by some friends.   First, what can I say! Probably some of the best sushi I've ever had! Phenomenal taste and blend of flavors. Good quality fish selected for the sushi, and everything blended together nice, it didn't taste like eating rice, seaweed, and fish seperately like other places.  The place is smaller so come earlier or right when they open to avoid waiting.  The sushi is reasonably priced, and service was fast and great!  Highly recommended if you want to try something different than the norm (RA/Stingray)  in Scottsdale .  Ill be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Just okay. We had two rolls, but the rice was just okay. We didn't try any specialty rolls, which I heard they are known for."}
{"text":"Weeknight, Hiro Sushi was crowded.    Greeted by the Sushi chefs as we entered.  Back at you, whatever you said!  Sat down, ordered copious amounts of delicious sushi, sashimi and sake.  Stopped eating long enough to look around and realize we were the only non-Asian table in the restaurant.  Great service.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best fish in town for sushi.  However,  anyone else notice that the standard type rolls (yellowtail, salmon, etc) went from 8pc to 6pc?    That would be OK if the 6 pieces were as large as the original 8, but they are not.  It leaves me and my wife needing to order an entire extra roll just to eat the same amount as previously served.  I would have preferred a couple dollar price increase to get the original quantity of food.    The fish is great and the service is great, but the value has diminished and caused me to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best sushi restaurant in the Valley. I have eaten in sushi bars all over the world, including Tokyo, and this place is rivals the best of them. The sushi chefs are what you expect sushi chefs to be, Japanese. The presentation is perfect, the staff is friendly; you're greeted by the entire staff when you walk in and receive a farewell when you leave. I have been to this restaurant on numerous occasions and have never been disappointed. Before finding Hiro I spent years trying different sushi bars, and now this is the only one I will go to.  Tip: try the Uni"}
{"text":"friendly staff and some good rolls. Not my favorite place in the greater Phoenix area but definitely up there. Hiro gets pretty busy on the weekends so making a reservation is recommended."}
{"text":"I really love this place. This is my second visit for lunch and man this place gets packed. The first time we beat the rush so the service was a little better. We sat at the counter  both times which is better during lunch if there are 2 in your party. It seems like you get your sushi faster.  We got a wash cloth the first time but not our second visit. I think it was too busy.  So far we have ordered the spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, unagi, tobiko, and soft shell crab (spider roll)  that's what they call it. The only item I didn't really like is the spider roll, I have tasted better.  I wish I live closer to here but I don't."}
{"text":"After years of eating mediocre Japanese  food in Arizona, I've finally found a place worth going back to again and again. From the outside it's nothing impressive, but it was packed on a Friday night. The steak tarriaki, was great and the miso soup was the best I've had in years. if you're  in the area, give it a shot."}
{"text":"OMG! The best! I ordered  box lunch. Amazing but ordered California Roll on the side. I kept asking. Wheres Cal. Roll? Waitress said, the sushi bar customers are priority before you. Not fair! I want to eat my meal together. They should have told  me..UGG!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem.  Had the sashimi lunch combination and received an ample selection and amount of sushi.  It was the sort of sashimi you would expect to receive in a high-end sushi bar.  Service was great.    The only drawback is that the restaurant is small, and that it fills up quick, so you may have to wait for your table.  But the wait is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Had Okinawan soba today for lunch, it was amazing!  3 other people had the same and it was 101degrees outside."}
{"text":"Japanese chefs, top notch sashimi, affordable neighborhood sushi place! 5/5  I'd lived in Japan before and this place can beat those in Tokyo! If you go to Hiro, you have to order their sashimi. We always order scallops sashimi, yellow tail, salmon, toro sashimi and uni (sea urchin)! Their rolls are amazing too. All sashimi comes in a big-fat-lap portion! Very fresh! The service is great too."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever! We loved the spicy mussels for an appetizer. My husband loved the Dback roll. I ordered the sashimi dinner, which came with delicious miso soup, a house salad with ginger dressing (sooooo good) and warm rice. The sashimi was so fresh. Wow! We'll definitely be back! Friendly chefs, attentive staff and great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"if you want the real deal sushi - go here  if you want the Scottsdale sushi, prepared by hack chefs, go to sushi brokers  this is the real deal, and shut the front door because no place is better.  every time I go here is a culinary experienced prepared by chefs, presented by chefs and  set a standard by chefs..  otherwise go to brokers and tell me you had warm sushi @ 'happy hour prices'"}
{"text":"The whole service staff had attitude right from the get-go everyone seemed in a bad mood our Korean sushi chef was the worst he sat there and talked about me and my boyfriend in front of us laughing to his friend I felt so uncomfortable we left immediately!! I will never eat there again ever!"}
{"text":"It was the absolute best sushi I've ever had, and I've been to a lot of sushi places. The service was amazing and waiting time was just 33 seconds! I ordered the smoked salmon and the crab which were heaven. Thank you so much Go to Sushi!!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously priced. I paid 14 dollars for one of the rolls and there was only 5 mediocre pieces on the plate. The overall bill was 81 dollars and my boyfriend walked out hungry. I've never really been frustrated with food pricing but this place is crazy. For that amount of money I could have walked out with plenty leftovers from any other \"expensive\" Scottsdale place.   Also, the place is tiny so expect to rub elbows with people. The waitress seemed nice initially but god forbid you actually ask her to bring you anything and she makes a face like you ended her whole world.   Definitely will not recommend to anyone nor will I ever return."}
{"text":"When i have sushi, I always base my ratings on the freshness of the fish. If it's not fresh, it's not for me. Also, in Japan the most popular fish is Maguro or Tuna. Hiro Sushi serves only the freshest fish available. The Maguro sashimi was excellent! I have also tried the dinner combo which is good for the non sushi eating crowd. It's a small restaurant so arrive early to guarantee a seat. Fortunately, we arrived 10 minutes before the restaurant opened and we were NOT the first in line."}
{"text":"I really like Hiro Sushi- The atmosphere is traditional, none of that hyped up IMAGE you get at some of other \"Social sushi\" places- This place is about the food. Period.  I usually come twice a month, the fish is always fresh, and service is top notch! When I drop on in, its usually for the Chirashi.  Their miso soup is lovely, nice pieces of tofu and none of that watered down colored broth stuff. I wish their wasabi had a bit more kick in the crotch heat to it, but otherwise its great! I'll keep coming to this place for sure!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets. From the outside it appears uninviting but once you go inside you will be hooked. The sushi chefs have experience and skill. The waitresses and hostesses are professional with upmost respect for the customers. Although I am not a sushi expert, I have had my share around the country and this is 5 star sushi. Fresh, perfect portions and high quality presentation."}
{"text":"We love this place. Best sushi around..even got to see a few SF Giant players in having sushi. They said its there favorite place.  If u love sushi you will love this.."}
{"text":"After my last review which states our $100 cost of a lunch for two (ok...we tried a ton that day)....I wanted to follow up with our visit for a birthday dinner last night. Three of us dining. We each ordered dinners. Two beers for my husband and hot tea for us. $87 total. It was a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"We have going to Hiro sushi for over 10 years. My husband and l love the intimate atmosphere and excellent sushi. You will need reservations when you have a group of 4 or more or you will be waiting a while. If you are a party of 2, you can always squeeze in at the bar."}
{"text":"Wow! An all around amazing experience. Their rolls are nothing short of perfection, and their nigiri is to die for. I would give this place seven stars if I could. I definitely would come back to Hiro, and I strongly recommend this restaurant for any special occasions, or for a fun night with friends. Definitely stay for dessert and order some amazing mochi. It's creamy on the inside, and soft on the outside. Amazing place!"}
{"text":"So, we decided to come here because of the reviews and well, I wasn't very impressed, especially after such a long drive.   I was content with the sashimi and happy that they didn't charge extra when they served extra hamachi, but was a little irritated with the rolls. The cucumber rolls were dry, and the spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail rolls were mediocre at best. Overall, the quality of their sashimi was good, but you'll have to pay for it.   A little to over priced for what we ordered. Probably won't be making a second trip here unless we are in the area."}
{"text":"Found my new favorite sushi spot. Before yelp directed me to Hiro I was complaining that there was no sushi place that I loved around here. The atmosphere is calm and homey. Everything we ordered looked and tasted phenomenal. We ordered the Arizona roll which was cucumber wrapped, the sauce that came with it was so delicious we kept dipping our other food in it after the roll was done. We also ordered the Sedona roll, crispy spicy tuna, edamame and sea weed salad. I would recommend all of these items and I can't wait to go back and try more !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi spot in town. Authentic and fresh !!   This is not your typical scottsdale fusion sushi place with all the nice decor, chic ambience with fancy cocktails. Instead you will find this a solid family business restaurant with clean interior, fresh and authentic sushi. The owner and head chef is always there and you will often find quite some japanese regulars hanging there. Isn't this always a good sign to tell if the food is authentic ;)   Both the nigiri and rolls are good. Try their scallop and must have is salmon. They have the freshest in town. Uni (sea urchin) is always fresh there too."}
{"text":"Well above average neighborhood sushi joint.  I have had very nice quality fish here.  But potion can sometime be a bit on the small side."}
{"text":"Another good neighborhood sushi place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here.  Miso soup, sunomono, and Las Vegas Roll were very good; Arizona roll, just okay; house salad, not so good.  Ambiance is...well, there isn't really any. Service is great.  I'd go here again if in the area, but there are equally good sushi places all over the Valley."}
{"text":"I grew up in sunny California eating a ton of sushi and loving every minute of it. When I moved to Phoenix I was resigned to the fact that my sushi days were probably over. I was not a fan of the chain sushi restaurants so many people rave about and frequent. I rate my sushi bars by the quality and the interest level of the food and not their creative roll names or multiple uses for mayo and imitation crab. Hiro sushi has put my sushi yearning heart to rest. The fish is fresh. The specials board is full of really interesting and different options. We encountered multiple people who frequent the place on a weekly basis and they informed us that the boards are always changing and they have never been disappointed. All in all I walked out of there full and excited that I was not going to have to drive to the coast for my fix!"}
{"text":"Very traditional and fan-freaking-tastic.  Great specials,  shima-aji and kohada!  I need to go here more often."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty good I came the other night with my husband and they had great sushi but the service wasn't great and the wait was long. It's okay!"}
{"text":"One of the few sushi places in Arizona I've gone to that I couldn't stop thinking about for hours afterwards (and the next day!). And that includes the long drive home from Phoenix to Tucson. I found this place after yelping it and boy were Yelpers spot on.  I don't know if it's on the menu but we got the \"Chef special.\" Pretty much it consisted of us asking the sushi chef what's good there and he said he'll take care of us. If I have time, I'll post pictures but we received a whole array of fresh fish (nigiri, roll, and sashimi), including monkfish pate, and they were all amazing. I think the stars of the night were the Spanish Mackerel (tasted like a fatty Salmon) and the Toro, but honestly, you can't go wrong with any of them.   Bill was about $50/person but we didn't order any drinks. I think it's totally worth the price though.  P.S. I guess there was another dish that wasn't on the menu called the \"lollipop.\" The patrons next to us got it and it looked delicious. We were too stuffed to order one at that point but in the future I'll be sure to try it. Also, it may help to call in reservations. We went on Sunday night at around 7pm and they were still packed."}
{"text":"My fiance and I are from NY where you never struggle to find sushi, so I was skeptical of finding a great sushi place in AZ.  BUT..this place proved me wrong!  It was very authentic Japanese and the sushi was incredible.  Extremely fresh, melt in your mouth, sushi.  And great service.  The place was bustling and the sushi chefs, Hiro included, seemed to know all the regulars!  Definitely a place to try if you are visiting and a place to frequent if you live in the area."}
{"text":"if you've grown up eating japanese food this place will bring back great memories! every thing is delicious and the restaurant is very comfortable. don't get rolls! instead treat yourself to some real japanese food, sashimi. ask the chef for what's good, trust him he does it for a living."}
{"text":"So, my friend and I went first to Yasu because we heard it was great. We were traveling on business and therefore using company plastic. So, we show up and the kid working the door says in a very \"Spicolli-like\" voice, \"uh.... our credit card machine is broken tonight\"..... So we replied that we were on expense accounts and would there be any way they could manually run our credit cards... The guy replies, \"dude, you're outta luck\"....  Funny, considering that I am a guy who eats out a lot and am not afraid to spend a lot of money in a place when the food and service is good... I wont be going back in there...  So we made our way to Hiro..... We were pissed and hungry after driving around and dealing with idiots all over town. Hiro was just what the doctor ordered. We sat down and were greeted and served drinks right away. We put our sushi order entirely in the hands of our chef who did not disappoint. He brought out order after order of fresh delicious sushi and sashimi... We had beer, sake and a great night.... When it was said and done, we spent about $250 for the two of us which was a lot but well worth it..... I'm sure you could go and have a great meal for much less, but we were going big and NOT PAYING!!!!!  Morale of the story is that Yasu's children working that night ran us out and straight to their competition where we will be spending money in the future... Go check out Hiro!"}
{"text":"Let me join the chorus of people who are singing the praises of dining out on sushi at Hiro Sushi!    I just love the Kani (crabmeat) and Ebi (shrimp) sushi because it is fresh, tasty, and the chefs make it for me to order sans nori (seaweed).    We've tried a number of items on the hot menu, but come back primarily for the sushi and the friendly service -- from the hostess to the servers to the sushi chefs to the bus staff... just lovely.    We go early to ensure we get seated.  Try it out!  You'll become a fan."}
{"text":"Took sushi to go was very very good sushi just filters little bit pricey but still reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great menu selection & service. Waitress was charming & helpful. She recommended fresh wasabi octopus which was the highlight of our meal. Served raw, with fresh wasabi wrapped nigiri. Texture was a surprise (squishy eyeballs) but wonderful. Spicy baked mussels were a curdled mess but my dinner companion enjoyed them very much. I was also not thrilled with the monkfish liver pate (ankimo). But again, my more experienced companion thought they were wonderful."}
{"text":"Hiro makes the best sushi in Phoenix, period. The fish always tastes fresh. It's not mushy and frozen in the middle like most sushi you find in Arizona. The tempura is light, fluffy, and seasoned. Most of all, it doesn't taste like it belongs on an onion ring. The calamari is tossed in a light sauce that elevates the dish from good to awesome. If you like sushi that is deep-fried five different ways and stuffed with cream cheese, this is not the place for you. If you like fresh fish, bold flavors, and a friendly staff, go to Hiro. The long line of people clamoring to get in on any given night is a great indication of what to expect once you get in."}
{"text":"First review on Yelp because it's just so extremely frustrating to deal with shitty service. Just visiting Scottsdale with my family, looked through Yelp for a Japanese restaurant and was excited to come here due to all the great reviews. When we walked in, the host was great, extremely friendly. When we were greeted by our server Judy, she had an attitude & was rude. I noticed that it was an added gratuity of 18% for parties 6 or more. My family and I were 6 altogether. From the get go, I knew I would be unsatisfied with the service. She got our drinks & when we were going to order, she was rushing and had the attitude like \"I've got better things to do than stand and take your orders\". There were 6 of us, after every person she would say \"is that all?\" Like hello, you see 6 or us. Do you think only 2 will order while the rest just sit here & look pretty? Nope. Rude, unacceptable and unprofessional. I'm a server as well and could care less if you're having a bad day. You work for you tip, you're not entitled to it. If this wasn't an added gratuity I wouldn't have left more than 10%. All in all, the food was good, service was unacceptable, I was highly disappointed and will not be back."}
{"text":"Best Sushi place I've been to, great food without the snobby ''sushi is so trendy' attitude and blaring music.  The staff is so friendly, the sushi is affordable --- we go there once or twice a month! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"A regular for 15 years but their new host was rude enough to guarantee they won't have my business for the next 15. Can't spend enough to get respect, I guess. Simply stated, \"wrap it up\" is not an appropriate phrase to use on a customer who waited to be seated at a table and dropped $150 on a Wednesday in celebration of her father's birthday."}
{"text":"Place is good!  Go check it out!  Restaurant, not much to it, very basic, small, but the sushi is excellent!"}
{"text":"Yummy sushi, reasonable prices and fresh.  Staff and chefs super friendly, will return!"}
{"text":"Small space . .Great food.short wait.friendly staff. Friendly patrons, who obviously love the place. Will certainly be back next time I am in town"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious and fresh sushi, probably the best in the Valley. I even got to try Jelly fish which was surprisingly scrumptious. I recommend having a reservation as we luckily got a seat at the bar on a Tuesday evening but I'm sure it's only busier on the weekends and I can see why."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy the sushi here.  It's not the best sushi I have ever had (I use to live in CA and WA), but it is the best out here in Arizona!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places.  Gets really crowded and its not very big though.  Not good for a large party."}
{"text":"Very surprised at our experience given all the favorable reviews on Yelp. We ordered rolls mostly and found them mediocre and some even \"fishy\" tasting, not fresh."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. I was at the restaurant at 5:15 with my family to celebrate birthday of my 8 year old birthday. The staff said no reservation no table or take your family to bar area. It is really sad that the service to the customer is not important especially when the restaurant is empty."}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh and service is great.  I just wish the place could accommodate more people.  Sometimes the wait isn't worth the time."}
{"text":"Love searching out great sushi wherever I go.  This definitely hit the mark. These days so many sushi places are not very authentic - this is clearly staffed by Japanese who know what they are doing!  Very small - so call ahead."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan :)  Wow, this place is SMALL. Far smaller than I expected, so be prepare to wait on a busy weekend night. Big selections of menu from appetizers to sushi, to entrees, and noodle dishes. We sat by the inner edge side of the sushi bar, and was greeted warmly by the sushi chef across from us.  We shared the Pork Katsu (probably one of the best from my memories of having this, it was fried to the golden color with white(?) meat inside, so delish!), Shrimp Tempura roll (good, like most of other place), Tuna Sashimi (we can taste the freshness, yum!), and Eel nigiri (decent, but prefer the ones at Sakana with much bigger size of the fish). The rice used for the sushi is a bit to the sticky side, but we both liked.   Service was a bit slow on the other side, my friend had to ask for water for a couple of times; overall the food was tasty. I'd definitely go back to check out more of the menu. btw, did I mention how much I liked the Katsu? I'd just go back for more of those! LOL"}
{"text":"I've been to Hiro before and while I admit that the sushi is fresh and decent, it wasn't mindblowing by any means.  The reason why I'm giving one star though, is because my brother made reservations to eat here and we didn't get to because upon arrival, we waited 15 minutes for our table to \"clear up\" and then we were told that it would be at least another 20 minute wait.  It's obviously good enough for it to be crowded, but customer service was beyond horrible - what's the point of a reservation if you have to wait over 35 minutes for a table that was supposedly reserved?  And when I told the host we were leaving, he could not have cared less, nor was he remotely apologetic. . . I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have lived in Los Angeles for over 20 years, and visited Phoenix on a house-hunting trip.  I made the mistake of eating at Ra (Gilbert, AZ) the night prior, and was having second thoughts of moving to the area...  ... that is, until I ate at Hiro.  What a relief!  Real Japanese sushi in the middle of the desert!  Where other Scottsdale sushi places distract you with unnecessary sauces or overly loud music, at Hiro the fish speak for themselves.  Recommend: yellow tail and salmon nigiri / spicy ribbon roll  Try: Orion beer (did you know the US versions of Kirin/Sapporo/Asahi are all NOT brewed in Japan?  Don't believe me?  Read the label.)  Plan to try next: Arizona roll / Okinawa Noodles  I will be moving to Chandler, but will gladly make the drive here for all my sushi needs."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for the best sushi in Phoenix.  They have the freshest quality followed by excellent service.  My favorite is the pickled wasabi which most japanese restaurants don't even know what it is.  Very good hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar) This is a must try place."}
{"text":"I've tried sushi one time before this place and I wasn't pleased. I give everything a second chance and this place was well worth the second try! I walked out of there stuffed, and loving some of the sushi I wasn't a fan of at my last place. The waiters and waitresses are fantastic! They are all very courteous, caring and know how to treat their customers! I'll be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Love this hidden gem. The place is tiny but the service and food is memorable. I seriously have no idea how people find this place, it is always busy. You can make rsvp which I highly recommend especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"It's become my \"go-to\" sushi restaurant when I'm in the Northeast Valley. Everything from the sushi to the service is great. I highly recommend Hiro to anybody."}
{"text":"Sushi/sashimi is always fresh, the service is good. If they want to increase sales they need to improve on the details of the rest of their menu. I.e meat, chicken dishes as they are just ordinary. Stick with the Sushi/sashimi - great stuff...and get there early....plenty of parking."}
{"text":"As Manhattan sashimi snobs, we were surprised to find this restaurant in Scottsdale.  While not up to top NYC standards, it was definitely reliable for an enjoyable and solid Sushi and sashimi meal.  The rolls were top quality utilizing local fresh ingredients.  The ankimo was excellent.  Staff was kind."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Fresh, thick slices of fish with perfectly cooked rice and genuine Japanese flavors. A true hidden gem"}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant several times and each time we really enjoyed the food here.  The wait can be long as 45 minutes or longer but worth it."}
{"text":"This is by far my (and the hubby's) favorite Japanese place in the Valley. The sushi rolls are typical of what you would find in just about every other \"sushi joint\" but what sets Hiro apart in my opinion are the non-sushi menu items. It is reminiscent of my experiences in Japan - Okinawa Soba, Nabeyaki Udon and mushroom tea pot soup to name a few. And if you consider yourself an adventurous eater and really do want sushi/sashimi ask for \"omakase\" and the chef will whip up some off-the-menu items sure to make you smile. Oh and the staff is worth getting to know if you have some time to chat a while. (Hint: they have lives outside of the restaurant. Go figure!)"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Phoenix area!  I originally heard about this place from a sushi chef at another restaurant.  I asked him where he went when he wanted sushi, and he said to Hiro!  The best thing about Hiro Sushi is that the average customer has a sophisticated palate, so they can offer all the exotic stuff nobody else has.  If it is your first time, sit at the far left of the sushi bar (that is where the owner, Hiro-san does his work).  Tell him you are \"at his mercy\" and see what he gives you!"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be my best Japanese restaurant, now the old owner is not there most of time. We went to the restaurant this Saturday evening,we called for reservation at 5:30 pm for sushi bar,she told us sushi bar is only first come first serve. We arrived there before 6:pm,She wrote our name on the waiting list and another guest Tony's name was behind us,but when the bar table was clear, she called Tony's name in stead of us.We protested, She said Tony was working there,and he called one hour before. She didn't apologize to us, they seated us 10 min later.The quality of service is no longer like before.  Unhappy Jenny"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this place.  I have eaten here many times and have never had a bad meal.  As a matter of fact, I ate there one night, and the only way I can describe the meal is that it was magical.  Every bite was amazingly delicious, and every dish was better than the previous one.  I took one of my co-workers from Japan there for lunch one day and he said it was just like being in Tokyo.  High praise."}
{"text":"AMAZING sushi! Sat at the bar and asked the sushi chef to surprise us with something...and he served us this HUGE roll with LOTS of raw fish on top (yummy!). Never be nervous to ask them to do that because they definitely know what they're doing. It was delicious...and so were the other rolls!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's fine. Maybe this is great sushi for Arizona, but I really wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi in Arizona! Always fresh and that chefs are fantastic! I moved here from Santa Barbara California so my fish standards are high! This place is the only place on par with SB!"}
{"text":"What an amazing hidden gem. Quality of ingredients is through the roof here some of the best fish I've had in AZ. Very authentic feel on the inside and great rotating specials.   Pricing for what you get is very good. You get what you pay for with sushi but I felt that this was a big value.   Will be a returning customer for a long time."}
{"text":"love it best sushi on the planet great service good crowd servers very helpful with menu the best highly recommend"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Hands down some of the best sushi I've ever had - everything is fresh and thoughtfully made. The sushi is great (the scallops are amazing), they have some unique rolls on the menu and the service is outstanding. It's a very small place which I love and I think it adds to the authenticity. The chefs greet and say thank you to all who enter and leave. Can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Japanese restaurant in Arizona.  Whether you're bored with the ubiquitous maguro, california rolls, etc., or just looking for a great bowl of Okinawan noodles, this is your place.  Besides, where else can you find shiokara?  Order from the specials board for the best variety of tastes,  Or you can do what I do and let the chef make whatever he thinks is best.   Sometimes the ex-pat sitting next to you is a celebrity in Japan who is in AZ to anonymously enjoy a little golf.  And if you're a baseball fan, stop by during spring training; you may be sharing bar space with more than one major leaguer."}
{"text":"Everything was AMAZING. We sat at the bar with the chefs making everything in front of us. We asked he serve their favorite rolls and went with a couple. My favorite was the Hiro Roll - I highly suggest anyone trying it. I was disappointed they didn't have a happy hour and the prices were more than I expected them to be but overall it was amazing. Also try the pickles wasabi!! So amazing. We will definitely be back once we have more of a budget"}
{"text":"Great sushi without the fluff.  It's kind of nice to find a cozy sushi bar in scottsdale.  =)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the other sushi joint was closed.  Fortunately, I found Hiro sushi within 6-7 mi. of the original one.  Thanks yelpers!  Ordered the sashimi and the chirashi for lunch.  I had the chirashi.  The fish was fresh, there was a nice variety and the portion was decent.  Reminds me of Sugarfish in LA.  Only complaint is that it's in the suburbia part of Scottsdale.  Would have been a regular spot if it were more centrally located.  Will return!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I was so excited for another great sushi restaurant to try. After reading the rave reviews, we decided to go in on two occasions and try the sushi, but both times it was just so-so. Nothing stood out and nothing was any better than the other sushi places in the area.   On another occasion we decided to try takeout and had the chicken katsu thinking that maybe the cooked food was where people were blow away, but we enjoyed this even less than the sushi.   Needless to say, we likely won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a great place for sushi. It's always fresh and tasty. They have one of the best seaweed salads in Phoenix. They are also have inari which is a fav of mine and very difficult to find around here. I'd recommend the veggie roll as well. I never eat tempura or teriyaki so I can't comment on those selections."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in town! My wife and I have been dining at Hiro for 13 years and still make it one of our favorite date night destinations."}
{"text":"We only tried the sushi, and we tried the restaurant three times.  Where are these raves coming from?  We found it overpriced and undistinguished, as good let's say as the sushi in Fry's supermarket.  No, we won't bother giving it another chance."}
{"text":"Well, actually I give Hiro a 4.5, but I did now know how do give a half-star. No matter, Hiro is fantastic.   We were driving from Flag back to our hotel in Phoenix and reached out to Yelp and this paid off big time. We were directed through the darkness of Scottsdale, to a very non-descript place and there is was: the friendly facade of Hiro Sushi.   We had the usual: miso, salad, rolls, and tempura. The quality was without doubt, and the service was without flaw. The welcoming interior made us feel right at home, with a desire to linger long after the meal was done. There were other patrons enjoying the experience in the same way we were. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Brief Review:   Just OK.  Feedback on rolls primarily.  Too few options. Rolls smaller than most at this price point. Hiro Roll presented as raw roll but the frying cooked the fish.  Service good and sushi chefs quick in response and friendly."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this place! Everything was more than perfect, from the friendly hostess, to the hard-working bus girl (she was GOOD! Our drinks were always filled, and as soon as we finished a plate she took it almost immediately), as well as the awesome service from our server, and lastly, everything we ordered was so so SO good.   Everything was so fresh, and so tasty, just imagining it all is making me hungry for it all again. The calamari came, and my fiance and I looked at it kinda freaked out but then as soon as we tried it we couldn't get enough. We got a few different rolls, and they were all perfect.   I believe this is now going to be our go-to sushi spot from here on out. Will definitely be coming back and will DEFINITELY be recommending this to everyone."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Japanese restaurant in the phoenix area. The chefs are actually Japanese, where most others are Chinese. The prices are very reasonable and the selection of dishes it great with seasonal specials as well.  Great atmosphere and service!"}
{"text":"The Chart House in Scootsdale has a great menu for two for $50.00.My friend and I were very happy with the menu and the food. The coconut shrimp appetizer was excellent and the Mud pie was very large and out of this world. Great ambiance and good service"}
{"text":"As a North Scottsdale resident, I hate to admit it but good sushi and sashimi are kind of hard to come by.  This is not to say that there is a dearth of sushi places available, just that most places suck.  However, Hiro had been recommended by several friends and, of course, there are glowing Yelp reviews.  So it was with high hopes that a friend and I stopped by for lunch a couple of weeks ago.    As mentioned in other reviews, the decor is not much to look at.  However, I have had good luck with other sushi places in strip malls (Hana, Yen & Yasu), so this did not really affect me.  Bring on the fresh fish and I'll forgive just about anything.  And Hiro delivered on this front.  The Toro was delicious and the Uni was just right.  We also took a run at the Hiro Roll, thinking that the restaurant's namesake roll would be a shining example.  Unfortunately, the flavors did not quite meld for me and the eel sauce was anything but special.  Perhaps it was the asparagus  . . .  I addition, I was not really impressed with the the flavors in the miso soup - it kind of felt like they were just going through the motions here."}
{"text":"Every year when I am in town for Barrett-Jackson I have dinner here at least 5 times!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for fresh RAW fish.  You get what you pay for.  The price can be high if you like to eat lots of rolls and/or lots or sashimi.  This is not a buffet style place.  The sushi chefs behind the counter acknowledged my fiancee and I as we entered and as we left the restaurant.  Their mackerel was the freshest I have ever tasted and I'm from the New York, New Jersey region.  The mackerel had a soft texture and neutral taste, I'm imagining that it was delivered and prepared the day that I went.  I also ordered the salmon sashimi and the spicy salmon roll; both of which were excellent.  If you want a buffet, another restaurant near by will do.  But if you want to savor every bite and you want to really taste fresh fish then I recommend Hiro.  Can't wait to schedule another visit, which reminds me pay day is near....."}
{"text":"My husband and I have both loved sushi for a very long time.  We've eaten at quite a few of the sushi places here in town.  A friend recommended Hiro and we tried it about ten years ago.  It's still the best sushi in town in our opinion.  You can find places that offer bigger rolls, cheaper prices and other \"lures\" but you won't find the quality of sushi at those places that you will at Hiro - consistently!"}
{"text":"I moved from Los Gatos, CA to Scottsdale in July 2011 and when I interviewed for the job I knew I had to find at least one decent sushi restaurant before I could accept the offer...maybe a slight exaggeration, but it was top on my list!  I found Hiro Sushi on Yelp and made a late night run for dinner.  The restaurant is cozy and tucked into a strip mall, so I wasn't sure what I was going to get.  When I went inside, there was a line, which I took as a good sign...and waited for my table.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and quantity of sushi.  Each roll I ate was tasty and service was very good.   I was pleased to find a great, little sushi spot and have eaten there many times in the last year...their takeout service is quick and easy too!  I may be moving back to CA but if and when I'm in Scottsdale again, I will certainly pay a visit to Hiro Sushi!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley would recommend to anyone who knows good sushi very fresh fish and very attentive service will be my regular sushi spot"}
{"text":"Stop by for a quick lunch and was presently surprised by this little sushi restaurant. The service was good and the food was good. They had asahi beer on draft which is rare find. Overall the fish tasted very fresh and I would go back! Con is that a kind of hole in the wall place..."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty and standard japanese fare. The waitstaff are really fast and a bit crazed but that's ok with me. Good sushi for Phoenix."}
{"text":"By far best sushi in town. The sushi is always fresh. The selection is very satisfying and service is good too. Had the nigiri toro, tuna roll and seaweed salad. The mochi ice cream is at the exact temperature so if you're looking for a sushi restaurant that is unnecessary on the high-end style that would be the perfect place to go. No wonder it's always full. The food is delicious at the right price with excellent service. Don't miss out this gem, you wouldn't regret it. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing!!! Our go to spot when i'm Scottsdale for sushi and Japanese cuisine!"}
{"text":"Super fresh fish small seating area so arrive early as they get very busy.service by everyone there is excellent very attentive. I think the best sushi in  Scottsdale. Very good selection of fish."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite sushi restaurant in Scottsdale! Everything about this place is awesome, from the food to the staff. I haven't found a place with fish fresher than what I had at Hiro. It's never a disappointment! Please try it!!"}
{"text":"We came here just after landing late Friday night for Spring Training.  We had made reservations for 6 at 9pm.  We showed up at 9:10pm and were seated immediately.  Our waitress could not have been any nicer and was very appreciative that we had made reservations.  I was shocked to see that the place was packed so late on a Friday night---definitely a popular place.  Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious.  I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I have not written a glowing review of quit possibly the best sushi joint this side of Tokyo... yes Hiro is that good! I have been coming here for almost 15 yrs. and have never been disappointed by the stunning freshness or the real deal approach owner Hiro takes when preparing his dishes. This isn't a typical Scottsdale \"night club\" that just happens to serve sushi... you know who I am talking about! This is a true master's class on how fish should taste!  The staff is always friendly and despite how busy they are always manages to create a nice experience. The specials are always new and very interesting and if you are feeling daring just sit in front of Hiro himself and say surprise me.... hold onto your gee!"}
{"text":"Very authentic place -Japanese speaking chefs. Ordered Okinawa soba - first time ever had that. Worth trying, strong ginger flavor. Pork ribs on top.   Chirashi (sashimi on top of rice) was good quality. Not as good as circle sushi - in Atlanta - place we usually go.   The disappointment was the \"catch of the day\" fried pompano. Butterfish. It was small, a little sad, and deep fried. Very small, not tasty. Not much to eat.   Overall a place worth trying. In a strip mall, but authentic experience."}
{"text":"Arguably the best restaurant in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area that primarily focuses on sushi/sashimi. The quality and selection of fish at Hiro Sushi is top notch. They regularly carry items that are hard to find at most other sushi restaurants in the area like sea eel (anago) and abalone (awabi). In addition to their regular selection of fish, they have a menu of special seasonal fish that changes from week to week. They put a lot of care into cutting and preparing the fish that they serve. You can also order izakaya-style cooked appetizers like yellowtail collar, fried squid legs, and fried smelt. Given the quality and freshness of ingredients, the prices are very reasonable.   The service is attentive and all of the sushi chefs are very friendly and accommodating to special requests."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They open at 5pm.  Get there a few minutes early and there is always someone hungrier than you waiting to get in first."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Countless celebrities consistently eat at Hiro - they aren't repeat customers because the sushi is bad!  We ate a variety of rolls, none disappointed. Miso soup was very good. Small area so be prepared to wait. We waited roughly twenty minutes but hostess was very friendly. The sushi bar is really cool - there is a lot of action going on and the chefs are incredibly social.   I will be returning when I go back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Very good and fresh sushi. They have some special fish too like: Madai, Shima Aji, Sake Toro, Aji, Mirugai, Suzuki, Bluefin Tuna and Toro. Nice service. Make sure sit at the bar and asked to be served one at a time. Also reasonable too for this quality of fish   They also have fresh wasabi and give a lot for only $1. Would come back."}
{"text":"I finally tried Hiro Sushi...OMG!  Now I understand why everyone I know raves about this place!  Best sushi in AZ.  Just as good as some of my fav sushi places in Southern California and East Coast!  HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The Sushi is always so fresh and they don't skimp on the amount of fish in each roll.  The restaurant has good energy, a must visit for any Sushi lover."}
{"text":"I don't know what I'm missing here....... We eat sushi at least four times a month, and to be honest. I've had better sushi at fry's!! bland rolls, no flavor. Tuna was terrible!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi best I had in Scottsdale! As good quality of fish like best in CA. Expensive but worth it. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Pretty fresh ingredients,  truly \"spicy\" when the menu says \"spicy\" (not a fake spicy if u know what I mean). Loved all 7 rolls we ordered for 2 people! The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful hole in the wall sushi place. From the outside you wouldn't know such an authentic and delicious sushi restaurant awaits you! My colleague and I sat at the bar and shared a few rolls and our favorite was the Diamondback or D roll. Excellent service too!"}
{"text":"If you want to sit at a table, you must make reservations.  Very small, excellent place."}
{"text":"RACIST!!! Bring my parents there Saturday night, waiting for 40 mins and finally there were 4 seats open at bar, the front desk guy let one white couple who has absolutely NO RESERVATION and just arrived for 10mins took the seats and we were on top of the waiting list. Well the front desk guy himself is an ASIAN as well said he is bad at math sort of crap. I'll never go there again"}
{"text":"Love this place!  One of my favorite spots to drop in for dinner while on the road.  Sushi is fresh and tasty. And, if you like teriyaki steak...it's very nice (for those who need their food cooked). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENTE!!! Small spot in the Shea medical area with fresh fish and very warming service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love sushi, so we're always looking for new sushi restaurants to try. Our usual place is Kabuki, but this surpassed it by far! We sat at the sushi bar. The servers and the sushi chefs were all really friendly. The rolls started coming shortly after we ordered. The fish was extremely fresh, we could definitely taste the difference!  We started off with the Philly roll, which we get at every sushi place we go to. Then we got the rainbow roll (my favorite, the fish was so good!), the spicy tuna roll and the Vegas roll. When the check came, we realized that they had forgotten to give us our spicy salmon roll. We brought it up to the servers and the chef apologized and made us one, no questions asked. And again it tasted awesome! 5 stars without a doubt."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious! We love their Teriyaki dinners, green tea, salads with ginger dressing and edamame. Yum!"}
{"text":"Really excellent authentic Japanese dishes. Nice atmosphere and great service. Prices are a little high but not unreasonable. :-)"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim, I really enjoyed it. The rolls are reasonably priced, most are under $10. Nigiri and sashimi were great! My biggest regret was that I didn't have room to try more things. They are usually pretty busy so we wound up sitting at the bar, it's a good idea to make a reservation. The everybody who worked there were eager to please and seemed genuinely excited and grateful we were there, which I found rather charming. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley. They pay attention to every last detail. The restaurant itself is small but cozy. This is my new go to sushi spot."}
{"text":"I'm not usually into sushi but Hiro has some very delicious food. Even at 9:00pm the place was packed, but we got lucky enough to be seated at the counter right in front of the sushi chefs. I've never had sushi made directly in front of me before so it was quite an enjoyable experience.  I was there with my boyfriend, and between us we got a caterpillar roll (eel), a spider roll (soft shell crab), a shrimp tempura roll, a lobster roll, a tuna roll, some edamame, yellowfin nagiri, tuna and salmon sashimi, and some mochi for dessert. Everything tastes great, and the staff were very friendly. My only complaint is that occasionally we had to remind the chefs that we were missing a roll or two, but it was understandable with how busy it was, and afterwards they were quick to get us our food. It was a bit pricey, though most sushi is, but we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mind blown!  Did not think you could get amazing sushi in AZ!  I will surely return!  All the dishes were delicious, service was polite and professional, and of course the sushi was great!  We had many dishes and I will post pics of them. Each were amazing!"}
{"text":"All Show & No Go! This place has all the hallmarks of a great Sushi restaurant: An army of chefs, an extensive (and expensive) menu, reservations needed for a table, people waiting 20 minutes for a seat at the bar. But the fish itself is actually very mediocre! I ordered the sushi assortment for $21 and most of the pieces were flavorless. I've actually had supermarket sushi at Fry's that tasted better than this!!! My experience eating the finest sushi in New York City and the upscale suburbs of NJ has been that the fish explodes with flavor on your tongue and practically melts in your mouth. Not here. This place is way overpriced for what it is and it left me quite angry"}
{"text":"All the restaurants I went to in Japan consistently impressed me with their superior quality of service.  Long story short, this pseudo-Japanese joint in Arizona (aka land of where you should be getting mexican food instead) seems to pride itself on consistently shitty service, horrid issue-resolution, and perpetually menopausal waitresses."}
{"text":"I've been in Arizona now for 12 years and I'd say this is the best sushi I've had here! The Salmon and Toro were so buttery and just melt in your mouth.  The spicy yellowtail roll was super yum too! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great small sushi and lunch hangout. Always friendly and fast service! A regular for me."}
{"text":"This is hands-down my favorite sushi joint in town. The fish is always amazingly fresh, the owners and staff are always friendly and the soft lull of music and clean, minimal surroundings are perfect. My favorite rolls are the negitori crunchy roll and the spicy salmon, however; everything is very tasty. If you love sushi, you'll love Hiro. Naomi Garnice gives it two-thumbs-up!!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to eating here because of the good reviews. But we found the food mixed. Also you can't really call it \"authentic\" with the selection of Sushi Rolls it offers. Most of them don't exist in Japan. I expected more from a Japanese owned sushi restaurant.   The fish itself was fresh, but the rolls we ordered were poorly made and were coming unrolled. Messy on the plate, and difficult to eat. No, they weren't overstuffed, just normal rolls, except for the Crazy Roll, which surprisingly was the best one of all. Tasty & well made.  The Spicy Tuna wasn't very spicy. The Spicy Scallop had a drop of hot sauce on it that looked so much like blood, I couldn't try it. The real crab in the California Roll was so dry that it ruined it.  The Negi Toro was tasteless, the Negi Yellowtail, the same. The Unagi  was sloppily cut. The Chirashi Sushi was smaller than other restaurants where we've eaten. Plus, they forgot my husband's order of oysters.   On the other hand, the salad was good because the dressing wasn't over sweet, and the edamame tasted fresh. Not a reason to drive to North Scottsdale for dinner."}
{"text":"Do not let the strip mall, small location deter you from visiting this sushi place.  We just went with a huge assortment of sashimi with a sprinkling of grilled mackerel and edamame.  For being in the Scottsdale area right of the 101, the sashimi was very fresh and we got the insider hookup for wasabi.  This place is a keeper."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a anniversary dinner here at the sushi bar with my guy. It's nestled in a shopping center and some place that I wouldn't have noticed but I'm glad my boyfriend picked this place out for us. They had a great selection of rolls, nigiri, and sashimi. The service was very attentive and smooth. We were able to really enjoy ourselves."}
{"text":"Got the Salmon Bento Box for lunch and Sushi / Sashimi lunch combo.  Both were very tasty.  Food took a little longer to come out but, was worth the wait.  Tempura was fried perfectly.  Some issues with service, otherwise would be 5 stars.  They gave shrimp tumpura instead of vegetable tempura.  Also ordered white tuna, but they forgot that.  Over all food was great though, quality of the fish was great."}
{"text":"Unacceptable to tell us that yes we will hold the sushi bar since you are coming in 5 minutes, and literally as you walk there server has given that spot to another group that walked in from of us. Good food but horrible service and not polite!"}
{"text":"By far THE BEST sushi in AZ! Not much by way of atmosphere. It's clean and traditional in its decor but not only is the waitstaff terrific but the fish just melts in  your mouth. I actually go at least 2 or 3 days a week and most of the time by myself after a workout. I sit at the bar and Hiro (the owner) takes good care of me! Prices are reasonable for sushi and the salad dressing is the best EVER and I am a sushi-a-saurus!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arizona. Comparable to some of the top sushi spots in San Francisco!  They have some of my favorite items, including Ankimo, Natto, Toro and Uni.  The salmon is amazing and their selection of fresh fish is excellent."}
{"text":"Great food is worth the wait- and this is beyond great food! Staff is wonderful, sushi is excellent, atmosphere is comfortable. Worth many repeat visits so that I can try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"We've tried this place several times in the past few years, and each time that we do, I end up kicking myself for giving it another shot.  I just do not understand the reviews raving about the sushi here!  Once again, the fish we had was of mediocre quality at best.  Maybe I'm just missing something here since it seems like the regular customers are able to command the best quality fish (or at least it certainly looked a lot better than what we had), but the fish just isn't all that fresh and the service is consistently lackluster.  We sat at the sushi bar and literally had to flag down the waitress to get our drinks refilled.  We had some Hamachi and Maguro nigiri, neither of which were impressive and a couple of rolls, one of which was the Negi Toro roll that I had to force myself to eat given the off taste it had.  We'd actually assumed that the sushi chef had forgotten about the Maguro nigiri and were ready to leave, but as soon as we flagged down the waitress, he presented the two pieces to us, nearly a half an hour after the last roll he'd served us when the place was less than half full.  I find it strange to hear how many other reviews mention the number of Asian people they see eating here and somehow manage to draw the conclusion from that fact that this is a great place.  That would seem to follow the logic of visiting Europe and seeing a McDonald's filled with Americans and drawing the conclusion that McDonald's is a top-notch American restaurant.  The point here is that not everyone is discerning regardless of whether they are eating their native fare and I find it difficult to believe that this would be considered a quality sushi restaurant among discerning Japanese diners given how much better quality sushi is available in the Valley.  Our last visit to Hiro will be our last and for anyone looking to find fresh, high quality sushi in Scottsdale, I would highly recommend trying Yume at the Scottsdale Promenade."}
{"text":"I used to live down the street from this place, but I never gave it a shot. I'm sorry I missed out all these years, because as it turns out.... out of all the sushi places I've been to, I was most impressed with this place. The fish was fresh, the rolls were plentiful... I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times on business trips to Scottsdale and I'm always impressed.  Excellent quality.  Restaurant is small and popular so it's best to go early or late."}
{"text":"Regularly go here for basic sushi fare. Not the best, but it's not a Scottsdale sushi chain owned by Caucasian douchebags so I'd rather give Hiro my business :) Gave 4 stars because the sushi is above average taste-wise and they do NOT have any type of happy hour specials"}
{"text":"Love Hiro. Whether it's lunch or dinner you will not be disappointed. Seating is limited so plan ahead."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I had in the phoenix area. This is a traditional japanese sushi restaurant where quality is most important vs the mediocre sushi restaurants that focus on the atmosphere first.   The fish is very fresh and the chefs prepare it very well.  I got 4 orders of nigiri (2 per order) , eel cucumber roll, mushroom teppan soup, seaweed salad.  My favorite was the salmon nigiri. The chefs were very nice too and it was fun sitting at the sushi bar.  I will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"Sunbum here with Jill eating the sea urchin. (First time for Jill)  I say this place is the best sushi place in Scottsdale Area!! Very fresh and well cut !! and great appetizers !! Go there right now and try for yourself ! Bring few people! You need to share the experience!!"}
{"text":"Really solid sushi and sashimi here. My main complaint is we asked our waitress to bring us a bunch of sushi and sashimi that the chef recommended and asked to include some of the unusual specials. The waitress asked how much we wanted to spend and we asked how much money would require something special and she said $50 a person.  After waiting about 30 minutes we get a plate of very basic sashimi - although it did taste very good. Then we received 6 pieces of sushi, which were also tasty, but it didn't seem that we received $50 worth of food considering the costs of items on the menu.   Also - we asked for a specific roll on the side and asked for avocado twice and didn't receive it both times.   I'd definitely give this place another try and order items directly off the menu but I was a bit disappointed by the experience because it seemed we didn't get the amount of food we paid for and were still hungry at the end.  Otherwise, the service is great and this seems like a good local place."}
{"text":"Descent sushi for Scottsadale.  No brown rice option was odd considering the recent health movement away from white breads, rice etc.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have to agree, as so many others have said, it is one of the best sushi places in Phoenix area.   It is a small intimate hole in the wall place with very friendly and personal staff. It's rather authentic especially compared to the many other fusion spots nearby. And their food is great! Thus far, I've tried a handful of their rolls, sushi, appetizers, and noodles. The fish is fairly fresh, the food well presented and authentic. Particularly liked their okinawa soba. The food isn't cheap, but the price is more than reasonable given the quality and portions. Typical dinner for us $20-30/person"}
{"text":"Great sashimi, everything is fresh and prepared gracefully. Not to be racist, but youve got real japanese chefs, waitresses, and patrons here.  Never knew there would be so many Japanese people in Scottsdale, AZ. One thing they can improve is to expand their sake menu, but their sushi is legit."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, the place is quite small but the wait is not too long. Food is delicious and will come back again when visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Arizona. My whole family loved it and they are pretty harsh critics usually"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. I think that their uni is always the freshest and creamiest compared to other competitors. Only place so far that gets good quality monk fish liver. Very consistent in good quality. There is always a wall of the their fresh catch of the day where you have the opportunity to try something you usually would not. They are priced very fair.   The restaurant has a very authentic feel to it all well. The staff is very friendly. The restaurant is small though and fills up fast."}
{"text":"I've been to 90% of the sushi restaurants in the Phoenix area and Hiro is always my baseline comparison. You can always tell if it's a sushi restaurant with true Japanese influence if they have good saba, hotate, and toro. Also, you can always tell if it's Americanized or not based off of how many rolls have cream cheese...out of the 18 rolls only 2 have cream cheese (and of course it's the Vegas roll and Philly roll). And c'mon they have an actual Japanese language menu, it doesn't get much more authentic than that, does it? Our routine order here is: Saba, hotate, hamachi, albacore, inari, zaru soba, hiyayakko (or agedashi tofu on a cold day), and of course a lovely, cold Gunma beer! I dare you to try that order and not walk out with a big smile on your face. To really get the full experience go with just 1 or 2 people and sit at the bar and chat with your sushi chef. Trust me, you'll have a great time!"}
{"text":"Food is good, and usual for sushi restaurant. However, Service is terrible. Four of us sat down for lunch the restaurant was only serving 3 tables at the time we arrived then slowly more customers came in. One of us didn't even receive our meal and we all had finished our orders. Bento box came our first, then each of my two rolls, then Combination plate. One roll and two hand rolls never made it to the table. We kept checking with the server and she didn't seem to have concern or urgency. We then asked to remove those so he could go grab lunch somewhere else. Still waiting on a check. Server came back ten mins later and asked if we wanted anything more! No, we needed the check when you saw one person at the table didn't get to eat. No discount on the bill for lack of service and the apology was hmmmm. 3 other customers were served sushi plates during this time. It's odd because ours was all on one ticket that they would make other plates before finishing the ticket. Worst service at a sushi restaurant I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best in town hands down! I've tried everywhere else. Don't waste your time or your pesos. Go to hiro. Yellowtail all day"}
{"text":"Great food, great chefs, great dinner experience!  I went for my birthday, and was treated to a nice chef's choice of some very interesting culinary experiences.  Our chef Leo was very fast, very polite, and very knowledgeable about the food.  They made me feel more like a guest and less like a foreigner.  To top it off, Leo did an awesome fruit carved rickshaw and served it to me with ice cream to make my night special.  Ill definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"One of my top 3 sushi places in Arizona. Can't believe I forgot to write a review, must of been because I was too busy eating some of the best sushi/sashimi in the area. If you care about quality, presentation and attention to detail come here. People wait because it is that good when they are busy. Everything is good here."}
{"text":"First visit rating!  we tried a broad sampling of the menu. Tempura, sashimi, nigiri, rolls, etc. Our go to place for Japanese as of now. More to follow... after a second or third visit.   Four or five visits later our opinions have not changed. Still THE place to go for The freshest in sushi and Asian food.   Additional visits.... best Asian in the whole area!  Oh l, did I mention my spouse is Asian?"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite sushi place in Scottsdale, great food and service, huge menu and efficient staff! Had dinner for 3 last night. We had great items and were stuffed and very satisfied!"}
{"text":"This is officially MY sushi place in Phoenix. I've traveled far and wide, tried sushi in many states, in many countries, and in many ways, but this place has it all!  The cuts aren't perfect, like they are in other places, but they are thick and of such high quality you just don't care!  The specials change based on what's fresh.  The chefs are friendly and excellent at what they do.  The servers are kind, and attentive.  I was able to get types of sushi (as well as sake and beer) that I haven't been able to find elsewhere! (at least not in the states) The waits can be long because of the high volume of people and the tiny dinning area, but they do take reservations.  I almost hate to give such a glowing review because the more people, the bigger the line! But... I must, because it's just too good! If you're a sushi novice and wanting to try for the first time - this is your place! If you're a sushi aficionado, and just like what you like, but want it better - this is your place! If you're a sushi expert and wanting what you can't find elsewhere - this is your place!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a great local sushi place in Scottsdale. I went here with my parents a few days ago as it's near their condo and we were craving sushi.  Hamachi Kama - Didn't see this on the menu, but we asked the waitress and ordered it. Perfectly grilled and super tender. A great appetizer to share between two or three people.  Okinawa soba - Loved this noodle soup dish so much. Great broth, not too salty, which delicious noodles and fall of the bone spare ribs. Excellent.  Toro nigiri - Super fatty and buttery  Sashimi sampler - I usually wouldn't order this, but my parents don't eat much nigiri and rarely eat rolls, so they ordered it. Everything tasted super fresh though.  I had ordered one of their special rolls, but the name escapes me now. I think it had spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, and something else...anyways, it was pretty good.  Service is great and the prices were pretty reasonable. Not the best sushi I've ever had, but good value. If my parents are still going here by the time I return next year, then this place is a keeper.  Go early for dinner. We went shortly after opening and were the first people in the restaurant. By six, there were only two small tables open."}
{"text":"Went here this evening with the wife and 4 1/2 year old.  Based on the reviews I was expecting better.  Don't get me wrong, there wasn't really anything wrong with the food (albeit maybe the toro) but it was no way a meal that was memorable.  Received a salad as part of a dinner entree - way too much dressing.  There was enough for 4 salads.  Miso was yummy though.  The yellow tail was very good as was the unagi but the toro nigiri was chewy due to sinew...  I don't know why we keep trying the spider roll at anywhere but Sushi Sam's in San Mateo - it was just OK.  Trying the California roll with the tempura bits was a mistake when there were so many other items on the menu.  Ordered the oysters on the half shell special and that was decent but again, not particularly special.  Price wise I'd say it was moderate to expensive.  The bill for 2 adults and a 4 1/2 year old was $115 before tip.  There was only 1 large beer on the tab.  I'm a visitor and I don't believe I'd come back again.  For the price I'd want to have a taste of Roka Akor.  Hindsight is 20-20 but that might have been the better bet tonight..."}
{"text":"Summary: Consistently snooty hostesses, great wait staff and phenomenal quality food.  I'll share the bad first since Hiro gets more than ample praise that is mostly deserved. I don't know what it is, but the hostesses at the front of the restaurant have been particularly rude and unwelcoming for the past 3/5 visits. Hiro is very busy and very small with few seats. If you haven't got reservations expect to feel like an enormous burden if you come to eat here. It honestly feels like all the hostesses are 10th grade girls who don't know how to accommodate a party without a reservation. It's as if they haven't dealt with such a perplexing situation before. I wouldn't have let this shortcoming bother me so much if the staff didn't have such poor self control. After seating our party at the bar, one of the hostesses said, \"You REALLY should get reservations if you're going to eat here\" as she walked away. We live a mile from this place and sometimes decide to eat here in the spur of the moment... It's just poor form and not the kind of attitude that should be present in a quality dining establishment.  Food-wise, I can't speak highly enough of the sashimi. The quality and freshness of the fish is apparent. i haven't explored the sushi scene in cities like LA or SF but would imagine Hiro humbly rivals the quality of the best in these culinary hot spots. Once your seated, the staff seem to all be delightful and professional."}
{"text":"Really liked their Okinawa soba. I am usually all for the sushi and rolls at a place like this but the noodle dish really was something else. Sushi and rolls, however, were just okay. The rolls may have had too much rice - it was a bit difficult to eat."}
{"text":"A lot of Yelpers are very excited about Hiro Sushi here in Scottsdale, and it is conceivable that Hiro is one of the best sushi places around. However, being from San Francisco I am not quite as taken by it. It's a good sushi place, and that's all it is. The quality of the fish seems fairly average. I did try the miso soup and shrimp tempura both of which were quite good. The caterpillar, rainbow, and philly rolls however were nothing special, although the spicy yellowtail roll was great. The service was wonderful, everyone was really friendly, and the decor of the restaurant was nice - transporting you far away from the drab parking lot exterior. The prices are fairly high, though. The special rolls such as the rainbow roll is around $13 and their famous diamond back roll is a $18! Salmon nigiri is $5.50 I think which is more expensive than a lot of sushi restaurants I've been to in San Francisco. Overall it's a good sushi restaurant and clearly deserves 4 stars here in Scottsdale, although in San Francisco I would probably only give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"this is my favorite sushi place in the phoenix / scottsdale metropolitan area.  all the sushi fish are extremely fresh and made expertly with just the right amount of rice and wasabi.   the sushi rice is also perfect, the best i've had in phoenix with the exception of the now defunct seasaw. toro is to die for, sea urchin is sweet and delicate.  sweet shrimp is succulent and juicy.  the specials always change, but are always consistently unique and excellent.   service is always friendly and warm. on top of that, the prices are reasonable.   hiro can't be beat for really good, fresh, reasonably priced sushi."}
{"text":"I've eaten sushi all over the country, and Hiro Sushi is hands down the best sushi in Arizona.  The location is a bit hidden away within the shopping center, and walking inside there aren't that many tables, but this smaller size gives more attention to the customer, and it results in great service from the staff!  I find that almost everything I order here is great. Everything is made consistently fresh and great regardless of time of year.   Hiro Sushi is also great for Japanese cuisine in general! The noodle soups and soba are other dishes I frequent, and there are excellent lunch and dinner packages that come with rice, soup, and salad.  My recommendation? Go for the specials! The fried fish and teapot soup are very light and tasty. Don't be afraid to ask for something that isn't there! Chances are if you ask the waitress they still have plenty of that favorite dish coming up!  It gets very crowded on a weeknight, so because of the small size of the restaurant, be sure to make a reservation a couple hours in advance. It's painful to wait an hour and watch people eat their fantastic food!  It's a bit expensive compared to happy hours at other places, but who eats sushi to SAVE money? Hiro is truly quality over quantity, and I have never felt I've wasted a single dollar."}
{"text":"Hiro's is by far the best sushi in town. Hiro buys his fish fresh everyday and everything is meticulously prepared. Seating is limited so reservations are strongly recommended.   As a side note, Hiro is quite the golfer, he's had three holes-in-one!"}
{"text":"Decent fresh sushi in a convenient location. The only downside is they close between lunch & dinner. The parking lot is very busy and crowded during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Great place. Hard to find decent sushi this far from the ocean sometimes, but this place was great. Lots of choices and reasonably priced lunch menu. There were people lined up outside at 1130, waiting for this place to open. Clearly, they do some great stuff."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place, full for lunch. Lots of regulars from the sounds of the way the waitresses talk with the patrons. Great food, buttery smooth nigri and sashimi. Las Vegas to was huge and just the right amount of ingredients so nothing is overshadowed, very crunchy exterior my wife really enjoyed it. Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"WOW! What a great find! When the hostess escorted us to our seats (at the bar) - I immediately glanced over to look at the fish, I could already tell the quality was on point.  The rolls are unique and there's a decent selection - just enough to not be overwhelmed. The mackerel is some of the best I've ever had!  The service is great! Attentive but not overbearing. I'd easily be a regular if I lived here - but that's not to say I'm not coming back. The quality is amazing and it is truly the best sushi I've had. You definitely get what you pay for!   Who knew you could find fresh sushi in the middle of the dessert?! It exists! SO A.W.E.S.O.M.E."}
{"text":"The negative reviews about this place should be disregarded. The ones I've read are all written by people who seem to know little about Japanese food, like not to get a deep-fried dish for takeout, what the names of things they ate are...   Hiro is world class, period. I was a NYer for 15 years, ate at several of the best places there. I've traveled to Tokyo several times, and around Japan. I had the best sushi in Honolulu at Sasabune. Hiro holds its own with any of them. Not every thing on the menu is special, true. Which is why my wife and I tend to go there when we want to splurge and get the omakase. The chefs bring out their very best stuff, and you don't know what it'll be. It's usually the best meal of the year.   We went for our third omakase meal there last night, and it was wonderful again. All the fish was exemplary, starting with the red snapper, o-toro, and yellowtail sashimi. Absolutely top quality. We also had a dish of sautéed mushrooms and grilled black cod, both of which were outstanding. There was what they call the crazy roll (delicious) and the spicy ribbon roll (also terrific.) There was the butterfish sashimi served with the fish's deep-fried skeleton. All of it wonderful. Ate every bone and morsel. Then came the nigiri, which included a wasabi octopus specialty, and frankly the only octopus sushi I've ever enjoyed. The salmon was sublime, the bluefin and albacore tuna wonderfully contrasting and delicious.   The service was very good, and we felt like two very lucky people, having one of the best meals possible. Bill for this extravagant spread came to just over $200 for the two of us, including two large beers and two glasses of wine. The same meal at Sasabune cost us $330, and wasn't really better.   If you go and want to order a special treat, try the kiwi salmon. It's a blend of raw salmon, salmon roe, and kiwi seeds. The whole thing works brilliantly, and was invented by Chef Hiro. Memorable. Go, and get the good stuff. You will not be disappointed. Unless you don't know about Japanese food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Was referred here by a Japanese family that is on a two year assignment here. If they liked it it had to be good and it was!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Arizona.  They hook you up with healthy slabs of sushi.  We always go for nigiri, shrimp tempura, our favorites include, Sake (Salmon), Uni (sea urchin), Sweet Shrimp nigiri."}
{"text":"Being from California, the sushi was alright. Nothing that blew me out of the waters. But what I did appreciate was the service and how the restaurant was owned by Japanese people (instead of the Korean-owned sushi places that is everywhere from East Coast to West Coast). Service itself was excellent. Our hostess was very attentive to adjust to even the smallest changes to our party's requests. Sushi, on the other hand, was served at a varying rate which I found a bit annoying because some people got their food really quick while others had to eat after the rest of our group had finished eating. The quality was good but I have found \"good\" elsewhere also. I'll probably give it another try after I explore some other restaurants."}
{"text":"Before I delve into my personal experience at Hiro, I will discuss the important factors of, what makes a good sushi restaurant, according to my criteria.   For credibility I've eaten sushi my entire life, everywhere from Cali to NYC to Tokyo . I believe I can distinguish between the different levels of superb sushi grade fish.   - Fish Quality     I ordered the dinner sashimi platter ($21), 2 orders of the spanish mackeral nigiri($11), 1 order of the giant clam nigiri ($11).               *The sashimi was average, and the tuna had a distinct \"fishy\" smell to it. The portions were of average size, and the layout was aesthetically pleasing. The Spanish Mackeral was OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD! I highly recommend it, albeit the cuts are small, the fish is delicious. The giant clam was overpriced based on its size and freshness.   - Rice Quality     This is pretty hard to mess up. The rice is perfectly balanced as it should be. The fish to rice ratio was good.   I went into this restaurant with high expectations, first from the high reviews on Yelp, and second upon entering the restaurant you are overwhelmed by an abundance of Japanese celebrity pictures plastered all throughout the entrance. They are all somehow affiliated with the restaurant/owner. The pictures suggest that these Japanese celebrities have eaten at this restaurant and give their thumb of approval.   3 stars because this restaurant, in regards to nigiri and sashimi, were just average. The problem with sushi reviews on Yelp is that you get a lot of yelpers reviewing based on rolls and sake bombs. It's sad but true that so many people will judge a restaurant based on how good their rolls are when the true judgment of a sushi restaurant should be in the quality of their nigiri.   I have given up on sushi in Phoenix. From now on I will get my sushi fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner and it was quite busy. We managed to find a place by the bar and it was quite charming. We ordered miso soup, Shumai and couple of sushi dishes. All of it was delicious! We ended the meal with the tempura ice cream and god was it yummy! Will definitely be goin back to this place to try out more from the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi and Japanese restaurant in Scottsdale and one of the very few if only that is Japanese owned and operated. All of the Chefs are Japanese and are well trained. The food is fresh and portions are generous. We go at least once a week and never grow tired of the food. You can also order large bottles of Sake which they will keep for you for your next time in. Hiro, Leo, Masa, EJ, Take, Kazu and Steve are fantastic chefs."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in town.  We always get the spicy tuna and the crunchy california.    I've never had a bad roll at this place.  The wait staff has never left us waiting for attention - they are all sweethearts.  Everything is priced nicely and they have specials up on the board.    Hiro, the owner, is from Japan and is typically working on the bar - they seem to be having a good time back there, rolling up a storm.  I'd recommend reservations for groups of 4 or more.  The place is small and often frequented by Japanese, which has to be a good sign.    Big beers, wine and saki are there to wash it all down.  The green iced tea is recommended as well."}
{"text":"The best sushi in town. Ate in the hundreds of sushi restaurants and this is the best one I've ever had nice mom-and-pop feel and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Hiro, Leo, Masa and Take are fantastic sushi chiefs!! The lady's that work there are the nicest ladies you will ever meet! The sushi is superb. Hiro expects perfection in the raw fish he selects. I have been going here every week or 2 since they opened in 2001!!!  Best in Scottsdale!!!  Peter"}
{"text":"Hiro offers good clean sushi in a fun hospitable environment. Hiro has been around for awhile and they make the experience fun for all ages. They always do something special if its your birthday. I wouldn't consider this place to be trendy or modern. The staff has been working there forever and they are extremely friendly. Prices are fair and the sushi is great! Give it a shot. They are usually only open for a couple hours during lunch, and then again form dinner."}
{"text":"I have worked and lived near this place for many years and remember when it first opened. They used to advertise lunch specials and happy hour to get customers in the door and oddly I never heard any comments about it until YELP.  With so many great compliments in Yelp, my hubby and I decided to give it a try.  We ordered the calamari to start and it was very delicately done but not much of it.  They have mackerel but it is called spanish mackerel--it was still very good.  We enjoyed a tasty assortment of sushi that was beautifully presented.   My only gruff is that the sushi crab is the fake Krab, but at least they note it on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm on a hunt for a new sushi place, so I drove 40 minutes to go check this place out.  My review is strictly on their food.   I drove that far, because I trusted Yelp reviews on this place.  What a disappointment it turned out to be...  Yes, they have the abalone,  and otoro which I can't find in many other places in AZ...but that's about it.  Their cut on sashimi is poor, meaning, the sashimi chef's skill is not up to par.  The fish is cut too thin, and is jagged at the edges.  Everything is over priced for what it is.  I've had much better other places such as Gilbert of all places!    I'm all for paying top dollar if what you serve me is top notch!  But this place just isn't worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 8 years, and I can guarantee this is THE best and MOST authentic sushi you will find in all of Arizona. The family is super friendly. I'm never disappointed by a meal. All of the best to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Fresh sashimi, delicious yakitori and rolls.  We drank a lot of sake, ordered about 4 rolls, several pieces of sashimi and the total came out to $80-90.  Well worth it.  I would def. come back for their sashimi."}
{"text":"What a wonderful sushi restaurant.   If you want trendy, or a place to see and be seen, head further west to Ra or Stingray.   On the other hand,  if you are looking for outstanding quality, fresh fish and attentive service, then this is your (and our) place.  Yes, it is small, but the intimacy always seems to create a special ambiance. Appetizers:  the soft shell crab with a ponzu sauce is incredible.  Last night, one of the specials was Washington oysters on the half shell; plump,  juicy, and not overly briny.  Just fresh and delicious.   All of the sushi & sashimi are recommended.   We always enjoy the negiri Toro roll, eel & cucumber roll, sesame roll, any of the clams, and flying fish roe. Sea urchin may be an acquired taste, but if you enjoy the taste of the sea, please give it a try.  We always end our meal with the tenzaru,  soba noodles with tempura served with a soy based dipping sauce (add scallions, wasabi,  and quail egg).  So, all in all, just a fabulous place.  And you'll be so well taken care of; we'll keep our favorite waitress a secret, but they're all terrific!"}
{"text":"This is the kind is sushi place I like. Small and unassuming but oh so good. People were lined up to  get in on a Saturday night. Prices are reasonable and the quality is one of the best in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is the type of place you go when you want good, no-nonsense sushi.  It's not the place you go if you want elaborate sushi rolls or fancy dishes.  I will say my edamame was perfect!  Cooked to perfection and served warm but not hot.  Since I'm more of a sushi rolls and cooked-fish type of person, I don't think I appreciated this place as much as it deserved.  But if you really like raw fish and the simpler sushi dishes, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The sashimi was definitely the best part of this meal. Other than that I was not a huge fan of this place. We had difficulty communicating our order and almost everything was incorrect. On top of that the rolls were pretty low quality. I think this place is a bit over rated"}
{"text":"Super fresh fish and always packed!  Been coming here for years and am never disappointed, well, only when they run out of King Crab ;("}
{"text":"Once again, I was craving sushi.  I read your reviews, and decided to take the small leap (if there is such a thing) into Hiro Sushi.   We ordered the Rainbow roll, Crazy Roll and Crunchy California Roll.  All were pretty good. Not great (sorry) but good.   The people that work there are darling, nice and attentive.   Maybe I\"ve had too much sushi all over the planet,or am too picky (or spoiled with killer sushi?) but this was good,  not great.   Scottsdale peeps, try Dozo...it looks like an old Jack In the Crack from the outside, but inside? Pretty. Most importantly, they have awesome sushi.  Anyone in the Chandler/Awautukee area? Try Sushi Eye (on Warner)..."}
{"text":"Hiro sushi is traditional Japanese food. They always have great specials and food yummy. No bad on the pocket book"}
{"text":"First of all, don't be put off by the strip mall locale; Hiro is the real deal. Delicious, fresh fish, artfully sushified for me ... light, crispy tempura and tasty teriyaki, generously plated for my husband and my son. Excellent service and reasonable prices rounded out the experience. Highly recommended. Dinner at Hiro will certainly be on the agenda next time we make it back to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in town. It's a tiny place so expect a wait. Always try the chef specials on the board. They are always excellent!"}
{"text":"If you want authentic, high quality sushi in the Phoenix area....look no further.  Located in a little strip mall, Hiro Sushi is not flashy, fancy, or trendy...but that's part of why its so great.  It's a tiny restaurant and its always packed, so you will probably have a little bit of a wait if you come during peak hours.  Most of the people that come here are all dedicated Hiro regulars it seems.  Once you try it, it WILL become your go-to sushi joint.  I think its always best to sit at the sushi bar so you can interact with the chefs.  Leo is the man and who I usually wait for, but they are all great guys and all very talented!  As I've said in some of my other sushi restaurant reviews, I'm a stickler for quality and freshness with my sushi.  Hiro has it nailed down here.  If its not fresh, they won't serve it.  I don't know if I can count how many things I've tried here but not a single thing stands out to me that I have ever disliked.  All of the fish melts in your mouth and all the pieces are properly sized and cut.  My recommendation is to just go and have them make you whatever is best.  They always have a sizeable amount of fish specials that they get in, you can never go wrong with one of those.  One highlight is the spanish mackrel....if they have it, order it.  It is prepared fresh, right in front of you...and it is out of this world."}
{"text":"Brand new to this yelp thing so this is my first review...I have traveled to Japan for business multiple times so I know sushi. Traditionally \"Americanized\" sushi is a whole different fare than anything found in Japan. I like this spot because it's the closest I've found...their food is amazing. Give it a try - you will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi, but not my favorite in the valley by any means. I will probably be going back in the future though at some point."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh! One of the best sushi places I've been to and the best in Scottsdale in my opinion. Hiro typically will be a busy place so prepare with a reservation. If you get a seat at the sushi bar, the chef always has great picks and suggestions! Yum."}
{"text":"This is a real Japanese sushi restaurant...I say this because there are plenty of \"fake\" sushi places all over.  We were in AZ for few days to house hunt before moving permanently and this place made us feel a little easy about moving from L.A..  *Price = pricey compared to L.A. sushi restaurants *Quality = very good (sweet shrimp was a small) *Service = very good *Atmosphere = bright and cheerful"}
{"text":"I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviews declaring this the best sushi in town.  We had a former sushi chef dining with us and he declared it \"the real deal.\"  The freshness is incredible and they have an amazing selection of rare and unusual options.  Service is perfect - plates were cleared quickly without us feeling rushed.  Our meal hit all the right notes and it's going to be hard to sushi anywhere else."}
{"text":"You can get any fresher than Hiro's in Greater Phoenix! We experienced a treat on Tuesday night when our party dined at Hiro Sushi. Thanks to the tips and recommendations of my Yelp community, we enjoyed a meal that that was better than five stars.  Tip: Make reservations, 5 pm if you can make it. There was a line forming even before the doors opened. Fortunately, we made reservations 3 weeks ago.  Even though they were extremely busy, my guests and I never felt rushed.  Now for the nosh: The hamachi or yellowtail and salmon grilled cheeks (kama) were fantastic. Flavorful and smoky from the habachi grill, the fish was tender and succulent.  We enjoyed 2 orders of spider roll (softshell crab). We also had shrimp tempura roll and a Vegas Roll.   One of the highlights of our meal was the beef teriyaki which was a steak seasoned and grilled to perfection. Everyone enjoyed a bite. It comes with rice, a cucumber salad and a delicious seaweed based salad.  We also enjoyed fresh sashimi (raw sliced fish). We had otoro (tuna belly), salmon belly (not on the menu but served up when we asked for it), and surf clam.  I thoroughly enjoyed the monkfish liver pate. It was creamy and tasty, rich with fish oils.  We were way too full for dessert. It was a fabulous evening of feasting!"}
{"text":"Wish I was capable of saying something bad but I can't!  Best sushi.  Now please make room for me at bar..."}
{"text":"Big selection of ingredients, including all of the usuals, plus types of tuna, quail egg, and sea urchin. The staff seems large for such a small space. Servers are fast and attentive, and almost all Japanese. Great place for a date or a business meeting. You quickly forget you're in a strip mall!"}
{"text":"I wish I had a bigger stomach so I could eat more of this amazing sushi! I'm so surprised by how fresh, and delicious, it all is!  Definitely try the Arizona roll - very unique. And the Spicy Ribbon roll. The tuna and salmon are so, so fresh."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review in saying that I tend to like a mix of both authentic Japanese and a little bit of Americanized cuisine as well - but when it comes to the authentic end, I'm very picky.  I went here a little over a week ago with my uncle and aunt who are both from Japan (born and raised) and they were very impressed as well by the quality of the food and service.  We ordered a couple of apps, sushi, and entrées which was more than enough food for the three of us.  The fish was very fresh, tempura was light and crispy and everything was well balanced and prepared properly.  I love their hand rolls and the cuts of fish are generous and absolutely delectable! I swear... my mouth is watering just thinking about it!  If you're looking for a place with great ambiance or amazing decor, you'll have to move along.  Hiro is modest in design, but what it lacks there it makes up for in quality and integrity of the food and service.  This place for sure has the best sushi I've had thus far here in Arizona!  Finding the place was a little on the difficult side since we didn't know exactly where it was and it's located in a strip mall (we drove past it at first).  But it was definitely worth the trip out and I can't wait to come back.  Don't be surprised at their non-extensive menu, but they are accommodating if you're looking to have something specific.  What Hiro does, Hiro does well and are very knowledgeable.  Everything I have tried on their menu is delicious and a wonderful treat! Yumminess for sure!"}
{"text":"After three long years of searching for a happening sushi place with great nigiri in Phoenix I have finally found it!  Went there last night for date night and the service and atmosphere could not have been better.  It has a really authentic feel, the chefs speak japanese amongst themselves, and they are lively to watch which makes sitting at the bar a great experience.  The fish is very fresh and the pieces (nigiri) are both generous and delicate.  Also, I highly recommend trying the ikura nigiri (salmon roe) with a quail egg. We are definitely going back.  So, why not five stars?  We ordered some friend butter fish and some fried mackerel and they both came out a little to dry and oily, but the sushi was excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night just because I craved for sushi and not knowing how sushi places taste like here I just decided on this one due to good yelp reviews. Well some of the rolls and sushi we ordered were either a hit or miss..  $4.95 2pc - Salmon Sushi was great - big fatty piece of salmon, hint of wasabi and just the right amount of rice underneath.   $5.50 2pc - Yellowtail Sushi wasn't bad either.   $4.95 2pc - Albacore Sushi - ehh not a big fan of albacore.  $12.95 Spicy Ribbon roll - consist of spicy tuna in the center and topped with salmon and avocado - liked it  $6.95 Spicy Scallop Roll - ehhh not sure I like it as a roll...usually it's the two piece with the seaweed wrapped outside and the scallops are on top. but this one is a full roll and I got tired of the taste by the third bite.   $5.95 Salmon Skin Roll - again this wasn't really good as a roll...better as a hand roll...   Overall the service was great I even tipped an additional four dollars to the sushi chef that served us at the bar and they were constantly clearing out our empty plates. The food on the other hand was just so-so...tasted semi-fresh...not like it's right out of the ocean..lol but going in I didn't expect it to taste like it's right out the ocean after all we are in the desert! This was a relatively small restaurant...it was quite busy though. The prices were pretty high....we ended up eating like $50 something dollars worth of sushi...we don't usually surpass $40 for two in California with the same amount of food and of good fresh quality. But eh I guess it somewhat curbed my sushi craving for the time being."}
{"text":"My first visit to Hiro was a delight! I came in for dinner and sat up at the bar where sushi chef Leo was really friendly and offered up some helpful suggestions.  I started with the $2 miso soup which was not watered down and had some meaningful chunks of tofu in it and was just right to warm me up on this cold AZ day. I ordered the Houston roll and the Crazy roll for my main meal and while I waited I eyed the slabs of fishmeat hungrily.  My Houston Roll was up first - really smooth fatty salmon slices with julienned cucumbers and scallions, an inside out roll. The total effect wasn't especially overwhelming, more of a palate for wasabi and soy sauce. But good quality maki for sure. The Crazy Maki is Leo's favorite I'm told, and I can see why. First of all, I have never had a soy paper roll, that was fun (and pink!).  The Crazy Maki has a tempura shrimp rolled up with spicy tuna, avocado and roe. Most restaurants make the tuna with spicy mayonnaise, but this was mayo free (i'm a mayo-phobe) and ultra silky in texture. the maki is a fattie but because it's rolled in soy paper you can eat it in bites, unlike seaweed rolls which if you try to bite will empty their contents on your shirt and lap while everyone in the restaurant stares at you. so yay for soy paper!   I have one singular criticism: the wasabi was not spicy. i was putting a quarter-sized amount on each sushi piece just to get a tingle - so I ran out quickly and didn't ask for more (what for). Have all my tastebuds died? do they make particularly weak wasabi at Hiro's? I don't know but I'm prepared to do some arduous wasabi studies at Hiro Sushi for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi....  the service is amazing just like the selection the chef has put together. Get in early, it gets busy quick."}
{"text":"Hiro sushi provides fresh and delicious ingredients to its food. First, the bento box is a great meal if u want to mix in typical Japanese dishes. If you love eel, they have a great number of dishes for you. And of course, the sushi. You can taste the freshness and flavor of the sushi. The sushi chefs cook it to perfection. Also, for drinks, the hot green tea is an excellent choice. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we found this place while on a business trip.  Who would have thought you could find quality sushi in an authentic atmosphere in the desert?  Pulling up to the restaurant in the strip mall next to a gun shop didn't start so well but as soon as we stepped in and the place was packed we knew we made a good choice.  Great sushi and cold beer is always a great combo!"}
{"text":"I came here because of the Yelp reviews.  I was a single and sat at the sushi bar and the service from both the wait staff and the sushi chef was very good (reason for a 3 star vs 2 star).  The food was average.  Maybe it was because I got some standards (Spicy Tuna roll, Spicy Salmon roll, Eel and avocado roll, and a squid salad). I don't know....the place smelled a little \"fishy\" and my dinner was reasonable but I have had better and will keep looking....."}
{"text":"Fantastic place if you are looking for authentic, make it in front of you sushi. We sidled up to the bar and watched the chef make sushi, sashimi, and other Japanese delectables. Very outgoing chef with good sense of humor and suggestions. To say we pigged out is an understatement. Everything very reasonably priced. So many options to choose from but we especially liked the crazy roll, sammy roll, crispy spicy tuna roll, California roll and the freshwater eel. Highly recommend this little secret tucked away in an unsuspecting strip mall if you are looking for fresh sushi."}
{"text":"This came highly recommend  from three friends. The service was horrible. It took one hour  and 40 minutes  for lunch. The last order came one hour after the first dish. The server forgot . The sushi was dry . My teriyaki  chicken was so dry. Prices were reasonable.  To top it off .The waitress spilled soup on my shirt and pants and backpack.maybe they had a bad day. We did like the shrimp with potato  wrap"}
{"text":"Hiro should be spelled Hero. It was that good. Super fresh. I consider myself a Sushi snob and this was superb. Great food and great price. Truly classic Japanese Sushi place. Great selection of fish and the wait time was reasonable for the quality of this place. Highly recommend a reservation as this place tends to get booked. Have a couple of large beers and some Saki while you wait passes the time really well!"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic sushi restaurant. I loved the atmosphere and engaging with the sushi chef. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This was our first return visit for years: it is a good place but there are so many to choose from. Friends and I dined from the sushi menu. It is always good and not too spendy by local standards.  My wife had the tempura dinner which included miso soup and seaweed salad as well as battered seafood and vegetables. She couldn't finish it but declared it excellent.  Except for a dramatic water glass upset at the beginning, service was excellent.  We should return more often."}
{"text":"Not much that I can say other than -- this place serves the best sushi I've had in the Valley. The fish is very fresh, the other ingredients top notch, the service impeccable and the space itself very cozy."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove in from Tucson and we were dying for some authentic sushi & that's exactly what we got! Amazing fresh authentic sushi! Great friendly service. We were greeted immediately when we walked in the door & seated at the sushi bar. This is a small spot with about 7 tables. And about 10 seats alongside the sushi bar. They have a variety of rolls for the not so pro sushi eaters and also the real authentic nigiri, sashimi rolls for the true sushi eaters myself! This isn't a fancy spot so if your looking for ambiance over quality than I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Seriously, this is the freshest best sushi I have tried. When you enter, there is no fishy smell, which means all the fish is FRESH! I love the sushi chefs, fun, funny and accommodating. If it is not on the menu, just ask and you will receive. :-) Make reservations, very buzy!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, small cozy restaurant. A little pricey but paying for great quality. Would recommend to anyone in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Fantastic hidden gem. From the outside it looks like a little dentist office, but inside is a traditional sushi restaurant, half actual sushi bar, half sit down restaurant. The sushi chefs are authentic Japanese, and the ingredients are extremely fresh. Rarely have I found a sushi joint this far from the sea that has Ahi that has ZERO fishy smell. They are flexible with adapting if you want a custom roll. One of the chefs even turned a regular ahi sashimi dish in to a rose for me and my girlfriend. The prices are fair and they have several Japanese beers that are delicious. If you are a sushi fan, you owe it to yourself to check this place out. Sit at the sushi bar, its great to watch these guys work."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in town! And trust me....I get around. To sushi bars, that is.   They have fantastic prices, very friendly staff, and great dessert and drink options.   The downside is the limited space. You'll want to go here earlier on a weekend night if you want to get a table. It's about the size of a master bedroom.   This is what you expect a truly authentic sushi restaurant to look like."}
{"text":"Brilliant!!! Fresh! Sushi!!! I'm not taking about rolls people- i'm talking sushi!!!  You can get good rolls anywhere.  This place is amazing!!  In addition, the selection of nigiri is the best I've seen around here. Also, try the Ankimo -it's delic!! Can't finish this review without telling you about the staff. Friendly, knowledgeable and excellent service even when they Were slammed!"}
{"text":"Top notch.  Might only be 4 1/2 stars in LA but far better than I have found  in most American cities.  Order the special catch or have the usual if that is how you roll.  You won't go wrong."}
{"text":"I can't think of a better sushi place I've been to in Az... Tried them tonight for the first time.. A whole in the wall and OMG the best ever! Everything so fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot of ALLLLL TIME.    I usually go here when I'm trying to watch what I eat, which is always, but that's neither here nor there. They always accommodate my absurd requests: Sashimi Dinner, No rice, Double salad, Dressing on the side. I hate myself for that order, but they don't judge, and that makes me happy. The sashimi is amazing. Another reviewer commented on the sushi being cut poorly (jagged edges). I'm no Sushi master, but I did pass first grade, can color in the lines, and cut out shapes. I never noticed these jagged edges, AND I'M A REGULAR (literally considering mercury poisoning just to be the duchess of this place.) One more comment, and then I'll move on, who cares if the edges aren't perfect - the taste is amaze, and that's what really matters, I think.  So things I swear by: Sashimi dinner, obviously. The mushroom special from the specials board... cooked with.... what's it called.. dang it, well they're amazing, and the sauce is amazing. PONZU? I think. Big fan. My mom always orders the tempura, and it's delightful as well."}
{"text":"If you are interested in having the best sushi in valley.  This Japanese owned and operated restaurant is for you.      My mother in law lives in Japan comes back to visit once a year and she always insists on coming to Hiro, because she remembers it as being most similar to sushi in Japan.     In Japan, my inlaws don't actually order food.  They simply let the Sushi chef choose what he feels like feeding us.  If you operate under this principle at Hiro Sushi, prices will augment."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I've been to in Arizona, although not comparable to little Tokyo and some other place in LA area. Their Volcano roll (in appetizer) is a must try."}
{"text":"Hiro was great. We got the Hiro roll, the yellowtail jalapeno sashimi, caterpillar roll, and blue fin. Mussel were good but not my favorite."}
{"text":"Son runs terrible business got take out. Went back in to tell them three rolls were missing. Waited forever then they tell me they gave all. One was their $15 diamondback roll. The father would not run the business like this. Great food but do not get takeout. Oh and the teenage HOS test probably did not help the ordering. Hope this turns around or their legacy is going down hill fast."}
{"text":"This week, our sushi quest brought us to Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale.  After last week's debacle, we wanted something that seemed like a more sure bet.  We started with the miso soup, and then ordered pretty much everything that seemed new and/or tasty.  The first dish that was served was our sashimi, which included uni (not the best I've had, but I'm spoiled after having had live sea urchin), toro (this was delicious), and Spanish mackerel (with deep fried bones!).  I am a mackerel fan, and the bones were even better.  I thought about asking if they had any extra Spanish mackerel bones lying around.  Next, we had the ankimo, which was pretty good.  I've had better ankimo, but it was far superior to the ankimo we had at Hana Japanese Eatery over a month ago.  After the ankimo, they brought the dynamite appetizer.  This was a baked scallop, mushroom, and cream dish that was pretty delicious, and a definite hit at our table (though it was inferior to the dynamite I had over a week earlier, which had geoduck in addition to scallops).  We then had the sushi: sea snail, edge of halibut, escolar, and jellyfish.  The halibut was garnished with too much wasabi for my taste, the sea snail was lightly flavored and crunchy, and the escolar was amazing.  (One of my friends pointed out this morning that escolar can cause diarrhea that is orange and oily, and I said, \"So, basically like my diarrhea this morning.\"  I contend that it was worth it.)  The jellyfish was a first for me; it was crunchy with a bit of a spicy flavor (not sure if they seasoned it, or if this is naturally the way jellyfish tastes).  At this point, we decided that we wanted a little more, so we ordered grilled shishitou peppers and salmon roe.  The salmon roe was not the best I have had, but the peppers were pretty tasty (not as good as the ones they have at Roka Akor, however).  Out of curiosity, I asked the waitress if they had any kama, which I did not see on the menu.  She said they had hamachi and salmon kama, which was only $8, so we sprung for the hamachi.  It was tasty and tender, but not as fall-off-the-bone tender or mouth-wateringly delicious as the hamachi kama we had at Sushi on Shea.  Finally, we had the tempura ice cream, which was the best tempura ice cream I have found in Phoenix.  Overall, Hiro seems like a very good sushi bar.  The food is fresh, they have some good special items, and it is actually very reasonably priced.  Unfortunately, it will be hard to go back here with Sushi on Shea being only a few miles down the road."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend here one day several months ago and I was very impressed with their daily special including hand rolls.  I will definitely be going back there."}
{"text":"This place is ah-mazing.  It's a family-owned business and they came from LA to Arizona to setup shop.    The sushi is so yummy.  We had Toro and a rainbow roll.  The quality of fish is excellent.  I also had the udon noodle soup which I split with my mom.  It was the perfect accompaniment to a chilly winter day.  You can split it easily, and they bring you the bowls and spoons to do so.  It even has a soft boiled egg in it! Yummy  The menu has more than standard rolls, there are a lot of fusion rolls to choose from!  They also had hot green tea that was so good.  This place is intimate and welcoming, definitely worth becoming a regular at!"}
{"text":"tryout this place last night since many yelpers gave it a 5 stars.  unfortunately, this place is no 5 stars to me.  portion was small (the mirugai on the sushi is about 1\" by 2/3\" on top of the rice ball) & the rice was on the dry side.  ordered 12 pieces of sushi, 1 roll, & an order of sashimi (4 thin pieces).....$115 total for 2 adults & a kid (tax & tips included).  not going back.....:("}
{"text":"Looking for a smaller legit place for good sushi? This is your place.   It's small, not glam and quiet. Thank God :)  We finally have found our neighborhood sushi joint. :)"}
{"text":"First sushi place I tried in Scottsdale with my gf.  To be honest I was nervous about the whole sushi in the desert situation.  Luckily I eventually found a few better places but the price and taste combo made Hiro sushi 2 stars easy."}
{"text":"I am ALWAYS on the lookout for fresh authentic sushi and Hiro is it! I enjoy coming her for lunch. They have a great sashimi lunch deal that includes a salad, rice and miso soup. The chefs are mostly from Japan and are friendly to speak with. They always have something new and unusual like snapper carpaccio. My only let down was the rolls. I am thinking this is because they are best at traditional sushi, nigiri and sashimi. It is still worth a try. Just get there early because they will be busy but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner with 2 co-workers last night, a Monday night.  We walked in and found out it was our lucky night.  Without a reservation we weren't able to get a table, but there were 3 seats in a row immediately available at the sushi bar.  This place is small, so definitely plan ahead and make reservations.  The service was friendly and prompt. We started with edamame, seaweed salad and a house salad.  Our group of 3 ordered a variety of sushi rolls, nigiri and sashimi.    I tend to stick with rolls primarily, but couldn't resist the tuna (maguro) nigiri my boss ordered.  The fish is so fresh here, I had to try a piece.  He also had the Negi Toro roll (fatty tuna/tuna belly with scallions) which I tried.  It wasn't my personal favorite, but I'm glad I tried it here at Hiro to try the best.  I chose 2 rolls for myself. First, a shrimp tempura roll.  Pretty reliable and not very creative, but I always get it.  This one was a little bland (probably made worse by my no-cucumber request) but they happliy provided a little side of eel sauce when I requested it.  My second roll was the Spicy Ribbon Roll.  I LOVED it.  I will go back for this roll.  The spicy tuna had a great flavor and was a perfect match for the cool, creamy avocado striped on top.  This was by far the highest quality sushi I have had in Phoenix/Scottsdale, and probably anywhere else in the country.  The price was fair and as I expected.  Rolls range from $6.95 to $13.95.  No real specials like happy hour, but I was coming here for an exceptional dinner, not a discounted price and/or experience."}
{"text":"Hiro Sushi is the best Japanese restaurant in Arizona. It's everything you ever want in a sushi restaurant. It is authentic Japanese, prices are reasonable, and the fish is fresh. Forget about all the other fancy, trendy, expensive sushi restaurants in the valley. This is where it's at.  I've had the spicy salmon roll, spicy yellowtail, las vegas and a salmon skin hand roll. The rice is cooked perfectly and as previously mentioned, the fish is always fresh. My boyfriend always orders the chef's choice (Omakase I believe?). For appetizers, I always order the seaweed salad and squid salad. Their calamari is honestly my favorite calamari ever. It is cut into tiny pieces and breaded, and comes in a bowl with green onions and ponzu sauce. Absolutely delicious. You can't go wrong with the hamachi kama as well as one of their potato string wrapped shrimp appetizers.   All of my foodie friends and I always rave about how amazing Hiro Sushi is. If you are a sushi snob like myself, there is absolutely no doubt that Hiro would be your favorite as well."}
{"text":"Since I've relocated from Los Angeles, finding good sushi places has been a task. I took it upon my fellow yelpers to find this place and I was happy that I did. I was planning on going to Ra or Stingray, though I knew it would be mediocre, before finding this place on Yelp.  So we get there day after Christmas with no reservation at around 6:20pm. Why would we need one it shouldn't be that busy, right?  Wow we were wrong. The wait was going to be 50-1 hr for 2 and it was only for the sushi bar. So we decided to wait. (I needed my sushi fix) There was no place to really wait except for outside. There was no bar, the restaurant was small so we couldn't wait inside, and placed in a strip mall with nothing much around.  We walked to a small Mexican cafe located in the same area for some drinks while we waited. (back in 40 mins since there was no other methods of letting us know that our table was ready)  Finally we get seated at the sushi bar. We ordered several pieces of nigiri (toro, sweet raw shrimp with fried shrimp head, scallop, uni, hokkigai) and one maki of spicy yellow tail. That was delicious. Maybe it was because I haven't had sushi in such a long time but everything that I had was pretty tasty. The only thing that I could done without was the salmon collar. It was greasy and had a little gelatinous taste for me on some parts but my husband enjoyed it so that's all that matters.  The severs were great and attentive. Place was cozy and had a warm feel to it and prices weren't too bad. 4 stars for the wait and the so so salmon collar.   I will be back most definitely and maybe it will be 5 stars."}
{"text":"I went to this sushi joint twice. The service is average and both time during lunch. The second time , I ordered omekaze at later part of lunch period. I waited about half hour and the whole ordered came in one plate . First of all, I am used to sushi serve by the chef one at time for omekaze . The other things were missing all the basics , no ginger or wasabi and some of the garnishes for certain pieces that the head chef ( I think was Mr. Hiro himself ) had to put on the pieces . It was quite disappointing for pricey sushi set menu at $110 . The quality was little better than average . I noticed most the clientele at Hiro ordered rolls and not nigiri. So, if you are looking for sushi , look at other as Shinbay"}
{"text":"There is a great scene in the movie High Fidelity where John Cusack's character, Rob Gordon is \"dying a long slow death\" at a dinner party full of pretentious, nouveau riche snobs, including the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones. Rob thinks to himself..... \"Of course there's envy: why isn't my life like this? Sure I want their money and clothes and jobs and opinions. And I'd like to have advice on jet lag, but that's not it. I mean they're not bad people and I'm not a class warrior, it's something else.\"   If I were to sit here and attempt to write an educated, articulate and accurate appraisal of how good Hiro's sushi is than I would be just like one of those snobs Rob so despised.  I wish I could tell you how I could taste the freshness of Hiro's tuna, or how the mackerel was served at just the right temperature, but I need to recognize my culinary limitations. I have never lived near the ocean. I have never been to Japan, and until about two years ago all I ever knew of sushi were the ubiquitous \"rolls\" that we have come to know all too well.   Lately however I have been ordering more sashimi and nigiri trying to learn the nuanced flavors of the fish, rice and combination of the two. I will try to stop dunking everything in soy sauce and wasabi, and whenever possible I will order omakase and let the chef take over.   For the time being I believe that Hiro is a really good place to continue my sushi education. My first visit went well. The restaurant itself certainly passes the eyeball test. Hiro appears to be very authentic. The service was friendly and fast, and the fish portions were very generous. And yes, everything I had tasted wonderful, I just don't yet have the expertise to be able to honestly explain exactly why it was better than other sushi joints around town."}
{"text":"Pretty impressive sushi for being in the middle of the desert. I ordered the kalamari (zesty , tangy and fresh) and the diamondback roll which was to die for. Delicious!! Thanks , yelp ."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for at least a decade, and finally made the drive to try it. Damn, that was the best sushi I have ever had. Yeah, it's a little pricy but that's because you truly get what you pay for. The fish was so fresh and tasty and all the employees were super sweet and attentive. If you're jonesing for some amazingly delicious sushi, do your mouth, stomach, and emotional well-being a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"This IS as good as it gets for sushi in Arizona. Not only is the sushi superbly prepared but the selection of fish has to be the freshest I've tasted here in Arizona. It is one of those \"hole in the wall\" restaurants that everyone praises about but, it actually deserves the praise. One could easily order nothing but hand rolls and sashimi and be perfectly content, if you want to mix things up, I suggest the Dynamite Clams."}
{"text":"Hiro Sushi has a magical affect on me.  If you close your eyes and relax just a bit, it will transport you to a very special place. You see, Hiro Sushi reminds me so much of those old style Japanese sushi places from the past.    No, it doesn't have a conveyor belt.  Nor does it have any of those fancy, wiz bang modern features that you find in so many Valley sushi places. No huge caldrons of fire keeping watch over it's entrance. LOL  It fact Hiro's entrance is very unassuming. If you driven along 90th Street regularly, you probably past it many times, not realizing it was there.  The California Rolls are delicious, as are the tuna sushi. In fact everything is great. Five Stars. Expect to pay around $25-ish depending how thirsty and hungry you are.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So me and my boy decided to hit this spot up because I was here like 2 weeks ago and liked it. This place does not disappoint the Tuna here is FRESH and Delicious. This place was crowded on Friday at 7:30 we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated but it was well worth it. Once seated the food came out fast and was superb, I don't drink but my friend got a beer and said it was well priced. As of today this is my favorite Sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Took my 7yrs son who is a big sushi fan but never had Toro before.  Ordered a few nigiri, udon and Toro sashimi.  Great food and excellent service.  Sitting at the sushi counter is a nice treat for my son to watch his sushi being made.  Sushi and Sashimi are the highlights.  Udon has a nice broth.  Price is about $20-40 per person depending on what you ordered."}
{"text":"This is the sushi spot I've been searching for! Fresh fun and fantastic service. Sitting at the sushi bar is key for the experience. Chefs are knowledgeable and entertaining. This is my new sushi go to. Kid friendly."}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday night with my husband. We were told we have to wait about 30 minutes but were seated at the bar within 15. I was so excited to have some good quality, authentic sushi. Our waitress was nice, but definitely rushed. There wasn't a lot of talking let's just say LOL. But that was fine, I was there for the food! I had the chirashi which was so beautiful and tasty. The fish was fresh! I also had the smoked salmon nigiri which was the best I've ever had.... melts in your mouth deliciousness. My husband doesn't like sushi (lame I know) so he had an udon noodle bowl and vegetable tempura which were also good. We washed it all down with Kirin and hot sake. I will definitely return when I want good quality, authentic sushi!! The chefs appear to take great pride in their work, the presentation of the food is a piece of art and it was nice to see the owner there working hard as well :)"}
{"text":"Second time eating at the sushi bar and I still think it's the freshest sushi in Arizona. I'm from LA where there is a ton of fresh sushi and this place is surprisingly up to par. Got the omakase tonight and it was amazing!  Got uni sushi and most of the time when I order this it's not fresh and looks gross... Both visits I've ordered this and both times it has been fresh and tastes like the sweet ocean!  Sushi chefs are friendly and attentive. Waitresses are hit or miss. My first visit the waitress refilled my green tea constantly. This time I had to turn around and ask for it to be refilled. Oh well. I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"First visit tonight.  Was reassured when I saw how packed the place was. A little tucked away place with the most awesome sushi ever!  My family has decided they didn't want to go to any other sushi restaurant but this one. Sushi was fabulous!  My ears perked up when I heard the sushi chefs speaking to each other in Japanese!  I haven't heard that since my childhood in Japan!  Explains why the sushi was so good- it is authentic. Going back tomorrow per family's request!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food was good, prices are descent. Very busy little spot. We sat in front of the chef by the bar area, very interactive and fun. This is a great spot for a first date."}
{"text":"As the first restaurant I've ever visited in AZ, Hiro Sushi knocked it out of the park on the first swing. After a long, exhausting, and morally defeating week of 120-degree weather, I was in need for a real \"treat yo self\" evening. I strolled into Hiro elated to find an air-conditioned oasis with a lively sushi bar and (most important) cold sake.   I've dined solo at several points in my life; sometimes it's awkward, especially if you're given a table for two with a romantic view. Bellying up to the sushi bar took all of the awkwardness out of eating alone. With the friendly sushi chefs taking orders and providing a little bit of entertainment, I had a great time with my roll ($6), my udon ($13), and my unexpectedly huge bottle of Nigiri sake ($11).   Really friendly service and a full house of patrons (on a Thursday night in my case) made for fun, family-friendly vibes with great food. If I'm staying in the area again, I'll be sure to return!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best sushi in Scottsdale and it's quiet and the sushi chefs are fun and friendly. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese sushi place.  Coming from NYC, we have been missing a real Japanese sushi restaurant that doesn't over sauce or over complicate the dishes.  This place hit the spot.  Low key, fresh fish, delicious.  We sat at the sushi bar and had several sushi and sashimi dishes with sake.  So happy there is a great sushi place like this near by.  We look forward to discovering other great Japanese, Chinese, Thai and Korean restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My husband is Japanese and this is an authentic sushi place, the ambience and lighting its not so bright but it's private, I kind of like it actually... they don't have so many tables so I think this is part of the ambience, the service is very good as you can expect from the Japanese culture, i will totally recommend this place for a date! But make sure to have a reservation in advance.  Of course the food is fresh and tasty and they accommodate if you want something that isn't included on the menu."}
{"text":"The best sushi place I have found in the Valley!  Service was pretty good for a small place.  A lot of the dishes are spicier than you would normally find them elsewhere, which was great!  Prices were reasonable.  I will certainly be back to this delicious place!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have ever had. Consistently good, as fresh as it gets. I travel among the best city in the US for my job in the food business and I would never thought I'd be saying the following: The best sushi ever it's at Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale AZ! Good job Hiro!"}
{"text":"Consistently fresh, friendly and delicious! Authentic, true Japanese style. The best sushi in Scottsdale!! But, during high season, be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Just AMAZING.i love ppl who working there. the service is very Japanese style.and I really had good conversation with them they're owners sister and her husband.i came for only here from NM lol and It was worth  ????????????????????????!!??????????????????????????????????????????( ´?)"}
{"text":"I had a lunch combo, Sushi and Mixed Tempura deal. I think the food is not only fresh but also appealing to my Japanese taste buds. There were two Sushi chefs at Sushi counter, and they are both Japanese. I will definitely eat there again when I am in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Best of the best.  This is THE sushi place in all of Scottsdale and the surrounding cities in the Phoenix area.  Having lived in Japan, I have tasted the real good sushi and other traditional Japanese dishes like udon, tonkatsu.   The fish is always fresh, some flown in from Japan. On a regular night, Hiro and his sons are behind the counter, making sushi for the customers.  During the cooler months, I like to order the nabeyaki udon and some rolls like toro, caterpillar, rainbow, spicy tuna etc.  The nigiri and sashimi are amazing.  Sometimes, I like to order the bento selection with tempura and tonkatsu as my favorite choices.  The tempura here is just the way it should be, light and crunchy.  Seriously, Hiro Sushi is an oasis in the desert state of Arizona, can't get any better... Totemo oichi desu...  (very delicious)"}
{"text":"My husband is a sushi snob and has eaten at some of the best sushi restaurants on the states. So, he has a rather discerning palate when it comes to sashimi.   We found Hiro on Yelp and met up with some friends there for a night out. Immediately we knew we were on the doorsteps of sushi heaven (well, the sushi heaven in AZ) because of all the Japanese celebrity photos on the wall. If Japanese celebrities are eating here, it must be good.   It is was. We ordered a variety of items from the menu including sashimi, rolls, and even a cooked dish. Eat one provided a fabulous experience and left not a single crumb on a dish.  The atmosphere is unsophisticated and quaint, which I enjoy. It's sushi, man. Keep it real. Don't blast your trendy music and distract us with large fish tanks and clean lines.   The service was on par, the chefs top notch and we will  definitely go back time and again."}
{"text":"Let me say this, I usually hate sushi in Arizona. I love it in general but most places are down right disgusting, this place however is a right step in the direction, its what sushi should be. Unlike Ra and stingray, it's very intimate, the servers are knowledgable, the sushi chefs are experienced and by that I mean they have some age to them. I can't imagine an 18 year old making sushi really knows much about each fish in the trendy places. Loved the tuna belly sashimi and sedona roll!"}
{"text":"my favorite sushi place in phoenix. tiny place thats hard to find, but the best and most authentic sushi i've had in phoenix. good atmosphere with friendly chefs. descent prices too."}
{"text":"The most beautiful sushi I've eaten in Arizona. This place requires a reservation which I sometimes forget to make, but staff is always kind and seat us. I give it 5 stars for service and 5 stars for food."}
{"text":"Hiro Sushi is my favorite sushi place in Arizona, and I've tried a lot. The food is very authentic Japanese and basically everyone on their staff speaks Japanese. I wish they had brown rice options, but the food is so good I still have to give it 5 stars even without it."}
{"text":"Good sushi place... you will be able to find some unique cuts of tuna that you cant find at most sushi places... the prices are pretty good... you have to try the noodle bowl thing... i guess hiro (th owner)  is famous for this thing... the atmosphere is nothign special... it is in a strip mall with typical sushi decorations... but i would definatly go back if i was in the area..."}
{"text":"Sushi was decent but service was painfully slow on what didn't appear to be a particularly busy night. Hopefully will do better next time."}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best sushi place I've ever been to, till date! I've been here at least a dozen times, and this review is certainly long overdue. Everything on their sushi menu is amazing, and the quality of the food is truly top notch. The salmon sashimi simply melts in your mouth, and the Negi Torro (Tuna belly), yellowtail and Uni (Sea Urchin) sashimi/rolls are my other favorites. Yes it's a pricey place, but you gotta believe me when I say it's totally worth it. And the servers are the kindest, humblest and the most mild mannered people ever. Amazing experience every time!"}
{"text":"I found a favorite sushi restaurant in AZ!  Their sushi was fresh & the chefs were all Japanese!  One unique roll I had there was the Sukiyaki roll.  Since I was a somewhat regular they'd provide us with 3 types of wasabi which really made the sushi experience."}
{"text":"I had a really nice time at this restaurant and enjoyed my sushi, especially for the lower price. This place is smaller than its counterparts like RA, but the quality of the sushi is just as great.  The setting was very authentic, and the service was AMAZING. Everyone was incredibly friendly and polite.  I recommend the dynamite roll."}
{"text":"As good as it gets.  Went on Wednesday.  Apparently it's the best day for unique fresh fish selection.  Saw things on the sushi menu that I've never had before.  3 lined grunt, Red Sea bream, etc.  always order the eryngii mushroom which are fabulous.  The salmon skin roll is the best on earth.  I'm not super adventurous when it comes to sushi but their mainstays like toro, bluefin, yellowtail are solid.  Will return next Wednesday."}
{"text":"Hiro continues to please as it has for years. The fact that it is consistently packed on mid-week nights speaks to the quality and consistency of the sushi.  No bells and whistles, and still no flaming radish blooms, but Hiro has some of the best sushi around and has proven itself year after year."}
{"text":"For Arizona, I think this is one of the better options around. What makes this place decent is the quality of the sushi and the service. The sushi is not mind blowing amazing, but its not terrible either; perfect for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Hiro! My FAVORITE sushi joint in AZ!! The last sushi I had was about two weeks ago in Hawaii so coming back I haven't had the urge to get sushi thinking it just won't be the same. I have always loved this well kept secret and have continued to bring friends who are obsessed! Thank goodness for the X who showed me Hiro. I needed to find a place to get good sushi. I have come here for a few years n have never been disappointed. It's a small restaurant where the sushi chefs don't use gloves because they are so excellent with their knives and watch the handling of everything I trust that this place is not only authentic sushi but very clean. The staff are nice, they have good specials and the food is amazing!!! Please order a calamari for yourself as an appetizer (you won't regret it) :)"}
{"text":"Authentic sushi and atmosphere in Scottsdale. Found this place through Yelp. So glad we came here. We came at lunch, they open at 11:30, by 12pm the place was packed. Great service by friendly and knowledgeable servers. So fun watching the sushi chefs prepare our food. This place reminded me of the sushi places we've visited in Kyoto and Tokyo, took me back to great memories! Super fresh fish, not smelly and not fishy. We had the crazy roll, tuna sushi and bento box with gyoza and tempura. All were great. Tempura well done slightly greasy but yummy. Big servings. The spicy tuna in the Crazy Roll was amazing! They don't use mayo just fresh chopped tuna and spicy sauce. I appreciate that. The gyoza in the bento box was full of flavor, juicy meat and pan fried to perfect crispness! Definitely go here! The price is right, the food is on point and it will take you on a trip down memory lane in Japan!"}
{"text":"Hiro is probably the best place to get sushi in the Valley area. It is a small, yet high volume restaurant- so if you're going around the 7-8pm-ish times, be sure to make a reservation as sometimes we see groups waiting in the front for decent periods of time.   Their nigiri is really the best in Arizona. I've gone to plenty of sushi spots, and none can compare to the quality of Hiro's nigiri. They serve a great portion of fish with the perfect amount rice to go with it. Their fish is always fresh and always melts in your mouth. Recommendations: yellowtail, salmon, and albacore. I usually don't wander from my comfort zone when it comes to nigiri, but these never disappoint.   Now for the rolls. I know that true sushi really doesn't include rolls, but, hey. How could you go wrong? Their Las Vegas roll is AMAZING. Probably The best I've ever eaten. Crunch on the outside, and warm, smoked delicious salmon on the inside with gooey cream cheese! Yum!  Be sure to try the crazy roll as well! It comes in pink wrapping instead of the traditional green seaweed paper.  The rolls are also a decent size for what you pay for. One Las Vegas ($12.95) roll is enough to fill me for lunch on a regular day!  Their caterpillar rolls and rainbow rolls are also picks that I frequently see when dining there.   The service (and i mean waitresses) is pretty good. Not great, not bad, just good. All they do is pretty much bring you your rolls/nigiri/sashimi whatever and then leave. But nothing to complain about.  The sushi chefs are great though! If you have the opportunity to sit at the sushi bar- do so. Because you can always make conversation with the chefs who know just about everything about the menu and they are funny and polite. They also give the restaurant an authentic Japanese feel because they speak Japanese!   Other recommendations: the sweet and sour cucumber salad. Usually it comes right before the sushi and makes a delicious and light appetizer! (They also serve teriyaki chicken and things that are more kid friendly, but I have yet to try them!!)"}
{"text":"Great little place. All the sushi was good, but the flying fish roe was put together loose and the eggs spilled in my soy sauce :[ but they were still good. Very friendly sushi chefs."}
{"text":"OMG...this place it's amazingly good!  Every pieces of sashimi it's just melt in our mouth. This place is very cozy not fancy but the foods are out of this world.   Besides serving fresh fishes, the chef is very knowledgeable of his products, and the waitresses are outstanding.  Thank you for the delicious meal Hiro Sushi you really deserved the five stars from me! For dinner of two adults and one kid the meal come to $181.42 plus tips.  All of us were stuffed and happy!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi! I'm from San Fran, and usually skeptical about eating Sushi in AZ, but this place is the exception. My dad dragged me in and i ended up really enjoying myself. Great service and phenomenal tempura, deff get an order of that with your sushi (same with tempura rolls). Toro rolls and shrimp were both really tasty.Also it looks like they keep the place really clean which is comforting. Definitely will be my sushi spot from now on living in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the Valley hands down.  Everything was fresh, and if you have the pleasure to have Masa as your chef he knows what he's doing.  Uni with quail egg, toro, maguro, oysters, hamachi, spicy tuna roll, unagi, fresh water eel.   If you want to get in the mood, turn on Netflix, watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi, and then go and eat here.  BE PREPARED TO PAY!  Good sushi is never cheap, but for what you get, I'll gladly pay the price to have a seat at this bar."}
{"text":"delicious.  4.5 stars but I round up since no half stars.   This is our second time visiting Hiro's. The sushi was very good both times and it tastes fresh.  There is a difference in fresh sushi that you can taste.  Now if you think places like RA serves fresh sushi then you don't have a clue,  just trust me.    The prices are decent to a little high compared to other joints but remember you pay for what you get.  I would recommend this place for date.  Sit at the bar if you can.   You may want to make reservation to make sure you have a seat.  We got seated right away but as we were sitting we noticed how a bunch of people kept coming in and people were constantly waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Amazing as always. My wife and I come get about 3 times a month. Seriously the best sushi in Scottdale.   Tonight we had the amber jack, halibit, salmon, and mackerel sashimi. Airways sport fresh and very very clean.   We also had the veg tempura and the eggplant appetizer. All the best in Scottsdale.   If you have not tried Hiro, I beg you to give it a try if you like wonderful sushi."}
{"text":"I was told this was the best in Scottsdale, I can't confirm but I can say it was excellent!    We were seated at the sushi bar.  The deep fried rolls were not my favorite (I prefer more traditional fresh rolls) but my fiancé loved them.    The salmon was extremely fresh, and the cucumber salad was wonderful.  Loved the jazz roll and Houston roll.  Service was 100%, staff was friendly and attentive.   When you walk in, it's a tiny little restaurant with limited seating and a half hour wait , that's how we knew we hit the jackpot.    Worth the wait!!!!"}
{"text":"Brought 5 homesick, cafeteria overloaded students here last night and it was fabulous. We had at least 12 rolls including the spider, caterpillar, and sedona, and the sushi was fresh, delicious, and beautifully presented. We also ordered off the menu, and my udon was great. The broth was flavorful and delicate, noodles not overcooked at all. The sushi chef was really quick banging out our orders (I guess we looked hungry!) and I was just very impressed how neatly it was presented AND good too. I guess I have been to too many sloppy sushi restaurants and am a little fed up with so-so efforts. I know that this will become one of our go-to spots whenever we come to Tempe/Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is a legit Japanese restaurant.  I was skeptically being in AZ that I would find one.  I walked in and spoke to the chefs right away in Japanese and they spoke right back to me in the same language.  My first test.  Then order some basic nigiri sushi.  It was very good.  The fish was fresh and the selection was fantastic.  The sushi rice was very good also which is the key to good sushi - (my dad is a sushi chef).  I would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for an authentic Japanese restaurant that also American inspired \"rolls\"."}
{"text":"So I walk into the resturant gluten free soy sauce in tow. (mmmhmm San J, what will I do without you?!?!) We are all instantly greeted with foreign japanese by the many sushi chefs banked across the side at the bar.  We smile and I realize this is as authentic as it gets! (there is a page in the menu that is completely japanese!) My family and I have tried this place before, but we couldn't get in it was so packed and for a Thursday night there was a great showing.   My mother and I end up splitting a couple of rolls and some nigiri and I had some sunamono-it's always my vice. I liked every roll that we ordered, even the philly roll, my mother has a thing for cream cheese. (really not my thing) All the fish was fresh and tasty! My brother and my father ordered miso soup and both decreed that they gave it their approval- we are very picky with out miso! The servers were extremely attentive and brought us whatever we needed.   I felt that this was a great place being the only non asian family dining here. I really like a place that doesn't throw out \"HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS\" (ending up being old fish) and \"artificial krab\" (yucckk!) I will gladly spend a little more for fresh real fish and a nice authentic atmosphere without all the fried fake americanized sushi. (fried krab covered with globs of sugary sauce is NOT sushi whatever anyone says)  It's bittersweet that I have finally found a delicious sushi place that I can always go to for a fantastic meal when I am moving out of the state for college next week. Oh well, it will become a delectable treat whenever I come home or if I get really pathetic and need my real sushi fix maybe my mom will ship me some? hint hint :) just kidding.  Fabulous place I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place I've eaten at in the area. I've had Kabuki, Sakana, and Raw and this is by far the most authentic and least \"Americanized\" sushi place. They even have soba noodles and the appetizers are great (the sauce tastes authentic too). I had the agedashi tofu, fried oyster, mixed tempura, spider roll, and eel&cucumber roll, which were all very good and very filling. I got my order to go and they were really nice about it, packing it so that it didn't lose its taste. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and service! Big selection, lots of specials. Neighborhood sushi restaurant that is better than many others in Scottsdale. Only drawback is that it's small & gets crowded easily."}
{"text":"Totally solid. Really. Reason it's not five stars... is the price! IMHO, there are other sushi bars in the PHX area, that are just as fresh and tasty, and not as $$$$ I ended up spending $75 on food and drink, including tax and tip. While it was tasty, it wasn't that tasty.  I can find better for $30."}
{"text":"I've found my favorite sushi place in Arizona! The restaurant is small, but it doesn't lack character. I got an avocado roll and sweet potato tempura roll, both of which were on a secret menu. I was blown away by how fresh the avocado was. The rice was the perfect consistency and flavor as well. The tempura was to die for. I was sad to finish eating it. My boyfriend loved his sushi as well (he got blue fin negi toro and the spicy yellow tail), which he described as \"very rich and savory\". Needless to say, we will be coming back! I'm so happy to find a place out here in the desert that can meet my vegan sushi needs."}
{"text":"will go back - good sushi - fresh fish!!  Good Sushi !!  - reasonably priced - good lunch spot - they are were packed service was off by 10% (not bad)"}
{"text":"From the outside it looks typical Scottsdale strip mall.  But open that door and you will be instantly transported to an awesome Izakaya style restaurant you'd likely find tucked away on one of Tokyo's busy side streets.  While they do have menu items that cater to our Western tastes the experience is far more enriching than what you'd get at average sushi joint.  A specific tip of the hat to their Chirashi."}
{"text":"It is deff a small hole in the wall place but excellent service, food and quick! My mom works at the barber/hair salon at the end of the row and I prefer Hiro to Ajo Al's any day of the week. If I take my mom to lunch it will be here. I have also been in with my kid and they don't seem to mind the mess she makes with the rice and Ikura =) thankfully she is older now O:-) They have great stuff like Toro oh yummmmm not too many places have it!! Thank you seafood sushi god's!!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places we've been. Service was great, fresh fish and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Best japanese place in Scottsdale. Great fish, wonderful staff and good traditional japanese food! My family and I go here all the time:)"}
{"text":"It's was okay. I'd like to give it 2.5 stars. I always order the sushi dinner the first time I go to a sushi restaurant, gives me a feel for the sushi chef and the balance of a complete meal. The dressing in the salad was the best thing we ate all night, it would have been better on cucumbers with sesame seeds instead of iceberg. The miso soup needed salt and the tofu was bland and too big. The fish wasn't the freshest, the surf clam was really hard to eat. The nigiri had no wasabi in it and the wasabi that came on the plate was not fresh made and was very mild. And my favorite mackerel was bitter which made me sad. The atmosphere was good, the service was wonderful.  I think I was expecting so much more because of all the incredible reviews and I was not impressed."}
{"text":"I was never very adventurous when it came to food. Even when I was a high school student studying Japanese, I was always too afraid to even try sushi. Thank goodness a woman with a more sophisticated palate than my own came along to show me the error of my ways!  Tucked away in a little shopping center off of 90th in Scottsdale, Hiro is another one of the many great places around town that you'd miss if you weren't actually looking for it...so pay attention!  Hiro Sushi is only open for lunch and dinner. I know...of course it's not open for breakfast...but between lunch and dinner the restaurant actually closes down. So, be sure and pay attention to the hours of operation, as you might miss your opportunity to enjoy awesome place!  Having been to a few different sushi places to date, I would have to say that that Hiro is my favorite. At some places, they have a conveyor belt that brings different dishes around for you to enjoy. Although I do enjoy those places as well, Hiro has a more traditional Japanese feel to it. It's more authentic than gimmicky.   Since we were with our daughter, we ended up sitting at a table. While we were waiting for our food, I noticed that there was a sushi bar where you could sit and see all of the different foods. I also noticed that the sushi chefs were very chatty and involved with the patrons seated in front of them. Next time, I think we'll find a sitter for a little while...THAT would be the full Japanese experience.  The menu itself is pretty extensive. They have \"Fill-in-the-Blank\" Rolls of all different types. So, if you're a veteran to the different styles of sushi or if you're a rookie who is looking to safely expand their horizons a little bit, the menu will undoubtedly have something you'll enjoy.  The location itself is actually kind of small inside. The tables are pretty close together, so if you happen to be there while other people are eating, it's almost as if you were having lunch/dinner with them. That's the only negative thing I could find about this place, because the food and the service were awesome!"}
{"text":"I saw all the 5-star ratings so decided to check this place out.  I had a non-sushi combo dinner.  Teriaki chicken and fried oysters were the main courses.  The chicken was dry and the teriaki sause was sparingly added and not tasty.  My wife had several nigiri sushi selections and we found those to be very good.  We have been regular sushi eaters for over 20 years and came from the San Francisco Bay Area 2 years ago so we know good Japanese food when we see it.  This food is slightly over-priced.  The service was very good.  The wait for the food was a little longer than I would have liked.  This place is average and probably not worth waiting 30 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"This is the best Sushi I ever had in Phoenix. They have very fresh fish. If you like Sashimi , you would love this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi for dine in or take out! Staff is courteous and helpful, food is fresh. Best sushi I've had in Scottsdale!  The restaurant is dark from the outside, when we first approached my party couldn't tell if Hiro was open or not. Once inside though, we were happily greeted by framed awards and pictures of baseball players (go Giants!) eating there.  A new favorite :)"}
{"text":"Last min drop in, we were seated at the bar after a very short wait even though they were packed. The food was delicious and fast."}
{"text":"Definitely a cool place to hang with great food. After reading the yelp reviews, my husband and I made the trek to this establishment. I must say, we were not disappointed with anything. Fast, clean, friendly, fresh service and food.   I give it a four only because the sushi menu was very small and limited. However, the portions and items we chose were mouth watering delicious.   I love sushi and there isnt much I havent tried. The customers next to us had a lot of questions and I helped recommend a few items to them, which they loved.   I decided to finally try mochi and had the green tea and mango flavors. It literally made me smile and giggle it was so good. I know we will be back!!!   I suggest sushi lovers and newbies check it out. I also suggest you order the butterfish. The presentation is a lot fun."}
{"text":"So good !   Chirashi bowl is fresh and vibrant.  Nice fun atmosphere.   Sort of a strip mall feel outside but pleasantly surprised"}
{"text":"Showed up on a Sunday evening around 5:45pm to have dinner. Needed a table for 4 and was told they wouldn't be able to accommodate us because they were booked with reservations for the night. (I had called 15 mins before to make sure they were open that evening before we drove over and was not told we needed a reservation). Decided to just order food to go because we had 2 hungry kids with us that needed to have dinner. On the way out after our food was ready, a group of 5 showed up, said they had no reservations, and were seated immediately. Apparently, this restaurant discriminates against guests with children. So, beware that if you show up with kids, you might be denied seating. Very sad and upsetting."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special here and Okinawan Soba.  The spicy tuna and salmon hand rolls were very good.  The taste just takes you to another world.  The salmon skin hand rolls smelled fishy and tasted fishy on a few bites but then again, this is my first time eating salmon skin so I have no reference point.  Don't care to eat it again.  The lunch special came with miso soup and ginger salad, all of which were ordinary.  The waitress was not personable but helpful.  The sushi chefs were very nice and friendly.  The soba was very mediocre.  I'm used to going to Udon Soup Houses in New York City's Chinatown where they only make that so the soba here tastes like McDonald's version of soba.  I'm sure for Phoenix area, it is decent.  lol.  Won't be eating that again.  Once you eat at a Udon restaurant where they make the Udon fresh in front of your face, you can no longer this type of soup.    Overall I gave it 4 stars because the sushi was very good.  However this is Arizona after all so don't expect too much for other types of food.  lol."}
{"text":"Hiro's is a real find - an unpretentious restaurant with an intimate feel and really good sushi.  It's also surprisingly inexpensive (though sushi costs can add up fast).  There is often a substantial wait - I had a 15-minute wait at 8:30 on a weeknight, attesting to it's popularity with those in-the-know.  They have several sushi chefs working simultaneously, and the nigiri and maki start arriving quickly.  My favorite was the unagi, with the maguro and some of the specialty rolls not far behind.  In addition to maki, nigiri and sashimi, the also have other Japanese food available, such as tempura.    This is a real sushi place of the quality you'd find in San Francisco or Seattle, though they make the concession to the local market of calling things by their English names (i.e. Tuna rather than maguro).  The restaurant is a small business (family run?), and it shows - the staff know each other well and have been working together for a long time.    It's a great little place, and I recommend it."}
{"text":"I am sure this is a local favorite and I try to find fun places to go while traveling. This one was a miss. Not a repeat. Tried the crazy roll and the caterpillar roll. The crazy roll had lots of rice and very dry. The caterpillar role was cute but just didn't taste good. Sorry for the poor review."}
{"text":"ordered: - chirashi bowl [$17.95]  pros: - miso soup had some great tofu in it - not a fan of salmon, but it was some of the best ive ever had - nice thick cuts of fish, lots of rice - hearing japanese being spoken by the staff was reassuring  cons: - tamago looked kinda old - pricey, but worth - wish it came with a liiiiiitttttle bit of uni  tldr: - great fish in a relaxed environment - the only people giving this place bad reviews are the type that order california rolls and deep fried cream cheese filled bs"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and trying this out of other Yelp recommendations. Delicious and fresh! Would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"read alot of good reviews. the place is pretty small but there was seating at the sushi bar so we were seated right away. the staff was very friendly and attentive from start to finish.   we shared a sashimi platter (3 tuna, 2 salmon, 2 clams, 2 of something else). it came with a miso soup and an iceberg salad. we also ordered a spicy octopus salad. the octopus was more chewy than i'm use to. the sashimi was all very delicious, fresh tasting, and cut very well. we were pleased with our meal, but it wasn't anything i'd go out of my for. we have a favorite spot closer to our house. but if you're in this area, Hiro Sushi is good."}
{"text":"Oh my god the best sushi I've ever had!! So fresh and it's authentic Japanese sushi made by Japanese people not Korean!!! Try their mirugai and fried oysters to die for. I've been to many sushi spot all over US and it's by far the best I've ever had!! I'll give them 20 stars if I can.  I drive like 30 minutes plus to just eat their sushi. It's kinda far but definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Husband and I went here on mother's day. Super fresh fish, delicious rolls. Ate the deep fried soft shell crab as well. Tasty! About 1/2 way through our meal, Steven Seagal sat down with an entourage. Our server was also theirs, and still the service was good. We were greeted by the sushi chefs, and saw that they were talking and joking with each other and the patrons. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My coworker and I hit Hiro's for lunch the other day, and I'm so glad I did!   First off, this place isn't what I'd call inexpensive. Be prepared to drop at least $15, just for lunch. But it's worth it!  The vibe is very much like a legit sushi house in the middle of Tokyo, with everyone behind the counter and the main server being Japanese. It's definitely up there in terms of authenticity.  I have to admit, my initial impression was a little eehhhh... As soon as I walked in the door I was hit with a smell that was reminiscent of a fresh fish market. It threw me off, and I was a little worried about the quality of the fish because of it.   I needn't have worried.  The smell abated as soon as I stepped into the restaurant proper, and the seafood was ridiculously fresh. In fact, as we sat at the sushi bar we were able to watch one of the chefs butcher a yellow tail, and I don't think I've seen a fresher fish in Arizona.  As for the food, it was excellent! I got a spicy yellow tail roll and a Sesame roll, which is essentially a spider roll with a sesame soy wrapper instead of nori. The yellow tail was fresh and refreshing, with big chunks of avocado (I subbed it for the cucumber). The sesame roll was flavourful, with a ridiculous amount of soft shell crab.   My coworker got the chicken teriaki don and a roll... I don't remember which one. But the portion for the don was more than ample for lunch. Both items were so good, she cleaned both plates.   The service is excellent!  I'll definitely be back to try more of their rolls and their unagi don."}
{"text":"My husband and I are sushi fanatics and have been looking for our new 'spot'. He wanted to take me out for my birthday dinner, so we decided to try something new. HIro got great reviews (thanks as always Yelpers), so we went there. At first we were a bit put off by the strip mall setting, but we walked in to a full restaurant and very friendly staff. Everything from start to finish was fantastic. We ordered the seaweed salad which was labeled on the menu as \"best seaweed salad in Arizona\"... I'd have to agree. We then proceeded to order the real crab meat california roll, caterpillar, dragon, and crazy roll. All were delicious. And to top it all off, our waitress (who delivered top-notch service) brought an orange carved like Hello Kitty (very well done) for my birthday dessert. Hiro Sushi does a wonderful job and I can safely say we have found our new sushi spot."}
{"text":"Would have given it 3.5 stars if that was an option.  Not average, but not great either.  The portions were slightly above average.  The edamame (sp?) was very good, the service was excellent.  The sushi was good.  Definitely not the best we've had in town, probably not even in the top 10, but in the top 20.  There are at least 7 closer to our house with better sushi, so it is doubtful we would go back, unless we were in the neighborhood, and then the food was good enough to return."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time per recommendation to go. The atmosphere was cool!  The sushi tasted great! My only negative comment was that my friend had an upset stomach later that night and I woke up the next morning with a terrible upset stomach :-("}
{"text":"Paid a visit after a long research of reviews trying to find the best sushi place in Phoenix. Everything on the sashimi platter is very fresh. You really are getting what you are paying for."}
{"text":"A great sushi spot. The sushi was super fresh and this place is definitely one of the better sushi places I've been too.  Staff is very friendly and our sushi chef prepared everything excellently."}
{"text":"Get here early or make a reservation. Smaller space, but not with tables close together. The best Tuna Sashimi in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh sushi served here.  You won't be dissapointed! Tasty potstickers. Large selection of rolls...many that I tried were good!! The service was very attentive. I'll defiantly be returning soon!"}
{"text":"If you are a sushi lover, this place will make you happy especially because it caters to both the purists as well as to the wannabes. And I don't mean to use the term wannabe in a derogatory manner. I just wanted to convey that if you like your fish fried they will be able to satisfy your needs. And this is not just tempura. They have fried versions of many non-fried originals.  The menu is quite elaborate and they always feature numerous specials. This evening after being \"stood up\" for dinner by my son, Omar, who is a mere 6 hours behind schedule driving from LA to Scottsdale, I decided I was going to do sashimi. So I headed straight for Hiro, a place I have always been pleased with.  This evening was no different. I ordered a combination of mackerel, tuna and clam. Mon Dieu! It was heaven. What really accentuated the experience was that, if available, I always ask for freshly grated wasabi. Today I had the pickled wasabi and it was superb.  So I am a happy camper although I would have much preferred to have Omar eating alongside me."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in all of Arizona.  I have also taken out-of-town visitors and all have been delighted. The food is excellent, the service is great and the place is very cozy and relaxed."}
{"text":"Expensive! 3 rolls and 2 nigiri for $45 is pretty steep. I do have to admit, it was very good though! I placed my order to go and they included plenty of soy sauce, ginger and wasabi."}
{"text":"What a great place this is. I've recently become obsessed with sushi. I used to hate it, now I crave it on a daily basis. I want to eat everything with chopsticks... pizza... hotdogs... soup. whatever.   I was really in the mood for something spicy and I'm totally over the chain \"Japanese/sushi\" establishments, i really wanted something authentic. Yelp to the rescue!   It was a Friday night at about 8:30 and they were packed, I take that as a good sign. If the food is that good, I don't mind waiting. I was able to use my time to read the menu and decide on my meal.   My seat at the sushi bar was great. The chefs are so animated and alive. They all talk to each other in a funky mix of Japanese and English while they make your meal.   I started with the potstickers and they were delicious. Flavorful and hot and the perfect moistness, tenderness and crispy bottom. Perfect! Loved the scallion soy dipping sauce.  Then i had the Crazy Roll. This is shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, avocado and cucumber. Huge and fresh and great. Could definitely have been way spicier for me, but I guess that's what wasabi is for.   I would definitely come back and try everything else!   One glass of wine, one appetizer and one roll = about $25 with tip. Not bad!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Scottsdale. It has been my favorite for more 10 years.  As long as I've been coming here, they have been maintaining their level of food. I am always pleased after my visit.  If fact, I don't think I ever left this restaurant unhappy.  I took people from Japan, California, and you know those who thinks they can't get good sushi in the desert. All the people I took, they were pleased with the qualify of food.  For lunch, my favorite is chirashi. If you want, ask for deluxe chirashi (not on a menu).  They will make the best chirashi you ever had by using the best ingredients they have.  For dinner, I like to order food in Japanese izakaya (tapas) style. We start with different appetizers (including sashimi platter) to share with the group, then order sushi to finish. My favorite appetizer (again not on the menu) is kiwi salmon.  I like everything on the menu but sometimes like to ask them to make something other than what's on the menu.  Don't forget to look for daily special menu on the wall too.  I highly recommend to make reservation for dinner as they get busy even during the week."}
{"text":"Took my daughter there for her birthday.    After reading the reviews, I decided it wise to make reservations.   A wise move on my part.   Even though it was in the middle of the week, the place was packed and people waiting.   I was a bit leery of going there because I assumed (wrongly!) that it would have a lot of the Americanized sushi with all the surprise elements mixed in the makisushi, which I dislike.   If I am going to have nigiri sushi, I want a bite size piece of rice with whatever fish or product I pick put on top.  I ordered the sushi dinner and my daughter ordered sushi ala carte from the sushi menu.   The fish was fresh, definitely.   I can't say any more than that.   I LOVED it!    Presentation is, of course, outstanding, as one would expect.   Ambiance is almost what I've seen in Japanese restaurants in California.    The service was attentive, friendly, and impeccable.  Darn right I would return.   You betcha.."}
{"text":"My suggestion, come here for dinner as opposed to lunch. I've been here for both within a two week span and have had a good experience with both but I felt service was a bit quicker even if getting a table might be hard to accomplish.  The atmosphere is more calm even when busy, the food and wait service can be slow due to the high volume of people but the place was packed both times I came so I expected things like that. The food? In comparison with the other 3 places I've been to for sushi here in phoenix it was immaculate. It reminded me enough of Cali for the quality of fish I came back again the next day because I knew I would be leaving soon there after.  The flavor profiles for the food were good, the tempura whether as a side dish or within the rolls was crisp, the salmon was excellent, the quantity to quality ratio was good, aside from having to wait for a check each time for a considerable amount I was quite happy with the results.  So far I've had the negi toro, spicy ribbon, and I believe it was the phoenix or whatever the mixed fish roll was that had multiple types of fish in it that was deep fried. There was also one other roll but the name of it escapes me at this time. The negi toro and spicy ribbon were good, the phoenix not exactly my cup of tea.  All in all, in comparison with the other places I've been here, this place is a jewel. I'll gladly wait to get what I want out of food. If you're in a crunch for time, you shouldn't be going to places you know will be stacked with people anyway. That's just idiotic."}
{"text":"Fabulous Sushi in Arizona... Yes!  You heard it correctly!  Try it out for yourself and they take reservation for the tables, but at the sushi bar you'll have to wait... We waited 40 minutes, but it was worth the time!   Leo was our chef and was on the TOP of his game!!!!   Can't wait to go back the next time we are in Scottsdale!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a disappointment , ordered California roll and was really mediocre not as fresh as it should have been , ordered other rolls with friend , will not be back, Pure is Much better!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we caught them on a bad night or what but I'd have to say this was some of the most disappointing sushi I've had in a very long time. The rolls were sloppily rolled, part of me didn't want to believe a real sushi chef put that together but I was sitting at the bar watching him roll and it was horrific. Nothing about my meal was good besides the Sapporo lol."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal in all the times I've gone there. Good service. Friendly place. Great sushi"}
{"text":"During our stay in Scottsdale, we decided to stop by Hiro Sushi. Based on previous Yelp reviews I thought it was going to be mind blowing. I really wasn't impressed. The sushi is fresh, but the rolls are nothing to brag about. It was just ok.   Service was excellent, but I will not be visiting Hiro again."}
{"text":"Since my original review I've been back to Hiro and have had a plethora of their nigiri. Fresh, well prepared, tasty. If this were - say Seattle - it'd be 3 or possibly 4 stars but here in the valley Hiro is best-of-the-best. When I'm craving sushi this is definitely my go-to."}
{"text":"4.5 in my book.  The fish is beautifully cut, as well as generous in size.  And fresher than I've has in quite a while.  Nigiri was best, the rolls were yummy - Diamondback and Crazy - but not amazing.  But still really solid in technique and flavor.  Seaweed salad was perfectly seasoned, which is hard to find.  Make a reservation or be prepared to wait.  Sushi chefs are quite friendly; perhaps the hostess could take a few tips from them?"}
{"text":"First time trying sushi here. The customer service was off the charts. Our waiter was very attentive and considerate. She brought out two bowls for us to share an udon without us having to ask. She and the chef checked in on us periodically. The sushi was amazing. We orderded the blackdiamond special, a grilled mackerel, and nabeyaki udon. Everything tasted great. Overall, highly recommended.   Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Price: $$"}
{"text":"Sushi in the desert?   That's the question I always get from my out-of-town friends and family... and even my husband rarely eats sushi with me here in AZ.  But, my answer to that question is YES!  Especially if that sushi comes from Hiro.  I recently went to Hiro to celebrate a friend's birthday.  There were four of us and we ordered a variety of salads, rolls, and other menu offerings.  Every single thing we ordered was amazing... and oh so fresh!  Highlights included oysters, salmon sashimi that melted in my mouth, and the Arizona roll.    Service was attentive as well, and when it came time for dessert, the lights went out in the entire restaurant while the staff sang to my friend and brought out orange slices with a candle in it... the perfect sweet (and healthy) ending to a fabulous meal!  I will definitely be returning to Hiro and soon.  Anyone craving sushi? Let me know!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a great local place with fresh tasting sushi! The sushi chefs all greet you when you sit down. The place is relatively small so keep that in mind for large parties. We have been multiple times and never had a bad experience. It is consistently good and the staff is always nice. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We drove 20 mins to try this place. I was craving sushi while we're here in the phoenix/scottsdale area. Overall, I agree this is a good place. Not awesome but good enough. I definitely would come back again next time we're in town.  I didn't like the over salted edamame. Yuck. Cut back the salt please. The tempura udon was too SALTY. I ate the udon and didn't bother with the broth. This is the first place that separated the tempura from the broth. I never understood why they would place the tempura in the broth. It gets all soggy."}
{"text":"The food was good , it not great. The thing that bother me was there open tables and open seats and our party of three waited 45 minutes to be seated. While waiting it had a very unfriendly vibe. Pricing is also fair but not cheap."}
{"text":"This review has been summarized as I personally don't enjoy reading in-depth opinions on restaurants. I've pretty much copied the same format as ZAGAT & Michelin uses.   Ambiance = 3/5 Food = 4/5 Service = 4/5 Cost = 4/5"}
{"text":"I can't believe how underwhelmed I was when I initially visited Hiro.  Since that time, it has become one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona.  Besides more \"fast food\" type options, Hiro is one of our most frequented dining experiences and a constant reservation when we have guests.    One thing that you have to get past, is that it is in a strip mall.  The overall atmosphere when you first arrive leaves a little to be desired.  Once you enter, you are transported to a completely different area.  This does not feel like Arizona (especially Scottsdale) once inside.  It is small and dark and smells like sushi.  Sitting at the sushi bar is a must-do if you are there as a couple.  It is fun to interact with the employees making sushi.    We typically order the salmon skin roll (try it - its awesome!), the veggie roll (also great!), some sort of salmon nigiri, the tofu agedashi (another thing I highly recommend to anyone) and whatever sort of nigiri they recommend to us that night.  We have tried all sorts of non-menu items including fermented soybean rolls (not sure the actual name for that).  If you have any favorites, just ask, they always seem very willing to accommodate people's whims.  I also insist on the moshi before we go.  I'm sure its nothing special in terms of moshi in general, but its a favorite dessert of mine!    One tip - if you are interested in going, you will want a reservation.  If you can't (or don't) get one, you will likely have to wait or you may even get turned away if they have no tables opening up.  You cannot reserve the sushi bar - its first come first served, but its still typically a decent wait as well.  Reservations are definitely recommended and worth it!  If you can't get in, try Andreoli's across the street!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place for actual nigiri sushi as well as sashimi. The fish is always fresh and they have a great selection, not just your typical tuna, salmon, yellow tail and shrimp. If you're more about diversity than this is the place."}
{"text":"Expensive Chirashi bowl, for not much fish. Chirashi was 21.99, and came with about 5 pieces of fish. It was tasty though."}
{"text":"I was in Mesa for business and was in mood for sushi.  I searched Yelp for a highly recommended sushi restaurant and people highly suggested Hiro.  It was ok I guess if you don't know any better or if you were expecting more like I did. I ordered the more expensive stuff like giant clam, toro, and unagi. I also had a crunchy roll which was only mediocre. The tempura in it was cold and spicy tuna wasnt much or spicy and rice was soft and mushy. The toro tasted very frozen and only ok.  I would search again next time for another place. I will be out there again soon."}
{"text":"I hate to write bad reviews, but today's experience definitely left my party hungry and angry after having a lunch date at Hiro's.  First of all, the few items we tried were pretty good. That is where my original 4 stars went. Try the Crispy Shrimp (fried shrimp wrapped in potatoes), it is delicious and creative. Sashimi and nigiri were all great quality, so I definitely agree with all the positive reviews on the food here. Japanese Snapper sashimi was excellent too!  The reason I have taken away the 2 stars is the absolutely terrible service we received from the sushi chef that was servicing us (whom I am pretty sure was the head sushi chef and likely Hiro's son). We sat at the sushi bar, pretty much facing the chef, but we were never acknowledged, nor greeted. When the plates of items were handed to us, it was not stated what they were, if the chef decided to tell us, it was handed to us like we were a bother. He was EXTREMELY friendly and chatty with the people sitting on the left and right of us.   Not sure why we were singled out to be treated like a bother by the sushi chef. We know the waitress was overworked with the amount of guests today, but the sushi chef would spend 30 minutes chatting up the couple next to us, make special items for them to try, but when he finally made the few items for us, he would hand the plate to us one handed and look away, like no eye contact and not a hint of smile on his face! How rude!   When we asked for fresh grated wasabi, he gave us a giant pile of what appears to me to be a mixture of freshly grated horseradish mixed with wasabi powder. I am sorry, we have eaten at many sushi restaurants, and have had fresh grated wasabi before. That big pile of green stuff sir, was not freshly grated wasabi. If that was, we would have been happy to pay for it. But since it was simply piled on a little plate like it costs nothing, I am pretty sure my assumption was correct. Freshly grated horseradish does not equal freshly grated wasabi. It was like the sushi chef thinks that we have never had real sushi before.   We understand the turnaround of items we ordered were slow to show up due to the non-stop stream of customers coming in. However, we definitely did not feel welcome by the sushi chef at the sushi bar. We went there prepared to drop a few hundred dollars for excellent sushi, but was left with a bad taste in our mouth.  I am sorry, we will never return again, especially if we were such a bother to be served by the one sushi chef there. The great food was ruined by the bad service experience, bad mood does not make good food..."}
{"text":"This place has quite the reputation, highly rated on yelp and it's been recommended by many friends, so I HAD to try it.  The wait staff very attentive and lovely. The place is nice and quaint, which I'm a big fan of and the sushi was devine!   So excited to have such awesome sushi only 5mins from my house!"}
{"text":"Wow.  A plus.   I went here a long time ago and thought it was good but tonight blew me away.   Super good sushi.  Diamondback roll was awesome.  Only bad thing,. I are too much."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here.  We were suprised to have authentic Japanese sashimi, sushi, and appetizers in Arizona.  The sashimi was fresh.  Really enjoyed the Aji (Spanish Mackerel), Hamachi (Yellow tail), and other fish.  If your in town and love sashimi and sushi, this may be the best choice in the Phoenix, Scottsdale, AZ area.  Enjoy -!"}
{"text":"Omg!! Bet sushi in Arizona! I have been to  many many many sushi places here in Arizona and this place is the best ! The fish quality is amazing. Make sure you arrive early for dinner and on weekends because this place gets packed quick! The sushi bar is the best and the chefs are amazing! I went on a Saturday for dinner they open at 5 and we were there by 440 and there was a line then went back on Monday for lunch!!  if you love sushi this is the best place"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Saturday night.  Sat at the sushi bar and didn't have to wait.  The entire staff was warm and welcoming.  Ordered a cold Asahi and told the chef \"omakase\".  For those that aren't sure what that means, it is a phrase that means \"I'll leave it to you\".  In other words, I left it up to the chef and put my dinner in his hands.  He did not let me down.  He started me off with ankimo, tempura battered & deep fried squid, and grilled shishito peppers.  The ankimo was delicious, the squid was crispy and hot, and the shishito peppers were a great counter-balance to the richness of the other two dishes.  Next was a platter of sashimi followed by a dish of various nigiri sushi.  All the fish tested fresh and presentation was good.  By this point I was stuffed and couldn't eat another course.  Out came my check and a deep fried shrimp head for \"dessert\" as my waiter called it.  It was crispy, hot, flavorful and was a nice finishing touch to the very good meal that I just had.  Overall, I was highly satisfied with my meal and will certainly go back.  A lot of places really push those bastardized garbage sushi rolls filled with cream cheese, drenched in sauce, and deep fried to high heaven.  Thank goodness I didn't see a whole lot of that being served here."}
{"text":"in scottsdale? wanna have good sushi? look no further. come on down to hiro! you'll be a hiro to all of your dining company! ;)  service was good. staff were nice and kept apologized often as we waited for a table.  a little kid bumped their head really hard on the wall and without any hesitation a staff went and got a bag of ice to help with any upcoming bumps. that's definitely top notch service.   ordered: *salmon sashmi-tastes fresh!! yum! melts in your mouth. wasn't fishy at all. definitely order! *uni- this did taste fishy so i wasn't a fan of it whatsoever. *hiro roll $13.95- i really liked this roll. it had salmon, white fish, yellowtail, asparagus, imitation crab meat baked with eel sauce.  *baked mussels- not the absolute best that i've had but pretty darn good. this yelper has no complaints. i would recommend this if you are a fan of baked mussels.  *spider roll $9.95 - its the usual deep fried soft shelled crab w/ avocado cucumber and mayo. my husbands coworkers liked it. so i would say get it if you're a fan of the spider roll. you can't go wrong with a classic roll.  *octopus-my husband and his coworkers liked it. they thought it was fresh and tasty. so i would definitely recommend!   tips: *takes reservations *plenty of parking spots shared with other businesses. *located really close to the freeway *hard to spot at night as the lighting is very dimmed at night.  *takes credit card and cash *serves alcohol *staff appears to be authentic japanese."}
{"text":"This spot is right in our neighborhood, but because we have a favorite sushi place nearby, we had never tried it. A friend told us to try it. We were not disappointed!  My husband and I really dislike the \"Scottsdale Sushi\" experience where women are falling out of their dresses, music is loud and the sushi tastes like it was made last week.....worse yet, the people eating it don't know the difference.  When we walked in the door at Hiro we knew we were in for a treat. A true Sushi room, Hiro is all about the Sushi. No music was playing, the sushi chefs were artists. Sitting at the bar was a joy. Eating in the presence of true Sushi lovers was also a joy. The Sashimi my husband ordered was \"the freshest he has tasted\" and everything else was amazing. For a little more money, we enjoyed fantasic sushi in a tiny and cozy space with great energy and wonderful service. This will be our spot from now on!"}
{"text":"Love Hiro Sushi!  It's my favorite neighborhood sushi spot.  The fish is so fresh and always good.  The people that work there are friendly and it's always a good time.  Sushi can vary quite a lot from place to place and to find one that is consistent and always good is a great thing!  It's become a weekly visit whenever we're in town."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in the Phoenix area. Believe me, I have been looking for good sushi here ever since I moved from Dallas to Phoenix three months ago.   What I ordered: - Grilled Mackerel Appetizer (cooked): YUM. If you are like me and love fishy/salty foods, this will hit the spot.  - Fresh Salmon Nigiri (raw): I always order this at sushi restaurants and base the freshness of the salmon on whether I will come back or not. Kinda been disappointed with other restaurants but Hiro Sushi's was excellent.  - Spicy Salmon Roll (raw): Good as usual. - Escolar Nigiri (white tuna- raw): Melts in your mouth good. They put a little bit of pico on top which I am not used to but it works.   For those of you who don't like seafood and are forced to accompany your friends or significant other to sushi, my boyfriend loves the vegetable roll. They actually put an assortment of veggies in this roll, not just cucumbers and carrots.   Other than that, service is helpful and friendly. Prices are a bit high, but if you are looking for quality fish, this place is worth it."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and the service is wonderful , now here come the complaints  We ordered yellowtail sushi I and only received 5 slices. We ordered Saba sushi the slices of fish were noticeably small   The dinner was 80 bucks. I thought the portions should be better. They are suppose to serve exactly the same size...henceforth the consistency feature of the food and all the trouble becoming a sushi chef. If consistency means nothing anyone can do it, right ? Well Hiro did it wrong. We were very disappointed. We can eat anywhere for 50 bucks and get much more food.  I'm always starving so it will be hard to return."}
{"text":"Tasty sushi. Decent service. Good prices. Would recommend."}
{"text":"The best Salmon Bento in town They actually crisp the skin on the salmon, hmmm! Try the real crab California rolls"}
{"text":"This is simply the Best Sushi I have ever experienced. My wife and I tried different seasonal specialties like the Matsutaki mush teapot soup, (jaw dropping) to the dynamit oyster which was sublime. I cannot say enough about this place. The outside is lowkey but insidecis paradise!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arizona!!! Come here all the time, it's right down the street. Found it on Yelp. I'm from NY and it is right up there with some of the best sushi I've had."}
{"text":"Chicken was good, salad was tasty and the California roll and soup were not enjoyable.  This place wouldn't last in LA. Checked out the sushi in the case and went with a safe option."}
{"text":"My $50 small meal did not turn out well. Sashimi was not fresh and the rolls tasted weird. Let's just say, I had to stop eating the rolls and  I was close to regurgitation. Staff was fine, but the food is not up to par."}
{"text":"Great place! Great service awesome food, fish was fresh and delicious. We eat a lot of sushi in Phoenix and this was one of the best places we have been. Try the oysters!"}
{"text":"The best sushi in town! Not cheap but worth it. Making a reservation is almost a must because the place is small and fills up quickly.  Food and service are top notch."}
{"text":"I like this place because their fish is fresh but on more than one occasion, I've had to find another place to eat because the wait was too long."}
{"text":"I agree with another review that I read. This sushi rolls were limited and nothing special. Stick with the sashimi or nigiri. The fish was REALLY fresh, especially the blue fin tuna toro. The fatty slice of fish just melts in your mouth as you bite into it, delicious!! The other downside was the cost of this place, pretty expensive... should be more like $$$"}
{"text":"I have lived in Japan for years, very particular about Japanese food. This is the one of the BEST in the Valley. If you love Soba, you should NEVER miss Okinawa Soba in their menu. The soup and ribs are so delicious, plus the special Vodka chilli sauce...every friend I brought there loved it! Their lunch/dinner menu with teriyaki chicken and Tempura is equally fantastic! Although is quite pricy, but the service is great."}
{"text":"This little place is busy!   I tried the Donkatsu appetizer, toro and tuna nigiri, and spider roll. I thought the donkatsu was good, but a little dry and tougher than some others. The toro and tuna portion was a little on the small size as well. I thought the spider roll was great- I loved the cucumber mixed with mayo in the roll. Asahi on draft was the cherry on top.  Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Great Japanese flavors! My husband and I were here for dinner on Sunday and we loved it. Being vegetarian, our choices were limited. Nevertheless, the Vegetable Tempura and Vegetable Sushi Rolls served with the soy and dipping sauce was beyond yummy! Staff was extremely friendly and courteous and service was quick. Great ambience too! We'll surely be making this place a regular!"}
{"text":"I approve of this place. Although the food is not phenomenal, this is the best I have found across the valley so far. The food tastes authentic and there are actual Japanese people working. This place is simply at another level compared with the many fake sushi places around."}
{"text":"Hiro Sushi is my favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix. I am there at least once a week, some time more.  The food is great and well priced and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm very sorry fellow yelpers, but the yelp rating on thie place has left  me in quite a quandry.  After moving to the east side of the valley, hubby and I were looking for a new \"neighborhood sushi\" that was closer than Glendale.  On the positive side,  this place is authentically Japanese.  The sushi selection was just OK on the night that we went.  The fish:rice ratio was right on.  The rolls were not over-stuffed with rice either.  They have a very good selection of sake and authentic appetizers.  More importantly the selections ranged quite a bit in freshness and quality.  Some of the more expensive nigiri pieces were very good, but the $2.95 nigiri menu items were awful such as the eel and the ebi.     In my book, selling old and bad fish is inexcusable at any cost.  Unfortunately, our search for the neighborhood sushi restaurant continues."}
{"text":"My husband said this was the best sushi he's ever had in AZ and that's saying a lot since he is from Hawaii. I only had cooked items due to being pregnant but everything was amazing, nonetheless. Service was top notch- from our waitress to the sushi chefs. We are very excited for them to open one up on the east side in a few months! This will definitely be our go to spot."}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy!!  Always ask them to prepare something off menu, you won't be disappointed! We dine here once a week and have never had a bad meal, the sushi is always fresh and service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Four years of searching for good sushi- this is it!  Not fancy.  Down to earth.  Fresh. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"There's that old saying \"Don't judge a book by its cover\", and in this case, it applies to Hiro's in spades.  Ignore the fact it's in a strip mall, and looks closed from the outside due to the shades being tightly drawn all the time.  Ignore the fact that there are so few tables and the host/hostess at the front can be a little bit terse at times.    Once you get seated, you'll be treated to moutwateringly amazing sushi that rivals some of the best I've had in cities with much more direct access to fresh seafood (Seattle, LA, San francisco).  Everything we ordered was delicious and it was so good, I ended up here for dinner here twice in the same week.  My only hesitation in writing this review is that it will encourage more people to dine here which will make it harder for me to get a table :)"}
{"text":"Wow.  I just realized I have never Yelped about Hiro.  Way before Yelp, I reviewed Hiro on some other website, and I think what I wrote ended up on an award displayed on the restaurant's wall for being \"best sushi\" in Phoenix.  Anyway - About the food...  First and foremost, the fish is flown in DAILY.  Not once a week, not every other day, DAILY.  Ask what is fresh that day, and you are sure to get the freshest fish in town, even on a Sunday!  I love sashimi - no rice, no roll, just raw fish - and Hiro's is the tops.  While they haven't had it in a while, the Striped Jack is my all-time favorite, but give me any sweet, buttery, or somewhat firm fish from Hiro, and I am in heaven.  BTW, don't let the strip-mall location scare you away.  What it does say about this oh-so-awesome sushi bar  is that it is a place to get damned good sushi, not to be seen.  If you want the typical Scottsdale bar scene quasi-japanese restaurants better known for happy hour specials than fish, don't go to Hiro.  If you want the best sushi in the Southwest, take a drive to Hiro."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is the best sushi place in the Phoenix area! It's small and quaint but that's what is so charming about this place. On my first night in Phoenix, I tried the fancy schmancy Roka Akor...let me tell ya, this place trumps Roka Akor. The menu here is simple and very typical of a Japanese sushi restaurant but you can tell that they put so much care and precision into making all of their dishes.   Ordered about 4 rolls between my friend and me (yes, 4 rolls for 2 people!) and we demolished everything. We were VERY full afterwards but were VERY satisfied. The quality of the raw fish is really up there and even the sushi rice is quality sushi rice. I hate overly sauced rolls but Hiro Sushi does a good job of keeping the balance between all the components of making a great sushi roll. Thanks for a great lunch, Hiro!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Sit at the sushi bar. Ask the sushi chef to drive. It's incredible. The toro, the snapper and the jumbo clam were out of the world. The toro handroll was maybe the best handroll I've had in my life."}
{"text":"This place gets it right on all levels.  Extremely friendly and attentive staff, knowledgable and enthusiastic sushi chefs, superior grade sashimi, an eclectic variety of specials, and a menu that offers everything from Soba noodles to Chicken Teriyaki.  On our visit, we sampled the following specials:  Jellyfish Sunomono (a jellyfish and cucumber salad.  Jellyfish has virtually the same texture and taste as a seaweed salad) Ankimo or Monkfish Pate: It is essentially a sea foie gras and comes from a fish whose flavor is likened to lobster.  On its own the flavor is lacking, but dipped in a citrus ponzu it is delectable! Agemono Ibodai or Fried Butterfish: Even though the fish is served whole, the tender meat from the belly is cut up, fried individually, and made easy for eating by hand.  For our main course, we asked the sushi chef to create a Sashimi plate for us.  It included:  Kazunoko, or Herring roe.  It was pinkish, firm, and with a rubbery texture and appearance.  It came in a single cohesive mass and so it looked like a piece of sushi, but was crunchy and overall strange. Abura Bouzu or Escolar.  This is not to be confused with white tuna, or pretty much any type of sushi you have ever had.  I have to say that it was the most delectable, soft, creamy, rich fish I have ever had.  Better than a cut of Bluefin Toro!  Bright white in color and quite fatty, this fish is not always easy to find - in fact you will rarely see it on sushi menus due to the high levels of fatty esters.  It is known to cause digestive issues with some individuals, and for that reason has been prohibited in Japan since the 1970s.  I myself had mild cramping later that evening, but I can honestly say it's worth it! Whitefish: Less fatty than salmon.  It certainly has a lighter, smoother flavor - but I prefer more fat and texture in my sushi. Ahi Maguro or Yellowfin Tuna: Beautiful deep red color, soft, meaty texture and clean taste.  Wonderful fish!  With a large bottle of hot Osake Sake, our bill was about $100.  I believe the majority of the cost came from the chef's special sashimi platter, as the average cost of a special was about $8.  This is definitely a place for people who know and love good sushi, and would highly recommend it.  Not only for the quality of its dishes, but the wonderful service."}
{"text":"For once they didn't run out of monkfish liver!!!!! Best quality I've had yet. So rich and buttery. The salmon sashimi here is also like crack. It's better than anywhere else. Tiny little restaurant but I love it."}
{"text":"This is, truly, as good as it gets. And not just in Arizona, but anywhere. As someone from California with access to exceptional sushi any time any place, I can confidently say that Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale AZ is the clear and indisputable best.  The chefs are astoundingly well trained -- Hiro himself trained in Japan for over 25 years. I consider it a kindness that he brought such an art to the desert. Not a single cut is sloppy.  The hard-to-find items can all be found here.  The Hiro website advertises that they do not have \"trendy\" sushi. While this is true, Hiro and his team do embrace the local culture and incorporate it into their menu through fun local-inspired items like a Diamonback Roll.  Hiro brought culture to Arizona and brought Arizona culture to sushi.  The sushi is not the only amazing dish featured on their menu. All of the soups and entrees are also delicious and authentic."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had!  It's so fresh, it's so melt-in-your mouth delicious, it's pretty much the best sushi I've had the pleasure of trying.  Our party ordered lots of salmon, lots of tuna, and my all time favorite, lots of yellowtail.  We also had a variety of rolls too.  Everything, from the appetizer to the sushi was omnomnom.  The seaweed salad was perfectly seasoned, probably the best I've had.  The fish was generously and perfectly cut.  I'm usually not a fan of tuna, but the tuna was so delicious, I ate lots of it.  Obviously I stuffed myself with salmon and yellowtail nigiri.  I'm pretty sure I gained 20lbs after gobbling up everything."}
{"text":"Just when I thought I would never find good sushi in AZ (and I have really, really tried) I walked into Hiro.  I heard the banter in between the sushi chefs in Japanese and knew I had found what I had been looking for.  Yes!  A REAL Japanese sushi restaurant.  I have been there three times now, and have loved every visit.  It is a place to eat and enjoy the food, not a strangely-lit cocktail lounge pretending to be a sushi bar.  The fish is fresh, the edamame is warm and salty, and the beer is cold.  What else can you ask for?  Thank you Hiro Sushi!"}
{"text":"The small little restaurant makes this place totally deceiving. This is actually one of the best sushi joints I have ever been to! Not only do they deliver the food quickly after you order, it's all fresh! And by fresh I mean when my fried avocado roll was delivered to me, it was still piping hot and when I bit into it there was still a crispy crunch to it! Typically, whenever I eat a fried avocado roll at other sushi joints, the roll wouldn't be as hot so that meant the texture of the roll itself wouldn't be as crisp. The cucumber salad has the perfect taste of sour to it while still containing it crunchy texture, probably the best cucumber salad I've ever tried! Not only that, but the staff overall were wonderful and they truly know how to treat their customers well! The secret behind a successful business is through an amazing team that know a thing or two about quality customer service, and this place has got it!"}
{"text":"If you're here for lunch, do the lunch combo: mixed tempura and fried oysters!  Sushi is great here is well. The atmosphere is kinda tight and noisy but during lunch hours on weekdays it is to be expected with all the business people who come here for feeding time. The lunch menu is decently priced and the food is great and the service is awesome."}
{"text":"I've been searching for high quality sushi for months, and I finally found it!    Hiro is a smaller, unpretentious establishment with enthusiastic and well-trained sushi chefs. We sat at the sushi bar (we opted for first-available seating)--I loved watching the chefs slice each cut of fish with precision and flawless technique.   Hiro gets my stamp of approval because they actually listened to me when I said I wanted a LOT of ginger. Yes, an entire plate piled high is what I mean by a lot!  Thank you Hiro!  We had edamame (perfectly cooked with just the right amount of salt), the squid salad (the sauce was the perfect compliment to the fish), crazy roll, striped roll, and unagi, tuna and scallop nigri. Each cut of fish was extremely generous and tasted fresh. There was a LOT of rice in the crazy roll, which was good (balanced out the tempura shrimp) and bad (I prefer to fill up on fish, not rice).     Everything is made-to-order, and the chefs hand over the plates with pride; I've been to countless sushi joints where the chefs whip out as much product as they can without giving any care to the quality.  Not at Hiro!  Everything comes together deliciously because of their carefully prepared components.   We finished with the hot green tea--no need for sugar here because of its subtle (not artificial!) sweetness.  My favorite part was the mochi!  They serve the best kind, something I've been searching for since Sushi Den and Izakaya Den (premier sushi restaurants) in Denver. We had the red bean and green tea. Mochi is hard to describe, but its a creamy, perfectly portioned, and refreshing treat!"}
{"text":"Fresh great selection very authentic fish place. Jenki's new favorite  in AZ bam!  I will now come here every month  best fresh in AZ!"}
{"text":"The BEST of the BEST for sushi in Phoenix! This review is long overdue. I'm been coming here for years. I used to live right down the street and would come 3 times a week. Now I don't get to come as often but the food is AMAZING and so fresh! They Ankimo, Uni, Oysters and all the great things that not every sushi place carriers. All the staff are very attentive and friendly. It's a small place and can fill up quickly. Sit at the sushi bar and say \"hi\" to Hiro...he's the best there is!"}
{"text":"Must go!  Arguably one of the best sushi spots in Phoenix, if not Arizona.  We visit Hiro at least once a month for our sushi fix."}
{"text":"Great sushi. The menu is definitely authentic. This gets them five stars. Service is prompt but not as constant as in most American restaurants. If you need something just look or motion towards the wait staff. This is a good thing in my opinion as I prefer to eat in peace."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for dinner.  We arrived right after it opened at 5pm and had to sit at the bar (I'd recommend calling during the lunch hour to reserve a table if you're going for dinner).  The service was a bit slow and not particularly friendly (the sushi chef was nice though).  We ordered the dumplings appetizer, the California roll, Philadelphia roll and shrimp tempura rolls.  I liked everything but the Philadelphia roll wasn't my favorite (my husband liked it).  I'd recommend if you're in the mood for sushi."}
{"text":"Best and freshest sushi in AZ period. Even rivaling many out of state sushi places. Yummy. Small place would recommend reservations."}
{"text":"Some of the best, freshest, and tastiest sushi I've ever had! Friendly staff and a cute setup inside.  Kudos to a great experience!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot in Arizona! The fish is always super fresh and they always have multple \"catch of the day\" and last time I went I got possibly the greatest thing I have ever eaten..Blue Fin toro. This place is a hot spot and they do not take reservations so I suggest gettig there early."}
{"text":"Its good don't get me wrong. I've heard there is a soup to die for but I have yet to enjoy that. The sushi is great but the sushi for what it is I think is highly overpriced. 2 rolls for me for $30 is a tad steep but then again...welcome to Scottsdale. You do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of sushi, and I'm a snobby bitch about it, so that might translate to the fact that I'm a decent critic of sushi, or just that I'm a snobby bitch. Either way, I attest that Hiro stands out above the sushi fray in Scottsdale where there's a sushi joint for every man, woman & child. If you don't believe me, well... more sushi for me.   Hiro is not a place to be seen. Its about the chow, and to say its old school is like saying Sarah Palin might have had an Alex P Keaton poster on her wall in high school.   The fish is spectacular, the plating is gorgeous, but perhaps most notable is the expertise. I sat in front of Take, one of the four chefs on staff and was mezmerized watching him cut fish. I mean.... I've been to some acclaimed sushi restaurants.. but there is just something when you watch someone who lives this stuff, rather than just someone who's come to it by trade.   On my last visit, there were a number of Japanese businessmen who came in, with their own sake, and sat in front of Hiro himself. This says a lot, and if you experience the same, follow our advice: say to the chef: \"we'll have whatever they have\"."}
{"text":"I went here for the second time. It has been more than 4 years since the first visit. We ordered tons of sushi and sashimi and mixed tempura. Our expectation was pretty high due to its great reviews. The first dish was their special order, snapper sashimi. The snapper was really good and fresh. Then scallop, toro, eel, fatty tuna, tamago, hamachi, yello tail and uni came out. Lot of them, right?.  The rice under the sushi were not so tasty and did not blend well with the sushi. The sushi piece were too thin cut. It was fresh at least. We were pretty disappointed by its overall taste. The mixed tempura were lacking its crispyness and the miso soup was not even hot. Overall, bit disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place.  Had the blue fin tuna, tuna belly, Spanish mackerel ... All of it was great."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a nice find in the Scottsdale area. The seating is pretty tight though, so make sure to get here earlier/later than the typical lunch or dinner rush. We've ordered their bentos and Katsu-don. - Bentos: more like your typical Japanese bento; impressive selection = fried oysters (a unique find). The mixed tempura is actually quite nice and juicy. The shrimp especially is more meat-like and high quality. - Katsu-don: HUGE portion of rice! We had to take the leftovers home. Overall, the dish was very delicious and reminded me of the katsu-don I've tried in Japan. Would recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese cuisine. Best sushi and sashimi in town, they even have chirashi on the menu and sauteed gobo (burdock root). Sashimi is always fresh, prices are very reasonable. They also have a great lunch special.  I took my four-year-old, who enjoyed the chicken katsu."}
{"text":"Ok first off, the -2 stars is not because of sushi quality. The quality of sushi is very good. Fresh meat & good preparation. The only issue was pricing.   I ordered take out & they didn't list the prices on their website (at least then they didn't). I go to pick it up & it came out to $70 for only 8 piece nigiri & 3 maki rolls. To me, that is too expensive for just \"good\" sushi. Just list your prices so people know how much their totals will be."}
{"text":"Delicious. Cozy atmosphere. And delightful serving woman. Very legitimately Japanese place. Great place."}
{"text":"Hiro Sushi is the best. They are friendly, clean and the food is for real. No fake sushi here!!  They serve the real thing."}
{"text":"Ehhh (it's okay but nothing mind-blowing).  I tried their Philly roll, Rainbow roll, and Spicy Tuna roll. Little disappointed w/their Spicy tuna - I didn't feel any degree of warmth on those.  In general, I felt that their seafood wasn't the freshest, but I realize that this is challenging as we're in the middle of the Sonoran Desert. Prices were a tad high also.  Best I had was their Seaweed Salad - so yummy! Spices were perfect!  Their ambience was rather sub-par, IMO. You walk in and it's a tiny little waiting room w/chairs that scream that they're from 1988. Additionally, they had a wall of framed photos of past patrons w/their autograph? Hmm - looked very dated and sorta junky/cluttered. Some photos were faded - this makes me scared to eat their food...  They could do a makeover and do like a modern/contemporary and Asian hybrid look."}
{"text":"Some of the worst sushi I've had in Phoenix. I don't get the hype. The people were nice but service was slow. Waste of $22 for lunch. Very dark inside. I'll take nori, sakana or the place in downtown Phoenix with the purple rice instead. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi restaurant! Hiro Sushi serves high quality authentic Japanese sushi and other fish dishes. If you want to try real Japanese food, I would highly suggest to try here. It is pricey but definitely worth it!   Comparison with other restaurant: Hiro Sushi Vs. Shimogamo  I would like to visit Hiro Sushi. Shimogamo is very good but certain rolls and sushi is just okay. I tried few different dishes from Hiro Sushi such as nigiri, Grilled Miso Black Cod, and other dishes. I was satisfied with all dishes :D"}
{"text":"Loved loved loved every bite! Sushi was so fresh it could have been caught today! Great service and some of the best sushi I've had in AZ!"}
{"text":"I love this sushi restaurant alot, but the only problem is that it's really, really small. It's almost impossible to walk in and get a table without waiting. We have been here 4 times and have had to wait an hour or gotten take out because they are closed to seating. During the cooler months there's just no way you are getting in here so don't even bother. They do accept reservations but def book WAY ahead to get your preferred date & time. Ok, enough about that, sorry to be a debbie downer there, but you gotta know what to expect. I can't fault this place for it's incredible popularity. The prices are reasonable and the portions are decent. I love that there are always Japanese folks in here dining. That always tells me something....that the place is good and the locals know! I've never sat at the sushi bar but the table service is very attentive and fast. The food as I mentioned is delicious and well worth it. Get hooked on this place during the summer and do take-out during the winter. That's as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"We had 9 dishes on the day before the new year eve. This place was packed and it is recommended to make a reservation. All shellfish and fish were so fresh (Abalone, conch, giant clam, snow crab, toro, striped jack, etc). Deep fried pompano and smelt fishes were so tasty, especially with tangy salty sauces. The eggplant with miso was also delicious with the taste of charcoal grilled. We could order more but we were so full. We are really enjoy their food and their sushi bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"I still maintain that a great sushi bar does not have to be near a coast to be fantastic!   Hiro unfortunately is just not all that great. Rice was overcooked and grainy. The variety of fish was ok, the quality was mediocre.   Fish does not have to be caught the same day to be the best tasting.  Ask Any sushi chef and he will tell you that there are certain species that taste better a few days old. So it comes to selection, storage, and cut.     Toro was served so cold it almost felt frozen, a few others were too cold as well.   Tai was not the same premium tai that you Might find at a 5 star sushi bar.   I'm sure there is a great sushi bar in the Phoenix area, but Hiro is not it."}
{"text":"What a gem they have here. The staff were very helpful and attentive, the food was excellent. And they have nato! Can be crowded, so pick your time carefully. Plus people hang around too long and like to watch us wait, don't they? Great sushi, soup, and I got the meat dish which was exceptional."}
{"text":"Best sushi in scottsdale hands down. Really fresh fish. Try the spicy mussels...they're amazing. The only bummer is they don't have a full bar. If they did it would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Sake (sushi) was fresh. Nigiri was cold and top notch.   Rainbow roll was my fav. Exceptional service. Spicy rolls were ground - which I do not prefer, but tasty."}
{"text":"We arrived and it was hardly any cars in the lot so we got kind of concerned. Reluctantly we went in and found it packed out! We ordered 4 rolls and it was so much we couldn't finish it all. The sushi was fresh and had good flavor. I've had better but it was solid."}
{"text":"Wow, not a fan.  Had high expectations.  We ordered the lunch special, 3 hand rolled items, which were conical wraps with too much nori.  The food on the plate, upon arrival, smelled fishy and then the wraps  tasted fishy.  The salmon skin instead of salmon filling was just gross.  It seemed as though leftover, not-so-fresh ends and pieces were ground together and stuffed in the wraps.  On the plus side, the miso soup and small side salad were delicious.  Service was OK until our waitress saw our uneaten food and said something about sloppy instead of asking how the food was.  What???!!!"}
{"text":"Good things come in small packages. Five stars for the food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Overall it's definitely not my favorite sushi place in the whole world. It's small and often feels cramped, the service is spotty (like they're nice but are not very attentive which is somewhat surprising considering how small it is) also its always noisy and the sushi selection isn't as good as it could be butttt it's virtually the only authentic Japanese restaurant in the area that's not terribly americanized. Also the rolls the do serve are good in the sense that the fish tastes good and fresh...I guess I just don't absolutely adore them though because they use this weird soy paper instead of seaweed, they don't offer many dishes with eel which is my favorite,  and they I just wish they utilized more ingredients and sauces to mix it up a bit. So overall not the best place ever but it's authentic, the fish is good quality, and the chefs are always nice so if you want sushi and it has to be in Scottsdale this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Like all great sushi restaurants they are typically found in a unsuspecting strip malls and Hiro sushi is no exception to this rule. To tell you I love Hiro Sushi would be an understatement... The fish here is beyond fresh, I wasn't a fan of Salmon sashimi until I ate theirs. I swear on my cocker spaniels life that I could sit there and eat my weight in their in salmon sashimi. Sushi chefs were always totally friendly and helpful, and service was always spot on.   I am not a huge roll gal, but their rolls are pretty amazing as well... I highly recommend their Arizona roll.  So if your looking for some great sushi this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi in town, right up there with Yasu, Hana, and the like. Unpretentious (I dare say \"bare bones\") strip mall spot with about 12 tables and maybe 18 seats at the sushi bar. Not a scottsdale scene at all. Good $10-18 lunch specials that are large and hearty. Sushi prices are about average for the valley. It's always fresh, always high quality, and always delicious. Hiro watches over the show and makes sure all the quality is up to his standards. There's always something rare or unusual on the specials board that other more standard sushi places would never carry (like conch, giant clam, jellyfish, toro, etc). Service is ok, though the servers tend to be a little confused and try to do too many jobs. If you're at the sushi bar just ask your chef and he'll set the servers straight. It can be crowded at night so be sure to call for a reservation if you're more than one or two people. Only complaint I have is that the cooked food from the kitchen doesn't keep up with the quality of the sushi. Cooked food is kind of an afterthought here. They have some standard items but if you're looking for something adventurous or a nice steak this isn't your spot. But if you're feeling sushi, go here for sure."}
{"text":"I have been a customer since the grand opening day in 1998. I am from the NY city area and know what great sushi is.  This is the only place to get good sushi here in AZ.  There are a lot of sushi places,  but this one has Toro (blue-fin tuna) when in season.  Most places out here wont buy it because they cant sell enough of it to make it worthwhile.  All those in the \"sushi know\" eat at Hiro.  Hiro is from Japan and has brought his local knowledge to our little corner of Scottsdale.  If you have to impress an out of towner, perhaps from California, take them here.  They'll realize you don't have to live on a coast to get fresh fish.  I have never had a bad meal.  Go be impressed, worth the wait."}
{"text":"Made a reservation and arrived on time. Hostess said they were running behind - which is understandable - and we would be seated next. She then proceeded to seat a large party in front of us. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was that my father and I only had to wait 15 minutes on a Friday night to get a spot. We ordered drinks, the wine is way over priced and a poor selection. But why do you go to a sushi place? For sushi of course. The selection was not vast and what we did order was decent at best. Our \"volcano\" app came after the rest of our meal. I will be checking out other restaurants before I go back here."}
{"text":"Everything is always fresh and yummy! Never a disappointment, you can't go wrong when choosing a sushi restaurant. We'll be back, as always."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend for dinner last night and was very impressed with the warm ambiance! Cute place and very friendly employees. The salmon nigiri was fresh and flavorful, and I HAD to attach a picture of our Caterpillar Roll. Just TRY and tell me that is not the cutest thing you've ever seen!! :) Thank you Hiro for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"i absolutely love this place. super fresh, authentic, delicious, and good service. definitely the best sushi around."}
{"text":"today I went there for dinner. boy, the quality drop significantly. the fish was bad. the rice was bad. after all this time, :( I guess its time to start looking for new sushi place."}
{"text":"A Sushi bar that's all about substance and not flash! Hiro doesn't waste its space with a dark or flashy ambiance. It's a tiny restaurant with its Sushi bar on one side, and around a dozen tables on the other. You won't find the loud music and the Old Town crowd at this place. Instead, you'll find some of the best rolls in Arizona.   We had orders of Spicy Tuna Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll, and asked them to make a Salmon and Avocado Roll (a great call by my girlfriend), and a small bottle of Saki. Hiro has a pretty good selection of Saki, not just the cheapest stuff to heat up for a Bomber. All three rolls may be simple, but with full confidence I can say they were better than all of the more popular Sushi bars.   The staff is also very friendly. As we got up to leave we got a \"goodbye\" and \"Thank you\" from the server, all the chefs at the Sushi bar, and the hostess. As much as I enjoy the \"scenery\" at the flashy Scottsdale Sushi bars. I'm not going complain that I got to enjoy Sushi without them. If you're looking for great rolls, head to Hiro."}
{"text":"Love this place. A must if you are in the Phoenix area. The Spanish mackerel is amazing. Check out the Diamondback roll, so yummy. We love how fresh everything is. One of our top two sushi places in the country!"}
{"text":"Great service, great and fresh quality food, and huge portions (dare I say almost too big!). Lots of home made items from the kitchen to perfectly balance the high quality sushi."}
{"text":"Fantastic sashimi, great service, and pretty decently priced for the quality and quantity. It doesn't bring the ritziness or glamour like Ra or Stingray in terms of fancy rolls, environment, or location, but it's definitely one of the best sushi places I've found in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is the only Sushi restraunt in the Phoenix area that I've eatten at and I see no reason to go anywhere else.  The place is run by Japanese staff and frequented by a large population of Japanese customers.    Just a little shop, simple decor and great food."}
{"text":"In the desert, an unlikely suitor emerges....  The verdict? Best authentic sushi I've had south of the Mason-Dixon Line. 5/7 with rice."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi.  Hiro's has become our go-to sushi restaurant for whenever we come out to AZ during Spring Training.  The sushi chefs were extremely skilled and personable.  I'd highly recommend the bluefin toro, spanish mackerel, striped jack and halibut fin.  The snapper carpaccio was also fantastic.  Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Simply excellent on every count...quality, variety, service, portion, vibe...bravo!!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for fresh catch of the day, real authentic Japanese food cooked from real Japanese people, this is the place. Everything is so Japanese, small place and so cozy! Hiro the chef is amazing. They speak just Japanese ;)"}
{"text":"Judy? More like Rude-y.   My family and I were so excited to eat here and was ready to walk out the second we were greeted by Judy. She was rude and unfriendly. She barely greeted us. She was in such a rush, didn't care to have any conversation with us, checked on us once and didn't refill our drinks once. She had an attitude when we were ordering and made everyone feel so uncomfortable and rushed, nope unacceptable. Just an unsatisfying experience at this restaurant, there were reviews from yesterday that said the server was rude, he wasn't lying.  Also, it's 18% added gratuity for parties 6 or more.   Did she deserve 18%? Hell to the no. More like 5%.  If you want excellent service & excellent food, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  That is all. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We liked the food, the variety, We didn't like the wait, or the service, i still give it a 5 because of the variety of fish, I am not about the cooked food or the california rolls , give me some good old sashimi, and variety that is fresh. and I will be there  Too bad you can't get good service with good food."}
{"text":"Finally found a great sushi spot in Arizona. Definitely will come back again. Their vegetable roll was the best. Veggies were so fresh!"}
{"text":"Suffered a senior moment today! Did the yelp check and thought this sounds good...the drive was very dejavu and then I discovered why....see previous review! lol .....but to update....the volcano appetizer, sedona roll and Mochi Icecream (which I am becoming addicted to) were all wonderful. Our waitress was also fantastic bringing plenty of their delicious iced tea and keeping the ginger bowl full....a necessity for me. The place was full tonight and I can see why. Question is will I remember?"}
{"text":"Good friendly service but several things I tasted seemed stale, especially the fried items. The Vegas roll also tasted very fishy."}
{"text":"I did the Omakase in Scottsdale this week! Good sashimi, and cozy atmosphere. Saki bottles are opened and they serve smaller carafe if you don't have the need for the entire bottle. If you want a better crowd go to the Sushi Roku at the W Hotel on Camelback Rd."}
{"text":"Every time I come back to town I have to go to Hiro Sushi. This restaurant is a gem in North Scottsdale. The sashimi is very fresh and the sushi is outstanding. It's hidden in a strip mall but I can tell you this is some of the best sushi I've had on the west coast price wise."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great. Authentic Japanese sushi bar. All the sushi chefs spoke Japanese as well as English.   I ordered the hiro roll, Las Vegas roll and one other roll. They were all delicious. The Las Vegas roll was one of the best Vegas rolls I've ever had. Their green tea would taste better sweetened.their miso soup was also delicious."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for his birthday dinner and we are both completely blown away with the freshness of the sashimi. We ordered 2 salmon sashimi, king crab rolls, toro sashimi, 2 orders of oysters, clam dynamite, nabeyaki udon, and some drinks on top of that. We will definitely make another appearance soon at this little gem."}
{"text":"Wow!! We came here for our 3 year anniversary dinner we are both huge sushi fans, this place blew me out of the water the fish was fresh and had amazing taste. I'm glad we made sure to get a reservation because it was really busy. I will throw this out here if you are in a rush....DONT GO HERE....BUT.. if you have time to sit down and enjoy the company you are with and have and long dinner this is your place. It's and little gem. I do recommend getting an appetizer or getting plates you can share as most plates come one and a time so one person may be eating and yhe other person may not have anything, which if that doesn't bother you than awesome, some people however it might.  Will make sure to come here again!!"}
{"text":"All i can say is we loved this place after finding it on yelp - great food and fine service in a relaxed, unself- conscious setting. No pretense at Hiro and that is so refreshing. Next time we are in the Phoenix area we are sure to.come back. Thanks Hiro and company and keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This sushi is the only sushi my Japanese wife and I will eat in Arizona. Hiro is so particular on presentation and quality, everywhere else just falls short. Japanese Business men even know this is the place to go in AZ...   The Okinawa Soba is a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"I met a friend at Hiro Sushi as part of our Phoenix sushi tour, and it was amazing. We only had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated at the sushi bar. It took me about 45 minutes to get there but was definitely worth the hike. We ordered Omakase to leave the selection to the chef, and everything we were served was on point. The sushi and sashimi were fresh, tender, flavorful, delicious. I think the eel was my favorite. The rice was amazing, perfectly vinegared. The staff and chef were friendly and knowledgeable. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sushi.  You either love it or you, well, don't.  And don't think you love it if what you really like is deep fried cream cheese topped with Siracha.  That is not sushi.  Hiro is Sushi.  The location, in a strip mall on 90th street, is decidedly un-sexy.  We've been three three tims this year and I always see the same things: - Actual Japanese guys working the sushi bar - Actual Japanese people eating there - really fresh fish - Friendly staff  The restaurant has an ols school Japanese bistro feel.  The service is friendly and warm.  The sushi is spectacular.  We had salmos, Hamachi, Unagi, and tuna.  All were fresh, melt in your mouth tender and had the kind of flavor you want your sushi to have.  No tadpoles here.  No cloudy dilm.  Just pure, fresh from the ocean goodness.  They have some nice specialty rolls, and we tried a few.  Prices were reasonable.  Rolls average 8-10 bucks a pop.  Nigiri runs 4-7 bucks a pair.    Now, this is one Japanese place where I wat to try the actual food.  The tempura on the shrimp tempura roll is what other batters aspire to be.  Light, crunchy, not greasy.  Like the thought of batter.  I can only imagine what a plate of it would be like.  well, maybe I won't imagine.  Anyway, highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurants in the valley. The food is fantastic and I go quite often. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that they don't serve liquor/cocktails.  Everything else about this place is 5-star!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Saturday night without reservations and the place was quite busy. Tables seemed to be by reservation only with seating only available at the sushi bar. We were told about 25 minutes wait and were seated in about 20.  Hiro's is rather small and was very busy but we were never rushed out the door. Staff was quite attentive and everyone we encountered was friendly. My wife, who is pregnant had short rib pork soup and seemed to enjoy it greatly. My sister and law and her boyfriend ordered up salmon sashimi and a couple of rolls. I chose the chirashi dinner special.   Overall all the dishes were very good. The rolls looked good, but I couldn't comment on taste. My chirashi was a first for me and it was good, beautifully presented and tasty. I can't speak to pricing as I didn't see the final bill but it was definately good and I'd return when we are back in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Don't understand what all the clammor is about when I was expecting outrageous sushi  and what I got was very mediocre sushi I suppose it was fresh but it didn't taste great and Ive been eating sushi for 30 years! It was very crowded on a weeknight so maybe Im mssing something but I dont think so! Sorry..."}
{"text":"Had dinner the other night. Definitely need to make reservations since the dining area is very small! By 5:30 every seat at sushi bar was taken and only a few tables were open. Service was great. Started with calamari and 2 rolls-salmon skin & crunchy California. Hubby had the udon tempura, son had tempura dinner plate, daughter had the terichicken & chix katsu combo & I had the chix katsu & tempura combo. Everything was delish."}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant in town. Very authentic, very fresh! Wouldn't go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Actually this place reminds me of Japan, the food tastes good but the staffs need to be more friendly, maybe they are too busy. I would recommend to make an appointment before you go there!"}
{"text":"Had chicken katsu and gyota. Every dish was horribly sour tasting."}
{"text":"WoW!     So legit, the real Japanese sushi experience is at Hiro.  Without any special motif or hip Scottsdale decor, it's Japanese and sushi at it's BEST!  Chefs..Japanese, who greeted every person that was walking through the door. It's  pretty small place, like ones found in Japan, and has one of the longest sushi bars I've seen in Arizona.   With daily specials written on the wall including conch (From Florida) in miso to spicy scallop rolls that are sweet and spicy.  The seaweed salad is always a great way to being your meal, Hiro's tempura was crispy and light, and the sushi was very fresh.    It is so hard to find a REAL sushi house and this one that I will be going back again and again!  The service was great all in all from beginning to finish.    We walked in not knowing what to expect, the prices seemed reasonable for sushi and we walked out knowing this hidden gem, is the place to be for sushi !    P.S. First Asian restaurant I've seen in Scottsdale, that I've seen alot of Japanese go to, AWESOME cause I know it must be fresh and good! And it was."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened since the first time we had tried Hiro Sushi. We were in the neighborhood and stopped by for a quick lunch. EJ was not there to our dismay. The waitress that was serving use had a very abrupt manner. We were entertained to try the \"Lunch Special\": Miso Soup, Salad, 3 Handrolls (spicy salmon, salmon skin, spicy tuna) we also added an order of Uni Sushi. I asked the waitress if the sushi chef could make the Handrolls extra spicy and was immediately cut off to say \"no already pre-made. We should have known to cancel the order and go  ala carte. The rolls were just not good, tasted fishy, was a total turn off. To top it off for some reason waitress also crossed out our Uni order as we waited and waited. Maybe it was a bad day, but it will be a while before we go there again."}
{"text":"So as a major sushi fan I had to give this place a try. I am always looking for great sushi with fresh fish and some fun rolls just for kicks. This place was outstanding. I have been twice (once on a weekend and once during the week) and both times the sushi I had was the freshest I've found in the Scottsdale/Phx area in the 27yrs I've lived here. Service was a bit slow both times I was there, but that is easily overlooked as the sushi was so good and the fish was so fresh. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have been going here since they opened and have never been disappointed.,always good service, big smiles from all of the Chefs and the food is delicious every time."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with my Mom, just on a whim. I live right around the corner from here , and since I love sushi, I figured I had to try it.   Plenty of parking. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny. The first thing the person in the front asked us was if we had a reservation. Now that I have been there, I do highly recommend a reservation for the weekends even if it is just two people!   We luckily got seated pretty quick at a table. There are more seats at the sushi bar than tables.  Our server was very sweet and smiled, which I always appreciate.  My mom and I ordered a few rolls and some sashimi. The rolls were decent. I think you can always tell the quality of a place by the sashimi and the sashimi here was WONDERFUL. I would go here in a heartbeat if I was craving some fresh fish.   I always recommend trying tiny, hidden gem places like this !"}
{"text":"We are foodies.  Normally I would say Hiro has the freshest sushi.  I think their quality has went down.  We will not be coming back nor recommending.  There are nicer, cleaner, more fresh places to eat.  When it comes to sushi it has to be fresh."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant in the Valley, hands-down. It's tiny, though, so get there when they open (or make reservations) for a chance at a seat. Better yet, forget this review so I can have Hiro all to myself!"}
{"text":"Wife feel like Japanese and we are in a city we've never been. So she dug around and found this gem. They are not some gigantic over-priced fancy place, but just a friendly little joint that serves good Japanese food. The staff and the chefs are friendly and make customers feel like VIPs. We love the cucumber salad. The acidity is so on point that it is actually sweet. Their fish are fresh, and their rolls, ESPECIALLY the D-Back Roll, are impressive. it has just the right amount of rice and are seasoned just the way it should be. We order the Hamachi Kama, and it was grilled just right. It must have been fresh as they didn't need to down it with salt before grilling, and with a little bit of soy sauce and it tasted perfect. We finished our dinner with deep-fried green tea ice-cream. Now, most places we've been to, we would have ordered a ball of ice-cream rolled in tempura crumbs. That's not the case here. they actually deep fried the ice-cream. Every bite comes with the warmth of the crispy pastry-skin and the coolness of the good green tea ice-cream. LOVED it."}
{"text":"I do not particularly like sushi, however I met friends here tonight. I chose to have the shrimp tempura appetizer and miso soup. Very, very delicious. Most of my friends did have sushi and they all enjoyed their meals. One friend had the fried oyster dinner and she really liked it. A lot of food on her plate!  Another friend actually tried the quail eggs and the octopus!!!  She kind of liked them. I give her an \"A\" for experimenting. I want to bring my daughter and her boyfriend here because they both love sushi."}
{"text":"If you actually like sushi...like not just tempura'd sauce'd American stuff, then you should try this place.  They have the freshest fish that I've had and the atmosphere is top notch.  When you walk in, its like you walked into a little sushi place in Japan.  I love it here and may I suggest the calamari.  It is nothing like you would expect.  I LOVE Hiro and will continue to go there every time I have a sushi craving!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Salmon Nigiri and salmon sashimi flavorful, fresh, and delicious. We also had their special, Diamondback roll, yum. And the baked mussels with special sauce... Let me take a moment of silence.... Yummmmmmm. Good prices too, as we compare to other good sushi places like Nori in mcdowell mtn ranch. Responsive, smiling service. Really liked this place."}
{"text":"This sushi bar was a surprising little find during a trip to Mayo Clinic. It is as authentic as you can get with two Japanese itamae-san preparing beautiful and generous portions of sushi. Looking forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"Months later and still super good. This time I ordered the Nabeyake Udon. Worth every penny. Anything here is totally worth it."}
{"text":"The rolls are quite good.  Sushi and sashimi are pretty good; not terrific.  The staff is very professional.  Our server was very responsive, but I did see other tables waiting a while for their checks.  The food came out at a pretty good pace.  The space is a little cramped."}
{"text":"I'd bookmarked Hiro Sushi forever and finally got to try it out.  I got he chirashi Bowl which was very fresh and pleasing to both the palate and the eye. I watched the chef put together my bowl with extreme precision and care. It was like he was creating a work of art, which is true in a sense!  Hubs got a few rolls which I tried but I liked my bowl better :)  Very traditional Japanese owned and operated restaurant. Definitely recommend reservations, otherwise you might be standing outside for quite a bit."}
{"text":"I came here to have sushi and it came out room temperature when it should have been cold & was not pleasant. Their white rice was mushy. The teriyaki chicken was okay but very salty and the teriyaki sauce tasted like it was soy sauce. The only thing good here was their miso soup. They did have great service as well. But I would not come here again or recommend this place."}
{"text":"My family and I have been regular patrons of this restaurant since before yelp even existed!! The owner, Hiro-san, is the friendliest man ever :)  When I was a little girl he would used to carve me flowers and animals out of carrots in his spare time to keep a bored kid in an adult's dinner party happy and occupied. Now that the restaurant's so successful he has barely any time to make it in and out of the kitchen! But he never fails gives us a huge grin and welcoming wave whenever he sees us.  The staff here is so friendly that when I walk in the doors I always feel at ease.  It's the same feeling as returning home to food and an experience that I KNOW is going to be amazing and satisfying.  Now on to the food...my family and I come to this restaurant AT LEAST once every month.  Since this place is a must-go whenever we have guests visiting, and we've had numerous guests visit us this past month, we have been to HIro's once every week!  Even with all the frequent dining at this restaurant for so many years, we're never tired of it because it is JUST THAT GOOD.  The food is authentic (as I already knew but again confirmed by my visiting friends from Japan) and the quality very fresh.  The following is a list of our favorites:  - miso soup- no explanation necessary :) - spicy tuna roll - catepillar roll- ADORABLE looking and everyone whose had it swears it's delicious.  I believe them but I don't eat eel so I've never tried it. - toro- excellent quality!! - hiyayakko- cold tofu with bonito flakes paired with scallions and ginger.  Pour some soy sauce over it and you have a light, healthy, but tasty appetizer. - nasumiso- miso glazed eggplants. You can't go wrong with this one, trust me. - hamachi kama- yellowtail collar.  The meat is so tender and the sauce they have with it totally makes the dish.  Be sure to squeeze some lemon on it as well! - dynamite- a seafood mix baked in a special sauce.  This is a dish you won't see elsewhere.  It's very rich but also very unique. - halibut carpaccio- raw sliced halibut with sliced scallions and tomatoes.  They pour hot oil over it to half-cook it.  Kind of Italian-Japanese fusion, and very creative! - zaru soba- authentic Japanese soba noodles. Refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day. - green tea ice cream- if you're feeling up to desert, definitely give this a try.  Green tea is my personal favorite and it's actually hard to find good quality ice cream in that flavor!  Their GT ice cream is definitely NOT the cheap gross ones I've unfortunately purchased once at a supermarket...  That should be enough to get you started! There are so many more great dishes I could list but these are the ones we always come back to :)  Branch out and give everything a try! This would be the place to try new things because you can be at ease knowing that anything you order will be of a certain caliber. We tried the sesame roll for the first time yesterday and it was surprising, creative, and delicious.  :)  Hopefully my super long, and way overdue review of this restaurant will convince you to go try it out, or even just try some new dishes!  Now go make your reservation...I promise you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"We had the saikyo yoki, scallops, Houston roll, king crab roll and other items.   All of it was very well prepared and presented.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Hiro!  I've been hearing great things about this place and I finally pulled the plug and dined here.  Let me start by saying if you go during peak dinner hours you'll be waiting a good 30-40 minutes to sit down for a party of 2-3.  They don't have much seating inside, but if you're patient it is worth the wait.  The service was on point from the moment we sat down.  We met Mr. Hiro himself and he actually made our sushi! Very nice guy and very humble.  Everything that we ordered was fresh and delicious.  The oysters, the shishitou peppers, the king crab roll the caterpillar roll & to start a warm bowl of miso soup.  They also have great specials to choose from.  I'm a big sushi fan and this place earns its 5 stars for service, fresh sushi & great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place.  It is very cozy on the inside but all of their staff was very friendly.  For a random weeknight, they were super packed, only one seat was open as we were leaving.    The spicy tuna was awesome and I highly recommend their Sedona Roll.  We also asked our sushi chef (we sat at the sushi bar) to create a special, and he made an awesome tuna and salmon poke bowl.  Everything was really good.  Great atmosphere overall.  Will definitely be back on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Nothing memorable, very plain roll selection. Waited almost 20 minutes to be seated when there were clearly available tables, also overheard a woman in the waiting area with us who had waited over an hour and a half for her togo food when they told her on the phone that it would only take 25 minutes.   Sushi rice was too soft/mushy and all the rolls consist of either eel sauce or shrimp tempura. Not a big variety of rolls and DO NOT GET THE DYNAMITE APPETIZER. it is a waste of $10. It was literally a bowl of baked mayonnaise and tiny scalllops with imitation crab.(crap) Not even anything to dip into the bowl to pick it up with. Were still on the hunt for that WOW sushi in Arizona. It is not here though.  If your looking to \"satisfy\" a sushi craving, this place will work, if your looking to wow your taste buds and your dining experience...keep searching."}
{"text":"Definitely so-so sushi. I'd rather go down the street to Sakana. I probably won't go back.   We had the Volcano Roll and I've had better. Nobody beats Tokyo Lobby's Volcano Roll.   They don't offer happy hour either.  In the words of Yelp, \"Meh, I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"This my favorite sushi bar in the Valley of the Sun.  The fish is fresh and sushi is top notch and prepared by actual Japanese sushi chefs!  My only wish is that the restaurant were bigger as it is almost impossible to get a reservation for 4 people same day even mid-week.  The food never disappoints."}
{"text":"Nice experience enhanced with recommendations from some of their regular customers. I'll come back for more!"}
{"text":"The best spider roll I have had in any sushi place I have ever been in.  Awesome!  If you're into soft-shell crab rolls like I am, you are always looking for the best.  So far... this one tops the list.  Good balance of ingredients and very fresh.  A must try on your next time out."}
{"text":"The best and most authentic sushi place in Scottsdale! The atmosphere is comfortable and not too upscale, the staff are also very friendly and attentive! The quality of their fish is always top notch and majority of the items I have tried have been to my liking. There were probably only one or two things that didn't suit my tastes but that's understandable since everyone has different tastes.   Some of my favorite dishes here include the calamari, salmon skin rolls, unaju, chicken udon, and the tempura ice cream!"}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi I have tasted in awhile. They make some homegrown originals that are the f__king bomb. Try the Arizona Roll that comes with their miso sauce, it's worthy of a death row last meal request. Also the Dynamite Scallops appetizer will blow you away. Service is above average. Only drawback ? they're kicking you out of there at 10 pm on a Friday night, hence the fall to 4 stars...."}
{"text":"Great food but beer is too warm and lights are way too bright. I feel like I'm being interrogated. I would give the food 4 1/2 stars but the ambience just ruins it."}
{"text":"I found Hiro Sushi to be excellent. The quality of the fish used was high, and the service was good. I enjoyed the sunomono (cucumber salad) and their mango ice-cream dessert was very good. The Hamachi (yellowtail) was very good, and the portions were generous. The rolls did fall apart a little and could have been packed tithgter but the overall quality was terrific and the price was good."}
{"text":"We eat sushi about 3 times a week- what Im shocked about is, we have only just found Hiro Sushi. It has jumped to our favourite sushi restaurant. The fish was extremely fresh and delicious and not overpriced. A plus, the staff and service are excellent.  A MUST GO if you are looking for top notch sushi in N. Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This was a great find.  We were looking in north Scottsdale for a sushi place that wasn't super high-end, but every place we saw was only 3.5 stars (I need higher than that to go for sushi).    Based on the Yelp reviews, we decided to take the 10 minute dive to Hiro.  Man, are we glad we did!  It's a little hole-in-the wall place in a strip mall that only seats 42 (according to the max occupancy sign) and has the glass on the front door that obscures light, so we didn't even know if it was open.  When we walked in, the tiny waiting area was packed, and we felt like we found a 'hidden gem'.  We got there at 7:30 on a Saturday night and there was about a  1/2 hour wait -- but worth it.    Super-fresh fish.  Many of their daily specials are simply based on what they found that looked good at the fish market that morning.  Pricing was actually a little less than we are used to paying in Our 'go to' spot in Vegas.  Regular rolls around $9-10 and specials rolls around $14-15.  Definitely will return when back in town!"}
{"text":"It's OK but certainly not great.  We stopped by on a Saturday night around 8.  It was busy and we sat at the sushi bar.  We ordered a couple of rolls and a half dozen nigiri sushi and everything was alright but nothing beyond that.  The atmosphere is old-school neighborhood Japanese like you used to find in LA's Japanese neighborhoods 20 years ago.  Unpretentious and slightly divey.  Service was friendly and efficient from the waitresses.  The sushi chef never made eye contact or spoke to us even though we were sitting right in front of his workspace for 45 minutes.  Our platter had perhaps 3 pieces of ginger so I asked the sushi chef for more ginger.  I got maybe another tablespoon of ginger - without a word.  Annoying. The sushi was decently made but nothing terribly special.  The rice was a bit loose/wet, the fish quality was very average, with the exception of the hamachi, which was quite good. The fish portions were also a bit small. When we were there,  they were out of uni.   I would stop by if I was in the neighborhood and in the mood for sushi but I wouldn't drive across town for it.  Our bill was $60.00 for two with tip for a moderate amount of sushi, a sake and a beer.  As several other Yelpers have observed, the plethora of 5 star reviews for this joint are baffling to me.  My response would have to be \"huh?\"  I've been eating sushi for 30 years, been to Japan many times and I know what great sushi is and this isn't even close.  The sushi chef seemed to be mainly making the very non-Japanese rolls (cream cheese, etc.) that are so popular throughout the Valley.  If this is \"the best sushi in the Valley\" then people in the valley have set the bar a bit too low or else they've never had really good sushi."}
{"text":"AWESOME!  My husband and I lived in Tokyo for a few years, so our standards for sushi are rather high. We tried this place for the first time and immediately stepping in the door, I knew it would be good. From the welcoming \"irashai!\" from the sushi chefs, to the sound of Japanese banter from behind the sushi bar, and the Japanese customers, this is the real deal. The sushi was fabulous, with many exotic options that are just not found in very many places in Arizona. The sushi and rolls were fresh, pretty, and delicious. This is the best sushi I've eaten in Arizona and we'll be frequenting this neighborhood sushi bar often. I highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a Japanese Restaurant in this area and finally found one that our whole family likes. We had the caterpillar and eel and Cucumber rolls. They were really good. They make the caterpillar in the shape of a caterpillar with a caterpillar head. Very cool and creative but even better is the taste.  i had the Teriyaki chicken, my wife had the Teriyaki Chicken and tempura and my daughter had the chicken katsu and tempura. The dinners comes with salad and miso soup. The salad had a salty dressing but the soup was very good. The chicken teriyaki was all white meat and was a little dry but very good. The chicken katsu very good. I tried the tempura and this was very fresh and really good.  I would say to stick with the sushi and tempura. It's the best.  Overall I would say the place is very small and the service was pretty good. Next time we have a sushi craving we'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Hiro Sushi since they opened in the 1990's.  It never fails.  Still one of the top ten Sushi restaurants in the Valley, per the food critics.  As a loyal customer, thank you for years of consistent quality and wonderful service."}
{"text":"We really enjoy sushi and since relocating to AZ have been trying to find \"our\" place. Search is over. Sushi here is reasonably priced, delicious and taste very fresh (which is key). I luv's me some sushi and this place hits the sushi spot. Due to busy schedules we have only done takeout here and I never order ahead, I order when I get there. However service is pretty fast for takeout and each time we go the place is packed which is a good sign. Will definitely go and actually sit and take in the environment one of these days."}
{"text":"I ordered the unagi and crazy roll and both were great- although the crazy roll was a bit too big to fit in one bite."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town hands down! I am a sushi guru and have been all over.  My dad has worked for a Japanese company all my life. When his clients come into town from Japan this is the only sushi place he'll take them because it's the best in town.   It is a small intimate place that has become a daddy daughter tradition. Him and I get together around Christmas time and splurge ourselves full of sushi and saki. We finish off with green tea ice cream, my absolute fav!!!  Love it, love it, love it! Can't say enough great things about Hiro!!!"}
{"text":"The review is not about food. We love their quality sushi rolls. Unfortunately tonight they failed at customer service. I called to make reservations for Friday night for party of 12 and was told they can not accomodate more than 10!!! They can take reservation for 2 tables/6 people each table...Well, its my birthday and obviously I want everyone to sit together and not at 2 separate tables. I understand that it is a small place but I have never heard someone restricting a number of people for a reservation. We are extremely disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"-Exquisite Sushi-  You know a sushi place is going to be legit when they serve items like maguro (bluefin), sake (salmon), and otoro but Sushi Hiro goes beyond the scope of what most sushi places in Phoenix serve by offering an array of hard to find goodies. Items like Hirame Engawa (Halibut Muscle), Uni (Sea Urchin), and Amberjack are all on offer here. More importantly is that they treat their dishes right as each nigiri comes with the appropriate brush of glaze like the Anago with its sweet soy based glaze.   The all Japanese chef team here have noticeable especially when you watch their knifework and sushi crafting. No sloppy cuts of fish or clumpy rice here and you can clearly see their talent and deftness with their tools.  Their nigiri and sashimi is excellent but I was pleased to see that they do the traditional fusion dishes that Chinese and Korean sushi owned joints excel at. Caterpillar roll came in at $13 and was topped with loads of avocado and unagi. More impressive was how thinly the chef was able to slice the avocado onto the roll. It seems minor but it changed the texture of the dish and made the avocados one of the best I've had topped on a roll.  Overall, I think Sushi Hiro is one of if not the best sushi places in Phoenix and able to compete with the more established sushi destinations on the West Coast. You simply can't find quality, value, and menu diversity elsewhere in Phoenix.   Having Asahi on Draft is icing on the cake.~"}
{"text":"I'm in town for business and looked for yelpers to guide me the way and I was led to the right spot. It's tiny and in a small strip mall. I would've driven past it if it weren't for the great reviews. I had the sushi dinner and it was fresh and tasty. The service was excellent and welcoming. The sushi chef was a cutie too. What more can a girl ask for when she is forced to eat alone!"}
{"text":"We love this place! 2 years in a row (annual trip to Phoenix) and the quality and service is fantastic. Love that we were able to make reservations. Sushi quality is excellent - especially the salmon and blue fin tuna.  I think the shrimp tempura roll could use a little help - awkwardly big and too many cucumbers.  The sesame roll (soft shell) was a bit greasy but still tasty.  Our server was so nice.  See you next February!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today with a friend as I was craving sushi  and this place is always spot on. I arrived at 5pm to a line already at the front door, but we were able to sit at the bar no problem. We were not acknowledged by our chef. In fact he ignored us the entire time. I am not sure when he prepared my rolls as I did not see him do it. He handed me a plate with very small rolls the kind you see at Chinese buffets. My first thought was wow the quality here has changed in the past year until another couple sat next to me and were acknowledged right away. This couple also ordered two of the same rolls that I too ordered and there's were substantially larger. Now I know from being a sushi fan for a number of years that if you get in good with your chef they will sometimes hook you up with larger portions, free samples, etc. but they were not chums of his. In a nut shell, I felt slighted going to Hiro Sushi today. The food remains good and of substantial quality but I will not return. I will take my money to Shimogamo in Chandler where both the food and customer service rocks!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Hiro Sushi because of the  reviews as it is very difficult to find a good sushi restaurant in the valley.  With my husband being half Japanese, lived in Japan & just having visited Tokyo last May for 2 weeks - it takes a lot to win over our palates.    First, this not your typical modern sushi restaurant which translates to social meeting place/lounge for people that want mega rolls with different condiments splattered all over them. They have some, but  if that is what you think sushi is - head to Sapporo or RA.  Second, nothing against non-Japanese sushi chefs as they can be quite talented - but something about having Japanese sushi chefs creating your food that brings some authenticity to the whole experience.  Third, the fish was fresh and was served in good portions.  Its not about bigger is better - quality is what you pay for when it comes to sashimi or nigiri.  Looked over the entree menu - typical mix of tempura, teriyaki & katsu dishes - nothing real special.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love their sushi - that's 5 stars. I hate, hate, hate their customer service. That one gets 1 star, so I guess 3 stars is where they land.  After waiting on the phone for 10 minutes to place an order and they got it wrong after I waited there to pick it up for 15, I give up - I will not go there again. They didn't even try to make it right after wasting my time. Plenty of good sushi in other places..."}
{"text":"I've not had a bad sushi role yet. I also get the Okinwan soba bowl which is quite tasty. Don't forget to go early on the weekends, they are packed. Food is expensive, but most well run sushi places are ;)"}
{"text":"Hiro Sushi is amazing and if you're in the East valley or on the East side of Scottsdale you've got to try it.  We we're introduced by friends of our who are living in North Scottsdale and were blown away by the food. A little hole in the wall owned, managed and run by a Japanese family originally from Okinawa...  We sat at the bar and noticed all the fresh fish that is flown in daily. The eel was superb along with the yellowtail and speciality rolls.  We will be going back when we are on that side of town!"}
{"text":"I found a new sushi place, and no one has even yelped it yet!  I'm not surprised, it's not in a location that really jumps out at you or catches your eye as you're driving along.  It's in a strip mall of course and the building looks really plain from the outside.  But when you go in, you'll find a cute sushi place that has pretty good food.   They have creative sushi rolls in colored soybean paper (pink, yellow and blue)- I've never seen that before.  And although I'm not very daring when it comes to sushi, I did try a few different ones.  I liked the Jazz roll, which had shrimp, asparagus and some other things, and I thought that one was delish.  I thought the Crazy roll was just okay, and that one has spicy tuna, avocado, fried shrimp and something else in it.  The Arizona roll was pretty tasty too, it has asparagus, cucumber and scallops.    If you like sushi, you should definitely give this place a try.  It's always fun to try somewhere new and the prices are on par with other sushi restaurants I've been to. Just don't rake me over the coals if you go and decide this is the worst sushi ever.  Remember, I'm not a sushi connoisseur!"}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese place in Phoenix --- the only actually authentic place that I've been to here!   The sushi and fish quality was the best for around here. Even their tamago was the quality one.   I ordered ahi (7/10), salmon (8/10) & tamago (10/10) nigiri, and a tempura & pork katsu dinner (8.5/10). We also ordered gyoza (10/10 - homemade!!! but only 4 pieces) and fried red bean/azuki ice cream (10/10).  This is definitely my new favorite place in Arizona!!! I've been dying to find an actually GOOD/true Japanese place and this definitely delivered! Will be returning very soon!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by again for sushi...actually the best sushi in the valley...by far...really no competition...you have to try here to see the difference...started with Kara Taiba sake...rich full flavored and crispy...amazing!! Had the fried eggplant (eat with rice, sauce is strong) and shrimp tempura appetizer...wow amazing!!! Then had salmon sashimi which is insanely fresh followed by sea bream, albacore, uni, surf clam, but they were out jumbo clam tonight. Perfect dinner as always...there is a reason I genuinely think this is top 5 sushi place in the US...from New York to Chicago to LA..."}
{"text":"Incredible, fresh toro sashimi and rainbow roll but outrageous albacore tataki! Reasonable prices, fun time at sushi bar, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Mr Hiro you got a review of the day with a little help from Michelle M of course.  I am no expert here. I have however known Mr Hiro for many years and right from the start loved how the chefs took extra care when making food and how I would feel in his small restaurant with all the style.  I remember my first visit with my friend, a sushi maniac so many years ago. I hardly understood the food at all. We ate crisp shrimp heads. I hardly believed this was food.  Anyway I have grown to love sushi and sitting at the bar. It's more than just a food, sushi is an art form enjoyed for its taste as well as presentation.   Hiro Sushi, better than a single slab of o-toro tuna."}
{"text":"Hiro sushi is an unbelievable hidden gem, family owned and operated, top notch sushi quality!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed by the salmon nigiri. The salmon was plump, soft, and tasty. The soft fresh tofu was delightfully cool and light. Do add the ginger and onions a atop if the lightness is to bland for you. The crazy roll was decent and basic. No mayo or sauce or extra flavoring added. I didn't try their fancier rolls because it costs like $15.95 or $14.95...which i think is over the top for one roll...  I'd come here again but only if i was in the neighborhood..."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! I placed a to go order and arrived when I was supposed to then waited for 15 mins in a small crowed waiting area just to pick up my order. They really need more help at the front during peak dinner hours. I will not be back"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Hiro Sushi by a good friend. The food is always delicious and the service is impeccable - whether you choose to sit at a table, belly up to the sushi bar or bring your order home. Everyone has a terrific attitude and the food is always extremely fresh. In a word: outstanding!"}
{"text":"I wish there were 10 stars available for this place.  I started coming here about 10 years ago with the office crowd and I had never tried sushi before.  Now I am a firm fan of this small neighborhood place.  I have now tried sushi in many different restaurants in different cities and countries, but they don't stack up against this place.  I love their spicy octopus, stuffy crunchy shrimp (a house special) and their tempura is light and tasty.  They also offer an out if this world eggplant miso which I would gladly drink pints of that sauce it is so good!  I am also a big fan of their Okinawa soup, a meal in the bowl with soba noodles, broth, slices of fish cake, shredded ginger and spring onion - a real treat.  They offer a chirashi dish which is served in a lacquered box and consists of a bed of rice with slices of fresh sashimi which is always good.  If I don't have that then we have fun with the maki / sashimi menu options ordering their excellent spicy tuna (they roll it in sesame seeds which really make it pop), tuna tempura sashimi (which comes with that wonderful miso sauce), their spicy ribbon roll is good and we love their scallop maki as well as their flying fish eggs, spicy salmon and yellow tail.     If you do want to eat here at night you should consider booking a table or waiting till a seat at the counter opens up.  If you don't mind the counter, sitting there is where you get to witness the wonderful knife skills of the friendly chefs, some of which are the sons on the owner Hiro.    I love this place, hope you do too, enjoy........."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rounded up to 4.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Uni, Toro, Spicy Ribbon Roll, Chirashi, and Udon noodles. We always get an order of Uni and Toro whenever we get sushi nowadays, so its become sort of our starting indicator as to how the restaurant ranks to others. I'm so sad to say that I was disappointed with both the Uni and Toro-- both cut into thin slices on their relatively large beds of rice. The Chirashi was slightly better although I must warn you that its not much fish. I loved the thick slices of tuna and salmon, but was personally not a fan of the other items (squid, octopus, fish eggs). Overall, solid quality but left thinking, \"That's it?\"  Both the Spicy Ribbon Roll and the Udon noodles were superb. I'm a huge fan of salmon and my boyfriend loves spicy tuna, so the Spicy Ribbon Roll was absolutely perfect for us. The Udon noodles' soup was flavorful and the exact type of bowl you'd crave on a cold, rainy day."}
{"text":"It's like the Meatloaf song, \"4 outta 5 ain't bad\"  I can't seem to give the 5th start to Phoenix Sushi places, it's like I am blocked by the God of Shashimi. Don't get me wrong this place is great they have a wide variety, friendly and quick staff, and it is really off the beaten path. It is pretty small and quaint, ( I actually had a debate with a person I went with here, can something be both small and quaint?) Either way, it's nice inside, you get a cozy sushi feeling. The Miso soup is great, and the shashimi is fresh, and cut into big pieces. The prices are OK,  the down side, no happy hour of any kind.  It is a small place, so I can see why they don't have a happy hour. I highly recommend this place to all sushi lovers, you won't be disappointed. It's very clean and inviting.  In the terms of atmosphere, I was tempted to get hammered off saki here, (though I only had 1 Sapporo)  it's that type of place that you want to do shots of Saki with the sushi chef's and pass out on a plate of ahi tuna, to awaken with a tattoo on your arm that says \"Konichiwa Bitches\" and has a picture of Morimoto the Iron Chef from Japan, it's that quaint ;)."}
{"text":"Hiro is one of the best sushi restaurants in Arizona. I eat at Hiro at least once a week and have been doing so for over a year. Their fish is always fresh. One of my favorite things about Hiro is that their sushi speaks for it's self. There are not a lot of sweet sauces, mayo and fillers that poor quality restaurants use to mask their fish.  In addition to the food, the staff are great. Masa, Take, and Leo (just to name a few) are great chefs who are also very personable and funny. We enjoy sitting at the bar as talking with the chefs and watching them masterfully prepare food. You have got to give Hiro sushi a try."}
{"text":"This was by far the best sushi place in the Valley. We were very happy and satisfied with every single thing we ate. Sashimi slices were thick and good portion. Unlike other sushi place where nigiri sushi rice is huge and dry, Hiro Sushi had perfect texture and size. Uni, aji, mirugai and toro were amazing. They even had pickled ume flavored seaweed. My only problem is that place is not closer to Chandler."}
{"text":"Sushi was amazing good. It was more simple than what we have had but it had great flavor. Price was very reasonable and the quality of sushi was great. Just wish they had a bigger selection of drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing. Just became my new favorite sushi spot. Everything we had was so fresh and prepared amazingly. I had the rainbow roll and sushi dinner. I cant wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"AWESOME, AWESOME Sushi! By far the best sushi in AZ. I've been traveling to Arizona for business for 3 years now and so glad I finally found this place. Everything about this place is great. Service is great and Sushi is extremely fresh. Defiantly give it a try if your on the search for good Sushi in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese Service is great: quick and friendly! I have been here a few times and the fish always tastes very fresh especially for being a sushi place in the valley.   I always enjoy getting a seat at the sushi bar so I can talk it up with the chef. for the adventurous: Ask the chef to make you their own specialty dish, my taste buds have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great sushi one of the best in Scottsdale. The place is small so get a reservation. If you are looking for a good authentic sushi place. This is the place to go."}
{"text":"Best sushi in AZ in terms of authenticity and quality.  I appreciate their focus on sashimi and nigiri instead of having a menu full of specialty rolls.  My wife and I always get some uni and Toro here.  Our kids love the chicken katsu and miso soup."}
{"text":"Great old school sushi bar feel. Very fresh, we lived the Houston role  Service was good and price was fair"}
{"text":"Found Hiro Sushi from great reviews on yelp. Was able to be seated immediately for lunch on a Wednesday. Party of 4, staff was very friendly and cordial, ordered drinks, no liquor available- just beer and water wine, no big deal. Edamame to start, spicy tuna rolls, spicy salmon rolls, California roll with real crab ordered. Spicy Tuna Don and tempura shrimp roll. All was quite good, miso soup and salad tasty, quick turn for sushi and other dishes. Spicy Tuna roll was rough chopped pieces of tuna not macerated style (we prefer the rough chopped pieces). Quaint old school atmosphere, mild fish smell, but not over powering like some established facilities of similar age. Not for the person seeking the trendy approach. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The Jazz roll was delicious! This is great sushi and you don't have to pay for a fancy atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Hiro is my favorite sushi restaurant in the Phoenix area. The quality of the toro was very good. The salmon was buttery and quite tasty as well."}
{"text":"Most authentic Japanese food in Arizona. Service is 5/5 food is 5/5. Freshest fish, high quality ingredients. Great prices. I've spent quiet a bit of time in Japan and this is honestly the best Japanese food I've had since then. A+"}
{"text":"Another Yelp-led awesomeness. When I searched for restaurants in Scottsdale and came upon Hiro Sushi, I was a bit skeptical. It definitely did not seem like it could be a 5-star restaurant, but I am wrong.  First of all, the ambiance of the place is a lot nicer than the pics that are shown here on Yelp. They have a very long sushi bar with chefs chatting it up with you, and then there is also lots of dining areas. Light jazzy music is played softly and the lights are dim.  I ordered the crazy roll ($9), with spicy salmon, tempura shrimp, avocado, cucumbers wrapped in a pink soy. Their spicy sauce is so good and their tempura is very crunchy and tasty.  I also had the Volcano ($10), which had clams, enoki mushrooms, regular mushrooms, mayonnaise, baked. The dish was super creamy and meant to be shared. I kinda regret eating it all by myself since it must be super fatty, yet i enjoyed every bite of it.  All this was accompanied by a large glass of plum wine for only $6.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and tried it out last night. It is so great! Delicious sushi, beautiful restaurant and great service. We sat at the sushi bar and had a fun time."}
{"text":"In from Denver and our first visit.  Great service at the sushi bar, tremendous quality in fish and and very tasty."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 50 stars! I went here for my 11th b-day. The food was great! We ate a ton! I had a spicy salmon roll, octopus nigiri, spicy scallop roll, sea urchin nigiri, Houston roll, eel nigiri. But the most amazing part was dessert. I ordered chocolate  mochi. When they came out the lights dimmed, and then they were singing. They must have heard me talk about my brithday because they sang happy birthday to me! I was so touched by the generosity. Plus the mochi was amazing. I would go back anytime! No fake wasabi or anything. They even speak Japanese unlike many places which feel very phony.  Domo arigato Hiro Sushi!"}
{"text":"This is what willis was talking about!  I tried to find decent sushi in the Scottsdale area and i failed again and again until I hit up Hiro last night.   Great place! Good Sake selection, delicious hamachi kama and the freshest sashimi that i've found in the area. You are getting what you are paying for here.  We tried almost all the sashimi available here including the toro and ankimo and everything was pretty good. For some reason, the american sushi chef guy put the hirame to swim in ponzu sauce which upset me a little. but i will let this slide. Will probably have to pass on the toro next time too.  Try the hamachi kama if they have it available!  My coworkers and I will be back here soon. very soon."}
{"text":"We have been going to this wonderful Japanese Resaurant for years.  The food, all of it, is great and the sushi is always fresh and delicious.  The employees greet you when you arrive and thank you when you leave.   They have a lunch menu that runs from $7.50 to $10.99 and it is all great and there is plenty to fill you.    If you enjoy Sushi and Japanese food this is the place to go and the price is very good."}
{"text":"Busy always = Fresh fish!  Some not so usual varieties so there are things to try.  These guys work hard and it shows.  We spent two weeks in AZ and ate here twice in one week."}
{"text":"Hands down--best sushi I've had in Arizona. The tuna sashimi tempura was amazing. The flavors and textures were simply amazing. Top 5 sushi rolls ever.  The sashimi tasted like the sea and was very tender. We had the toro = also amazing.   Sit at the bar for quick service with the occasional joke from the chef."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in the area. I just moved here a couple months ago and have been dying to find quality sushi. Hiro Sushi is a small hidden gem that's just off 101 & 90th Street. Although the restaurant is a little small, there's always free/open seating at the sushi bar. That's where I usually sit anyway. The sushi chefs are knowledgable and very passionate.   The salmon sashimi was really fresh and generously cut. I also ordered the monk fish pate - served steamed with miso or ponzu sauce. If you're feeling adventurous, just ask the chef to surprise you with a roll! I was surprised with the tuna tempura sashimi roll and it was fabulous! Not really a fan of tempura rolls but it was very light!   Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is excellent. The chefs and staffs are very friendly. I'm glad I found this place. Thanks Yelp!!!"}
{"text":"After a long afternoon lying by the pool, hungry, looking for happy hour deals, we found Hiro Sushi in N. Scottsdale.  No happy hour here, but they offer high quality Japanese food at an affordable price. My favorite was the tempura dish. It was perfectly fried and so crispy.  You can taste that they used clean oil to fry, not like other restaurants.  The sushi rolls were very fresh and well prepared. This is my new favorite Japanese restaurant in N. Scottsdale."}
{"text":"So glad we tried this place! Hiro Sushi is the best place we've tried so far.  The pair to sapporo and nearest sushi, this is by far hands down much better! Their prices are better.  They have a larger selection of sushi. This issue was so fresh!  They  truly are an authentic sushi place. You know this when the chefs are Japanese!!  :)   The service was excellent! It took awhile to get our order but it was because it was packed!  So be patient.   Yelp doesn't allow you to give half points. Otherwise I would give a 4.5 rating only because it's nearly impossible to get through to them on the phone. I tried calling 7 times for 10 minutes and just kept getting a busy signal."}
{"text":"You're transported to that little restaurant around the corner from the train station in Doko-demo, Japan - the Japanese version of Cheers - where everyone knows you like sushi and eating the simple, good things. We loved the crab sunumono, agedashi tofu, calamari, fried smelts and gyozo to start, and then fresh sushi - in the desert - was wonderful - especially the uni. I had heard about this place for 2 years and finally went - and it became of our best new discoveries in the past year. Hiro Sushi is not fancy, but it's good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Some of the best Sushi and service I've had in a long time.  Sushi Chefs were quick and prompt with making the rolls and very lively and fun to watch.  Never had to wait for a thing, wait staff was discreetly working in the background, don't think my water glass ever got below 1/2 before it was filled back up.  Will be back, exceptional!"}
{"text":"For me personally, Hiro's is in that rare category of restaurants that is so good that (out of pure selfishness) I almost don't want to leave a review or tell people about it because I want it all to myself. However, after nearly a decade of patronage, anytime I'm asked about my favorite restaurant, where good sushi is, or where to find good fish in general... There is only one answer Hiro's Sushi. If the fact that even though they open for dinner at 5:00pm, My dad and I get there at 4:30 (so we can sit in front of Hiro at the sushi bar) and still have people already in line. Any regular will tell you that on Friday and Saturday nights they open at 5:00 and by 5:05 they're on a 45 minute to and hour wait. What more do you need to see? If that isn't proof you're in the right place for an incredible meal I don't know what is. What's nice about Hiro's (aside from the level of high quality ingredients, skill in preparation and sincere hospitality) is that whether you're getting your first California roll or your idea of desert is Uni or Quail egg and roe you will be taken care of. All you need to do is let them know what you like what you don't like and they will suggest a few things to lead you in the right direction. However, if you'd rather have the full experience and you don't mind spending a pretty penny... The best way to enjoy an evening at Hiro's is to sit at the far end of the sushi bar in front of Hiro and say \"Chef I'm in your hands tonight, if you would choose what I have I would be extremely grateful.\" It's truly the best way to experience this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. Every time I call they are often booked up. Turns out it's a pretty small restaurant. Sushi was tasty, and fresh. Service was wonderful, very attentive. Salads were all delicious.  This might be my new go-to sushi place."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's fair to review a fish place that's located in the middle of the desert.  Especially when my main gripe is that the fish was not fresh and tasted frozen and thawed. Is it fair? Maybe not. Still wasn't good. It was edible, but not \"oh this is tasty.\" We also received two rolls that neither of us remembered ordering. I'm not saying that they were added to our bill on purpose, I'm just saying i hate salmon skin rolls and if somebody tells me that I ordered a salmon skin roll, that's suspicious to me."}
{"text":"Hiro sushi is hands down one of the best places in Arizona to get sashimi and sushi of high quality. Their fish is always fresh and cut well. They are the only sushi place I've ever been able to order jellyfish, which is excellent. Their toro is amazing. They also have less expensive sashimi lunch specials which are great quick options if you're not looking to spend more on a full sushi or sashimi meal. They also serve one of the best sunomono salads I've ever had. I also recommend trying the sautéed mushrooms as well.   Atmosphere - Cozy and dim lit, the sushi bar dominates the space in the best way. Small tables fill the rest of the restaurant and a small waiting area as you walk in with a wall filled with celebrity photos. Their staff is incredibly friendly and attentive. This is my go to spot for sushi any time day or night. It is an environment that allows you to be a bit more casual which I like."}
{"text":"This past weekend I had one goal. That goal was to find the best sushi joint in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and thanks to a great suggestion of a co-worker I found it. Then I Yelped it and I drove about 20 minutes and had one of the best sushi meals of my life. I spent about 60$ and it was worth every single freak'n penny. The sushi chef, Masa, was one of the kindest and coolest people I've met. Also, according to Masa, all of the sushi they serve is 100% fresh. They don't use the vacuum packed and frozen fish ever. I fell in love."}
{"text":"Sushi was good. Udon was disappointing to say the least. My girlfriend got the chicken teriyaki and the chicken was dry and tasteless. Only reason for the second star was the atmosphere. Worst $50 I have ever spent."}
{"text":"Great,  but pricy,  place for sushi.  Kitchen  dishes leave a lot to be desired.   Sushi quality and quantity is very good here and I believe has always been. I have been dining here for over 10 years. Unfortunately, one of my favorite dishes (oyakodon)  is just not good anymore. I won't be ordering again.  The chicken  is totally overcooked and rubbery, inedible. It's very obvious that the chicken is precooked then added to the dish while cooking. That is NOT how oyakodon is supposed to be cooked.  How do I know, you ask?  I worked in a real Japanese restaurant and I know how the dish is properly prepared. I have also been to Japan numerous times. Un acceptable rubber chicken makes the dish not enjoyable.  Meat is to be cooked in the broth."}
{"text":"They might have good sushis to get this many good reviews, but my goodness, just came out of this place and I feel I am going to have to throw up the food I just ate to get rid of the salt intake! I order a $13 udon soup. It is so so salty that it hurts my lips. I was hungry and didn't want to waste my money so I tried to eat as much I could stand. Now, I regretted it. Hopefully, my blood pressure doesn't go up too much and I won't have sore throat tomorrow. The first time and the LAST time!!"}
{"text":"Saturday was a busy, busy day!  There were so many moving parts to my day:  * I rode my mountain bike to Tempe to see the Tour de Fat:)  * I had to play Squash at the club:)  * I had football on the TiVo that really needed my attention:)  * Oh yeah, Carin had a pretty big photo shoot that she was managing, and she asked me to help her with \"model wrangling\" for a little while...(she didn't call it that...she's far more refined than I am...she asked me to help sign people in and make sure they got where they needed to be...but I call it \"model wrangling\":-)  Where do I get the energy? :)  After a busy day, it was time for a dinner party with the photographer, the owners of the business, and selected guests from the shoot...interesting people and a wonderful mix for great conversation...which makes for a great dinner party:)  Hiro Sushi had been selected for the party and they did not disappoint:)  Hiro San has been a sushi master since 1968 and knows his way around a sushi bar (as do all of his assistant chefs:)  Hiro likes his boats, and all the sushi, sashimi and rolls were delivered to the table in traditional sushi boats...that's presenting your fish old school...and I approve (I have too...I went to an old school...back in olden days:)  Fresh tasting and delicious, the food came in waves ebi, maguro, iki, ikura, uni and anago, along with Arizona Roll (vegetarian...not my favorite), Caterpillar Roll and Spider Roll while we all enjoyed Kirin and hot and cold sake:-)  Hiro doesn't really have a party room, but they created a nice little spot for us all and we all laughed and talked and drank and ate and it was just a wonderful night.  We've been to Hiro before and the food and service are always top notch:)  The ambience in the restaurant is a little bit pedestrian...it kind of feels to me like a strip mall sushi bar (which it is, although the food is an order of magnitude better than most strip mall sushi:)  And creativity isn't really Hiro's strong suit...good and fresh sushi always, but not always presented as art.  Does that make a difference?...I don't know for sure...it can be an important part of the equation for me:)  That said, I like Hiro's...a lot:)  A lot better than I like model wrangling...it's really not my cup of dirty chai latte....it was like herding cats...pretty, pretty cats:)"}
{"text":"Really good quality sushi!  It's busy on Friday nights, but they take reservations.  Great tamago.  Their hamachi sashimi was incredible!  Some of the best I've ever eaten.  Very good customer service.  The atmosphere is nice, not trendy.  It gets pretty loud when they are busy, but it's definitely a great place to get excellent sushi!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the diametric opposite of Sopporro or Pearl, come to the light side. Enter Hiro.    It's void of a club scene, the quality of the food is stellar, and while it's not cheap, it's justifiable. Their udon, sashimi, salads, and rolls are all delicious, fresh, and expertly prepared. This is the place where my friends from Japan go to eat when they want Japanese food... that's right, no cougars or scenesters. Mostly Asians (always a great sign at sushi place), couples, and families. Oh, and their green tea is fantastic, as is their sake selection.  Hiro really knows its stuff when it comes to Japanese food, especially when compared to the other options in Scottsdale. I'd give them 5 stars, but the prices and total lack of atmosphere renders me a standard fan, not quite a cult follower."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we decided to try Hiro Sushi! For the past few years I've been very disappointed in Phoenix-area sushi restaurants. Hiro isn't just good for the area; it compares well to restaurants in other cities, too.  Hiro is a small, quiet restaurant done up in dark, sophisticated colors. Even when the restaurant was full, the atmosphere was relaxing. There were a few families there, but it would still be a good place for a date.   I'm incredibly picky about the freshness of fish, most of all when I'm eating it raw, and I've passed this on to my family. If you feel the same way, you'll be happy to learn that none of us had any complaints in this area.  Hiro's portions are large, which is great if you love shashimi. In fact, my favorite item was the salmon sashimi. Hiro had some truly beautiful salmon last night, and it tasted even better than it looked! The tuna sashimi was also served generously and it was very good.   The nigiri items we ordered were ikura (salmon eggs), ika (squid), suzuki (bass) and unagi (eel.) The suzuki is usually prepared with ponzu (a cirtus vinegar) but you can get it without. Unagi is usually barbequed, but they offered it to my husband in two different ways. I can't remember what the other way was, but he ordered the barbequed, and he and my daughter said it was delicious. (I could taste that one because it wasn't gluten-free; same with the ikura, which my daughter, the ikura fan, said were good.) I'm the squid fan, and since you see I've given Hiro five stars, you know I enjoyed their squid!  I'd like to make special note about the edamame. At most restaurants this popular appetizer is treated with the same care as the free chips you get at a cheap Mexican joint. There's a lot of overcooked edamame in this town! At Hiro, ALL of the edamame in our three large bowls were bright and crispy. You didn't see salt on the outside of the pods, but they must have seasoned them in some way, because the peas inside were mildly salty and seemed to have some other flavors, too.   Hiro takes reservations, and on the weekends you should make one. We went early on a Saturday (6pm) and wanted to sit at the sushi bar, so we were okay, but all the tables were already reserved, and within a half hour of our arrival all the tables were filled, and the sushi bar, too.  We'll definitely be back!  UPDATE JULY 2015: We HAVE been back to Hiro Sushi, and it's always been great."}
{"text":"Came to this place based off recommendations from coworkers and creeping on a local (Phoenix) friends yelp page. I was lookin' for sushi! But in the Wild West? Doubtful I'll find any worth writing about...   WRONG!   Walked in and it's packed! Good sign, as there's another all you can eat sushi place within walking distance. So obviously this place is worth it. But what's this? A minimum of 40 minute wait? Dude, I'm hungry and again, expectations are low. Fresh fish prepared properly in the middle of the desert? Yea right.... again: WRONG!  Sit down at the bar, and a delightful woman attends to me.... speaks Japanese, is Japanese. But what's this? Get to talking and come to find out, she's from Okinawa!!! Itoman to be exact. Those of y'all that know me know I lived in Okinawa for 6 yrs. And I'm very familiar with her hometown. Then she turns to the gentlemen that is referred to as ??, the main and obviously head sushi chef, and tells him hey this guys from Okinawa! Well go figure, he's her husband, and guess where she's from? Yea. So not only does this Japanese restaurant have actual Japanese people preparing the dishes, but they are fellow islanders, what a cool surprise. And I'm not being prejudice or anything, but don't you get excited when you walk into an Italian joint and find that it's actually owned and operated (and the cooks) by actual Italians?!? Yea, well I like sushi places to have sushi chefs that are actually from Japan! Anyways...   The menu is full of everything from rolls to nigiri and sashimi! But there's hidden gems there, mainly, OKINAWA SOBA! Yuuuup! I ordered it, and it's REAL! Just like Hamaya Soba in sunabe! Go figure, with actual Okinawans working the joint. And, for those of you that drink (I do NOT and did not) they have Orion! Yup, the only Japanese beer exclusively made and owned and operated on the tiny island of Okinawa. What a rare find that was.   The lady and the man talked the entire night and you could tell they were thrilled to have someone come in that knows there homeland. They were both so friendly and so delightful. Very much like the people of itoman, the area they are from.   The sushi was AMAZING! I ordered 4 pieces of nigiri and 2 rolls along with my soba. Before I was done I had to order another 6 pieces of nigiri. It was that good. But be warned, if you come to eat like I did, bring your wallet. Now I'm not saying it's overly expensive, in fact I found it relatively fair priced. But as you already know, good sushi, real sushi, isn't a fast food cheap meal. Please understand that. Your paying for quality, freshness, presentation and all that, and that's what you'll get here, along with good conversation.   If you're with a group, grab the tables. But if you're in a party of 3 or less, sit at the bar and talk and interact with the expert gentlemen that are preparing your dishes right in front of you.   This place is a for real 5 star joint. I will absolutely go back anytime I'm in the Phoenix area. And if you are in the Phoenix area, make a reservation and go check this place out. You will not be disappointed.   Dat sushi mayne!"}
{"text":"An overall mediocre experience this evening. The place is pretty small and gets busy quickly. We got there just in time and got a table! The host was very nice and got the table set up for a family of four. The waitress wasn't happy to see kids at the table. She was noticeably discontent with the four of us. We rushed through dinner to give her table back for the next guests. The food was fair, but nothing special. It left us wondering why the place was as highly rated as it is, but everyone has \"off nights\". This might have been one of them."}
{"text":"This is the BEST sushi  I have in US!  I happened to travel to this town and would never expect I can have sushi so authentic! If you are local, you probably know this place already.  If you are just like me traveling , this is definitely the place if you feel like some sushi."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Yelp! This was such a great find. I had a looooong day at work, missed lunch, and was starving on my way back to my hotel. Stopped in to place an order to go. The hostess was UBBER friendly! I mean, I wasn't even at a table so didn't need waiter service, but they were so nice! Offered my water while I waited and overall just really nice staff.  Now onto the food: I was a little disappointed in the sushi/roll options. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that I did order to-go and maybe they had more options at the sushi bar that I wasn't privy to, but from the menus, there was much. I settled on my go-to safe choice rainbow roll, seaweed salad, and salmon dinner. Told you I was hungry! The roll was great, but hey, it's a simple standard roll. My fav was the salmon. It was a nice piece of fish, almost like they skinned it right off of Nemo! Even had the skin on it, which I actually like. Came with salad, rice, and miso soup, which I thought smelled a little funny in the car ride, but it was VERY tasty!   I did think the food was slightly pricey, but hey, most sushi places are. I will certainly be back to Hiro and this time dine-in. Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Assortment of Sushi and Sashimi.  Very disappointed in Oyster Shooters, though.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times because it's near my office, and honestly I don't get the hype. It's very expensive for what you get and the quality is about 7/10 on everything I've had. The interior is also very squishy, dark, and unappealing. There's often a wait because of the limited seating and service can be dodgy with not enough servers on the floor. I'm not scrambling to go back anytime soon, I'd rather take a bit of a drive and go to Kodo."}
{"text":"Hiro Sushi is located in a strip mall -- between a nail salon and bakery.  When you enter, you will note some decorative items. The ambience is comfortable and laid back. Lighting is on the darker side, but not too dark.  To begin, I recommend Ama Ebi with Heads (and yes, the entire thing is eatable). As an entrée, I recommend the Beef Teriyaki. All dinner items include miso soup, steamed rice, and salad.  Sashimi/Sushi items range from about $6 to $14. Entrées range from about $16 to $26.  I must add that the portions are somewhat small for its price -- particuarly the Ama Ebi (they are very small at this restaurant). Also, the same can be said for the main items on the dinner items (ex. small amounts of beef teriyaki, chicken, etc.); and they seem to get smaller with each subsequent visit (just an observation).  Nonetheless, Hiro Sushi is certainly above average."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years now, and let me say, the sushi here is some of the best in the valley.  As the captain server of one of the most popular sushi restaurants in old town, it's easy for me to see that the quality here does not lack in any category.    The service is impeccable and the smiling faces behind the sushi bar make for an amazing dining experience.  This is a \"hope in the wall\" type place that is an absolute diamond in the rough, great work guys, keep it up! Masa-san sure knows his stuff!"}
{"text":"I love the Lunch and Sushi Specials.  It is a small, cozy place with lots of regular customers.  The Bento Box choices are excellent and the food plentiful!  They certainly don't skip on rice either-perfect for this carb lover.  Sushi appears to be fresh off the boat!"}
{"text":"1st time here. Kyoto is our go to place but they are renovating right now. Hiro is as good as all the reviews say"}
{"text":"The place force me to define what sushi really is! Until Hiro Sushi, my palet, my expectations, my knowledge, and my  experiences were something completely different than what I tasted at Hiro. What I knew, well, I don't think I could go back to that taste again. What I know now;  is one of the most special cuisine in the World that I just met. Exelent! Satisfying! Colorful!"}
{"text":"It was good. But, the nori was chewier than I'm used to. The rolls were a little loose for my liking. But the taste was great and the price was decent."}
{"text":"Oh how I wish I lived in Phoenix, so I could become a regular here. For those of you who are also on the quest to find authentic Japanese restaurants in the US, go to Hiro's if you find yourself in the area.  From the initial, \"Irrashai!\" As we walked in, the experience was like being in a little sushi joint in Japan.  My companion noted several times how great the service was and I have to agree.  I was excited to see Okinawa Soba on the menu so gave that a shot along with Otoro, salmon, Hamachi and Kani.   Ok, so the Toro did not need to be chewed it merely melted...heaven.  The last time I had Okinawa Soba was in Japan and this was the real deal even to include the hot pepper infused Awamori (ok, it was actually Vodka, but tasted the same). Our waitress had just moved here from Okinawa three years ago.   We had a Japanese rice beer... An import that was very good.   Sooo, this was overall an excellent experience and I'm glad we found it"}
{"text":"Perhaps I had low expectations for sushi in AZ, but I have to admit that they can hold their own to some of the sushi places back home.  First the negatives, or actually just negative, since I can think of only one thing - the place is tiny, so the wait could be quite long if it's a busy night (we went on Thurs, and waited about 15 mins for a party of 3).  I ordered some of the sushi: blue fin tuna, unagi, yellowtail, and scallop - they were all fresh and yummy!  In addition, we had the agedashi tofu, and the shishito peppers - both were done perfectly!  In addition to the sushi and appetizers, I ordered a combo chicken teriyaki and pork ginger...yes, I was hungry - both entrees were delicious too!  So needless to say, whenever I'm back in the area, I will definitely make an effort to return to Hiro Sushi!"}
{"text":"Hiro is the real deal - a down to earth Japanese-run sushi place with delicious fresh fish. It was around 7pm on a weekday when I walked in. The dining room was pretty busy but they had a few seats at the sushi counter. I stuck to a side of miso eggplant and some nigiri. The fish was fresh and super flavorful; the rice was perfectly vinegared too. I also had a negitoro hand roll to end the meal, which was handed to me directly by the sushi chef, as you'd expect. You won't find fancy over the top rolls and service here, but you will find authentic, high quality nigiri and sashimi."}
{"text":"Hiro Sushi is a traditional sushi bar/restaurant in Scottsdale.  It's a popular place where you can get a true Japanese experience.  My Overall Rating - 3 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)  Atmosphere - You'll find a long, traditional sushi bar along with several tables & chairs.  Now, it's not a large restaurant, so you can expect it to be full of patrons.  It can be a bit cramped in certain areas.  You're best off in a party of 4 or at the sushi bar when it's crowded.   1/2 Star.  Service - I like sushi restaurants where the server speaks Japanese.  It always makes me feel like getting authentic sushi.  Hiro Sushi passes this test.  Service was a bit slower when it got busy, but we were able to get all our orders in, order more, etc.  Great stuff here.  1 Star.  Food - We ordered the Chirashi special, which provided us with a large assortment of sashimi.  Honestly, from the ratings we thought we would be blown away, but it was good.  Also ordered some Udon noodles which provided a nice broth.  We continued with several other rolls - again solid but nothing memorable.  The entire meal is good not great, which isn't a bad thing.  1 Star.  Will I Return? - Only if I'm craving sushi in Scottsdale.  We made it here due to the high ratings, but honestly I didn't find anything so outstanding that I haven't had at many other Sushi restaurants.  There's no doubt Hiro has a loyal following, but I would only come back if sushi was the only type of cuisine I was craving.   1/2 Star.  My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts): 1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm. 1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point. 2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food. 1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return.   Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score."}
{"text":"Hands down, best sushi in Phoenix. Seriously - the best. If you're looking for an amazing experience with a mom and pop feel, this is the place. They always have amazing specials and are super friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place, the best fresh sushi in Arizona!   Since I found out about this place a few months ago I was hooked!  My hubby, daughter and I we go there 2-3x a week. We like to sit at the bar and watch them make the sushi.  Love everything I have ordered sofar so good."}
{"text":"Fantastic!   Love the authentic nature in the middle of nowhere AZ. Very fresh and large piece sushi. Very very good!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had! The sushi is always delicious and the staff is extremely friendly. It's a smaller location - but well worth any sort of wait! I love Hiro sushi... A must try in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi in the North Scottsdale Area. Started out with grilled miso eggplant that melted in your mouth with some edamame.  The spicy ribbon role and crazy roll were very flavorful but not overwhelming. Delicious  all around!"}
{"text":"Great place for a first date. Got sat immediately at the bar at 6pm on a Tuesday. Friendly service, served quickly. They also found my lost wallet and held onto it for me until I could come back."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been back, but today I had my usual lunch order. I got the bomb pieces of maguro sashimi...like straight from the dock fresh and choice pieces. When this place is on, they have the freshest and choicest pieces of fish in town. Hoping the next visit is the same..."}
{"text":"We have lived in Phoenix for 6 months now. Having been previously spoiled by living near the amazing Asian food scene on Convoy St in San Diego, we are happy to say, we finally found Japanese food that reminds us of home.  Hiro is simply delicious and won't cost you an arm and leg to enjoy."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough positive things about Hiro. This place has the freshest fish, the most authentic sushi-house vibe in town, and the nicest sushi chefs and servers in town. We arrived right at 5pm on a Saturday (without a reservation) and were quickly seated at the sushi bar. In other restaurants, this would have bothered me, but the chefs here are friendly and entertaining. The selection is wonderful, and I highly recommend whatever the fresh catch or special roll of the day is. I promise you, IT WILL BE GREAT. As mentioned, the service is exceptional. Our water glasses were never less than half full. Drink recommendations were more than helpful. And there was nothing we ordered that was not absolutely amazing. Hiro Sushi is a favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"Tldr; -Very friendly staff -Authentic feel -Fish is fresh -Appropriately priced  Came towards the end of the lunch rush for my first visit. Took less than 3 minutes to get seated at the sushi bar. My order drink order was taken quickly and I received a pleasant greeting from the sushi chefs. My server was very bubbly, but didn't ask many questions or provide additional insight on the menu or lunch specials.  I deferred choosing by selecting the Chirashi bowl. The miso soup was very hot, had excellent broth flavor with fresh green onions and large pieces of tofu!  The chirashi bowl was a little under-welming at first glance, but each piece of fish was delicious, with the exception of what I presume was red snapper. It was a much chewier than I was expecting and the flavor wasn't at the same level as the other fish.   My salad showed up after my Chirashi bowl, and I hadn't expected to eat much of it, but the flavor of the dressing was really special. I ended up eating all of the salad and would gladly come back just for the the starters.  The total cost was just shy of $20, which I would gladly play again! Came hungry and curious and left fat and happy.  I will definitely be back to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Good food, good ambiance, good prices.   I have been coming here for as long as I can remember.  The fish is always fresh, except for maybe a time or two in the dead of summer. But eating sushi in the summer in Az is always kinda iffy anyway!  It's usually pretty busy here, but the wait is never too long for a table. I love sitting at the sushi bar here, the chefs are friendly and entertaining.!"}
{"text":"Hands down the freshest, best tasting sushi in Arizona!  Their \"real crab\" California roll is amazing.  Every time we go there we get the calamari appetizer which is just lightly breaded just enough to give the tentacles a little crunch but not overdone, and the drizzle of ponzu sauce is perfect!  Their d-back roll is LOADED with crab and shrimp and the Sedona roll, when ordered with the house made hot sauce is incredible.  Their service is prompt and attentive by a warm, welcoming family run staff, but get there early if you plan to eat a lot. A \"Scottsdale bar scene\" this is not....think more \"small family run restaurant\".  When closing time comes they mean it! It is amazing how that place clears out.  You'll enjoy every piece though!"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place to find hard to find fish such as sweet shrimp, mirugai, toro, and aji. Its all fresh too! I recommend their chirashi also. The only problem is that this is such a small restaurant so if  you don't have a reservation, expect to wait an hour for a table. I usually go right when they open to beat the crowd."}
{"text":"Authentic! The sushi and sashimi here are excellent. I lived in Japan for two years, and the Bay Area for three years. Hiro sushi could operate in either aforementioned locale. The staff was friendly and everyone was able to converse in japanese with me. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"BEST sushi in the valley.  Small quaint restaurant that's usually packed so make a reservation or be prepared to wait, esp on Fridays and weekends.   Their sashimi/ nigiri is always fresh and the chefs are very welcoming.  If you are looking for an authentic Japanese sushi place this is where you should go"}
{"text":"Given all the great reviews, I was disappointed. Prices were high and the food was no better than most sushi bars. There was nothing wrong with it, it just was uninspired."}
{"text":"I have lived in Arizona since April 2013 and this is the best sushi I have had in the state so far. The spicy tuna roll was rolled to perfection with mouthwatering flavor. The YELLOWTAIL nigiri melts in your mouth and is by far the best yellowtail I have EVER had. We also tried the spicy octopus which was also perfectly flavored and not too spicy; the texture was spot on.   Walking up to the restaurant it looked a little \"sketchy\" but the moment you walk in the door the restaurant is booming with people and you are kindly greeted by the hostess and sushi chefs. The sushi chefs have a sense of humor, and I rarely sit at the sushi bar, but we did, and it was worth it! They are skilled, and constantly laughing and cheerful as they prepare your food.   I will be returning! I would suggest calling ahead. It is a small restaurant and I think the secret is out (at least on yelp) of how good this place its."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. Both times the service has been fantastic, they're really on top of that but I wasn't impressed with the fish. Maybe it was because both days I went were on Mondays. I've heard that Mondays and sometimes Sundays aren't the prime days to eat sushi due to when they get their shipments in. That's the only thing I can think of. Both times we had sushi that tasted well...fishy.  We ordered a few appetizers, the yellow tail cheek, baked mussels, and baked clams. The yellow tail cheek I've never had before so I have nothing to compare it to but it was a little crispy and burnt on the outside and I didn't much care for it. You had to dig through all the bones to get just a few little scraps of fish. The sauce they served with it was good though.  The spicy baked mussels and clams were in a mayo sauce that was okay but not fantastic. Normally my favorite part of these dishes is the sauce, but the mayo didn't seem thick enough and both came out soupy and lacking flavor. They were just mediocre.   We ordered the tuna tataki & albacore tataki. I thought the tuna tataki tasted very fishy and so did one of my dining partners. Our other dining partner thought it was okay though and ate our portions. The albacore tataki was seared quite a bit on the outside, giving it a rubbery texture that made it not taste right. I didn't care for either.   We ordered a lot- various nigiri, spicy scallop roll, spicy tuna roll, Houston roll (salmon, onion, cucumber), jazz roll, Arizona roll, rainbow roll, and I'm sure others. I thought the spicy scallop and Houston roll were the best but nothing was out-of-this-world. I just wasn't impressed either time we went there. 2.5 stars for the food, 5 stars for the service."}
{"text":"As you approach this building from the outside, you don't really expect alot, or at least I didn't. It's in a strip plaza (across the street from the Fry's on 90th), surrounded by shops catering toward spyware and vitamins. Odd, huh? In any case, you walk in and immediately notice how small the place is. Some may call it quaint - perhaps that's a nicer way of saying \"i could walk the length of the restaurant if I took 50 giant steps.\"   Sushi bar is where to go. The chefs are polite and offer suggestions. Don't expect to be entertained, but do expect to receive your order in a timely fashion.   You get a clean towel here, too. And prompt beverage service. 3.50 for a Sapporo - you can't go wrong.   So, is there anything extraordinary about this place? Not really, but perhaps that's why it works. Without the loud music and flashy scene of Scottsdale, you instead find succulent sashima in generous portions, along with a menu that makes you \"hmmm\" and \"uhmmm\" a bit longer than usual.   Miso soup is medicore (i've had better) and the edamame is refreshing without a thunderstorm of salt - thankfully!  Jazz Roll. Crazy Roll. Shrimp Tempura Roll. How do you decide? When it doubt, just try it all. Or get the Caterpillar Roll - it's made different from other places. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something oddly wonderful about mixing textures - from the softness of the rice and avacado to the crunchyness of the inside. Oh, and eel is divine. So is the extra bonus of shrimp ontop.   I wouldn't consider this my fave place, and it's definitely not in my neighborhood... but if you live, work or just happen to be in the area, definitely stop into Hiro. You shouldn't leave disappointed, unless you're expecting something other than great food, friendly staff and, lo and behold, a restaurant where you actually hear Japanese spoken by the staff. Now that's worth a bonus star!"}
{"text":"Best I have ever had !! Definitely a must try if you are in the are! All the sushi is fresh the sushi chefs are super friendly. Try the uni it's soooo good and Fresh!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've had for a very long time, impressed by the service. We got there with no reservation at opening time, there was already a line in front door, sat at sushi bar, but despite busy time they removed a chair for us to fit our baby's stroller between us. We will be regulars from now on.  Staff is super friendly, and helpful."}
{"text":"I really was so disappointed in this place. I was excited to eat here because of all the ratings. Maybe I'm spoiled in California but the sushi rolles here are bland and tasteless.  What a waste of my money. If this is one of the best in the area all I have to say is you have my condolences."}
{"text":"Hiro Sushi is the most authentic and best tasting Japanese food in the Phoenix Valley.  All the servers say thank you, yes, and your welcome in Japanese.  I have not been to Japan in more than 20 years, but the service reminds me from what I saw in Japanese restaurants in Tokyo as a child.  The sushi is extremely fresh like it came from the ocean too.  Hiro gets the best of the best in terms of quality."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town!  Brought tears to my eyes to find this place!  They do a great job with the basics and have a fine selection of off menu items on the board behind the sushi bar.  The Gyoza was tasty and delicious and made fresh there on the premises!  Ended the meal with some strawberry and chocolate mochi! Yum!  Friendly and warm staff.  There is just nothing to complain about here.  They nail it on all counts!"}
{"text":"I am not one to hyperbolize but Hiro Sushi is the best sushi that I have been able to find in the valley. The food here is fresh, meticulously prepared, and delicious. I would typically point out favorite dishes and suggestions but I have loved everything that I have ever tried here. Subject to your tastes, you simply cannot go wrong. The prices are extremely fair, the sushi is prepared by people who actually know what they are doing, and you will enjoy your experience.  Make sure to have reservations when possible. It's tough to just walk in at 6:00 PM and expect to be seated right away."}
{"text":"When Japanese sports players come to town (especially baseball), they come here. And my Japanese friend used to come here whenever she missed her home. I am sure that this tells you a lot :)   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in the entire city of Scottsdale. The food is incredible, service is great but what I love most is seeing the sushi chefs create everything- they bring personality to their product and that is important. This is a small restaurant and there is very little room for pretentious people in the place, perfect."}
{"text":"Maybe it's better when you dine-in, but the take out sushi was horrible across the board.  It was chewy and appeared old.  I was somewhat surprised when I arrived 5 minutes after I ordered, and my sushi was already waiting for me.  But the way it tasted, it was probably prepared earlier and was sitting around.  My wife suggested calling to maybe get a voucher for a future visit, but then I'd have to eat more bad sushi.  No thanks!"}
{"text":"Unquestionable 5 stars. Take away the 5 star service and there's 5 star food to back it up.  To this day I have not had such incredible Japanese food in Arizona, only comparable in LA the miso soup reminded me of my favorite (now closed) Japanese restaurant in LA. The sushi was to die for as was the teriyaki. This place is a winner.   I recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"Alaxandra-'Hey, who wants to join me for my birthday lunch'  Me- 'I'll go' That response was all it took and now I have 'my sushi spot'  It is a small restaurant with a lot to offer. Every time I walk in, I feel like I am stepping into a true Japanese restaurant. You get greeted by the 'sushi experts' ;) with a big welcome -spoken in Japanese- which I have yet to ask what exactly they are saying, but they sound happy and that's all that matters.  The freshest seafood, the best specials and the most fantastic miso soup, YUM! My goal is try almost everything on the menu and so far I am doing pretty good."}
{"text":"I was running out of time to spend in Phoenix but I just couldn't possibly pass the opportunity to try Hiro Sushi, especially after reading these amazing reviews from you fellow yelpers.  I called in and placed a take-out order as I was driving towards the restaurant.  You gotta do what you gotta do for food you can't get in your city.  ;)  While waiting for my food around 6pm on a Friday evening on their little bench by the entrance, groups after groups and couples after couples made their ways into the restaurant.  Most of them have reservations, which definitely suggested me to be sure to make a reservation for my future visit.  As much of Hiro as I saw, there were numerous pictures of famous people with the same Japanese man.  (Perhaps Hiro, the restaurant owner?)  The restaurant persuaded a cozy feeling.  The traditional noren by the entrance and the actual Japanese chefs earned bonus points in my book.  As the waiter handed me my food, and my check, I was sad I had to leave Hiro.  Without even trying their food, I knew I wanted to come back for the full experience, the whole SHEBANG!  I was tempted the whole entire drive to unpack that brown bag.  As soon as I got home, I was pleased to find how nice everything was packaged up.  Everything was there as if I was served in a restaurant; the thinly sliced ginger, wasabi, packaged soy sauce, sauce for my hiro roll, my foam container for my rolls was even decorated?.  I appreciated the fact that they were thoughtful enough to separate the sauce for my long drive.  If I remember it correctly, hiro roll is supposed to be served in their special sauce, which means my roll would be soaky when I get home.  Both rolls tasted delicious even though they were made an hour ago.  I only wished I ordered more food.  :P  I had no complaint as far as food concerns.  Hiro by far serves the best sushi I have had in Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  I did think the bill was a bit pricey but after tasted their food, it was no longer a concern.  I am giving Hiro a four-star rating because it didn't quite match the best I had in Asia."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley. Japanese owned and run. Very authentic! My husband likes to speak Japanese with them and remember his time in Japan... always an extra treat along with an amazing dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi and service! When you want the more traditional, quiet setting rather than the trendy \"hip\" sushi places, this is it. Very fresh all through. Definitely try the Albacore tataki!"}
{"text":"Let me starts by saying this: This restaurant has the best sushi in town.   It was my friend's birthday and I wanted to take her some place special. My yelp friend, Karen, recommended this place to me. It's a bit of a drive from Chandler. But if it's good food, I'm willing to drive anywhere. I made a reservation for 2 at 5p.m. and was the first person who arrived. First hint that tells me they are legit was seeing a group of Japanese guys waiting for it to open when i arrived. Second hint - shortly after the door was opened, the restaurant was already packed.   We ordered Aghi tofu and spicy squid as our appetizers. The aghi tofu is definitely the best I've ever had. The \"spicy squid\" that we ordered was not spicy at all. Nevertheless, I still like it. It was seasoned well and very juicy. Just the right amount of portion for appetizers. For our main entree, we ordered a sashimi combo to share and replace two pieces of clams with two additional pieces of tuna and yellow tail ($1 for each item you switch out, what a deal). Every single piece is fresh, delicious, and literally melts in your mouth. I cannot be any happier to order that. We also ordered Eel sushi (2 pieces each order) and it was cooked exactly to our liking. I love the eel sauce that comes with it. Super delicious!!!!   I was a bit disappointed that the hostess did not tell our waitress that it was my friend's birthday. I reminded them upon reservation as well a reminding the hostess when i arrived. When our waitress gave us the bill, I told her that it was my friend's birthday. She politely took the bill away and arrived with the tempura ice-cream. Even though she didn't bring back the \"green tea\" ice-cream that we specifically asked for, it was still delicious. They literally shut off all the lights at the restaurant and sing to my friend along with the guests. She was sooooo happy.  Overall, this has been a wonderful experience for my friends and I. You bet I'll come back here again. Thank you for the wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Sushi was very fresh.  Staff was very nice.  Try the potstickers as an appetizer.  They're d"}
{"text":"I didn't know what real sushi was until I first came to Hiro. It totally blew all the other \"fancy\" sushi places I'd been to out of the water. I used to never like straight raw fish, but the fish they use here is so fresh and tender it melts like butter in your mouth. Everything here is good, the chefs and employees are very accommodative, and the ambiance makes you feel like you're walking into a sushi place in Japan. I always look forward to the next time I can go back and experience it all over again!"}
{"text":"Super high-quality sushi, the salmon was amazing! We were a little disappointed with the lack of choices and small menu. I would absolutely return and will suggest to other locals :)"}
