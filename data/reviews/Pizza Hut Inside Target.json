{"text":"Horrible service waiting more then 15 minuets for a pizza while they give to guest that ordered after me."}
{"text":"This is a somewhat basic Pizza Hut Express.  They carry three types of personal 6\" pan pizzas ($4.29); Cheese, Pepperoni and Supreme.  They also have bread stick ($2.49) and marinara sauce for dipping.  This location has hot dogs, chips and Coca-Cola fountain drinks.  What no Pepsi?  I like their Icee slushy drink that comes in four flavors.   Both the Starbucks and Pizza Hut Express open early, just after six on weekdays.  They also have breakfast sandwiches on Biscuits, along with Hash-browns.  The food is good, though as I said somewhat basic.  I don't come here very often. But given the traffic this morning, it's the new hangout for parents who just dropped their kids off at school.  It's replacing the old Starbucks near Einstein's."}
