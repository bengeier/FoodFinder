{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet: GET THE 17A! You won't be disappointed. The broth is delicious, and the beef chunks are way better than the regular slabs or beef balls in the other dishes. The giant carrot chunks add so much flavour to this satisfying bowl of hearty pho."}
{"text":"The food was OK but the service was really bad. I had to get up out of my seat to ask for a take away container since there were no servers around and the table next to me had to get up to order since once again there were no servers around. I also found a bug in my soup on multiple occasions. Overall the service was terrible."}
{"text":"After enough bad experiences with the food and the services in the past year, I will no longer be returning to this establishment.

For years, I have been a returning customer to Pho Kim.  Back in the day when I was a pipsqueak of a child, Vietnamese cuisine was still wonderfully new.  I stumbled upon Pho Kim through word of mouth.  At the time, Pho Kim was one of the better places to go and the food was godly in my eyes.

After a number of renovations, not to mention turnover of staff, the popularity of this establishment began to dissipate along with the food quality and service.  In this year alone, I've had bland soups, soggy vermicelli, thawed out frozen vegetables which resembled wet sponges than they did a cucumber, and limpy beansprouts.  Although I tried so much to keep on loving Pho Kim, their food was overall bland and lacked a freshness that is so needed in Vietnamese food.  Even my boyfriend who is not a picky eater had also stated that the shredded pork and porkchops had an odd taste which lead to some minor food poisoning upon our last visit.

The service at Pho Kim has worsened over the years where I have found the staff to be extremely abrasive and not very accommodating to their customers.  I had the odd occasion recently of staff not returning any of my change (I pay by cash) - I'm sorry but I'm not going to give a $10 \"tip\" for a $12 dollar dish.  Its bad enough that staff assume they are going to be tipped which reflects in their attitude upon paying the bill, but its just plain rude for restaurants to withhold the change of a customer thinking its theirs to keep, no matter how big or small the amount is.

Overall, Pho Kim is off my list for restaurants to dine at.  Their poor food quality and service was the last straw where I will definitely not be returning.  For other diners, perhaps you will have more luck than me, however I suggest that you try someplace else for better quality Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I usually get pho tai or pho sate and the prices are better than a lot of places nearby. I am a very messy pho eater and usually use lots of napkins and Pho Kim gives you as many as you want unlike most places. I recommend this place to all my friends. One time I accidentally squirted sriracha sauce all over the wall and they didn't even care. I give this place a 9.5/10."}
{"text":"Pho Kim has your typical decoration for a quick service Pho place, but an above average selection of soups. My wife had the sat√© beef soup and asked for extra peanuts. They obliged, and the broth was pretty tasty, but essentially devoid of spicy heat. I ordered from the sizeable non-Pho soup menu, which has glass noodles, thick noodles, egg noodles and more. More Chinese influenced non-soup items also make an appearance. The stewed rib meat and carrots/potatoes with egg noodles was a nice, hardy change up on a -23C evening. We got some spring rolls to start, but they were just a bit undercooked in terms of delivering that essential crispness. In sum, Pho that tastes fine if not spicy, good non-standard options for a crowd that wants variety, and room for improvement on the spring roll execution."}
{"text":"Every time I'm there, they make me feel as if though I am family. I also appreciate the presentation of the food."}
{"text":"The service could really use a boost.  How about trying to be friendly and timely?

I've only been here a few times, but every time, the food DID deliver.  The soup is great, and the portion sizes are good and the mains are decent.  The place is affordable, as well.

If you're looking for a casual place with a solid soup, I'd recommend coming here, but certainly not if you're in the mood for good ambiance and proper service."}
{"text":"Quick service and consistently great noodles. Probably the best pho in Calgary. I'm not super fond of the spring rolls here.  The filling is a little like baby food wrapped in a crispy shell.  I've never actually tried the Bun here.  The satay noodles are not anything to rave about.  It seems like it's just the chili oil that sits at your table added into the classic pho.  Nonetheless, if you want just simple straightforward vietnamese pho this is the place to go in calgary.  I don't go anwhere else."}
{"text":"I had been hearing about Pho Kim from my son for about 3 years. I finally took him for lunch along with his Grandma last year. I have been back at least 5 or 6 times, even though the drive is about a 35 minute commute. We usually order Sate Beef Pho and enjoy it every time. This is my favourite dish spring, summer, fall and especially winter! Hot delicious spicy broth which is not like some dishwater soup broth I have experienced elsewhere. Service is about the same as anywhere else I have been for Vietnamese, quick but extremely un-engaging. According to my son they used to be cranky and mean there a couple years back and accused him of trying to make limeade with his glass of water when he asked for sugar for the Jasmine tea. Haha right, guess you should not judge him like he is a cheapskate when he still tips for cranky service. Now that my son is no longer a teenager he says they treat him much nicer. I have never had a bad experience here and always enjoy the Pho. My other dining companions have had the vermicelli and gave it the thumbs up too. I know I will be back again sometime soon."}
{"text":"I recently attended a social function at Pho Kim and had a pretty awesome experience. Not only was the company wonderful and the food delicious, but the service was actually impressively stellar as well; I generally find that Vietnamese noodle houses have relatively slipshod service when compared to most Western eateries, but I was pleased with the amount of care and attention we were given by the servers that night - especially considering the size of our group.

The event I went to was a \"meet and greet pho night\" with the University of Calgary's Vietnamese Students' Association, where forty of us descended on this renovated house-restaurant like ravenous beasts. Thankfully, we had booked in advance; the place was packed on both levels (which, I've heard, is commonplace for Pho Kim), and the poor serving girls had to navigate both stairs and other, bewildered diners as they carried tray upon tray to our massive party. Aside from a couple of drink mix-ups, all of our orders came in good time and with a great amount of deliciousness. The portion sizes were just right (from a decent small to a humongous extra-large), and the variety of dishes was fair. And of course, having a relative pricing scheme to most other Vietnamese restaurants, our dinner was wonderfully inexpensive - perfect for the poor student looking for a cost-effective (yet satisfying) meal.

This event also had the added benefit of convincing my boyfriend that \"pho!\" wasn't a noise of disgust made as a commentary on Vietnamese soup noodles. The only other time I'd managed to get him to a noodle house, the food happened to be terrible. Now, I'm hard pressed to convince him to go elsewhere for food. One step at a time, I guess."}
{"text":"Pho Kim has recently added more options to their vegetarian menu, which is very exciting!  I haven't seen another place in town yet who does a vegetarian Bun Bo Hue or Bho Kho.  Both dishes capture the essence of spices in the original dish.  Looking forward to trying the rest of their vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Went here at 2pm on a weekday and the place was pretty empty. Pho broth is flavorful and the vegetarian is better than most pho places I've tried - you get a variety of vegetables instead of just pho without the meat. Garden spring rolls pretty mediocre but Cambodian boyfriend says the durian smoothie is one of the best in town. Fried quail was flavorful and cooked well, would eat again.  Overall, good pho and decent price."}
{"text":"This was a pit stop for us on the way to Banff. It was a cold night in Calgary and pho is always a great idea. I thought it was easy, fast, and good. Satisfying for what it is. 

The portion was just perfect for me, I ordered a medium. I always get the pho dac biet, combination of everything yummy that can go into pho. 

It's good for groups because there were 13 of us and they had no problems seating us. 

Nothing is special about this pho place that would make it stand out to me, but there's nothing bad that would make me not want to make another pit stop here when I'm back in Canada."}
{"text":"Good little place for Vietnamese noodles but the soup sometimes are not warm enough! It depends on the cook I guess since it is not consistent and food service can either be quick or very slow! I like it here because its not crowded!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and while it was better than my first time, it's still only average at best compared to some of the other Vietnamese place in town. I ordered the 25b, a vermicelli dish with shrimp and beef and it was good, but not stellar. I had the curry chicken dish last time around, and was let down - too soupy and not a lot of chicken at all.

I also tried the coconut slush (without the damn bubbles) and loved it!

Price was decent. $22 for 2 lunches and a slush."}
{"text":"If you are hungry pho noodles are fast service. As long as you get your orders in. Lots of light snacks too."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a place that satisfies my pho cravings like Pho Kim. The food is always delicious and the staff super friendly, hence why I've been coming back for years! :)  My only issue is with parking as it's pretty limited but regardless I'd recommend this place for a delicious Vietnamese meal."}
{"text":"Trying to find parking here was a bit of a nightmare for starters. It's a pretty small place and there are a bunch of \"no parking\" zones around it.
Having finally found a parking spot, we headed inside. We met up with my sis and her hubby here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Ordering food was done via one sheet for the whole table - there appeared to be no method to split the bill until pay time (and I'll get back to that later).
Our food came - I'd ordered the rare beef pho, and it was pretty good. Not the best or most amazing I've ever had, but it was good. My sister's husband complained how the spicy dish wasn't spicy (but then again, he proceeded to eat the hot red pepper that came with my pho by itself and not break a sweat).
We had to flag down a waitress for water and to get stuff wrapped to go. She pretty much left us on our own, never checking on how we were or if we were enjoying the food. Maybe that's normal (I don't know) but having worked in f & b for the first 10 of my working years I expect a bit more than to be served and completely left alone.
Now it came time to pay for the food : this website (as in Yelp) said that they accept credit cards. They *only* accept Visa, which tends not to work well if you have anything else (like we did). Also, they have this policy where not only do they do 1 bill per table, but if you want to split a bill they will only take cash. Even if only 1 person pays with debit or credit, they refuse and say \"If you are splitting the bill, cash only!\" That was a bit of a dealbreaker for me, so unles someone reports that they have removed or changed that policy, I doubt I'll be going back here."}
{"text":"I will not be returning to this restaurant because it is visibly less clean than almost any restaurant that I have ever eaten at. I should have been guided by first impressions, which included smeared and dirty windows. Above our table was an air conditioner with two tubes running down the wall to an open plastic bucket about a foot from my feet. Our table was clean, as we're the dishes, but all around the room were examples of surfaces, which were smeared and dirty. It really appears as if the thinking is that as long as the food is not contaminated, anything goes for the rest of the place. I've over-looked  lots of less than ideally clean restaurants, because the food was worth it, but that is not the case here."}
{"text":"I can say for me that this place is somewhere I will never attend. My friend enjoyed his meal, but as a VEGETARIAN they are downright awful. They made me feel horrible for being a vegetarian because both servers kept sighing to thinking of option for me to eat. The girl server left, and the guy server was left to deal with me, the demanding customer. He suggested vermicelli with fried veggies, peanuts, and it'll almost be like some sort of pad thai, it wasn't. When the food came out.. It was a plate of what looked like canned vegetables, which were cold, and the vermicelli had no sauce (sort of pad thai my ass) it was simply the noodles alone. I had two bites and it was distasteful. They didn't care about me as a customer and my needs, which are very basic. I've been to enough pho places where they have plenty of vegetarian options. I hate to rant, but for once I felt bad for inconveniencing them. When I went to pay, he didn't even ask me about my food, after he took away a full plate. I can't believe he didn't ask what was wrong, or even try to accommodate me. He charged me FULL PRICE!! Even though the people who may read/skim this post may think I am a hippy that complains too much.. no... simply just letting you know of service you shouldn't have to go through."}
{"text":"I am still on a soup diet as my cold has turned into a sinus infection - NOT good for a foodie to not be able to taste nor smell anything... but tonight this place was recommended to us and Pho cures all right?
Parking was not an issue as it was 9pm on a Thurs. The parking lot right across the street is fine to park in after 6pm. Pho Kim closes at 10pm and staff (owner?) were happy to seat us. Service was great throughout the meal and super quick too. The restaurant was not too busy but the people that were dining there - were characters, good for a few chuckles.
We ordered a chicken Pho soup and a beef satay which was my #15 and said to be the most popular. The guy in the booth behind me, \"Jimmy\" (who owns a popular deli in town) mentioned that I HAD to have it. How bad could it be if I could not taste right? Although, texture still very important of course. We also got a side of piping hot fried spring rolls. Wow, cannot wait to come back and try those again! My #15 Pho had beautiful med. rare beef slices in it (plentiful) and the rice noodles were done to perfection. I loved how they mixed a couple of whole fresh red chiles in with the bean sprouts and lime plate.
The restaurant is in a modified house tucked into Centre B St just south of 16. Quaint and clean.
Not a lot of seafood on the menu.
Props for hot tea on the table just after you are seated!
Will be back even though there are still 1000012 Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary to try!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the non-boring veggie broth pho vegan option.... Vegan Bo Koh (beef stew noodles). seriously? So rich and tasty!"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5
Overall experience: 4/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

No doubt about it, there are plenty of pho restaurants in Calgary. There must be at least one on each block! 

Anyways, my friends and I have had a fair share of Pho (vietnamese noodle soup) and Pho Kim is one of best places to get Pho so far (been here a couple times). I usually don't drink the soup in my Pho unless it's fantastic, and Pho Kim has gotten it right! Absolutely delicious- has a perfect balance of flavours and is not too salty or sweet. I really like how they have different sizes (small, medium, large, XL) because I usually can't finish a 'large' which is a default size for most places. There is also plenty of meat which is awesome because I hate getting a huge portion of noodles and a few slices of beef.

The service here is quick. You get your Pho within 10 min of ordering so it's a great place to grab a quick bite. It's usually always full during lunch, and is not really an upscale Viet restaurant like you would find in Downtown. Prices for the Pho is average and about the same everywhere else (around $7-$8).

I haven't tried anything else on their menu besides the Pho and according to my friend the portions of other items on the menu are not worth the price. Overall, I suggest you pay a visit for some great Pho here!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and mediocre food. The food comes quickly, but it is lacking in taste and freshness. We weren't asked if we wanted anything to drink other than the jasmine tea. Our waiter never came around to check on our table. Worst, when we went to pay, they told us the debit wasn't working. None of us carry cash, so the lady rudely told one of us to go to the bank so we could pay. Don't expect to use debit or credit here, if you plan on coming here (which I absolutely do not recommend) make sure you bring cash."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Pho places in Calgary but I think Pho Kim is number 1. Delicious pho with a lot of variety and cheap for the amount you get! What more could you ask for in a Pho restaurant?"}
{"text":"Pho Kim used to be a weekly haunt after Saturday morning Tai Chi but my group was slightly turned off when one busy Saturday we had barely finished our meal and were asked to leave so that they could have the table as there were people waiting. I think it was more how we were asked than the fact that we were asked. Asian food establishments are really about turnover and the philosophy is very practical: we sell food, you eat and go, no lingering for conversation and more tea!
Pho Kim has been in business a long time but it can be hard to place unless you are familiar with the area as it is off-Centre St. It is in a converted house that is kitty-corner from the Central Landmark Mall which is on the corner of 16 Avenue and Centre St. N. (SW corner). There is a City of Calgary parking lot right across the street with reserved spots for Pho Kim so parking is free if you can snag one of those spots; otherwise parking is on the street. 
Weekends can be a traffic nightmare navigating between people and cars trying to get into the Central Landmark parking lot or the Lambda parking lot on the other side so be forewarned that you need the patience of a saint if you choose to enter the area on a weekend.
Pho is good here. I had the well-done beef and beef ball pho in the small. I really like the fact that there is a small size and it is a perfect size. The portion of beef meat to noodles is fair and the broth flavourful. Cost is around $8. They also include a fresh Thai chilli pepper with the fresh sprouts and basil that automatically comes with Pho. Some places make you ask for the pepper. 
One of my friends had the Bun and was quite pleased with what she got. Judging from the looks of the chicken, beef and shrimp, I would definitely give the Bun a try. The chicken was large chunks of chicken breast and looked moist and well-seasoned. The bun is around $11-12 and served in the medium sized bowl.
We got there about 11 a.m. so the place was pretty much deserted but I know from past experience that an hour later the place starts to fill up with people trying to get lunch in either before or after their grocery shopping.
Service was pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"Pho Kim's has been steadfastly good basic Vietnamese food for as long as I can remember. It's hard to go wrong here, it's real and it's authentic and it's reasonably priced.  What I ate in Vietnam tasted about the same as what I get at Pho Kim's! It's one of the few places that actually serves tea without an extra charge. It's much cleaner now than it used to be a decade ago, which is also pretty fantastic - a must have for any restaurant. I probably hit this place once a month!"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight and thought it was dam fine :D . We started with salad rolls that were very fresh , tasty and promptly delivered to our table . Next we had some pho and bun , both were very tasty and a generous portion . My dates bun was the beef noodle and had a delayed heat to it ,that was great !  We will be back !"}
{"text":"Good ph√µ priced right however service comes with an attitude where every visit is a different experience. Closing hours are somehow flexible during slow evenings so be ready for a takeout menu. Venue is casual, nothing fancy and inconspicuously hidden in a strip mall."}
{"text":"I could write up a long review but the simple fact is that this is the gold standard for pho in Calgary. 

If you're looking for great service, high class dining you might as well go elsewhere. But if you're interested in trying some of the best pho this city has to offer, look no further. 

I approve highly."}
{"text":"Having finished a morning seminar, we were looking for a quick place to grab lunch. Apparently Saturday around noon is very busy in the area, so finding parking was a bit problematic, tow truck trolling the streets and all.

We were seated quickly; the menu is pretty typical for pho establishments. However, I am a big fan of stirfried lemongrass chicken and all they had was grilled on the menu. They did, however, have stirfried lemongrass beef (which I cannot eat) so I was disappointed I couldn't get the chicken.

The food came fairly quickly - it was satisfactory. Nothing special but tasty nonetheless. We were left alone for the entire meal, which was an issue as we were wanting water halfway through eating but couldn't order it until we were pretty much finished. Likewise, getting some food wrapped up and asking for the bill were difficult. 

The part that brought this down a star or two was paying for the meal. When we got to the cashier, we saw a sign that said any bills that were to be split up had to be paid entirely in cash. Not sure why... So, we decided that I'd pay the entire bill by Mastercard and the other half would pay me cash (I NEVER carry cash). However, the other half wasn't sure they had enough cash on them. But the woman behind the cashier seemed unwilling to tell us what our respective totals were without payment being in hand first, until I demanded to see a menu so I could add it up myself. Then she finally pulled out a calculator. An unnecessary frustration and time-waster. Finally, when I handed over my Mastercard, she said rudely they only took Visa and Interac. Why Visa and not Mastercard? I rarely use my debit card - I probably racked up $2 in service fees, now.

So, all in all, for poor service and average food, another visit just wouldn't be worth it."}
{"text":"Whenever the weather is cold and wet, I always find a big bowl of soup very comforting. So in a cold Calgary day, we decided to check this place out for lunch. 

The restaurant is pretty big and very good for large groups. The menu has all of the standards Vietnamese dishes, However, I was there just to try the Pho, I ordered my favorite, Pho with everything ( tripe, tendon . .......) 

The soup arrived fast and hot, However, I was really disappointed with the aroma and taste. It was relatively bland and even with addition of ton of hot sauce and fish sauce, still not that good. In my opinion the proportion of noodles to goodies was off. Too much noodle for too little goodies. Pho looks like a simple dish, but the broth should be prepared with a lot of care which was not the case here.

I have tried much better Pho in Calgary and most probably I am not going back there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's friend invited my boyfriend and me to have Vietnamese food for lunch when we came back from Toronto during the weekend. I am not a Vietnamese food fan.  But, the one we had, was very great. We went to Pho Kim's Vietnamese Noodle House for lunch. It located on Centre B St NW, Calgary, AB T2M 2R5.  It is a very big restaurant, has two floors. We arrived the restaurant around 12 pm right on the lunchtime. The restaurant was very full already. We were very lucky to find a table Upstairs.  We all had the Noodle Soup with beef ball, rare beef, flank, tripe & tendon with different sizes. I had a small size, my boyfriend had large, and his friend had x large. All the noodle soup was in the large portion. They were all very well cooked and fresh. Even though I don't really like the Vietnamese Noodle Soup, I really enjoy having noodles at Pho Kim's. Very great experience."}
{"text":"Looking for Pho with a home-made feel? Check this place out. 

I was craving hot, filling soup on a cold evening in February and on a spur of the moment we went to Pho Kim for the first time. We had passed by it before and the reviews on Yelp showed promise. 

The verdict? Pho Kim hit the spot!

We came around 530pm. There were free parking spaces at the back of the restaurant, but there's also a large paid lot in front.

We went straight for the beef noodle soups, large (#1 for me and #4 for the hubby). We also had the #21, thin rice sheets with pork sausage and veggies. The latter was just okay but the Pho was great! 

Sure, the place is a little low key, but the service is pretty on point and their soups are hearty, filling and tasty! 

I plan to come back for sure to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"So came here for dinner. They have 3 sizes for their noodle: Small, Large and X-Large. Their prices are cheaper than if you were to eat pho in downtown. They do not charge for tea here. 

Restaurant is a bit dark. Its not very big inside. I got the Pho Kim Special basically soup noodle number 1. I personally liked it. It was good. I got the L which is basically the regular size. It sure did fill me up. The broth has a nice flavor to it and you know there is no msg or not much msg. I mean I wasn't thirsty afterward. Enough meat in the noodle.  

Place is clean. Good Service."}
{"text":"What makes pho so good? The broth of course!!   I heard a joke once about pho broth being cooked and simmered for 40 days and 40 nights and that's what makes the broth tasty (sorry can't remember the joke but my Vietnamese friends were laughing hysterically). 

The broth at Pho Kim comes out steaming, & the taste is beefy and flavourful. Best yet, I was not dying of thirst afterwards which truly attests to the authenticity of their broth!!   I wonder if they cook their broth for 40 days and 40 nights  ;-) haha .  Bowl sizes are S, L, XL from $7+.  In comparing portion to price, it's a little more expensive than other places but I'm willing to pay an extra $1-$2 for better pho.  If you're looking for a 'regular' size of pho, go for the Large size for only $0.50 more than the small.  

Parking is on the street w/ meters or there's a paid lot across the street.  It does get busy at lunch but once you order, the food comes out quick."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst customer's experience I ever had. 

First of all, no soap in the washroom. Small detail, but kinda essential.

Second, I sit during at least 10-15 minutes before receiving the menu. I had to call them from my cellphone to let them know I was in the restaurant actually ready to order. 

Third, food and tea lack flavour. Vietnamese raviolis, stuffed with mushrooms and pork were so tasteless and soggy. Pho was also bland. Beef was at least good and tender.

Finally, service wasn't the best either. It was slow and unfriendly.

Sadly, I wouldn't recommend that place if you're craving for an authentic Pho."}
{"text":"What happened?? This used be one of my favourite VN Restaurants. No longer. 
The spring rolls were tasteless and almost too tough to chew through. And my #27 (vermicelli with assorted toppings) was cold. 
Terrible meal. I shall never return."}
{"text":"pho kim is one of my go-to spots for pho. what sets pho kim apart is their broth, full of rich flavour which has undoubtedly been slowly brewing since the wee hours of the morning.  some pho restaurants are guilty of using packaged seasoning.  how can you tell?  

the measuring bar for me, when rating the quality of a bowl of pho is how thirsty i feel after the meal.  if you feel the need to drink an excessive amount of water after your meal, you probably ate a bowl using packaged seasonings for the soup broth.  you'd be surprised how many places do this.

i don't find this to be the case with pho kim.  my usual is a mixture of the rare beef, beef tendon, tripe and meatballs - a wonderland of deliciousness with various delightful textures.  when it's a hot day during the summer, i often also go for the Bun Thit Nuong - grilled pork, spring roll and vermicelli, which is fresh, light and tasty.

service is always prompt and attentive, when you need them to be.  reasonably priced (for today - i remember when pho used to be $5 for an XL bowl back in the day) and conveniently located by 16th ave and center street.  4 stars from me, since i'm a regular."}
