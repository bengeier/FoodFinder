{"text":"On a attendu 15 Minutes pour deux cappuccinos. De plus, les cappuccinos ont le goût de l'eau. Je sais pas si on a vraiment été malchanceux mais en tout cas je le conseille pas au vu de mon expérience. C'est dommage parce que le style est sympa"}
{"text":"This used to be a great coffee house.  Was Owned and operated by two women.  Seems like it has changed hands to Arab owners which turned this quaint coffee shop to garbage.  Too bad it was a nice little place for well brewed coffee and peaceful space. 
Would never return."}
{"text":"Food: Large variety of coffee! Coffee is super good and always well brewed! I have tried their carrot muffin which is not overly sweet (huge!) and croissant (not as good as the ones in regular bakeries). I would remind coffee only~

Service: Staff is very friendly

Value: Fair price.

Ambiance: Always a great little coffee shop to stop by to grab a coffee and a light snack with a friend. Great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Joli petit café que j'ai essayé lors d'une déambulation sur st-denis un après-midi de novembre.  Choix de cafés & autres à déguster sur place intéressant (café du jour, de spécialités, glacés, chocolats chauds, etc.)

Pour s'assoir devant un bon livre ou entre amis pour discuter un bon moment, cest un endroit tout désigné et leur café a su réconforter mon coeur refroidi par le vent d'automne :-)"}
{"text":"Unassuming spot in the St denis. Stopped in for a coffee. Stayed for brunch. Service is excellent be it French speaking or not. Server is very accommodating and the food is quite excellent"}
{"text":"we just stopped by but had an excellent coffee by chance. 

their specialty is coffee from everywhere in the world. i had an americano with \"Arabica 4 continents\" but was very delicious. perfect for bitter and non-sour fans. i bought 250g of the beans but costed me like 7$. 

servers are nice and friendly, not that \"tip me\" service. their pâtisserie was pretty good too, im definitely coming back for a break in terrase."}
{"text":"The coffee is quite good and flavorful, but overpriced. Service was slow at first but our server was really nice but overworked as some other employees were sitting back and not really doing as much."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  My sister and I discovered it while we were visiting Montreal on vacation and literally were there everyday that we were in Montreal.  The croissants are yummy and the bowl of cafe au lait is delish.

The staff is friendly and doesn't make you feel like a jerk for not speaking French.

Really lovely cafe.  I wish I had one just like it at home."}
{"text":"I must have walked passed this place a thousand times and it always looked nice, but this morning I was on the prowl for a nice cup of Joe and pastry and actually walked in...
I started on the terrace facing the street, but half way through my breakfast I moved inside because contraction activities on St. Denis drove me nuts. 
Inside it was warmer and there was soft music playing in the background.  You could still hear the street a bit through the open door but that was fine.  Saturday morning featured mostly people sitting by themselves with a laptop or a book and some couples talking in low voices. Really nice ambience. The decor is very inviting and kinda cool. 
As I sat down I immediately got a glass of water and a menu. The staff was bilingual and very friendly. 
I went for the $4.95 croque dejeuner and added +$1.75 for the large latte (I believe a small cafe is included in the breakfast combo).  It was pretty nice! good coffee, and an OK Croque-monsieur in a croissant (it was served warm but was unfortunately a bit cold in the middle).  
I wish they were a bit more considerate of the environment and didn't serve the yogurt in a disposable plastic bowl. 
It's a great place to spend a lazy weekend morning, and hopefully next summer there won't be construction on St. Denis so the balcony would be less dusty and more peaceful."}
{"text":"Un accomplissement assez tempéré, traduit sur une forme empressée et avenante. L'espace de cuisine à découvert décrit bien le commentaire spatial du lieu, soit chaleureux. 
L'exercise de fond brille par un café très juste. J'ai commandé un double allongé. Dosé avec suffisament de crema au dessus."}
{"text":"The coffee is good. They have lots of varieties to offer. If I was going to rate the place on coffee alone, I would probably give it five stars. Unfortunately there are other things I need to mention.

The food I've ordered there has been pretty boring. And my number one complaint... Service. Wow, you can sit there forever waiting for service. They are notoriously under staffed. The poor waitresses are running around completely incapable of keeping up. Maybe Marie & Marie could splurge a little and get another waitress on board."}
{"text":"Lovely place, tasty coffee! Got the Kenyan AA and the house blend espresso for home. Very flavourful!"}
{"text":"Je viens de passer un après midi de travaux de fin session à cet endroit et j'ai adoré mon expérience. Le choix de cafés, breuvages et salades, sandwichs et petites douceurs m'ont séduites immédiatement. La salade Calabrese est excellente avec un dosage parfait de vinaigrette au pesto et son mélange de verdure, tomates et bocconcini. Le décor est très joli et la terrasse donnant sur le soleil est très invitante. Le service est super et le personnel très souriant et agréable. Je vous recommande fortement cet endroit pour passer un bon moment entre amis, pour étudier ou lire un bon livre dans une ambiance relaxante au rythme de la vie sur la rue St-Denis"}
{"text":"I love this quaint little European-styled café close to the Mount Royal subway station. The unusual and high quality teas are lovely. The coffee is brewed to perfection, the food is hearty and delicious and the service is consistently attentive while still allowing its patrons long expanses of time to chat with friends, read, write and daydream thankfully without interruption."}
{"text":"J'aime bien aller à ce petit café. Ils ont une belle sélection de cafés et de thés. Mes choix de prédilection sont le cacao Cappricio et le chaï-soya. Le service a été rapide et courtois. On se sentait chez soi. L'ambiance est très \"zen\"."}
{"text":"Visiting from New York. Came here twice as it was nearby to where we were staying. They have a welcoming staff, wonderful quiche and it's all made with love. (:"}
{"text":"Un café qui en est vraiment un! Très bon choix et odeur imprenable. L'intérieur est feutré et agréable bien que les chaises laissent assurément à désirer. 

Il n'y a pas de prises de courant, ou au maximum, une seule. 

L'été la terrasse bonifie énormément l'endroit. 

Un café idéal pour y passer manger ou jaser."}
{"text":"They use a pre-cooked omelette and then fill it with whatever. I repeat, a pre-cooked omelette! Worse than McDonalds. Coffee is ok, not worth it."}
