{"text":"This impressive \"Cultural Geschaft\" lies right in the heartland of Calgary.  About as good as you can get for atmosphere and service. Features a Bakerai, Cafe, and Delkatessen.  Check out the quality imported gifts as well.  \"Deise Speiselokal ist Ganz Gut!\"."}
{"text":"Very well selected bakery and deli. Small coffee shop, with excellent lunch specials. There is also a store in the same building, with a good selection of both kitschy and quality European products."}
{"text":"Edelweiss Village is a treasure to explore! Any sort of obscure German, Polish, Dutch or Scandinavian delight... they have it!  Personally I adore shopping for condiments (such as mustards) here... but there is something for everyone. Imported chocolates, sweets, novelties, drinks, mixes, seasonings, crackers/flatbreads... a wonderland.  Edelweiss Village has, in its building, a deli, bakery, and cafe. The sausages, cheese, and breads are highly recommended. Really, everything is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Edelweiss has just about anything European you need. The place even smells like Europe. They have teas to kitchenware to specialty chocolates to a deli to a side restaurant. The place has everything and not all of it will break your bank account. The teas, imported from Europe, are relatively cheap and the food is fantastic. Sausage, kraut, roast chicken, etc, etc. They even have a special Christmas section now that includes an old fashioned advent calendar as well as traditional European ornaments and treats. The authentic beer steins caught my eye, but they are so real and made of quality that they'll run you well over $100. They really do have everything. Their cheese selection is extensive, featuring a lot of things you couldn't find anywhere else in town or this country. The guy who came up to ask me if I was finding everything even spoke with a European accent. I believe it's authentic.... Anyway, this place is fantastic and worth a visit even if you have to make a long drive."}
{"text":"Service here is awful. I came here with my parents only to experience rude staff who rolled their eyes at my parents in front of me when they had some trouble deciding what they wanted. My dad has trouble hearing so some patience would have been appreciated. As I waited for my food and ate my lunch, I watched the staff scolding people for not standing in the right place. Not one of them smiled. It's not the customer's fault for disorganized and inefficient line ups for ordering and paying.   With that all said, the food is delicious with good portion sizes. Wish they would have warmed up the food a little more but I can deal with that."}
{"text":"Located in the NW part of town, not too far from the core is Edelweiss Village featuring Ukrainian, Scandinavian and Bavarian food and goodies.  It was recommended to me because I didn't know too much about the area when I recently moved and this was mentioned as a must!  Needless to say, this place has turned in to a regular for me.   Their perogies are one of the best that I've had in the city! They're chewy and doughy, perfect with a bit of sour cream. They also serve a wide array of desserts, which are all displayed right up front, it's hard not to grab one to go or even to enjoy in their small homey cafeteria.  The portion sizes are always generous with lots of selection from bratwursts to cabbage rolls. This is definitely my go to place for a quick European bite!  I also tend to stop by to pick up European goods that I miss so much from my travels. Just recently I found Speculoos cookies! They've always reminded me of Europe and I was so excited to have found them there. Now if only I can convince them to carry European butter!"}
{"text":"This place is a great idea--charming exterior, lots of kitschy goodies and imports, delicious dessert pastries, plenty of delectable choices in the deli case, and an incredibly cute seating area to sit down and eat away at your European meal of choice.  I will never pass up schnitzel if I see it on a menu, and my mother had gone with a sausage plate.  Her sausages were delicious, though I found my pork and schnitzel were a little on the bland side and a little tough.  I did however enjoy my giant serving of sauerkraut and potatoes, so yes, all is right with the world.  It was pretty busy when I went in there at about 1pm, but I actually didn't have to wait long in the lineup at all, and we found a great window seat right away.  As for the other side of the building, which houses the service cases and a huge selection of imported products, I have to say I had a lot of fun perusing their items and left happy with my purchases.  Giant box of Mozartkugel? Check.  Kartoffelland Knödel? Check.  Hagelslag for my morning toast? Bless the Dutch, and check.  All that was missing was for me to have enough money to realistically buy one of those awesome bier steins or a gorgeous handmade cuckoo clock on the amazing wall display. All in all, definitely check this place out for a tiny taste of Europe in Calgary!"}
{"text":"This place is great, I remember when they were located in Brent wood Mall. This place has it all, from great German Sausage to European Gifts and products. I found some Cd's from my Mom and Dad's favourite German Language singer here also. My wife has also come to love this place. She always sums it up with \"I Love German food\" when we go here for lunch. whether it's cold cuts and cheese or Bratwurst and Sauerkraut. You can get it here!"}
{"text":"It's a tradition. We come here for lunch or a snack. The kids like the bratwurst and potatoes. The combo plates and soups are always very tasty. I let the kids pick an imported soda, which is always fun. Good coffee too.    Sometimes we buy deli goods to take home...reminders of childhood imports sent from relatives in the Netherlands (Droste chocolates, Christmas decorations, salty liquorice). Calendars for Oma from the Alps. And so much more."}
{"text":"The staff was incredibly friendly, and the selection is amazing. Being of Polish heritage, I was excited to see products directly from Poland, and I was even more excited to see treats from Austria that I haven't been able to find since returning from Europe. I purchased some deli meats and plum cake, and I found the prices to be on the high side (in comparison with The Italian Store and Lina's Italian Market), but I had lunch in the cafe, and it was perfect.   While I might not come back for deli meats and cheeses, I will definitely consider coming back for lunch or coffee."}
{"text":"We traveled to Germany and Austria this spring and were looking for food from our holidays. How sad it is in NW, and we are from SE. we could have come here more often if it is nearby. We love the imported cold cut, cheese, all the goodies. Must try their hot food and European baking goods !!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff are friendly and the food (especially the desserts) are tasty. At the cafe, we love the schnitzel, salads, soups, cabbage rolls, perogies and cakes and pastries. Tastes just like my Oma used to make. We also buy sandwich meats from the deli like schnickenbrecken and sommer sausage. The store also had lots of interesting gift ideas from European trinkets, to kitchenware, to European sauces and spreads, and freshly baked breads. We come here often and would definitely recommend the edelweiss to our friends."}
{"text":"Excellent selection. Great variety of sundries groceries, meats & full meals.  There is a lot here I would consider more European than just strictly German and that's great.  The staff has always been great & helpful.  Pricing I find a bit high but none the less still well worth it whether you're looking for that something different or that familiar comfort food/item."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. What a fantastic variety of European products, and the deli is really more of a mini restaurant. The variety of European products, predominantly German, is what makes this store so great. It's not simply a grocery store, they have home decor, a wall of cuckoo clocks, giftware, kitchen stuff, the list goes on.  The only negative thing I'd have to say is that the parking situation can be a bit difficult, avoid weekends if you can. It's also a bit difficult to get in and out of the parking lot depending on traffic. But if you can come during a weekday, avoiding lunch time, it's MUCH better."}
{"text":"Here it comes, a German writing a review about a German business in Canada! Okay, it's not solely German, more European, but I'd say mainly German.   They do have a lot of imported German, Dutch, Polish and Scandinavian food, so if you are planning on making a special dish or just craving some special food from this region there is a good chance you will find it here, at a high price though, which is okay because it is imported. Okay for most of the things, selling Nivea Deodorant that is available at so many stores in Calgary for twice as much is not okay in my opinion, but I don't want to get lost in details.   In case you were not able to bring back the German clock your grandma keeps talking about, because your suitcase was already stuffed with beer mugs, you will find one at this place. They not only have food but lots of other stuff, like magazines, books, music, videos... go check it out!  They have a café as well and sell home cooked food, so we had dinner there. The roulade was good, the red cabbage is okay (not the best but not bad either), the potato salad is very plain and has nothing in common with the German one except for the potatoes. They serve it warm; I never had or heard of warm potato salad before. And it just tastes very different and not good (at least to me). The beef and barley soup was good, but you had to search for the beef. The spicy Bratwurst tasted more like the German \"Mortadella\" with lots of spices, but not like a Bratwurst.  For dessert we got some cake, apple strudel and a poppy seed cheesecake, 6 bucks a piece! The apple strudel was a thin slice and it just wasn't good, at all. And it tasted old as well. The cheesecake was better. They make it with \"Quark\" which to me is the real cheesecake, so I was very happy about that. The taste is good in general, but it had an odd taste to it, which sometimes can come from the poppy seeds I think. This piece was a decent size. But I still think that 12 bucks for two pieces of cake (not a big fancy one) to take home is just too much.   To sum it up: they have a big and good range of products, just stock up your wallet a bit more before you go there. The food they cook/bake themselves was a little disappointing to me, but I am not saying \"don't go there\"! Go check it out and decide for yourself, because a lot of people like it a lot.  I will probably go there again to get specific things, but I am most likely not going to be a regular customer, as much as I would have liked that..."}
{"text":"My top inspiration for that perfect balance between gourmet and gourmand.   There are about a million things to peruse in this Fairy Tale-esque building; I could spend countless happy hours checking out everything from what has proven to be the TASTIEST bacon I've had in recent memory, to the beautifully intricate cuckoo clocks filling one wall.  The candy selection is of particular interest...no matter how much I tell myself I don't REALLY need anything...I always find something that I can't leave without.  I might want to start bringing a handkerchief to mop up the drool so I don't scare anyone off.   I've been going to this place since I was in Elementary school, and snuck off school grounds in Junior High to run over for a treat during my lunch break.   When I went in last time the owner was running the till with a welcoming smile and warm disposition, and she even remembered what grade I was when I first met her (some 17 odd years later)!  This place makes me feel all warm and tingly inside like I get at Christmas time; which come to think of it this place would be my top place to go for stocking stuffers.    The staff are patient, pleasant and never pushy; I've never felt like I'm annoying anyone in the slightest by approaching them with a question.  You should probably just stop reading this, grab your coat and go before I work my way through their entire inventory."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for a late lunch on Saturday. He had a cold-cut sandwich and loved it - gobbled it up quickly! My schnitzel with with red cabbage and potatoes was good. It was fun to browse the store - bakery, deli, grocery, household and gift items from Europe. It was like a little mini trip to Europe in Calgary!  This would be a fun place to bring kids since they have lots of treats, toys and adorable cuckoo clocks. If you ask, the kind staff will demo one for you! :-) They are expensive so no touching. This place is definately worth the visit for the sake of adventure. :-)"}
{"text":"We have gone here in years!   They have expanded from what I remember.  The place is busy, but the wait time is minimal.  Beautiful European souvenirs and collectibles, from clocks to wooden toys.  The European food selection is very large from cheese, deli meats, delicious pastries!!!   Oh, don't forget the hot food item such as red cabbage, roasted potatoes with sauce, rouladen, schnitzel with yummy gravy!!!!  This is a place to stop for the feel of European flare!  Now, parking can be shady at best.  Be patient people do come and go frequently so parking will come available.   I will be returning!!"}
{"text":"I have a new favourite place in town and it goes by the name of Edelweiss Village/Kaffe Stube.   Edelweiss is THE biggest German store in our city, and THE biggest I've ever seen. They've got everything from German chocolate to German tabloids. They specialize in German imports and a visit is more of an experience than a shopping trip.   To add to their unparalleled selection of German goods, they have an in-store restaurant where you can eat cabbage rolls, Bratwurst and Schnitzel to your heart's content. They even have a vegetarian menu!!! Oh, and don't even get me started on their desserts. Seriously, just lock me in overnight with nothing but a fork.   My words can't possibly do Kaffe Stube justice, so I took a whack load of pictures so you can get an idea of what a jaw-dropping experience it is.   Honestly - Edelweiss Village is my absolute favourite Calgary discovery so far!  Picture time - see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Expected more from a German restaurant. Not that good at all. The Schnitzel was tough and dry, the Rouladen was bland, but the worst was the warm potato salad. The only thing I liked is the Sauerkraut -quite authentic.   The store is awesome and full of everything you can imagine, fair prices and first class assortment of German imported goodies. Don't miss the sweets section, the licorice are the best in town."}
{"text":"I really like going there for lunch. I order the Ukranian Diner which has a sausage & perogies. In my opinion they have the best perogies in the city. The food is alittle expenise and its far from my house, but that doesnt stop me from going there. They are not open on Sundays... learned that the hard whay."}
{"text":"This land is your land, this land is Dutch land!   I don't have any more incredibly mind blowing lyrics to go along with Edelweiss Village, but this place is sweet!   The grocery store section has tons of European speciality foods. Just tons and tons of great things, top picks:  1. Sour Cream Curry Dip 2. Curry Ketchup 3. All the Cheese!!!!  I love cheese!  This is a really great place to check out, you will probably find something you will enjoy.  I have not yet tried any of the food in the restaurant, but next time I am there...sorry I spaced out due to over salivating."}
{"text":"This is a neat little European (German) grocery store.  It has all kind of goodies, the kind that you cannot get in an ordinary grocery store.  As soon as I walked into the store, it has an European feel to it.  The first thing I said to my friend who introduced me to this store \"it just feels like the grocery stores in Germany!\"  I love it!  They also have a little restaurant in the store, which sells schnitzels!  It's unfortunate that I have not had a chance to try it but for sure I will be back for more European grocery shopping and food.  It's a little wonderful place in the NW!"}
{"text":"Great slice of Germany/Europe in Calgary's northwest.  Good food and hard to find euro products: condiments, breads, cookies, chocolate, meats you name it.  Good place to have a fresh lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the Cakes!!  European style with fresh fruit and other fillings. Not as sweet as other cakes you can get locally, very refreshing!!"}
{"text":"The store is quite nice...lots of great imported products. Also the meat and desert section is worthy. Hence my 3 star rating. As for the restaurant, I'm not a fan at all, and this lowers my overall rating. It also confirms that a truly authentic German restaurant cannot be found anywhere in the city of Calgary.   Not sure why so many people seem to like the restaurant. Probably because they've never been to Germany. Very bland cafeteria style service. Nothing is made to order. That said, the schnitzel is dry and rubbery inside, and the breaded coating soggy. The potatoes were horrible, and like nothing I've ever experienced while living in and traveling Germany extensively. Hardly authentic. Why not serve bratkartoffeln??...this is the style of roasted potato dish you find all over Germany. Not the sloppy mush served up at Edelweiss. Though I suppose after sitting in a steam table insert pan for an hour, the bratkartoffeln would become dry, inedible, and portions would have to be discarded, ultimately costing Edelweiss $$.  So unfortunately for us, the only solution is to sell watery mushy potatoes that can withstand sitting under a slow heat for an extended period. Yuck.   It would've been nice to see other classic German dishes such as; Kassler, jagerschnitzel, kartoffelsalat, wiersingeintopf, sauerbraten & knodel, or even currywurst. But then again, due to the cafeteria style service, this would probably be a major failure as well.  On the other hand, the sauerkraut and rotkohl (braised red cabbage) was OK. However, if any of the other dishes were to be served in Germany, people would scoff, and more than likely walk out shaking their heads. The owners should be ashamed serving such sub-par food. I'm sure they know better. Apparently the average Calgarian doesn't, which is reflected within the majority of these 5 star reviews.   Even in the parking lots at OBI (a major German hardware chain similar to Home Depot), the currywurst stands have better food, not to mention the truck-stop diners found throughout Deutschland."}
{"text":"I have lunch here from time to time and its always great.  Newcomers should not be daunted by the incomprehensible ordering system/menu, wait in line, don't feel pressured ordering and you will be rewarded with very well prepared German fare, with different lunch specials everyday.  It is really amazing how fast you can get in and out here... about 25 minutes, taking your time!  This is not a dinner place, lunch only.  The other half of the place is a deli and a shop full of kitsch that doesn't really do anything for me.   But if that's your thing, this is the place for it."}
{"text":"Great deli/ store to find great European food and fair.  Also deli side also has a great lil restaurant where they serve great food. Down side is they often microwave things to reheat which I am not a fan of but food quality and quantity is great!"}
{"text":"Great perogies, and schnitzel! Great flavour in the pork perogi filling. They had 3 types of djon. This was my first time here, and the food was as good as the place looked. Nice European atmosphere, and decor. The only issues I had was that the food was not right out of the stove, but was cafeteria style (so I'm being picky in that regard). But it was good food. However the price was a little steep. 14$ for 3 perogies, a chicken schnitzel plus sour cream. Yikes!  The other part of the store had a cafe, and pastry area. I would like to try some of that before commenting. Then there is a store area that sells all sorts of European/German candy, chocolates, souvenirs etc. I'm just rating the food here."}
{"text":"This place looks exactly like my cute little old german grandmothers house! Ok, I don't have a cute little old german grandmother, but if I did, I would want her to live here. It's magical.  Housewares, kitchen ingredients, knick knacks, chocolates, fancy handcrafted village scene wooden cookoo clocks, and pretty much anything you can think of from the old country.  It was a cold day, and I went in for a delicious hot plate of cabbage rolls, mashed potatoes, sauerkraut , and bratwurst.  They really do make some fantastic comfort food. It's everything you need to feel all warm and happy on the inside and it tastes home cooked, just like my fictional german grandmonther used to make.   Served on dainty white ceramic plates with german pattern work around the outside, eating at a table with a crochet table cloth, this restaurant market did everything to stir up the nostalgia in me for a time and place that I hadn't ever experienced.   Eidelweiss Village is a great place to go if you are honestly looking for German products, for a down to earth home-cooked meal, or if you want to feel like a tourist in your own city."}
{"text":"I dropped in here for lunch and ordered the Oktoberfest platter.  The red cabbage was tangy and not too tart, and the scalloped potatoes were creamy with a smoky accent from the diced ham. The bratwurst was cooked to perfection. I wished that there were two of them on the platter; I'm a carnivore at heart!   There is a cozy little eating area here with paintings, prints, and antique clocks for sale.  To the right of the store is an excellent deli with imported cheeses, cold cuts, sausages, and pates. The bakery makes European pastries like cream puffs, cakes, strudel, croissants, and tortes.  There are also shelves of cookbooks, raclette and fondue sets, kitchen gadgets, mugs, and imported foods available."}
{"text":"excellent home-made german cooking.  They have plenty of extremely yummy imported items as well as important documentaries on the Nuremberg trials"}
{"text":"I adore the hot foods here, and the selection of hard to find specialty items. The one thing I'm not totally sold on is their pastries, and I'm a professional baker!!!They all seem to taste overwhelmingly of alcohol.  That being said, the cabbage rolls are AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing German/Polish eats. Homes made perogies are to die for. Huge selection of deli meats. The cabbage rolls are huge! The price is right."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. We are vacationing here visiting our daughter and son in law and new baby. I was looking for a German place to eat that was more than just a restaurant and found it all at Edelweiss The sausage and kraut was excellent just what we were craving. And then who could pass up dessert? Wonderful tall cakes and custards and I had the cherry cheesecake of course Then we shopped the aisles of gourmet candies from all over the world, soups, licorice, kitchen utensils, many kinds of mustards and jelly it was really my kind of place They have homemade bread in the bakery good cheeses lunchmeats and Canada souvenirs  I hope to go back there soon"}
{"text":"I always seem to forget about Edelweiss Village.  I never think to head there for lunch unless I'm literally a block away on my way to somewhere else - but this is the place you should definitely find yourself when you are hungry.  Good wholesome hearty and filling European/German food always puts an end to any hunger pains.  Today I just happened to be at a meeting at a jobsite down the road and realized afterwards that I missed lunch again and was hungry.  Hello Edelweiss.  I wanted something lighter than the full combo options and soup/sandwich combos and was delighted that I could build my own meal.  Medium spicy sausage, sauerkraut (2 kinds) and a few scalloped potatoes it was.  I didn't really need the latte they had advertised, but oh well, it was good.  After lunch I usually quickly browse through the food and etc. section in the store to see what's new or on sale - I didn't today as I was running late for another meeting, but I did notice some freaky yet \"buy me, I'm interesting\" garden gnomes that I've never seen before - next time...  If you are looking for great jams (imported and local) this is the spot.  Try the rosehip jam, trust me it's good.  They have a great selection of mustards too.  They have a deli, if that's your thing, and kitchen ware, knick knacks, books and assorted stuff like that.  You can even practice your German with the staff.  Be patient in the parking lot - the (\"older\") clientele make getting in and out a little interesting - let's leave it at that.  Try it, you'll like it.  M"}
{"text":"Did my first visit to this location this week. The building is attractive and so is the setup in the store. It seems like a typical European deli/bakery/shopping location. It was not a horrible experience, but I really found it was overpriced with poor customer service. We wanted to try some of the pastry and we were waiting for a long time while about 5 women behind the counter were talking to each other. With 5 people working and no one else in line I found this incredibly rude. I bough a poppyseed cake for $6 that was about 1/4 of the size of the exact same thing I got back home in Vancouver at another European bakery and it was not nearly as good.  Love the song, but not the shopping village. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Whenever I am missing Amsterdam I come here.  They have Stroopwaffles which I love and pastries to die for.  Silly things that remind me of my Austrian grandfather like coo coo clocks and hankies.  They have a nice restaurant and deli counter with a good selection of cheeses.   Lots of housewares and kitchen gadgets as well as a large selection of fine china and beer steins.   A bit of Bavaria in Calgary."}
{"text":"The apple crumble pie is to die for. Actually, every pastry is to die for. I have nothing negative to say about this place, it is perfection.  They have great hours, it doesn't close too early and it is open all week.  The staff is very friendly and attentive. The products are amazing and well priced for being home made! And you can dine in house or take it to go! They have an assortment of pastries and a little buffet of sausages and German food!  Overall this place is amazing and I commend the owner and the staff."}
{"text":"Very happy to have stumbled upon this place.  Really a great place to find the little things I miss in Europe (I am Czech).  I go weekly for bakery, pastries and kinedliky!  I only wish they could get Kofola!"}
{"text":"Had some deserts to go and they were yummy. A bit pricy but worth it. My friend and I had a Beinsestich Schnitten ($5.95), Apfelstrudel ($6.25), Beza ($5.50) and a Karpatka Dessert Slice ($6.25). The portions are quite big so we only shared 2 at once. They are puurrfect with some port :) The hot chocolate was great too. I liked the Apfelstrudel, the flavors just exploded in my mouth. It is a shame it got cold in the car. Anyhoo - Yummm!. I'd prob visit here again for the sweets. Prob end up w/ Type 2 diabetes. Well, worth it."}
{"text":"This place is a delight! Absolutely recommend it. They have everything from great coffee, deserts to sausages, I even bought my girlfriend a beautiful amber ring from there. I spent nearly an hour browsing around in the gift section of the store. Don't miss it"}
{"text":"Review #18 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  Driven past here many times.  Finally able to stop in during a treasure hunt but no time to browse.  So I bookmarked it with full intentions of returning one day soon since I am after all part German and the moment I walked in I felt like I need to put on my dirndl, grab a beer stein and start yelling prost to all my Freundens.  One day soon happened last week.  Hubs & I stopped in to satisfy my urge.  Parking was rather nasty however, the street was blocked off and so we opted to park across the street in a empty lot that hosts a Dentist's office since we were not planning on staying long.  But we were quickly chased away by some Dentist looking dude who came out yelling at us and shaking his fist (uptight?).  I could only imagine the patient left in the chair mid drill wondering where did my dentist go?  Prost I yelled back and waved as we drove away to find another spot to park.  We finally found a parking spot and got in.  Holy Busy.  The cafe was bustling, the deli counter crazy and people pouring in by the truckloads.  Apparently this best kept secret is not such a secret.     There is so much to look at I could have spent hours here.  Many memories came back as I wandered the aisles taking in as much as I could of all the European delights.  I further couldn't help but drool over all the food in the deli counters.    Since we'd already had lunch, we ended up picking up a Christmas gift for someone and vowing to come back one day and stay longer.  Lovely little place if you can find parking with something for everyone."}
{"text":"I went last week to Edelweiss for lunch with my husband and sisters in laws. I enjoy the home cooked foods here and after, I enjoy browsing and shopping for neat things here.  They have imported cuckoo clocks , beautiful Drinking steins, amazing Russian nesting dolls, awesome cooking tools, imported sport shirts & baseball caps, unique imported treats like cookies & candies, amazing deli choices, yummy cheese counter, and the most delicious dessert counter ever! The list goes on and on...  if you've never come here - go and experience the food and all the store has to offer! It's one of my fav places to visit in Calgary..."}
{"text":"This is an awesome stop for European goods.  You could browse the store for ages if you like trinkets and food.  There are some fantastic and unique gift ideas, particularly if you want to share a piece of Europe with someone who has never been there.  I drool a little when I see the desert cabinet and my biggest surprise of all was the Blackforest Torte.  A little pricey, but worth it.  I'm not a Black Forest cake fan, but this is the best I've ever had by far, as they make it with real sour cherries, fruit brandy and whipped cream.  I ordered just half of the torte and it was perfect.  Warning: the parking lot could be full if you don't go right when the store opens.  This can be a very busy place."}
{"text":"I do love coming here, it's my go to spot for German food. I love the red cabbage! Their Reuben is very good, just wish the bread was toasted. This last time I tried their cabbage roll.  It was huge and packed with filling! It also came with a bratwurst,sauerkraut, and potato salad which I switched out for red cabbage. I enjoyed it all, nice flavours. They had 3 different mustards to choose from and were a nice kick for the brat.  My only issue is my food is always barely above room temperature. The food is in steam trays but the food has always been nuked after they make the plate. So I'm not sure the steam trays are actually on.  As we all know microwaving food does a good job heating up the outside but if the item is dense, like a cabbage roll, the outside is hot and the inside room temp. I had to knock a star off for that.  The Budapest roll was wonderful! Sweet whipped cream with mandarins mixed in then rolled in a chocolate sponge cake dusted with sugar and almond slivers. A great way to finish off lunch!  I will be back, even with the tepid food issue because it still tastes yummy!"}
{"text":"Great selection of both packaged German foods, mustards, pickled vegetables, etc and of course cold cuts & sausages.  Prices are fair.  For the most part the staff are helpful and attentive to the customers (only exception is the one with the pink hair....always seems to be whining about something)."}
{"text":"I HATE YOU!  I HATE YOU EDELWEISS VILLAGE! I HATE YOUR DELICIOUS CLASSIC EUROPEAN PASTRIES WITH DEEP NOTES OF CHOCOLATE AND FRUIT AND LADEN WITH FRESH RICH WHIPPED CREAM!  I HATE THE ABSOLUTELY YUMMY EUROPEAN HOT DISHES LIKE SCHNITZEL AVAILABLE AT YOUR DELI!  AND WHAT I HATE YOU MOST OF ALL?  THAT YOU'RE CLOSED ON SUNDAYS AND STAT HOLIDAYS!!!!!  Phew... now that I got that rant out of my system.. one more quick addendum to my hatred....they're open on hours that gives me only a 1 hour overlap with my work hours. (Which gives me very little time when taking into account I would have to leave 15 min. into that time as I need to get to work!!)  Why do I hate Edelweiss Village with such a passion?  Because this place is simply a Bavarian Oom Pah Pah of awesomness and wonder!  If I could go here daily for a coffee (incidentally also awesome) and lunch a few times a week, I would!      The Village is a quaint jaunt into a classic Germany and eastern European land of delicacies and knick knacks of all sorts!  If you're looking for hard to find Polish cabbage rolls, Hungarian goulash, Czech sauces or unusual dried and frozen foods from the many regions of Deutschland, it's the best place in the city to find it.    Best of all, if you're actually FROM the old country, it's one of the best ways to keep in touch with it as well!  Plenty of tabloids, household tools and decor and touristy knick knacks are all over the place.    Now if they could also do something about the parking situation as well....  #53 of Yelp's 30-Day Review Challenge"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. I have been coming here for years and love it. It brings Europe to YYC all sort of candy and cookies from Germany and other parts of Europe. The food is great. Very tasty and well priced homemade food in comparison with mall franchise food. Tastes better and healthier. Also a great place to shop during Christmas  only downside it can be very busy."}
{"text":"We come here once a month. They have cute knick knacks but they are expensive. The food is great, but not cheap. We love the pierogies - they're 1.60 each with sour cream. Ukrainian Classic is also very good which comes with two pierogies. The chicken schnitzel is awesome but the potatoes are nothing amazing."}
{"text":"My family is all European but I've only spent a small amount of time there. This place is probably the closest you'll get to the same quality home made food you'd get over there. The schnitzel is amazing, their cabbage rolls are flavourful, and they have an amazing selection of cakes and deserts if not already full enough from all the food they give you for such a reasonable price. If I lived closer to this end of the city I'd be here everyday."}
