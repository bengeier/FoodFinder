{"text":"Was craving some noodles, so ended up here with my brother. Got seated quickly and served quite fast, but the store was pretty dead.

We both chose the Spicy Beef Noodles, and was pleasantly surprised with the hand-cut noodles. Very springy and good texture. The soup was pretty good, as it was actually spicy, but as my brother said: the spiciness overpowers the taste of the overall bowl of noodles.

Took quite a few times to get the server's attention to either get water or the bill, but they were actually doing something. So can't complain too much.

Overall good place, getting a solid 3."}
{"text":"This is a northern style Chinese food. The service is good. Order a mushroom and veg noodle and it is very average. I would give it another shot when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, when we first stumbled into this place I thought it would be bland and boring. I was pleasantly surprised! 

We ordered fried beef (or something like that) and beef noodle soup. You get mini apps that are flavourful and vary in texture , yum. Perfect flavours to get your eat on. Once we got out meal there were a variety of things that came along with the fried beef; stir fried veggies, soup, and rice. All equally great. Noodles themselves are really delicious. They are freshly made - chewy and satisfying. Soup and beef contents were ok, I'd order something else next time. Service was ok, our waitress wasn't very good at explaining any of the dishes to us. Over all I'd go back. Affordable, $10-15 per person."}
{"text":"This place is expensive when you compared to the quality and quantity of the dish. I ordered cup of lamb soup ??? (it says ??? on the menu, which is very misleading, as '?' stand for 'pot'. There is a huge difference between a 'pot' and a 'cup'. For small one $4.99 that comes in a cup, it has a lot of meat, which is great, but I expected a much bigger potion.  Similar type of restaurants would offer a small one in a bowl of soup enough for 2-3 people. The sweet and sour fish is battered fish soaked in a thickened paste of sweet and sour sauce!! OxO you can imagine how it would taste like. I trust that the Chinese food court inside the same plaza will do much better job for half the price.  The taste of the fry bean jelly ??? is actually pretty good, but you know what, when you added enough chili and soy sauce, it is almost impossible to make it taste bad. Overall, this is restaurant that is supposed to be specialized in noodles, but the variety of noodles is very limited; instead, they have wide selection of cold dishes, hot dishes, and other side dishes on the the menu. It looks to me that noodles at the Noodle House becomes secondary; more importantly, none of these dishes are presented anywhere close to appealing, they look awlful, it just doesn't really make sense to me. I will not go there again."}
{"text":"love the thick hand made noodles. Very Chewy . free appetizers which are very tasty but garlicky. must try the Szechuan noodles."}
{"text":"It's really hidden, never see a line up but there's always people inside. Usually families. I love spicy food and this place is really good in terms of quick eat. When I'm tired of eating pho, this is a great change. Not expensive either."}
{"text":"Kai Feng Fu Noodle House had replaced my favourite Korean restaurant in the plaza :( 

Being the adventourous self, me and my elite firend, Angelica L, of course had to give it a try.

Their special was their lamb soup soooo of course you always have to get their speciality. I wasn;t completely blown away. $7 for a bowl of noodle that I can finish, plus I finished my friend's.... What  a rip off! I wasn't even too hungry, if I was, I would've had to buy 2 bowls and that would've been a 14$ noodle meal.
Their lamb wasn't anything too impressive. I would say my favourite part would be the appetizers they serve complimentary before your meal and their thick home made noodles... You know it's home made since the thickness of the noodle is not consistent and you're eating one very veery very long noodle.

I wasn't overly thirsty after my meal, so at least I know it wasn't a bowl of MSG soup so I'll give points to that. I'm glad I tried it, but I wouldn't really come here all the time."}
{"text":"Kai Feng Fu Noodle House has $9.99 pint Amber draft beer and hand made noodle.. 
My kind of place!

Spicy enough to make my Yelp friend rolls his eyes.. 

My kind of place!

Machine Made Noodle with Chili Sauce ($5.99) has a nice flavour spicy and sour, that was quite addictive. 

Hand Made Longevity Noodles in Soup ($6.99) is a healthy option in a clear broth with fresh tomato slices, vegetables, mushroom and a poached  egg.  Noodle is thin and long, chewy and has a nice bite!

There are other unique offerings: Carp with Fried Noodles in Sweet and Sour Sauce ($19.99), Five Spice Lamb Tripe ($8.99), Lamb in Garlic Sauce ($9.99), Lamb Lung & Tripe Soup ($7.99)... Now I know why my Yelp friend got a little excited.

And why was he kept eating my spicy noodle?!"}
