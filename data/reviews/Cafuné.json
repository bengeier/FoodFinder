{"text":"This place has a great location and a cozy, inviting ambiance. It's a gorgeous space.  I guess our server wasn't having the best of days because she seemed annoyed by our arrival.  The menu is VERY limited. It's almost as if it's a café with desserts, finger foods and sandwiches and just happens to also offer a prix fixe dinner to appease.  I wanted to order the finger foods but the choices were too limited so I felt I had no choice but to take the prix fixe.  Appetizer: rice croquettes. Two two-bite-sized croquettes accompanied by a \"house hot sauce\" (oil and red pepper flakes). Very bland, nothing to write home about.  It took a good 20 minutes for me to get my main after I finished my appetizer and the restaurant wasn't even full.  Main: Escondidinho. I've had escondidinho in Brazil before and this was nothing like it. Authentic escondidinho has shredded meat in a rich gravy under the cassava layer. The one at Cafuné is made of dry, bland, plain ground beef with the odd pea and corn kernel. The portion is very small. If you are larger than petite you will still be hungry.  After about a half hour after I finished my main I had to ask for my dessert.  Dessert: pavê de limão. This was actually good.  The Guaraná Antarctica was awesome and they offer a nice selection of local beers.  I paid my bill with a debit card.  I would come back to have coffee or dessert but not for a meal. It's certainly not good value for your money."}
{"text":"Enchanting Brazilian coffee house with wonderful coffee and delectable Afro-Brazilian edibles, with a warm ambience and attentive, cheerful staff. Beautiful Brazilian art (which I believe is that of Brazilians living in Toronto) adorns the walls. An all-around beautiful Brazilian oasis in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Service excellent. Ambience great. But this was the worst meal I've had in Toronto. Just had the prix fixe dinner and it's comparable to plane food. My appetizer was cold. The tilapia was dry. The white rice was undercooked. And the cheesecake was dry to the point that I could barely make a dent in it with my spoon. My partner's appetizer and dinner portions were the same size. Best described as bite size.  Wouldn't be surprised if everything was made a month ago and microwaved. Feel so ripped off. Very disappointing as I'd like to support Cabbagetown/local restaurants."}
{"text":"Pour-over coffee is rich, patiently done, delicious.  Specials rotate and all are clever. Staff and owners are light, charming, clearly proud of their work. Portions aren't massive but prices aren't either, so it works out. Came for a lunch, would go back for the prix fixe."}
{"text":"They had a nice menu so I went back to re-review this place, this time with a guest, in hopes of giving a high rating. It offers Brazilian coffee/tea/snacks and $20 prix fixe which I am reviewing.  Pros: -food is generally good and tries to be upscale -good service -authentic Brazilian food, nice weekly menus -no mistakes this time -tea/coffee is good  Cons: -appetizers and desserts are hit-and-miss !-portions are just too small, and if you are a normal human you will leave hungry  3.5/5. Me/guest both agreed on 3 stars."}
{"text":"so affordable! we go here every weekend and get a sharing platter and a delicious almond croissant. The generous pots of Earl Grey tea make this place even more cozy. It's practically our second living room :)"}
{"text":"This is a reasonable little cafe, and a very welcome addition to the downtown Eastside/ Cabbagetown cafe scene."}
{"text":"Met a friend here a few weeks ago and immediately liked what I saw as I walked in. Greeted by smiling happy faces, it's a small spot but not crammed up and the large window facing the street adds a great seating location if you like people watching with your meal.  Neither of us were too hungry to sample any of their proper meal food but we got their tomato soup (featured as their soup of the day) and it was delcious and could have possibly been the best red tomato soup I've had, lots of chunky pieces and it tasted uber fresh and healthy. The furthest thing to a canned soup you could have.   I had a latte which came in a pretty large glass, I can only imagine how big their large sized latte is. It wasn't the best latte in the world but definitely good enough for me to consider Cafune for a coffee drink on the go if I'm in the area.   I will most definitely be back with an emptier stomach to try out a proper meal here since all signs point to a good experience awaiting me."}
{"text":"Update Jan. 28, 2014 -- The place seems to have have gone out of business.   Cute! Rustic, homey place. Portions seem quite small. $20 prix fix seems good value, but it's only three small portions. Live Latin jazz on Thursdays is very nice and mellow. Service was a bit scattered, but the place was packed including a table of 10. There's only the owner and 1 waiter serving. They were turning people away on Thursday at 7pm. This is a great new addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Yay for Cafune!  When I first heard about this place opening, I didn't know much about Brazilian coffee (yes, I'm not a foodie) but when I spoke with the owner and tried out the coffee at Cafune, I understand now!  They have only been open for two weeks and already they are packed.  It's a quiet little place on Carlton between Ontario and Bleeker where you can find free wifi and brazilian music, though they are festive right now, and meet with friends and enjoy cups of Java.   They have amazing prices and tasty food and even vegan treats... Their large Latte costs $3.50 (cheaper than starbucks and buy local :) cough cough) and it tastes great!  Their small menu will make sure I keep coming back to them for things they do right!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and chose their prix fixe which is very reasonable. It's $20 for a course menu and $25 with a glass of wine.  We tried their palmito salad, soup of the day and croquette. For mains, we trie their shrimp moqueca. I've had traditional Brazilian food so the moqueca was a bit blend for me but the cheese bread (pao de queijo) were very good.   The service was also very friendly and though they only have a small menu, their prix fixe menu seems to be changing all the time. Would go back next time to try their bauru sandwiches too."}
{"text":"Cute place!  Clean !! Good food. Unique and authentic.  Friendly service.  Just wish it was slightly cheaper...then I would go more often.  Got the lunch special and paid around $10 after tax and tips."}
