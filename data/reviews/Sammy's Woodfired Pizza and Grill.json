{"text":"I recently wrote a review and was not very pleased with the service and the changes to the menu. Well since then, I've been contacted by the GM and Corporate and I'm pleased they'll be handling the problems that may have been bringing the service down. Also, I'm pleased to inform everyone that they have now brought back some of the old favorites and can't wait to eat them!!! As for the GM Brandon, he should be the one to thank that I've decided to edit my post because that shows a lot of character and leadership to make the necessary changes in order to keep customers happy! I don't always need to be impressed with the quality food, but instead enjoy great service which everyone should get when visiting a local restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hit happy hour (4-6PM; $2 off beer and wine, 1/2 off all tapas) on a thursday.  Place was busy but had seating available.  We opted for the bar.

Ordered a couple of beers a piece, nice and cold with optional cold pint glass.  Limited selection, we had Peroni and Newcastle.  Food selections:  chicken lettuce wraps- on-point, my favorite item on the tapas menu;  kobe beef hummus- seems weird, and was a little, but tastey, and the flatbread they serve with it is good; lobster bisque- I did not try it but when asked how it was, described as \"lobster bisque.\"  So, seems like \"so-so\" to me.

Overall, good experience.  Good service.  We were watching the chefs and prep in the kitchen and they were tediously measuring out EVERYTHING- to the ounce.  So, you're going to get consistency here."}
{"text":"I'm a regular through McCarran and \"Sammy's\" was my go-to restaurant for many years. Well, things have changed. The Beach Nachos used to be made with real cheese, not anymore! Say hello to a $16.00 plate of chips with cheese sauce, no thanks. The new chef should be fired."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here just to try it out since everyone that we knew said it was good. He ordered the Mini Burgers (Kobe Beef) with fries which had 3 mini burgers. It was delicious! I ordered their pizza, it was good but just really oily. But the best thing of all is their mini duck tacos, they are so small and cute and oh so fantabulous! Totally recommend it. It comes with 6 mini tacos for only $9.95! 

Over all I've been here about 6 times and always try something new...
I recommend:
Mini duck tacos
Pastas are delicious (they are pretty big so you can actually share with someone) Shrimp with angel hair is my fav which is $14.95.
Lebni with flat bread is oh so mouth watering! Only $8.95 it's a great starter!
Kobe burger $10.95

I've tried more but wasn't a big fan like the mahi mahi tacos, not the best I've had! Lobster bisque is okay not the best I had!

Anyway, this place is really small but the staff is friendly and lots of parking!"}
{"text":"I go here because they offer a gluten free crust and vegan cheese. I usually get the arugula and pear Pizza, as well as the quinoa salad.  Both are delicious. I am subtracting one star because their servers don't always know what Vegan means. Also, the water they serve is absolutely disgusting. I've never tasted anything quite as bad. They say it goes thru a filter but I don't know. It seems so dirty."}
{"text":"Service is great and always with a smile. Big fan of both their salads and their pizzas. Try the Thai Chicken Salad - one of my favorites in town! Great happy hour with appetizer and wine specials. Ask for Jamie. Both of them are great!"}
{"text":"Empty airport at 11:30 pm on a Sunday. Ordered a pizza and was told it would be 15min plus wait. That was fine, I take a seat in the empty dining room to await my pizza and was asked to not sit at the empty tables and to wait outside of the restaurant. Seriously? I questioned them why and they said because you ordered to go. I then ask what if I change my order for here can I now please sit? No was his answer because I did not order at a table. I stepped outside trying to avoid further confrontation and As soon as I did I turn around and he is laughing and pointing at me to another employee. Seriously? I am a paying customer at a empty restaurant. So the next thing I know he invited a small group of also ordering to go inside to have a seat at the bar while they waited for their  food.  I'm am seriously disappointed. Decided it would be best to abandon the order as I was worried that the friendly staff may have done something to it as they made certain which order was mine and went back to the kitchen with it."}
{"text":"This has always been my favorite restaurant but they have changed the chicken  recipe on the balsamic chicken salad. The chicken used to be the best, now it's less than basic. Unfortunately I will need to find a new favorite salad or new restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our first time going and I will most definitely be back. We were sat promptly on a Saturday night and our server came right over. He was a very nice man probably in his late 40s. He explained menu options to us and we decided on the truffle fries and margarita pizza. The pizza had an amazing white garlic sauce and was full of flavor as were the fries. We both finished our meal comfortably full. Next thing we know our server is bringing over a monster of a nice cream Sunday. When we told him we hadn't ordered dessert he told us this was compliments of Sammy for our first visit. It was called the sloppy sundae. Oh my goodness it was amazing and we barely put a dent in it. The room was very comfortable and clean as well. Like I said, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly Sammy's is my go to spot when I need a relaxing local Vegas atmosphere! Food that you can pig out on or great selection of healthy eats. Duck tacos are an absolute must along with the Hawaiian Ono Tacos! If you are in a classic mood the NY pizza is a no brainer!"}
{"text":"dined here at the invitation of a great friend, who suggested it as a diversion from the expensive venues on or near the strip...this is a perfect spot for families, outdoor dining, and reasonable pricing...the food is excellent, and they have way more than pizza...but the pizza is excellent, as is there other Italian food...for those on a paleo diet, there are several option, so don't take this place lightly..."}
{"text":"Great location; pizza is good; service is frequently slow.  Although the food is always fresh, the menu could be improved.  It's hard describe exactly what the problem is, but it seems to come down to the offerings --- they're always a little too offbeat (exotic?) to be satisfying --- I would like to see more chicken, fish, and beef selections, and more traditional vegetables.  Also, the salad dressings are too acerbic (why no Ranch or Blue Cheese dressing?), and they could have a greater variety of salads."}
{"text":"Brought friends to enjoy a nice Friday night dinner. I was recommended to this place and went there last night. Food was alright but we were laughing and having a good time when they asked our party to keep quiet. We found out the lady who complained left before the bartender told us but still insisted we tone down our \"good\" time. We spent $140 in meals and drinks so we got up , paid our bill and we will never go to this place ever."}
{"text":"The duck taco's are amazing, THE best thing there. It's a little pricey and it's decorated like my aunts house from 1992, but otherwise a really nice experience."}
{"text":"The new menu is terrific!  We were on vacation and decided to try something other than the national chain -Chilis -which was next door.
Boy were we glad we did.  I had the Ono tacos with slaws which was very good.
Husband had the Brie & truffle oil pizza (with sautéed mushrooms).  Very popular with everyone and not at all heavy as you might think.  The crust was awesome!
The kids' meals were good also.  Our girl actually finished her pepperoni pizza!  Which is a feat in itself!
Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I come out every year for the WSOP along with my other associates. Keith has always been very assertive and very. accommodating to my needs and wants. I highly recommend this fantastic place for all your needs. I will return!!"}
{"text":"5 Stars for one reason only. The wood fired Mac & Cheese is amazing.  I go to Sammy's for this dish and this dish only.  My only complaint is the size.  I usually need to order 2 dishes to fill me up for a complete meal.  This is a must try for anyone who likes Mac & Cheese."}
{"text":"As I mentioned on my review for a different Sammys location the Mac & Cheese is a must get when you are here.  In fact you should get it if you are just driving by.  try it and let me know what you think."}
{"text":"The prosciutto pizza was good nor great. The beet salad was a little over dressed. The shrimp coconut skewers were fantastic. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"We came in 15 min before closing, so I expected the staff to be bitter. Not so. Our server was nice enough, and made a few jokes that were actually funny (not pity-laugh funny). We had the BBQ pizza as well. It was ok. A bit too much cilantro for my tastes. And the chicken was in giant chucks, which made for difficult eating. We shared a plate of hummus as well. The hummus itself was standard, but the pita bread was delicious. Herb rubbed I believe? Overall, nothing incredible, but a decent place."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of the duck tacos! Barbecue chicken pizza is worth the trip. Went two days in a row. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"We were in a few months back, in the bar area. The bartender Cher I believe was working. She said she wasn't the usual bartender, she was filling in. I don't know why she wouldn't be their regular bartender. She was fantastic. The bar got pretty busy as a large party came in and she still gave us stellar service while tending to everyone else.

The food here is always amazing. Everything is great. Never had a dish we didn't like. We have been into this location before and the other one before moving to it's new GV location. Taylor usually takes care of us when we are in this location (Sahara) and he is an outstanding bertender. Honestly we come back because of him....and the delicious food. But we really enjoyed meeting Cher and will probably dine in the restaurant next time so she can be our server. 

I hear their late night happy hour is a great deal. Nearly all the appetizers are half price! And the apps are pretty much al we order from. Big selection. Duck tacos, hummus, coconut shrimp, lobster bisque, etc. The pizzas are great too. Really like the options they have for gluten free and vegans. Open 24 hours with the full menu available. Just a great place!"}
{"text":"They would've gotten 5-stars, but because they gave me the regular pizza crust when I asked for the gluten free crust, and I didn't notice until I already consumed a bite, that's a big red flag for me.

1.  I asked for gluten free crust.
2. They delivered my pizza to me at my table.  I took a bite and immediately knew the texture was wrong.

HOWEVER, they handled it PERFECTLY!

First, they made sure I wasn't in imminent danger.  I'm not ALLERGIC, I'm intolerant...my stomach feels sick later, but I can still breathe and don't need an ER.  So, they did the right thing there.

Then, waiter accepted FULL responsibility.  They remade my pizza and they remade a fresh dish for my friend as well so that she didn't have to choose between eating without me or waiting and letting her dish get cold.  Good move!

Waiter was absolutely amazingly friendly and made our happy hour beverages himself (he used to be a bartender...my Mai Tai was DELICIOUS!)

They remade my pizza, with a gluten free crust, and they didn't charge me for it without me asking for them to take it off!

Basically, they messed up, but they made up for it in a big way, and I'm sure they learned a valuable lesson. I'm glad this happened to me and not someone who is deathly allergic to wheat, because that would've been a horrible experience for everyone involved.  I'm hoping the staff learned to be more attentive to dietary restrictions.

NOTE TO ALLERGY SUFFERERS:  Make sure you DOUBLE CHECK your order once you receive it and ask to speak with a manager.  This is true anywhere you go."}
{"text":"Best bartender is Taylor ... Who provides the best service & serves Amazing food.  Luv the Duck tacos, pizza and everything on the menu. This place Is not for the dull and boring..... this place is for great people to come and have a great time Lunch time or any time, open 24/7."}
{"text":"Good breakfast- Friendly bartender. Come here every time I go through this terminal. Good spot to stop and eat"}
{"text":"The food really is, just ok. Service is decent and environment is nice too. I wouldn't come here again"}
{"text":"the vegan menu is back and all is good in the world. Love coming here for the shishito peppers and baba ganoush. Thanks for listening, Sammy's!"}
{"text":"Totally love this CA chain! Went in not knowing what to expect and came out a convert. Didn't help that we told the waiter it was our first visit when we received the check and he brought us the \"Messy Sunday\"... gratis! A HUGE wine glass full of premium ice cream, overflowing with hot fudge, caramel, nuts whip cream and a cherry! I digress... back to the front of the meal. The salads were fantastic (quinoa and red beet salad) big enough to split. Combine with a thin,crispy, wood-fired pizza with fresh and innovative toppings and you have a great meal. Alot of the stuff is organic and you can taste the difference.

Went back for their tapas half-off happy hour and that was fun... the wok-fried peppers, garlic cheese bread, lettuce cups, tofu and beer came out to $21."}
{"text":"Im sort of amazed at how many 1 and 2 star reviews this place has. I have been here multiple times and have not had any problems with the service or the food. The wait staff has always been very friendly with us when we go and the ambiance is really laid back. 

I always order the same thing when I go. The pear and arugula pizza (I know it sounds weird but its soooo good) and the salted caramel pudding. Every time it has been just as good as the last and the pricing is not bad if you don't order alcohol.  For 2 people ordering a pizza with desert and Ice teas cost $28."}
{"text":"Our first time coming in was during an off time.  There were maybe 10 people dining at the time.  The pizzas are all made the same size - personal.  It's about the size of a small at most pizza chains.  They have some pretty interesting flavors for their pizzas which come in an original dough and flat bread style.  They also sell other things like pasta and salads but we were focused on the pizza.

My daughter ordered the mini cheeseburgers and fries.  The fries are AMAZING!  They use Old Bay spice and it's outstanding.  I ordered the Pesto pizza and added my wife had the goat cheese one.  Both of us loved our pizzas!  The waiter answered all our questions thoroughly and was very helpful.  He gets 5 stars for sure!

We'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok. Round 2 and the last round for me at this joke of an establishment. So from the get go, the wish-washy manager/host's confusion as to who to seat was an atrocity.   Next, it took 10 minutes after we sat down to even see our waiter. Now, I don't know about how the stations are ran/numbered, but 2 different times a runner or a manager would deliver food to which wasn't even ordered at our table.  The one time the runner just left the plate at the end of the table, left and asked the waiter who the food belonged too.  First of all, do the tables not have numbers on the receipts? The lack of professionalism AGAIN was disturbing. Now finally, we come to the check, where the half off happy hour tapas were YET AGAIN not marked down.  The service here has finally taken it's toll over the delicious food.  I'd rather make my own pb and j than endure the simpleton staff!"}
{"text":"Appalling service! Hostess and other employees were rude and completely ignored people waiting to be seated. Once seated, prices weren't provided and they weren't willing to confirm, so we went to Chili's instead ."}
{"text":"Wandered in here because everything was closing at 10 and it looked like they had comfy seats- and they did! I didn't have to wait long for service or food. The staff is courteous and didn't mind me hanging out and catching up on the Walking Dead. There's outlets under the bar ;) Loved the fries, wrap was okay (chicken too black, too much feta and olives). But the portions are like 2 meals in one and my check was only $11. This was one of my better airport dining experiences."}
{"text":"I love the food at Sammy's, but my overall experience here was very negative! 
I have been to the location on Sahara and the location at Rainbow and 215 and have never had bad service before.

When we first walked in, no one greeted us. It was a Thursday afternoon. About 5 tables inside and no one was on the patio because it was windy. We weren't sure if we should seat ourselves so we stood waiting. I looked at a few servers who passed us by but no one said anything to us. Finally a server told us we seat ourselves. So we asked to wait for a booth they had, it just needed to be clear of cups and trash. The busser literally took 10 minutes to come out. He was very kind, but slow. By now, I was ready to walk out because I work in the service industry. My family member told us we should just wait and see if it gets better so I agreed. We sit and wait yet again. The server didn't come until about another 5 minutes later. She asked if we needed menus. We said yes. So she left, then came back a few minutes later and handed us our menus. The manager was on the phone the whole time while this was going on by the way and looked at us, but did nothing. Our server didn't warmly greet us at all, but said a few words. She just stared at us, waiting for us to order. So I ordered our drinks. She came back with drinks, said nothing. Then asked if we're ready by saying \"Ready?\" So we decided to order right away after waiting 30 minutes with nothing yet accomplished. The weird thing is that when other people came in after us, the other servers were warm and friendly and actually seated them to the booths. My food came out semi-warm but I ate it anyway because we were starved. Not to metion we ordered my niece her food off the kids menu and asked if we could have her milk after she ate because then she won't eat. The waitress said it doesn't come with a drink and I lifted up the kid's menu to show her. She just stared at us, so I said nevermind. It was really weird. I've ordered take-out a few weeks ago and the hostess treated me better than our server. I always look out for good service because I am a server myself. I would have told the manager at this location about our experience but he was nowhere to be found.

Was very disappointed. Place seemed very unorganized, staff-wise."}
{"text":"We have a private party at Sammy's and the service, food, & atmosphere were all great at the Flamingo location!

The server was pleasant & helpful! We sat on the patio outside, it was comfortable & clean. The food was terrific! The tropical tea & Kobe sliders are by far my favorite menu items! 

It's a good choice for dining. We'll defiantly return & next time I'll try some of the bars selections."}
{"text":"They have the best asparagus in the world just sad they took them off the menu!! Please bring back!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but they charged my credit card twice for the tune of almost $100.00!  Still awaiting information on what the erroneous $71.00 hold on my account is all about."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husbands aunt took us here about a month ago for lunch. I have eaten here many times but this time was much better than any other time not sure if they have changes staff or what but the service was awesome!!!! And the food was delicious, we had caesar salad and pizza but the had everything cone out when it was suppose to and you weren't waiting to tell the waiter for a new drink, it was already on the table for us! I would definitely ear here again!!"}
{"text":"The Pizza is great but the service is really really bad. And they do not seem to care that the provide bad service. And when you think about it they don't have to. This is in the vegas airport and people come here because they are hungry, not because they want to go to Sammy's. Its a shame when good food is paired with bad service. But on the other hand, when you are eating at an airport, you are usually going to be in a hurry so how important is the service."}
{"text":"Here for lunch with coworkers, the place is packed and I only see two wait staff. Great, ugh! 

I ordered a Chinese Chicken salad. Much to my surprise it either had jalapeños or cayan in it because about two bites in my mouth was on fire! And guess what? Yup, no waiter for miles to refill my water. Also, the few pieces of chicken I found were so over cooked that it was like chewing sawdust. Blech...

I would say stick with the pizza it looked the most appetizing although no one at the table ordered it. Hhmm wonder why? Maybe it's not very good either...."}
{"text":"Not so happy, happy hour at Sammy's with the new, \"Happy bites\" happy hour menu. The new menu charges pretty much $3.00 for the majority of happy hour menu food items resulting in a significantly reduced portion compared to the previous happy hour menu. You essentially get two pieces of food with each order (ie- 2 meatballs, 2 duck Tacos, etc.) By the time you order enough food to fill you up, your bill is far more expensive than the previous happy hour menu was. The food and service are still very good but the portions and pricing are not. We'll be checking into happy hour alternatives and see what other options are out there...."}
{"text":"Kobe Burger was okay for the price. A little chewy. Service was very good. Ambiance pleasant considering a busy Las Vegas location  (McCarran)"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding, from the food to the service. The pizza is amazing. You have to try the duck tacos."}
{"text":"this place is a great late night hang out. their tapas are half-price after midnight and the drinks are spot on. we go there as a tattoo shop all the time and we love this place."}
{"text":"What a great breakfast pizza.  Exactly what we needed on our way out of town.  Anytime you can have a wood fired pizza you know you are having a great day!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a weekday for lunch. 
We were seated promptly. There was no wait.
The dining room was three quarters empty.
It has little decor and ambiance. Very plain. Nothing special to speak of.
There's a mix of tables and booths, and bar seating.
 
Our server, Alexandra B., came to the table fairly quickly. She asked if we'd like drinks. Husband ordered water. and I asked for water, a glass of Leaping Horse chardonnay, and a side of ice. My wine was $6.50 a glass and was very good. Full flavored and very drinkable. Alexandra forgot to bring my side of ice. I had to ask her for it again.

 We were expecting that a place that has \"pizza\" in their name would have a bigger array of pizza and do pizza well. We had visions of sharing a big \"Supreme\" pizza and taking some home. Not possible at Sammy's. They only have individual pizzas. So with our dreams of sharing a Supreme pizza and having great leftovers for the next day squashed, my husband ordered an \"Italian\" personal pizza which had pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms on it. You get one big piece of pepperoni on each \"slice\" of pizza. The mushrooms were very sparse. Hubby said it needed more of them. He said the pizza was \"fair\".

I ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad. It looked beautiful. I was happy, seeing this bright, beautiful salad with its array of vegetables including the surprise of green bell pepper, which you don't often see in this type of salad. 
However, with my first bite, I was disappointed. The dressing that was tossed throughout the salad was bland, boring, and didn't have enough Asian flavors.
One of the great things about this salad, if done right, is the tangy, full-of-flavor Asian dressing on it. Flavors of soy and ginger are usually in the forefront.
Not so with this one. It tasted like oil and vinegar and not much else. I think I detected a hint of soy and less so, ginger, but I'm not sure.
I had to look hard to find the chicken. there were a few unevenly sized pieces throughout, some of them a little too charred, with black areas covering a big part of a few pieces. The chicken was also dry. I ate four or five bites and just couldn't eat anymore. It was pretty tasteless.

We ordered dessert. Hubby decided on the Messy Sundae. Our server said it was \"big enough for four people\". He decided to try it anyway. The sundae was pretty \"monster\". It was big but would it feed four? Depending upon how much lunch you ate, and what your appetite is like, it might. I'd describe it as \"feeds 1-4\".
It came served in a tall glass goblet  and was filled with vanilla ice cream, and had chocolate sauce not only all over the ice cream but on the saucer that the goblet was on. It was topped with walnuts and a large amount of whipped cream. There were more walnuts in the chocolate sauce on the plate. Hubby really enjoyed the sundae.
I decided to try the Caramel Pudding since I love caramel. It was served in a small wine glass and the pudding filled the glass halfway. It was topped with a small amount of whipped cream. The pudding was creamy and rich and full of caramel flavor. The only thing that would've improved it was if there had been more of it! I really enjoyed it.

Alexandra was cheerful, efficient, and checked back on us a couple of times.  

To sum up, we were not impressed with our entrees at all. We know of several other places that do pizza, and Chinese Chicken Salad, much better than this. Sammy's is a 20 min drive from home. We wouldn't come back here again unless we happened to be in the neighborhood already, and then we would stop in for just dessert and a glass of chardonnay. :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere here, its clean and friendly staff, the food and adult beverages are a hit and miss, i do like the serving sizes"}
{"text":"Cheaper then grimaldies but just as good. Always have sales on their wines and drinks. I went in one night late and next thing I knee was that I was the last ones in the place and the waiter was super nice and didn't rush us. Felt bad so we left a nice tip!"}
{"text":"Worst service. Worst food. Don't go!! Never!!!

None of the servers were ready to help us..they kept on avoiding us and were not even listening.  we had awesome time in Vegas but this last experience on the airport was worst. 

Is you're having a good time, don't go here to spoil it."}
{"text":"I had the most fabulous To-Go experience last night at this location. I placed my order, sat at the bar and enjoyed an excellent glass of the manager's special-Jacob's Creek Chardonnay. It was perfect: the glass was chilled and the wine was dry and fruity, excellent! I requested bread and crackers to enjoy with my wine, while waiting for me order. The food was prepared so quickly and perfectly. I will definitely return this location more often. The staff was so friendly, helpful, welcoming and wonderful! The perfect way to end a long day of work. The food: Chinese Chicken Salad and Barbacoa Tacos were excellent as well. The salad was loaded with soo many goodies. Especially loved the crunchy bell peppers throughout the salad. KEEP IT UP-EXCELLENT RESTAURANT, SERVICE AND AMBIANCE!"}
{"text":"the lobster mac and cheese is incredible!  Delish! Not enough for more than one person,  but perfect if you just want a little/small lunch or snack... the flavors are excellent!"}
{"text":"We went to Sammy's for the first time on Thursday. The lunch rush was intense but the establishment itself is not rather big. We did not have to wait long to be seated though. The manager on duty was awesome, all the staff were awesome but the manager particularly. She gave us some great pizza recommendations and even comped us a signature dessert item, the \"Messy Sunday.\" which is a must try.

Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"Picked up take out from Sammy's today.  It was pretty good.  It may have even been better if we had eaten in the restaurant because the pizza did sit for awhile and the salads were in plastic containers.

The pizza really reminds of CPK.  Same small pizza and similar flavors.  We had the Margharita and Pepperoni pizza.  The dough had a good taste which is important to me.

The salads were ok- like I said probably better in the restaurant.  The hummus was delicious, but the flatbread was a little dry.

I ordered the donuts and they looked fantastic, but I did not get to try them.

The restaurant is cute, the servers were nice."}
{"text":"Greek salad is the bomb. Inexpensive compared to a lot in the airport and the thing is filled with goodness. Almost vegan except the cheese.Large portion and extremely tasty. Staff is friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Although this place can be a little pricey, I have a somewhat understanding why. I read over the menu and it's not like they use mediocre ingredients. The menu is chockful of high grade cheeses and pizza toppings. Even the non-pizza stuff sounded wonderful.
Tonight I opted for my favorite Chicken Tequila Fettuccine and the wood fired Sun Dried Tomato pizza with goat cheese, pine nuts and basil.
The Chicken Tequila Fettuccine is wonderful! The spinach pasta is delicious and the chicken is tender. It's tossed with red onions and peppers which adds a nice touch to the yummy dish. The menu shows jalapeno but the dish is not spicy at all (I can't complain since I'm no spice fan). Even though it was take out, I still got a good amount of food.
The Sun Dried Tomato pizza was delicious as well. Between the 2 dishes I preferred the pasta, but the pizza was good too. The sun dried tomatoes gave each bite a tangy twist while the goat cheese gave it a creamy touch. My only gripe was that the pizza was kinda small and it was only offered in one size. So if you're looking for giant pizza slices, this definitely isn't the place for you.
Overall my taste buds enjoyed the food. As for the service, although I stood at the door waiting for service for 3 awkward minutes, when I finally was told to place my order at the bar, the host was super friendly. He even offered me a beverage while I was waiting. I'm definitely coming back to this place, to dine in and/or take out."}
{"text":"Stopped in today with my husband and daughter for lunch after a morning work out because In laws recommended it ,we asked to sit outside beautiful weather and very nice host . Pizza was good ,salads are bland and kids meal was cold,chocolate milk looks like it's made with water  . Our server was polite but didn't see much of her . Outside got seated quickly a women training a server walked around and filled everyone's cup of waters except for our table which I found to be rude .We are always great tippers because I'm a sever my self and service could have been better ,will most likely not be returning back"}
{"text":"The pizza was nice and thin and the lo mein noodles were a perfect blend of fusion. Bonus points for cotton candy on the desert menu. Sometimes you just want candy to stick to your fingers"}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday for lunch. Ordered hummus and pita to start, pretty yummy. Had the grilled mahi tacos and the lettuce and salsa was all that you taste. Very little mahi mahi. I was bummed because I ordered these in the past and I don't remember them being stuffed with all that lettuce. Seriously, not very good. My daughter ordered the cheese pizza. She told me it was spicy. At first I didn't believe her, so I tried it.  To my shock, the pizza sauce was spicy. A little odd for a kids pizza. I'll return, I'll just order differently."}
{"text":"Out of town family went here because the reviews were decent and they had gluten-free pizza.  My wife has tried many gluten-free pizzas and felt like this one was decent especially since they had a good selection of toppings and they were cooked well.

Overall, we found it to be a good family-oriented dining experience with good service."}
{"text":"Keith gave absolutely excellent service on my visit to this awesomeness late night happy hour location!! Would recommend going to Sammy's at any time for great bar and/or food service! Looking forward to another late night after work hang out and visit session soon. Keith , you Rock !!!"}
{"text":"Horrible breakfast. Leathery eggs, razor-thin soggy bacon, COLD breakfast potatoes and only one slice of barely-singed toast. Staff was lackluster and kept forgetting items. Maybe their pizza is OK, but best avoided for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place has a unique gourmet menu.  My kids said the cheese pizza tasted like cardboard."}
{"text":"At first glance, Sammy's Woodfired Pizza looks like any other dining establishment in Las Vegas that's not located on The Strip. But don't let the name or the exterior fool you, this upscale pizza eatery offers an array of culinary delights that tantalize and provoke your taste buds to want more. 

I've eaten at Sammy's on several occasions and continue to go back to try various items on the menus that range from tapas to custom, hand-made pizzas to pastas, salads and to-die-for desserts.  This is definitely a good place to go with friends and split multiple dishes. For starters, try the Mini Duck Tacos, which are garnished with feta, fresh diced tomatoes shredded cabbage and a thick sauce flavored with cilantro. The sauce is pretty creamy, so if you're not a fan of rich things, you should probably shoot for the Pork Dumplings, which are meaty, but light with a thin ponzu chili dipping sauce. 

Another good starter are the Parmesan Crusted Artichokes, which are artichokes lightly dusted with Parmesan cheese to form a thin crust then sprinkled with goat cheese and accompanied by an herb dressing. For an entrée, I'd suggest splitting pizza and a salad with a friend. As far as pizza flavors go, Sammy's offers something to please everyone's palette.

For meat lovers the LaDou's Barbeque Chicken is quite delicious especially if you're a cilantro lover. The Goat Cheese pizza is great for those who are trying to lighten their fare. There's also the Artisan Thin Crust pizzas that includes the Yummy Honey Cheese, my absolute favorite, which is a very thin and flaky pastry with savory oregano melded with crumbled sheep's milk cheese and honey.

All woodfired pizzas can be made with gluten-free or whole wheat crust as well as nonfat mozzarella or vegan cheese for an extra cost. 

As far as salad's go, the Caesar is always a great go to and it's not drenched in dressing, which is a plus especially after all of the decadence you've already consumed. But the Original Chopped Chicken salad is also delicious with tart red wine vinaigrette.

If pizza's not your style, and you're looking for a healthier option get the Oak Roasted Chicken Breast, that comes with fingerling potatoes, asparagus and pine nuts - it's a clean, refreshing entrée that will fill your belly while keeping your waistline cinched. A not-so-healthy entrée option is the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine that has large chunks of bell peppers and red onions, all tossed in a cream sauce made of tequila and lime. 

If you're flying solo, simply pull up a stool at the bar, as the staff is more than appreciative and willing to assist you as well as strike up conversation. Plus, you get a great view of the chefs in the kitchen working the magic of your meal.

Sammy's also caters to large groups by combining tables although the patio is a great option in the spring or fall when the weather is perfect enough to enjoy a glass of wine in the sunshine. With a great selection of wines and a few beers, this pizza joint is anything but average and bring s a bit of class to the usual restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant and this location in particular is my favorite place to eat in the Las Vegas Area (that is since the closure of Quarks). The tapas are incredible. Being a registered Duck-a-holic, I am a huge fan of the duck tacos. I also enjoy the creative pizzas. The happy hour special can't be matched, half priced tapas, beer and wine from 4 to 6. 

Sammy's helped me out with a fundraiser dinner last year as well. They have an excellent community outreach program. They gave me fliers and a percentage of every meal served if they had a flier. It was raining and the staff together decided to allow all of the meals ordered into the percentage for my fundraiser. The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation was the recipient of their generosity."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch. Have to say the first thing I noticed were all the smiling faces; staff and patrons. I was greeted by a nice Asian lady who was patient with me since I had several questions about the menu. She recommended the new watermelon salad and boy did I not regret that decision. It was a great combination of flavor and textures. Absolutely refreshing in the summer heat of vegas. Sammys you now have a repeat customer"}
{"text":"Service has vastly improved. Staff is on top of it today. The pork dumplings were excellent. I had the Duck taco appetizer and it was better than ever. Hubby had the grilled mahi mahi tacos and were delicious this time, last time they were a bit dry. The portions were adequate. We're neighbors and this isn't always our first choice but that may be changing."}
{"text":"Hit a new Sammy's location on this trip to Vegas --- off of 215 in S Vegas -- don't know the name of the area. Food and service were just as good as the other 2 locations we've been to. Nice to be able to rely on consistency while on vacation with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Consistent quality in quiet surroundings.  Great salads and pizza for lunch or dinner and nice wine specials"}
{"text":"Waiting for our midnight flight, tired and hangry, we need food. This place smelled very good from the aisle, so we've come in to eat. It was either this or burger King, and I'm glad we chose this. The individual pizza was a perfect size for my sister and I to share, and it was a delightful pizza. We order the barbeque chicken with red onions and cilantro. The waitress was energetic and friendly and offered to assist us when she noticed us trying to take a selfie. The atmosphere is nice, they are all laughing and joking with each other, having fun. The decor is orange and cute. With a bit of wicker. I'm rambling now. Good place to eat."}
{"text":"Sammy's food was great once again.  It was a busy night and I called ahead for a table which saved us however the service wasn't so great.  So dinner was longer than expected but the sundae made it worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and the pizza is perfectly fine, but nothing special in my opinion.  If you like thick crust pizza, this is not the place for you, everything here is thin and crispy, which happens to be how I like it.  The toppings are fresh and flavorful, but sometimes I wish they would use more of them on the pizza.  The service here has been fine and helpful, and parking is easy as it's a private lot."}
{"text":"Don't eat here.  The pizza is weak.  We paid 27 bucks for 2 10\"  garbage pizzas"}
{"text":"Hello.  The food is good if you can get them to bring it to your table before it is cold.  I like their pizzas,  pasta can be soggy and wine is ok.  Few selections.
What I am in shock over is the lack of trained staff.  All sweet people but very slow.  They need a very experienced district manager or owner to provide a class on speed.  They often neglect the food that sits under heat lamps for a long time.  It doesn't seem to be an issue with the chefs but the lack of awareness and speed with wait staff. I have sat at the bar, table and to go orders.  I see a lot when at the bar.  I really hope they look into a class or better direction. If I see a change in wait staffs speed I will change my review to reflect that."}
{"text":"Had my two grand kids with me and wanted to grab something we all could enjoy. Ordered the sun dried tomato artisan pizza and I had the BBQ chicken pizza, we were hungry so I also ordered fried. everything was delicious.  the amount of sauce was just right, unlike other places that put so much sauce it overpowers the pizza. The sun dried tomato pizza was very flavorful with the goat cheese. this is good considering I am not a big goat cheese fan. the flavors seemed to be perfectly balanced. the grand kids loved the pepperoni. Even the fries were better than most. cooked in fresh oil and seasoned well, we really loved them."}
{"text":"Went to Sammy's on a Friday around 5 p.m. It wasn't too busy and was seated fairly quickly.  That's about it, no waiter ever came around to greet us, get our drinks or our order.  We waited about 15 minutes watching all the other tables get served except ours.  I will not ever come back to this place again! Poor Service."}
{"text":"Great establishment and a hidden gem. I drive more than 25 miles to get to this specific location because of the staff. Truthfully I have NEVER had a bad experience at Sammys."}
{"text":"Only come here if you have a full hour to be cussed out by the rudest staff in Vegas. We sat next to the wait station and heard the staff, including manager, talk trash about anyone who complained when the food took 40+minutes each. I was completely appalled by the service (minus Val, she was a gem). Beware of the drink prices, $15 Bloody Mary and $16 Irish coffee! It's an airport, 40 minute wait for food is bull!!!"}
{"text":"Don't bother with this place. Ugh. I went to the walk up counter so I could just take my food with me. I should have kept on walking. 

That was the WORST breakfast sandwich ever. I had mine in croissant. I disposed of the bread because it was awful. The eggs and bacon inside was not much better. Eggs are super salty, bacon is pathetic and the cheese was prob the best thing on it and I didn't eat it. 

The best thing about the meal was the fruit. That's the only reason I didn't give it one star. 

$15 for disgusting sandwich that I couldn't eat pretty much and $5 for coconut water. I should have just fasted but this is Vegas. Who knows when I'm gonna eat again? ;D"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places off strip. Good pizza and Mediterranean options. I love their lobster bisque and their hummus with garlic pita bread. Good selection of beers too."}
{"text":"Came to this location today,  i waited at front door a few minutes to be seated but no employees were to be seen,  so i walked over to cooks and asked if i was suppose to seat myself?  Then a girl came out from back and sat me at a table.  I saw a manager then come out from back and you could tell the girl told manager the situation and the manager rolled her eyes and laughed.  What kind of business is this?!  Very unprofessional,  no wonder there were only a few tables.  You would think a manager would come over and make sure everything was ok.  Food wasn't very fresh and i felt like i was a bother.  Definitely won't be back"}
{"text":"This location is great!  Wasn't going to give Sammy's another shot after poor service at rainbow location but a friend wanted to meet up here.  So glad I decided to come here!  Great service and manager Jon is very personable!"}
{"text":"Nice place for what a pizza place has to offer.

$8.95 for a Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad (that can feed 2 if your ordering pizza etc.) You can get the $14.95 plate. Maybe that feeds 4?

$9.95 for the Margherita: Roma Tomatoes, Garlic, Fresh Basil.
Tasty good. Asked for extra garlic didn't seem to make it on this order. Or it could be the Garlic Cheese Bread ($5.95) was head & shoulders more \"garlicy\" so the pizza paled in comparison?

Before, I have tasted some left over Thai Chicken pizza that was in the fridge at home, it was very tasty. Will try it fresh out the oven eventually.

 The Messy Sundae ($8.50)
My visit was for a B-Day. (FREE they said on B-Day) 
This is a Very Tall (stands what looked like 1-1/2 ft.) sundae glass cascading with chocolate over a couple of scoops of icecream.
It was fine finish to the stay!

Mixed bag as far as customers go, the retired, the first date, the small family, even a table of kids babysitting themselves. 

Kids Menu available.

Wait staff is on it. 
Lets call this a Pizza Restaurant with polished details and an upscale menu. Check it out. 3 other Las Vegas location with another opening soon S.Rainbow. And 10 more in SoCal.

Only thing I noticed, at least for this time of year, the Sun crashes through the windows from off to the left. So be aware. They have blinds but I noticed that those annoying little streaks still get through for some time.

I'll check it out again and get better layout details. for ya'all.

Back again.

Kids wars. Cell Phone wars. wtf!?
Salad was nice again.
Thia Chicken Pizza was good indeed.
Of all things to order someone got a Pepperoni. Looked like shit. Kinda pooled up some oil. Yay, lunch tomorrow. 

I guess if you stick with things that you can't get at Pizza Hut your ok here. Duck Tacos for one.........next time, next time"}
{"text":"This was a mediocre meal. The service was ok and so was the food. It was just an average meal."}
{"text":"After a long day of work I come hear to unwind, great service, very nice people and the food is very good."}
{"text":"Sat here for over an hour with no order. Not sure if they understand the primary purpose of the airport is to travel and on-time. Go here if you have all day"}
{"text":"Sammy's at W. Sahara has great food, great service, and a great atmosphere!  This is the place to go if you want the ultimate restaurant experience! It also has the best happy hour in town consisting of half off ALL liquor, beer wine, and apps! 4-6 everyday and 12-8am in the Bar.  Definitely a must if ever in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"No idea how the food here is. The apathetic hostess informed us that they were out of pizza, before we sat down, so we passed. It says \"Pizza\" in their name, and they ran out.  Why would I risk eating food at a place that doesn't even care enough to have their marquee items available? I've been around the food industry for a while, and this sort of thing tells me a lot about their attitudes. I would never eat at a place that runs out of their signature dish on a weekday afternoon. My question is: has the manager be fired yet?"}
{"text":"Good food and a fun atmosphere... I have been here dozens of times and I can't remember a bad meal ... Great salad."}
{"text":"The blueberry pancakes were surprisingly good for an airport restaurant! And the girls working there were very kind and patient even with some dude ordering 4 double shots in 30 minutes."}
{"text":"We love the place and are regulars. The service is always good and the atmosphere always nice. So I gave it 2 stars because of the new gluten free crust, not so bueno."}
{"text":"Still just as delicious 5 years later! I know places come and go in Vegas all the time, glad Sammie's has stuck around! Every time we come to Vegas we make it a point to get off the strip and stop here. Great staff, great food and nice break from the crowded strip!"}
{"text":"Sammy's never fails to disappoint, especially when my favorite server is working - Jamie aka \"Snoopy\"! From their hummus platter to the freshest of salads to the oh so amazing tomato basil soup - the biggest challenge is \"what to try first!\". It's goes well beyond the food for me, it's the entire experience, which is why the level of service \"Snoopy\" provides just adds icing on the cake. A little taste of home when you can get close to home - love it!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite restaurant. The food is always delish. The pear pizza is my go to. The wait staff is professional and knowledgeable. I haven't had a bad meal here and I am embarassed to say I eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I had Tequila Chicken Pasta. After I ate, I am totally addicted in sammy's tequila pasta!! It is just great!!! The price of this dish was inexpensive and reasonable. I wish I were able to eat everyday!! =]"}
{"text":"If you like a large volume of bland, generic food then this is your place. If you like flavors other than fat, sickly sweet, or creamy, steer clear!  

I had a craving for traditional Italian pizza. Since this place is just down the road, we decided to give it a try. My hubbie and I had the coconut shrimp skewers, which were deep fried beyond recognition and came with a side of citrus-flavored high fructose corn syrup. We then shared a pizza which had a small spoonful of sauce in the center of an oddly sweet flat bread type thing, which in no way resembled pizza base, and it came slathered in oil, ick!  

The service was average, if you consider inattentive to be average. The waiter seemed to be on another planet, and couldn't distinguish lunch from dinner.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"Sammy's is always great! The staff here were really accommodating and worked fast on a busy Saturday night! They have so many healthy options, I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"This was my first time in a Sammy's location.  I informed the guy who sat me and then he went over the menu with me and was very helpful.  I had the New York pizza and iced tea.  The pizza was very good, had more meat on it than I expected!  Great service and food, I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"As you can see from my previous review, I am definitely a fan of Sammy's Wood-fired Pizza. Love the franchise. However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good. 

I went there for lunch a couple of days ago because I was craving their delicious vegan cheese pizza, add pineapples. It was somewhat busy, but not over-crowded. Although our server was very friendly, service in itself left something(s) to the imagination. I ordered their hummus as an appetizer which never made an appearance. The pineapples from my pizza were absent, but the bug in my boyfriend's drink was very present. For some reason, our pizzas just didn't taste as good that day which greatly saddened us. 

Who knows? Maybe it was an off day for them. I think I'll just stick with the Sammy's on Sunsent in Hendes from here on out though."}
{"text":"My bff and I were especially excited to find out that this place offers vegan pizza options. I'm not just talking about some dough with tomato sauce and a few veggies sprinkled on top...they have actual vegan cheese! The tasty kind that melts and all! The kind that you find on a freshly baked Whole Foods vegan pizza. Yes, very exciting indeed.

We went there for happy hour and some pizza a couple of weeks ago. We had the hummus as an appetizer and some red wine to compliment our meal. The hummus was quite delicious and warm pita bread with olive oil and basil atop was served along with it. 

It wasn't very crowded, so the service was terrific and the servers were friendly and attentive. Liz(bff) ordered a margherita pizza and I ordered a pineapple pizza, both vegan stylie. We were on cloud nine. Needless to say, this is one of our favorite happy hour spots."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The duck tacos were fantastic. Also I would highly recommend the messy sundae."}
{"text":"The only reason I joined yelp was to tell everyone how horrible this place was. Honesty the food was ok,  but the service was the worst I've seen in a very long time. We had to ask several times over and over, Just to get our drinks refiled. The waitress had the balls to say to us that she's the worst waitress there. Was that supposed to be some crazy way to apologize? Any way go at your own risk or if you have a long time to waste with nothing to do but wait for terrible service."}
{"text":"Amazing food, tasty and creative pizzas. One of the hidden gems in las Vegas. I think the best meal since I moved here. A must stop and a new fav place!!!"}
{"text":"Very bad service today. I never felt so rushed, but the food was good. The first time I went there it was great, but it was just on of the staff members. Overall it is a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Great gluten-free pizza! Fast service and friendly servers, Greek salad a must!  Lots of seating indoors and out."}
{"text":"I'm on a roll ... The food is DA bomb!!! Pita , hummus and a nice cold blue moon then chowing on a wood fire pizza! I think its going to be a good day!"}
{"text":"It's an airport restaurant bar. Are you going to have a ton of expectations? No, right. This one is above average though. I got some pretty good fish tacos. 

The tacos had flavor and the fries were crunchy. I had a beer to wash it down while I waited for the plane. Give this place a try I think you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"I want to update my last review.  After the terrible experience at the Flamingo/215 location and writing this review, I also sent a complaint to Sammy's corporate.All i wanted from them was  to make sure that the message got to the employees so they wouldn't do that to any future customers. Here's how they got me back as a customer...
I got a quick email reply regarding my complaint (which I took to be just a form email sent to every complainant).  A couple days later I received a phone call from the GM of that location.  I missed his call & forgot to call back and the next week he called again.  For about 5 minutes he apologized and asked if we would give the store a chance to make it up to us.  So, I gave him my address and within about a week I received a gift certificate for $25.  Yesterday my husband and I went in again to the previously dreaded location, not identifying ourselves.  We figured even it was bad again, at least it wouldn't cost much due to the gift certificate.  But EVERYTHING was different!! We were immediately greeted at the door and seated quickly. Our server was very attentive.  The first thing she told us upon seating was that we were in Happy Hour and she explained about the 1/2 price tapas.  And I guess they have a new system where if you want water the server brings you glasses of ice and a carafe of water, which I loved because we were never thirsty.  The food was delicious as before, and the service was flawless.  I felt like they had coached the employees specifically on the issues I mentioned, after receiving my email complaint.  
At the end we asked to speak with the GM and I introduced myself.  He apologized for the previous bad experience AGAIN and explained how he truly appreciated the second chance and that they take feedback to heart and the staff had been coached on the poor service from before (as I had suspected).  
Anyway, long story short, I am now a true fan of Sammy's.  In this day and age it's really hard to find a restaurant that cares THIS much about earning back an unhappy customer, and I think that is almost more of a selling point for this place than the food itself!  If you've never been, please give this location a shot.  They have food for anybody's taste or dietary restrictions. =)"}
{"text":"What happened to the Daiya Cheese?  I didn't see it as a substitution option in the pizza section on the menu so I asked our server.  The menu was redone a few weeks ago so now there are only 3 options for vegans.  Not even the fried tofu with ginger miso is a vegan option - really, vegans are usually the only people that will consider ordering tofu from a non-asian restaurant and Sammy's isn't going to make that an option for us?

Well, one order of hummus for me and a vegetarian pizza for my husband and here's the review.  (BTW, he asked to omit the eggplant from the vegetarian pizza but was told that the toppings were already mixed together.  What?  Are the pizzas  pre-assembled now?  Well, our order was up in less than 5 minutes which solidified my theory - total chain restaurant.  I know there are a lot of Sammy's locations but I honestly thought that freshly prepared food was still the norm.  

The hummus was smeared on the plate with a sloppy dowsing of paprika and served with 8 wedges of flat bread.  I seriously wonder if the flat bread was vegan friendly because it tasted like butter was spread on it rather then olive oil.  I had to generously season the hummus with red pepper flakes for some taste.  

The vegetarian pizza had no flavor.  Husband had to season with both salt & red pepper flakes.  We also deconstructed the pizza looking for any sauce which we could not find.  It did appear that the cherry tomatoes on top were fresh.  

We ordered one glass of wine and one beer and that was all we had.  After consuming all of the red pepper flakes water would have  been welcomed but for some reason we were not offered it.  The other 4 occupied tables in our area all had water, including the other table our server was waiting on.  On the way out the door we made it a point to take water inventory on the rest of the occupied tables and confirmed that we were the only ones without.  

After this experience the all too familiar conversation that we have in the car on the way home is titled:  This is why we never go out to eat."}
{"text":"I loved the old menu but the new menu I really dont care for. I used to go to Sammy at least twice a month and now it's every 6 months."}
{"text":"The servers are so friendly and quick!  The food is always good and fresh. I love the sliders and the chopped chicken salad!  Love this place"}
{"text":"I was invited out to eat lunch with other coworkers because my job celebrates Administrative Professionals day. They took us all to Sammy's Woodfired pizza and Grill up the street. I've heard of this place but have never ate here. It was busy with the normal lunch time crowd when we arrived,  but luckily we had a reservation. 
 We were free to order anything (but alcohol) off the menu,  so I ordered the wagyu cheeseburger with caramelized onions and a side of fries.  Having never tried high quality Japanese beef, I was super excited.
The burger was really good! Cooked well done on a sesame seed toasted bun with lettuce, tomato, and the onions. Fantastic."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas - and they're open 24 hours! You can order takeout any time of day and the quality is always amazing. The duck tacos are to die for, and they do a great job with hummus and salads. We're working our way through the full pizza menu, and I haven't had one pizza that wasn't head & shoulders above all the other pizza places in Vegas. If you're looking for a good, quality meal late (I'm not talking Taco Bell or Jack In The Box) this is the place to be. Late night dine-in specials include 1/2 off appetizers, and the jukebox isn't half bad..."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with some people from work and as always its great.  The service was a little slow, but what isnt in Vegas.  
I had the Grilled Shrimp Salad with a extra shrimp.  It was awesome.  The shrimp if full of flavor, and the salad had just the perfect amount of salad dressing on it.  Would recommend to anyone.."}
{"text":"A couple co-workers and I popped into the separate lounge area of Sammy's on W. Sahara for happy hour.  The bartender was very friendly and the pours of wine were generous.  It is a little dark inside but that is expected for a bar/lounge.  There were just a few people in the bar so the noise level was quiet which was great.  A couple people were gambling but the machine volume was turned way down so that was also pleasant.  Right when we ordered our last drink, a group of people came into the bar and one or more of them was smoking.  Not cool.  The bar didn't smell like smoke when we first got there so I assumed that it was a smoke free establishment."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on their yelp review and that they offered gluten-free option for pizza. It was the worst food I have had in a very long time. 

The waiter was fabulous, very friendly and attentive. But the pizza was inedible. The gluten-free crusts are apparently frozen, but they were not cooked completely through, and had a really off putting taste. The sauce on a pineapple pizza had no flavor, and a margarita pizza was even worse. 

Have had great gluten-free pizzas in other cities, and even much better ones from my own freezer at home. If not for the friendly waiter we probably would have just left the restaurant. We picked off some of the cheese and toppings and ate what we could."}
{"text":"First visit after hearing rave reviews about the place. We went here for dinner on a busy Friday night.  Which is great as this shows how service is when they're jumping.  Husband had a pizza and liked it. Friends had pizza & salad and like them too.  I, on the other hand had the shrimp salad as an entrée. I was told it was large and saw a few being served.  Sadly, there were only 5 (yes, 5) very, very small shrimp in a virtual jungle of greens.  I was hoping as the salad was an entrée size, the protein would be substantial.  Wrong. I asked the server for a glass of ice and waited about 10 minutes when our meals were served to ask the manager serving if I could get a glass of ice.    Our group was thinking of ordering a kind of sundae to share, but it's served in a large wine glass and wouldn't be easy to share, I mentioned that it would be nice if we could get it in a bowl, but the waitress told us that's the way it was served.  period.  just didn't get it and did not offer to serve any other way. Also after using the facilities, I had to go and tell a manager that the ladies room was in need a check. I'm guessing the restrooms aren't checked too often."}
{"text":"Tonite was our first time at sammy's ..Great Pizza and the best shrimp salad! And most of all mojca was the Best waitress!! Most definitely will be back and recommend our friends..Thanks Mojca.."}
{"text":"This place was great. Went here for a lunch meeting and the service was great, the food was delicious and they were able to accommodate a large group at lunch time. I ordered the mahi tacos and they were perfect."}
{"text":"Very happy with this place! I love how professional and clean all staffs are. I love going to a restaurant and not having to hear their personal life and conversation. Very professional. Don't get me wrong, I love a place that is environment friendly and staffs are enjoying themselves but I will say it's always nice to walk into a place and everyone is focuses on the customers. 
-
One thing I definitely liked was how clean the staffs were. There was a gentleman there going around and refilling customers glass of water. He was sweating. He went back to the counter and grabbed a piece of paper and whipped his forehead and threw away the paper. Never did he wipe the sweat off with his hand, back of his hand or even his fingers (very commonly done at other places and it drives me nuts!) way to go guy' lol 
-
Anyway, that sums it all! Thanks Sammy pizza for a great experience and great pizza!"}
{"text":"First time here, but will be back. The waitstaff was friendly, helpful and fast. The food arrived quickly and was well prepared. For two people we shared the Margherita pizza and the Organic Spinach and Tuna salad. The food was good. The pizza crust was really light and easy to chew. I forgot to ask for the vinaigrette on the side. I think they put a bit too much on for my taste."}
{"text":"We had the duck tacos and they were super yummy:)) the crackers that you can ask for were also very good . Just make sure you ask for them : )"}
{"text":"Their Pizza is OK.  Tried it several time but have nothing good or bad to say ... just ok.
I am a fan of their Balsamic grilled chicken salad.  Chicken is marinated and it tastes great, love the cheese and the walnuts as well.  I can taste the basil in the salad and I like the flavor it brings.  I would strongly suggest asking for dressing on the side.   Couple of times I forgot to ask for dressing on the side and my salad was drenched in dressing...
I will be back but just for the salad (with dressing on the side... lol) not the pizza."}
{"text":"I suppose you could ask for better pizza but you will have a hard time finding it, especially in Vegas. Vegas seems o be a place of \" I own a restaurant but no one knows how to cook\". This place knows what they are doing. Can't wait to try the wagyu beef burgers."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I wish the entrance was protected more because the hot or cold air comes slamming in through the front door. The vegi salad is really good. I usually get the onions on the side since it can be too much. I love their iced tea. The patio on the east side of the building is perfect on warmer days. This is a great go to for us when we don't want to think about where to go."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a low key visit to Sammy's tonight. Started with a Ceasar salad for two and then had their pineapple pizza. The salad was ok and the pizza was ok because the crust a bit over baked. Service was fine as always. Over all a decent time. If you go to the Durango location, ask to sit in the dining room to the right as you walk in, it's much quieter there and the ambiance is nicer too. Have fun"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Always friendly, efficient staff & the food is ALWAYS perfect! 
My favs include the Tomato basil soup, tofu, lettuce wraps & chicken skewers for apps. All the pizzas are delish-I've never had one I didn't enjoy! For salad, you can't go wrong either-bring your appetite, the salad is huge! I personally love the chopped chicken, the Greek or the Balsamic chicken! If it's nice out, choose the patio-quaint, quiet & you can get a suntan! 
For servers-we had Karissa this time, who was very friendly & funny! Alan is always excellent & Casey is great too! 
I will be back:)"}

{"text":"I am trying not to be too biased writing this, I do have the reputation of being a pizza snob. I know a few people who rave about this place, I personally just don't understand what the big deal is. This was the second time I have gone to Sammy's and I both times it has been OK. I ordered the New York Style minus mushrooms, I finished my meal so it's not bad food. The place probably has been hyped higher than it should of been. There are better choices in Vegas so I find it hard to recommend."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have loved Sammy's and me in particular since they have great gluten free pizzas but when I decided to throw a surprise party there, they really blew me away with how helpful they were. I had to plan the party from the other side of the world  since I am deployed and their GM Julie was so incredibly helpful. They allowed me to pre order the food and pay for it as well as write a special message on a pizza for me! The let my friend drop off a cake a couple hours before the dinner and stored it for us. Everyone who came to the party said it was a wonderful experience and I know that is because of the great staff that works here!!  I cannot wait to get home and  have some Sammy's pizza!! (And the amazing quinoa salad)"}
{"text":"I've recently started getting take out from Sammy's as I'm 7 1/2 months pregnant and need good food on the go. Recently I ordered the corn chowder soup for the first time and noticed it was a little bleak with literally just a few kernels floating around. I called them back to double check if that's the way it usually came (since I had never had it) and the manager informed me that it isn't and asked me to come back so he may replace it. He kindly showed me the new soup cup and asked if he could have mine back so that he could show the chef and prevent that from happening again. I'm very pleased at how the manager, Richard, handled the situation and because of that I will be returning to that location often."}
{"text":"Delicious food, but very expensive.  I ordered a Caesar salad with the whole breast of chicken and a beer that totaled out to 24.82 before tip.  I am guessing that the half of breast of chicken would be $3 instead of the $6 for the whole, but still $20... that place should be rated with $$$ not $$."}

{"text":"I cannot begin to express my utter annoyance and frustration of waiting for a table, FINALLY getting seated and then being COMPLETELY ignored by the waitstaff. That is the situation that just occurred at Sammy's. Two servers in our area and neither one even acknowledged our presence after 15 minutes. We were walked right by and it wasn't busy (about 3 tables for each server). I asked the hostess for the manager and advised her of the issue. She, to her credit, was very attentive and offered to comp our meal if we stayed but it was far too late and I simply wanted her to be aware of the severe lack of service her staff was providing. I will never be back."}
{"text":"Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill has the healthiest food this side of Las Vegas! I highly recommend it for people on a Gluten Free diet. They offer very tasty dishes."}
{"text":"A quaint little spot, with both tables and booths surrounding the outer edges of the dining area. We ordered the Lebni, Thai Chicken Satays & the Garlic Cheese Bread for starters. All were very good, the only minor complaint was the satays were a little bland. We also ordered a pepperoni pizza & a Greek salad with chicken breast. Both were excellent. I also paired a glass of wine with my meal. We went during Happy Hour, so tapas were 50% off & wine was $2 off per glass. For the price, you can't beat it. Definitely going again soon!"}
{"text":"Sammy's is our go-to, close to home, I don't feel like cooking kind of place. Portions are good, food is quality and fresh and the service is great. The restaurant is pretty small, but satisfactory for parties of 2-6. I wouldn't recommend this if you had a large group. Bar area is just \"meh\" so I wouldn't recommend Sammys if you want to watch sports and hang out at a bar. This is perfect for a lunch with coworkers, dinner with the kids or a causal couples dinner (not a date).

Some of our favorites are:

Hummus Appetizer
Thai Chicken Satay
Chinese Chicken Salad
Pear & Arugula Pizza
Sicilian Rustic Pizza
Mahi Tacos
Thai Chicken Salad

PS: for salads ALWAYS order a half order. They are huge."}
{"text":"I was really hoping to order one of my favorite salads but since we were at a different location, different menu items. Not everything was different, but it forced me to try something new, which wasn't bad. 

I ordered a Thai Chicken Salad (I think) which was really good and my boyfriend order a hawaiian pizza with sausage and jalapeños. We both enjoyed our food very much.

The strange thing was the service. It was kind of on the bad side. There were probably 4 groups outside (including us) and 2 inside, so it wasn't very busy. And we waited a long time to get our waters, get our food, refills, and our bill at the end, we became impatient and got up and handed our waiter the bill as we were leaving. Eh. They were nice, but slow.

Luckily the food tasted good."}
{"text":"Me and my daughters were the only ones in the place. Our pizzas took over 20 minutes. I ordered the 5 cheese pizza. It was so salty I could barely eat it.  As if someone poured salt on it. My waiter was very pleasant and interacted with my girls as if they are young ladies.... which I really liked.  Had I not been so hungry I would have sent the pizza back and left. It was that bad."}
{"text":"interesting.  after my post, i got a message from jay, the mgr at the sammys location i described.  it was a lengthy message, asking to make things right etc etc etc.  what i find very interesting is that i have talked to jay before, when the bad instances happened!  so clearly his memory is not so hot.  we got takeout, half the order was wrong, we called in and were told they couldnt refund or give us a replacement on the house the next time we came in.  a few weeks later we called the sahara location and placed an order and when we picked up, happened to tell the mgr about what had happened.  SHE heaped the apologies and freebies on us and was extraordinarily nice.  so then i called corporate and told them the whole story.  after that, jay had called back and basically said well we dont really know who did what (not taking any blame), but we will send a gift certificate to you for your troubles.  i am not exaggerating when i say we have probably spent several thousand at this place in the last year, and we had told corporate that.  and the order that was wrong was about a $100 order.  a few weeks later i get a $20 gift certificate in the mail.  we havent been back to that location since.  and now he cant even remember (this was only a few months ago) and wants to make things right??  i guess if i'd have replied to his message, maybe i'd have gotten another $20 off.  no thanks, i'll drive to sahara.  his reply just makes me irritated all over again.  if you go there, dont ask for jay...he has memory issues."}
{"text":"We were frequent Sammys customers when they were in Centennial hills and loved it.  We went to Sammys on Flamingo we ordered the Humus w/flat bread, coconut shrimp and the chopped chicken salad.  It took forever to get our small salad we kept asking where is the salad coming from the waiter kept telling us it coming.  Well  it's coming took almost 20 minutes to 1/2 hr,  in the mean time we had our shrimp and humus.  We wanted everything together but it never happened.  Don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this Sammy's location a few times now, and every time it's the same mediocre experience.  It takes 10 minutes just to choose something from the monstrous menu, and by the end of the experience, only my hunger is satisfied. I don't know about you, but I usually go to a restaurant for more than just filling my gut.  Let me explain.

The Sammy's menu doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.  Yes, their main draw is pizza, and they dedicate an entire page to this noble cause.  But then you flip the page, and they have a bunch of tapas dishes.  Okay... I don't get it, but I'll go along.  Then you flip the next page, and there's full-on entree dishes with no clear theme.  I know that variety is good, but I also expect some cohesion among your menu items.  For me, it just makes the decision process difficult.  Nothing stands out among the random dishes.

As for the execution of the food, I've never had a memorable experience here.  I was hungry when I came in, and now I'm not.  Hunger has been quelled, and that's about it.  I've tried the flatbread pizza (bbq chicken, maybe?) and oak roasted chicken with asparagus.  I've tried something else, but I don't remember (and I usually remember what I eat). 

It's a decent atmosphere for business luncheons, but I wouldn't choose it on my own dime."}
{"text":"I have to admit to being a regular at this Sammy's.  All of the restaurants have the same menu, but over the past three years of eating at four Sammy's in Vegas, this one has become my favorite for lunch, while the Rainbow location remains my happy hour spot.  Why the difference?  It all comes down to the staff.  The lunch crew at Sahara is dialed in to their customers and handles the rush in stride.  Mojca, Albert, Sam, and Tia all do a  terrific job, even at the busiest times.  The guys in the kitchen turn out consistently fresh and impressive entrees; particularly the salads.  Christina runs a tight shop and it shows up in the great food and service.

Happy hour let's you graze through  a wide variety of half- price tapas that reinforce Sammy's Lebanese heritage.  I've had many a dinner of just these tasty items at Aaron's Rainbow location and if there's a \"Cheers\" equivalent in my world, this is it.

Excellent food, a wide variety and friendly, caring employees.  Hard to hit this trifecta in Vegas."}
{"text":"We were in LV for a few days. After several disappointments on the strip, we saw Sammy's while driving by. They closed the location in Tempe and were happy to find one here.
We just had 2 pizzas and ice cream. Both were good as expected. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to eat at this place twice. It was some of the best wood fired pizza we've eaten since our trip to Fort Lauderdale. EVERYTHING was fresh! The service was great, so great they gave us a free dessert for our first time visiting. We will definitely be coming back to this place again when we come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"The duck tacos are to die for.  They are absolutely amazing.  Pretty much the whole reason I go there.  Be careful w/ their beverages, you pay $10+ for a cocktail with tons of lime/lemon or sour mix in it and no booze.  I paid $10 for a grey goose pear drink and it was all lime juice.  My husband got a rye drink that was all whiskey and nothing else, which is better than just getting juice.  The pizza was sub par.  We got the Sicilian.  I thought Sicilian was thick pizza, this was not.  And all of the ingredients were shoved into the middle b/c they were closing in 30 min and just tried to hurry it up apparently.  We ordered our drinks w/ our meal and they came out when we were over halfway done w/ our meal.  They have a nice patio with a good view which we enjoyed.  Server was super friendly but seemed really busy, but we saw it wasn't really busy when we were there, maybe they needed an extra hand.  Seemed like it.  But going just for those duck tacos, that's all you need."}
{"text":"Sammy's is usually a reliable standby, but AVOID THIS LOCATION! The service started out fine, but then fell off a steep cliff. The food orders were wrong for our entire table, so there was big disconnect with the kitchen. They were terribly under-staffed which contributed to the chaos."}
{"text":"I'm so sad! I wish I could give a better review but today's experience was so disappointing.

I love Sammy's! The food today was perfect and exactly as expected. This review is aimed to the poor service we received.

I am in town to visit with my mother whom I rarely get a chance to see. We came here to relax and have a nice late lunch and chat. We came in around 2 and the floor was empty. It was a perfect setting to visit and chat. 

My issue is with the pressure we received from the waitress. Her name is Alexandra. She was in such a rush to push us in and out. She was very rude. As soon as we got food she seemed to be rushing to clear our table. As soon as she could she was offering us to go boxes and trying to take our empty plates. She was in such a rush for us to hand her plates that a water glass got knocked over. I asked for some more tea with an agenda to finish our visit and she pushed us to take it in plastic to go cups. After she brought us tea in plastic cups she ignored us completely. I had to yell out to her for attention to get a little more tea. 

In total we were only sitting in the restaurant for under an hour of time. Our bill was nearly $100 and we were treated like we had no value. I see no reason to feel so pressured and rushed to leave. This really spoiled my visit with my mother and I can't believe the disrespect during such a slow time on the restaurant floor. This was really inappropriate and I hope that no one has to endure this experience."}
{"text":"Pizzas are tiny. I can get one twice as big for the same price with better quality at Grimaldis down to road"}
{"text":"Very good experience! The service was great.The server made suggestions! We ended up ordering the Greek salad and the sun dried tomato artisan pizza. The pizza was awesome! Loved the pine nuts ,and my boyfriend loves thin crust pizza and it was super thin! The one thing I didn't like was the tables were too close together!  And the beer selection was seriously lacking! Other than that it was perfect!"}
{"text":"The food at Sammy's is terrific. The woodfired pizzas are excellent, the pasta dishes are delicious, and even the more traditional items like hummus and kobe beef burgers are great.  They truly have something here for everyone. The service is always good even when they are busy."}
{"text":"This place surprised my husband and I. We went one night wanting to try something new and had little to no expectations for this place. We ordered the chicken peanut sauce satay and a BBQ pizza with some appetizer fries. Everything was awesome. The staff was super attentive. They have a range of dishes that will fit in to whatever type of food/price you are aiming for. An odd mix of Thai and American that somehow works perfectly for them. I highly recommend giving them a shot, you shouldn't leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"Something for everyone and a Vegan delight! We had the Veggie Pizza with Wheat Crust and Vegan Cheese and the Red Quinoa Salad..... Both were delicious! Left feeling full but not heavy. The kids tried the lobster bisque and kids pizza all were hits! Great service! Definitely a FAVORITE!!!"}
{"text":"Sammy's is always consistently good... Great healthy vegetarian & vegan options... Amazing staff and such delicious food... So happy we got takeout & I didn't have to cook!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today. The manager felt I waited too long for my meal to be made and served so she comped my entire meal. That shocked and surprised me, I did not feel I waited long. Thank you, the food and the service was great. I'm totally coming back, there are so many other item on the menu I want to eat."}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite local restaurants! we visit this location at least twice a month and every time the staff is so friendly and the food is always great! they have a great variety of appetizers but we still have not tried them all. the woodfire pizzas are a great alternative to mainstream pizza places. the new york style pizza is great every time. even when they are busy it doesnt seem like its too crowded. they are also military friendly which is a plus! :)  i would definitely recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"The best place to get duck taco, and hummus. And the customer service is great. I would definitely come back to this place"}
{"text":"Had a vegetarian pizza and watermelon mint drink. Both were delicious. Service was also excellent. It was a very clean place. I will absolutely go back to eat."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Sammy's for many years but after last night's experience I won't be going back. I had a 20% coupon that I received by email but when I mentioned it to my waitress she went to the manager who said I needed a printout. I then spoke with the manager who blamed the error on a miscommunication with the waitress and accepted the online coupon.
I ordered a salad with dressing on the side only to receive a salad sopping with dressing with additional dressing on the side. By this point I was extremely frustrated and decided just to eat the salad and not make an additional fuss. I didn't realize I had to be painstakingly specific in ordering and that this would be so difficult. 
Our overall service was mediocre. I did not have to leave my house, drive miles to this restaurant only to be aggravated by this establishment. There are plenty of better choices next time..... 
BTW....one star is being generous....."}
{"text":"Considering it's located at the airport and there's only few places to eat - my friend and I decided to select this place as it is near our terminal.

I'm not happy with the food as well as the service. I ordered the Mini Kobe Beef Hamburgers. and it came out overcooked. It took 40 minutes to get our food! I mean how long does it take to cook 3 small burgers which were overcooked and burnt to a crisp.. There was no flavor as it was very dry.  Please save your money and eat at Wendys at the LAS airport. You will have a better experience."}
{"text":"We went to this location to celebrate my daughter's birthday. The staff made our experience very special and the service was exceptional! I've never tried anything on the menu that I didn't enjoy, but their Messy Sundae was perfect. The server even put a candle on it for my daughter. Hands down, our favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"Sammy's Woodfired Pizza is a good place to go for pizza (duh) and tapas.  It is located in a very safe neighborhood.  Parking is easy.  Service is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"We got Pork pot stickers which are fantastic here. We shared a greek salad...Was fair.....then a thai pizza ...Gross I do not recomend this one...."}
{"text":"Sammy's pizza is harmonious. What I mean, is that the prices are reasonably balanced with the flavors and quality of the food. For about $12 you can order a pizza that serves two people, with many fresh ingredients. I've also had the salads and appetizers here. 

The coconut shrimp skewers are a little too sweet for me. Since coconut has a lot of natural sugar, it is overkill to serve something coated in it with an even sweeter sauce. I think offering something spicy, maybe with Sriraucha in it would help. 

We usually vary our order, so I've tried just about everything on the menu. I prefer the plain Jane cheese pizza over all the others. This is concerning, since clearly Sammy's isn't specializing in just cheese pizza. 

If I'm feeling too lazy to cook I'll\"ll carry out from Sammy's since its close, affordable, and not too greasy. 

The BBQ Chicken pizza is quite good, but you can't go wrong with a classic."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Their ambiance is on the louder side. Not the best place to take a client for business conversations, but at the same time its a nice casual atmosphere. The food is great. Their salads are huge. Their appetizers are unique and tasty and the pizzas are really good. All fresh. Mostly organic ingredients. I really want to try their cotton candy. Overall, great place for dinner or lunch for casual american food."}
{"text":"Good airport food. Chicken wraps are good a little to much onion. Kobe sliders very good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place  , the dough , the cheese and the flavors are so good !!!!! We always order the NY style pizza , along with a Greek salad . I remember in Hawaii I had the best pizza ever and this place reminds me of it so much   everything is so good , I love the fireplace outside , it's so cozy !!! You must try this place 

Try the empanadas  and the donuts"}
{"text":"Horrible service. The guy just walked up to me and stared until I said \"I'll take a water.\" If was odd. In their defense, it's a pizza place, and I didn't get pizza. Otherwise this would be one star. It's probably fine for just drinks, too. It is airport food, but service shouldn't be this bad.

Got the fries. They seem freeze dried or something and not actually fried. Pretty disgusting. Greek salad would be ok if the peppers weren't really hard for some reason. I just kept having to spit them back out (gross I know) since they just weren't edible."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, beautiful restaurant.  Not your average pizza joint! They also have tapas on the menu. I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great time. Great sevice. Had the lamb and it was fantastic!!! We also got cotton candy for our daughter WOW. We will be going back a lot."}
{"text":"Heavenly good, 5 star customer service. Highly recommended for anyone going out to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"I forget what a great place this is and it has one of the best happy hours - half off apps and wine. I was pleasantly surprised about the gluten free options - especially a place know for their pizza and pasta.  The food was delicious and excellent service."}
{"text":"Sammy's is about the worst pizza I've had in a very long time.  Being from Texas, we put sauce on our pizza (tomato sauce, pizza sauce) Sammy's evidently doesn't use sauce. First, I ordered a margarita pizza and asked the waiter if it came with a red sauce or something else. He didn't know and said that he didn't think it came with sauce so I ordered a basic cheese pizza. Common sense tells me cheese pizza comes with pizza sauce. Obviously not at Sammy's. What I got was Little Ceasar's cheesy bread. 

According to the menu there are multiple locations and I can't image why. DiGornio frozen pizza is better than Sammy's. Besides the taste of the pizza, the waiter wasn't knowledgeable and seemed overwhelmed.  Which means the location at the Vegas airport is under-staffed.  They must do a good bar business.  Anyway, if you're stuck in the Vegas airport, by all means try it but lower your expectations because it's not very good."}
{"text":"I called in an order for pick up and the girl on the phone (I wish I would have gotten her name) was awesome. Normally, I dislike placing to go orders - there always seems to be some kind of miscommunication and usually when I pick up my food its wrong. But not her! She spoke clearly with me on the phone. She was so kind and efficient! When we went to get our food, they had us wait at the bar. The food took a few more minutes the expected, no big deal. We didn't complain or comment on it. But the girl (I believe the same one who helped me on the phone) gave us a free dessert :) our food was awesome! And the customer service awesome! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had to send my food back, pasta was tough and sauce tasted like a can of chef bouyardee..."}
{"text":"When I'm in Vegas, I always make a point of stopping at Sammy's. the balasamic grilled chicken salad is out-of-this-world. And don't forget the big messy sundae to top off all those greens at the end of your meal. 

Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Not stoked at all especially after the build up. Didn't get pizza. Actually turned my bolognese dish back. Overall, not happy with the entire experience."}
{"text":"They have a dine in place but you cannot sit there and eat because there are no servers (at 7 pm), how dumb is that?!"}
{"text":"The place was more than half empty when we walked in and we still had to seat ourselves because no came to greet us. It was very dark inside so I couldnt see the menu well enough to decide what to order so i just orded a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was good but not worth 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love the food the Chicken Ceaser Salad was delicious, pizza real good.will come again. Service was great as well.Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Well this was a nice surprise. Cute little eatery hiding in Smith's plaza. I got the Flat Iron Steak. Hon got the Oak Roasted Chicken. Daughter got the Kobe Beef Sliders. 

I was good, daughter was good. Hon broke out the salt and pepper. Not bad just not what she was expecting. Clean plates though. Def going to be back. There's a whole pizza menu waiting!!! Can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"One of the best value eateries in Las Vegas and possibly the best pizza. We eat here once a week. Fresh ingredients, enormous portions."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal at any location...  The ground beef hummus is the best hummus I've had in my life!  Tonight I tried the coconut shrimp for the first time and I ate the whole thing!   It was outstanding!

The only reason they are losing a star is because we got there around 8:30, they closed at 9:30 and we could feel them trying to get out soon.  At about 9:00 the entire staff of 3 sat down to eat a meal in the restaurant in front of customers.  Our waitress was still very nice and attentive so I don't want to complain about service, but it was a little off-setting.  Could they not have waited another 30 minutes until the restaurant was closed or go in the back and take a few bites?  Not very professional at all and made it feel like we were a burden.

I definitely want to reiterate that despite the hiccup, our service was good and the food was still excellent... Would not keep me from returning by any means or recommending it to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Oh man, our house loves Sammy's. We used to go every Thursday but we've been really busy and haven't been able to make it over- so now we get takeout. ha
Food:
Our favorites are their salads and the pizzas.- Notably the chinese chicken salad, bbq chicken pizza and the vegetarian pizza. Ask for the balsamic dressing to dip the vegetarian pizza in. mmmm
The steak sandwich is also pretty stellar. 
We've had most of the menu at some point and have never been disappointed. 

Service: 
Service is always great. Everyone who works there is nice and friendly. We do request Janae (Junae?) though. She knows our order and is AWESOME. 

Also, the ambiance of the Sammy's is nice. Spring/Beginning of summer it's really nice to sit out on the patio around dusk and hang out with friends.

Overall, we love this place, and can't say enough good about it!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my latest trip to Sammy's.  I've eaten there at least 6 times before, but this time everything seems to have gone downhill.  To start, there was no host or hostess around, for a while.  It took forever to even get water, and we were seated outside when it was warm out, so the wait seemed even worse.  It wasn't busy inside, so I'm not quite sure what the hold up was.  Our waiter was friendly, but he seemed to disappear for long stretches, and when our food finally came and we had problems with our orders, he was no where to be found, so another server handled the problems.
As far as the food, the lebni was great as always.  We tried the new White Tuna and Spinach salad, it was very good.  I wanted to try something other than my usual entree, but I couldn't decide what to order.  The waiter recommended the Organic Arugala and Pear Pizza.  I instead ordered the new Diavola Pizza, wanting to try something different.  What a mistake.  It was horrible.  Slabs of hard salami on spinach, with gouda and peppers.  Just too much of a mish mash of tastes for me.  My boyfriend tried the new Sicilian Pizza, and hated it almost just as much.  They replaced our pizza's with a 5 Cheese and a Mozzerella Pizza at no charge, but at that point both of us had lost our appetite.  Next time I'll stick with something tried and true like the LaDou's BBQ Chicken Pizza or try the waiters recommendation for the Arugala & Pear."}
{"text":"During a quick lunch break with my coworker we decided to try this place based on a recomendation from another coworker.  The service we had was great!  I felt that we had more than one waiter when all the staff was refilling our drinks and delivering the food.  

We ordered a chopped salad to split (Which they did for us!!) and a chesse pizza.  The salad was delicious and the pizza was good.  I would definitely return to this place."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places. I'm a bit bitter because they removed numerous menu items several months ago. One of my favorites was a shrimp, crab, & artichoke dip served w/ warm pita bread. Another was the steak tip sandwich. I ventured into this location a month ago to find out that alot more items than just these ones were removed.

I gave it a chance since it's Sammy's! I tried the Oak roasted chicken. It was tender, juicy, & delicious! Outside of that item, nothing popped out at me since I was not in the mood for pizza. Which btw the way they have GREAT pizza & you can see it being made.

Staff is always friendly & knowledgeable of the menu. Never a wait even at lunch time! Don't forget about their happy hour which is 4-6pm!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at various Sammy's in the past, however this was my first time eating here. We tried to order from here a few weeks prior to no luck as they didn't have some of the menu items I typically order.
We did however order some salads & decided to pass on the happy hour, which is pretty awesome! It's half off tapas & $2 off beers & wines from 3-6pm.
The request was for no cheese on one of the 2 salads. The salad came up for it to be delivered. Either the server didn't put in the special order originally or the chef didn't read the ticket entirely. I overheard the server Steve S. state 'this was ordered w/ no cheese' so the crisis was avoided. The person is allergic to dairy. It was good that we were sitting by the kitchen to over here the avoidance.
Another great experience at Sammys!"}
{"text":"Back to Sammy's for our favorite salad. As always our favorite waitress was as efficient and friendly as usual. Marnie D makes sure everything is on time and excellent, she introduced her General Manager Gwen to us, (we remembered Gwen from a prior visit and she remembered us how neat) she is as friendly and outgoing as Marnie. Looking forward to our next visit, hopefully Marnie D will be there to brighten our day.

{"text":"I had lots of extra time to scope out Yelp reviews before dining and decided to give this place my business.  The pizza was great.  Nicely flavored evenly cooked crust, seasoned sauce and an even distribution of toppings.  Instead of just throwing tiny chunks of ham and pineapple on the pizza as a traditional Hawaiian, this had thinly sliced toppings ensuring my favorite combination in every bite.  I would absolutely return.  Waiter was friendly as well."}
{"text":"We were asked if we were 21 before we were sat. How bizarre, I can order pizza without being 21. The waitress also would only split the check 2 ways. We needed a three-way split for business expense purposes. That \"rule\" isn't very customer friendly.
Editing my review to reflect that the manager reached out to explain that the waitress lied about the ability to split the check for us. She was bad at her job but at least the restaurant manager cares enough to want to make it right."}
{"text":"This place is for women. Nothing on the menu a MAN would want. It's all organicy, low fat tasteless woosie food with no flavor. Their pizza tastes like freakin cardboard.  Yuck.

I ordered the Mahi Mahi fish tacos which were surprisingly delicious considering this is a pizza place. Definitely recommend eating at this restaurant."}

I ordered a grilled shrimp salad and I was enjoying it until I saw a cricket all covered in my dressing without legs, so I supposed or either those legs where somewhere else in my salad or I already ate them. I went to the bathroom and puked it up. They just said: Sorry!, and paid for it. People!, check the food before it gets out from the kitchen or at least, cover it so nothing lands on it. Disgusting!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places awesome appetizers. Killer pizzas and huge salads  Have always received great service !! Top notch waiters and management. Parmesan Crusted Artichokes are out of this world !!  and great Kobe sliders ask for both cheeses on it.."}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying I've eaten at Sammy's for over 20 years, to make sure there's no confusion this is the Sahara location. this started off with poor service, ask for table for 3 only two place settings were there  had to ask for a third, right at the beginning when I sat down I asked to sample their wine that is advertised on the table a good 10 minutes went by and a full class was sitting on the counter which I told the waitress that I'd only asked for a sample. Margarita Pizza it was okay. Ordered the braised lamb tacos what came was stewed lamb that reminded you of the texture of cat food. Nothing remotely like it was described apparently Sammys isn't cooking their little Kobe Burgers to temperature anymore but didn't tell me until I got my extra well-done burgers. I know for a fact that the corporate chefs and trainers would have been very disappointed with tonight's performance on all fronts the only saving grace was very nice front house manager that tried to make things better."}
{"text":"This is our first time at this location. And i must say the restaurant is nice, its clean and pleasant.
It was not that busy, 3 tables with a total of 10 people, yet it took sometime to be greeted by a member of staff, well i say greeted, i honestly thought that she was a mute, until she was chatting away to another member of staff later. She didn't make us feel welcome at all.  But our main waitress was great, she was friendly and helpful. The food was great, no complaints there. Unfortunately we made the mistake of asking the first girl for more fries, she even couldn't' be bothered or forgot, either way we didn't get them.

Its sad to see nice places like this that serve good food and employ staff that just don't want to be there."}
{"text":"Soup was good...shrimp salad was good.
Price is always more than nearby competitors, but it's a little better suited for business luncheons.

I think they're cutting back on the shrimp count in those salads....maybe trying to increase profit margin a little?

Always good service and a clean, quality atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome service and food! Gotta get the messy sundae!!!"}
{"text":"Sammy's has a good reputation as the familiar place you go to with friends or family, but this location is all wrong. 
The food tastes like it's slapped together. No care whatsoever. 
The presentation is deceiving because it does look nice. 
I've tried the place twice and each time ordered salad and pizza. 
The salad is fine. You can't go wrong here just have to buy and stock fresh ingredients. But the pizza is just horrible. The crust is tasteless, the toppings are deflated and molded into the crust, overall I would say it tastes like frozen pizza."}
{"text":"We came to this location for the first time last night.  We usually go to the one on Sahara since it's open late.

Great food and great service from our server Derek.  My friend and I ordered a glass of wine each.  Our server made some good recommendations.  The only thing we wish we would have known beforehand is that on Wednesdays wine bottles are half off.  There was a little flyer on our table, but it would have been nice if it were also mentioned.  

My boyfriend and I ordered duck tacos (amazing!!), a mozzarella & sundried tomato pizza, and the kobe beef sliders. All delicious!

My friend and her boyfriend ordered a caesar salad, garlic cheese bread, and a pepperoni pizza.  Again all good.  I liked the salad but everyone else thought that it was a bit strange.  Maybe it was the dressing.

We had a good time and it's always nice to have a personable server.

2 glasses of wine, 3 sangrias, 3 beers, 2 appetizers, 1 salad, 2 pizzas, and 1 order of sliders came out to $130.  It adds up quick but it was worth it.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I get off work late so I end up coming to the bar for late night dinner about once a week. After 2AM is their happy hour, all appetizers are half off! (As well as beer specials). The duck tacos, chicken satays, and steak skewers are a must try. So bomb! 

I've had two different bartenders/servers. One is alright, the other is great! Super friendly and cheerful. One person in our group was trying to pick a song with their jukebox which wasn't working at the time, so our server gave us a list of stations we could choose from. Although we didn't change it, it was very thoughtful of him. Wish I could remember his name.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I have ate here twice. The first time my friend and I dined in, and the second time I called in for a take out meal.  When I dined in the food was great, I had the hummus app and a steak for my main dish.  The food was awesome but the service was lacking a little, the waitress wasn't very attentive.  Both times the staff has been friendly though, and I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Good food,  reasonable price. 

Airport food is usally a grab and run affair for me but we decided to stop in Sammy's because it was the only place we could find with vegetarian type food in our corner of the airport. 

The Greek salad is huge. I think it was 8.99. Very good.  I cook and I shop. There was at least 8.00 worth of home shopped ingredients. It was very fresh and easily enough for two people. 

The pizza was surprisingly good and was made very quickly. Getting one special made--without cheese and with ingredients that were not in the menu--was no problem. We just basically said we want a pizza with this and that on it. The pizza magically appeared just as ordered. The silverware was metal and the plates were real. The crust was crispy and good. The pizza was hoping to. It arrived at the same time as our huge salad. 

A couple of other things caught my attention. If you eat in a real restaurant at an airport like Chili's or maybe TGI Fridays the seating is cramped,  there is always a rush,  the menu is small,  and there is no chance to see the food prep area and who might actually be cooking the food. Earing for alot of other places in sitting in a center area like a mall food court. Sammy's has everything in plain sight and the tables are normal sized. The waitstaff and cookstaff were all mature and professional. The restaurant was clean and well laid out. We were not rushed to order or to leave after we ate. It was a peaceful respite from the sterile hustle of the airport,  just a few feet away. They didn't even charge us for our iced teas,  and drinks at the airport are generally ridiculously priced. 

Good restaurant.  Sammy's opened my eyes to the possibility that an airport dining experience for a non drinker vegetarian--beyond a cup of yogurt or fruit--can be a worthwhile experience. Compared to the tiny,  expensive,  offerings of the Starbucks a few feet away,  well,  there was no comparison. Sammy's is also located adjacent to the A Terminal.  So close,  in fact,  that you can see and hear when it is time to go. This is a great place to eat and unwind before being jammed into an American Airlines plane."}
{"text":"I went to place off a recommendation. Was not disappointed. The place looks and smells great. I got my food to go as the wife ordered online ahead of time. The lady that gave me the food explain how to properly dressed a the Gorgonzola pizza we ordered. We also got the steak burger. Both were good and next time we will go and dine in."}
{"text":"Sammys is excellent!! Pizza is only one facet of their menu. Love the garlic chicken with added sundried tomatoes and also just a simple Margheritta pizza. The chili is also excellent. Salads are good. Still exploring things at this restaurant but great for a local to grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I went to Sammy's for a birthday dinner on 6/25/16 and I must say the service and food was excellent. Our server Jess was outstanding. She catered to all of our needs with a sense of urgency and made our experience unforgettable. My family ordered the chopped chicken salads, tomato basil angel-hair pasta, and margarita pizza which were all excellent. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is searching for a great meal with great service for an affordable price. Make sure you ask for Jess."}
{"text":"Received a gift card for here a looooong time ago and figured it was about time that I tried the place. Along with the gift card, I signed up for their E-Club where I immediately received a coupon for a Bogo pizza. A fantastic deal, in my opinion. 

We ended up getting two pizzas and an appetizer. 

The app was a Mediterranean Dip Trio. It included Hummus, baba ghanoush, and Lebni cheese. My favourite out of the three was the baba ghanoush. The hummus was also good, but the Lebni cheese just tasted like a really lemony sour cream. Of course, this was my first time having Lebni cheese, so I can't compare it to others elsewhere. I'm not saying it was bad, just not as good as the others on the trio platter. 

The two pizzas we got were the Goat cheese pizza and the Burrata and Pesto pizza. Both were good. My boyfriend preferred the Burrat and Pesto, but I preferred the Goat cheese. 

The pizzas aren't large. They are about the size of a large dinner plate. We ended up taking leftovers home. Not a whole lot, but a few slices of pizza. 

Overall, our experience was a good one. The food is decent and the menu has a LOT of variety.  Our waitstaff was also very pleasant and constantly smiling. Will we come back? Not sure. It was good but not anything special. Perhaps during happy hour?"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Everyone at the table loved their food, plus the staff is amazing!!!! Arnold and Jaime were the best.  Wish I lived here to visit more!"}
{"text":"I just love Happy Hour at Sammy's, half price appetizers,  $2 off wine.
We order 6 appetizers 1 glass of wine and 2 beers the bill was only $47!!
Service is always great at this location. Love Love Love Sammy's!"}
{"text":"Although the food is good the wait time is horrendous. Do not go here if your flight leaves within 2 hours our you'll be running to the gate with a to-go bag and an empty stomach. 
Also, unless you're feeling rich, don't order beer. It's seriously overpriced. Save your money and go to the little Belgian beer kiosk that's right down the way instead. 
Overpriced and slow are the words that best describe it."}
{"text":"Ok hate to give bad review but I feel travelers need to know.
I didn't eat here because already eaten, I'm anout to board in a red eye flight.
I ask for a glass of Pinot Noir, you can chose between 6oz, 9oz or the bottle.
Since I'll have a long flight I asked for a 9oz, listed for $ 19.50, not cheap and a small bottle of sparkling water.
When the glass arrived I noticed immediately that it was not 9oz, I sell fragrances and 9pz is more than 250ml, more than a quarter of a liter.
I thought they made a mistake but after tasting the wine I was happy they did because I've rarely tasted such cheap, acid, disgusting wine. That type of wine that takes 30 min to finish a glass because you can barely swallow it.
Well the check arrived for over $ 26.00, ONE glass of wine and a small bottle of water .
I left $ 4.00 tip because I always feel bad for waiters so I ended up to pay $ 30.52 for a glass of cheap/disgusting wine and a small bottle of water.
Is there anything else that I can say?
Yes there is: there was also a light that was keeping getting on and off, perfect to enhance the robery armosphere...
I mean, does it take so much to make a Customer happy? A glass of wine and a bottle of water and still you can't make it??
TERRIBLE"}
{"text":"I ordered for pick up. I ordered the arugula quinoa salad. I get this salad all the time, and it's always consistently soooo yummy!! The ladies at the register are super nice! It's usually pretty busy and orders take about 20 min before it's ready. The kitchen is always open because it's connected to a 24 hr bar, so that's cool too! They have plenty of vegan options including vegan cheese, but no vegan desserts!"}
{"text":"Not sure where my review went...but when we lived Rain/Robin we used to come here alllll the time!

That quinoa salad (vegan). If you order that be prepared to share or be really hungry, it's huge!

We love the hummus app (vegan) and I always ask for lettuce cups because I don't like bread/pita. Hubby eats the pita I dip with lettuce.

They do a gluten free pizza with cheeze (vegan) but be aware that their regular dough has dairy/egg in it.
It's ok but nothing to blow your socks off. I really think they probably use an Udi's pre made frozen crust for that gluten free base.

The service is always spot on at this location. They don't bug you (ugh I hate it when servers rush or want to \"chat\") and they keep water and iced tea filled!

Sammy's all over town I have found to be very consistent. So you should have the same experience too :)"}
{"text":"We have been here a million times and a million times it was a great experience.

The menu is clearly marked vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free.

Great HH! Plenty of options on drink choices and tapas type apps. 

The food is always fresh and the service is always fast and friendly. 

Our favs are the hummus it comes with pita but the gluten free option is lettuce wraps (butter lettuce pieces). When we order this we ask for both and they are always nice to do so. I like the lettuce and husband likes the pita.

Small pizzas you can do gluten free or regular. For the true vegan option I believe you have to select the gf option and of course the Daiya. I'm not a fan of gf or Daiya but husband has order that with mushrooms and kala olives and it was ok.

My personal fav fav fav.....is the quinoa and beet salad. Not only is it yummy it's freaking huge!!!!!!!! It's big enough for three people but I like to eat it until my jaw feels likes it's going to fall off :D it's yummy.

Lots of choices here. Good for groups or small groups of picky eaters because they have something for everyone. 

Want to eat cotton candy for dinner??? You can also do that here...wow."}
{"text":"This isn't your $2 a slice kinda place, this is a real restaurant, although nice and casual. The pizza is so good that I've been here twice in one week -- once for lunch, once for dinner. Wide variety on the menu, but I've only had the pizza. Personal size pizza runs about $12, but has very high quality ingredients. They don't give you anything to start (no bread basket, etc), and you'll have to ask for water. Twice.

The atmosphere is nice, love the patio, and if the place is empty they'll seat you apart from other tables (plenty of places just like to cram everyone into one area). 

The only reason I couldn't give 5 stars was the service. Nice enough, but slow, and uncaring. The good part was they stayed away enough to allow for a really good conversation between all of us, not a lot of interruptions."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great tapas, and great pasta! The angel hair pasta is to die for and my other favorite is the greek salad with chicken. The chicken is so tender and juicy lightly grilled on the outside. Yum! Pizzas are small but perf size to get your pizza crave in without feeling overloaded! Water is served cold just how i like it without having to have ice in the cup. Nice dim ambience inside. They also have patio seating! Ask for Emily, shes awesome and is very attentive to your needs and cute!"}
{"text":"Sammy's, is usually my go to lunch spot. Unfortunately lately the dining experience has been a hit or miss on the food and the service. I usually order the tomato basil soup when it's cold outside. It's  absolutely delicious, the chicken hummus wrap is also very good.  All of their salads are absolutely huge and very tasty. Unfortunately their pizzas are very inconsistent. They have been either overcooked (burned) or undercooked and chewy. So be careful. Sometimes you can expect at least a 10 minute wait before seated."}
{"text":"Been eating here for 10 plus years and it used to be absolutely fantastic. It keeps going downhill though. Todag got a shrimp salad and the shrimp were so overcooked the were like rubber. Also the shrimp used to be big and meaty. Today there were some the size of my fingernail. The shrimp is pretty pricey to be small and overcooked. I keep coming back because it used to be so amazing. But today was the last straw."}
{"text":"Sharing a yummy salad and a pizza is more than enough. Fast and clean. Perfect for lunch. Less talkie, more eatie."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sammy's location in town. Even after moving across town I will still make the trip if I am in the mood for it. Has a nice atmosphere and great customer service. Management has always treated my family excellent, very attentive!

I usually choose boring pizzas like pepperoni, but I do enjoy the duck tacos.

Great place for something different."}
{"text":"First off I'm only giving one stars because I love their food but otherwise it wouldn't even be one.
We were a large party of 25 that I called in the morning to set up.  When we got there the restaurant was pretty much empty.  It was my daughters baptism so I had family in from other parts of town too we were trying to enjoy with.
Everything was slow from the beginning drinks alcohol bread.  It took forever for us to even get our order in and we told her from the beginning we wanted separate checks and who was on what check.  The waitress forgot drinks and food all night, seemed overwhelmed and actually gave one of my guests pizzas to another table so he sat waiting for over an hour wondering where it was and finally ordered French fries to hold him over until the pizza that was coming never came, he then canceled it after he realized she had no idea where or what happened.  The food came out here and there, one salad appetizer here, someone rises meal there, and the pizzas all took the longest.  We had basically ask her over an over for things and wait a long time for everything.  She apologized but after 2 half hours we decided to skip desert we just wanted to leave.  It then took like a half hour if not longer to figure out everyone's separate checks (which we asked for in the beginning) almost every check she gave out was wrong.  The other girl that was there even apologized again for the long long wait.  I just wanted to enjoy the day of my daughters baptism with great food, with my family and relax.  It was not relaxing or enjoyable AT ALL everyone was annoyed and hungry.
Won't be going back regardless of how tasty I think the food is, it's not the first time I've had crappy slow service in there but this was the worst!!!"}
{"text":"This Sammy's has an amazing intimate dinner atmosphere! I love the bar design. The food, service, and atmosphere were perfect during my first visit to this restaurant. My server was Julie.

Julie suggested an Italian wine, and I loved it. She suggested an appetizer for us called the Crab & Shrimp Dip, which has artichoke and romano cheese. This comes with tasty grilled flatbread. This was a great suggestion.

For our entree's we shared the Five Cheese pizza that consisted of smoked gouda, raclette, romano, mozzarella, and gorgonzola and the Greek salad consisting of Romaine, spinach, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, red onion, and feta cheese. These options were pretty good.

For dessert we shared the Salted Caramel Pudding. Yummy!"}
{"text":"It's always a great experience here.  The happy hour is awesome and plenty of food for two people to share.  I always go for the shishito peppers, hummus, fig and gorgonzola flatbread, and the brie with truffle oil and mushrooms.  I love that the also support local, organic and sustainable ingredients which make me feel better about what I'm eating here and what I am paying for.  The service has always been quick and friendly and some who have more personality than others make it even more fun to dine here.  This is one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Our server was so attentive. I believe his name was Russel? 
We came in a group of about 10 and we had the check split up a few different ways so I really aprreciate him doing that without being at all bothered. 
I had the lobster mac&cheese and I enjoyed it! 

The restaurant has a lot of differnet options so the group was all satisfied. 
Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Overall, I really enjoy Sammy's. I normally stop in for a late lunch during their happy hour (2-4pm), but anytime is a good time!

I wouldn't recommend ordering online. It seems like there is some issue with their system...call in the order instead. 

The duck tacos are so amazing! And the chopped chicken salad with kalamata olives is also a regular treat of mine."}
{"text":"Very good food, and great service for an airport restaurant! Ate a late dinner before a redeye back to Cincy. Got the sweetest and best waitress, she combined a couple pizza recipes to make me a custom veggie pie. It was delicious! Paired it with a draft beer, the perfect pre-flight dinner. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Too bad our server didn't announce her name. She was wonderful. Bubbly, attentive and patient for a party of 8 of us. Our party arrived in waves and she wasn't annoyed one bit. I had the chopped salad. Kinda heavy on the dressing and salt. Why is there a choice between olives & tomatoes? Why not offer both? She did ask us if we wanted our apps first. We said yes. But it all came with the entrees. Bummer. Sammy's offers something for everyone, small plates, pizzas, pasta. BBQ chicken wasn't bad, chicken was a little dry. Could've used more sauce. But the crust was good. Gotta love woodfire."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch. Ordered Brussel sprouts, ducks tacos and lobster bisque to start off with and the food was absolutely amazing!!!!! We got a pizza after to share with our 3 year old. Pizza is always good. 
Then we finished with the Sunday and that dessert was to die for. Out server Kim was on point! Drinks never were empty and she checked on us the right amount of times. The manager Carlos even dropped off our plates and checked on us as well. Everything about this place was great and we can't wait to try other items on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was amazing,  I couldn't have been happier with the service.  Our waiter gave us good tips about the menu, he  suggested the duck tacos, and they were surprisingly delicious. I look forward to going there again."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp angel hair, my sister had the cheese pizza and we split some truffle fries.

The fries to start were very nice they're served with a pepper aioli and they're very tasty.
The pizza was great! Crispy crust and gooey cheese. It's topped with basil and tastes very fresh.
My shrimp angel hair was a little disappointing. It's served with sautéed shrimp, mushrooms, zucchini, carrots and topped with parsley. The sautéed items were delicious and had lots of flavor. The sauce however was very bland and tasted like water to me. Very disappointed by that.
The service is great and everything else tasted great. Maybe their sauce station was just having an off day. Cooks please taste your food before it leaves your station!"}
{"text":"I had the hummus and flatbread, which was fine.  Portion and taste were okay - what you'd expect for airport food.  My mistake came when I ordered the strawberry lemonade cocktail to go with it.  When it came, after the waitress walked away, my husband and I had to laugh out loud.  It was a glass filled with ice with a very small amount of tasteless liquid.  It was absolutely terrible.  Then the bill came and I saw we were charged over $15 for what was essentially a glass of slightly pink water.  The hummus was $12 (it was on the appetizer size of the menu).  Bottom line:  the only thing this place has going for it is location to D gates.  If you want better food for better value, try California Pizza Kitchen or that diner at the top of the escalators.  If you must eat here, unless you won big in Vegas, avoid the drinks."}
{"text":"Great lunch.  Lettuce cups and chicken satay for my girls.  I had the New York Style Wood Fired Pizza.   

The order came out quick so I could go back to mi trabajo.   Alexandra our server was on top of the menu and our order."}
{"text":"Phenomenal customer service and dedication. I forget the name of the sweet, sweet young lady who helped us out but I know she deserves every bit of praise. Coincidentally enough, it was my first time EVER eating here. Will definitely come back to this exact location next time in town!"}
{"text":"Always great service and food.  I always love the duck tacos, lobster bique and the hummus and chicken breast with lettuce cups."}
{"text":"The Balsamic salad was delicious but it is huge - enough for 2. I also had the tasty tomato basil soup but the best part of my meal was the Chipotle Bloody Mary - it was tasty with just enough spice and was served with 3 large green olives. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Las Vegas. I love the BBQ chicken pizza. It is my favorite. They have tapas happy hour from 4-6pm 7 days a week. My favorite tapas: Crab&Shrimp dip, mini duck tacos, and coconut shrimp. They have the best spicy crackers."}
{"text":"My story starts out with a bad hangover, and me wanting to get some quality food.

I stumbled into the restaurant I typically go to during the lunch hour to get a gluten free pizza, and this particular occasion, I forgot to say Gluten Free.

I get the pizza, and an overwhelming sense of embarrassment washed over me as I asked sheepishly \"I forgot to say gluten free, didn't I?\"

I apologized and ordered a gluten free pizza after and explained I would just pay for the pizza so my roommate can have it and it doesn't go to waste and my server doesn't have to take the hit.

She took it off the bill, boxed it up, fed me lots of water to nurse my hangover, and made me feel less of an idiot for forgetting how to order my own food.

I left her a tip in the amount that the pizza normally costs after tax and tip. She did serve it to me, she did box it up for me, and if I could have eaten it, it would have been perfect.

She went above and beyond for me tonight, and I can't thank her enough.

I believe her name was Taylor, as well. Like I said, I cannot brain today. I has the dumb. And a hangover."}
{"text":"This place is awesome especially late late nights and you know someone who works behind the bar. Happy hour menu for food is like tacos here in LA but here you can order duck tacos. (I didn't stutter, did I?) Among other things you can order here but you know what? My gravy train is over as I heard our in is gone so it's time to get out. Nothing lasts forever but it was great while it lasted. Thank you very much for the hospitality!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  From the moment we walk in.   We got the wine side menu given to us, and no lunch menu.  We had to ask for the $10 power lunch menu.  That was advertise outside.  And the greeter took away the information that had the power lunch info on our table.  There were four of us, they only gave one lunch me u to the table.  And they didn't had it to us.  They put it in the middle for us to grab.  We had to request a refill on the drinks.  We had waited a long time to order our meals, and it wasn't even busy yet.
We had to ask for more napkins,  still didn't get any.
Never ask us if we needed paramesian cheese on our pizzas.  We had to request for it.  NOW the FOOD.   Soup was watery (corn chowder).  The pizza was very plain and not much of a taste.  Our group ordered one of each piazza.  All didn't have much taste to it.  

I don't recommend this place at all!  I rather eat somewhere else and get better service elsewhere"}
{"text":"Great food! Good atmosphere! They also have a 24hr bar attached which serves the same food and has a happy hour."}
{"text":"Its airport food. Had the Cesar salad with chicken. My husband ordered a pizza with pepperoni.  My salad came 10 min before his pizza. I thought that was odd. By the time I finished his meal had finally arrived. My salad was very over dressed so make sure you ask for dressing on the side. His pizza was okay.  Would not come back."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place today and it was nothing short of amazing!   I went with my omnivores and was able to get a very satisfying pizza for my vegan self.  There are not many places that have Daiya cheese and beef burgers on the same menu. Our waiter was very sweet and attentive.  We will certainly be visiting again.  I highly recommend this place to families with mixed food needs.  They even have several gluten free options.  We all left happy and very full."}
{"text":"I have visited Sammy's locations in California and Arizona. I am not sure if I forget that it was just okay or if there is a lingering hope that I will have a meal that changes my mind. But, alas, I had the same experience at the Henderson location. It was simply okay - a little bland, nothing special.

My husband had a pizza and the amount of grease on it and the plate beneath it was simply astounding. Now he eats a lot of crap and thinks that greasy is good so when he started soaking up the grease with a napkin, I knew there was a problem. 

I had a Chopped Chicken Salad. The chicken was lacking flavor and the olives were so pickled that they made it difficult to taste much else. The other items on the salad - lettuce, tomato, mozzarella - did nothing to make up for the mediocre chicken. 

We also shared the Garlic Cheese Bread. The seasoning was odd and uneven. So, some pieces tasted really nice and then other pieces left a bad taste in your mouth.

On the bright side, the waitress was attentive if just a little stand-offish. 

I am glad that we decided to visit Sammy's when we had a coupon for a free entrée. Even with the discount, the food was overpriced. So, unless you are just visiting Sammy's for the Messy Sundae, find another pizza joint."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good pizza at an airport. They bake it fresh to order. 

The crust has great texture, the cheese is good and the topping selection is on point. Service was friendly too!"}
{"text":"Nope. If you like wood fired pizza, this place is not for you. This tastes like frozen microwaved blah. No thanks."}
{"text":"Sammy's has to have been the BEST airport food I've ever had. We ordered the American Kobe beef burger and the mahi tacos. I was REALLY impressed with the tacos. I love the slaw with avocados and spicy tomatoes! Hit the spot for a late night dinner. 

Speaking of late night dinners, this is one of the few places, in Terminal 3 - D Gates, to grab food after 11PM. Sammy's closes at 12:30AM. Our flight left at past 1AM and we were stressing out that most of the shops were closing, or already closed, by 11PM. Thankfully, Sammy's was there to save the day! Our waitress was delightful and our food was delicious!"}
{"text":"What a great lunch after visiting the car show. We had salads and an incredible cauliflower appetizer. $44 for all that and a glass of house red. Service was fabulous. I don't remember our server's name, but he was number 2631 on our check. We'd come back just to see him, his service was that wonderful!"}
{"text":"Wow! We had a really bad experience here! We were really hungry and didn't have a lot of options for food because it was late and we were trying to get something close to a friend's house we were going to. Got a little excited because my husband is gluten intolerant and they have gluten free pizza! The problem is the GF crust just doesn't taste good! You'd be better off ordering pizza and just not eating the crust if you're GF (which my husband does sometimes). And they charge you extra for making it GF :( 

We also ordered salad & an appetizer & a couple desserts. The only thing that was any good was the sea salt caramel pudding, which was delicious actually. This place is like a really bad cheesecake factory. Or like Applebee's maybe. Really meh."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. They have an awesome special-soup, salad and pizza. Choose 2 for 10$. It's fairly busy but, we still got our food quickly."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to the restaurant in a long time, but I remembered how amazing their food was. Recently, I suggested to my husband that we should go there for lunch. 

The service was subpar, to be honest. However, I'm not sure that was the fault of any of the employees. They were short staffed for the amount of people who were dining. Our waiter had at least 6 or 7 tables by himself and a couple of those tables were outside. It took almost 20 minutes to get our salad. 

We also noticed that tables were not cleaned and tips were not picked up. I would only suggest that management staffs the restaurant a little better to give their customers faster service and so that their staff doesn't seem so stressed out. 

However, the food was still amazing. We had their Caesar salad and margherita pizza. Simply delicious!! We'll definitely go back, but maybe not during the lunch rush hour."}
{"text":"Just walked out os Sammys \"wood fired pizza\"..... It should be called Sammys \"Tapas\"
The new menu has 22 Tapas options and 13 \"wood fired pizza options\" 
The manager said as we were leaving \"we can make any custom pizza you want\"
I said \"no thanks, we will come back when we are in the mood for tapas\""}
{"text":"They built in airport but told me I need to have at least 40 mins to dinning. Even I do not see many customers inside, I do not know why they would be so slow. They do not suggest for take out or anything. Maybe if they just do not want people who does want to buy their drink."}
{"text":"It's lunch. I'm hungry. I want something healthy. It seems like every sentence starts with an \"I\" word. I'm not shocked. I'm vain, sometimes.

Ha.

Today, I chose Sammy's. I was out and about Las Vegas with my parents and they tend to be picky eaters. So I thought back to some of my friends who have special meal requests, and I lovingly thought of my friend Katie K. who introduced me to Sammy's a while back. 

Katie has a distinguished palate when it comes to food, so I figured this would be a good, safe place to bring my parents.

We were in the area, so I hopped on Yelp, got some directions, and Boom Boom Pow....we were at Sammy's.

Between the three of us, we shared two pizzas. Enough food for everyone on this light afternoon lunch. The vegetarian pizza (eggplant, peppers, onions, and such), and my all time favorite pizza (goat cheese, sauteed wild mushrooms and spinach).

Everything was fantastic. Fairly healthy, not overly greasy, full of flavor, and a meal that just makes you happy.

Service is very good, and the menu is quite diverse. 

I can't wait to come back for the Tapas menu!

Sammy's is going to be my \"go-to\" before big night's out in Vegas!

P.S. For you chain hater's....yeah, it's a chain. Mostly in San Diego, but it's a great one. Not a major one like CPK though. Local vibe still!

P.P.S. There is a 24 Hour Bar attached to this location! Score!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place so I was very excited to try it out.  However, I was not impressed. When I got there I was given a glass for my water and the glass was water stained...then came my food, um...it looked like it was clean either. There were orange streaks marks all over the white plate I had my salad on! The food was decent but if I do EVER go back here it definatly won't be this location! No bueno!"}
{"text":"Was jonesing for a salad and ordered the Greek salad. It was very good. Cold ingredients and lots of it. Never met a salad I couldn't devour. Friends had baked chicken with fingerling potatoes and veggies and they said it was delicious. Service was good as well."}
{"text":"Considering it's located at the airport and there's only few places to eat - we decided to find a sit down place while waiting for the rest of our group.

At 9:30 am they ran out of champagne, so that was already a disappointment. Our table ordered breakfast pizza, the pancakes and burrito. Another server advised us that there's no more pancakes and we just went to get a breakfast sandwich. 

Few minutes of waiting.... we were served with pancakes, don't get me wrong I was excited and took a bite as soon as I can but the sandwich came.... so now we're stuck with 4 orders. We didn't make it such a big deal but just then communication with staff and kitchen and staff all over the place is just awful.

I'm not very happy with the staff, unprofessional and unfair with other tables on how they take care of them. 

I might try it again.. I mean the pancakes were bomb!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years, but lately I've started to come less and less, and regretting it when I do dine here. 

The biggest issue is the service. It takes an exorbitantly long time, and it's been a consistent problem for me. I've waited ages and ages for food, even during non peak hours. 

The last time I ate here, they forgot one of our drinks, forgot to put dressing on the side of a salad, and then when the brought out the remade salad undressed, they didn't bring any dressing on the side, I had to ask three times for salt (we sat outside and there wasn't any on the table), and had to ask twice for simple syrup for my iced tea. Some of these were special requests, but a restaurant like this should be able to handle that. 

One of the strange things was that there were a total of 5 different people that came to the table. I'm sure this contributed to the inconsistencies we endured. 

It's such a shame because the food here is actually really good. Once we eventually get our food how we ordered it, I've never not enjoyed it. If the service was better, I'd be much happier dining here."}
{"text":"THIS PIZZA WAS THE DOPEST PIE I'VE EVER HAD! WHY AREN'T YOU EATING AT SAMMY's....RIGHT NOW!!

Ok, in all seriousness, my lunch was damn good today. I realize that my Yelp reviews are starting to sound like Kanye West hacked my account.

Popped in for lunch and had the pleasure of joining an \"Old School\" (kickball reference) with Arlene B. and Katie K....all recent Yelperazzis.

The good:

--Goat Cheese Pizza was perfect! The cheese was the right amount and didn't take over my palate.
--Edamame--Sprinkled with sesame seeds. Nice touch
--The crispy flatbread is delicious and has a nice little spicy kick to it. Ask for it when you get seated.
--The salads look amazing.
--The iced tea is bomb. For realsies.
--Although it was busy for the lunch rush, staff was very attentive.
--Solid menu. Lots of stuff for even the pickiest eater.

The bad:

--I wanted to brag about the pizza and thank Sammy's. I went to their Facebook page. And the wall was private. WTF! So much for taking customer opinions, feedback and such. FB is a good spot to do that. 
--Air conditioning. Although it was somewhat ok inside, I would've liked it to be a bit cooler. It's 110 outside. But then again, that's just me. And I'm not complaining....I'm just saying.

The ugly:

My fat belly. It was happy from my delicious and awesome lunch.

I'm coming back. Many times. And I'd be interested in eating my way through the whole menu.

The Happy Hour looks awesome too!!

Now that you've made it this far...

ISN\"T THIS THE DOPEST PLACE EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Never had the pizza here it was delicious! I love pizza and there's was great. Just got regular pepperoni and an ice cold beer can't complain!"}
{"text":"Taylor is the best bartender in town.  He is quick, efficient and remembers my drink every time I'm there.  I've lived in this town my whole life and not many bartenders can keep up with him.  He is proficient and keeps the bar clean at all times.  I continue to come to the bar area in Sammy's just because of Taylor.  He is the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Tried the New York pizza and loved it

Good quality for an airport and speedy service."}
{"text":"I loved there pizza but not how they have the pinnacle on the pizza, I felt like the pineapple tasted dry and it was too thin.. :( but great service in the take out department !!!"}
{"text":"Great service - rich menu - excellent gluten free options . Worth the drive if you are any where in Las Vegas ! Note this is NOT a sports bar but a classy,comfortable Bistro for all occasions. Also outside seating!"}
{"text":"OMG. Fleasback from back home. I had the tomato basil soup which is nothing like the over-blended stuff the serve elsewhere. Flavorful, chunky and just awesome. Then I dove into the labnih appetizer which comes with fabulous Zaatar (thyme based spice mix) bread. Yum. Great end to a Las Vegas adventure."}
{"text":"One star up!

After my most recent visit to Sammy's, I believe they are deserving of a better rating. 

As far as the food, we ordered the Kobe Beef chili, the kids' pepperoni pizza, LaDou's BBQ Chicken Pizza, & the Brie & Truffle Oil pizza on gluten-free crust. My boyfriend said the chili was tasty, but thought there wasn't much beef. All three pizzas were great. The Brie & Truffle Oil pizza is a new addition to their menu, and it was DELICIOUS! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it...

I still don't care for the location, I wish they had more visual marketing to show they're back there with all the offices. I still think that the tapas are pretty pricey (unless you get there for half-off happy hour). Regardless, we loved the new revamped menu (labeling all vegetarian, vegan, & gluten-free items), and service was awesome! 

Thank you for replying to my previous review. We'll be back. Hopefully during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Erica A. was our server and the very BEST server at that location.  Try to sit in her section if she's there.  She made our meal enjoyable and the service was fantastic! Great experience."}
{"text":"This was my first visit ever to Sammy's Woodfired Pizza. They offer gluten free pizza, but funny enough I did not have pizza during this visit. I did have the balsamic chicken salad. I'm not as sensitive, but it does come with blue cheese and pecans which are sometimes a concern for anyone eating gluten free. I was fine and no reaction. All that aside, the service was excellent even they were a bit busy. My friends did have pepperoni and BBQ chicken pizza. Tropical iced tea, I order whenever its fresh-brewed. It always refreshing. I would have to say that I have crossed over and now a fan of Sammy's Woodfired Pizza. CPwhat? The ingredients seem to be fresher at Sammy's Wood fired Pizza. I can't wait to return and try the pizza. 

Always happy to find another GF option."}
{"text":"Love Sammy's! Came in for Mother's Day and the service was impeccable! Brandon was our server and he was the most witty, personable server we've ever had there. Pair that with his wine knowledge and we couldn't have asked for a better experience!  Thanks Brandon!"}
{"text":"Sammy's lounge was a cool and quiet spot for a late lunch on Sunday afternoon. Tough decision since their menu is fairly varied, but we settled on the grilled chicken, gorgonzola, and sugared walnut salad, along with the New York thin crust pizza.  Huge salad, portions large enough for 4, but two off us managed to scarf down every tasty bite of the tender grilled chicken and greens dressed with a flavorful balsamic vinaigrette.  The pizza toppings were seasoned just right, lightly layered on a crispy crust.  Everything was satisfying, including the nice  attentive service."}
{"text":"Service was very nice and sincere. Food was amazing as usual! I don't go there very often but ever time I do it's great!"}
{"text":"I'm already not a big fan of marinara sauce, so I get it lightly. It wasn't as tasty to me. I also wasn't informed that adding bacon was gonna be $5 dollars extra I would visit this place again. I'll try the salad next time"}
{"text":"Pizza with no tomato sauce? That was it... that is all it took for me not to come back ever again... have heard good things about the place, but even the fact that you can only order personal pizzas, that made me feel at pizza hut express.. sad, very sad..."}
{"text":"We are never going back! We ordered the crab cake. It was cold in the center. We also ordered the rachlette, bacon, potato pizza. There was no rachlette on the pizza. Potato was the dominate flavor on the pizza. The service was poor as well. We asked for a Bellini and we got champagne with peach schnapps inside."}
{"text":"Food is ok but service not as much. We had grilled fish tacos. They were better than expected. 15 minutes later the pizza came. Margarita pizza was missing the fresh basil as described but had a taste of basil somewhere. To go boxes but no to go lids for drinks. Not busy so no excuse for the service."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in the airport.  Great service.  I got an English Muffin breakfast sandwich and it was pretty good.   Joseph makes a bomb spicy bloody mary!!! But don't say that out loud in the airport...."}
{"text":"We come here about once a month, so we love Sammy's. The kale salad and toasted Brussels sprouts are to die for!! 

I'm not sure why, but I've never done a review for such a Las Vegas staple, however, our waiter tonight, Markeith, was outstanding and is 100% the reason I decided to write this review! He was fabulous, made sure we had everything we needed, went above and beyond and was so genuinely nice!! Even if the food had been terrible (which it definitely was NOT) he still would have earned 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Pulled up to this location yesterday, and besides what YELP, and even the signs in the shopping center say, this location is no longer open, and has moved to Pebble/Green Valley. They will be open in late September."}
{"text":"My friend just kind of threw sammys out as an option for lunch without any planning or thought. This place looks like a good spot for lunch with a few coworkers but not exactly the best spot for families with children. We stood awkwardly at the front waiting For a table for for 8. Didn't seem like that much to ask for but we waited at least 10 minutes just to be crammed in with a bunch of other tables. I ordered the mahi fish tacos for $13 and wondered why we didn't just go to red lobster, I had no idea this place was so expensive. My friend got an artichoke pizza and said it was great. My fish tacos were pretty good as well. The other guests got burgers with no complaints either. I only gave 2 stars because the staff was artificially friendly. I didn't get sincere customer service that I always expect anywhere I go, not to mention at a pricey joint. The waiter was quick to try to get you another beer, but non existent when you needed a water or soda refil. If I were going to lunch with my boss and he were paying, I'd come again."}
{"text":"I came today for lunch with my partner
And we was so happy with the service,  thank you guys for such a good service and tasty pizza
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Loved it - the Feta pizza was to die for. I love that they have a gluten-free menu as well. The Caesar salad was delicious but way over-dressed, which is why I gave 4 stars not 5. The service was great. And they even have gluten-free beer!"}
{"text":"Okay food....service is extremely slow & wrong order was serve after waiting over 30 minutes..had to get up & ask for a napkin & had to hunt down the server to get a box to go & pay the bill. I can understand if the place is busy but around 2:00pm Monday the place is NOT busy at all. First time to this place won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Vegan pizza!!!  I love Sammy's Woodfired - they have Daiya cheese!  Just make sure to get the artisan thin crust if you're vegan!

The only downside is how expensive they are.  This place is a special treat to have once or twice a year, or to eat at if you're not the one paying :)

I'm still sad that they closed down their Centennial location, though.  Summerlin is pretty far!"}
{"text":"Awesome tapas, Amazing service, excellent overall experience. 

This was our first time here so we decided to try a few different items, all of which were excellent. 
Parmesan fries with chipotle aioli was a simple but good accompaniment to the duck tacos, shrimp & crab dip, and our garlic chicken pizza. 
The standout facet of our visit was by far our server - Snoopy D. Yes, that's her name. At least that's what was on the receipt. She was so helpful and very attentive. When my wife couldn't decide between the hummus and shrimp and crab dip she told us she'd surprise us. When she brought out the dip she ended up bringing us a full size shrimp dip AND some hummus. The hummus free of charge! This was an excellent surprise but it didn't stop there. After we were finished she offered us The Messy Sundae; we respectively declined. On her next stop, she dropped off The Messy Sundae and said \"I don't listen very well\". Again this was free of charge! Needless to say we will be back again!"}
{"text":"The pizza crust had a bunch of, what I assumed was, cornmeal on the bottom. It really detracted from what could have been a decent pizza. There's steep competition in LV, as far as pizza goes. Sammy's needs to re-evaluate their pizza, if they want to compete with places like Grimaldis and California Pizza Kitchen. On a more positive note, the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Cute, comfortable, friendly, cozy.  Great outdoor dining.  Salmon is wonderful here."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! We sat waited almost 15 minutes for our drinks waitress said she forgot and than after she finally got our drinks a minute later our whole order arrived even though we wanted our salad first, she brought the pizzas too! The table behind us the gentleman got up to remind her about their drinks too, she must of been having a really bad day to forget 2 tables at same time  when there are only a total of 4 tables with customers , also the cooks where cursing in Spanish is kind of sad I really like Sammy's I think I'll opt for a different location and hope for the best!


I received a message from the manager and they are correcting things! I will return to this location and give them another shot! They show care and concern about their customers that's what Vegas is all about ! Thanks for the quick response and taking the time to repair the situation"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but the serve is horrible!"}
{"text":"We had a coupon so decided to get 2 pizzas (pepperoni and arugala pear). I have to say the pear pizza is MUCH better at CPK. The reason I'm writing this review is that we were charged and extra $2 per pizza because we wanted whole wheat crust. Why should we be charged more money to get a healthier option? I'm quite positive that the process to make the dough whole wheat doesn't involve much. It should be an OPTION. For example, if you go to Panda Express and ask for brown rice instead of white, they give it to you FOR NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE. Learn from this, Sammy's. For this reason we will not be returning to any Sammy's in the future."}
{"text":"Great food but lackluster service. I've been here twice and both times (2 different female servers) they were not busy because we went at an odd time but the service was very slow."}
{"text":"Just came in with my baby.  Waited 5 minutes, with several servers walking by, and was finally greeted by a guy working the bar.  He apologized and sat me. Thanks to him! After being ignored for an additional 5-10 minutes I decided to walk out.  A simple, I'll be with you in just a moment would have saved you a customer."}
{"text":"This is really good Pizza!  The gourmet special with truffle oil is awesome, my other fave is the BBQ chicken but all the pizzas are good so good that I have not tried the pasta dishes and we have been here at least 6 times."}
{"text":"TAPAS AND HAPPY HOUR!  

lets see... duck tacos and crispy coconut shrimp:  SO good.
everything on the tapas menu is good.  down to the kobe beef hummus.  i'm not a big fan of hummus, but their hummus is actually pretty good.  

the mac and cheese is perfectly smokey and rich... and the steak skewers are juicy and tender.   these items alone are primo.

come with a group of friends during happy hour and try the tapas menu and share... you'll get enough for your buck for sure.

ps:  i don't think i've ever had the pizza here... [ha!]  
what i do know is that my son doesn't like the cheese pizza because there isn't enough cheese on it.. it's like an artisan cheese pizza with thin ass crust so he wasn't a big fan."}
{"text":"Holy happy hour specials, Batman!
Bookmarked this place for their HH: 4-6PM, half off tapas and $2 off wine or beer.

Restaurant interior is more upscale than I expected.
Menu is fairly diverse with vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options indicated with symbols. Tapas menu has several Mediterranean options, there are a bunch of salads, and of course, there's pizza- if you join their mailing list, you'll get a coupon to try a pizza for free (dine in only, with purchase).

BF and I were here for a light early dinner, got 3 tapas and a beer.
FIG & GORGONZOLA FLATBREAD: Yum, 4-slice portion with good balance of flavors from the sweet figs, salty cheese, and mild spinach, as well as a bit of pork? Adding a sprinkle of red pepper kicked it up a notch.
PARMESAN STUFFED ARTICHOKES: Good lord these were the table favorite, served in a blanket of parmesan crumbs with a cup of dipping sauce. 'Chokes had crunch and flavor, herb coating was light and complemented the cheese inside, which was mild instead of overpowering (as done elsewhere).
DUCK MINI TACOS: An order of 6 mini tacos, filled with 24-hour-marinated duck topped with cilantro, tomatoes, feta, and sour cream, HH pricing at just over $5? Amazeballs. I never would have combined duck and feta, but I love them both and here everything worked so well together in this dish. Fresh and flavorful!

Only thing that detracted from my visit was the service: entered and stood by hostess stand for quite a while before being acknowledged, and our server had way too many tables to herself and was quite frazzled. This was frustrating because there were easily 8 employees present, but I guess maybe they weren't on the clock yet? As 6 o'clock got closer, business picked up and the three women mobbing the hostess stand eventually started picking up the slack.
Normally I'd dock a star for this, but despite being overwhelmed our server was polite and our food came out quickly, and was amazing.

Fabulous food, phenomenal happy hour.  Even with a beer, total before tip was under $20. Will be coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"First impression of the restaurant was that it was so clean. Everyone seemed on top of everything. I absolutely LOVED the pizza. We also got two different types of pasta. Both didn't really have much flavor but i would 100% go back to try different items!! & more pizza of course !"}
{"text":"Half off tapas is amazing! My mom and I go there once a week and love it every time. The waitresses are so sweet and fast and their food is even better!"}
{"text":"So disappointed by their new happy hour menu! I used to love going to Sammy's for happy hour, they offered great portions at good prices (50% off appetizers). A friend and I used to meet here for dinner once a month, but lately it's been a while. 

The last time we went, the prices were about the same, by the portion size was about 1/4 to 1/3 of what it used to be. A reduction of 67-75%! For example, in the past we would get 2 full flatbreads, cut into 8 large pieces total, with hummus. Now, it's 1/2 of one flatbread, which they cut into 4 small pieces. 

I like their salads and overall the food is good, but honestly, the value just isn't there anymore."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  I get terrific service from Lea and Stefan when I go on weekends.   The pizza rocks and the service is always quite good.  I find the prices to be reasonable and the place is always clean as are the bathrooms"}
{"text":"This is the best place ever !!! Other that it's a very beautiful and comforting place to come and eat pizza with your friends or family, it's one of the best places to have a birthday party for your child.I had a birthday party for my daughter and the staff was extremely professional and nice.Everything was ready on time, organized tables. They even helped us to entertain kids with doing messy Sundays . Kids had a blast ! Pizza taste great, fresh and hot . A lot of varieties.I would recommend it to anybody.This review is for a Green Valley location in HENDERSON .Manager is the best !"}
{"text":"What a waste of time money and calories. $45.00 for an Asian sampler,lobster bisque and a salad. The food was under mediocre, price was kinda high ( the sampler had 6 items on it for over $14.00).  Now I know why we haven't been there in a long time. We wont return to much competition out there to  just be mediocre."}
{"text":"Sammy's is a favorite on my list. It is conveniently located near 215  and Rainbow South. This location does get busy around lunch and dinner peak times, so get there early enough to get a seat. They offer happy hour 4-6 pm on Tapas and drinks, always a plus in my book! 
We ordered the Parmesan crusted artichokes stuffed with goat cheese.Need I say more? Tasty and full of flavor.
For dinner I had the Mahi Mahi fish tacos, with pico de gallo and guacamole with a side of coleslaw. This is always tasty with a good helping of the Mahi Mahi. 
Our food came quick ,even at a busy time.
Our server was very friendly with a personality plus! 
For your dessert they offer many options , from Ice cream sundae's to cotton candy dusted in cocoa powder to our choice every time... Caramel apple empanadas-yummy! Sammy's is a delight!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience today! Our server, Skylar, was top notch! Drinks always full, she checked to see how everything was, and our food was awesome today! We come to Sammy's pretty often and this was our best experience yet!"}
{"text":"Sammy's is great for pizza, soups and salads!  Last time I was there, I tried their Kobe beef sliders and they were great!  I love that it is never super crowded for lunch and the service is always good!  The menu is varied and they have a little bit of everything - something for everyone!

Make sure you tell them if it's your first time dining - they'll give you a dessert on the house and it is ahhhh-mazing!  You really can't go wrong with a place that gives their first-timers a free dessert - that's great service!"}
{"text":"Delicious we came for a Tapas lunch and had duck tacos, mediterainian plate, chicken satay, 5cheese pizza good if you love cheese, lobster bisque. All good with the duck tacos standing out an lobster bisque I'd rate a 7 cause it was tasty and creamy not a purée or to tomatoey ,,, I'm a bisque fiend. Service was good !"}
{"text":"Terrible service, came in at 9:27 PM with eight people, place was empty and they said kitchen closes in three minutes and were quite rude!  We left and went to Firefly that was quite busy and had wonderful service and food there!  These place will go out of business because of poor service!"}
{"text":"This review is for the 24/7 tavern part. It's small and kinda dive-y. But I won money playing video poker and enjoyed a decent beer. The bartender was very friendly and attentive. There's multiple TVs. There's also tables you can sit at. You can order food too, of course. It's like a dive-y Sammy's restaurant you can gamble and smoke in. Definitely not a bad spot to kill time, have a drink, and/or grab a late night bite."}
{"text":"I enjoy Sammy's. It's a good, casual locals place. It's like a Chili's or Applebee's without the poor food and bad decor. And they have decent happy hour specials.

My three favorite things are the hummus (so yummy!), mac 'n' cheese, and goat cheese pizza.

The main thing here, obviously, is the pizza. And I have never been disappointed with any of the pizzas here.

The service has always been pretty good. And they've been quite accommodating when I've gone in with a large group.

The food isn't a culinary revolution or anything, but it's good."}
{"text":"Love this place! But pizza takes long time to come out since it is real wood fired! So i've usually went there to chill out with my friends while waiting a pizza and appetizers. Quality is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, and wonderful restaurant. The staff served my bridal party of 15 without hesitation or hiccup. The food was really great! Pizza, salad, and a messy sundae! Great job everyone!"}
{"text":"Unpleasant service and slow. If you order to go, they won't let you take a seat while they cook your meal, even if 90% of the seats are available."}
{"text":"Menu has a nice range of options - salads, vegetarian, pizza, etc. Service is always solid."}
{"text":"Vegan, gluten-free pizza. Vegan, gluten-free pizza that doesn't taste like sickly sweet cardboard covered in greasy plastic. Vegan, gluten-free pizza that is delicious and something you'd share with friends if you didn't already burn your palate shoving it in to your face?

This is a great place off the strip with delicious thin-crust pizza, with any of the options easily made vegan with their Daiya mozarella. And unlike a lot of places, they know how to get that bubbly, golden crust on the Daiya, so it doesn't turn in to a weird, goopy, oily and sweet mess that happens at a lot of other pizza places that so kindly offer it on their menus. I got the Truffle Oil and Mushroom Pizza, swapping the brie for Daiya, and it was probably the best pizza I've had in a long time. Easily in my top five for vegan pizzas.

Also a winner? Their \"Wok'd\" Sesame Shishito Peppers. It would've probably been something I would've glossed over by myself, but I'm so glad that my friend ordered them because I nearly polished off the plate. So good, and simple. Now that I'm back home, I daydream about them.

Great service, a lovely patio, and amazing vegan options? Love."}
{"text":"If your going to have pizza in your name, do it right. For that price on a personal pizza it's not worth it. Staff is nice and clean environment, but we won't return."}
{"text":"I wanted pizza but the bf isn't keen on unhealthy foods (food nazi!! Haha!) so we agreed to meet halfway at Sammy's. We were seated right away, drink orders taken and delivered promptly, everything was turning out great! We ordered our meals, I got a custom 5 cheese and pep pizza, bf got his huge Greek salad (which I shared) and decided even to get his own margherita pizza. Then I got a beer. Lol. Food was fantastic, service was impeccable. Our server Alan was ON IT! I never had to wonder where the server was, if he forgot about us, or if he just plain didn't care. He DID care and it was very present in every way. Good job Sammy's for hiring such a great guy!! Overall atmosphere and vibe was relaxed and warm... Pleasant would be the perfect way to describe a fantastic end to my fantastic weekend. We will be back. :) Great job Sammy's!!"}
{"text":"Tl;Dr- service sucks, it's pretty much non-existent, but food is okay 

Since I knew I was coming here, I signed up the day before for the e-club and got a coupon for a free pizza, with a purchase that is equal to or greater than the price of the pizza. 

I came here with a few ladies after work. It was after 7 so we missed the happy hour which is daily from 4-6. I was surprised they don't have cocktails, only beer and wine. We ordered the balsamic chicken salad and the red quinoa salad, and the organic arugula and pear pizza on a gluten free crust (+$4). The balsamic chicken salad is one of my favorites, it is bomb.com. It has grilled chicken, gorgonzola cheese, walnuts, and greens mixed together with a tasty balsamic vinaigrette. The mild cheese with the tangy dressing work so well together, the flavors make my taste buds do a little dance. The pizza had gorgonzola, arugula, pears and prosciutto. I thought it was too salty for my liking, with the salty cheese and prosciutto, but my friends ate it all up. 

Our server was the worst. He was nice and all, but he forgot to bring us utensils, water and extra napkins after we asked him numerous times. I eventually had to grab utensils off the other tables and find my own napkins, not cool.

After dinner, we ordered the messy sundae to share. It comes in a large glass cup, with vanilla ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces and whipped cream. When it arrived at our table, we grabbed our spoons and dug right in. This proved not to be an easy task though. The ice cream was as hard as a rock, so we had to wait like 10 minutes for it to soften up so we could eat it. I assume they pre-scoop the ice cream into a glass cup and then freeze it, which probably saves time, but sucked for us. I really LOVE that balsamic chicken salad and that is honestly the only thing that keeps me coming back here."}
{"text":"We don't make to Sammy's often seems a bit pricey.  Don't get me wrong the food is worth it and enjoyed everything we have had at this location.  Salads, pizzas, tapas etc...  We joined the loyalty club and don't think we got one coupon yet we have been able to use."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a quick lunch. Good service and food. Specially recommend the tuna salad."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. I had the tequila chicken fettuccine, and the calamari. Both delicious!!! And a Sunday which was very large and delicious!!! Love this place. I will be back."}
{"text":"Fine place to eat. Hostess seated me quickly - menu was waiting by hostess stand to browse while waiting the brief moment to be seated. Waiter was quick to take my order and bring my drink, pizza was just 10 min behind and came out hot - spices, but not an extraordinary flavor. Waiter dropped  check as soon o Lui put my credit card you. All fine - but staff seemed glum - communicating well in words, but not so much in emotion - almost had a little attitude. Visit was fine."}
{"text":"I am only giving two stars because our server was good and they gave us good service for having come in thirty minutes before closing, but our food was so disappointing. The lobster bisque was bitter. I ordered the margarita pizza, which I find hard to mess up because this pizza has such simple ingredients, but they used far too much garlic and used some weird tasting sauce. Their truffle fries were mediocre, definitely over seasoned. Their Greek salad was terrible. It tasted like they used canned olives in their Greek salad and drenched the entire salad with too much dressing.  On top of that, it was definitely overpriced. I'll at least say the service was fine and the restaurant was clean. Quite disappointing, and won't be back."}
{"text":"I had eaten at this same restaurant in San Diego, so when I came across one in Vegas, I got pretty excited. Unfortunately, this location wasn't as good. It might be because it's open 24 hours and it's in the worst city to live in, but the service was pretty bad. The pizza we ordered was also more greasy than what I had remembered, and it took forever to get everything. We ordered hummus as an appetizer and they gave us a huge serving of it, with very little pita bread which was annoying. The price and portions aren't bad and I liked that I was just the right amount of full after my meal vs. the usual stuff-your-face buffets scattered throughout Vegas."}
{"text":"Well, i was hoping my pepperoni pizza was going to be better than what ppl here have described(shoulda checked here first), but i just threw it up. I didnt detect anything while i was eating it, but the server (bartender) did have a tear drop tattoo near his eye, which i think means he killed someone previously. Im not dead but this next leg to DC from DFW is going to make my neighbors wish they were. Not a good time for window seat."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in their so called gluten free pizza. Ive been to sammys grill and it was amazing so obviously they are using a bad recipe or dont have someone cooking that knows how to make gluten free. It was cold for one, and tasted like cardboard...if u are going for G free dont.go here!!! Terrible"}
{"text":"Horrible! Thanks for the cracker that you all think doubles as pizza! It would have been great except it hardly had any toppings or cheese on it. I would give no stars if I could. You cannot honestly rave about their pizza here. When I complained, which I rarely do in reviews I found out they measure their toppings. Their is something un American about a pizza place that measures topings. Salad was ok...thats probably because it is really hard to mess up a salad. Save your dollar, go to 800 degrees or anywhere else other than this spot."}
{"text":"My dad and I had lunch here today.  We were in a huge hurry.  The waitress rushed our order so we could get out on time.  Pizza was still awesome and service was the best!"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week only for their salads, so don't be misled by the name as i rarely eat pizza (not they don't look delicious), their large variety of specialty salads they have designed on their menu is delectable and i for one especially like that they have the option to add extra thick juicy grilled chicken for a reasonable price. You don't know how many times at other restaurants I'm confronted by a waiter's bewildered expression like i'm speaking foreign or they don't know what to do, so they try  to charge you double. Let's  face it, if you're trying to eat right by incorporating salads in the usual method of trying to fill up on protein not fatty foods when you're dining, then i strongly recommend this place. There's only a handful of restaurants I can count where sometimes I can't eat the whole salad and these extra large portions can be a challenge. I wish they had these in Los Angeles, my other part time residence."}
{"text":"Skyler was great. She was very helpful with the menu and options because we had some dietary restrictions. The place was slow for a Saturday night but good for conversation."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I didn't have a great experience here, which is a shame, because I actually do like Sammy's.  We had a late flight out, and this was one of the only places open.  The sign at the entrance said to wait to be seated, so we waited.. and waited.  Finally, one of the servers noticed us and told us to just sit anywhere. We noticed that many of the empty tables were dirty, but finally found a clean place to sit. We then waited some more. The server came over and apologized, saying they'd been \"slammed.\"  He left for awhile longer, then came back to take our order.

I ordered the sliders with cheese ($12 plus an additional $1 or $2, I believe), and one of the \"fancy\" cocktails, and my dining companion ordered a Stella beer.  The food was just okay. The sliders were supposed to have some sort of sauce/aoili on it, but did not, just the cheese. A small container of ketchup was on the side; I had to ask for more.  My drink tasted good, but did not taste like there was any alcohol in it- just like punch. 

The cost- $50!  I have no idea how much they charged for the drinks, as the prices weren't listed, but they must have been quite expensive! I really felt like this was drastically overpriced, even for the airport, and especially because of the experience.  I'll know better next time!"}
{"text":"So satisfied with this place everytime I come, Each time I have been sat promptly without a wait, the menu has lots of options , just want to mention two of my favorites the hummus app. and Mahi tacos, yummmy to die for you will not leave unsatisfied! Portions are just right and not too overwhelming. They have a gluten free option,  unfortunately Wish the prices were a bit lower but this will not stop me form coming back."}
{"text":"I have been their late every night i go . the grave yard dude is realy cool . me and my girl always get a pizza a app and a salad and have never been dissapointed . place is awsome"}
{"text":"The other reviews surprise me. I had excellent pizza. Excellent wine. And excellent service. This would be my go to airport stop if I lived in vegas."}
{"text":"This pizza was so delicious. The staff was super nice and attentive. My flight was delayed and I had
3 hours to kill so I didn't might waiting for my pizza. I heard a lot of people complaining that their pizza was taking too long but seriously if you are in a time crunch why would you go to a sit down wood fired pizza place- it takes time to cook! Thanks for the great experience."}
{"text":"Best place ever. Get the mini duck tacos...damn those are so good ...sooooo good :P"}
{"text":"I went to Sammy's and ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad and it was Great. The chicken, the lettuce and the dressing was what I remember most. So was the Tropical Ice Tea which was very refreshing. I am looking to go back in the near future."}
{"text":"It's your typical SWP joint. No happy hour though, at least there was no signs or indications of it. 
Salads were good, no issues with them. Pizza was a bit colder than it should of been but it was still delicious. 
The food came in a timely manner, but the waiter did not give us water until we asked for it. He did however, check up on us once, so yay for that."}
{"text":"Sammy's is my new happy hour spot! 3-6 Daily with half off tapas and $2 of wines by the glass. Everything that Mike or Emily recommended was delicious! The service was engaging, fun, and welcoming. I'm going back today after making sure I write my review to go with the pics I took a couple days ago ;) thank you guys! 
Did this get posted?????"}
{"text":"It's airport food. I've come to not expect much when dining at McCarron. The typical experience held true. Not overly clean (pieces of dried food left on silverware in this case we well as silverware and napkins under our \"clean\" table) and no real sense that anyone cares that you are there. But I guess when you have a captive audience, why try?

The positives about this experience were the food - my Mediterranean-influenced grilled chicken salad was very tasty. The chicken was dry but flavorful, the kalamata olives were sliced very tiny, but plentiful and the dressing was light in texture. All over, a great value for the quality and location ($11). My husbands pepperoni pizza was also a nice surprise. The pepperoni had a bit of zing to it and the cheese and sauce seemed fresh in taste. We both had water and found it odd that both glasses came with zero ice. 

Our server was pleasant and while the service wasn't terrific, she sure was better than some service we've had in airports.

So, for the money and considering the location, I'd suggest trying it. They also advertise a dessert of tiny doughnuts with both chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces. That sounded delish, but we didn't partake."}
{"text":"What I enjoyed the most: 
Barbeque chicken pizza on wheat dough - they're perfect together

Other dishes were delicious too but not my favorite:
New York Style pizza - needed more mushrooms to balance out the salami, pepperoni, and Italian sausage
Grilled shrimp salad - very good salad that accompanied our pizza, will definitely order it again!

What dish they can improve on:
Duck tacos - go easy on the sour cream!

Service:
We came in a few minutes after happy hour had ended but our waiter was gracious enough to give us our first round happy hour prices! 


Why they didn't get four stars:
No beers on tap!"}
{"text":"The food quality has gone down over the years, but they have taken on a new low. We ordered the Cesar salad. It was drenched in dressing and the romaine was limp and old, which was evident from the red pieces. The prosciutto pizza with artichoke is what has kept us returning, but even that was a disappointment. The pizza came out stiff and cracked in pieces because it was so dry. The server had the nerve to act like it was fine, stating they now roll out the dough thinner. We had them remake the pizza, which made it edible, but it was not enjoyable like before. We did enjoy the sliders, earning the 1 star. We watched as our server bussed a table, dropping glass on the floor. We were appalled that none of his coworkers came by to help, especially considering the hazard it posed. This place attracts a lot of families with small children because of the cotton candy and messy sundae. Parents beware... When the bill arrived for over $30 it just added to the pain of our visit. We couldn't wait to get out of here!"}
{"text":"They are the best! So friendly, the food is always spot on, and so many healthy choices. It's always reasonably crowded, but never slow service. My go-to place for lunch on a regular basis"}
{"text":"The power lunch review. 

The Skinny: came in for power lunch special  but the food was disappointing (2) service: our waitress was pretty good and made sure our water glasses were filled (4) value: in the end,  it is all about the food. There are better joints that serve $10 sit down lunch. (2).

We haven't been back at Sammy's for a while. I think since they eliminated the pomegranate fattouche salad off the menu,  I really haven't felt the urge to come back. 

But we saw an ad for the $10 power lunch which consists of 2 items off a lunch specials menu (soup,  salad,  pizza).  Intrigued we decided to give it a go. 

We selected the tomato basil soup,  arugula and fig salad, the 8 inch spicy Italian pizza and the pepperoni pizza. 

The tomato basil soup was pretty bad.  It was tasted pretty much like tomatoes from the can. Cannot recommend. 

The pizzas were not what we expected. Based on the descriptions,  the pepperoni pizza should have red peppers while the Italian sausage pizza should have oregano and caramelized onions. No such luck.  The pizzas we received were single topping pepperoni and sausage pizzas. In addition to the soggy crust,  the slices were dripping with grease. 

The arugula salad was okay except the figs.  The reconstituted dried figs were kinda weird and too sweet. I think cranberries would have worked way better. 

Our server was pretty good at making sure we had everything we needed. Interestingly enough we were served our pizzas before our soup/salad due to issues kitchen.  Nevertheless,  our food was hot and our glasses were always filled. 

Long story short,  I realized why we have not been back in a while.... Once one of our favorite menu items was gone,  we felt no rush to return. After the food we had here,  I can see why. 2 starred review."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Fresh food Always! The Woodfired pizzas are the best in town. The service is great and staff is friendly!! Must get the duck tacos and the artichoke pizza!!"}
{"text":"Love the location. The staff is great big shout out to Shiloh for taking good care of us today. Food is always good! Staff is always super nice. The messy sunday is amazing and I love the pizza. The crust is perfect. I have nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"Food was good when we finally got it.  

Service was inconsistent from beginning to end.

We arrived about 9pm and we were aware Sammy's closes at 9:30.  We stepped in and I counted 5 parties and 3 of which looked to be finishing up.  There was no host present as we entered.  We stood around expecting someone.  I made eye contact with some of the staff but no response.  Of the maybe 9 employees there, we were not attended to for 5 minutes until someone manager looking comes from the back to seat us.

We quickly order some drinks and soon after order an appetizer and the main entrees.  At no time were we given any warning that time would be of any concern.  The appetizer comes in a reasonable time.  We finished off the appetizer in about 10 minutes.  We sat around talking for another 10 minutes and wonder about our entrees (pizza and salmon dish).  At this time there are only 3 other parties in the shop.  One of which was employees eating their dinner.  We finally get an update from our server saying the entrees will be another 2 minutes.  We wait another 5 minutes and I notice finally the manager like guy ask about the order.  Probably because I kept staring at him eating his dinner.  We get another update from our server saying it will be 3 minutes.  The server finally says at this point that the oven was \"off\" and had to heat up .  At this point we had already considering leaving.  We hesitantly agreed.  We get the food finally 5 minutes later and as I said was fine.  

Come bill time I would have expected another apology for the delay or even a comped item/discount.  But got nada.

I am just a little frustrated about it since we could have gotten a heads up after we finished our appetizer but we were left there trying to guess for ourselves what was going on.  I understand it was near to closing time but we were given no warning.  We would have likely not ordered a pizza.  Which I don't understand why the oven would have been let to cool off since this is a woodfire pizza place and was not yet closed when we came in.  

What would you have done bill time?  Of course we considered to leave no tip but that is not right.  I left a little but not what I would have normally tipped if the service was ok.  Am I out of line?"}
{"text":"If the guys in the back would quit talking and REALIZE they work in a restaurant located in the airport... it wouldn't take 15 minutes to get a meal!!! When you have 4 people in the entire restaurant"}
{"text":"Ordered lettuce wraps. They were served to our table dirty. With a sizable clump of black dirt on one of them. Sent them back of course. Fresh lettuce was then served. New York style pizza. It was okay. Nothing fabulous. Parmesan cheese is not fresh, Unfortunately. With all of the amazing restaurants in Vegas, it is highly likely we will not return to this one."}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews, but wasn't expecting this place to be as nice as it was. Upon walking in, I almost felt as if my girlfriend and I were a bit underdressed. The decorations here are top notch and you immediately feel warm and welcome once you're inside. The host was extremely nice and asked us our seating preference before bringing us to our table. He also reassured us that were dressed appropriately as they aim to bring an \"upscale casual\" dining experience.

Our waiter came by shortly after we were seated and took our drink orders of water and Blue Moons. We were partial to the tapas because they all looked awesome. He let us know that they were definitely worth a try but told us we need to come by again during happy hour where Tapas are half off and beers are $2 off. We were disappointed that we missed it by no more than an hour but ordered them anyway.

While heading for the bathroom, I saw that there was a basketball game on at the bar. It's NBA finals so I couldn't miss it. When I saw the waiter come by I asked him if he minded us catching the end of the game at the bar instead and he agreed and moved our stuff from the table to the bar.

Sitting by the bar was actually an excellent choice because we were able to watch the kitchen as they worked on our food. We ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese, Pork Dumplings, Crispy Tofu, Crab & Shrimp Dip, and Mini Duck Tacos.

ALL OF THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT. The mac and cheese was packed with flavor and each bite of crab was fantastic. The pork dumplings came with a great sauce that added just the right amount of punch to it, but the dumplings actually held their own without sauce. The crispy tofu was only lightly breaded, and was a large portion than imagined (Would cost only $4 on happy hour), the crab & shrimp dip was to die for and came with well seasoned Pita bread. There was actually so much dip that we ran out of bread and weren't even halfway through, so we shared the bowl...delicious. Then the mini duck tacos were piled with massive amounts of feta cheese and packed with a good amount of meat. Our only complain with them is that we dusted them off pretty quickly and would've of loved to have more.

The staff managed to hang out with us, rant and rave about the basketball game, and still maintain fantastic service. It was effortless, almost like we were all just hanging out. I loved every second of it. We got the bill, it was a little under $75 for 5 tapas and 4 (bottled) Blue Moons. We would've been around $40 had we come during happy hour. (5 tapas is also A LOT of food for a couple). 

All-in-all, I think I may have found my new favorite happy hour spot. $20 a person gets you 2 bottles of Blue Moon and stuffs you full of amazing food. All with incredible customer service."}
{"text":"Pizza, delicious.
Hummus, tasty.
Service, excellent.  
The greeter was nice and attentive. She asked where we wanted to sit and let us pick anywhere. The wood from the oven makes creates a good aroma. Ill be returning whenever I'm craving pizza."}
{"text":"Oh my god this place is full of yum. Boyfriend and I came in at 6, barely missing happy hour. They offered to let us order some things off the HH menu anyways which was pretty cool. Since we were waiting for one more person, we decided to pass.

We had the house salad which was so good, kalamata olives, red onion, red peppers and romaine lettuce with a balsamic vinaigrette maybe? It was very good with a good bite to it. Next we had two pizzas, the feta manouri on thin crust and the pear&goat cheese on whole wheat crust. Feta manouri was very mild with yummy feta cheese and a little drizzle of honey. It's not really too sweet and has a very good balance of flavors. The pear and goat cheese was AMAZING! Flavors just melt in your mouth. The whole wheat crust is very soft and tasty! We didn't order dessert because we were stuffed. We plan to return for happy hour and maybe some dessert..can't wait!"}
{"text":"Lunch was fantastic. My friend and I split a Greek salad and a bacon leek pizza. The salad was super fresh. Pizza was out of this world. Can't wait to return
 Cute servers too!"}
{"text":"I couldn't think of a reason to rate any less than 5 stars. 

Service: courteous and prompt. 

Atmosphere: Busy but not crowded. 

Food quality: Always impeccable. 

I highly recommend the tomato basil soup, a glass of the truly delicious house red, and honestly, order the balsamic grilled chicken salad (half order. Full salads are ginormous!). It trumps even the pizzas!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite brunch spots. $20 bottomless mimosas. Great vibes and good service. Definit. The breakfast pizza is also delicious, good appetizer to share for the table (4 people). Happy hour is also pretty sweet %50 off apps."}
{"text":"For having a bar, their draft beer selection is extremely limited to the usual domestics (buttwiser beers) and their cocktails are very expensive. However their food is pretty decent and it's nice that it's a 24 hour restaurant! Some if the appetizers are really great like the lebni and the fried Peppers. I love their chopped chicken salad with all tha fixins. Skip the pizza."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've had Sammy's and decided to try this location out since it's the closest one to work. I've been to 4 other locations before and this one was probably the smallest and simplest one, with only a few booths and mostly table seating. They also have a few tables on the patio if you like to eat outside.

I ordered the usual must have mini duck tacos and decided to try a prosciutto pizza. The duck tacos were wonderful and I was happy to be able to get the sauce on the side. the pizza was fresh and crispy and had a nice kick of garlic that wasn't too overpowering.

The waitress was friendly, but maybe overly so because she responded to many of my questions or requests with playfully sarcastic remarks. I would return to this location to grab a bite but it doesn't seem like the place to lounge around like the Centennial and Green Valley locations are."}
{"text":"Some co-workers and I were in the area for work and decided to check out Sammy's. I have been to other locations before but this was my first time at this one. Good service and delicious food as always with Sammy's. This time I tried ordering a salad, since I've only had pizzas and appetizers at Sammy's, and it came out huge! It was literally a mountain of Chinese chicken salad! The salad was tasty and not over-dressed.It's a nice place overall and the waitress was very attentive and kept coming by. I would recommend this location and would definitely return in the future when in the area"}
{"text":"My high from this place has worn off and now comes the sad part where you realize you won't be back.

Feeling kind of embarrassed, considering my out of town step dad, a total foodie tried it, and thought it was horrible. I couldn't have agreed with him more.

Order take out. Was told to give them 20 minutes. When we got there the food was Luke warm. Once home, it was cold. Duck tacos were drenched in sauce, the tortillas fell apart when we lifted them. Good but not good enough considering how much we paid for something we had to eat with a spoon. I swear, the lobster Mac n cheese has hardly any lobster. Lastly, the pizza was extremely greasy and cold. Making the cheese gross. The only positive were the fries and that's not saying much.

It's sad cause I was impressed with my first visit and the update was a real bummer."}
{"text":"Treated to a nice dinner by a friend. We had wine, Shrimp Salad and Duck Tacos. 

The Duck Tacos were so good. It had a white creamy sauce with a delicate taste, crunchy cabbage and mini hard shell taco.  

The Shrimp Salad was served with balsamic vinaigrette, Gorgonzola cheese and sunflower seeds.  

This was my first time at Sammy's ever and next time I will catch the happy hour, which is between 4 to 6pm."}
{"text":"After several bad experiences at another Sammy's location, we have finally found one that makes up for past issues! This location has a wonderful staff that seem to work well together and don't mind helping each other out. We have had several delicious meals here (with a 2 year old) and have always been very pleased. It's nice to see good customer service is still out there. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"had the new york pizza, and cheese bread. both pretty good. but not reeeeaallly good. a cool place to go for lunch or dinner, i always like places with out door seating."}
{"text":"This is a place I will be going back to often.  I'm vegan and there's plenty tasty vegan dishes on the menu and there's pizza for the kids!  They even have the option for whole grain doe and that was exciting.  The service was amazing and that is so important to us.  The waitress was soo sweet and knew what we wanted before we even asked.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with this place for multiple reasons. 
1. Tables were filthy. Ours was sticky and gross. We had to wipe it down with a baby wipe before we even felt comfortable eating off of it. 
2. The \"wood fired pizza\" didn't seem so wood fired to me. I've never had a wood fired pizza like it. Maybe it was frozen and then wood fired. I don't know. There was absolutely no char and it was soggy on the bottom. Both of which are not typical for a real wood fired pizza. 
3. Boyfriends pesto wrap didn't have any pesto in it. Hmmmm. 
4. EXPENSIVE!! $3.00 for iced tea?! Come on! We paid $45 for pizza, a pesto (sans pesto) wrap and two iced teas. Wtf?! 
5. Server had maybe 3 tables (seriously, the place was empty) and we saw him maybe 3 times. 

I'm trying to think of something good... But I just can't. Oh, I did like their sturdy Rubbermaid high chair for my son. I'll give them a star for that."}
{"text":"The angel hair shrimp pasta was the best dish I have had at this location or at any Sammy's. I decided to visit this location because it is much closer to where I live than the Sahara road spot. Beware of gift cards from Sammy's. Make sure you use the entire amount. They won't allow you to get anything just minutes after realizing the remainder doesn't get returned in a gift card balance.

This location was clean and has booths that are a step up from the main floor, which is interesting. The bar area is located very close to the kitchen. That is a cool idea so people can watch chef's cook up the hot dishes. Live action kitchens are always fun in restaurants."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and service was appropriately paced and friendly. Ordered hummus, BBQ chicken pizza, and Burrata pizza.  Pizzas are shareable, but marketed as individual; they're sliced into 6 pieces and we had half of both left over. 

The good: whatever pita/ flatbread they serve with hummus is delicious and burrata pesto pizza meets expectations (I also liked the crust).

The not so good: judging by the amount of paprika on top of the hummus, the container broke while that were \"sprinkling\" it on top.... there was a lot! Also, it certainly is not worth $10 for pita and hummus. The BBQ pizza leaves a weird texture in your mouth, similar to how an after taste makes you feel. I would not order the BBQ pizza again. 

Overall the food is good and I would visit again, but it is not as good as many other pizza joints throughout the city, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Pretty much tried what everyone in my family ordered and I can honestly say that everything is very well seasoned. I had the roasted chicken with the asparagus, potatoes and tomatoes. Very filling portions. The tequila lime chicken with the green fettuccine is also very good. Can't wait to try everything on the menu. Will definitely be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Got a recommendation from a friend that this place was a great stop for pizza and salad.  Definitely did not disappoint!

Sammy's offers some great menu items that all look tempting both in description and on the plate.  We've yet to see a bad looking plate come from the kitchen and always see new items to try just by watching other people's orders come out.

So far, my wife and I have been here twice and have ordered a Pizza and a Salad which works out perfectly for 2 people.  With pizza in the name, we figured you can't go wrong with that order, but the salads here are just as good if not better!

For pizza, we've done the BBQ Chicken and the Thai Chicken Pizza (TCP).  I'll say that I find the BBQ to be a better tasting pizza.  There was a funny taste to the TCP that I just couldn't put my finger on.  It had spice, but it wasn't a traditional tasting TCP.   However, the BBQ Chicken was right on target.  With both pizzas, the one thing that is constant is great tasting crust.  Light, flavorful and a great compliment to the fresh ingredients.

As for the salad, we've tried the Chinese Chicken and the Thai Chicken.  Both of these hit the spot.  Unlike the pizza, the Thai Chicken Salad was perfect.  Great taste, traditional flavor and just all around good.  The Chinese Chicken was just as good.  Both of these were refreshing, filling and instant favorites.

All around, can't complain with either of our visits and it's on our list of top lunch places here in Vegas.  The wait staff is quick and friendly and the restaurant environment is stylish and comfortable.  We will be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"They changed the menu!  My server tried to explain the items they no longer had.  When I complained and said I would come less often (i usually come twice a month) my server, Christopher R, decided to just walk away after chirping \"It was changed well over a month ago\".

The pizza I decided to order was horrible.  Needless to say based on the change in the menu and the horrible service that I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sammy's forever. Particularly at the Sahara location because they have a bar with gaming which is 24 hours.
When I can go to a Bar and get good food rather than \"bar food\" it's always a plus for me. I've always ordered the duck tacos or a chopped chicken salad. Some other things I'd recommend are the Kobe beef sliders , A Pizza or the shrimp scampi. They do half orders on their salads which I recommend for 1 person since they are fairly large."}
{"text":"everything here is really good i eat hear all the time!!  happy hour from 3-6 during the week!!"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a wedding and had some time to kill. Stopped in to have some drinks and snacks and we just had the nicest experience!
The wine selection is very good, service is super friendly and attentive and the pizza was so good! After the bartender found out this was our first time there, he sent us a free hot fudge sundae and told us he hoped we would come back again!  I stopped in again on my last visit, because it stuck in my mind how good they were to us! Their service has gained my loyalty....great job, great food, a classy place with a laid back feel and really nice servers!"}
{"text":"This place has some good pizza!
Love their 5 cheese pizza, salads and soups!!!! 
Good service is a hit or miss....
Def don't come here when they're busy, you'll be waiting a while. 
My kids love their pizzas and their desserts! 
Nice simple place with outdoor patio dining as well. 
Prices are reasonable 
Location is convenient while you're shopping"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure doing at any Sammy's and this one is no exception. Every little thing is great - from the food, to the staff, and even the music. Outdoor seating for when you're in need of fresh air is a plus. Happy hour specials every day. The appetizers/shareables are AMAZING! Too many favorites to name them all.... Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, duck tacos, the Baba, dumplings, lebnigarlic cheese bread.....i may have just named the entire share menu haha LOVE IT!! Beer on tap, a pretty good hard liquor selection, and wine galore. If you don't leave here stuffed, you're doing it wrong."}
{"text":"Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and grill was great! The staff was nice, and the food was greatly cooked."}
{"text":"Hunnie Bunnie Date Night. I had to convince her there were other restaurants she could get pasta at and not just the Cheesecake Factory. So I Yelped some nearby places and Sammy's came up. 
We decided to sit out on the small patio and enjoy the beautiful evening weather. She got the kids Pappardelle with marinara sauce and I got the Chicken Tequila Fettucine Spinach w/bell peppers, red onion, jalapeño, tequila-lime cream sauce - the noodles were a little overcooked BUT the dish itself was pretty good! I didn't think it was spicy AT ALL and I DUMPED red pepper flakes on it =) LOL."}
{"text":"Our server Johnathan was an absolute angel and made my experience notable. He was super polite and came by at all the right times and was very attentive. Even sent us off with drinks to go!! We sat outside on the patio next to the pretty fireplace.. The food was so-so and I wish they offered a larger menu for the pizza selection. Couldn't beat the price though!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been here in YEARS. I opted for a \"healthy\" option - the Chilled Veg Salad and I added a half a breast of grilled chicken. 
This was a pretty good salad!! LOTS of veggies and a nice dressing/vinaigrette on it. I loved the little mozzarella pearls and ate nearly the entire salad. 
I did ask if they had any lunch combo's like pizza/salad but they DON'T so yeah... Salad it was!"}
{"text":"Friendly place with awesome staff with really helpful waitresses and a menu that allows for not only vegetarian but vegan choices in abundance"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and so was the food.  The Flat Iron Steak was delicious.  We also had the wood fired pizza with shrimp with the nonfat cheese. The nonfat cheese was a great option."}
{"text":"Every Time I eat here I regret it. Finally yelping about it. This is Vegas, a city where amazing food is everywhere. Sammys just doesn't serve its purpose, the pizza is overly cooked, the salads are delicious but drastically overpriced and most importantly the service is the worst, absolute god awful service I have ever received every time I go and the layout is horrible. I won't be stepping foot in there again."}
{"text":"Stopped by mid afternoon on Sunday and ordered salad and cocktail. Food is good and enough to take home.  Only issue is male server kept calling me sweetie or sweet heart.  Which I noticed he did to all female guests."}
{"text":"Great Gluten Free and regular pizza. Variety of toppings. They also have pasta and great lamb, chicken or steak. Would definitely go back when were are in town again."}
{"text":"Besides a tasty menu using fresh ingredients and prepared fresh each day, for those on a tight schedule late afternoon or early evening, from 4 to 6 PM the happy hour half price tapas selections can't be beat. 

Ask Jamie the bartender for recommendations based upon your health issues or palate preferences, and he'll be happy to help you out. My friend who goes with me when I'm in town can't eat mayo or fries so Jamie made a great tasting healthy selection as a substitute. So, when I come to town, I try to stop when I'm in the area at least once. Don't forget the wine discounts included during HH 4-6."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place for an airport. The pizza is made fresh right in front of you. I got the pineapple bacon and my boyfriend got the goat cheese and added chicken, very delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the pizza is always very good.  But...since the new Galaxy Luxury plus theater has opened and they've started to get really busy the service has fallen off a cliff.  On our last trip it took about one hour for our pizza to arrive and our drinks never got refilled even once...very upsetting to say the least.  Maybe they're in the process of staffing up, because if not, they're going to need to staff down...all the way down, if you know what I mean ;-)."}
{"text":"I was really enjoying this in-airport Sammy's until I got the bill.  Our server, Alicia, was really friendly, attentive and efficient.  Our flight was delayed 6 hours and wasn't leaving until after 1AM, and she very kindly said we could have our table until 12AM.  

Our pizza (New Yorker) was really good as was my The Islander\" cocktail.  Unfortunately, there were no prices on the cocktail menu.  The pizza seemed reasonably priced at $14.00 (given it was an airport restaurant), but I was really surprised when the cocktail cost $15.70.  It was good, but not particularly large.  I felt a bit ripped off.

So, all in all, very good service and very good pizza, but overpriced cocktails.  My wife's glass of wine was $16.50, so I guess I got off easy.  Caveat emptor."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good service!  Great variety of food, something for everyone.  I even tried duck tacos and was pleasantly surprised.  Our waiter, Steve was also very kind and speedy."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour and I must say I left happy after an hour. Appetizers were 1/2 price. The chicken lettuce wraps and a cold beer really hit the spot. Good Stuff! Gotta come back to try the pizza."}
{"text":"This is overpriced crap.  The pizza was bland and tasteless with a terrible consistency.  The \"lobster bisque\" had zero lobster in it.  I paid about $35 for one person and I didn't even drink alcohol.  DO NOT go to this place.  Terrible."}
{"text":"Meh - I know this is airport food so I came in with low expectations, but Sammy's was not able to meet even that level.

The kitchen was kind of slow.  When my BBQ chicken pizza came out - I would say that it is a pre-made crust that had mediocre toppings thrown on it and they burnt the pizza.  All the chicken, cilantro, and onion was stacked in the middle of the pizza.  I also sat next to the server station so I had the extra joy of hearing the servers complain to each other about how slow it was.

On the plus side my server was friendly while she was at the table and checked back twice.  The Diet Coke had kicked and, instead of making me wait for them to change it, she grabbed me a bottle and charged me the fountain price - nice touch!"}
{"text":"Consistently professional staff & management who values our patronage. Had a olive pit left on a pizza which cause a surprise but fortunately not a cracked tooth. Olives are suppose to be pitted from the supplier, but one got thru. Warned management of the hazard & was offered a free pie next visit. It was good, but more important someone didn't get hurt from a unexpected seed in the food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and had a great experience. The waitress was helpful and knowledgeable. She had good suggestions and when I mentioned I had some dairy issues, she offered to go light on the cheese on my pizza.

The food was all delectable, from the beet/walnut/cheese/spinach salad (surprisingly good with a sweet vinaigrette dressing) to my Thai chicken pizza. Loved it. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Sammy's is a good place.  There's not a whole lot going on as far as charm or character, but it's got decent food.  They have a variety of tapas to start you off, a lot of specialty pizzas, pstas, sandwiches, etc.  And starting at about $10 a pie (these are individuals with lots of leftovers imminent) they're not too expensive. 

This location houses an attached bar that is a secluded and surprisingly awesome place to hang out at, whether you're having a meal or not."}
{"text":"First time here and loved it. Skyler was our server tonight and recommended some great items. She was attentive and seemed to really like her job (which makes a huge difference to my husband and I when we go out). We'll def be back for the brussels sprouts and the (as recommended by skyler) mini duck tacos. Great food, great service, and good atmosphere; would recommend to a friend 100%."}
{"text":"The salad was tasty (albeit a bit on the healthy-tasting side) and the pizza was pretty great. Not bad for $10"}
{"text":"A couple g.f.'s & I meet at Sammy's every few months for what is one of our tried & true, favorite happy hours ($2 off glasses of wine, half off tapas til 6p). Last nite, the 3 of us had 6 glasses of wine, 4 tapas dishes & mini donuts (not part of hh but so delish!) for $57. If I rated just last nite's experience, it'd get 3 stars, due to a major service issue where we were seated then not so much as even looked at for 10min. To my dismay, I had to be kind of a jerk to get someone to acknowledge us. But, from there, our waitress was very attentive & even checked on us right before 6 to see if we wanted more wine/tapas before hh ended. I give the sum of all our experiences there a strong 4 stars, though. All of the tapas items are very tasty. Going directly from our respective offices, we like the convenient location. Plus, it's not a wild happy hour that we'll be paying for at work the following day. There's plenty of room for those shenanigans but sometimes it's nice to just meet up with friends, talk without yelling & put down the cocktails for a glass or two of wine."}
{"text":"This location is always convenient. It's the one closest to my house so I frequent here quite a bit! Their staff is always kind and the service is quick. It's definitely refreshing to see a well-ran restaurant.

My favorite healthier items to order are the hummus and the chopped chicken salad. My go-to, if I'm not being so health conscious, is the aoli fries and the chicken tequila fettuccini. Yum!"}
{"text":"It's kind of unnecessary to review an airport restaurant, but consider this a public service announcement.

Sammy's is open later than nearly every other food option in D, and the waitresses are really cheerful. That's great. The Kobe sliders are brutally bad, though. It's not hyperbole to say that the same quality beef is available across the way at Burger King. I find it hard to believe that that is Kobe or any Kobe-like beef, it seemed like any low-quality supermarket frozen beef patty. And non-alcoholic drinks are $4.

BK and Port of Subs aren't good choices, but they're no worse than Sammy's."}
{"text":"Came during happy hour for lunch on a Sunday, service was fast and friendly!!! We ordered hummus and garlic cheese bread for appetizer and a chopped chicken salad for our meal and split it. First time here and won't be the last."}
{"text":"Great bartender/waiter.  Don't know his name but he has taken care of us every time I have been in there.  Great server and always kept the beers topped off and was very friendly.  The Kobe sliders and the NY pizza was amazing."}
{"text":"It had been a long while since our last time eating at Sammy's. We loved the location in Centennial Hills that has since closed. Tonight we were in the SW and decided to stop for dinner with our three children. What a disappointment. We arrived around 8:30. The restaurant was pretty empty. We were seated promptly at a sticky table. We waited a bit to order. Our server took our drink and food orders. Our food was pretty slow to arrive, despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't at all busy. We were checked on once during the meal until our server returned to offer boxes for the leftovers. My husband didn't touch his spaghetti bolognese.  My husband is probably the least picky eater ever and I've NEVER seen him push away food at a restaurant.  He literally took one bite and was done (way over salted and noodles that were mush). The fish tacos I ordered were none too tasty with old, tough corn tortillas and tiny, poorly seasoned fish. The service was shoddy at best and it was very evident that she was in a hot hurry for us to leave. We always happily tip at least 20%. Tonight it felt like a waste to tip 10%. A $90 tab for a meal and dining experience I'd have disliked had it been free."}
{"text":"Menu not filled with foods that sounded good to me. 

Service sucked 

Chopped chicken salad boring all lettuce

Mini burgers not even worth 11.50

I will never return to Sammy's!!!"}
{"text":"Nate was super Helpful and attentive on a Saturday night 

Happy hour everyday from 4-6
2$ off all beer and wine
1/2 price appetizers- still all large sizes 
We had (see pics) 
1) Duck tacos- 6 small tacos, tomato, Chinese cabbage, feta, loads of sour cream and fresh cilantro- I could see why people like this and grey deal esp during happy hour. Needs a little kick but they do have hot sauce u can ask for on the side. 
2) Mediterranean sampler- babganoush which was amazingly garlicky, lebni- cheese almost the consistency of sour cream (really couldn't tell the difference) with spices on top, and hummus. The flat bread/pita was served warm and crunch, with soft warm center. Almost like it was fried in spices. Super delicious and recommended 
3) truffle fries- super super crispy topped with cilantro and Parmesan and served with a large dollop of ketchup (didn't like it because I'm used to McDonald's fries- crispy outside and mushy inside). The truffle taste wasn't really there and mostly it smelt like truffle oil. Don't get if u like true truffle fries. But my grandma and hubby loved it, so to each their own. Smelt more like truffle than taste like. Didn't really taste like it at all. 

Other specials- Wednesday's 1/2 of all bottles of wine- see featured pictures"}
{"text":"At first when my boyfriend took me here I was not impressed to be going to a pizza joint by a Walmart. Much to my surprise the menu was artisan and the decor was bistro. I guess I was envisioning a Pizza Hut.  The food was great and so was the wait staff. Being a former waitress I critique everything and this girl was on point. I had the organic arugula & pear pizza and it was wonderful. 

I can't wait to go back so I can try more!"}
{"text":"Happy Easter! Bottomless mimosas!

Belated birthday \"happiest hour\"

Home of the \"happiest hour\" from 3-6pm every day! This includes half priced all tapas (appetizers) & $2 off beer and wine. Their service never lets me down. I always let my server know of my gluten allergy and they ensure proper food handling. They offer enough tapas to please just about everyone; from garlic cheesy bread to crispy tofu, and duck tacos. There are about half a dozen options that are gluten free (or can be modified to be gf) and also vegan tapas. Pizza crusts range from gluten-free, whole wheat, thin artisan, or traditional. The salads are ginormous!! And again, many salads (with dressing) is gf. Water, bread and butter are served upon request. They bring water out in a recycled glass water bottle with a rubberized pop top. Looks really classy and they take the time fill those bottles with their filtered water, just goes to show how much they care about presentation and service.

Now for my order:

~Baba Ghanoush- AMAZING! Well, that is if you're a garlic fan. For those of you who are not used to that heavy pungent flavor, start with a small scoop! It is very good and you can (literally) taste the antioxidants working! I get this gf so they serve it with bibb lettuce or gf bread (which is the gf pizza crust).

~Edamame- served warm with toasted sesame seeds. That is what it is. This tapa costs $6, so I would recommend getting during HH when it's half off.

~Hummus- also delicious and garlicky but not nearly as strong as the baba ghanoush. Again, gf style served with bibb lettuce or gf bread. Regular way is with flat bread.

~Oak Roasted Asparagus- Another brilliant tapa! They serve with shaved romano cheese, evoo, balsamic vinegar & prosciutto, but I leave that off. Roasted asparagus and balsamic is bomb! And the spears were nice and fat, very \"meaty\".

~Mini duck tacos- I was told was awesome. The plate had looked like he licked it clean within 10 minutes of receiving the dish! Six mini hard tacos are served with cabbage, tomato, feta, and a cilantro sauce with fresh cilantro.

~Red Quinoa salad- Another fabulous dish! Served as a huge mound that could be eaten as a meal on its own with leftovers to take home, that;s how big it is. The red quinoa is mixed with wild arugula, golden beets, tomatoes, avocado, red onion, parsley, mint, scallions, chopped almonds, and dressed with a citrus vinaigrette. It was so fresh and clean tasting, just a breath of fresh air. Very good and it was hard for me to stop eating. There was a serving leftover that I took home and ate for lunch the next day and it held up just fine. 

~Garlic Shrimp Pizza- First of all, I have not tried a pizza at Sammy's that I disliked. This pizza was served with garlic sauce rather than a tomato based one, sauteed mushrooms, bell peppers & red onion and of course I ordered mine on a gluten free crust. My only gripe would be that the shrimp were scant and the ingredients were strewn about the pizza. 

~Messy Sundae- This is their trademark dessert and literally is messy. They dip a large wine glass into hot fudge, filled half with vanilla ice cream and half with whipped cream. Also topped with caramel sauce and chopped walnuts and of course a maraschino cherry to complete the sundae look. It tasted as good as it looked! HELLO! Worth the extra calories, but it's big so can be shared between 2-4 people. Also, gluten free.

Their service is nothing but exceptional and the wait staff are helpful and genuine. I recommend going during HH so you get some sort of deal. If you sign up for their pizza club, they email you a certificate for a few pizza on your next visit. They also have weekly specials where there is something different on each day. For example, on Sunday's they \"Supper Sunday's\" where you get a tapa, a salad, and a pizza for $25, that's a great deal!!! I believe that special is good all day and not just for supper."}
{"text":"Love this salad and usually order it to share with friends.  The dressing is just spicy enough, and the fact that the veggies are julienned, including sprouts makes this a great summer salad.

Also, the Margherita Pizza (fresh tomatoes atop w/basil) is a delightful selection, with lots of gooey mozzarella cheese!

A tip if you are ordering take-it - make sure you allow plenty of time at this location, if your time is limited.
Try it!"}
{"text":"Thank you Sammy's for offering Daiya cheese! It's great because I'm lactose intolerant, and there's a pizza I can eat. The staff is very friendly and the food is absolutely delicious. I love this place and will never stop going here!"}
{"text":"We love the Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad, wonderful flavors and always delicious, big enough for two. We always get the Cheesy Bread with it which is actually like a white cheese pizza, fabulous!  And if you go between 4 and 6 pm the appetizers are 1/2 price. We've been coming here for years and have always had good food and service. They have a sign on their front door that they will be moving to Green Valley Pkwy and Pebble Sept 26th. I would follow them anywhere!!!"}
{"text":"Never had bad food or service but that was not the case at this location. 

Went in today for lunch. Ordered the Spicy Thai Chicken Salad and tea. 

The server brought us our drinks but not all together. With very little ice, it was the only tea I drank, never asked about a refill. 

We had to ask for a bread basket, which the flat bread was burnt. I'm surprised it was served to us, I know the guy dishing it out could tell, not sure why he still put it on the plate. 

My salad came - appeared nice. Unfortunately the chicken was dry and there was no spice. The dressing is like a sour viniagrette, no kick there or really that much flavor.. then after digging into the salad, notice a lot of the lettuce had better days earlier that week. 

Finally saw the server again, we asked for the bill. 
Will try it out again, most likely another location."}
{"text":"Everything we ate was fabulous!! One in our party is gluten free and her pizza was fantastic (mushroom and truffle oil). I had the borrata and pesto pizza and another had arugula and pear. Our waiter, Matt, was very knowledgeable about the menu and about the wine. I'm originally from Austin and am used to a wider selection of beers but other than that, top notch!"}

{"text":"All I have to say is that they charge an extra $4 for gluten free crust so a 2 topping 12 inch pizza is $19!!  That's INSANE.  I'll never get food from here.  This two stars is for the associate who answered the phone and was very nice about it.  I could tell she knew how fked up the place is for screwing over and taking advantage of people who can't eat gluten.  F this place!"}

{"text":"I was simply looking for a tasty wood fired pizza. After looking all over Vegas, this one came highly recommended. The people who eat here have NO IDEA what good pizza is. After walking in, my first thought was, \"this does not look good!!\" I should have gone with my initial reaction. The service was mediocre but the pizza was bland, to be kind. When you walk into a wood fired pizza place you should be greeted with the fresh aroma of burning wood, baking pizza dough and melting cheese. Not here. It looked like a Pizza Hut and had no aromas of fresh cooking food, let alone wood fired pizza. I ordered the margarita pizza, one I order nearly every time I visit a real pizza joint. What came out was not at all tasty. The tomatoes were cut too thick, making the crust soggy from all the \"moisture\" not steamed off. The crust, while a meager attempt at a Chicago style deep dish, was very flat. It had very little taste, had no hand tossed texture and zero crispness. The cheese was in sufficient quantity but looked like it was microwaved and tasted as such. The signature melted spots on top of a true \"fired oven\" pizza were nowhere to be seen. To give fair marks, it did have ample fresh basil, but much of it was older looking leaves with a wilt that should never be served on a true pizza. The second pie, a pepperoni, was just as sad. When we asked for a to-go-box for the last three slices, they were brought out in a clear plastic pastry box, stacked on each other. We figured this was their pizza box, but the table next to us got a traditional box. Apparently when you have only three slices left, you don't get a box. Do yourself a favor and skip this pie shoppe. You'll find better pizza at Dominoes."}
{"text":"Decent gluten free pizza. There wasn't any label so, at first, I wasn't sure I actually got the GF crust I paid for. If you order for pickup through the app, they may get confused because it comes through as GrubHub so they expect a delivery person to be picking it up instead of you.

Edited to add the passive aggressive note I got from someone at the store after putting up this review that took it from three stars to one."}
{"text":"I came in to order a pizza to go for lunch.  the young man at the bar took my order friendly and attention  His manager was professional and customer service was a 10.   woukd recomend this location"}
{"text":"Typical in my travel style I got to airport EARLY to beat the TSA lines, and the hassle of waiting - plus love US airports for the shopping !! 

Ordered the breakfast pizza with ham, tomatoes, egg, onions and cheese. (That's exactly how the menu words this pizza). 

The place is more of a lunch / snack and dinner type of restaurant at the airport but they do have a couple breakfast items. 

Well pizza arrived with bacon as well (not cooked well done so it was raw/fatty like), and the eggs were scrambled - what jack ass thought that was a good idea. In my mind I saw a fried egg on top of the pizza in the middle as many places do... But not here. Anyway, not to my liking - I kind of picked toppings off and ate those for breakfast.

With that being said let's move to the service side is Sammy's. HORRIBLE !!! My server was more concerned about not missing any of the staff gossip as 7 staff members talked openly in the restaurant  floor about customers, other staff members, and whatever else. They don't have cream or milk for coffee but rather go over to the Starbucks pour some in a plastic cup and pour it into your coffee she actually didn't even see people coming in and sitting down. She passed by my table many times and seeing I was finished didn't ask if I wanted more coffee or how anything was. Finally I flagged her down for my bill actually had to ask again two more times because she got caught up talking with coworkers. Paid for my meal even though it wasn't really even eaten. 
My advise - skip Sammy's and walk over to Starbucks or Rachel's kitchen for something better."}
{"text":"I love how their server's personalities are consistent. They really like to connect. :)"}
{"text":"Firstly, I have had many pleasant experiences at this Sammy's Woodfired Pizza location. As a college student, I frequent Sammy's happy hour where tapas are half off. My boyfriend, myself, and my mother have spent many birthdays at Sammy's and are members of the Sammy's Pizza \"vip club\", which is just a program a customer can sign up for to receive special offers on purchases. 

However, today (July 22, 2017 at 4:01 p.m.) I placed an order for two mini duck taco tapas to go. Happy hour is from 4-6 as listed on Sammy's website. Which means half off of each tapas order. I have ordered to go orders during this specific happy hour before and had zero issues with receiving the happy hour discount. Even the Sammy's website DOES NOT indicate DINE IN customers ONLY receive happy hour on tapas or \"shareables\". I will attach a screenshot of this below. 

Nonetheless, this time was trifling in terms of customer service and sticking to the company policy as listed on the website. I was told I could NOT receive the tapas discount on to go orders since that is their policy. I insisted that I had been to this Sammy's pizza location many, many, times and have received the happy hour price. A rude red head woman, (who would not give me her name), insinuated that I was lying and that \"no one here has ever done that\". I was shocked! I would not lie about something like this because, I enjoy eating Sammy's Woodfired food, especially the delicious duck tacos. 

Then I told the red headed woman, that \"it was fine and that I no longer wanted the tacos\". More specifically, I stated that I will \"just call corporate to address my concerns with customer service\". She rolled her eyes and said something under her breath. That really infuriated me, to which I said, \"If you have something to say, say it to my face\". She went on to say, \"your the one who walked in here all apprehensive\". Umm, EXCUSE ME, I walked in HAPPY to HAPPY hour to purchase my duck tacos; until I was not given the USUAL happy hour discount. 

One woman, named Skylar went to the defense of the red headed woman (that again would not give me her name). Again, Skylar insisted that \"they\", NEVER did half off to go happy hour shareables. She asked who had given me the happy hour price before. I explained to her, \"I have come in SO many times for these duck tacos that I cannot remember every single server who gave me the valid happy hour price\". Skylar has seen me come in and rang up my happy hour order before and now wants to act oblivious (management can check the cameras for the past few months and see that I have come in and purchased food both dine in and carry out at happy hour). What a nice way to treat a repeat, paying, customer. 

Then, the manager, Anthony, came out and said \"well maybe they did you a FAVOR, but this is our policy NOW\". What do you mean by NOW? I told him, I was told by Skylar that their policy was \"always no discount on to go orders\". So which is it?! Was I, a paying customer done \"a favor\", or has the policy ALWAYS been the same? He changed his response to \"oh its not new, its always been the same\". So disgustingly unprofessional, to claim I was done \"favors\" in the past. Sammy's Woodfired Pizza desperately needs to educate their employees on customer service. 

After being throughly embarrassed and accused of being a liar, I told the staff to \"enjoy their duck tacos\", and I walked out. So much for happy hour. 

I have contacted corporate and await a response."}
{"text":"I'm not really a pizza person.  The kind of pizza I like are like Sammy's!  I love CPK pizza.  So sammy's is very similar.  I did hear that its a chain pizza spot affiliated or owned by CPK?  Go figure why i liked it.

My doc at worked ordered it for lunch.  Thai, mozzarella, veggies, bbq were the four types of pizza they got.

The thai pizza was good, but there were whole peanuts in it.  It was okay.  Maybe I would like it if it was half of it sprinkled on top.  The texter made it real crunchy. LOL!

The veggie was my favorite.  

The salad's lettuce were chopped up (love my salads this way) with chicken. The problem was the dressing was just so tart! I almost teared!

Next time for sure I have to dine in."}
{"text":"\"Healthy Global Cuisine.\" I like healthy food. I like food from around the globe. But I wasn't a huge fan of their global cuisine offerings. At first glance I thought this restaurant was having an identity crisis. Not quite Italian, not quite Asian, not quite greek, not quite fusion... so it just came out not quite good. 
I ordered the Oak roasted salmon filet. It was cooked perfectly which I give them credit for however it was sitting a top an \"Asian edemame salad\" which was swimming in a pool of ponzu sauce. The Ponzu flavor just completely overpowered the dish. They should call it Ponzu soup with some edemame. Ruined the dish for me.
My husband got the pizza, can't really go wrong there. But there are many other restaurants that can fire up a good pizza."}
{"text":"Great place good food. Good service. What more can you ask for. Good spot to go with small group or large. Dimmer lights and soft music. It's a great place to go for food. Ask for Allie as your server she is a doll :)"}

{"text":"I had Sammy's for the first time at a meeting today. I called in the order and Jim was super friendly and helped me choose the perfect dishes for our group. The food was amazing! My fave was the vegetarian pizza. I've been wanting to try this place out, I will be going back with my family, not only because of the great food but also because of the great service."}
{"text":"The woodfired pizzas here are all good and I mean all of them. The surroundings are classy with a lot of open space in the dining area.
They have lobster bisque. I don't think I need to say anymore
I go here on every trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"I definitely think the pizza is flavorful and portions are adequate, however every time I've gone to this location the waiter/waitress has messed up some part of my order. They are personable and nice, but that doesn't compensate for the fact they have never gotten a simple order correct. The service time is poor and the Resteraunt is noisy. But I would go back because of sheer flavor!"}
{"text":"One of the best Happy Hours in town. 4-6pm Half off all the Tapas (apps) and their beer and wine. We brought the family in and ordered a bottle of wine, and six tapas and walked out stuffed for under $45.00."}
{"text":"I had the Margarita pizza, chopped chicken salad, and the crab & shrimp appetizer. I wish the appetizer would have come before our meal. The service was fine. The manager came to see how everything was, we told him great, except for the Trance Music which was playing too  loud in the background. That was irritating, not relaxing."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for Happy Hour the yesterday. They have happy hour everyday from 4-6pm and again the bar area from midnight till 8am. All tapas are half price. we got skewers, pot stickers, coconut shrimp and lettuce wraps with a couple of soft drinks for 25 bucks. Food was very good. Service and price were great. We also tried their new desert which was warm donuts. The waiter said since it was our first time trying it it was on him. Cant beat it. Will defiantly be back very soon for more tapas."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Sammy's in San Diego lot of times, I love it. Tonight we felt like having pizza, I suggested a place in Summerlin that we love, but it is a bit to far from our house. We order take out from Sammy's and became very sad when we arrived home. We ordered the New York pizza, and the Balsamic chicken salad. The pizza did not live up the 13 dollars that it cost and the salad was wilty. I hope I don't wake up at 2am vomiting out of control.  :("}
{"text":"I love this place. we go almost three times a month. their shrimp pizza is to die for. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars, is because they're take out is always way less then their actual serving portions. However the staff is very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Our waiter Mentor, was a very nice, pleasant man.  He was accurate with our order and had great suggestions for our dinner. 
We had the balsamic grilled chicken Salad and a pepperoni, sausage, onion and dried tomato pizza. It was AMAZING!!!!
Great experience, nice night out to eat outside (which we did), over all a wonderful dinner!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fish taco lover so when I say these are the best fish tacos everrrrr omg...I love the flavors that the wood fire gives the food. Absolutely amazing and to top it off the service is incredible. I went to grab some last minute gifts from the shop and when my food was ready the lovely waiter came to the store just to let me know my food was ready. Throughout my meal she made sure I was enjoying my experience. Alicia is Very professional and genuine. That's hard to come by these days so I sincerely appreciated Alicia and her service she's outstanding and the chefs prepared an amazing meal. 

-one happy ass customer!!!!,

{"text":"Terminal D! It's just good... Not fancy... Just good... Not like you've many choices in this airport, but if you're going to eat anywhere and you want pizza, beer, salads? Go here."}
{"text":"I would give a terrific food review as well as good service -but the music in this restaurant is so annoying to listen to while your trying to eat - complaining does no good as we were told management wants it and people have been complaining for three years ?
Very very odd .oh well I guess we will go to California pizza kitchen instead ."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I would have to thank Cheska for taking us here and for Dave's incredible hospitality. 

After a night of drinks and karaoke (where one guy thought Linkin Park was some sort of Death Metal group the way he sang \"In The End\"), we were convinced to come here by Cheska at the mere mention of \"tacos\". Oh, not just ordinary tacos mind you, but duck tacos. Yes, the aquatic fowl that is wildly enjoyed by this Yelper.

Lo and behold to our surprise, after hours, they have their own set of Happy Hour type pricing and serve tapas (which the duck tacos are a part of).

You'll have to excuse my lapse in memory, I had more than a couple of beers prior to getting here and then some when we did get here, heh. 

Sirloin Skewers, drizzled with a sweet teriyaki glaze - it was bit on the sweet side, and the beef being a little tough, but it was still good and wasn't overly sweet/drowned out by the sauce

Mousakka - with nicey spiced lamb (which I normally don't care for) and melted cheese, but this was really good served with pita bread

Duck Tacos - shredded duck meat, in a small hard corn shell, served with chopped up veggies and a cilantro type sauce; it was good, a bit on the small side, but it wasn't something that would knock you off your feet, still one of my favorite things we got

I also believe we got other dishes, but again, my mind was too cloudy to remember. I do remember, that everything was decently good (I know I was drunk, but even I know what tastes good or not). I wouldn't mind coming back here in the wee hours of the night/morning to meet up with Dave again. Good food, GREAT company (friends and Dave). I had no problem that when we did leave, the sun was coming up and I wouldn't mind doing that again."}
{"text":"Maybe its because I went here to eat a pizza and not save the rainforest or the cow that I enjoyed it!  (You have to wonder about some reviewers)

Been here several times and always enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and friendly servers.

Just need to make sure you never get a booth or a table near the restrooms.  If they try to seat you to the right as you walk in, refuse... The bathrooms are there and the chemical smell filters back in that area.  

Against the windows is excellent to see the kitchen the people and outside.  

I had the new York Pizza and my GF had a salad.  The pizza was crisp and spicy, yet flavorful.  Not the chemical spicy, but spice from the ingredients used.  I like that.  

 The salad was large, fresh and filled with what was promised..  Something you don't always see elsewhere.  

We both enjoyed the meal.  They were busy but did not rush you out the door once you got down to the last bites.  I liked that.  Able to sit and relax after the meal and enjoy the company."}
{"text":"I've had Sammy's a few times, usually \"to go\". Today I decided to have a sit down and eat. We came in just in time for Happy Hour! What are the odds of that! 3-6pm daily, half off all tapas and $2 off alcoholic beverages. If I didn't forget my ID I would of taken advantage of the drinks. The tapas menu is pretty intriguing as well. 

I decided on the Lobster Mac & Cheese, which was about $5. It was the perfect amount. Considering it is a pasta so it's pretty heavy I decided not to get another item for myself. It had a good amount of Lobster in it. It wasn't TOO cheesy. And the dish wasn't as small as I thought it would be. 

The beau got the garlic chicken pizza. Besides the fact that it came with mushrooms and I accidentally ate one, it was pretty delicious. I loath mushrooms! It definitely had a woodfire taste to it. It was thin crust which I loved. 

Service was alright. She came and got our orders quickly but we didn't see our waitress the rest of the time. And our check took forever to arrive. Other than that I love Sammy's!"}
{"text":"I love their Balsamic Chicken Salad! I've always had great service and when I have guests from out of town I always bring them to Sammy's!"}
{"text":"Worst cocktails I've tasted. Ordered the chicken salad with walnuts, gorgonzola and balsamic dressing and the salad was DRENCHED with salad dressing. Soaking wet! Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"love this place the Chinese chicken salad its best. BOMB!"}
{"text":"Sammy's Woodfired Pizza is a reasonable choice for salads and pizza.  Also a good option for families.

I generally have had good service here, and this restaurant offers options that will appeal to a wide range of people - somewhat middle of the road - solid food and service, but nothing unique or remarkable.

The salads are particularly good in my opinion (chopped salad and green salad with walnuts, chicken and balsamic vinegarette) and they are large, a large salad can easily be shared by 4-6 people, a small by 2-3 people.

Pizzas are good but not spectacular - again - solid but nothing groundbreaking.  Some good options for variety here.

Good restaurant for families and kids.  Outdoor seating here is nice, weather permitting, although a bit loud as this location is right under the flight path from McCarran Airport."}
{"text":"Out of all the places I used to work, Sammy's is probably the one I come back to the most. I can't get enough of their amazing duck tacos and the ingredients in the good are always fresh! They sure know how to pack flavor in the salads. For pizza I would have to go the artisan route though, I like I pie thin and crispy! Definitely worth visiting on your lunch hour or after the gym."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I ate here and that was the Sahara location so I had to give this place another shot since it's walking distance from my home. What really brought me in was the happy hour 50% tapas and drinks. I was really surprised at how good the food was! We loaded up on the tapas menu, got ourselves a BBQ chicken pizza and a couple of beers to wash it all down and the bill was just $30 something! We had so much food we barely touched the pizza so we brought that baby home of course :-) 

I enjoyed the waitress too...I forgot her name but she was super friendly, sweet and on it without hovering over us. It's walking distance so for sure I will be coming back to indulge some more ;-)"}
{"text":"Yuck! Expensive and bad for breakfast.  Was that bacon? Eggs even tasted bad.  I'm surprised they didn't charge for water.  Go to Starbucks or Rachel's Kitchen."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Sahara location and been satisfied with Sammy's before.  This being my first visit to this location I expected around the same enjoyment.  Let me start by saying the service and the restaurant were both excellent.  Clean restaurant that wasn't cluttered and had a great overall ambiance.

The menu had several choices and for a woodfire pizza place certain items seemed out of place.  A lot of seafood and greek style apps.  \"Tapas\" had a spot on the menu and consisted of things like Artichoke dip and Edamame??? Ok, not Firefly tapas for sure but still small plates... I guess.  The woodfire pizza that stuck out to me was the prosciutto.  At Settebello its my favorite so I figured I would compare.

No comparison needed, Settebello's prosciutto kills what I just ate.  The pizza wasn't terrible but it wasn't great in the same sense.  Little chunks of prosciutto and an over abundance of artichoke and green onion to mask the flavor of the prosciutto.  Also, if you look and the photo I uploaded you can tell there are way too many green onions on a couple of pieces than others.

For those movie fans out there, you all know from Casino with De Niro and Pesci \"you need an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin\" hahaha.  Overall, just didn't stick out as a place I would ever return to for pizza and its in the freakin name of the restaurant.... come on!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for late night eats after being out and about in Town. The Bartender Chance was Amazing!  This place is amazing!!  Kobe appetizers were off the hook!   Great deal, great vibe, will most def come back."}
{"text":"The service was mediocre.   Drinks were not re-filled very quickly at all and I was sucking on ice a lot.   And I can't really speak to the pizza since my entire table ordered salads.

My chicken caesar wasn't bad.  I probably would have preferred more caesar dressing, and for the extra $4 or $6 for half chicken (I forget the exact amount), a little better job on that, but overall, it was a good salad.

Good for lunch, but it's a little bit on the pricey end for salads (over $10 for just the salad).  It was a huge portion, but then again, it wasn't like some seriously pricey greens."}
{"text":"Finally, I try Sammy's!  It was well worth the wait.  We arrive around 7pm on a week night.  The place is pretty steady.  We're seated.  So far, so good.  

Our drink orders arrive in a timely manner.  Sip, sip.  Now we have a dilemna, what to order.  I play it safe and get the Garlic Cheese Bread for an appetizer and Caesar salad for an entree.  The fiance orders the Brie Cheese w/Truffle Oil Thin Crust Pizza.  The cheese bread arrives and tastes alright.  Good start!  My salad arrives and looks pretty good--large and fresh.  Bite, munch, chomp, ewwwwwwwwwww.  Looks are deceiving.  I don't know what it was about their dressing but it tasted gross!  Slightly fishy is okay but just gross.  I eat about seven forks-worth to see if the taste would change, nope. Yuck!  The Brie Cheese w/Truffle pizza arrives and looks so-so.  Very bland and overloaded with truffle oil.  Half of it was forcefully eaten.

Our server was pleasant and asked how our food was.  We sincerely replied \"It's okay.\"  She definitely noticed we weren't very happy with the food.  Hmm, kind of disappointing that she offered no remedy.  Later, she asked if she could box up our leftovers but we declined.  She again asked, \"Was everything okay?\"  We let her know we didn't like the taste of our food, particularly the salad and the pizza.  She apologizes but we  reaffirm with her it's not her fault our taste buds don't agree with Sammy's.  First of all, I really wish she would've offered to substitute another dish since she obviously knew we didn't like our food.  Then, we get our check.  Everything is accounted for, including the wine and two sodas that were ordered.  WTF!  She couldn't even omit the sodas!  Luckily, our bill was small, around $40, all said and done $48 down the tubes.  I should've been a stickler and asked for some sort of compensation but, I just can't be \"THAT\" person."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered wasn't good. The only reason why I am giving 1 star because the service was ok. The pizza tasted worse than frozen pizza and their wrap was also terrible. I told the waitress that about the food and she didn't take anything off of our check. DONT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"This place used to be good but the meal and experience we just had was awful. The pizza sauce tasted like dishwater, the pizzas barely had any toppings and were soaked with grease, the service was slow (only one glass of water the whole meal, no check back to see how the meal was and we had to ask for the bill, and table next to us had dirty dishes on it for most of our time there). The only positive is that the server recognized that we weren't happy and sent over the manager who took care of most of the bill and we were given water cups to go."}
{"text":"They accidentally put cow cheese on my pizza (which I am allergic to), but then they felt so bad they comped out whole meal for a party of 9. Super hospitable and accommodating! Thank you Sammie's crew."}
{"text":"I wanted to give em 3 stars, but couldn't, the quality is great , service superb, and prices right on spot.  I think I wanted to go less, due to previous experiences with the Sahara location, but this location rocks and I would go again.   Solid lunch stuff. salads and burgers off the hook!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza!  Great gluten free crust.  Will come back for sure!! Megan our sever was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and the food never disappoints. Servers are attentive and the atmosphere is modern and clean. The appetizers are fun and savory. I love the grits entree and hubby loves the pizza. Nice, spacious booth seating too...great spot for friends/fam who want to gather around and visit."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar attached to the restaurant...which by the way serves the full Sammy's menu 24/7.  Kevin B. and I stopped in here last week for some chow after work at about 8.  The place had quite a few patrons inside...many of which seemed to be regulars.  Despite the fact that the sole bartender was running both the bar and lounge area we received really great service.  He greeted us immediately upon sitting down and provided great service throughout the meal.  Our beers were comp'd for play and the pizza was quite good; we had the New York Style with mushrooms, pepperoni, salami, and italian sausage.  The pizza size is plenty to share if you have a salad or an app.  There's also a touch-tunes machine in the bar that you can use to play your own music for 50c per song."}
{"text":"Such good food! I love that they have options that will appeal to all my friends with food requirements: Vegen, Gluton Free. The staff is always friendly and it's never a long wait (if any) for lunch service. My favorite is the chilled veggie salad with chicken, whatever they do to those artichokes is incredible!! Prices are a bit high for an everyday lunch spot but for the once and a while treat, this is definitely the place!

They also have a pretty good happy hour, which always makes me happy! :)"}
{"text":"The lounge is 24hrs! Great place to stop by and have a yummy bite to eat at all hours of the night!! Been coming here for years, never disappoints :)"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here!!!
I have been several times and always a good choice. The Sahara location has an fantastic out door patio, when it is not to hot or cold here in LV.

I have tried a few \"entrees\" from the regular menu, and honesty did not love them.
They were totally fine, but nothing that memorable.

My advice for Sammy's - Stick to pizza and salad! It is what they do best!
And you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. I appreciate the variety but love my fav! Always pleasant service. You can even come with friends who need to be gluten-free and enjoy a pizza together. A good choice for group meals :-)"}
{"text":"If there's one thing I have learned since moving here to Vegas a couple of months ago is that the restaurant's here are truly 'high on themselves' as if their menu items are the next best thing...  

I base my opinion's on certain factors - Customer Service, Food, Pricing and Atmosphere in that order; I know not all establishments meet all 4 consistently, so I can be satisfied with food and pricing.  

My family and I were out shopping one evening and since it was dinner time, we all decided that Pizza would be our choice for the meal.  Since we had seen the sign for Sammy's a few times, we decided to give it a go...  

Atmoshpere was great and the Customer Service was ok... cannot say much about the Pizza as I just couldn't bring myself to paying $12 for a personal sized pizza.. My impression is that they are trying to cover the cost of the decor by charging rediculous prices for dough, sauce and toppings... 

This is just one man's opinion, but I will never return to this establishment based on atmosphere alone.."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! I normally don't care for pizza but that was before I ate a slice of their garlic chicken pizza!! 

The price for it isn't too bad and it's a decent size for one person, you'll definitely have leftovers! 

I haven't tried the salads or other entrees yet, but from what I saw on others' plates, I can tell the other food is great! I mean, it must taste as good as it looks right?? (:"}
{"text":"I've always had great service and I find the menu really interesting. I love that they have a good amount of gluten free options as well. Not gonna lie though, pretty disappointed in their GF pizza. It tasted like frozen dough and wasn't crispy nor fluffy. It was just soft and disappointing :( But I've throughly enjoyed everything else I've ever tried there."}
{"text":"Top notch service and food.  We went in and we were disappointed that they had changed their appetizers by cutting the portions way back.  We did not even mention it and they gave us a free appetizer because they noticed that we were semi regulars.  Very genuine staff."}
{"text":"Came for a quick bite to eat. Waited about 20 mins for a 12 inch pizza! Service was okay nothing exceptional. Pizza was average at best not very good considering I paid 12.99. Would most likely never eat here again to be honest."}
{"text":"Service a 3 - ok.
Food  a 1.5 - below average. 
The best thing in this place is their passion tea.
Manage your expectations.  Not a good restaurant..but not horrible.
Spicy Chicken Angelhair- No flavor..dry..no sauce..maybe $2 worth of ingredients all for the bargain price of $17.50! Seriously..there were maybe 6 or 7 very small pieces of chicken.
Kobe sliders..you would be happier with a Big Mac.
Fries are drenched in salt.
Hummus was ok.
Done with this place. Too many other options in the area."}
{"text":"The food is always good. I never have any issues with anything that I order.
This particular evening, Lexi, was our server. From the first interaction on she was cold & unhappy. 
We wait 15 minutes at our table before we were ever greeted. She brought our salad before our silverware. Our waters were never refilled by her. I had to stop a different server twice to ask him for refills. When she was sat a second table we were completely ignored, all together. I had to get up to ask for my check. Then a third server helped me, she offered to get the manager for me. I did decline to speak to the manager. (Even though she had only checked on us once.) It was late & I needed to get the family home. However she insisted, so I spoked to him. The whole time it was blatantly obvious that Lexi was trying to hear everything I was saying. 
I don't plan on returning to that location, anytime soon. However, if I do I will definitely be making sure I get a different server."}
{"text":"I would have rated 5 stars, but based on our service I can only give 4.  The pizza we had was delicious. The service was slow which was surprising because they hardly had anyone eating there at the time.  We actually almost missed our flight because it took so long for our card to be processed."}
{"text":"Went in for a nice place to eat and relax before our flight. My husband and I waited for over 10 minutes without ever seeing our waitress. 

Finally caught someone to ask who our waitress was. Her response?  \"I'm your waitress. I'll be with you in a few minutes.  I've got a couple of tables over there.\"  

Seriously?  It would have been different if she'd recognized our wait, maybe pretended to care.  We would have waited. 

Needless to say, we left and went across the way to Burger King. Not quite the atmosphere we were after, but at least they were nice to us there."}
{"text":"They have a patio out front to enjoy the weather or you can sit at the bar or a booth or a table.
The servers are friendly and enthusiastic. They have a nice wine list and happy hour daily from 3- 6 pm. 
The decor is dark yet calming. Pizza is their specialty but there are other appetizers and main dishes to chose from also. I have yet to try their desserts but from the ones that were on other tables, they look very scrumptious.
I gave Sammy's a 5 for their vegetarian/vegan options."}
{"text":"My first time to eat at this restaurant at the LAS airport. We ordered a pineapple pizza, ice tea & a bowl of tomato soup. The tab came up to $28. I know airport restaurants are usually pricey & I don't mind paying the price. But the food is just so-so. The pizza is flavor-less. The pineapple on the pizza is not chunks but wafer thin pineapple slices stuck on the pizza. I couldn't taste any pineapple flavor. The tomato soup was the same; no tomato flavor & only spicy. I don't have high expectation on airport restaurant food but this restaurant is really the worst. I will never come back & I will tell all my friends not to eat here."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of woodfired pizza and this place did not upset.

I started off with the Mac and Cheese, which was amazing!!! And followed it up with the BBQ chicken pizza.

I worked for a pizza place for years and made many unique pizzas up one of them was a bbq chicken pizza, the one at sammy's was even better than I could make at home, my only complaint would be the pizzas are a little small, but the quality more than makes up for it.

I need to get back to Sammy's again, there is a Messy Sundae with my name on it!!!"}
{"text":"Biggest ripoff! Cocktails so weak nobody can detect alcohol, then it's $16.   Food is weak and overpriced.  Never felt so cheated at an airport dining experience."}
{"text":"Don't even bother! The women who work here are miserable and they are not afraid to show it! Union dollars at its best! Horrible service!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the duck! The sundae that overflows like lava! And most of all the pizza...but again I hate the pricing!!!"}
{"text":"My day was just entirely turned around after stopping by Sammy's for lunch. The service was outstanding, and our waitress Marnie was one in a million. Drinks topped off at all times, prompt service, always asking if we needed anything, etc. Her charismatic smile and exceptional service truly made my food even more satisfying. Thanks Marnie!"}
{"text":"I actually don't come here for pizza, but for their tapas menu. While a tad on the pricey side (average cost is $10-13 per dish for tapas) they do have an interesting variety of appetizers to choose from.

Recommended: Labne (sour cream-like yogurt dip, served with flatbread) and duck tacos. Not really a fan of the hummus here, too oily and actually quite bitter.

Service could be better too, considering how uncrowded it actually is!"}
{"text":"Didn't eat here so not a food reviews. Everyone here seems unorganized and not interested in serving guests. Had to catch a flight, didn't want to find out if they could get their act together long enough to serve me a quick bite. Newsflash: customers at the airport usually have time constraints"}
{"text":"Not good. No flavor. Service was friendly, but not fast in an almost empty dining room. Blah."}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined at this location several times before, but we stopped going for a period of time for a wide variety of reasons. We decided to give Sammy's a try a few months ago and it was the best decision that we ever made about going back to a restaurant.

We only go to Sammy's when we know Casey is working the floor. He is the best server that we have had at any restaurant that we go to. He knows what we want to drink and how we like them even without saying anything. He always makes sure that everything is up to our standards. He remembers things about us that we talk about and always asks us how our animals are and etc. He was the main reason that we were coming to the restaurant at least once a week for 2 months. 

The food has improved since we started going back to The menu has a lot of unique options. Everything is fresh and very tasty and freshly prepared. You can tell that the staff really cares about what they are cooking. 

Here are some of the items that we recommend trying. 

Duck Tacos - Nice Portion, Full of Flavor
Cheese Bread - Nice and Cheesey
Chicken Satay - Sauce is to DIE for

Salads

Shrimp Casear Salad - Fresh & Full of Flavor
Greek Salad - Huge Portion & Full of Flavor

Entrees

Shrimp & Grits - Seasoned perfectly and some of the best grits around
Pasta Bolognese - Sauce is spot on. Better than what I can make

Dessert

Salted Carmel Pudding - Sweet, Rich and Hits the Spot."}
{"text":"I've been here probably 30 times since they opened. Overall this is a great place and fairly consistent.  The pizzas are very good and the salads kick much salad ass! Beer and wine only with decent happy hour that goes until 6 PM.

Service is generally good, have had a few times where service was spotty, but overall good.  There menu changed (I think all Sammy's did) and very happy they have the \"old menu\" back. Will be back. My kids love it too.  Sign up for their email list, they send good specials."}
{"text":"I've been to at least 7 Sammy's locations and always think their service is great, except for this one. Came in for dinner with my wife at 7 pm on a Saturday. Got seated promptly and then waited for over 10 mins before we bounced. Place had 8 tables of customers and was over half empty. As we are walking out the manager comes over and asked if she could help us. If it was busy I would have understood.  

She could have helped tell the four severs who were carrying on in the kitchen they had customers except she was one of the ones carrying on. Won't be back to this Sammy's."}
{"text":"Great service. The food was awesome we order a royal Hawaiian pizza, cheese bread (looks like and is the same size as their pizzas), roasted chicken w/pesto dish. All the food had great flavors, the only thing I would change was the ventilation of the restaurant the fire wood scent was very strong, other than that I'd say it was overall a great place."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to get some food while waiting for your flight.  The restaurant is located in Terminal 1, D Gates.  We had the New York Style pizza and it was delicious. The pizza had decent flavors and the buttery crisp crust was perfect.  The downside was paying $10 for a domestic draft beer. Service was good with decent turnaround from the time food was ordered and presented at the table."}
{"text":"great pizza great duck tacos, wish they were open later"}
{"text":"Customer service along with great food are primary in any restaurant. In my first time experience with Sammy's at this location, I can give it 4 Stars.

The man who took my order ( should have gotten his name) was naturally friendly and made sure that the timing of my to go order would work for me. That's a first in my take out history. 

The food was on time and the pizza was in box that is better than most I've seen. It kept it nice and hot until I got home. 

I'll go back again soon, to be sure. I won't keep eating pizza's but I'll try other things including a sit down. If it falters I'll amend this or write another review."}
{"text":"Every time I have ate here food has been delicious I usually get the tomato soup and the chicken skewers with truffle fries have to be the best fries I have tasted so far!!!"}
{"text":"Very good gluten-options. Sammy's is a classy pizza joint with affordable prices. Join their email club and get free stuff. They usually feature coupons in the Entertainment Book."}
{"text":"I just had a real good BBQ Chicken Pizza here at Sammy's. I like the service as well as they bring you a craft of whatever you are drinking so you do not have to wait for a server to refill your glass. 

I would recommend this as a nice date place. 

-Matthew Yarbrough-"}
{"text":"The happy hour specials are great.  They make the prices just about right.  I absolutely love the baba ganoush...the flatbread they serve it with is very good.  The atmosphere at this location is great.  It's almost always busy, but not too busy.  We always get seated right away and have great service."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot. Only giving  it 4 stars because they were understaffed in the front of house so service was very slow at times. Wasn't a lack of effort though. Our server was very sweet and efficient but she was just super busy and oversat because there was only 2 of them and the dining room was full. Thankfully the Kitchen was staffed so food came out quickly and was oh so good. We got the mini duck tacos, chicken lettuce cups and the Sicilian pizza. Yum yum and yum! Great presentations. Saved just enough room for dessert so we had to try the Messy Sundae and we were so glad we did. That thing is awesome and it had a very unique presentation. And, because our server knew her service was slow at times, she was a sweetheart and had it comped off. Wish I remembered her name because she deserves some props. This place is worth a stop. I'm looking forward to our next visit because there are a lot of other small plates I need to try. PS - try to get there before 6pm on weekdays...1/2 price small plates for happy hour. Next time!!"}
{"text":"The pizza and salad were very tasty.  I am most happy that the staff was super helpful and knowledgeable about food allergies.   They really went out of their way to be sure for me and therefore my whole family was able to enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"Parking on Saturday night around 7 pm was fair but not great.  Fast seating with no wait.
We got appetizers of edimame and pork fried dumplings.
Then for main dishes was Thai chicken pizza, garlic shrimp pizza and shrimp angel hair pasta. All dishes looked great and tasted great.
Service was ON tonight. So you're good to go."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The service was pretty good throughout lunch. But it's what happened after I paid and Ieft that ticks me off. I signed their receipt and I crumpled the customer receipt and left. As I was walking to the car the server we had came out and told me I didn't sign a receipt when I absolutely did. So I followed her back in to my now cleaned off table and did not find the receipt. She handed me my crumpled customer receipt and told me I could sign that bc \"oh it must have disappeared\" trying to make it like I stiffed her. Mind you this was all in front of other customers dining. So I took the receipt and again tipped and signed. So now I have done this twice and been embarrassed. Let's just say this ruined my experience."}
{"text":"I had a craving for pizza. So this is where the review starts...

We decided to go to Sammy's and I was pleasantly suprised at the outside seating area. Unfortunately, I get cold easily so I stayed inside. However, there is a nice little fire going with booths and tables surrounding it. 

I opted for the Tuscan pizza while my bf chose the New York. I secretly liked his better and was jealous that I didn't chose that one. But we share so I did get a piece of the pie. 

I choose Tuscan because of the arugula and prosciutto. I know prosciutto is salty but it didn't seem to fare well on my pizza. Plus, I didn't know that it was fresh arugula on my pizza... It was a suprise. But I ate the pizza with no complaints...

However my friends.... the NEW YORK pizza was delicious.  MEAT! MEAT! MEAT! Could have had more salami but I guess all good things in moderation. 

Would I go here again? Possibly. But I think I'll try out other pizza joints in the area first."}
{"text":"I don't understand the low stars because I loved it here. My friend was hungry and this was one of the only kitchens open at the 11:45pm hour. We shared the New York pizza. Omg it was surprisingly delicious. The crust was good and crispy. Delicious pizza sauce and lots of toppings. The lovely lady that served us was really nice. I had no issues here."}
{"text":"First visit to Sammy's.  Greeted right away and sat at a booth.  Only a handful of diners as restaurant was 50 minutes till closing time.
Server came right over and took drink and app order.  Asian sampler app arrived after pizzas had been dropped off, he said the sampler took a little longer to cook.  Sampler was a little miserable for the $14 cost and was just ok.
Pizza was yummy both the royal Hawaiian and the New York one, thin base, not too crispy, so nice limp slices and a crunchy crust.  Good size pizzas, will share one next time."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Try the barbecue pizza, yes lawd; definitely hit the spot! Our server was attentive, funny, and on point. Will definitely revisit. Oh, don't sleep on the shrimp pizza. Their menu is diverse, and the one off of Durango is worth the visit."}
{"text":"i went here for lunch today with my boyfriend. the service was good, and worthy of a good tip. the food on the other hand was not what i had expected. strange, because we've gone here in the past and really enjoyed our experience.

we ordered duck tacos and lettuce wraps to start. to drink i ordered a hefeweizen and my boyfriend ordered the tenaya creek local draft which we both enjoyed. everything about the duck tacos was amazing except the duck. it was dry and mostly tasteless. the lettuce wraps were alright, like every other lettuce wrap i've had but a little on the salty side. then we ordered a tuscan pizza and a sicilian pizza to share. both were good, but i thought the tuscan was wayyyy too salty. i'm almost positive it was the olives. for dessert we ordered the fudgy sundae.... it came to us in a wine glass on a plate sans the fudge. instead, it was a nasty corn syrupy chocolate sauce (the kind you squirt out of a bottle) that poured over the side of the glass and covered the plate, which was really unappetizing to me. the brownie in it wasn't actually a brownie but these cookie-like pieces. not at all what i had anticipated for $8.50.

all in all i felt that for the 60 bucks we paid, the food was sub par. i'm sure we'll go back again, but we'll definitely be trying something that hopefully contains a little less sodium. i think i give up on the desserts from here, they only have 5 things to choose from anyway."}
{"text":"Our Las Vegas friend suggested duck tacos after hanging out and having some drinks for a late night/ early morning (around 4am) snack.  All we needed to hear was tacos and we were in.  The small bar area of this place is open 24/7 so we stopped in for some half priced tapas (happy hour from midnight to 8am) and to chat with Dave, our friend's friend and an incredibly cool guy that was working the overnight shift.  It was 4am and I didn't want to be stuffed before going to bed, so I only ordered a few dishes.  I had the steak skewers with teriyaki glaze and the garlic cheese bread.  Both were good, but the garlic cheese bread was really good in its garlicy and cheesy-ness.  I also had one of the duck tacos from one of the others' plates and it was decent, but if I got it again I'd get it without the creamy tomato cilantro sauce.  Overall, I'd say the food is worth 3 or 3.5 stars, but Dave's coolness bumps this location up to a solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite chain restaurant and I rarely get the pizzas. I'm totally in love with their fish taco entree, the mini duck taco appetizer, lobster mac and cheese and the greek salad. I love coming here in the evenings and finding a seat outside by the fire pit. The inside dining room is nice too and rather lounge-y versus diner-y. Happy hour is great here for the 1/2 price apps and drink specials. And one in awhile I'll find a buy one get one coupon in an Entertainment guide and I'll rush down to this restaurant to use it."}
{"text":"Sammy's is probably my favorite chain restaurant. The food is consistently good and the menu offers many healthy options that sound and taste delicious. My favorites are the Duck Tacos appetizer and the Baja tacos entree.

Did you know they have cotton candy?? I didn't until recently. The serving looks huge but it's just all fluffy sugar so you can eat it all! Well... I can ... gulp. It's a fun alternative to their messy sundae.

Wait staff is always attentive.  I've been here many times for happy hour and they'll warn me when the time is getting close when the happy hour ends so I can get in another drink or app on the discount."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza to go , not impressed . I paid extra for pineapple .. there was none on it . The Caesars salad would have been 21.00$ if i wanted chicken on it .. the small pizza was bland and won't go back ."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Our server was very  knowledgable about the menu items and helpful with our decisions. The wait was a bit long, but that's unavoidable sometimes. We were happy to wait and glad we did. The hummus appetizer is delicious. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"food and staff are excellent!  we always have either Liz or Karissa serve us they are very attentive  and knowledgeable! Great gluten  free menu! definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot but that was about a year ago. I don't know what happened..the food was just o.k this time. Bread was a little stale and salad wasn't that great. The time it took for people to get their food was about 20 minutes too long. Just sitting and waiting. The table next to us was dirty for about 30 minutes. More employees would help so we have a quality experience."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with the fam (first time in ages), and the restaurant was empty. 
This place is very nostalgic to me, because it was my first \"gourmet\" pizza experience as a child, and tonight I was reminded of why I used to love this place. 

My family and I shared a Chinese chicken salad, the bbq chicken pizza, garlic chicken pizza, garlic shrimp pizza, the New York style, and the Thai chicken pizza. Talk about pizza galore. The ingredients on the pizzas were all very fresh, and the dough was so soft. The cheese was also really thick and chewy which I am fond of. My favorites were the garlic chicken and shrimp and the bbq chicken pizza. I forgot how large the pizzas actually were so we ended up taking half of the pizzas home. IMO, this place is still better than CPK (CPK is overrated and overpriced).

Server was nice and accommodating. 
Will definitely be back if we're in the mood for wood fired pizza."}
{"text":"Went to Sammy's wth friends that came to visit from out of town. We wanted to go to a quality restuarant without the prices The Strip has to offer. We landed at Sammy's Woodfire Pizza. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, we were catered to perfectly by the staff. Service, to me, is just as important as the food. I had the angle hair pasta and my friends shared a pizza. I tasted all that was present at our table. Everything was tastey and our served, Sean (?), was amazing. He filled our glasses when needed, he talked with us for a small time to get to know us and he made sure anything we needed was provided. I most certainly will be returning."}
{"text":"My first time coming here yesterday.  Me and the sister spent 2 hours at Chuckie Cheese and wanted pizza but not the chuckie cheese pizza..or whatever it is they serve over there, haha. We were promptly seated, our waitress was very nice and saved us some money when we were contemplating ordering by telling us how large the portions are and that we could split the pizza and salad between the 4 of us (me, sister 2 kids)

We started out with a bread basket. It had some sourdough and some crispy cracker like wafers which had a spicy kick to them, yummy!!!   Muy Bueno!

We decided to keep it simple for the kids and get the pepperoni and the chopped chicken salad (sub. ranch dressing over the red wine vinaigrette)   the pizza was great, very crispy crust and the tomato sauce was yummyyyyyy. The pepperoni's were large and tasted fresh. The salad was honestly the star of the show - i love a salad that is chopped and has enough dressing to cover everything, no dry spots in here!!!!!!!

Earlier while ordering we told the waitress we were trying to save room for some frozen yogurt next door and she was nice enough to bring us out a free \"messy\" sundae. It was HUGE and sooooooooooooo delicious. (I posted a pic)   the kids went cray-cray for it and I can only imagine how bad they were bouncing off the walls when they got home that night from all the sugar...  sorry Sis! hahahahahaha"}
{"text":"Great Mac-and-Cheese for the kid.... Mom and Dad were happy too!"}
{"text":"Good is okay. This store used to be top notch but went downhill a bit years ago during later evening hours. Service is okay. Try Town Square location or Henderson instead."}
{"text":"No WiFi...  Ummmmm...  Great food,  the food is always consistently good,  they have a great staff,  but no WiFi...  Bummer...."}
{"text":"This place is just awesome.   I have moved to Orlando and they are not there, which sucks.  The salads are unreal,  great pizza and all the good is excellent.   A must try!!  The picture is the: Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad, best salad ever...."}
{"text":"Amazing food, tremendous service and great happy hour specials. We've become regulars over the past few months and this is now our family's go to spot."}
{"text":"Wake up late?  Go out after midnight?  Looking for a bite to eat before heading to the strip to gamble?  Sammy's will scratch that itch.

My bro and I ended up in here to grab a pizza.  We sat at the bar and ate pizza, had a few beers, and the moved on to the strip afterward.  Since my memories were all blending together on the trip (prior to my Thanksgiving trip), I don't recall exactly what I ate other than it was cheesy, round, and didn't end up on the ground.  I'll have to come back again since I drive by it all the time when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great place to come for lunch with friends. The salads are large enough for two people and they don't mind splitting them if you ask. Get the tropical unsweetened iced tea instead of the regular!!

PROS:
Tropical Iced Tea
Greek Salad
Baba Ganoush
Parmesan Crusted Artichokes
Hummus
Fig, caramelized onions & gorgonzola flatbread (Amazing!)
Strawberry & watermelon salad
Prosciutto & artichoke pizza

CONS:
Chicken Lettuce Cups - to much sauce and too much of a smokey flavor for my taste.
Tapas - priced on the high side."}
{"text":"The bf and I come here for late night eats! We always order the shrimp and crab dip, chicken tequila fettucine and pizza! Fav pizza is the garlic chicken. Never disappointed =)"}
{"text":"Came to grab a bite to eat with some friends and boy was  I surprised! First of all the restaurant closes and the side tavern stays open serving the same delicious food from the restaurant! So, we arrived  (there's plenty of parking by the way) and noticed the restaurant was closed, but someone came out of the tavern and said the tavern side is still open, so don't be discouraged! 
We walked in, and was attended immediately by a very friendly waitress. We asked for suggestions and the told us the most popular items, so we took her suggestion and had the \"Mini Duck Tacos\" & \"Mediterranean Dip Sampler\" for starters. The tacos were amazing, so beware! You will probably be making more than one order! Afterwards we ordered a New York Style Pizza! It was surprisingly tasty and very delicious but then again all pizza is tasty and delicious lol... Reasonable prices for great food and a variety of food at that! Inside the tavern you can also sit at the bar and play video poker if you wish, I was more into the sit down table. Restrooms are clean and maintained. Overall, Sammy's Woodfired pizza and grill was a hit!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day with a friend.  They offer some nice lunch specials so we each had own our personal pan pizza.  The pizza was not horrible, but i was just underwhelmed, mainly because the reviews were so stellar.  It was a solid pie, don't get me wrong, but i think it was better suited as a shared appetizer rather than my main meal.

The reviews mainly mentioned the pizza so I am not aware of the authenticity or the quality of many other offerings at Sammy's, but I will need to come back and try another meal.  This restaurant is very close to me house so I really hope I can find something to my liking next time I happen to stop in.  I think lunch is ideal for Sammy's because there menu does have some nice value during that time of the day."}
{"text":"I went here the other day hungry and that was part of the problem. I didn't realize the Sammie's was attempting to be more of a mid upscale, bougie restaurant.
I ordered an asian sampler appetizer for 3 of us that was near $15 and it came with 2 wontons, 4 small pieces of shrimp and 2 little pieces of chicken on skewers. It wasn't terrible but I definitely expected more for the price. It reminded me of the little plates you would find at an upscale restaurant.

We then ordered a Hawaiian pizza and were really disappointed as well. It wasn't terrible but it was not what we were expecting for a pizza joint. It came with circular slabs of ham cut in half and sporadically placed on the pizza. The pineapples were whole slices placed on the pizza totally covering the cheese that was thinly placed on it. The pizza itself was very thin and didn't really hit the spot. 

Other than the food the waitress was nice and efficient."}
{"text":"I love their salads the best in Las Vegas! All their food is good but, the salads yummy! 

The restaurant part is great. Food is consistently good.... service is good. 

The bar service is pretty bad. I went with a friend a half dozen times and the service is belowwww average and sometimes the food is good and sometimes it isn't. The bartender said there's a good cook on graveyard and there's one that's bad?!? I can't keep up with the good cooks schedule late night so, I'll just have to eat their during normal business  hours. Too bad it would be a great place to continue to go to after work but, the service or lack there of is too annoying. 

I love their salads ( when the good cooks r there lol) so I'm still giving them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Sammy's never fails to be amazing. I tried the Sicilian pizza today and it was great. I usually have the artichoke, but it was an excellent choice. We love having dinner or lunch here. I have never had a bad meal here and the menu has something for everyone and also has vegan options."}
{"text":"Sammy's is great! I have eaten here many many times. They have an awesome appetizer list and offer happy hour every day of the week. All of their items are fresh and unique. Their menu notes that they support local farms which is a nice additive. 

We went for dinner. There were three of us. We started with a chopped chicken salad, which we modified slightly. Added pepperoni and put the dressing on the side. You have the option for kalamata olives with this salad or sundried tomatoes. We chose the olives because there is already fresh tomato in it. It was very good. The chicken in it is charred on the grill fresh to order. So be prepared everyone, the chicken on their salads is......wait.....warm! It doesn't bother me at all but I know some people might not like that. We shared the salad and it was great and piled high! Plenty for three people. 

We shared two pizzas. One NY Style and one Hawaiian. The NY Style has sauteed mushrooms on it, finely ground beef, sausage, and pepperoni. But, they don't overwhelm their pizza with meat. The Hawaiian was excellent too. Mainly because they thin slice the pineapple. It's such a small detail but it was nice to not have chunks of pineapple weighing down the pizza. 

Overall, great experience. Service was on point. We all drank water and no dessert for us. Bill was, $43. Not bad for a sit down dinner for three. We will of course be back."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this pizza! Its sooooooooo amazing! And they make it fresh! If you are waiting at the airport, please stop in here where they have a woodburing oven and a great little bar! You can have an ice cold draft as you wait or have a sit down in their dinning area! They also have a little station off to the side where you can grab cold beverages and beer and wine!"}
{"text":"If i could give 0 stars i would.  I just left here with some coworkers and not one of us was happy with our pizza.  3 of us purchased the thai chicken pizza.  The pizza had so much cilantro you could barely taste anything else.  

To top everything off , when i bit into my second slice of pizza the chicken still had a decent sized bone , STILL IN IT.   To give them credit , they did comp my pizza and did keep the ice tea flowing , but honestly i will never visit this location again.  

Ive had way better \"upscale\" pizza at CPK ( California Pizza Kitchen)

Ambiance 4\5
Server 3\5
Food 0\5
Cost 0\5.

Ive chewed 2 pieces of gum and still taste cilantro & 
free choking hazard with every purchase act now !"}
{"text":"So full of flavor! Everyone is so nice and friendly from the moment you walk in.  You get a lot of food for the price and everything was served promptly and just how we ordered it. We love going to Sammy's!"}
{"text":"Whenever we drive by, the kids say \"There's Woodpecker Pizza\" which always gets a laugh out of me. The food is good. Big selection, not just pizza. The fancy pizzas reminds me of a pizza place I used to eat at when I was younger, so I like going in there. They have a big outdoor section which is really nice at this time of year April. Salads, soups, international food like Chinese and Mexican. Servers are nice, TVs. A little expensive, but I will keep it in the restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"I love their lunch menu! No wonder they are packed every day.
 Great hummus with pita bread. Juicy sliders. Big yummy salads. The brussel sprouts are delicious.
 Try everything because the prices are low!
 The service and staff are fantastic!"}
{"text":"The service is very good. I was there on Friday night and Kevin really took care of me.  The food was delicious  and tasted real fresh.  My order was goofed up twice, and Kevin let me keep the wrong pizza and take it home. Of course, I was not charged for their error.  The atmosphere is lively but the tables are a little too close to one another which is I'm sure a corporate concept and not this individual restaurant.

This restaurant always runs a happy hour but you cannot use the Entertainment coupon with happy hour specials which is understandable.

I will definitely return to Sammy's in the near future."}
{"text":"Sammys is on the ball again! Did my 30th birthday here, Erin took care of me again last minute and arranged a reservation for me and my friends. The food servers were attentive and prompt, the food was incredible. I had the chicken lettuce cups and babaganoush. So scrumptious. The messy birthday sundae looked amazing, I couldn't really eat it cause of my diet but my friends loved it! I couldn't have asked for a better birthday thank you so much Erin and the sammys staff!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for just a desert.  The messy Sunday is an amazing treat and the front outdoor porch was a great place to enjoy it in front of the fire pit.  I would have given it five stars if it had more ice cream in the cup and less whip cream."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here at the restaurant as a type this. Greeting was good, waiter helped me out as soon as I got seated. The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way was that he started telling me about the prices of the food. Other than that he was cool. I ordered the mahi tacos. Pretty good, they could have held the dry lettuce. This lettuce was mad dry and old. Just take glimpse of the photo."}
{"text":"Love this place,  great food and the best thing of all they are 24hrs!!! 

A bit higher on price than expected."}
{"text":"Erica! Thank you for the wonderful service. You were very attentive, and extremely kind. You greatly contributed to the wonderful atmosphere at Sammy's. & of course the food was delish as always. Get the Caesar salad!"}
{"text":"The wait is terrible!!!  We waited for 1/2 hr for a salad and tacos.. Salad came with dressing we asked for no dressing.  Then over 15 minutes we waited and left"}
{"text":"Had a house salad, prosciutto pizza, glass of Malbec.  Delightful way to end a busy week.  The house salad was one of the better house salads I've ever had - very well-dressed and I loved the kalamata olives.  Good stuff, i would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! The staff are wonderful people you'll fall in love with them, the food is oh my god amazing! Pizza tastes so good you can easily eat a whole pie for yourself, it's really really good. But make sure you save room for desert Fire pit outside is super cool! Make sure to join the Sammy's Social Club because you get to try great drinks paired delicious food :))"}
{"text":"Told a 10 minute wait for table. Then when we were about to be seated told it would be a 45 min wait for food.  Seriously? The place was not even full. Also, the hostess was extremely rude."}
{"text":"We eat here often! Every time I come I always order the chilled veggie salad! It's delish! Love the salmon and chicken plate. The mac n cheese is pretty tasty too! The desserts are awesome!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here on Mothers day after discovering they had Gluten Free options from the Find Me GF App. It was slow and not busy at all (at first), which I was worried could be because of the food (it picked up mid service) They have Vegetarian, Vegan, GF options on menu which has identifying labels. I wanted pizza and was happy they offered GF crust and Vegan cheese. The waitress was very helpful in making sure I was making choices to fit my allergies. Once the order was placed the manager came over to let me know they already had some \"specialty\" pizzas in the oven and my food would come out before the rest of the tables as to not cross contaminate with the gluten food. I was so pleased that they were tentative to my allergies and did all they could to handle my food with care. 

The food was delicious and didn't taste any less than what a normal pizza tastes like. I had a fresh salad and had them hold the mozzarella. The dressing was balsamic so no worries in the GF department. 

The rest of the table (who has no allergies) had normal items from the menu and raved about how good they were. The 5 cheese pizza was a hit and so was the BBQ Pizza. Everyone was very pleased with the service and the quality of food. 

For my Vegan/GF/Vegetarian friends- you will be pleased with the menu options and the taste behind them all. After eating here I did not experience any reactions so it is safe. As always please let them know so they will handle your food with care. 

This is yet another choice for my \"complicated\" allergy that allows me to feel normal and I appreciate that."}
{"text":"We were in the area, very hungry and  both pretty excited there was a Sammy's  close by. I don't have many choices because of my gluten intolerance but Sammy's has GF options.  My husband and I ordered the exact same pizza's as we did at the N Durango location and they didn't taste anything like the ones we had there. 

They both were under cooked, the ingredients didn't taste fresh at all. It just didn't taste like it held the same standards as that location. I've only eaten at the N Durango location and that set the bar pretty high and this didn't even come close. 

It wasn't even worth asking them to remake it, or put it back in the oven, because I don't believe they could have done any better than what they served us. Needless to say I walked out hungry and slightly grumpy that I wasted my money. 

It has a casino/bar and restaurant you can sit and order at and I normally don't like to sit in the \"smoking\" section but the hubby wanted to gamble and we were the only ones in there so I that's where we ate. Bartenders were nice and very personable.I ordered the cucumber cooler (i think)  and it was about as delicious as the food.

I've raved about the Durango & 95 location. Now I know that each location could be different from the next, so keep that in mind.

I would just be leery of this Sammy's. It's close to the strip and has that casino bar feel and It really does lack quality, but don't use this location to judge the rest."}
{"text":"nice pleace to eat pizza or something before you get in to the flight. im doing this all the times ... if you stop there ask for Cassandra she is very nice and sweet server , she treat us very special. she is very energetic and happy women. im sad because i have to leave but she make me happy"}
{"text":"Service is always fast and friendly!!! The five cheese pizza is AMAZING!!! Do not hesitate to come here!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great and the service is excellent at this location. Every time we go here, I'm impressed by their friendliness and attentiveness. Better than the service you get at most restaurants on the Strip for a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"Had a stop here in the Las Vegas airport on my way home fro ma work conference.  This was not a typical airport restaurant.  First of, they make everything to fresh to order.  So make sure you have a good amount of time to sit and relax while your food is being made fresh for you.  

I was with a co-worker and we ordered a plain Margarita pizza and split it.  It was a good pizza, although they were out of basil.  The crust was nice a crispy and there was plenty of cheese on the pizza.  I would have liked to have had more sauce on the pizza though.  

The service was fast and friendly and the food did come out in a timely manner, especially for being made to order.  I would definitely recommend this place if you've got an hour to kill in the D terminal."}
{"text":"Always good service and fresh food. Great place to get in and out fast! I would recommend the humans. Vet rich and satisfying. Definitely a great lunch spot on the go!"}
{"text":"OMG - Freak'n Awesome Food !!!!
Pizzas and more !!!!
Sooooo Good !!!!
We had the wood fired pizzas and the Wagu cheeseburger-
For appetizers try the grilled Brussel Sprouts and the Thai Chicken Sate - Amazing !!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times since it opened up a couple years ago. When we want to eat out and can't decide where to go we usually end up coming here since it has decent food, a diverse menu and is kid-friendly. Here's a rundown of some of the things I've tried:

- Mini duck tacos: good
- Hummus: good, but nothing special
- Thin crust pizzas: I love the Dorthea Sundried tomato pizza, it's probably one of my favorite items; Brie cheese pizza is also very good. Pass on the kobe beef pizza... blah
- Woodfired pizzas: most are solid choices, but not spectacular. The ones I would get again are the Hawaiian, the Thai chicken, garlic chicken, BBQ chicken, or goat cheese.
- Fettuccine alfredo: ehh... pass
- kobe beef burger: not worth it, if you want a burger go someplace else
- grilled shrimp salad: tastes great, the larger order is big enough for 2 people
- risotto: no longer on the menu, which is a good thing because I didn't like it

So, if you come here get a pizza or a salad. Those are your best bets. If you have kids they'll probably find something on the menu that they'll like. The service is usually good, although during peak dining hours expect a wait to get your food."}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place. I wasn't impressed.  I have for sure had better. 
For the price it just wasn't that special. I thought my pizza was a bit too greasy. I know the pizza is wood fired but when the whole bottom is black there is a problem. The outer crust looked perfect the the bottom was just not the same. I had just 1 beverage the whole time and never got a refill. I felt the server was too overwhelmed to pay attention to our table. I brought it to the managers attention who simply replied back with \"we get busy and it just happens\". When it comes to pizza this place doesn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque and lettuce wraps are amazing.  Especially love the happy hour appetizers."}
{"text":"Happy hr 3-6 daily half priced tapas & $$ off on wine & beer"}
{"text":"Went back after at least a year of not eating there due to bad exprriences and it was very good. Had the BBQ pizza.  Only thing we wish they offered is half salads...as its a lotbif you want salad with pizza or other entree and they have no house salad.  :)"}
{"text":"Sammy's Woodfired Pizza is located on W. Sahara and  was the first Las Vegas location to open in 1995. I made a reservations for 10 people for dinner. It was suggested by a friend. They have an outside seating as well and a full bar with happy hour specials. 6500 Tavern gaming room is next door.

They have small plates like Tapas, soups, salad, tacos and ofcourse pizza. I had the Thai pizza and tried the Thai satay. Thai  Shrimp woodfire pizza- I liked the combination of ingredients: julienned vegetables, scallions, cilantro, peanuts, lime juice, fresh mint, and spicy Thai peanut sauce. The pizza was ok, no complain.

I did prefer the Thai Chicken Satays more like my style. It is served with spicy peanut ginger sauce and the chicken was tender.


The service was great. The place was nice and clean. 

You can get a 20% discount if you are LVAC member.

I would love to sit outside near the fire pit. Once I left and after a few hours my head and nose was stuffy due to the smoke cigarette. I am not used to it. This just happens to me at another place if the place is an old establishment, I think the smoke exhaust does not work that well. If I come back, I am def. sitting outside."}
{"text":"I was traveling from Las Vegas back to the DFW area and had some time at lunch to grab a bit before boarding the plane. Our party was seated very quickly.and our waitress took our order very quickly since we were all on a schedule. The other two members in my party orders arrived very quickly, but not my pizza. I waited and waited but no pizza. Our waitress and the manager stopped by our table and apologized. They stated there was a mix-up in the kitchen. The pizza finally arrived and was comp'd from our ticket. The brick-oven pizza was very good, hot and filling."}
{"text":"First time here, great experience!

I loved the menu!  Many options for gluten-free and veg.  They had just rolled out a new Mediterranean menu for the summer that day.  I wanted to try everything!  Nice wine selection with my favorite....Ste Michelle Riesling!  Hard to find here.

We arrived at Happy Hour (3-6).  All Tapas were half off and our wine was $2.00 off a glass.   We ordered the duck tacos and chicken satay.  Our waiter brought out a bread basket and served us sourdough and a flatbread (you have to request the bread we found out).  The sourdough was AMAZING!  I usually skip the bread but wow!  So soft and moist in the middle with a crispy crust.  The flatbread had a great flavor with garlic and caraway seeds. very good.  

Tapas:

Duck Tacos- FABULOUS!  The duck was cooked to perfection, the shell was so crispy and light.  The toppings w/sour cream and goat cheese were perfect with it.  My boyfriend has never tried duck before...now this is his favorite :)
Chicken Satay-  Very good, nice spice and amount of peanuts in sauce.

Meal:

Chinese Chicken Salad- Exactly how it's supposed to be made!  i haven't had one this good in many years.  So many ingredients in it, I can't even list them.  Nice and spicy too.

New York Style Pizza-  high quality pepperoni and salami, the sauce was my favorite.  Great flavor and tasted homemade.  The crust had a great taste but was a bit 'wilted'.  It might have been our toppings.  I will try another next time.

Aside from the great food which we really enjoyed....our waiter Steve was the absolute best !  He genuinely wanted us to have a great experience. He was warm, friendly and attentive.  And because it was our first time...brought us the Messy Sundae for free!  nice touch!

We will be back as much as possible!"}
{"text":"A great spot for a quick delicious lunch! 

I usually come here during my work day to grab lunch with a fellow yelper and we are always happy with the service, food and that we can be in and out in an hour. 

They have great lunch specials for between $9-14 along with a huge menu of anything you can think of!

I love their Chinese chicken salad and the chicken garlic pizza is delicious! The salad is huge and can easily be split between two people. The pizzas at Sammys are coated on the bottom of the crust in cornmeal before throwing it in the wood fired oven so it added and extra crunch. 

I usually order the lunch blackened chicken over a bed a warmed kale with lentils and tomato soup. The chicken is moist and flavorful and the salad has a light lemon dressing without any oil so it's tasty without being fattening. The soup is over two cups worth and isn't the normal small side cup of soup servers with lunches. 

Sammy's is a good place for groups who can't decide what to order and don't want to spend an arm and a leg for it."}
{"text":"The service is good, the quality of thr food is not. I bet the cheesse is our organic pizza was low... my husband and I got our stomach upset. Like when you have something super oily and you want to throw up.."}
{"text":"Close to work so how can I pass this place up. I frequent this place and really like heir food. Went today with a colleague. We split he duck tacos and I had a Caesars salad with grilled shrimp. As always food and service were both stellar! I still have not ordered pizza, just doesn't jump out to me when looking at the menu. Someday...Maybe!"}
{"text":"Wifey was jonezing for one of those sloppy sundaes, so we dropped by Sammy's again. We also split a BBQ Chicken Pizza which was aight.
I noticed the new desserts section and their doughnuts sounded good, so I got those which came with two different sauces. If a restaurant offers doughnuts for dessert, you'll more than likely end up disappointed and are better off at somewhere like Ronald's...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy Duck tacos!!!! They are a must have if you come here. Pizza was eh ok, kind of greasy."}
{"text":"It's not on the Strip, but if you want to have great food and service, without smoke and noise, this is a great spot.
We got a table in the back for a group of 20 upon short notice, two dedicated servers, and a friendly welcome!
The Hummus appetizer is great to share, the menu has a good variety of quality food, and everybody was happy with what they ordered. I can recommend the Hanger Steak over the Steal Frites!"}
{"text":"This is a follow up of my 11/7 review:  i was contacted by the regional manager of sammy's.  She apologized for the lack of management attention & supervision with regards to our situation in which our server minimized us as patrons.  She's invited us to give sammy's another try.  We will, but not @ the west sahara one.  I appreciate the phone validating my review.  Thank yiu."}
{"text":"Jamie is the best bartender in town! Awesome drinks and food... Thank you!!. Get the pear pizza and you will come back for it over and over again!"}
{"text":"Really excited about the refreshed menu.  Hadn't been there in a while, but dropped in for lunch and to my delight discovered some new Vegan salads!  Love the Quinoa and  Avocado salad.  yum!"}
{"text":"To be frank, I don't love pizza & would only go to a pizza place if others choose to eat at a pizza joint. 

Since I typically wouldn't order pizza, I decided to order a salad & got the Thai Spicy Grilled Chicken Salad ($10.50). It was honestly better than I thought! It could've used more dressing, but that's only because I love my salads drenched in dressing. It surprisingly had sufficient amount of peanuts! The individual size could be shared between 2 people. 

Their prices are somewhat typical for dine-in pizza places, and their service was just okay. It's obviously busy during the lunch hour, so the restaurant was 3/4 full. Hence, the service was quite slow. It took our food & bill a while to arrive, and although our server was nice, he rarely checked if we were doing okay."}
{"text":"Sammy's is burying the lead with that woodfired pizza sign. There's so many restaurants around here offering brick oven pizzas that I've kinda put off trying this place for a few months.  

I went in thinking I was gonna get a pizza, but I was wrong. Upon sitting down, I was hit with an extensive menu that overwhelmed me in the best way possible: burgers, tacos, pasta, lettuce wraps, they had pizza too but it seems to only account for like 15% of the menu.

My wife got a pepperoni pizza and it was pretty decent, but the real surprise was how good the burgers are. I dropped my initial plans of having pizza and went with the Kobe beef sliders. Such a good choice! The beef is high quality, well seasoned and cooked, soft bun, aged cheddar, fresh veggies with a flavorful chipotle aoli. They could have stopped there and i'd be impressed, but the fries were awesome as well, golden and crisp with a light season salt.

I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I really like Sammy's. A more accurate score would be 4 1/2 because their is always room for improvement.  But they have some wonderful Mediterranean options. I suggest getting the LEBNI. It is hands down the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I finally decided to try this place after hearing so many good things about it and I was surprisingly shocked at how much I enjoyed the food. 

I went here for lunch with my bf and his mother the other day we also had our newborn with us. So when we get seated the waitress basically tells us that there are no accommodations to set up a baby so we had to put her carrier on the booth seat and have us all on top of each other. After looking over the menu we decided to order the bbq chicken pizza and the meatball pizza both were very delicious and filling I also liked the tropical iced tea mmm mmm good. 

Overall the food was good service was ok, I would have given it 4 stars but i had to take off a star for the fact that they don't accommodate children they don't have the proper seating nor do they have a menu for kids which is important to me seeing that I have 2 kids."}
{"text":"Today I had lunch here with my beautiful girlfriend.  Around lunch hour they are really busy, but the wait was short and we ordered right away and out in about 45mins.  I just had the basic cheeseburger so mine was easy.  My girlfriend comes to Sammy's more often than I do so I would say it is on here favorites list and now it is on mine also.

Thanks"}
{"text":"The food was great! The atmosphere was comfortable. Location is good. Restaurant looked clean. I gave 4 stars because the server didn't give my boyfriend the Veterans discount. Perhaps it was an accident."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast while waiting for my flight. Was seated right away by a very nice lady. They were fairly busy and understaffed. The service was very good regardless. I ordered the Blueberry pancakes with sausage links. I received three large plate sized pancakes with blueberries cooked in the batter and also spread on top. Side was two large sausage links. Butter and syrup on the side. Food was great. I also saw other food coming out that looked great and all portions seemed to be big. In fact I didn't finish all mine. I wood recommend for breakfast at least."}
{"text":"Its not the food that made me not want to eat here ever again, its the service. Twice Ive been here and they f@*k up my order every time.

The first time I went, I asked for the glutton free crust pizza. We basically ate the whole pizza and found out later we got the regular crust. The place was pretty much empty on a week day for lunch, so why was service so slow? We had to ask several times for water and basically didnt get any.
When I asked for a box, he took my plate of leftovers and never returned. A new server came out and I asked her where is my leftovers? She said \"Im sorry they threw it away\"
Because I like the food so much and the alternatives that they offer I decided to give it another try.

We went again for lunch and asked for the pizza with Vegan cheese. A long dark haired woman with fluffy eyelashes was polite and cheery. But her pleasant attitude didnt mean much when, again the cheese was wrong and we ate a whole pizza with the wrong cheese. I was dissatisfied with the salad drenched in dressing that it was just overly saturated and soupy from the dressing.

After explaining to her that I was experiencing a stomach ache and was upset she gave us the wrong cheese, she didnt call for a manager. Instead she hands me a coupon for a free appetizer with a purchase of an entree. 

Why do you even offer alternatives for people who have food allergies when your servers dont even pay attention to things that are serious like that? Take it off the menu if your servers dont seem to give a rats ass."}
{"text":"Marnie is exceptional.  Tonight she took good care of our picky order requiand has superb sevice eith detailed follow-up.   Considerate,  earm, professional.  

Andres is another great altitude and service waiter. Great at taking care of us.

Good food, good peeps.

Great place."}
{"text":"First time I've eaten at Sammy's.  I ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese appetizer, my BF ordered the Duck Tacos.  We split a  10\" Pizza and a Messy Sundae.

The food was good.  But for the money I think the portions were way too small.  The server was pleasant.

The bill came, and it was wrong.  We went on a Tuesday and they were offering half off a second appetizer which was charged at full price.  I'd recommend checking your ticket before handing over your money.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience, but for the $60 I spent I think I would probably choose another place to eat."}
{"text":"Rude hostess- I asked to be seated in an area that was easily accessible and not near dirty plates lingering on the table. I pointed out two locations. To each she said, \"You can't sit there.\" I replied, \"ok\" then left. I'm glad I did.  Another reviewer said their child got food poisoning from this place."}
{"text":"While out to lunch when the restaurant first opened on 6/28/13, I purchased the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine with Jalapenos, specifically requesting no jalapenos. It was explained to the waiter that I have a reaction to jalapenos and they should be left out.  My son ordered the same item, with jalapenos. While washing my hands, the orders arrived at our table, delivered by a female runner. She specifically stated that my plate had no jalapenos. After tasting the item. it tasted spicy. My son stated the runner said my order had no jalapenos. So I began eating the food. I was not able to finish even 1/2 of it. They had mixed up the orders in the kitchen. After leaving the restaurant, I became extremely ill in a grocery store. My family drove me home. After being in bed for 2 days, I went to the ER. There they discovered the jalapeno peppers caused an effect called Severe Colitis brought on by the jalapeno peppers. They also discovered I had IBD, which I was unaware of at the time. 
To sum things up, Sammy's corporate office did nothing after I asked to be compensated for their error. The regional chef admitted that it was an error in the kitchen and an error in the recipe. Still, they did not even offer to compensate me for our bill, much less my ER and additional expenses. I was sent 3-$25 gift certificates as compensation and an apology. If someone with a more extensive form of the illness had eaten this item, they could have died. 
Please use care when ordering any menu items and reconsider ordering anything with an ingredient that does not agree with you or that you are definitely allergic. They do not show any concern. You will be on your own.  I myself will not be eating at any Sammy's again. Plus, they use paper napkins. The prices are not economical. For $20 per person, plus tip, you should at least receive a cloth napkin.
Update:
The legal department handled my complaint. They ended up paying for the ER and doctor bills. Would not reimburse me for the MRI."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic lunch today at Sammy's on Sahara. Great service. Great food. We tried the beet salad, these marinated wok sesame shishito fried peppers and three types of delicious pizza - margarita, pesto and New York. I couldn't decide which was better. Definitely worth another visit soon.... And the messy Sunday is just that. But yum-O!"}
{"text":"Didn't eat here.  Just had 4 beers for 40 bucks.  It was hotter than the hubs of hell and filled with little fruit flies everywhere. I know it's in an airport, but come on....$10 a damn beer!!!"}
{"text":"Food is as you would expect , good but on the average side.  Long ago I ordered salmon which they grill on the wood fire.  MIstake.  well done and super dry.   that being said my favorite thing on the menu is actually the kobe beef sliders.  I don't know if they are actually kobe beef but I find them tasty albeit somewhat reminiscent of White Castle!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. Wine, food and pizza were all ordered. All were terrible. Burrata Pesto Pizza=Gross. Balsamic Chicken salad=Gross. Wine=Gross. The only good thing about this place-our waitress was 1/2 way decent. Never coming again. Ever."}
{"text":"We were going for Mexican but changed our minds when we saw their sign.   We love to try pizza restaurants when we travel.  Seated quickly,  waitress came in a few minutes, we ordered drinks and looked over the menu.  We ordered a small Greek salad to share and it was large enough to satisfy both of us.  We also ordered a New York pizza which was delicious and not salty. Desserts looked interesting but we were full.  Service was good and food was great."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great staff!  The Brussels sprouts, salads, pizza and wine are all great.  If you've never been then this is a must try."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Goat cheese, pear pizza is to die for.  HH is a great deal where all the tapas are half off I believe, and they have great ones. Not the place I would go for a super fun atmosphere, rather relaxed. Drinks are $2 off for HH and the cucumber cooler drink was splendid and refreshing."}
{"text":"Wine selection is decent but if you're a beer drinker, not much going on here at all. Bud light, shocktop and a few others, would be nice if they at least offered some decent craft brews! Even a a good IPA or something would be great. 
Aside from the drinks, the food is always good. Pizza are most excellent, a fave of mine is the BBQ chicken pizza. I love the Wagyu burger too."}
{"text":"In the past 3 or so months this place has gotten a lot better. The staff is always friendly the food taste great. You can always find a manager now and the service is one of the top notch they have really stepped up their game. Keep it up they have a great happy hour 7 days a week as well."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!  Great food and great people! Our favorite is Jamie C. he is excellent and we get the best customer service from him!  Ask for him the next time you go and I promise you will be astonished!!!!"}
{"text":"Alright. I am giving this place the benefit of 2 stars when it was a 1.5 star experience. First, our waiter was inattentive--no refills at all, didn't come by to check on us after he delivered our food, and nary a smile in sight. 

I should have stuck with the pizza or salad--what I had initially wanted until I saw a Tequila-Lime Chicken Fettucine. Always looking for inventive dishes, I made up my mind quickly and ordered that. When it arrived it had zero flavor and was sitting in a puddle of oil--usually meaning the sauce had separated because it was not fresh. I cannot stress enough how much this tasted like nothing: not tequila, not lime, not really even the oil it was bathing in. I was really disappointed.

My aunt ordered a Greek salad--slightly more flavorful, but really lacking the true \"Greek-ness\" I would like in a salad. The winner of the afternoon, and what I should have ordered, was the pizza that my cousin ordered. Just a plain cheese and pretty flavorful, though what is going on with the crust? I dunno, it seemed, again, lacking in flavor. 

Having never been to Sammy's and not really even knowing it existed until today, I am really not impressed. I found it truly gross and disappointing. I liked the decor--it was clean and didn't seem like it was in a strip mall. But I will not be back to this or any Sammy's."}
{"text":"Stopped in early Saturday afternoon and opted to sit on the patio since it was such a beautiful day out and the outdoor dining area looked cozy & inviting. My Hubby and I both opted for pizza although some of the other items certainly sounded enticing. 

That was pretty much the extent of our enjoyable experience. My Hubby asked for no onions on his pizza and, yep, he got onions. Lots of red onion. Since our server seemed a bit scattered, my Husband just picked the onions off. I was also hoping for another cocktail but, again, the server seemed oblivious to our table so I just nursed my glass of water. Once we finished eating we waited for the bill and a box for our left overs. And we waited. Not sure why we were waiting so long as it really wasn't busy-- at all. So, needless to say, I got up and asked the hostess for a box & our bill. After boxing up our leftover pizza we waited for the server to finish ringing up our bill so we could sign the copy and head out... and again we waited. The server finally walked by but in a flurry so I had to basically yell at him to get his attention so we could finalize our bill. 

Unfortunately, the poor service completely negated any enjoyment from the actual meal. So, we won't be returning especially where it was pretty far out of our way anyhow."}
{"text":"I date myself so...I took myself here for dinner.  I have been here before on vacation but not since I have moved here, so it's been awhile.  The pizza was good, it's not something I am going to crave, I got plain pepperoni.  The crisp Brussels sprouts that I got as an appetizer were okay.  They weren't very crispy. They were hot and mushy.  I have only had Brussels sprouts once before in my life so maybe they are supposed to be like that? They had a very \"toasty\" burnt taste and a truckload of balsamic. They also STUNK! Holy moly.  I had the salted caramel pudding but it didn't taste salty to me at all.  Is there some sea salt that should have been sprinkled or was the top layer of sauce supposed to be salted caramel sauce?  It tasted super buttery.  I am not complaining believe me I nearly licked the glass clean. The service from my server was great.  I didn't catch her name.  I did see the manager on her floor using her smart phone and one of the kitchen employees was giving the to go guy a back massage in full view of patrons.  Hey I am for sneaking peaks at your phone and we all need a stress relief sometime anyone who's worked in the food service industry knows that to be true, but maybe those things can take place in the BOH."}
{"text":"Had amazing service from Lexi. She was one of the BEST waitresses I have ever had. She was truly great. The food was,great but the service was better. Thanks Lexi."}
{"text":"I enjoy Sammy's.  My family & I eat at Sammy's often.  I was meeting a colleague here for lunch and have never been to this particular location.  I think it's one of the newer locations in town.

The service was pretty good, our server made sure our iced teas were kept full.

Since it was a business lunch, I decided not to pig out and went for the Kobe Cheeseburger Sliders.  Normally, I would get a pizza and some appetizers, but I didn't have my wife, son, and mother to back me up and help me out with the chow....so, sliders it was.

They were cooked to my liking and I love how they are topped with Gorgonzola & Cheddar Cheese.....yum!  The only bad thing is that I really didn't want fries and I'm not a fan of Cole Slaw....but there was no substitutes, so I went with the fries....there went the diet!  I asked about a side salad and the server said the only size of side salad they had could feed 2 people!  What the hell?!  I hope they change that somewhere down the road because I can't pig out like that on business lunches.

In any case, the lunch was enjoyable.

Will I return?  You bet your Sammy's I will!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday around 11:30am. 

Service: I was here for a work meeting. I was greeted right away and seated at one of the booths along the window. When my guest arrived they sat next to me and then we were promptly greeted again. Service was great at first and then quickly dwindled as our time there progressed. At one point we were completely ignored even trying to get their attention. My guest had his glass only 1/4 of the way down and was offered a refill on his soda. I was 1/4 of my glass left (ice included) and I never got a refill on my soda. I even pushed my glass out so it was clearly visible and nothing..... 

Food: 

Appetiser- Chicken Lettuce Cups.  This was a delicious combination of chicken, water chestnuts, scallions, hoisin sauce and sesame seeds. They provided a generous ration of chicken to accompany the butter lettuce. 

Meal- I ordered the Oak Roasted Salmon Filet with the Asian salad, edamame, cucumber & ponzu sauce. I LOVE all of these ingredients. BUT... I did NOT love this dish. There was just something about it lacking flavor and depth. I so badly wanted to like my food but I didn't. I could not even finish it and had to stop eating, push it to the side to and just continued to talk during my meeting.

Service(cont.): After several attempts to get ANY waitresses attention, they finally came by and offered a box. I took one for the lettuce wraps. When she came back with the boxes she also had the check. I had to ask for our dessert. I mean aren't they supposed to be watching you get close to finishing and then ask if you want dessert? There was no line to eat so it could not be that they were rushing to get people in and out. Not sure if that is just how they do it. 

For dessert, I ordered the flourless chocolate cake. The cake tasted great. The banana sauce topped with walnuts might as well have just been taken from a baby food jar (-walnuts). If you like banana baby food then you will LOVE it. (I know adult people that do so I'm not knocking it)

Overall I wish I ordered a pizza and maybe my experience would have been better. Sadly, I doubt I'll ever come back which is unfortunate since this is an area I frequent for work meetings. I left a 15% tip even though service and food was less than desirable only because I know many people in the food industry."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time. Just went here this week for lunch had absolutely the worst service I've ever had. The waiter was basically throwing our food on the table no personality at all. Never got refills on drinks. Ordered pasta with chicken and the pasta came out with no chicken. 20 minutes later he decides to bring the chicken ... I told him we were done eating - didn't want the chicken alone?! Then came the bill .. Total did not have the chicken on it so I gave my card - then he ran my card for a totally different total ( charging me for the chicken I never got !!) Total thievery !i got the manager involved who did nothing but told me the reversed charge on my card would take up to 3 days to come off ?! Really ... 
Sucks ! They don't take care of their customers and don't resolve problems when the fault  is clearly theirs. I was told I would receive something by email to compensate me of course I never received it"}
{"text":"How does this place average four stars?

My waitress was pleasant, if not prompt.

The pizza was meh.  I figured if it was in the name, that it would be worth ordering.  The pepperoni pizza had a dry crust, too little sauce, too little cheese, and lacked flavor.  I didn't particularly enjoy it.  The duck tacos 'tapas' was okay, but lacking in flavor.  The ceasar salad had very little dressing on it, and some of the lettuce was wilted.  I had the second-worst hurricane (a mixed-drink made with rum and fruit-juice) I've had to date here.  It included a straw that was shorter than the glass it was in.

I didn't leave hungry, but wasn't terribly pleased about that.  I also spent more than I was happy with for what I got.  I would have been fine with the cost had the food been as good as I had been led to believe it should have been from the other reviews."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Pizza is excellent, appetizers and deserts are are also very good. Price is reasonable and service is fast and smooth. I almost forgot you must try their caesar salad with special salad dressing you will crave for some more."}
{"text":"Spent 20 minutes signing up on the website. All to find out that this address is not even on the website. Oh well. I guess Ill eat there when their tech department feels it has enough time to add this location."}
{"text":"Sammy's always serves up tasty fare, even if the wait staff can be lacking.  Even though they have pizza in their name, they have a ton of other great options from tapas to salads to entrées.  They also have a $9 off coupon on the Entertainment book app.  

This visit I ordered the Grilled Shrimp Salad ($14.75) which is so flavorful and the shrimp are large and juicy.  The balsamic and feta pair so well with the shrimp and it is definitely filling.  

A friend ordered the Oak Roasted Chicken ($16.50) I recommended and loved it as well.  She only wished she had more pesto sauce because it was so good.

Our food was great, but the wait time for service knocked this down one star.  There were 4 or 5 servers and only as many occupied tables, so it should not take 10 minutes before someone takes your drink order and even longer before they take your meal order (especially when you tell them you're ready to order when they bring the beverages)."}
{"text":"What a great experience. I communicated with Sammy's over email to organize my rehearsal dinner and was able to confirm all the details including a special menu for a set amount of guests. They took care of our entire party the whole night. We were able to accommodate about 20 people during happy hour on a Wednesday for under $400 and we had TONS of food. My guests and I all came from out of state so they appreciated having some left overs. Everything came out on time hot and fresh. My guests were able to buy additional alcohol on their tabs without a problem. Thank you Sammy's for taking good care of us!"}
{"text":"What I figured would be an easy order seemed to be overwhelmingly difficult for the staff to deliver. I simply ordered a pepperoni pizza. My pizza took was ordered 45 minutes ago and nothing has been brought out to me, in fact as I type this I'm actually still waiting. The fact that we ordered two meals and the first one came out within 10 minutes meanwhile my meal never showed is an extremely big deal to a hungry customer. 

Although I don't completely  blame the waitress who attempted to manage her orders as best as she could, I believe organizational operations are dependent on effective management and teamwork. This establishment may serve many hungry airport guests but the style and quality of their service is horrible. 

We ended paying for the first portion of the meal that was received and politely asked for our check so we could leave. As we were preparing to leave which was approximately an hour later, my mystery pizza appeared...crispy and burnt. Needless to say, I declined to accept the pizza and the coat of the late burned pizza was removed from our total tab.

I would love to give this place a double negative rating but the one star will have to suffice. 

Don't eat here, go grab a sub sandwich from a nearby kiosk instead."}
{"text":"I've been to Sammy's a few times. It isn't my go-to place but when I'm in the area and we are all craving something different it will do. The menu is very eclectic. On my last visit I ordered the sliders and fish tacos and split both with my daughter. The sliders won hands down. I would not order the tacos again. The wine list needs to be updated but the service is always good."}
{"text":"Love the tropical tea offered here. My husband and I split a salad and a pizza for a  delicious meal. The messy sundae is a delight!
Great wait staff."}
{"text":"I have eaten pizza all over the world being the Italian I am.  Yes, I know my pizza, YUM.

Sammy's is Awesome and can hold its own with some of the best pizza places  I have been to!

The atmosphere is awesome, feels like a mom n pop restaurant!

The staff is very professional and took care of the table at all levels.

The pricing was very reasonable!

I love woodfired pizza, it smells so good, tastes great, and looks delicious.

This is a must go for everybody!  After eating there you will go back!

There are many other things on the menu so all can enjoy Sammy's

See you there and let me know how it was!"}
{"text":"Went in yesterday for a quick pizza on the go.  Great taste and very delicious! Thank you"}
{"text":"I was greeted with 'do you have 40 minutes to dine.'  This Sammys is in Mc Carren international. Serves a very limited menu for breakfast so not sure why it would or could take 40 minutes. Food was average. Service good and it took 15 minutes to get my food. The tables were a mess. Hadn't been cleaned and no one was in there. If that greeter worked for me. She'd be gone. She set the wrong expectation and let the tables stay unavailable. Poor!"}
{"text":"Usually get the to go service which is great and convenient. Mini duck tacos are a fun little appetizer. The BBQ chicken pizza has to be the best in Vegas. The gouda cheese in conjunction with the cilantro and the zesty BBQ sauce is a threesome of flavors. Also tried the lobster mac n cheese and the Kobe beef chili. Lobster mac was excellent, but the serving size is tiny. Three bites and gone!  The Kobe beef chili is good, but not fantastic. Nothing special that would make you want to pay extra money because the word Kobe is used. Want to try that oozing gooey goodness of a dessert they call a sundae. Maybe next visit!"}
{"text":"Me and my family used to go a lot for this restaurant used to to be a good place but yesterday me and my husband and my kids been there and it was terrible I got a hair inside my food twice the kids pasta the cream it was expired and the red pasta the flavor of it it was terrible they used a pizza sauce for pasta so my recommendation find yourself a different restaurant to go"}
{"text":"Mozzarella Cheese pizza but with vegan (Daiya) cheese, plus added bell peppers and mushrooms is great! I appreciate that their menu is clearly marked with vegan/vegetarian options. They are a little expensive for me but it was worth it."}
{"text":"if you're going out for pizza go someplace else.  that being said, if you just want to gamble, grab a drink and maybe snack on something, Sammy's is a decent choice.  the pizza is edible but not very memorable.  it was much better in san diego when they first opened.  I do like the caeser salad with chicken.  in fact, their roasted chicken breast is reason enough to go to sammys.  it's full of flavor and juicy with a nice char.  I don't care at all for the Asian and fusion direction they have gone to in recent years."}
{"text":"For airport food, this is actually pretty good- and there's lots of vegetarian-friendly options.  Seating is comfortable and plenty, and you can have/avoid TVs as is your wont.  Also, it seems to be in a quieter part of the airport, so it's nice to just sit there.  The beer is also good.  Standard pizza/pub fare won't let you down.  Prices are kind of high, but you're in an airport, so, you know, you're in an airport."}
{"text":"So here we are,  Sammy's on a Tuesday night,  7:15 good crowd.
My wife and I had chili and split the mini kobe burgers. Everything was hot and flavorful. Service was good too."}
{"text":"I needed a quick dinner with some leftovers.  I had been to this Sammy's for a Yelp event several years ago and decided to give it a go.  I phoned my order for an Italian sausage and a NY Style pizza.  The person on the phone told me it would be 10 to 15 minutes.  I immediately left and got there just as they were about to be removed from the oven.

During the payment time, Beto, the man at the counter, asked how In was going to enjoy the pizza at home--with a beer?  When I said no, I would be having iced tea, he went to the counter and got me a take out container of their passion fruit iced tea to try compliments of Sammy's.  Nice touch.

The pizzas were good.  There's nothing special about them as far as gourmet topping but I wasn't looking for that.  This is OK standard, chain pizza, and it was a nice change from what I normally get.  And the leftovers make wonderful breakfast when you eat the slices cold out of the refrigerator with plenty of red pepper sprinkled on top!"}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza and then about 10 mins later a guy Sat next to me at the bar and ordered the same pizza. A pizza came out 5 mins later after he ordered and the staff have him the puzza. I waited 10 more mins and asked for the check.  Paid it an left as he tried to give me  pizza to carry on the plane but I cannot carry on extra.items let alone I wanted relax an eat fresh pizza.  They screwed up and I bet still charged me. I will never eat here such a screw up by staff in giving my food away. Ps I almost missed my flight"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with tomato basil soup, it tasted like tomato sauce right out of a can,  The soup was drenched with olive oil. Yuck! I sent it back but apparently the waitress insisted the soup I \"really\" wanted was the lobster bisque soup\" I told her I don't like lobster so I can assure you I know my what soup iv'e been ordering for the last 3 years,  According to the cook the soup hasn't changed since 2001 that what he told her. Oh please give me break I use to come to Sammy's strictly for the basil soup and it's not the same!  So my next course of meal I ordered which was  Spicy Thai Grilled Chicken tasted like it was 3 week old salad with saggy chicken! Nasty! I will never go again! Sadly Sammy's on Sahara is no longer a place for good food and good service."}
{"text":"Food was great!! Service was good. Me and my fiancé had the BBQ chicken pizza along with the Japanese Chicken Meatballs and Mediterranean sampler. Everything was great!! The meatballs were sweet and spicy and so were the cucumbers. The sampler was baba ganoush, Evoo and  hummus else with warm pita bread. It was really good. Prices were great also. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"This location is convenient. But the food, meh. Our flatbread was overdone, so it was crunchy instead of chewy and didn't have the flavor it should have had. The BBQ chicken pizza wasn't that great...keep in mind that it's just at THIS LOCATION. We always drive the extra miles to go to the Sammy's on Rainbow/215. That location is great, the food is ALWAYS, ALWAYS cooked to perfection and tastes great. We go so much, the manager knows us and we have our preferred/favorite server, Gwen. She's great!!! If you don't mind the drive, I recommend that location....especially if you don't want to have stomach aches from the greasy foods from THIS location on Sahara. Our faves are the BBQ chicken pizza (made with Gouda), spicy chicken meatballs, crab and shrimp dip and the hummus.

NOTE: happy hour is from 3-6pm daily and most of the appetizers are half off as well as discounted prices on wine and beer."}
{"text":"The service was slow we had to remind the waitress to bring us our water the food was okay. With no leadership taking action , we had to go up to the counter ask for Parmesan cheese and also give them the check and the credit card so we could leave. The food is mediocre at best for the service to be so slow, especially in Las Vegas given all the competition a great places for places to eat. It's okay you have all the time the world. I don't plan on returning any time soon"}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (11 of 365).

The best time to come here: HAPPY HOUR!  All tapas are half off!

Must order items:
- Duck Tacos!  My ultimate favorite tapas plate here!
- Crispy Coconut Shrimp
- Mac n' Cheese
- Dumplings

Dessert must try: Mini donuts w/ a side of ice cream. Yum!

This is a great place to come in a small group and share the small plates paired with a glass of wine.  Waiters/Waitresses are super nice here, and the ambiance is splendid.  Make sure to be seated at a booth!  Great date place too!"}
{"text":"I end up eating here more often than I would think I would.  It is close to the gate that I am normally departing from and for some reason, I feel that I have to get to the Las Vegas airport really early to get through security and my flight is right during a meal time.

I have really only ordered the pizza here and I am usually with a co-worker.  At some point, I will remember that the two of us can share a pizza.  A single pizza is just too big for one normal person to eat.  The pizza is OK, it is not something that I walk away saying wow that was amazing.  They are very generous with the cheese and you will be able to make big long strings of cheese from your pizza.

I can normally find a good beer here as well.  The wait staff are attentive and the cook time has always been resonable.  In a pinch it works, and the pizza is OK."}
{"text":"Jay, the manager got back to me and apologized for my not so great experience.  I so much appreciate when establishments really value Yelp feedback and are steadfast in making things right. I was welcomed back and promised superior service and for that I will give Sammy's another try:)"}
{"text":"Sammy's happy hour is pretty great!  

$2 off beer and wine and 1/2 price all tapas.  

This means 2 people can have a smorgasbord of apps and a drink with tax and tip for around $40.  

We have tried treasures such as the fried tofu, chicken meatballs, babaganoush, hummus, potstickers, parmesan crusted artichokes, and cheesy garlic bread.

The hummus, babaganoush and garlic cheesy bread are HEAVY on the garlic.  I like it very much but it may not be for everyone!

WARNING: The Parmesan crusted artichokes are stuffed with goat cheese; this is not on the menu and serves a nasty surprise for those who do not like goat cheese!

The chicken meatballs come with a delightful side of spicy pickled cucumbers.  yum.  They are a winner.  The fried tofu comes with a tasy miso sauce.  Also very good.  

All in all a good choice for happy hour.  Many items to choose from at bargain prices of $3.50 - $6. and a glass of wine for $5 to wash it all down.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"As airport bar/restaurants go this isn't a bad place at all to spend at little time waiting for your boarding call.   Wood fired pizza oven prepares a tasty pie.  Would definitely recommend it.   Cold beer and a friendly wait  staff rounds out the pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Duck Tacos FTW!!!!  This is a great chain, great location, and great kitchen.  I have never had a bad meal here.  The restaurant has remained clean even know it has been here for some years."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to check this place out for a while!I ordered a new York pizza!! It was very delicious!! Marnie was our server! She was awesome! Very outgoing with a sense of humor!!! I will definitely be back!!!! If you have a chance check this place out and ask for Marnie!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times but to be fair, I've never actually had pizza at this place which has \"pizza\" in it's name. This review is for the salads, which is all I've had.

I came here yesterday, 4/14/16 and picked up a salad for lunch. Kudos to Sammy's for providing gluten free and vegan options on their menu! And thanks to vegan Yelpers for the tip! I called in and ordered the vegan Red Quinoa salad sans tomatoes. You have a choice of the individual size ($8.75) or the large size ($13.50). I called in to order so I asked the girl on the phone the difference between the individual and large and she said the individual is 4 cups and the large is 8 cups. I decided on the large since it was double the size for less than double the price and I could just save my leftovers for later in the day. I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I got to the restaurant in 10 minutes and it was ready. Thumbs up for the fast, friendly service!

The salad was yummy! I'm not a beet fan but the Citrus Chili Vinaigrette dressing was delicious and has a little heat to it which pairs well with the mild-flavored beets and the arugula which I always describe as the spicy green. Additionally, the salad had red onions, avocados, scallions, almonds, parsley, supposedly mint (though I did not taste any in my salad), and of course, red quinoa.

I've had one other salad here, the Original Chopped Chicken, a few months ago before my vegan adventure began. I thought it was good but not exceptional, which is why I haven't been dying to come back. However, my concern is the size of the salads. When I ordered the chopped salad, I ordered the individual size which I swear was similar in size to the large I received in the quinoa salad yesterday. I wish I had a picture of the chopped salad to compare the two.The quinoa salad was a big portion so I don't know what I was expecting, family sized maybe? It's possible I just received extra in the chopped salad. Maybe it's different when you dine in but the sizing should be consistent because I spent $13.50 instead of $8.75 and I was little bummed by this.

All in all, I'd say this place is a decent lunch bite and I'm very happy to see healthy, vegan options on the menu. I'm sure I'll be back for their Red Quinoa salad!"}
{"text":"This place had the absolute worst service. It was a  Friday evening at 7:30 pm and there were 3 servers, 1 host, & 1 bartender. The servers are incompetent and inept. I did not observe a manager. 

After 15 minutes of waiting, my server hadn't even greeted me, or even made eye contact to acknowledge me. I had to approach another server and ask who my server was. 

With this restaurant being in an airport terminal, one would think that they would be able to accurately forecast business with flights and passenger traffic. Not the case at all. 


Don't bother eating here if your flight leaves within 1.5 hours of being seated."}
{"text":"For 12.99 they give you a pizza barely bigger than your hand. Not like the Sammy chains."}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE ! I ordered 5 cheese pizza and it's the worst - too much blue cheese and VERY greasy. 
The only  reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is that the waiter is really nice and the food didn't take a long time"}
{"text":"I am here all the time!!! Seriously it's kindof bad how much I eat here and don't cook lol I have ordered in and came in and sat down and I have never had a bad experience not to mention the food is amazing plus my family is full of picky eaters We are a large family full of meat eaters, vegetarians, vegans and even raw foodist and we can all eat here and all love it!! The fact that I eat here atleast 4 times a month (it's probably more but let's just say 4 to make me feel better) :) and I have never had a bad experience and the food is always great says something. Pretty much I love it here :)"}
{"text":"I bought the smallest, overpriced, greasiest pizza in town, the toppings were overcooked and I'm not sure if it was just my pizza or if they serve it like that in general. Regardless, I am never coming back, I feel like little Caesars would have been wayyyyy better."}
{"text":"Asked the waiter about a salad, took her recommendation, and was disappointed we didn't even eat it. The pizza is good not great. Food is average, but for pizza the price is above average."}
{"text":"Came here since H&R was closed due to a private tasting party.  Right off the bat, our bartender was really cool and made us felt very welcome as we were walking in.  We sat a the table in the lounge since the restaurant itself was close off.  Ordered a couple items off the tapas portion since they were half off due to happy hour.

Nothing really stood out, but the duck tacos.  It was the only item I had to look up on the menu to see what i was eating, but it's still not enough to have me coming back.  This is a harsh review, but I guess i am taking it out on Sammys since H&R was closed.  Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Had lunch with some friends.  One thing I noticed about my food choices lately is that I tend to eat something from a restaurant that they do not specialize in.  I recently gone to seafood restaurants and got a steak.  Cheeseburger joints and got chicken.  Even a Mexican restaurant and got a hamburger.  And now a pizza place and ended up getting a salmon fillet with their lobster bisque.  

I have to say, not too many places can mess up salmon.  This place was no different.  The salmon was made just right, grilled, tasty, and flaky.  The waitress was extra helpful too.  I originally requested for 2 fillets because one is never enough for me.  She told me to just order one and she'll find the largest piece for me.  I guess she knew that I needed at least 8 oz to be satisfied.  I got about 8 oz like she promised.  12 oz would have been perfect though. But beggars can't be choosers.  

My group was a bit rowdy for lunch.  I'm glad that there wasn't too many kids around because we went overboard a couple of time.  Our waitress was very helpful and what I liked the most, she never interrupted our conversation.  When it came to the bill, each of us handed separate cards.  Without even asking, the waitress split the bills for us.  I never got our waitress's name, but she was great.  It's not easily dealing with a rowdy group like us.  

Tons of eats in this shopping center.  For lunch time, wasn't busy at all.  Next time I come in, I promise to get a pizza."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of seven. The host was a little confused on how/where to seat us. Maybe do a refresher training on seating. Our waiter was friendly, but was wearing WAY too much cologne!!! But i guess we at least could smell him coming! 
I was SUPER excited to see that they had Lebni!!!! It is one of my favorite things to eat, and it is rare to find it at a restaurant. It was delicious. We also ordered truffle fries, also delicious!! And for the main course we ordered the goat cheese pizza. That too, was delicious! The crust had a little bit of a different taste that I couldn't put my finger on, but it was good. Our friends ordered the duck tacos, some dumplings?, 5 cheese pizza and some sort of pasta. They all enjoyed their meals as well.
To top it all off we all enjoyed the free messy Sunday that we got for free for checking in! What a great treat! 
Thank you, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Food this past trip was really a 4 but we went with 3 other couples and service was 6 stars!  It cannot be easy with a larger party, half who are first timers and who dont stop talking to decide what they want.  We started with a bunch of tapas for happy hour and ended passing several desserts around, I missed the doughnuts but got lucky and got the end of the messy sundae!!  Everyone had a great time and we loved sharing everything, ordering more as we needed it.  Both managers came by to help our running server and check in with us.  Great fun and casual place."}
{"text":"Happy hour mini duck tacos amazing
My new favorite.  Give them a try. Outside patio on a sunny afternoon.  The happy hour beer and wine specials."}
{"text":"Airport food is usually hit or miss. If it's tasty, you had to lease a kidney to pay for it. If it's nasty, you've usually given over an arm and a leg. No matter what, you end up feeling like someone missed the lubricant necessary to make the experience enjoyable. After a week of SUPER high priced dining in Vegas, this place was a pleasant surprise. Affordable, tasty, prompt and pleasant. 

The pizza I ordered, Margherita, was delicious. Nice and cheesy with whole, thick slices of Roma tomatoes and freshly chopped basil. It was a thin crusted slightly crunchy, slightly chewy pizza that was perfectly executed. Deeeeelicious!  My mom and daughter had lobster bisque. They devoured it happily and then ordered a Margherita as well. 

My son ordered a grilled chicken wrap. He enjoyed it...the fries, I was told, were like barbecue chips. He polished them off. I tasted a bit of the wrap...it was nice!

The only negative part of my experience was the manager forcing us to pay so he could close our the register.  I wish he had made all of that clear before we ordered additional food.  It was akin to here is your food and receipt.  Pay quick, eat quick, GET OUT.  He ruined the perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"I wish I could break the review down to two parts - \"The Pizza\" and \"The Rest\"

I have been here several times and their pizza is awesome. I personally like the \"New York\" pizza and have never been disappointed.

I have also had the balsamic chicken salad a few times and it is also good, but not as good on the good scale as the pizza.

Where they fall short, starters and appetizers.  Because the individual pizza is filling, I usually stay away from the appetizers and starter items.  However, today I was in the mood for something new.  It was raining so I figured it was a good soup day.  I ordered Lobster Bisque - VERY tasty but $8 bucks for a small sized bowl.  I also thought some of the parmesan crusted artichokes sounded good.  Nope, they were not good and they were $10 for basically one artichoke heart cut into 4 pieces.  I felt a little violated here.  

Service is always adequate - never bad but never anything above and beyond and that's ok with me too.

I would recommend this place for the pizza and because it's very good, I gave the 4 stars.  I would have only given 3 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"I arrived early for a small party here before the rest of the folks did.  Not a problem, I let them know about how many it would be and ordered an appetizer at the bar area.  It kind of angered me they did not get a table ready for us.  Even after they all arrived they still did not get a table ready, they just sat us all at three seperated places near each other.  I moved from the bar, to a table then moved again to another table still in the same party and I could tell the servers were getting mad.  Really it wouldn't have been a problem if they had just prepared a table for us all in the first place.  Though I shouldn't really complain all of our drinks were re-filled constantly and another server (which was not ours) hid and served a birthday cake for the guest of honor.  The restaraunt smelled great and the food was decent but I doubt I'd come here again."}
{"text":"This is the best Sammy's we've been to! Snoopy is an awesome server and the food was so good we wanted to high five the cook. All in all a fantastical dining experience!"}
{"text":"Never. Again.

About twenty of us were here for dinner last night.  It took a while for all of us to arrive, and when they took our orders, I was one of the last people at the end of the table to order. I asked for a barbecue chicken pizza, no special crust or anything.

A while later, they started to bring our orders out. It probably took close to 10 minutes with all the people, starting with the opposite end of the table. After they got down to my end of the table and got everybody else their orders, I was still waiting for mine. A few minutes later, I asked the server what happened to my order. She went to the kitchen to check, and apparently they didn't start it. OK, I guess. Everybody else is already eating, but I can wait a while longer because they may have missed my order.

My friend had ordered the same pizza, but with a gluten free crust. She offered to trade me a piece now for one of mine later, and I gratefully accepted. At least five minutes later, the server brought out a pizza. But I realized that it was gluten free, not the standard crust. This second mistake was absolutely not acceptable.

Yes, they did finally get my order correct on the 3rd try. But at this point, everybody else had either finished or almost finished eating, and I upset and embarrassed that I had yet to start. The pizza didn't taste as good to me as it might have tasted normally, although I found the slice from my friend to be just average anyway. On top of this, all I got was an apology from the server, not an apology from the manager and definitely not some sort of coupon or discount to make it up to me. That would have saved them at least another star on this review.

Moral of the story: Do not take your large group here. Maybe one companion or a small group is fine, but look somewhere else if you want to make a large group happy.

It's a real shame. I wanted to try their duck tacos during happy hour some time, but it's not going to happen now."}
{"text":"Seems to be the local place to hang out, the place was packed. Large selection of food, I ordered a Salami and sausage pizza, although it was good its just not as good as the pizza inside the Caesars forum shops. I wish we had got her name but our server was outstanding and was working her but off, I will return here again soon"}
{"text":"Best Sammys in town. Food is phenomenal. Duck tacos are the BEST! Service is top notch. We met the general manager Erin today and she was amazing! Love this place and I highly  recommend it to everyone! We keep going back for more!!! Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A nice place to go for salads - their beet salad is particularly enjoyable. Service can be a little heavy handed and their wine selection is poor."}
{"text":"My first time there 3 weeks ago. We ordered a Margarita pizza and the Kobe beef chili. It was great. Tonight we ordered two chili's for take out. I got home to find that one container was a bit more than 3/4 of the way filled and the other was a little more than half filled. At $7.50 a bowl, we got cheated out of what we payed for. Disappointed with Sammy's Woodfired Pizza."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is always clean and beautiful.  The food is great and the servers are awesome. We had truffle fries, crab & shrimp dip, and a margarita pizza. So yummy! My 8 year old loves the food too."}
{"text":"We recently met up with a couple of friends for drinks in a nearby tavern so when dinner came our friend suggested we go.  I have never been so and I love Za's and eat them not often enough.

We walked in to a warm inviting decor.  Seated promptly and order taking quickly and efficiently.  We each ordered our own small size to share with the table with appetizers.  That is a mistake unless you REALLY like left overs!  OMG so much food.  But everything I tried was good expect one but that was personal taste nothing to do with the Za.  The ops came first as it should then the za everything had the wood fire flavor, I really liked that! 

Will defiantly be back but will leave with less to-go bags."}
{"text":"I like Sammy's. I like the food. I like the service. We were seated quickly and out order was taken as soon as we were ready. We did wait for a bit for our food. That was fine. Here's the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5: please don't put suggested tip amounts on my check. I'm an intelligent adult whose smart phone has a calculator. I can figure out the gratuity on my own, and in fact, if it's warranted. In this case our server, Brianna, was lovely. Corporate, take the suggestion and take that crap off the bill, it's insulting."}
{"text":"My co worker and I brought a client here for lunch on a Monday. Located in a large strip center where parking is no issue. We arrived before the noon hour so the place was bare and we got a choice table.

After receiving our beverages our friendly waitress took our orders. I went with the chicken and hummus wrap and picked the side of cole slaw. Our food arrived promptly and my wrap was healthy tasting but flavorful and the slaw was decent too.

We were in and out without a hitch and I would recommend Sammy's for a business or personal luncheon."}
{"text":"Good pizza.   Tight seating since everyone has a bag or two.    It is pricey because they have a captive audience. The drink prices are heavy.     But as I said good pizza"}
{"text":"I come here for their duck tacos! You can get them for half off during happy hour from 4-6pm. I'm completely obsessed with them.  
As for the rest of their food, I haven't had anything from them that I wasn't happy with. Pizzas are good! However, sometimes service is kind of...mediocre. But for the food quality and happy hour, I give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"I love me some pizza!

I have been going to Sammy's for years now and I am always pleased after each meal.  I really like this particular location.  It usually isn't super packed and I have never had to wait for a table.  The service is always really good and friendly.  

And the pizzas, oh the pizzas!  I am absolutely in love with the 5 cheese pizza.  I have an ongoing love affair with cheese, so I of course had to try this pizza the very first time I went to a Sammy's location all those years ago.  It has been about 5 years now and I am still ordering the amazingly delicious 5 funky cheese pizza.  I mean it has smoked gouda, raclette, romano, mozzarella, and gorgonzola...what isn't to like?  My second favorite is the Goat Cheese Pizza with it's lovely spinach and sautéed mushrooms, it is simply a thing of beauty.   If funky pizzas aren't your thing, they also have the \"normal\" pizzas like pepperoni that are also delightful.  Yum.

On top of the pizzas, they also have a huge menu of salads, pastas, wraps, and steak.  I am also rather found of their tapas and appetizers like duck tacos, hummus, dumplings, satays, and lobster mac n' cheese.  Everything I have tried has been awesome.  It is so fun to be able to get a little bit of Asian, Mediterranean, Italian, and American comfort foods all in one setting.  This is the beauty of America, our great melting pot of wonderful food!  This is also why I am not a size 2, I love food wayyyyyyy to much.

And the perfect way to end a meal is Sammy's Messy Sundae.  It truly is a hot mess, but oh so good!  It will make anyone happy with the chocolate, caramel, whipped cream, and ice cream.  Oh la la!  It does come with nuts though, so if you are anti-nut, order it without the nuts.  I actually think it is better sans nuts myself.

So get on over to Sammy's and have yourself a fun culinary tour of the world.  Your tummy will thank you for it!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Sammy's, and a bigger fan of their Thai Chicken Pizza. When I am in Vegas this is one of the place I like to get to. The service here is always quite friendly. As well if you can stand the heat they have a nice patio area to eat on. Last but not least the happy hour specials are also quite nice. As you can get half price tapas after midnight. For me it always comes back to the Thai Chicken Pizza. Yum. Can't wait till the next time I am in Vegas so I can get some of this none traditional pizza."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed their pizza and the salad! They have a nice ambience where you can have your meal peacefully. The service was good and the food came out fast! I like this location."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and helpful with all my vegan questions and requests. And the food was super good my fiance loved his BBQ chicken with smoked Gouda. And the hummus and fries were great. Are server was very friendly also, I couldn't eat it but their HUGE dessert look so yummy made me wish I wasn't vegan haha or that they had substitute everything."}
{"text":"Sammy's is one of my all time favorite places.  My parents, who are super picky, loved it too.  The appetizers were awesome.  The lebni was so tasty, and we liked it so much that we even requested some extra spice blend that comes on the bread to add to other dishes.  The salads were top notch:  very fresh.  The pizza is amazing!!!  My favorite is the Dorothea...a Sammy's exclusive speciality.  

At first, I thought this was just another pizza place, but oh how I was mistaken.  I really like eating here even more than the 5 star restaurants at the strip."}
{"text":"This Place is most excellent.  It has:

a) Great atmosphere: cozy and comfortable, friendly waiters, interesting layout and decor.

b) Great Food:  The pizzas had crispy and tasty crust (perfectly cooked), the cheese and sauce were the perfect amount of taste (not overwhelming the pizza), the toppings where fresh and plentiful.

c) Not much waiting: Greeted and Seated right away.  Ordered withing five minutes of sitting.  Carafe of water at table is a plus.  Took about eight minutes to receive pizza.

d) Desert:  Monday is \"Messy Sunday\" Day.  Free \"Messy Sunday\" with an order over $30.  Here is the kicker.  The bill didn't quite make it to $30 but the waitress gave us one anyway.  It says a lot that they are willing to go the extra mile for their customers.

Definitely Try this place at least once.  Each pizza is a personal size.  I'd like to come back and try them all."}
{"text":"Our server Allie was the best!   I must say this as she was 100% attentive and professional.  Unfortunately, the food and menu need some updating.   

Again the server was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast and ate at the bar.  I had wonderful service and had the breakfast pizza.  Pizza was cooked to perfection but it was too much food for one person.  There are not many decent food options in terminal D.  Prices are reasonable and are only slightly more than the many fast food options nearby,  Stop in here and indulge on woodfired pizza cooked right in front of you. I most certainly will be back on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Great friendly vibe. Its a chain but the food and service does not reflect that. Very fresh ingredients, creative choices and amazing service. Great everyday dining due to quality, prices and healthy options."}
{"text":"Ok, it's Airport food, so my expectations were low. However, I opted for a Mediterranean soft cheese plate, and I was pretty pleased with my selection. The soft cheese was light and tasty, prefect base for my 11 hour flight to come. 

I have to say that my time here was pretty relaxing, and if I were stuck in this airport again, I'd check Sammy's out again."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times over the past year and each time I have been there I have had a different server and each one of them have given amazing service.  They won't even let a piece of straw wrapping stay on the table for long.  The duck tacos are my absolute favorite item!  If you like duck, cilantro, tomatoes and goat cheese you will be in taco heaven!!!  I don't eat the pizzas very much but I have tried every tapas item and most of the salads.  The Caesar salad is a bit disappointing as are the dessert selection but everything else is up to par- especially for the prices.  There is also outdoor seating and decent happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Nice little pizza plus place in the burbs of Vegas. A service was great and waiter very attentive. Apps were brought out quickly and lobster bisque was very tasty, chili was so so. Pizzas were very good and plenty enough to even share. Two of us has salads that were massive. Balsamic chicken salad was personal favorite, but plenty of food for table with leftovers to go home. Caught in a downpour and waiter offered to fashion some paper hats for us put of the kids menus. Nice touch"}
{"text":"Mmmm!!! Organic arugula and pear woodfired pizza AND a passion fruit iced tea. 

My favorite comfort food at my old hangout.

=)"}
{"text":"Excellent New York pizza away from NY and delicious desert: donuts w/raspberry sauce. I'll will definitely be back! Worth the trip. Great service also Mr. Godfrey."}
{"text":"I come to this location often and I have never been disappointed with service or quality of food. I recommend the Garlic Bread and the Chopped Chicken Salad. Loses a star because they no longer offer the half size salad portion. Seems a little cheap on their part."}
{"text":"Really like the gluten offerings at this restaurant. The pizzas taste fantastic, and some friends even get gluten free crusts for theirs as well because it tastes so good. The atmosphere is relaxed and a mix between casual and dressy casual. Perfect for friends, family, and dates. Or by yourself, not judging your life. (: 
It's a bit pricy though so come prepared to spend a little more than a basic sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. On a pretty strict diet...had gluten free crust, vegan cheese, and the vegetarian pizza. Tasted better than any vegetarian pizza I've ever had. But food aside...our waitress, Katie, was amazing!  Personable. Attentive. Knowledgeable. Just a joy! We'll be back...!"}
{"text":"Everytime we come here we have a problem,  ask for no onions get onions.  Get a soda, never get it refilled even when a manger walks by they still don't refill it.  We still keep coming because we are so close but sure wish the service would improve.  We ordered our favorite messy Sunday and the walnuts were stale ruined the whole Sunday :(. Now we have waited on our bill for so long that I have lowered my review from a 3 to 2 :((

I got an email from Sammy's saying they were going to try and work on items and that meant a lot to me so I am going to give them another try."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places. Everything on the menu is delicious, the girls in the gaming tavern are all AMAZING. One of my favorite things is how fresh the food is. Tons of vegetarian options, if you like Mediterranean food at all you MUST try the Mediterranean sampler (only 6$ on happy hour)...oh and did I mention how amazing the happy is? My go to neighborhood gaming bar, awesome food, awesome service. It doesn't eat any better."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Food and service is always topnotch. I especially love the new kale salad from the Mediterranean menu."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving 1 star is because we did have a pretty good waitress named Sandra Lynn.  The food was horrible."}
{"text":"Oh me oh my! Delicious. Went to this restaurant and this location for the first time about two weeks ago and I am beyond pleased. They have Gluten-Free and Vegan options. Oh AND they use natural and organic products when possible. Absolutely amazing. I have had their Gluten Free Vegan Pasta and their pizza and oh my goodness, mouth watering good. The manager Dina is such a delight. There was a teeny issue with my order ( nothing to get upset about) and she immediately fixed it without asking me. I was beyond surprised and pleased. Been there twice since and both waiters were fabulous. The most important thing for me is the service then the food because I can not enjoy my food with eeky service. The service A+ and the food A+. The patio area is such a nice place to sit at night when the weather is nice. They also offer Herbal Teas that my taste buds truly appreciate. Yum, Go visit. Great place!"}
{"text":"Don't do it in the morning. The staff is slow, confused, and rude. The hostess has to carry the older waitress who is walking around in a daze of forgetfulness. When she does emerge from the fog she is beyond rude. Customer service is not in her wheelhouse. The check has the servers name as Valerie. P.S. to management when your waitress tells your customer that she is the only one, that she is overworked and this is the \"norm\" it's time to hire additional staff. 
Eggs over cooked, dry, Hard old meat and burnt toast! 
Save the money and eat at Burger King."}
{"text":"Very good pizza , very good staff ,  . Goat cheese was to die for . Bartender was great . People are retarded When they have given this place such low ratings . Wow"}
{"text":"Great place to sit with girlfriends at the bar, have a glass of wine and maybe a pizza!  Pleasant atmosphere and nice staff!  They will fix your meal any way you want it, or even design your own meal.  They are great."}
{"text":"Perfect place for lunch! The service was fast and it wasn't super busy on a Friday afternoon. They have booths, tables, bar seating and a few tables outside! I was in town and wanted pizza so I decided to give Sammy's a try.

I got the BBQ chicken pizza and it was amazing. The crust was crisp but not burnt and the cheese was melted perfectly. The pizza was big for one person so if you're looking for something lighter I would split it. I also ordered coffee and normally I need lots of cream and sugar for my taste but the coffee alone was actually good! 

P.S. if you check in you get a messy sundae.. which really is messy"}
{"text":"Every person working had a scowl.  Took 27 minutes for our server to take our orders. I actually waved to one of the other servers to get her attention and she ignored me. Lighting is bad - bright beaming spotlight over the tables which was sticky along with the menu. And to add to the ambiance, there was a distinct burning smell coming from the kitchen. Food just ok, nothing that will make me want to return."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for locals in Vegas, affordable and everything we've ordered there has been tasty.

I recommend the large salads to share as a group (have tried tons and all are good), as well as the fancier pizzas. Recently had the one with brie and it was delish.

Service is quick and friendly and drinks are always refilled. Every time I visit family in Vegas we find ourselves at Sammy's, and never disappointed!"}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas, I really wanted to find some Gluten free pizza. I found Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill and went at there twice in one week! Their gluten free menu is large and the best thing for me, was that not only did they have gluten free pizza that tasted great- they had vegan cheese that was delicious. Usually, if I'm lucky enough to find a place that has gluten free pizza, I just order it without the cheese, but the vegan cheese was this icing on the cake,so to speak. The only negative thing we found was that on our second visit, we ordered the Arugula and Beet salad. The beets were canned- the salad was good, but would have been much better with fresh roasted beets. I plan to visit Sammy's in CA too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years since I worked at my second real estate office, C-21 MW, 2000-ish, (which used to be located nearby)- how come it's taken me so long to write a review?!

Our most recent visit was a few weeks ago, when we used my promotional Birthday Gift, the iconic Messy Sundae (ooey-gooey caramel and fudge topped vanilla ice cream with walnuts and whipped topping; it's one of my fave desserts of all time---yeah, it's that good). It was a saturday and was way before the lunch rush. So, it was quiet, until the large family who kept asking for \"gluten-free\" this & that arrived (Oh, I'm sure that their server was annoyed. Ok, maybe they weren't as annoying as the family who complained about the salads being \"way too big\" and thus their bill was adjusted, ahem; that was on another past visit). We got a different pizza this time (we've tried five different ones total, over the years), and had the truffle fries (to-die-for romano cheese-topped goodness). Our son loved the fries. He's kind of a picky eater, meaning, he won't eat it if he doesn't like it, picky. 
 
Service is always good. The bathroom is always clean. The rest of the restaurant grounds/main dining area, is always clean. If you can brave it, it's cold right now, there is seating outside, in the front. There is a bar part, too (separate---and yes, you guessed it, I've been to that part, too, years ago, though). And Happy Hour too. The food is solid--- from the pizzas, and must mention that the mini kobe beef burgers are really yummy, too. The salads are really good, too (I wouldn't be complaining about how big they are, either, hahaha).

It's christmas time, and there's a gift card promotion (Buy $50, Bonus $10 certificate), so why not get some christmas shopping done here, too? Grab a bite, try the kobe minis, along with a pizza, and get the messy sundae. Sounds like a plan. 

Also has a few other locations: centennial, flamingo (9516), rainbow/215, and green valley, too."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. I got a to go pepperoni pizza to take to the gate and eat before boarding. What I got was not good. Not for $15. It was frozen minor league stadium pizza or gas station pizza. Not a good wood fire style pizzeria style. Felt like a bait & switch."}
{"text":"I like to eat at this location, and I do  quite often I have noticed and a change in management and some change in servers ( and change is not always bad!) I  was there last night and i  have to say I have never really had an issue. The staff is usually always up beat and attentive  the restaurant is clean and the food is always good. I usually go in for happy hour where it is half off tapas i believe, Duck tacos, hummus and the flat bread are my favorites and not too long ago I recently went in for dinner with my family it was a bit busy but we were sat within seconds  and waited just a few minutes for our drinks which was fine once the drinks came we ordered our dinner family style : the  greek salad with chicken and a pepperoni pizza and the arugula pear pizza which was great and just enough for the four of us we ended up boxing up some of the leftovers. 

This place is great for a good healthy dinner/lunch/snack what have you,  whether its your date night  or if your with your family....  the staff here is always willing to accomidate in what ever you need  and there menu is great with their wide variety of healthy options ."}
{"text":"Ok, here's some straight up truth. I googled to find the best wood fired pizza in Vegas and was led here. Was it good, yes...was it the best in Vegas? I hope not. The toppings were good, the crust...hmmm...I prefer a lighter airy crispy crust. But everyone's different. The tapas were good, the service was ok. I would have given them a 3 star but now we come to the MESSY SUNDAE! That earned the 4th star! Save room n share!"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Sammy's for years. This location didn't disappoint us. Service and food were both great. We had the chopped chicken salad, Greek salad and tomato basil soup."}
{"text":"Ive seen these restaurants all over town and I've never had the urge to stop in. I had to go for a company event today and i was pleasantly surprised! Truffle fries were deliciously crispy. My favorite was dessert. Mini donuts with raspberry and chocolate sauce. The waitress didnt even charge me for my dessert because our company spent so much money and i told her id be leaving a good review. So she put it on the house. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why it has taken me so long to review Sammy's...it was my first favorite eatery in Las Vegas and still ranks in the top 5. I know its a chain, but its regional, and has some history in Las Vegas. This is one of the few places we take out of towners, and one of the few places where my family of very picky eaters can all get something they like. My top 3 favorite things about Sammy's are: 1) The pizza...everyone I get is great but the Margarita pizza is my fave. 2) The tapas...I judge all other edamame by  Sammy's standards. I also love their mac & cheese. 3) Salads...they have beautiful and delicious salads. Additionally, I've never had bad service (at this location or the Sunset location) and I like that the menu's differ by location. I didn't realize this until we hit the Sunset location with my brother (a creature of habit) and they didn't have his favorite dish from the W. Sahara location. Enough rambling...I am glad I live on the West side of town now, as this is my favorite location of the bunch, and it was the first in Vegas..."}
{"text":"We were excited to have a salad and pizza for dinner and we were  quite disappointed in  the food quality  and service . 

Sammy's does not offer Sweet & Low or Equal  as sweeteners , just Splenda and Stevia, both of which I cannot tolerate . So I had to send my iced tea back :(


The Cesar salad took 30 mins to arrive  and it was THE WORST Cesar we ever had ...Drowned in an awful dressing ( way too much of something) , limp lettuce , croutons that could break your teeth , and served on a non chilled plate ...We barely ate a few bites.

Our pizza was served literally 2 minutes after our salad so we had to send it back . We waited 15 mins before someone had the thought to bring it back to our table  . Oh, we added peppers to our NY pizza   and were charged a $1 for 6 juliiene strips , SERIOUSLY!!!
And the pizza was COLD when it was returned to us .

Do not even get me started on the lousy waiter !!!

I used to like Sammy's Woodfired Pizza but it would take a miracle to get us to return anytime soon"}
{"text":"For airport food, (if that is a legit way to describe this place) I was impressed. I had the mahi tacos and they were super good, filling, fresh. Also they have a great variety of pizzas (cooked in a brick oven), veg items, salads, tacos and beer/wine. This place hit the spot after a long flight. Only thing I didn't like was the hard, old French fries with my tacos..bummer."}
{"text":"Date night! We love Grimaldi's, but also love trying new things. 

I wouldn't come back here for the pizza- it was okay but not great. We got the New York Style pizza. Good size for 2 people, not too big. The crust was so thin I had to eat it with a fork and knife. The toppings and sauce had good flavor. 

We got the mini duck tacos for an appetizer, and those were delicious! The menu was interesting. It listed the appetizers as \"tapas,\" and included several Asian dishes. 

As first timers at Sammy's we were given a complimentary sundae- which was AMAZING. 

Really good service. We would love to come back for more duck tacos!"}
{"text":"The food here is just meh. It's okay for airport food--fine for one meal. We ordered the New York Style Pizza and the Soft Cheese Flatbread and both were expectedly mediocre. The cheese was a bit sour and the flatbread was too chewy and overly seasoned, but not terrible. The pizza was better, but then again, it's pizza. Not a bad stop to make if you find yourself in Terminal D (especially considering the other options), but don't expect much!"}
{"text":"I love this place for so many reasons! They do all of the things you expect from a restaurant on a superb level.

The service at this location is amazing. I had been to other Sammy's locations and received lackluster service but this location is so consistently on top of things that I have added them to my list of regular haunts.

The food is great, pretty much what you would expect from Sammy's but it is the friendly, attentive staff that sets them apart from their other restaurants."}
{"text":"Sammy's is MY PLACE. Always get the duck tacos. I have strayed from their AMAZING pizzas as of late because their salads ROCK! Plus, you can NEVER go wrong with their white whine special of the day. Always crisp, tasty and refreshing."}
{"text":"The food and service  was amazing, and the manager was very friendly,she came to our table to check on us and she was all over the place sending food etc our waiters  name was Stephen he was very attentive and knowledgeable  our drinks were always full. We definitely recommend this place and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The room and the vibe wasn't bad but I came in for lunch and there were about 10 people in the room. I got the chicken fettucine at lunch and it was gummy. Boo

They did remake the plate. Hope it's better.

So upon receiving the remade pasta plate, both the waitress AND I were surprised at the amazing improvement there was. Which had me beg the question: if you knew that the actual dish should (and could) look like what we ended up with,, why on earth would you even send that sub-par  plate of food.
 Makes me a little nervous about this place.

I do, however, like the little outdoor vibe for drinks, so my recommendation is, if you wanna go with some friends after work for a quick after work drink, it might be cute for a bit, but if you want food...it may be good, but it may not be.
Apparently the quality control is a bit iffy."}
{"text":"I'm from Sacramento here visiting and I could not be happier with the service I got tonight! I have food sensitivities and I ordered DoorDash and called ahead to make sure my order was received (because of my sensitivities I have to always be proactive just in case). Very professional and assuring service over the phone. Thank you so much (: my order was perfect! And very tasty."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some light fare since my Vegas trip mostly consisted of an all-you-can-eat smorgasbord.  This place was close by to the cuzzo's, and I had eaten here before.  We seemed to be in a goat cheese state of mind because we ordered the beet salad (with goat cheese), a small grilled shrimp salad with feta, and a goat cheese pizza with sauteed mushrooms.

They were all tasty and the portions were decent.  Not amazing fare, but satisfying.  Service was friendly although a bit too slow considering that it wasn't during a peak hour."}
{"text":"This particular Sammy's always seems full of people. Our server was very helpful in explaining the menu items and even went out of her way to ask if the kitchen could make an item that was no longer on the menu (hummus with kobe beef, served with lettuce cups). We also ordered a gluten-free garlic shrimp pizza and the messy sundae for dessert.

I was sharing the pizza with my friend, and he is not a fan of green peppers which came on the pizza. We asked if they could be omitted, our server went to the kitchen to ask. When she came back, she said that the pizza toppings for this particular one were \"premixed\" and could not be changed. That was a little disappointing to hear. What else is \"premixed\" here? But we ordered the pizza anyways and picked off the green peppers. As as far as gluten free pizzas go, it was alright. The garlicky flavor went very well with crust.

I do like that they serve iced tea in pitchers. I drink through that stuff like nothing."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good!  The variety is nice.  The salads are so so and the customer service is just ok.  Didn't like how they asked if I wanted olives and tomatoes in the salad then charged me $1 after the fact. The way they asked was as if they were already in the salad.  I really enjoyed the pizza and with the 2 for 1 coupons I have, it is worth four stars!"}
{"text":"The worst pie and customer service ever. 1 star cause I can't go any lower. This place closes at 10pm. Arrived at 9:41pm for a take out. The Hispanic looking cook not only gave me a nasty look for coming in late but made the worst pizza ever, not worth the $27 charged. Called the restaurant the following day and explained to the manager about my experience, but he also couldn't care less about it, being sarcastic and rude, just asking me what I'd want from him. Overpriced with mediocre food and giant ego joint. Never...ever."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. Pizza was kinda bland. I had the pepperoni pizza and I had to douse it with ranch dressing... But the service was awesome... lol"}
{"text":"I've been craving the Shrimp Angels Hair pasta for months. The small portion Arugula Salad was good for 4 people. Food is tasty and have a fairly good portion. Price is  reasonable. Too bad I think most people are eating in Downtown Summerlin nowadays. Come patronize the place."}
{"text":"Honestly the first time I went there my salad was amazing but the past few times the foods been mediocre! Burnt or not hot, my fiancee got sick after one occasion and the services is just not up to par. Stop flaunting your goods and bring me my food."}
{"text":"This is a fave place for our daughters. They are always well treated by the staff and there is something both of them like to eat on the menu.  It is also next to a yogurt shop which sweetens the deal."}
{"text":"Always love grabbing a bite to eat at Sammy's for lunch. Quick, friendly and the food is always good!! Thanks for taking great care of us Alysa!!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour at  4-6pm daily-Tapas, Beer and Wine menus at half-price. 

I LOVE the Baba Ghanoush w/grilled pita bread #nom!!

Pizza is only so-so but the macaroni & cheese is GREATTTT!!!

Also sign up on their website for the TASTY BYTES and get a FREE Pizza and lots of special offers."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place.  I came here because of the constant ads ive seen working out at lvac. I have to say there was nothing wrong with my experience  at Sammys. We sat in the patio area on halloween night. We were a little concerned that on a Friday night they werent that busy, but in the end it served beneficial to us because we were able to enjoy a lovely evening without a packed crowd. Also the weather that night was gorgeous which helped out the already wonderful ambiance.....i especially loved the fire pit outside. The food was great.....we ordered the dip trio...hummus, baba ganoush and some fresh milk cheese topped with cumin. It was very good, the fresh baked flat bread was nice. We also ordered the NY style pizza which was delicious.... the service was great and the dishes came out with perfect timing. For dessert we orderd the messy sundae which was good as well, good quality ice cream. And to top it off i got a 20% discount for being an lvac member. I will definitely visit this establishment again...good food at great prices and excellent service....good job!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good atmosphere.  Inside or outside seating option is good.

Small portions sizes, high price, compared to most pizza establishments.  Taste is average.

They ran out of a gluten free menu item when we were there, so my wife got a menu option she did not prefer."}
{"text":"Amazing Bartenders!! KAT and TAYLOR make you feel welcomed!!! great duck tacos, great organic kale salad, great pear argula pizza, great five cheese pizza..love everything!! i come here about 2 a week.. I really recommend it."}
{"text":"Great service...had a birthday party and they were very accommodating! Happy hour 3 - 6pm. Food is excellent...order duck tacos tapas!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in this little pizza restaurant. I wouldn't expect 5 star quality from an airport restaurant but I did expect the pizza to be a little better.

The service was slow and the pizza was mediocre. If you're looking for a quick bite before a flight, I wouldn't recommend here."}
{"text":"happy hour: Chicken Satay, lobster mac/cheese & small pizza (NY style). Had two Cabernets & a blue moon:: cab was about 4 sips! Bottle of beer.. Was not worth $50.00 . Pizza was so greasy we used a napkin to try to take some off. Happy hour prices were not worth the trip .. Will not stop by again. Better places in Vegas for happy hour drinks & food prices.. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Best experience in airport dining in a long time.  Very accommodating to vegans, friendly service, hummus was tasty."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. I don't go as often as I'd like to but when I can I always always always, get the lobster bisque with honestly any of their wood fired pizzas. It's good every time. Today I decided to skip the pizza (had some for dinner last night) and ordered the Mediterranean sampler plate on the appetizer list. Warm slices of pita bread with 3 choices of dip. Lebni, hummus and Baba ghanoush. If you're a fan of Mediterranean food you will love this plate. I have to admit that is way better than Paymons Mediterranean. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was pressed for time as my boarding was about 45 minutes forward and much to my surprise unlike most places in the airport where we can simply sit down it was much more formal and the hostess had to seat you. About 10 minutes past as I watch the hostess and server socializing with each other so finally after about 10 to 15 minutes we decided to get up and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"We like to go here for Tapas happy hour!  Fun little plates of deliciousness that are great for sharing.

It's a good family place and our picky eater can always order pizza (there's a kid's menu).  

Service is usually pretty good."}
{"text":"I love this place! Truffle pizza, lobstar mac and cheese, and duck tacos. The three things needed after a long day of work. Sign me up anytime and everytime....:)"}
{"text":"Shrimp fettuccini was good. Cesar salad was good. Didn't try any pizza. Maybe I'll try it Next time! Quick service. Very nice waitress."}
{"text":"Is it weird I've been to Sammy's a handful of times and only once I've ordered the pizza? Probably not considering their menu boasts a great many other tasty items.
This location out in the boonies (according to me and where I am located) is tucked away at the far end of a shopping center. My GPS kept telling me we had made it, when in reality, we were still in front of Lowe's. 

The restaurant itself is on the small side, and when it fills up, gets a bit loud. Not to say you can't hear your dining companions, but loud none the less. I selected this location for a meeting with a client and I am happy to say it delivered with food, service, and ambiance.

For starters we all shared the crab and shrimp dip, which came out piping and steaming hot. Creamy and not overly-salted (a fault I find often with crab/shrimp dip) this dip paired well with a plentiful amount of delicately seasoned pita bread slices. Thank you Sammy's for bringing out plenty of pita bread for three girls to share. We actually did not end up finishing the pita bread and I was able to take it home and pair with my hummus later in the evening.

For my entrée I selected the grilled Hawaiian ONO tacos that come with your choice of flour or corn tortillas and also your choice of a side, of which I chose French fries. The fries were \"eh\" nothing special, but the tacos were nice LARGE portions with plenty of big, flaky white fish. The tomato-avocado salsa was over flowing out of my tacos and all was rounded out with a bit of heat from the creamy Chipotle sauce.

Drinks were consistently refilled, plates were removed quickly, and the bill arrived in a timely manner. If I were to host my client again in this area, I would certainly pick Sammy's to be the place to do it."}
{"text":"Duck tacos. Duck tacos. Duck tacos.

I know, it's a pizza place, but duck tacos are the only thing I order when I come here. I find Sammy's to be hit or miss most of the time. Besides this location I have also been to the one on Sahara once. However, I spent a birthday dinner at this location in Henderson a couple years ago.

Besides the duck tacos (I know I just confessed to only eating them) I have also had their pizzas. Well, of course I had to considering the place has \"pizza\" in its name. But alas, I have always come back to the duck tacos. I've never had them and not loved them.

Service is typically decent. I've never run into a down-right rude server, but some have been kind of stand-offish. 

The place can turn into quite a family magnet during certain times of the day or on weekends. I usually go during off-hours when it's not as busy and I won't be bothered by large crowds."}
{"text":"I ate here last Saturday for my friends birthday. She had a group of 20 adults and like 6 kids all between the ages of 2-8. I have to say that our server, I believe her name is Jennifer did an amazing job! I've waited on tables before and I can't imagine handling a big party with kids running around and keeping it as professional and calm as she did. Even though the kids were at times loud and all over the place she waited on us so well and didn't show the frustration I know she must have felt specially when her and the sections  around her were not getting seated. I also appreciate the servers around her that were affected by a big party keeping costumes away. I know my friend had a great time because of the the amazing food and service. Thank you Jennifer for being so great at your job."}
{"text":"My vegen buddy claims this place is good for his \"veganess\". 
Tasty!.  Dinner here tonight was very good.  Megan provided excellent service and was a pleasure to deal with.  Thai pizza, no longer on the menu, was still available and was delicious.  The Mediterranean appetizer was excellent, the asparagus with balsamic and almonds was outstanding, and the portions were generous.  Great food, the only beef is that they were out of several beers due to being in the process of moving.  Sometimes the garlic at Sammy's can be overwhelming, but tonight it was just fine!  Excellent dining for the whole family, reasonably priced (a bit higher than a typical family joint, tho) and a cool place to kick it with friends."}
{"text":"While I've reviewed several other Sammy's locations in the Valley, I've never written one for this one, though we've eaten here before.  The occasion tonight was for a \"milestone\" birthday party for a friend, and we were able to order whatever we wanted. 

There were about 16 of us, and we were seated at two adjacent tables.  If that was the restaurant's decision, I applaud it, since it broke up that awful big-party long table that has some people invariably stuck, with no way to exit.  We had just one server who worked her butt off, but never once lost her cool or made us wait for anything.  I wish I knew her name, but never did get it.  

Since this dinner party was called for 5:00 pm, which for us is really a late lunch (!), we weren't all that hungry.  Besides, we had an Oscar party to go to later, and expected to be able to nosh there, too.  So hubby and I shared the Mini Duck Taco appetizer, which is fantastic, and our mainstay Thai Chicken Salad.  The salad seemed bigger than usual, and was its customary delicious combination of romaine, shredded zucchini, chopped tomatoes, peanuts, and other goodies, complemented by a slightly spicy dressing that we get on the side.  We had enough left over to share as a side salad the next night.  My one complaint was that the chicken was overcooked and way too dry, but overall, this is a winning dish that we order over and over again.

All in all, this Sammy's is not unlike all the other Sammy's, and the terrific service made for a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This time I strayed away from my usual Hummus and Thai Salad. Those items are both delicious but I figured it was called Sammy's Woodfired Pizza for a reason. I can't let all this time pass and not try the pizza right? 

The pizza here isn't huge... they are a little bigger than a personal pan pizza at Pizza Hut. Sammy's gives you some healthy options for the crust you can either get wheat crust for a dollar more or gluten free for I think $3.00 dollars more. I opted for the wheat crust because I'm not sure what health benefits gluten free would have on me. I'm not used to making healthy choices but I try...sometimes. I was afraid the crust would be hard and stale but it was very fresh and fluffy inside. My topping for my order was Mozzarella with fresh basil. The cheese was nice and gooey like gum which in my book is a good thing! 

It was a chilly day so I also ordered a bowl of Lobster Bisque soup. This is my first time having it and I was happy that it had a creamy texture. There were little bits of lobster in it and it didn't leave a weird after taste in my mouth. It was pretty tasty! 

My husband and I shared the Warm Crispy Donuts which were served with a side of chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce. They melted in your mouth especially with the addicting dipping sauces!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this restaurant for the first time tonight, with my parents and my six year old daughter. Our server, Brandon, was one of the best servers we've ever had, anywhere! The service was so good that even if the food had been lackluster (which it definitely was not) we'd chalk it up to a bad night and give it another shot.

We had an Asian chicken salad and a New York pizza. The salad was absolutely delicious, with a slightly spicy dressing that was very flavorful. The pizza, which we ordered on wheat crust, had mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni, and the sauce was terrific!

My parents shared a Hawaiian pizza that wasn't terrific, but as I'm not a huge fan of Hawaiian pizza, I may not be the best judge. They also got a pepperoni pizza to go, and I peeked into the box... and almost tried to sneak out with it! It looked and smelled FANTASTIC.

We will definitely be back to Sammy's. My only complaint is that we didn't discover them sooner."}
{"text":"Having a good lunch today.  Food was great as always.  But if you want bread and/or crackers, you better ask early.   And ask often.  Each offering is 3 pieces.  Service was ok today.  Usually better and the reason for the discounted review."}
{"text":"Sammy's Wood Fire Pizza, great place for pizza, they have toppings you would never think to put on a pizza, and they work.  Must be the way they cook their pizza that gives it a special different but good different taste.  what i will always remember this place for, is their ceasars dressing.  very very good.  i compare everyone elses ceasar dressing to Sammy's dressing."}
{"text":"I had the vegeteble pizza with Daiya (non-dairy) cheese, and it was amazing! Perfect combination of flavors and textures. Their pizza crust is to die for."}
{"text":"Very yummy! Good selection. Lots of variety for diet restrictions: gluten free, vegan, vegetarian etc. Ok service- our waiter was friendly, we were the only ones in there and it took 30 minutes for a water refill. Will be back bc the selection/ingredients and flavors and prices are awesome."}
{"text":"The purpose of 2 stars for this location is NOT because of the food or our waiter, it is because the manager has Very Poor Management/leadership skills.  She decided to have several LENGTHY conversations with our server in the kitchen instead of letting him do his job and take care of his customers.

Our drinks sat empty for a very long period, wine that was ordered never came without having to ask for the status of what we ordered, other things we needed were never addressed and again it was not the waiters fault but the manager who would not let him do his job.

Not only did she ignore all the customers in the restaurant which she had a clear view of, she held three people up from doing their jobs and never asked anyone else to cover.  All our waiter could do was apologize for the long wait on food & drink.  

This was not his fault and the manager should be apologizing.  We were there for my mom's 81st bday and it was just horrible service thanks solely to the manager.  Needless to say even though this location is closers to my mom, we will NOT be back to this location again.  Green Valley is closer to our house and I will go pick my mom up, bring her to the GV location & take her back to Summerlin for a better environment, service & overall management.  Very disappointed with this manager making my mom's 81st bday a bad experience."}

{"text":"We came here for a fundraiser for our school. The pizzas are pretty small and bland. the salads are forgettable also."}
{"text":"Met up with a high school friend who now resides in Nevada.  We had just finished a tour of Hoover Dam (because we're nerds) and decided on grabbing dinner in Henderson somewhere.  So we were left with Sammy's Woodfired Pizza.  I don't know how this came to be the only choice.  But seeing as to how I've never had it before, I was a go.

Had the LaDou's BBQ Chicken pizza.  Not bad at all.  In fact, I finished the whole pizza minus one and minus the crust.  I think I may need to give this place a second try in California."}
{"text":"Staff is nice, place is clean, food is yummy.  Nothing entirely special or stand out about it but delicious none the less."}
{"text":"I truly appreciated a manager reaching out to me after reading my Yelp review. Wow, isn't that what Yelp is for! Yet I commend Sammy's and their manager Karissa for taking the time to listen & respond to its customers when they didn't have to. Thank you so much, Karissa.

We returned to this location, and the pear & arugula pizza was delicious again & perfect this time. The gluten free crust was the best my partner said he's ever had. Everyone enjoyed the ducks tacos. It was my partner's daughter's birthday, and we all loved the gigantic ice cream sundae. The sundae was something I wouldn't normally order as an adult lol, but omg it was goood.

Our server was delightful; she really went the extra mile. From recommending an Arnold Palmer (his daughter's first, which she loved), to carrying her birthday candle to the side so the wind wouldn't blow it out before she could, to just being genuinely cheerful, she and the manager on duty provided exceptional service. 

It was beautiful sitting in the outside booths on a sunny day. I think this is a great lunch spot, a little oasis in the middle of the city. And after feeling valued as a customer, they've got my loyalty. Thank you again, Sammy's, Karissa, the manager on duty that day, & to all of the servers!"}
{"text":"This place has healthy options (which I love ), their presentation is artwork, and the ambiance is charming. I recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love Sammy's but kinda disappointed that they changed their happy hour menu from all tapas to a select amount with limited pieces. My family and I enjoy the duck tacos, truffle fries, and lobster mac n cheese but now lobster mac n cheese is gone from happy hour and duck tacos is only two pieces. I'll still come back and enjoy my meal with family and friends just maybe expand my horizons away from the tapas menu."}
{"text":"I'm kinda upset the last time I went their happy hour menu changed! Some of my favorites are still on the menu but the prices changed and the quantity changed. I used to take everyone here for happy hour and now I don't go at all because they changed it."}
{"text":"Lunchtime crowd and we were seated right away. That's when we were \"forgotten\" ! It took longer then it should for the server to get back and get us our drinks. Even longer to take our order and I mentioned it to the server. Next thing is we're bring served by entirely different server. Which took even more time. I didn't like the way we were served and the menu was weak. I'm not going back ..,."}
{"text":"I've been to all four locations at Sahara, 2-15, Flamingo, and Green Valley.  Never got bad service at any of them.  They do tend to get really swamped during lunch time at the Sahara and Flamingo location by businessmen.  They have amazing happy hour pricing between 3pm- 6pm.  

I'm just gonna lay out a list of good tapas there.  The mini duck tacos,  the coconut shrimp skewers, chicken lettuce cups, mac & cheese, and the hummus is yum!

My favorite pizza is the truffle & brie pizza.  It's crispy, thin crusted, layered with melted brie cheese and mushrooms and truffle oil.  It's a nice change in taste compared to the usual mozarella cheeses used in pizza.  I added prociutto to it sometimes if I'm feeling a little carnivorous. 

The salads are always ice cold and fresh.  You can't go wrong with the Caesar Salad served with grilled chicken breast.  The romaine lettuce is always ice cold all the times I've had it, and its's served with dressing is savory & tangy.  The Chilled Roasted Vegatable Salad is definitely is my favorite guilt-free salad.  It has edamame, tomatoes, mozarella pearls, spinach, drizzled with olive oil and balsalmic vinegar. 

If you haven't tried this place out...you're missing out."}
{"text":"Stopped in last week for the 1st time, and was very pleasantly surprised.  The food was great and the ambiance was very enjoyable, and  the service was amazing. Our server Taylor was amazing, she was very nice and courteous and also very knowledgeable of the menu and made great suggestions. Will definitely be returning and requesting Taylor!"}
{"text":"If it isn't broken...break it!

     This used to be a place where me and my girlfriend would go 3-4 times a week but in the past several weeks they've mutilated it (I meant renovated). The vintage Thomas Edison fixture is outdated and the booths were once smooth and comfortable. Now they're fabric which is a huge business mistake since kids will destroy them in months to come. Where are the bar stools? How do I watch football!? What a waste of money. Put the funding into marketing rather than taking the restaurant backwards into the 70's. Come on Sammy! Why ruin a good thing? You have 25 other locations. I know you're a smart guy but whoever hired your interior designer needs a reality check. You should've hired Gordon Ramsay or Jon Taffer, not David Bromstad from HGTV. The color scheme is dull and boring. Might as well change the name to \"Sammy's Woodfired Funhouse.\" I didn't know this would be the new set for the upcoming Smurfs movie. How does this bring in revenue? How does this put people in the booths (well, you took the one out where we used to sit so it doesn't matter. We'll sit on the newly built countertop instead; bad business decision). Fix the water spot in the ceiling above the thermostat first, then worry about the ridiculous phony flower boxes with LED lighting that serve no purpose. And the new TV's? They were installed a bit slanted. But that's not important because who watches TV, right?

Other than the food and the staff, we won't be going back. The employees always make us feel special. They're attentive, hardworking, fun, and professional. We've never had a horrible meal. The duck tacos are the best.  I've been in Vegas since 1990, and the Sahara location was my place for business meetings and this location was for the family. But seeing where Sammy is going with it, I'm going somewhere else. Check please!

02/04/2015

We walked into this place today and wow. It was a jungle in there. The place is closed for several days until they destroy more of what was already nice. Green jungle wallpaper on some of the walls? At least they're sticking to the theme. Horrible."}
{"text":"I finally tried out this chain last night.  We ordered the Crab, Shrimp and Artichoke Dip and also the Sun-Dried Tomato pizza.  Both were very good, but as far as pizza goes, it wasn't absolutely amazing i.e. I've had better.  I do like that they aren't too pricey.  I have no objection to a return visit."}
{"text":"It's not often that I write a negative review. I usually try to find the positives and give a place at least an A-OK. I can't really do that for this Sammy's, unfortunately.

First, the good. I enjoyed the lobster bisque. It had nice chunks of lobster in it, was served at a nice just-barely-too-hot temperature (i.e. room to cool down), and it was creamy and delicious.

That was really the only enjoyable part of the meal. We also ordered a garlic shrimp pizza and a balsamic chicken salad. I couldn't really taste much garlic in the pizza. Actually, the pizza overall was just blah. While it wasn't terrible, it certainly didn't match up with pizza I've had previously at other Sammy's. Perhaps the fact that I was at Grimaldi's just a few days ago didn't help things. Grimaldi's owns Sammy's any day of the week.

As for the chicken salad, it was a huge portion, but it just seemed like it was drenched in that vinaigrette. I couldn't eat much of it before I had to stop. Although we had a lot of salad left over, neither of us wanted to take any of it to go. Strangely enough, the server didn't even ask if we wanted it to go. (Not complaining!)

Speaking of the wait staff, our server was nice enough, but upon entering, it took a while before there was anyone to greet us. We weren't sure if we should just seat ourselves. That's just a minor thing, but when the overall dining experience is sub-par, things like that just stick out.

Walking into Sammy's, I hadn't eaten all day and was starving. Walking out, I was no longer hungry, but I wasn't satisfied either. It's a shame because I remember enjoying the food at the CMYE a few months ago."}
{"text":"Big fan of Sammy's salads. I've been coming here for years. The food has adjusted slightly but still delicious. I like the good ingredients and delicious taste. I even enjoy all the locations!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had a great experience. We were immediately greeted upon walking in the door, and seated in a booth as requested. Our waiter was great, he has been our waiter on multiple occasions. He moved the table at the booth so I could place the car seat with my daughter in it down. 

We like ordering a bunch of tapas and sharing. We had the Parmesan Crusted Artichokes, Pork Dumplings, Baba Ghanoush, Wok'd Sesame Shishito Peppers, and Garlic Cheese Bread. 

All of the food was fantastic, the Parmesan Crusted Artichokes are a must if you have never tried them. The Pork Dumplings are great and the Ponzu chili dipping sauce they come with is absolutely incredible. I would also recommend the Wok'd Sesame Shishito Peppers if you want something different. Very light, with a lot of flavor. 

The Garlic Cheese Bread is absolutely heavenly!! Bottom line is you have to try Sammy's, and this is the best location in town."}
{"text":"The regional manager for Sammy's Woodfire Pizza contacted me based upon the unpleasant experience I had. I can proudly say she went out of her way to correct the problems that occurred and make it up to me. I was really impressed at the dedication to improving the customer experience. It is rare to see that these days, thank you!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new so we tried this place and it was fabulous.. My boyfriend and I had the greek salad along with the New York style pizza... Highly recommended... The service and staff were excellent..."}
{"text":"Great gluten-free meal options! I ordered the Greek Salad with 1/2 of a chicken breast and it was a generous size. I just found out they also deliver, which is awesome because they are right down the street from where I work. 

The prices are a bit high, but the meal size was so generous that I had leftovers for another meal. My coworkers and I sat on the patio on a hot day and the shade makes it bearable. The service was quick and the server was really nice. 

Great place to go for a sit-down lunch with a group of friends, as there are options for everyone across the board."}
{"text":"Food was amazing love the barbecue Pizza. But as a business owner myself when people are talking poorly about their employer I feel terrible. We had a server name Marnie and all she did was complain about the policies that they had as well as how often they changed the menu I can order off of any menu as long as I have good service. Food was great and adup finding something amazing just wish we had somebody that made life a little bit more positive"}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour! All their Shareables are half off! The duck tacos are amazing! They also have this Mediterranean Dip Sampler that lets you try a little bit of Hummus, Baba Ganoush, and Lebni Cheese with flat bread! So good! Service is fast and the staff is always so welcoming. Will definitely be back over and over again!!!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do, don't eat the food. My daughter had the quesadilla and got food poisoning. She's throwing up like no tomorrow. I had the nachos, and even though I'm not throwing up, I feel sick to my stomach. I didn't eat the whole thing because it was awful!!! The chips were straight outta a bag and the cheese was that processed crap. Yuck!!!
Not only did the food taste crappy, the service was just as bad. This guy was terrible. He was lazy and stupid all in one. Fire this guy will ya! 
Sammy, you're restaurant is going down the tubes! (Btw, I've been here numerous times, and never again will I go back). Adios Sammy's!!!"}
{"text":"Went here friday night for dinner with hubby. We had not been here for a few years and we were excited to try it again. We wanted to love it... But found everything to be just ok... Kinda disappointing. Service was slow, even though it was not that busy (our first clue we 
Probably picked the wrong place to eat). The restaurant was very warm... I am always  old (even in las vega summers) but the first thing I asked the waitress aw to please have the ac turned down as I was sticking to my shirt after only a few minutes in my booth. She agreed that it was warm,but thought it was because she was working hard. It never cooled off much after our initial discussion. Oh well... Food was ok... Not great and not bad enough to send back. Grilled shrimp salad was soggy, over dressed ( forgot to ask for dressing on the side), soup was hot, weird oily creaminess. I did not like the leftover coating in my mouth so hubby ate this. Garlic bread was over greasy... Really it was a white pizza, not garlic bread like I thought. Bar far, the worst part of the meal was a salad that we took home for our daughter. We ordered the chopped sAlad to go. We did not bother to. Heck it before we left the restaurant (would never have occurred to me!). When she opened the sAlad, she thought we were playing a joke on her. There were 4 small cubes of chicken,6 small pieces of copped tomAto, a sprinkle of chopped black olives and about 4 cups of shredded lettuce!  We could not find anything else in this sAlad... She deconstructed everything, cut up her own tomAto, shredded some cheese, removed more than half of the shredded lettuce and had her dinner. Still An anemic salad, but when it's late Nd youRe hungry, what are you going to do? Horrible... There is no way they would have served this salad in the restaurant. I feel ripped off! I would have called to complain, but then they would probably offer to replace or give a coupon. No thanks, I have no desire to go back... Even for free meal!"}
{"text":"Not bad for vegan pizza, was hoping for more veggie options though! Music and lighting was nice! Service was friendly but I would have appreciated a heads up on the extra $$ for every single extra veggie! I think there are other pizza places that are better that don't up charge for everything! $2.50 extra for spinach!!! Do you see any spinach on there? Those green things are peppers, which I didn't ask for!!!"}
{"text":"While the vegetarian pizza is my absolute favorite, save room for a nutty, fudge sundae! yummmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Just in love with their pear arugula pizza. We get it every time we are there. I also get their balsamic chicken salad and I am glad they got individual sizes now.  Tomato basil soup and lobster bisque are crazy good too. I just need to try their chili. We can eat here everyday and eat the same pizza all the time. Maybe next time I'll try their pasta or just something new."}
{"text":"Having lunch again today at Sammy on Rainbow and 215. I always enjoy coming here because the staff are always very welcoming and kind. Gwen and Bee are awesome employees. The menu has a lot of healthy choices to choose from. The food is always fresh and delicious.
 Chef Polo is always very accommodating to my food requests and it's very appreciated. 
Thanks to all the staff at Sammy's for always taking good care of me.  I highly recommend Sammy's as one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Having lunch again at Sammy's on Sahara Avenue. I'm addicted to the salads. I've been having lunch and dinner at this location for over 20 years and it's my favorite restaurant. The staff and the managers especially karissa one of the best I've ever seen. The employees are always so courtesy and kind every time I walk through the door and it's very appreciated. Today I'm having the famous Greek salad. It's always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Sammy's in a while and I was bummed to learn that they no longer have lunch specials and apparently they have not for quite sone time. 

Visiting for lunch today the check quickly added up. You can easily spend 20.00 on lunch, getting a salad or pizza with a drink and tip. 

The server we had was very friendly and attentive. Food came out pretty quickly. The food I will say is good. Salads are made with fresh ingredients. Pizzas are served hot and fresh as well. The food is good, I don't know if I would say it's worth 20.00. 

20.00 for lunch is where I feel it is a bit pricey. 

With menu items being that expensive I don't think it's in the budget to visit Sammy's often."}
{"text":"the price is too high for the quality and taste.  I only went there because we had a coupon and none of my friends like it.  It's a wannabe CPK at best."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place.  Always consistent.  Happy hour is a Steal!!! This place has always been in my top five!!"}
{"text":"I must say I was happy for the most part with this place.  I had the Sun Dried tomato pizza which was an all around good pizza.  The service could of been better, but hey I've had worse.  The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars and not 4 is merely because of the food.  Don't get me wrong the food was great, but I think I can find better pizza.  I'll try my luck with some other pizza joints before coming back here though.  Definitely worth the try, next time I will have to try the tapas everyone seems to be raving about."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at the Sammy's in Palm Dessert CA sometimes and we needed to grab a quick bite to eat so we went with something that we knew. As always, we were not disappointed. She had the chopped salad and it was good and huge. I actually tried their pizza for the first time, and for wood oven pizza (not my favorite style) it was very good. A little pricey for its size...but very good. Great cheese, great sauce and good crust."}
{"text":"It was the first time my girlfriend & I have been to Sammy's. Upon entering there were two workers who repeatedly stared at us making eye contact from across rhe way near the open kitchen area. It was not busy at all maybe 5 other parties. We didn't know whether or not to seat ourselves so we just assumed we are supposed to. No one greeted us; they just stared at us- so we chose a booth. My girlfriend went to the restroom and one of the worker said to the server rudely \"we have sole self-seaters\" over there. Judging from her attire I'm assuming it was the manager or supervisor. After the waitress took our order another party came in and didn't hesitate to immediately walk up to them smiling and greeted/sat them. I thought that was extremely rude for her to stare at us and ignore us. Then say we have \"self-seaters\" over there and continue to ignore us. That was not a very good first impression for us. The food is good but we felt singled out."}
{"text":"Visited Sammy's for lunch.  We had the lobster bisque soup & the Goat cheese pizza. Both were excellent! The pizza was made with with fresh goat cheese, spinach, mozzarella cheese, red onion & garlic.  The crust was delicious and buttery.  Definitely will be returning to Sammy's soon!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was good.  However, they have a fruit fly problem that they need to solve.  I recommend a trap of equal parts beer, orange juice and apple cider vinegar.  Put it all in a cup, cover it with plastic wrap and secure it around the cup with a rubber band.  Poke a few holes and attract all the fruit flies away from my food (so I don't end up with a fruit fly in my lobster bisque next time)."}
{"text":"came with a group of 6  people and were pleasantly impressed by the food, decor and knowledge of our server. My appetizer was great. The asparagus was SO good. I tried my friend's chili and it was absolutely AMAZING!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food okay. But extremely slow. Be warned do not go here if in a hurry. I had time to kill so I was okay. But don't expect fast service
."}
{"text":"This Sammy's on Sahara is one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas, just exceptional consistent delicious food preparations. You can tell that the chefs put a lot of love in their dishes. Salads are heavenly, e.g. Greek Salad, Grilled Shrimp Salad, Caesar's Salad with e.g. a blackened Salmon (my favorite), and when you sit there you can tell that many guests order their salads. Their pizzas are a special delight of course.
We have a lot of restaurant choices here in Las Vegas, but we're at Sammy's at least a couple times per week. I've dinned at this place for well over 20 years. They also have a very refreshing brewed Tropical Iced Tea. We haven't tried everything on the menu, but everything we ate there over the many years has been superb, ... and there was never a disappointment. BTW, it's also a popular restaurant for business people as well as for families and a romantic dinner for couples."}
{"text":"Ambiance is good and the drink pours are great. I had the fig and Gorgonzola flat bread, which was an interesting taste but not something I would order again. However, the menu includes other great options and they look fantastic."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My man and I come here so often they know us by first name. I love the service, the ambiance, the food and the servers are kind people. 

Today we came in for a post Mother's Day celebration, our server Casey always sees us there but we had the honor of having him serve us. He is a very sweet guy 


UPDATE: so we basically go as often as possible however with this new addition my wine drinking has come to a sudden hault! We had to come back to enjoy the amazing tapas and see our other favorite server Albert! 


Items to definitely check out: Mediterranean sampler (we're not baba ghanoush people, so extra lebni cheese); lobster mac&cheese; thai chicken satays. 


Enjoy your meal!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sammy's a few times. It seems to have a great location that is a great in-between for people who live close to the strip and people who live in Summerlin. I find myself always full when I leave this place. The staff is extremely efficient. The last time I was there, my ice tea never got below 1/2 full. 

I always start with the Hummas! It is sooo yummy!!"}
{"text":"I am torn on how to review this Sammy's... Why? Not because my dinner wasn't terrific. It was. Sammy's Pizza & Grill is consistently impressing my tummy and the service is always GREAT! I normally visit the Sahara location and I love it so my expectations are set high.
 
So WHY am I torn on how to review it? I had an extremely+friendly+terrific server that seemed a little over-eager to wait on my boyfriend and I. I feel bad saying that, because he really was such a good waiter. Why was he over-eager? When he was taking our drink order, he looked at my iphone and sawI had checked in on Yelp. 

It made me slightly uncomfortable that he looked at my phone; what if I had was doing something private that I wasn't happy to share with my waiter?? He then mentioned his name so I could Yelp about him... And commented on making sure he gave us the best of everything 3/4 times... Shouldn't everyone get the best of everything everyday?? 

FOOD: 5 Stars! I love that you can get all of the wraps with lettuce instead of bread for a healthier option. My boyfriend had the wheat bbq chicken pizza and it was WONDERFUL! Our appetizer of the Satay chicken skewers were also very tasty. 
CLEANLINESS: 5 Stars. The decor in this location is nicer and the tables don't feel overly smushed together despite it being smaller than the other location. 
SERVICE: 4ish Stars: John was a great waiter. He is very outgoing, he brought out fresh ice for our water refills and he definitely isn't against going the extra mile for the guests. BUT he removed my boyfriends fork, said he would bring him another one and never came back... Kinda annoying because he wanted to eat. Also, it really ticked me off that he looked at my cell phone. He made a big deal about Yelp users, which was thoughtful... But I personally like using Yelp because it allows users to review the food/service on an everyday basis... Not on your best behavior.
THEY GO THE EXTRA MILE HERE: Because John saw me check in on my phone, he brought us a HUGE free Ice Cream sundae. Very thoughtful, but my boyfriend couldn't eat it because of his Blood Sugar level, hopefully they fed it to someone so it didn't go to waste. 
PRICE: $35 + $6 Tip=$41 for our pizza, wrap and appetizer. Worth it to us because the food is great and the service is consistently good. It is a step above Applebees price wise, but totally worth it. If you like Firefly, you will love this place! 

I am giving this place 5 stars based on the food and their friendly staff... But honestly I would suggest that the wait staff not make a habit of reading customers' phones. If they are eager for Yelpers to check-in maybe they could offer a check-in deal here for a half priced app or something? I certainly wouldn't be against another chicken Satay :)"}
{"text":"Really good pizza place my wife and I have eaten at five times. The Pizza Diavola and the Five Cheese pizzas are favorites of ours. My wife's favorite dish is actually an appetizer. It's hummus with ground kobe beef that has been seasoned with cinnamon. Sounds strange at first, but is delicious. Sometimes she orders it as her actual meal."}
{"text":"It's a shame about the experience I had this last time.

We wanted to go here after our hike, because we were pretty impressed by some of the food we had on our previous experiences here. They had a pot de creme was that was heavenly and a slider that was on point.

Since we had our dog with us, we decided to call and see if they let dogs eat on the patio.

Me: \"Excuse me, do you guys allow small dogs on your patio?\"
Sammy's Employee: \"Yes! Of course, it shouldn't be a problem.\"

Well it was a problem.

We arrived and was greeted not by someone asking if they could help us, but someone who wanted to tell us our dog was not allowed. And rather than having it be a conversation to get clarity on their policy (because after all we just called) -- he said that \"Sammy's was a restaurant and dogs weren't allowed to eat on the patio because it was a health violation.\"

Hmmm...

Well how does Lazy Dog Restaurant in Summerlin stay compliant? I saw enough dogs on their patio to merit a shelter.

Thanks, Sammy -- but no thanks. Am totally willing to abide by your policy (whatever you decide that it is) but not willing to be treated rudely or have wanting to get some food from your place be entirely inconvenient."}
{"text":"Love, love, love, the salads here!!  So fresh and healthy!  Everything is really tasty, they'll even accommodate you and make to order a vegan pizza!

Service is always terrific and atmosphere is relaxing!!!

Price is perfect...

It's my favorite Sunday hang out!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good pizza and great appetizers.  The staff was friendly and the place was clean.  I enjoyed the atmopshere."}
{"text":"It's what you expect - overpriced, underwhelming, mediocre airport food. Got a hummus grilled chicken wrap which didn't offer much in the way of freshness or flavor. Served with a side of cole slaw. The unsweet tea (which was almost $4) was watery. Only thing that avoided a 1 star was the server was nice, though the service wasn't particularly quick. Probably not the worst place in the airport, but you probably could save money and eat something better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Being new to the neighborhood we were delighted to discover a great pizza place.  We have ordered take out a few times and dined in once.  All the food and service has been great!"}
{"text":"We so love this place, the food, service, property, all of it has been top notch!"}
{"text":"Oh sammy!!!  Where do I start?

Great pizza, great kobe sliders, good edemame ....... wait...... oh... wait...is that the Lebna dish I see in the pic?  Oh yes it is.  That Lebna dish is the ish.  What the?!?!?!?!?!  And a big ball of cotton candy for desert?  Over, son!

Why only 4 stars? you might ask.  Well its because I'm always F**kin freezin my butt off cause they have the \"AirCon\" (for my flips)  on full blast.  Sit outside?  I don't think so."}
{"text":"Looking at the menu, it seems that Sammy's either can't decide what type of food they are serving, or they are trying to copy the popular dishes from a dozen different restaurants.

Tapas, Lettuce wraps, Tacos, Hummus? I thought this was a pizza joint, but there are mostly non-pizza items on the menu.

It's nice to see gluten free and dairy free pizza options on the menu, but they charge way too much for it here. The personal pizzas are around $13, but if you want GF/DF it will be $5 extra. Apparently Sammy's thinks people with allergies should pay 40% more than everyone else.

The gluten free crust is not made in house, it's a very thin premade crust. Worse, they don't even know how to fire it. My pizza was soggy in the center, it flopped over and the toppings fell off when I picked up a piece.  $18 for this small soggy pizza is steep, even if it is gluten and dairy free.

I make a far better gluten free pizza at home. Even Whole Foods can make a better gluten and dairy free pizza, at less than half the price of Sammy's.

A redeeming factor is the Daiya cheese, it's awesome and pretty much impossible to screw up. Even if you eat dairy you will probably love this stuff.

The waitress recommended \"Kobe\" beef sliders to my friend, and assured her that the fries were fresh cut when asked. The sliders tasted like average low grade beef, lacked seasoning, and were overcooked (she ordered medium rare but there was no trace of pink inside). The fries were clearly frozen, definitely not fresh cut. Maybe the waitress didn't know, or maybe she flat out lied about the fries being fresh cut. Either way it was a disappointment.

Left feeling like I overpaid for mediocre food, got price gouged because of allergies, and food was misrepresented by the waitress.

Another reviewer @Tim D. put it perfectly, I wasn't hungry when I left, but I wasn't terribly happy about that. Pretty much sums it up for me."}
{"text":"Great little pizza, tapas, and salad place! I enjoy their happy hour bites menu and the discount on beer and wine from 4-6, and they have a full bar. This location is small so make a reservation or go early if you don't want to wait. They have a discount for LVAC members, but I have always forgotten to use it."}
{"text":"We sat in the patio since we brought our dog. It was a bit chilly outside but they have a heat lamp at the corner. We ordered the chicken chopped salad and the New York style pizza. The portion for the salad was huge. However, I think that there could have probably been more chicken for the amount of salad. They were light with the dressing... I could hardly taste it. I had to ask them for more dressing. The olives were also a bit too salty for me. The chicken could have also been marinated a bit better and could have been less dry. The pizza was decent. It was not anything special. It was thin crusted which I wasn't a big fan of. It was also a bit on the greasy side. But I did like that they added quite a bit of mushrooms. Overall, it tasted similar to something I could get from Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"The service here is great. The food is phenomenal. Wonderful location. The prices are slightly high, but you can be sure that you're getting quality food, that tastes great! There's still a few things I would like to try on the menu, I can't wait!"}
{"text":"I went in here to get a snack while my car was being serviced next door. I thought the pizza was good and the service was fine.Overall pretty satisfying."}
{"text":"My server was great! The food was decent. They are timely and there's a nice seating area and a full bar.. what more can you ask for from an airport restaurant?! They use fresh tomatoes and basil on my margherita pizza, more than I expected from a place like this! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The happy hour half price tapas from 4-7 PM are an outstanding deal.  Duck tacos, hummus and crab dip are great.  Service was also fantastic.  Join their e club and get a free sloppy sundae on your birthday which is HUGE."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten in here; usually when we do Sammy's, we get take out and eat at home. The first time, I waited at the bar and had a pleasant Heineken and wait. We've been here a few time for what we like to think of as Fancy Pizza. We've tried the Arugula and Pear and the Prosciutto pizza, and they were both decent.

We ate it, we were happy, and it was tasty.

It's nothing to write home about, nothing that made us say \"slap my momma, that's a good pizza pie!\", but there's also nothing so wrong with it we felt bad going back. Yelp's \"A-OK\" seems to pretty thoroughly sum up my feelings for this place.

Pros: 
- Decent \"Fancy pizza\", nothing to sing epics about, but nothing wrong with it, either. 
- Easy Parking, short waits
- Friendly bartender
- Simple takeout.

Cons:
- Food is just \"meh\" sometimes
- Golf Country Club vibe."}
{"text":"I've been to the Sammy's on Sahara before but wanted to try this one out.  It won over Five Guys, a place I still want to splurge upon soon.  The dining room is small but the lighting helps keep it inviting.  My party of four ordered two pizzas - Hawaiian and Garlic Shrimp, both were excellent.  I especially liked the Shrimp pizza.  If you're not a fan of garlic though, choose something else.  The server was competant but seemed a bit impatient as well.  All in all, a great meal and experience.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. We've been to other Sammy's before, this one was pretty much the same as every location. Service was adequate, food was okay and prices were inflated.

Pros: Food is decent, not great. Duck tacos were okay (not as amazing as advertised by friends), pizzas are good, not great.

Cons: Way overpriced for the quality. Not exactly an affordable option when you consider what you're getting in terms of quality, taste and size.

We don't eat at Sammy's very often and that probably won't change."}
{"text":"Mini duck tacos are a must when you dine at Sammy's!! For dessert their donuts are sinfully delicious! When I'm with my kids they love to order the cotton candy."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is the hummus. The pita and hummus are the best part of the menu. Great flavor and pita are always served hot. It leaves you smelling a bit garlicky, so make sure your date has a few bites, too. That way you both smell the same."}
{"text":"nice service and yummy foods, don't forget to order their cheese bread!"}
{"text":"I went into Sammys the other day and had Marnie as my server. I will definitely be back! She was absolutely amazing! The food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Who eats airport food and actually raves about it?! No one. Ever! Except for now!!!
So whenever I fly hike from vegans and am taken to the second terminal I tend to eat at sammys- and I always get the same thing every time. The Greek salad is great! It's huge! And it has amazing dressing! I make sure to leave enough time to sneak in a meal before my flight."}
{"text":"Well, for airport food, this isn't bad.  We got a couple of drinks and the hummus which was good and the bread was quality.  

We didn't really have much, but it was a comfortable stop."}
{"text":"Love the food.  After midnight it's 1/2 price tapas.   Duck tacos, hummus, and the breadsticks are the best....."}
{"text":"What a joke. Ordered a $13 pizza, and was asked to wait 15 min. No problem. Asked to wait at a table because I was going to eat it in the restaurant that I just paid for. They asked that I wait at an airport table because their tables (plenty open) were for service. Well comes to find out there was no airport tables open and I politely asked again to wait at a restaurant table, they again rudely said NO.  I Canceled my order and got a refund on principle alone. DONT EAT HERE. DONT PAY THEIR EXORBITANT ALMOST EXTORTION PRICES.  BOYCOTT AT ALL COSTS, THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR PATRONS. SAMMY, get your shit together or get out. Treat people how you would like to be treated or you're going to have a bad time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to LOVE this place, but it just didn't cut the mustard, twice!

My first trip in memory was about a month ago to this location during late lunch.  The place was fairly empty, but the waitress was abrupt and seemed to be in a hurry.  I was in no hurry, as I was dining and catching up with a dear friend.  I felt rushed to order my food and didn't get a great look at the menu.

We started with the hummus, which was some of the best hummus I've ever had.  It was light though on the flat bread.  A clear uneven match of pita bread to the large hummus dish.  I would normally requested more, but I was too busy chit-chatting and had plenty of my main dish to eat, anyways.

I was torn between a salad and the pizza, and went with the pizza since the place is called wood fired pizza.  I went with the Tuscan and was warned by the waitress that it is topped with arugula.  I normally have no problems with arugula, so I was not deterred.  My friend got one of her known favorites, the chopped chicken salad.

Maybe I should have tried her salad instead of the pizza, since she raved about it and it looked delish.  My pizza came out and was a soggy mess.  The arugula was not chopped or cooked really and overtook the pizza.  Probably wouldn't have been so bad if the entire non-edge part of the pizza wasn't soggy.  It was also a semi-strange flavor.  I won't contribute the flavor to not liking that type of veggie pizza because it is the type I order at many other restaurants.  My husband also got the margarita pizza at another Sammy's a different day and it was also a soggy mess.

On another trip to another Sammy's I decided to try the salad, since my friend's was so wonderful the previous trip.  This time I went with the Balsamic Grilled Chicken salad, and I was, again, unimpressed.

I don't want to say I give up on Sammy's since the menu has soo many other great sounding dishes, but I have thus far been unimpressed.  On my list to try at Sammy's is the Greek salad, the Lobster Bisque, the chopped pepperoni salad, and maybe the grilled shrimp tacos.  I won't be in any hurry to try the pizzas again though."}
{"text":"ALWAYS come here for happy hour & never had a bad experience. Great prices ( 50% off all tapas from 3-6 everyday... Even weekends ) and friendly service.  Hopefully you get Alan or Casey as your server, because they are both on top of things AND they have remembered our usual order from the past ( which is great for local customers ). Highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion. Hope you all have the same experience I've had!"}
{"text":"Came here with my man to check out their HH since we were hungry but didn't quite know what we wanted to eat so what better than a whole bunch of different apps/tapas to satisfy our cravings??? 

-Duck Tacos: my boyfriend hates duck but he liked these... Probably because there was really no duck taste to them but they did taste good.. Crunchy with lettuce, tomatoes, creme fraiche and cheese.
-Crispy Tofu: light crust comes with a delicious ginger dipping sauce.
-Mediterranean Plate? With hummus and baba ganoush.. I didn't have any but it looked nice
-Chicken Lettuce Cups: love the butter lettuce that comes with but the chicken filling was too salty 
-Chicken Satay: not bad, not great
-Truffle Fries: definite truffle taste to it... Yum! 

Service was great from server to the food runner! They even brought out a couple different dipping sauces when we just asked for ketchup! HH prices range from $3-$7 .. Great deal! 

HOT TIP: DAILY happy hour 3-6!!! Including $2 off all wine and beer~"}
{"text":"I love Sammy's!!   The service is always fast and friedly, and the food is sooo good!!  There is not 1 thing I ordered from there that I did not like.  And don't forget to get the Messy Sundae for dessert!!  YUMMY!!"}

{"text":"We tried this pizza when they offered take-home valentines packages for $6 a piece. It was pretty good, so we decided to go in and eat. We fell for the fancy pizzas which for me were good but I wouldnt order it again, if that makes sense.  I ordered the Sun Dried tomato, with pine nuts and basil with goat cheese. Sounds a lot better than it tasted. I guess I expected it to taste as good as it did when we made it at home with pep & basil. Sometimes you just need to stick to basics. Surprisingly enough the salads everyone else in the restaurant had ordered looked way better than our pizza. If i go back I'd def. go with the salad."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying Sammy's since they opened their W Sahara restaurant. I love to go for lunch and I always go for my birthday! Their Balsamic Chicken Salad is my favorite! I have tried just about everything but I always go back to the salad. But try the BBQ Chicken Pizza, Duck Tacos and Kobe sliders cuz they are also on my \"love it\" list. The service is always fast and the staff is very friendly. I picked up my dinner this time around and still just as great as if I were seated in the restaurant.  Also, if you want to try two different items, bring and friend and split them. Sammy's is always accommodating. Get the messy sundae, it is a must!"}
{"text":"Who can resist an advertisement for a messy sundae while minding your own business scrolling through your Instagram timeline?! 

Stopped into Sammy's for this delicious disaster a few days ago. My waiter described this sundae as extremely massive and insisted  accommodate three people. I ordered two and they were decent size nothing extraordinary but it satisfied my sweet tooth for the day. My sundae didn't look identical to the one pictured on my social media but I'll let Yelp be the judge."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Can not go wrong lunch or dinner. We love the Grilled Chicken Salad and the pizzas."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience the staff is so rude that I never got a meal.  THE hostess was the most disgusting human being you can imagine
The manager Crystal was equally as terrible. If you go there don't expect anything other than what to expect at a dive. For the rent at an airport lounge this place needs help. Suggestions, ,hire people that want to work."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised in coming here.  I had passed by for years and always thought that for some reason it would have bad quality.  Boy was I wrong.  The pizza crust was just right, nicely wood fired and not to thick.  They had a good selection of toppings, so I didn't feel like I was stuck with a plain jane pizza.

We came during happy hour and were able to try a variety of tapas  at half price.  I admit some of our choices were odd to go with pizza (hummus).  But they were good anyways.  I will come back."}
{"text":"Wasn't happy with my dinner date at Sammy's.. My date and I were heading over for dinner when my date decided we had to go eat pizza at this place. I was ok whatever. I was really in the mood to eat at chili's. So we went in and I wanted to sit out side and my date wanted to eat inside. The host heard us arguing and my date mentioned that I didn't want to eat here and wanted to go to chili's. Anyways the host had to mention that chili's uses microwave to heat up food. At this point I was over this conversation. We sat outside when the waitress came over to get our drinks and the first thing out of her mouth was \"who is the one who doesn't want to eat here?\" How rude is that to ask a guest??? That really pissed me off. So I tried to calm down and ask the waitress how do they do their Babaganush? then she started arguing with me how they do it and they don't use mayo in the Babaganush. I am middle eastern and I know how its supposed to be done. So I ordered the hummus to be safe. The Hummus wasn't fresh nor home made. It tasted like it came from a container added with some oil, parsley and paprika for $9. Plus I ordered Blue Moon which you can get twice the size of that at chili's for half the price. Sorry but I wont not recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"This place is just okay, pizza is a pizza just gourmet style. Atmosphere is pretty laid back which I love alot! Did not really run through the menu because I except it more of a pizza joint. 
I will visit again but not in a top 10 of choices around my area! Staff were very assisting and checks on us at great intervals."}
{"text":"On vacation and my wife found this spot. Great service! Nice martini and a messy sundae for 1st time visitors. Far off the strip but worth your time. Wife loved her arugula pear pizza. Only thing, salmon was slightly overcooked."}
{"text":"I love thin crust pizzas and Sammy's Woodfire does them the way I like it! 

* Brie Cheese with Truffle Oil Artisan Thin Crust Pizza \"From the coast of Brittany, with fresh sauteed wild mushrooms.\"($11.95) - Yum!  I love the flakiness of the baked crispy French style dough.  I think almost anything would be good on this kind of dough!  The thinner the better! 

* Diavola Rustic Neapolitan Pizza \"Salami, smoked Gouda, fresh mozzarella, roasted red bell peppers, spinach, crushed red chilies, with our homemade sauce.\" ($10.95) - A pretty looking pizza with thick slices of salami that are hard to miss.  The Husband liked this, but was digging my artisan thin crust even more! 

It's only our second time ever at a Sammy's Woodfire and we usually stick to the pizzas only despite them offering so much other kinds of foods.

Service - Jason was our waiter and what a friendly guy he was.  No complaints at all - personable and enjoyable!

Sidenote: They have diaper changing stations in both the women's AND the men's restrooms!  So, I would say they definitely make this place baby friendly!"}
{"text":"Sammy's Woodfired Pizza in Henderson sits along the back of the shopping center that holds Joe's Crab Shack and Barley's Casino.  Walking in, I get the feeling that this is definitely a family kind of restaurant, where you spend a simple dinner out with the family on Sunday evenings.

We both decided on their pizza for dinner.  (But did start off with bread and butter, it's upon request.)

* Vegetarian Pizza \"Grilled vegetables including eggplant, onions, zucchini, bell peppers and red onions with fontina cheese, roasted garlic sauce and roma tomatoes.\" ($9.95) - It was a good pizza, although I wished the garlic sauce was heavier, it was only faintly there.  Some mushrooms would make it that much better!

* New York Style Pizza \"Our homemade tomato sauce with sauteed mushrooms, pepperoni, salami, and Italian sausage.\" ($10.95) - The Husband tried to order this with their Artisan thin crust for $2 more, but the waitress didn't really suggest it.  She said it was cracker thin, so he decided to order it as is.  It came out just fine, and the thinness was good too.  His pizza was saltier than mine, and definitely had more kick.  I overheard a couple of neighboring tables order this same pizza too. It must be a favorite! 

Service was good.  The waitress refilled the Husband's soda without having to ask, although I could have used a refill on my water. She did come by and check on us and she was friendly, so we didn't really have any issues with service here.

3.5 stars.

They have a happy hour daily from 4 pm to 6 pm; at the bar only on Fridays and Saturdays.  Half-price tapas and house wine.

They also have a Tasty Bytes club.

A kids' menu is offered for those 10 and under, with items under $6 (and that includes a soda or milk)."}
{"text":"Waitresses have been great down to earth ladies, prices are fine and on point with me, gluten free and vegan options is awesome, food tastes great. So why the 3 rating you ask???  Well they have a manger who has worked at this location for 10 yrs who just simply has no social skills and whom I was most unimpressed with.....When someone orders a pizza that has gluten free crust and vegan cheese please do not question the customer when dropping off the order at the table asking \"Excuse me dose your cheese have an allergy ?\" 
 Needless to say the look on my face had a WTF moment. He repeated again \"Dose your cheese have an allergy?\" And repeated allergy, allergy....
   My advice to the gentleman manager is to learn to phrase his question in English a bit more properly. The question was none of his dam business why or how I ever order my pizza. He seems like a major douche bag.
    At the end of the day that's my only qualm with the resterant. Everything else is great. Even the bathrooms. And I am a hard sell for any business."}

{"text":"We ordered two of the sliced steak dish. For $15 each I expected a bed of fresh cut fries. Fries appeared to be the frozen type out of a bag. Shrimp and chicken satay on the Asian Sampler was below par. Portions are small for the price."}
{"text":"Only the best spot in Vegas, my husband keeps coming back for the duck tacos, this spot has been in our must stops since we lived here in 2005! We are passing by today and skipped the strip for our old Tim favorite spot before I turned plant base, having fish maybe twice a year anyway they have great vegan options for people like me... while my hubby enjoys his favorites . Do your self a favor stop here where we have seen many high profile entertainers eat here . We've seen a few but never bother them lol."}
{"text":"Awesome pizzas and many other options if you are trying to eat more healthy.  The oak roasted salmon is a nice option as well as the chopped chicken salad.  There are a ton of gluten free options for those with an intolerance. I highly recommend the chicken tequila fettuccine and the messy sundae is amazing."}
{"text":"Special offer through yelp does not work. Called and they claim an email will be sent, never came in 5 days.  Misleading advertising is not the way to attract new customers. 

Update, owner msg'd me and made an offer to make it right (i do not plan on going though). Good on Sammys to take care of problems, for that 3 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious salads and pizza! My favorite salad by far is the Asian Chicken Salad. The Thai salad is pretty good as well. Very easy to call in and pick up food if you do not want to eat in. The dining room is pretty small and can easily get packed during lunch. They do have a nice outside patio for sitting during the summer. They now serve hard alcohol as well which is a great addition to the business. Overall, chill place to come and eat some good food."}
{"text":"Zack over at Sammy's is a versatile worker. Aside from the amazing food here (each time I come here it takes an easy 5 extra minutes to glance at the menu bc of their overwhelming selection), Zack represented the business with stellar guest service. Will be back with more of my friends! Thank you!"}
{"text":"At 10 pm, we were starving and didnt want fast food. Their sign said tavern open 24 hours, so, expecting greasy fried bar food, we stopped in. It. Was. Amazing. My boyfriend had chicken, i had steak. Fresh and perfectly cooked (no freezer-rubbery meat here). Their potatoes? I have no clue what they do to them but SO good. Green beans were fresh too! No squeaky freezer beans! They were a little oily but i didnt care because they were so good! So pleasantly surprised to find a delicious stop when we only stopped in on a whim! Great quality food we were not expecting from a 24 hour bar!"}
{"text":"Food was good, I had the Thai Chicken pizza and it was good. There were a little too many peanuts in it and the mint was a little too strong. But, it was good and I will try again."}
{"text":"The wife and I were leaving Las Vegas on a mid-morning flight out of McCarran.  A captive audience in the D Gate area and wanting more than just a cup of coffee, we decided on Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill since they served breakfast and we could sit down, charge our personal electronics, and relax before our flight.  We were greeted by Janet, our personable server, who excelled at keeping our water glasses filled throughout our meal.  Leftover pizza is one of my favorite breakfasts, so it was intriguing to me try a pizza specifically made for breakfast.  My 8 inch pie ($11.49) was topped with a surprisingly generous amount of bacon, eggs, mushroom, cheese, tomato, and onion.  While the crust was very likely not made fresh on premises, it was reasonably crisp given the amount and type of toppings.  It was a much tastier crust than you'd find a Pizza Hut, Dominoes, or Papa John's.   Frankly, it was a filling, satisfying breakfast adaptation of pizza that could easily be shared.   

For airport dining, Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and Grill exceeded my expectations.  Compared to your average airport dining experience, it was measurably better than average.  It should go without saying that while I gave it a solid 4 stars, that rating was compared to other airports restaurants catering to a captive audience of air travelers and probably not comparable to other Sammy's stores let alone most of Las Vegas' excellent dining options.  Bottom line:  It'll satisfy for your hunger before your flight home."}
{"text":"Came in here after a horrible experience at Apple Bees and thankfully everything from customer service to the atmosphere was amazing!

We ordered a couple of pizzas, a chicken wrap and a salad. All of these items were amazing! The chicken wraps are gluten free which is great. They also have vegan options."}
{"text":"Sammy's is:
- A relaxing place for happy hour (4-6)! 
- Drinks, $2 OFF; Tapas, Half Price; Excellent Service.

OUR HAPPY HOUR EXPERIENCE:
- My wife and I had an enjoyable happy hour experience at Sammy's yesterday evening (Monday) over delicious food and drinks! 

- For drinks, we had Cab ($5/glass), which was pretty good. For Tapas, we had: (1) Mini Duck Tacos ($5.25), flavorful and great presentation; (2) Garlic Cheese Flat Bread ($3.50), tasty, good texture; (3) Lettuce Cups ($5), deliciously flavored finely diced chicken meat filling (though a bit too salty), with butter lettuce leaves for wraps!  They all tasted heavenly! 

- The service was outstanding! Our young lady waitress, Samantha, was extremely friendly and efficient! By the way, we got in the restaurant just 10min before the the happy hour was over. Samantha made sure that our drink and food orders went in promptly, and assured us that our second drinks would be at happy hour price, too. She was attentive, always keeping an eye on tables she served. - A great waitress, indeed! In fact, some guests came in a few min AFTER 6, and Samantha was still able to get them the HH prices! This is a good restaurant practice, also. Customers would appreciate that!

We will definitely go back to Sammy's, and try out other dishes on the menu! 

THE RESTAURANT DECOR & AMBIENCE:
- This Sammy's is in the large Grand Montecito Plaza; at the corner of the circular court yard. At the entrance is the bar area with an inviting bar counter and several bar tables. Both wings of the bar are 2 nice dining rooms. It also has an attractive medium size patio seating area by the court yard. One can enjoy HH anywhere in the restaurant. The windows along the entire front wall privides a pleasant view of the court yard. This restaurant has a relaxing ambience.

{"text":"Sammy's at Sahara is a relaxing, comfortable place for happy hours:
4-6pm AND Midnight-8am! 
- It also has a smoke-free, 24-hr Tavern!

Before coming to this Sahara location, my wife and I had visited another Sammy's by Durango/Elkhorn and we loved it (separate review). I am glad to report that this Sahara locale also has all the niceties typical of Sammy's. It has the same great HH menu with $2 off drinks and half price tapas, and excellent service! Although its patio has only a view of the parking lots, it does have a charming fire pit. The restaurant has an impressive building exterior; a nice entrance through the patio; a comfortable bar counter and 2 wings of small dining areas. Next to one side of the dining room is its famous 24-hr Tavern.

MY HAPPY HOUR EXPERIENCE:
- Per fellow Yelpers' good recommendations, I dropped by this nice place 2days ago for early happy hour, and had a delightful experience.  As expected, since it was a Monday, the place was not crowded, with only a few tables of guests. 
- Thinking out loud: If they extend the happy hours to 7pm (like Gordon Biersch, Kona Grill, Embers, and Chicago Brewing Co.), it might draw more people coming after work.

Here, I enjoyed, once again, the pork dumplings (3.50), and mini duck tacos (5.25), a beer (3) and a cab (5), all of them just as tasty as those served at the other Sammy's! Being by myself this time, though, I couldn't get all my favorite dishes. Sigh! I had to pass up the garlic cheese flat bread and the lettuce cups! Would have been even nicer with more people to share and sample more temptations! My bill came to a reasonable $18 (plus tips). Not bad!

The waitress was very friendly. But she was working all alone for our section, so was not too attentive, though adequate. One of the managers (Jeff?) was helping her out, though, which is a mark of excellence for management. Another friendly lady manager (Heather) also dropped by at various tables to chat a little with customers. Both managers were super pleasant, making customers feel welcome. They pointed out to me the unique features of this particular locale, such as the reverse happy hour (midnight-8am) and its 24-hr Tavern, which is supposed to be smoke-free, too. 

- Yah, I'm putting this locale on my own \"List of Favorite Bars in the Summerlin Neighborhood Area for Happy Hours\"!

This is a weekly institution!!!"}
{"text":"Sammy's is now one of my favorite places to eat. The food is fantastic as is the service. It takes wowing me to get a five start, but when they told me that all first time guests get a free \"Messy Sundae.\" I was sold. We had a couple different flavors of the pizza which was fantastic both that night and warmed over as left overs. The sundae was out of this world and well done. We truly enjoyed and it is definitely worth a trip. We will be back. Thanks for a great time!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is so yummy and the service is great. A lot of the waiter's and waitress' recognize us now when we arrive. My husband and I always order the same thing and share it - beef satay skewers, garlic cheese bread and their little sliders. I always ask for an extra side of their chipotle aioli. It's perfect, a little spicy and so tasty! And we love their homemade pickles. We have tried to make them ourselves but gave up when we couldn't figure it out. The prices are really reasonable too. In the summer we can arrive early enough to get half price tapas and in the winter I wait until I get their 20% off coupon. For what we order, it works out about the same. This is only my second review but next time I go there, I'm going to take a couple of photos of my food. I love how it's presented. So pretty!"}
{"text":"I've come in a few times for Happy Hour tapas- they're pretty good and you can't beat the price. 

One note I wanted to put is that I had the Lebni cheese tonight. I like their flatbread and I like soft cheeses and Mediterranean spices... they put a spice mix on the cheese and all over the bread. I shook the bread and a lot of spices fell off so I would maybe recommend to just get spices on the cheese and tell them to skip the bread since apparently it is the norm to throw on that much spice mix. They replaced it with a new one right away. 

Got some duck tacos which are always good. Braised asparagus with Romano shavings, balsamic and prosciutto- perfectly cooked veggie. I eat a lot of \"real\" Italian food and this is something we definitely would have at dinner since it's clean fresh, simply done flavors.

Service has always been decent here so I don't have any big complaints about this location."}
{"text":"I like Sammys, it's not bad of a chain. I like that they have something for everyone, different flavor fusions. 

Pizza has a nice crust and I love all the flavor combos- I like the garlic shrimp so far. Duck tacos were good.My favorite thing is the ahi or salmon sliders. I've been to this one like 3 times and a total of 5 times to a different location so I havent tried much, but all has been good and satisfying portions.

 Why I give it 5 stars is the service was very attentive, some of the best I've gotten at a casual joint actually. This location has a very attentive staff, back of the house was quick with orders but still cooked things right- kudos! One lunch day in particular a mens baseball team, their kids and familes filled the restaurant soon after we ordered. Our waiter was taking care of us even though they got sieged. Drinks didn't get neglected, had a drink before mine was done. Checked on us often and got our tab taken care of fast.  I do appreciate when people are warm and genuinely friendly- service with a smile does count just as equally as speed and attentiveness."}
{"text":"Bad service, no knowledge of the menu, and the meat on the pizza had freezer burn. Good for a chain, but not the gourmet experience they strive for."}
{"text":"We had 2 thin crust pizzas. The 1st was a baruta n pesto. What I noticed right away was how good the crust was. The thinness and the type of oven must have had something to do with it. The mozzarella and pesto were actually toppings. It was a nice change and I haven't had pizza this way in a while. What's good about this style is that the you can really appreciate the taste of the pesto because it stands out more for some reason. The globs of mozzarella stayed melty for lil bit, which I enjoyed because I really like it that way and it helped contrast against the pesto. The sauce was a light marinara which was a nice non overpowering base for the pizza. There were also whole pine nuts to help bring out all the flavors of the pesto. I still have to have my meat and chix is my preference. Excellent pizza. The 2nd was a sun dried tomato w/goat cheese thin crust. The tomato was very good and overall flavor, but the extreme gaminess of the goat cheese really threw it off for me. I couldn't get over it  and picturing goat fur :(. So, I went back to the pesto pizza :). The service was good but for some reason, maybe because it near the end of the night and everyone was probably tired, it just didn't stand out. The place itself was really nice but it was somewhat confused w/being a sports bar. You just don't hear the game and although the music is light rock, it's kinda loud. This place is good, but I don't need to be at a real sit down and pay more when there's so many good casual places around here."}
{"text":"Not a fan, took my son here for lunch. Menu seems fairly limited and over priced. I've had better pizza at the larger chains."}
{"text":"Was extremely surprised when I walked into Sammy's for the first time and found out that they are not just a straight Italian place. I was pleasantly surprised and loved the menu options. We ordered the burrata and pesto pizza (I love, love, love burrata) and the Mediterranean Sampler appetizer with hummus, Baba ghanoush and a cheese spread. 

Food was fantastic... loved every bite of both dishes. Service was on point as well. Bit pricey but really good quality food so can't complain too much. Looking forward to going back and trying some more items.... they should just put burrata on everything :)"}
{"text":"Meh. We were looking for food out by my grandparent's place in the Vegas outskirts. They wanted Pizza Hut, but the rest of us wanted something \"better\". Wood-fired pizza sounded like it'd hit the spot.

Upon being seated we were presented with our low-contrast menus. The low light--unnecessary for a pizza joint even if it's supposed to be \"fancy\"--made them almost impossible to read. The options looked good enough: normal \"meat\" pies, pies with arugula and balsamic, bbq chicken... we got one of each. I got some pot stickers because I had a feeling that \"gourmet\" meant \"small\".

The potstickers were of the previously-frozen variety (I know, what should I expect from potstickers from a pizza joint) and were tasty, but nothing I couldn't have gotten from Trader Joe's. The pizzas were better than previously-frozen quality, but they were like that guy in the bar trying so hard to be cool but just looked like a dick. The crust was fine but did not have much of a \"wood fired\" flavor. The toppings were ok, but nothing really wowed us.

Our server tried to be friendly, but like everything else at this place seemed a bit awkward and out of place. The ambient noise--a feature of the tile floors and solid walls more than anything actually going on--made it difficult for us to hear each other, further frustrating the situation.

I can't believe I'm recommending Chili's, but it *is* across the parking lot from this place and you know what you're getting..."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and available 24 hours which is a definite plus. We love hanging out at the bar, talking to Taylor or Kat but we have one major issue. My husband is a big sports fan and we would like to spend more time here watching our favorite teams but for some reason no one can pick up the phone and call directv for HD boxes. The TV's are HD but they just don't have HD boxes. Wouldn't even cost them anymore most likely."}
{"text":"The fries are really good. The pizza and pastas are pretty good. Service is friendly. Bathrooms are as clean as can be. Definitely want to come here again."}
{"text":"Love the appetizer with Lebne and Pita. It's so good. We ordered a giant salad with chicken and between the Lebne appetizer and the salad, we were stuffed. The salad was really good. We did preset a beverage with basil, cucumber and tonic which would have been delicious but the tonic water was overpowering. Soda water would have been better. The service was excellent. I stop here every time I'm catching a flight in Vegas."}
{"text":"I am not really a pizza person and I was kind of worried about going to a restaurant that specialized in pizza.. But I was pleasently surprised! 

My boyfriend and I came here on a weeknight and it was so great! We ordered hummus before our actual meal and the hummus was so warm and the bread taste like it was made right there in the kitchen! It was so good! 

We then ordered our pizza and it was a perfect size for just us two and we even took some home! The service was so great and they were attentive with out over doing it! It was such a great experience and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. I would recommend eating here for sure. The bad ~ the grilled chicken is always dry. Someone needs to explain to the cooks that your not supposed to slice meat the second you take it off the grill. No one EVER greets me when I walk in, even managers stare with blank faces. Aside from that, the happy hour is decent, wine selection not great, but the salads and pizzas are pretty good."}
{"text":"Meh. Being that it's in an airport I should have known better than to expect a half decent meal. I met up with a coworker there for a quick bite before catching our flight home.

Pretty bland salad with overcooked dry chicken on it. At least the iced tea was ok. The dining area itself seemed way too warm also. Hello? it's 96 outside today. Crank up the AC!

A redeeming factor was our waitress. She was so good and sweet, The kind of older lady that calls you \"sweetie\" and \"darling\". 

Otherwise, it's basic airport food and nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"My friend & I stopped in for lunch before an afternoon of shopping. We were headed to the Chilis next door but the tapas sign out front caught our eye. More than just pizza!? Score. Tapas!? Double score! Since neither of us had ever been to a Sammy's & tapas were sounding good at the moment, we decided to check it out. 
We ordered the Thai chicken pizza, the Lebni cheese tapa & the parm crusted artichokes. 
1st, I must give major love & all props to the Parmesan crusted artichokes. Not exactly what I was expecting, since I didn't see the words Deep Fried Artichoke Heart anywhere in the description but eh, I'm not complaining. These made me want to slap my mama. So f'ing good. I'm currently craving them right now & trying to figure out how to convince my hubby to go pick some up. 
Lebni cheese- not my thing. Not bad, not good, just not up my alley, ya feel me? My friend loved it. 
Thai chicken pizza- not as thin crust as the waitress led us to believe it would be. It was just ok. I personally like Thai flavors on my pizza, even peanut sauce, my friend not so much, says she prefers that kinda thing cold. 
The service was just so-so. I asked for water with lemon. Then I had to ask 3 more times for the lemon. I should be used to this by now bc this always happens to me at every restaurant even though I always ask for \"water with lemon please\" when they ask what I want to drink. I think I need to just start bringing my own lemon with me everywhere. Then we also asked what spices were in the Lebni cheese appetizer & she said she really didn't know but would find out. I still don't know what the spices were. 
I don't think I'll ever be back for the pizza unless it's to try one of their supposedly thinner crusted  \"artisan pizzas\" but those artichoke hearts are going to be a hard habit to break!"}
{"text":"Been here for lunch and dinner. Solid pizzas and burgers. Wait staff are always nice and friendly, what more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Wow truly the worst place you can go to they don't even have the original plain cheese pizza DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Too bad I checked yelp having having ordered...worst place ever. Go to Burger King across the hall for less greasy and more tasteful food. Absolutely disgusting"}
{"text":"Been waiting 30 mins for a pizza and waitress says she can't give me any idea of when it will be out. At a restaurant in an airport they should have some idea. About to ask for a to go box...."}
{"text":"Went there while on vacation last week and had the chicken and hummus wrap and would recommend it big time. My sisters chicken and feta wrap was good as well. Don't get the cole slaw with the wrap, get the fries which are well done and tasty."}
{"text":"My son and I had dinner here for the first time and we will go back. The food was good and service was good, my only complaint is they only have bottle beer and not very many. They should have a few on draft :) I wanna go back for happy hour that is only from 4 to 6"}
{"text":"Duck tacos! Their pizza is horrendous, don't even think of getting it. Duck tacos! Grilled asparagus! Cotton candy! Oh, and duck tacos!"}
{"text":"I'm basing this review from our first experience here. I will update it on our next visit. I'm sad to give this place 3 stars. My husband and I went to have a quick dinner here. The place is very welcoming. We got seated right away and the service and food came very fast! We were out & about within 45 minutes. We really love California Pizza Kitchen but it's a 20 minute drive from us and Sammy's woodfired pizza is just around our neighborhood. We ordered truffle fries w/ chipotle aioli (4/5), thai chicken pizza (4/5), and shrimp angel hair pasta (1/5). CPK's thai chicken pizza is still the best. Truffle fries was great but not excellent. It tasted better when the server paired it with chipotle aioli so make sure you ask for it. The shrimp angel hair pasta was so disappointing. It tasted bland for $19. No flavor at all; I just added lots of parmesan cheese to make it taste good. Their serving is generous! We will be coming back for sure but will explore different food from their menu. 

((((they give 20% military discount!!!))))"}
{"text":"Medicore food at best. I had the Kobe Beef sliders and my hubby had the hawaiian pizza. My sliders tasted lke cheap cafeteria meat but the fries were good. Hubby said he had better pizza at pizza hut. The service was ok. Our waitress was a bit flirty for my taste and the manager who was cleaning tables kep staring at us like we stole something. Not impressed! This military family \"Will not return\"...!!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong at Sammy's. The salads are really good. My favorite is the Grilled Shrimp. The Chinese Chicken and Thai Chicken are both really good too."}
{"text":"Christmas is a time to be with family and it doesn't matter where you spend it as long as you spend it with loved ones.  We decided to eat at Sammy's Woodfired Pizza since my step dad loves vegetarian pizza and anything vegetables.  We thought that only Asian restaurants were open but luckily they were.

Hosts greeted us with smiles and politeness.  Being Christmas Eve, you'd think they would be miserable working.  After we sat down, we ordered our drinks.  Bread and butter is served as requested since they were conserving - per the menu.  So, we ordered it anyway just because.  

As for dinner our order were as follows:
1.)  Vegetarian Pizza - Trilled eggplant, onions, zucchini, bell peppers, red onions, tomatoes, fontina, with roasted garlic sauce.  
This was surprisingly tasty and delicious.  I can't be more satisfied with how this turned out.  

2.)  Chilled Roast Vegetable Salad - Spinach, fresh mozzarella pearls, Edamame, artichoke, yellow tomato, red bell pepper, onion, basil, lemon, balsamic, extra virgin olive oil.
This was an awesome salad.  For all the vegetarians out there, I'd recommend ordering this as well as the Vegetarian Pizza.  I loved the combination of the vegetables with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  

3.)  Mini Kobe Beef Hamburgers - Kobe Beef with Chipotle aioli.
It was definitely delicious and the bf definitely felt full after the two out of three mini burgers were devoured.  His eyes were definitely bigger than his stomach and couldn't finish it.

We were completely stuffed we couldn't fit any dessert in our tummy.  Normally I don't like the pizza's this restaurant has to offer but I will make an exception to the Vegetarian menu.  :D"}
{"text":"Duck tacos, shrimp artichoke dip,shrimp and grits,salads,brie cheese truffle oil pizza, kobe beef mini cheese burgers, guys the list goes on... for their desserts  their messy chocolate sundae. Always one of our favs period"}
{"text":"This is a favorite of our entire family.  When company comes to town we hit Sammy's.  Daughter and kids can't wait to go there to eat.  Love their Caesar Salad and Angel Hair Pasta.  Service is always attentive and food great."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I had the chicken with the pesto and pine nuts and I really enjoyed it. It is light, but filling. Chicken is a little bland, but other flavors go great with it. My boyfriend had the Hawaiian style pizza and i'm not a fan of pineapples on my pizza so I didn't try it, but the crust was real good! Will be going back! Great Service. I have to also give acknowledgement to Casey! He's a great server."}
{"text":"All I can say is the quick bite to eat was satisfying, but menu is limited. They have other locations and the San Diego location has a larger menu selection. Price was good and service was good as well.

I'm giving it 3 stars and would give it 3.5, but there is no option for .5 star."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! Average service. 

Finally made it out to this place on a Wednesday night. We were seated promptly and there were only a handful of people in the restaurant.  The restaurant is filled with a whole bunch of 4 seater tables without wall separations and booths that line the walls so yes, I imagine you would overhear a lot of conversations if the place is packed. 

Both of us shared the lobster mac & cheese starter, Balsamic Grilled Chicken salad and LaDou's Barbecue Chicken pizza - total bill ~$35, decent priced dinner for 2 in my opinion.

- mac & cheese came in an oval dish the size of my hand (see pic) and was bomb-dig as mac & cheese should be. 
- salad was plentiful - pretty sure I'd be full if that was my meal. There was adequate chicken to salad ratio and the gorgonzola cheese provided to right kick.  
- bbq pizza was tasty, no complaints

Every dish we ate was so freaking delicious - the food did not disappoint!! We didn't try dessert but I can only imagine it is just as awesome.  The service was average; not poor, but not exceptional. 

I will most def be coming back here again; delicious food for a decent price. This is a place I could eat at every month."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service from John was very good as well. They created some excellent dishes that were not on the menu to please our appetite. I appreciate great service, and appreciate the visit from the manager to explain our meal delay, and ensure our comfort and pleasure with the meal at the end!"}
{"text":"If I were a vengeful late night eater, this may have been a 3-star update, but I understand that things happen and that when I am starving at midnight, I may have an attitude. I am leaving it at 4-stars because I am sure the food is still the same; however, I wouldn't exactly know because the past two times I have visited, I have left without anything to eat. On the first visit, I wasn't too hungry, but it was after midnight, and when we walked into the 24-hour tavern, I was so disappointed to smell the stench of smoke. Yes, they now allow smoking, and on that night, I didn't want to deal with the smoke while eating. Round two: It is after 11pm, but I am okay with dealing with smoke because I am starving and an arugula pizza sounds divine. However, after sitting at a table for at least 10 minutes, the only interaction was a bartender telling us it was a shift change and someone would be with us in a minute while he proceeded to clear tables, restock ice and take his closing tables checks, so after those 10 minutes, I left. I was just too hungry. All of this to say: snooze on their 24-hour tavern. (See previous update for reference.) Stick to the main squeeze. I can't imagine we will keep this on our 24-hour dining options after the past two visits."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch w/my son.  Margherita pizza, duck tacos  and truffle fries.  Great service and food.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I was highly impressed by this place. But that does not rally meam ouch as i went into eating here with completely low standards. Also the restaurant was chosen gust because of its close proximate to my house. 

The pizza i ordered was exactly what I expected it to be. My dad ordered a small thai chicken salad and took about a third of it home. The prices seemed about a buck or two too high per item but that is probably how they make their margin. The service was fine and the food tasty but nothing overly impressive to take it out of the three star range and into the superb ranks."}
{"text":"good food.  great atmosphere for groups.  gets really busy for lunch.  The bread that they serve when you first sit down can be really good or stale.  Sometimes it's stale, and you can't even eat it, sometimes it's warm and great.   Very inconsistant on their bread.  Pizzas are really good.  Priced reasonable"}
{"text":"DELISH!!  my husband and i sat on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful weather; along with a bottle of half-priced wine wednesday merlot (14 hands).  our caesar salad was spicy and delicious, lobster mac n cheese was cheesy and flavorful and the new york pizza left me wanting more!  no seriously, on the way home i told my husband we should've taken one to go!  our server James was friendly and attentive.  all in all a great first time experience, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and nice atmosphere with wonderful service."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was great. Nice wine selection."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with the salads or the pizza.  And some chicken satays to start.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I usually fly out of Vegas late at night between 10pm and 1am, and Samy's is by far my favorite spot to kill time and have a decent meal and a glass of wine.

I read some of the negative feedback here on Yelp, and I don't agree to most of them.

To begin with, the pizzas are very good, definitively NOT your Papa John's or Pizza Hut style (if you love those than maybe you will have issues with Sammy's). The Five Cheese is my favorite: very tasty, mildly spicy, loaded with cheese, thin crust.

I also enjoy their fairly priced wine selection (Pinot Grigio is very good).

Staff was always ultra friendly and attentive, and they don't bug you if you have to stick around for a couple of hours.

Highly recommended for tired passengers.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Waiter carried a massive chip on his shoulder. They don't carry many items that show on their main website. There was a burger King across from them that in hind sight would have been a better option. (This coming from someone who avoids fast food )"}
{"text":"I love a good salad - and Sammy's has some of my favorites! They have several options in the $10ish range, and service is speedy so it's a great stop for lunch. I like the shrimp salad with feta cheese and sunflower seeds and the chinese chicken salad is a close second. While their pizzas are pretty fantastic (Brie and mushroom, heck yes!), their lighter fare is quite tasty as well."}
{"text":"They have ruined the menu. The tapas happy hour is terrible. No wonder there is no customers in the place at dinner hour. I won't be back. Terrible management"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to stop in for a quick drink or food before a flight. We sat at the bar and ordered a few drinks and some fries, the bartender was quick and helpful which was nice. The fries are delicious, so try them."}
{"text":"This chain restaurant which is right in front of a chilli's didn't impressed me one bit. The food is overpriced for what you get. The NY pizza we order was ok and nothing all that special on flavor or quality.
The vegetarian salad we order came w a bit to much sauce and it's flavor wasn't balanced and to everything else the salad they sent at first was not even the right one. I couldn't recommend this place to anyone and you would be better served by eating pizza at a PT'S PUB."}
{"text":"I'm giving this two stars instead of one because the server was quite nice. The food on the other hand was fairly tragic. The pizza was odd, contained extreme amounts of garlic, and was too salty. The Greek salad was drenched in dressing. The lobster bisque tasted bitter. And the truffle fries were mediocre at best."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to LV a pal suggested we try Sammys. the food with fun, creative and not so strongly flavored that your first action while getting in the car is to grab gum. The salads are good sized and the pizza have a nice balanced flavor. Ask the wait staff for suggestions or any customization you need - they were knowledgeable and very helpful"}
{"text":"I would rate Sammy's a 3.5 but I'll be nice and upgrade to a four star rating. I'd describe Sammy's Woodfire Grill as an upscale, modern pizza joint.  Upon walking in, I was surprised at how nice the restaurant was. The decor was pleasing to the eye and the dim lighting contributed to the overall ambience.  

The menu items were more expensive than I'd anticipated ($6 for fries). The hubs and I both ordered pizzas at $11.75 each. I was happy to learn that the pizzas were more than enough for 1 person. Neither of us finished our pizzas and we each took home two slices for leftovers. The pesto pizza I ordered was loaded with cheese and tasted great. The pizzas were oily but I didn't mind one bit. 

Service was okay. We used a coupon from the Entertainment Book for Las Vegas and scored $9 off, so for two people the bill came to around $20. I would come back to Sammy's- I hear their happy hour is pretty epic."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good!

I am not a fan of chain restaurants and had not been to Sammy's before, so when I heard we were going there I wasn't to excited, specially when I heard about Pizza, Baba Ghanoush and Edamame, among other things, being on the same menu! However, once the food arrived my attitude changed with every bite and spoon!

Folks, the pizza is good, salads are fresh, and yes even the Baba Ghanoush is very tasty! 

Our server was a young man who did a great job putting up with our big group of eclectic eaters. The finished plates did not stay on our table for long and those who tried the off the tab beer menu seemed happily buzzed!

For those of you who are big on desserts, there a few, but tempting options available. Our group would vouch for the Messy Sundae!"}
{"text":"On my drive to and from the Las Vegas Strip, I always pass by a restaurant called Sammy's Woodfired Pizza (http://www.sammyspizza.com). Its usually packed so why not give it a try. Our entertainment book had a coupon for $8 off an item. I guess thats better than nothing. The place on a Friday night was pretty busy. We got there at 6pm right in time for happy hour, 4-7pm. The problem? Happy hour is only in the bar and we really wanted to sit in the restaurant portion. Oh wells... So we sit down at a booth and looked over the menu. The menu looks pretty good and we decided to order two tapas and a woodfired pizza. We order the Hummus with Ground Kobe Beef, Chicken Lettuce Cups, and the LaDou's Barbecue Chicken pizza. Overall the food was pretty good. I would definitely eat here again. The prices were reasonable and the portions likewise. Now if I could only get my hands on some more coupons..."}
{"text":"Service was okay but the food was not worth the price.  Ordered a salad, pizza, soup, and a drink and my tab came out to $39.  The chicken on the balsamic chicken salad was dry and didn't have enough dressing; the pizza was small and did not have much topping.  I would have much rather gone to california pizza kitchen for much better tasting food and service for the same price."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant after 9, thinking they were still open. They had just changed their hours and were closed, however the server on duty asked us to have a seat and took care of us anyway. Service was EXCELLENT and we WILL be back ( during regular business hours )"}
{"text":"First time at Sammy Pizza and Grill on a Double date with our friends. Best Service in Las Vegas Excellent waitress She made us feel so comfortable and are Drinks was always field If you haven't been to Sammy Pizza and Grill I highly recommend you Check it out. Number one in my book!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered vegan pizza for pick up order. Excellent pizza. They even have gluten free crust if you want that. Definitely going to come back - one of the few places to get vegan pizza with Daiya in town. I had the Margherita pizza with Daiya cheese."}
{"text":"Well I'm so sad to say,!! This is our go to place always early, but today the waitress was ummm rude. She ignored us after she dropped the food off and never came back. She kept attending to a larger party I guess because it was just my husband and I she assumed we wouldn't tip as much. Little did she know I believe in big tipping. I asked her hello excuse me, can I please have more water. When she brought the water she stated \" here you go\" and stormed off. She was attending to the large party. And I felt a little bad for butting in on whatever they were asking about but I was almost at the point of choking. I'm sorry to say she was a horrible waitress. Long day but it's not my fault. Food excellent but waitress Adrienne was very much rude. ."}
{"text":"Sammy's had a little bit of everything delicious. If I want to split a pie, if I want a delicious salad, or I can't decided on one dish, I can get a few tapas.

My last trip, I sat outside on the patio. A beautiful 70 degree day in January isn't wasted on me. I came starving and glanced over the menu. My lunch mates were also craving everything, so we settled on a few tapas and a pizza.

We ordered the Chicken Lettuce Cups, Mini Duck Tacos, and Parmesan Crusted Artichokes. The lettuce cups were flavorful and light. I didn't care too much for the duck tacos, but my girlfriend loved them, and she devoured the rest of mine, my favorite was the artichoke. They were deep-fried and came with a yummy sauce. Indulgent and sinful. My favorite of the entire meal. 

The pizza we ordered was the Sun-Dried Tomato (Artisan crust) which was topped with goat cheese, pine nuts, and basil. Me, oh my. This was a very nontraditional pie and the flavors were fresh and bold. The pine nuts added a fun crunch twist, usually reserved for just the crust. I would order this again and again.

Being fatty patties, we ordered the salted caramel pudding which is pretty much sex in glass. ORDER IT! I only state that sternly because it's like crack (addictive) and I need other people to understand/feel my pain.

Sammy is a great bet for those with different dietary needs. The have an assortment of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free goodies. Service is always attentive. It's a quiet, relaxed atmosphere. This particular location has a bar that is open 24/7 and offers the same menu."}
{"text":"The vegetarian pizza is so good, you don't even miss the meat. If you have a sweet tooth, try the fresh donuts with the chocolate and raspberry sauces. It takes a few minutes, but is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Came back for happy hour, and their quality has not changed one bit... they remain AWESOME. From a good selection of wines (although a little pricey), to awesome bites for $3-$4, this is the right place if you want to have a fun time with friends after work. Our waiter was very accommodating and recommended some great drinks and dishes for the evening. I will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Wow!  Their menu is spectacular!  In comparison to the various other restaurants that serve \"pizza and the like,\" you can't go wrong with the prices and even moreso, the variety of ingredients Sammy's has!

For starters, their mini duck tacos were outstanding!  Whoa, a small biteful that gives your mouth a bang with their feta cheese, tomatoes, cabbage and a creamy tomato-cilantro sauce!  THE KIDS ATE IT!  That's enough for me to say!  Wished I could have eaten more of it...

To give you an idea of what's on the menu for appetizers, there's hummus w/ground kobe beef, Mediterranean or coconut shrimp skewers, baba ghanoush, and Thai chicken satay to name a few.

My husband and I chose their Artisan thin crust pizzas.  His was the Dorothea and Oven Roasted Tomato, made with this aged goat cheese that was to die for!!!  AAHHH!  Delicious!  I had the Brie Cheese with Truffle Oil pizza with sauteed wild mushrooms.  It was tasty, although nothing compared to the Dorothea goat cheese!  Mmmm!  All I can say about mine was that I wished it had more mushrooms on it, and possibly, more of my husband's goat cheese on it!  Hah!  Their woodfired pizza also offer different crusts from whole wheat, to even gluten-free.  The rest of the menu hosts a variety for every diet needs, from vegan to dairy-free selections to the most newest and finer ingredients that outshine most comparable restaurants of this style.

The service was excellent!  Our server was so friendly and polite with us.  She had even offered to bring out their \"Messy Sundae\" for our 5-year old daughter - it was her birthday dinner here!  We didn't even mention it to our server, but it was kind of her to suggest it!  Of course, it was birthday discounted, so that made it much more nicer of our server!

Although this place looks bar-sy, it's hard to believe that soo many families dine here!  We love it!  This is definitely our new family restaurant!  What's even better, is the fact that they have \"Happy Hour\" between 4pm and 6pm daily!  50% off of some of their menu items!  This is the reason why we are definitely making a return trip soon!"}
{"text":"**Summary**
       - Flavor - The pizza was average. Nothing gourmet.
       - Price - It just seemed from the menu that they were trying to squeeze every last penny out of you. For a pizza they had the following options: $1 more for whole what crust, $2 for artisan thin crust, $3 for gluten free and $2 for vegan cheese. It just seemed excessive.
**Ordered**
       - $12.50 New York Style Pizza - The pizza was decent but it just seemed over priced. It tasted just like domino's with the same toppings only greasier (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MW6hyPt6Xz6cIVyp_r1yLg?select=Pip7KP3jfZao0cKK_eK0EA).
**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't really recommend this place. It's ok food at above average prices."}
{"text":"The food is great. There are only two negatives 1.this is a very family/kid friendly place and can sometimes be loud 2.there are one or two semi-rude waiters. Otherwise Sammy's is great!!"}
{"text":"They changed their menu. When I asked the waiter if they changed their menu he gave me attitude and said, 'well if you have to ask then obviously we changed it.'  First off, I don't need attitude a nice yes let me tell you what is different, would have been better. 

The new menu isn't great. They took off some important items that I liked. The main problem I'm having is they changed their Caesar dressing (one of the reasons I used to go here) and they completely changed their pizza. The crust used to be delicious. Now it's mediocre at best. Their sauce was amazing. Now no flavor. They had good pepperoni and cheese. Not anymore. 

The final problem I have is they are picky about their couponing. Basically for two drinking water you can't get out of there for less than $30 with a coupon. Wait staff not as friendly as before. Prices are too high. And not food isn't good. Probably wont go back :/"}
{"text":"So I come in I got greeted with the Manager was super nice and offered my drink once u got sat, not once for almost being sat for 10 minutes tops! My server never came up to ask how I am or if I wanted to start with an appetizer just nothing and asked if I was ready to take my order. Normally I'm a patient person and totally understand if they're super busy but at least let me know that you'll be right with me or know I was acknowledged I was waiting. I've been in the food industry for almost 8 years and I've never pulled this especially if I ever did that I would be in trouble for having my guest wait that long. I would give them 3 stars for keeping up with my refills but at least have a good time at work and smile!"}
{"text":"Sammy's is a great place to go to Lunch, I have had the Fish Taco's the Chicken Pizza and the Asia Chicken Salad.  You need to  get to Sammy's before 12noon or you will have to wait for a table..

We have had a lot of luck with the staff, the service has been good each time we have gone there.

Try Sammy's"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Their pizza and salads are so good. There was five of us so we decided to order 3 salads and share since they are huge and ordered 2 woodfired pizza's (Margherita and Pepperoni). 

I really enjoyed the salad I picked: the Chilled Wild Mexican Shrimp. My sister ordered the Caesar salad which was average and the other one we ordered was the Red Quinoa which I wasn't crazy about. I didn't like the quinoa and it was kind of spicy but that is more my personal preference. Everyone else loved it but hands down everyone loved the Chilled Wild Mexican Shrimp. 

The pizza was good...nice and thin for the woodfired. I wonder how thin their thin pizza's are. I thought the pizza's would be a little bigger though but after eating the salads first, it was a good amount of pizza to eat...not too much. 

The service was good...friendly and attentive. The prices are reasonable too. 

The best part had to be the dessert: all five of us shared the Messy Sundae (vanilla ice cream covered in chocolate and caramel sauce with walnuts and whip cream). Soooo good. There was even some left over after all five of us digged in. However, the ice cream was put in this weird plastic like wine cup which made it kind of hard to get the ice cream out and the chocolate fudge on the bottom didn't make it easier because it made the cup slide. I would recommend they change the presentation of the sundae into a bowl to make it easier for sharing."}
{"text":"Sitting here trying to think of what to say in my review for Sammy's.   I've been close a few times to just closing it and revisiting it another day when it suddenly dawned on me:  my writer's block is BECAUSE of Sammy's.   Allow me to explain:

5 star reviews are easy because you just can't wait to spill your guts about your love for that place and you want to describe every component of your meal as if you were extolling the virtues of your children.  Vice versa for 1 star reviews: the hyperbole and metaphors just write themselves when the server ignores you for an hour or your $15 burger is ice cold in the middle.   3 stars though on yelp?  \"A-OK.\"  ?   Where's the fun in that? 

Sammy's delivers decent, but unspectacular food with good to great service with average value for your dollar.   -SLAP-  Wake up!

I go here once every few weeks because a friend of mine at work loves their Ahi Tuna burgers.   I've had them.  They're okay.  Yup.  \"A-OK\".   I've also tried their Mini Salmon Burgers, their mini kobe beef burgers, their white tuna and spinach salad, their chicken and hummus wrap, the Diavola pizza, and the Oak Roasted Salmon Filet.   They were all... you guessed it.  \"A-OK\".  Yaaaaaaaaaawwn.  Where was I?     Nothing has blown my mind.  Nothing has gotten me on the phone with the Clark County Health Department.   Everything has satisfied me (okay except the Salmon Filet because it was $16 and really not worth that), and unfortunately for the entertainment value of this review, nothing has offended me.   

They do give a discount for CSN employees (and maybe students?  I didnt ask because I don't really care), so props for that!   

So yeah, 3 stars.  If you made it to this part of the review, you deserve a compliment.   Go you!"}
{"text":"Finally a place in the Centennial Hills area that has good food AND good Happy Hour specials. I've ventured here with the family on more than one occasion and have never been disappointed. The last time I visited we had a rather large group and aside from some timing issues on delivering the entrees and the appetizers we all enjoyed it. They have a huge selection of appetizers ranging from duck tacos to coconut shrimp. It's all delicious! My personal favorite is the garlic cheese bread, which is simply a cut up cheese pizza without sauce. It is cheesy yummy goodness! The brie cheese pizza was tasty but spicy! I let my Mom try it and it burned her mouth. The waitress said that it's the oil that they coat the dough with prior to putting on the topping. I have tasted several other of the pizzas and all were delicious. The beet salad is also a fave. My girls like to eat the huge ice cream sundae. Not only is it huge, it is an undertaking fitting of 3 or more appetites. I'm not a huge dessert eater but the Sunday is a chocolate gooey masterpiece of indulgence that I just can't pass up! 

Their Happy Hour is half off apps and drinks!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my coworkers and the experience was awful. The only good thing I have to say is that the waiter was on the ball with drink refills. 

I ordered the Thai Chicken pizza and it was drowned in cilantro. The crust was thin and rubbery as was the cheese. The pizzas are all individual sized so they are somewhat pricey. It's not worth paying so much money for so little food when there are much better places like Mama Luigis and Grimaldi's near by."}
{"text":"I was craving pizza and didn't want to settle for the regular, doughy kind, I wanted a wood fire, thin crust pizza and we drove right by only to make the U-turn. 
We had been here a few times before, but to be truthful, couldn't recall what I had, but remembered I like it! A quick look at the pizza's and I knew it would be the spicy Italian sausage. 
When it arrived, it was very thin crust indeed, so thin, the juices from the sausage and mushrooms seemed to have melted through the crust, it was impossible to eat without a utensil. 
My hubby was trying to do right and keep to his diet, so he ordered the Caesar salad with chicken breast, it had to be the biggest salad, it was big enough for the two of us and then some!  
Overall, the staff was quick with the refills, friendly, the place smelled really good, and the pizza, well, I would definitely try again."}
{"text":"My favorite local spot. Originally visited for their great Happy Hour (Everyday from 3-6!) & have been coming ever since. On top of having great prices & food, the service has been amazing every time I've dined. Hopefully you get Alan or Casey - they've always been phenomenal! I have never had a bad experience. Definitely recommend this restaurant for any occasion."}
{"text":"We stopped in for early dinner. We had the crab & shrimp dip (half off), veggie pizza, chicken lettuce wraps and a kids pepp pizza. Place was a bit busy but not overly crowded. Our server was nice and pleasant.....was ok but a bit pricey. I'd rather have CPK IMHO."}
{"text":"I recently visited this location because an acquaintance told me they offered dairy free cheese with their pizza. Since discovering the health effects dairy has had on me, I have not eaten pizza in over a year. I was excited to try pizza again, and couldn't wait to try Sammy's.

I ordered the pepperoni pizza with dairy free cheese (and extra $2), and my fiance and I decided to share edamame since we were there during happy hour. If it was not happy hour, I probably would not have gotten the edamame, since they were originally $6. That just seems a little too expensive. 

The pizza was absolutely delicious, and it was my first time every having dairy free cheese. My fiance thought it was good, too. When it came time for dessert, we ordered the donuts (which do have powdered milk, but this doesn't seem to effect me like actual dairy does.) Those were okay, but came out lukewarm, instead of hot and fresh. It was a good way to end the night, but I would not go back and buy them again for $6.50.

Overall, I was impressed with this location and I'm excited to have found somewhere close by to try dairy-free pizza. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We needed to find something for breakfast before our flight, so we ended up here. 

We got the two breakfast pizzas that were very mediocre. The crust was thick, dry, and flavorless. The toppings were ok except the sausage. We ordered turkey sausage and this was one of those places that manages to find turkey sausage that tastes like dog food - dry and disgusting. I picked it off and ate the rest of the pizza. It was a good amount of food, so I took some of it to go. 

The service was incredibly slow. We had an hour before our flight boarded and by the time we paid our flight was boarding. The restaurant was pretty empty as well. 

I wouldn't recommend coming here. I'd go to Starbucks for breakfast next time instead."}
{"text":"Fast service.  Beautiful ambiance & decor.  I often call in a balsamic grilled chicken salad to go.  It's hearty, healthy and the balsamic dressing is one of the best I've had.  The chicken is always very tender & juicy.  I would say its a bit pricy for a salad though.  It's $12.00 so it's a splurge for me."}
{"text":"What's not to like about Sammy's? The sundae with melted chocolate and walnuts is to die for! The tomato basil soup is to one of the best in town and we like the margarita pizza and the \"New York\" I think it's called with all the meats pepperoni, sausage ext. and the salads are yummy too!"}
{"text":"There is not one bad dish on their menu. Go during happy hour and get crazy with their appetizers! 
Also their salad dressings are fresh and incredibly tasty."}
{"text":"Stellar. The Chicken Hummus Wrap will pretty much change your life. Usually airport food is blah and forgettable, I'm ordering one to go so I don't have to wait for my return flight home to Vegas to get another one."}
{"text":"Do not go here for lunch. Worst service. Our server was slow, forgetful, and didn't get my order correct. The place was practically empty during our time there and it didn't explain why the service is so terrible."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Ordered the lobster shrimp dip, mahi tacos and margherita pizza. I understand dip is suppose to be heavy but damn. Dip was full of grease. Taste was 5/10. Mahi tacos didnt have no taste. Pizza was their best thing. Ordered a beer aand ice tea. Total was around $60. 
Never again."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Saturday night and the salad was good but the service was terrible. I was never offered any bread barely got any refills and the waitress seem to be all over the place. When asked she said that they're understaffed and apologize which I understand but still for a $23 ceasar salad you should get good service and some bread."}
{"text":"Came in with no expectations ... after all it is midnight at the Las Vegas airport and sandwiches were $10 so I decided to sit by the bar and order the Greek Salad with Chicken for $13 and I was pleasantly surprised. Huge portion loaded with fresh veggies, tender chargrilled chicken, English cucumber, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini and feta crumbles. I didn't order anything else but the French fries looked very enticing. Last food order is at 12:15 am!!!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of having Sammys for lunch again today at work... I ordered the chile lime shrimp tacos.. All i have to say is Sammy you have  done it again. It was amazing, the shrimp was prepared perfect and the chile lime sauce was perfect. We will continue to return with food this good."}
{"text":"Okay Sammy... We need to talk about your place. The food was okay and the service, well the service was below par to be kind. Let me explain. 
We walked in around noon and could count all of the people in the restaurant on one hand and since the weather was awesome today \"mid 70's and a slight breeze\" we opted to sit outside and enjoy our lunch and the weather alike. The server sat us and was kind enough to let us know that if we decided to order pizza's it would be a little longer then normal because they just opened and the oven was not up to temp yet. That is totally understandable and i appreciate the warning. So we sat outside and decided on our order, closed the menus, finished our waters, and continued to sit. So about 15 minutes later the waiter came out and asked if we had decided, since we had plenty of time of coarse we said yes. We ordered a prosciutto asparagus pizza a kids BBQ Chicken pizza and I ordered a Grilled chicken breast and hummus sandwich. after another 15 to 20 minute wait we received our food. The sandwich I ordered was amazing and so were the other items we ordered but the lack of service and the constant empty drinks unfortunately were to much to overlook. The three stars are for the food being good and obviously the 2 docked stars are for the service, or lack there of. 
If you have the hankering for sammys i would recommend the W. Sahara Store over this one."}
{"text":"UPDATE! Since I've written this review (2010 incidentally...just recently dug it up and posted it, I'm sure a lot has changed since) Sammy's has changed the Fish Tacos to a tempting Grilled Hawaiian Ono served with a Chipotle Aioli Sauce. I'm sure any negative elements of my experience have long since been addressed. 

Here's my previous review. I'll update it as soon as I return! Thanks to General Manager Jay Hartwig for his quick insights!

The Review: So it was Mother's Day and due to some illness with the kids, we decided to order out for some fancy foodstuffs. We finally decided that maybe we'd give Sammy's another shot after writing them off several years ago due to not being too impressed with our experience.

After perusing the website (the kind of website with annoying music that doesn't give you an option to turn it off) we were excited to discover that Sammy's had FISH TACOS! Specifically Mahi Mahi tacos. Described as follows: Crispy Mahi Mahi Tacos with creamy tomato cilantro dressing, lime, guacamole and salsa with your choice of flour or corn tortillas.

Well I couldn't pass up this opportunity to further my explorations of the plane of existence that only fish tacos are privileged to permanently inhabit. But I digress. Let me tell you about my experience...

So after getting a busy signal a few times, I was finally lucky enough to get through only to wait about fifteen rings while worrying that they might be closed on Sunday following in the footsteps of their fellow local eateries. Upon eventually answering the phone, I was quick to order 2 orders of the Mahi tacos to go. My mind reeled momentarily when they asked if I wanted flour or corn, as this was a to-go order and I am no stranger to the short life span of a corn tortilla, when combined with fish and other assorted edibles. Yet I had to see....I had to know... so 2 corn and 2 flour, if you please. I was then asked if I wanted coleslaw or french fries with those. I know, right? Not exactly what I expected to hear, and honestly sent a sliver of dread up my spine for fear of my making a huge mistake. I then continued with ordering a couple more things off of the menu irrelevant to my literary endeavor, was told it would be ready in twenty minutes and bid adieu.

Twenty minutes later, I find myself looking for a place to park. Fast forward to standing in the bustling lobby, anxiously awaiting my wife's beet and arugula salad while my fish tacos (2 on corn tortillas) threaten to decompose by the minute in the huge clear plastic container that they mock me from. Salad's here! See ya....time to haul my ass home!

Aside from the environmentally catastrophic presentation, these things looked pretty good. It was also obvious that these were, for the most part, of the \"Do It Yourself\" variety. Fair enough. If they put salsa and guacamole in there and no chips to speak of, then apparently the condiments are intended for the tacos themselves. I felt inclined to oblige. I did notice something was missing though. The advertised \"creamy tomato cilantro dressing\". Bummer. I was somewhat looking forward to what they might have had to offer in that category. Needless to say, this posed a situation for the fish. Because now there was no hiding under some fancy sauce.

I started with the corn tortilla taco first, due to the fact that the disintegration had already begun and because I didn't want to be forced to use a fork (For a taco? Bastards. Never.)

Every bite of this particular taco was delicious yet awkward. The corn tortilla barely made it. I found it hard to focus on the particulars of this one due to all my thought processes going to keeping that thing together. On to the flour tortilla taco...

Guacamole, pico de gallo, red cabbage, a squeeze of a juicy lime, a crunchy perfectly cooked piece of Mahi Mahi and a not too crispy, not too soggy flour tortilla equaled easy to handle deliciousness in every bite.

Well done Sammy's, well done.

Although how can I rate this first experience with this establishment's fish tacos when an apparent crucial ingredient, that was so proudly included in it's description, was neglected to be added to these tacos at all? I believe I have to review these again, which I don't think I'd mind. Although with being so impressed with the sauce-less tacos, how will I enjoy them when they do decide to add sauce? Will the sauce ruin them? Or will they just take those things to the next level? I'm not sure I like being in this position. Either way, part 2 of Sammy's will most likely be shorter.

I would definitely recommend these for the people who like a fish taco with breaded fish. The corn tortillas would be sublime for dine-in, but for take-out I would recommended the flour. Actually, I don't think I'll ever order corn tortillas again for my fish tacos if I'm ordering to-go from anywhere. 

3 thumbs up for the sauce less version..."}
{"text":"Delicious Margherita woodfired veggie pizza. Service n dining was good. (location near D6 gate)"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been on here, but just an update, Sammy's has redeemed themselves over and over these last two years. 
My FIL got us started on there happy hour specials. My daughters LOVE their potstickers, and I love the chicken satay (but prefer to dip them in the potsticker sauce). My FIL raves about the duck tacos, husband loves the pizza (they have a great GF crust) 
And they have a sundae the size of your head."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic but the wait staff is less then satisfactory. It appeared that the lady that was waiting on us was waiting tables for the first time.  She all but forgot about us.  When asked if she could fill my wife's cup with ice, she refused saying she really couldn't and ran off to another table.  We left a tip but far below the 20% standard."}
{"text":"People seem to love Sammy's. They have quite a list of salads and single-person-sized pizzas on their menu, among other items.  If you check out the photo on the website the place seems to have a nice, warm and cozy feel, but I didn't find that to be the case at all- at least at this location.  Instead I found the decor to be extremely faux and the hearth-like atmosphere to be superficial- no warmth at all for me.  But the space is clean and inviting, the food is good and the service was fine.  No real complaints."}
{"text":"Great 24 hour menu with everything from tapas to pizza to supped up bar food choices.  They have a happy hour from 4pm-7pm and 12am to 8am where the drinks are 2 for 1 and all tapas is half price.  I can't think of another place that offers kobe beef hummus can you?

The pizza wasn't bad but not one of the best in Vegas.  I do like that they offer fat free mozzerella as a choice.  The thin crust pizzas tasted better than the wood fired ones.  They have a TON of different cheeses for pizza including gouda, goat and bulgarian cheese.   

The atmosphere is nothing to go crazy about...standard small bar but who cares with a menu like this?

I am definitely going back here for late night dinner."}
{"text":"Eating some breakfat/lunch after an LV bender.

Main points:
- Service not attentive
- Hostess kept leaving stand and people were left waiting to get a table
- Multiple times my table was passed by server with no acknowledgement

The pizza was A-OK so 3* earned but this was from a May visit."}
{"text":"First time here.  Overall my family had a good experience here.  There weren't many people here when we came here for lunch on a Saturday.  Service was pretty good and the food arrived in quick order.  The pizzas that we ordered were good.  Not too much negative about the experience here."}
{"text":"I just had the breakfast pizza vegetarian style without the bacon and instead opted for fresh spinach and it was actually incredible! I am so pleased with this place, it made my morning. The server Janet was very kind and really good at her job. The pizza was so tasty, even better than it looked, and it was a nice looking pizza. I love pizza but came in expecting the usual airport bleck but I was pleasantly surprised by both the quality of the food and the excellent service. Thanks Sammy's for your airport food redemption, I'll stop in anytime I fly out of LAS and stop into one of your regular locations when I get back into town."}
{"text":"The duck tacos are my favorite but they have a lot of really good appetizers. The good thing is that they are open 24 hours too."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the service wasn't spectacular. Server took forever to bring our checks and when she did, she rang them up on the same card instead of splitting them. We also had to ask for things numerous times and it was not a busy afternoon by any means"}
{"text":"Came here for a late Mother's Day Dinner with my bf & his parents since his mom was craving their Shrimp Angel Hair Pasta. There was barely anyone in the restaurant so we were seated right away!

We decided to order the Arugula Salad, Lobster Bisque, Tomato Basil Soup, (2) Shrimp Angel Hair Pastas and the Flourless Chocolate Cake for dessert. There was a couple of things we complained about during our visit: first, the soups came out pretty cold. We asked our server if it could be heated up but they were nice enough to bring us a fresh and hot new soup. Second, our server was barely around our entire dinner and didn't even offer us bread with our soups. We had to ask other servers who walked near our table for refills and other requests. Third, the two pastas were lacking sauce and were very dry. We had to ask for extra sauce on the side and thankfully they brought out a big bowl of sauce for us to put on our pastas which definitely helped. However, throughout most of the meal I had to keep adding salt and Parmesan cheese to mask this \"dishwater\" taste the pasta had. 

I did enjoy their arugula salad which was a huge portion for 4 people to share, even though we ordered a small which was great. I wish our experience was better, especially considering the price we paid. You can find better meals and better service at a much lower price elsewhere."}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch here recently and enjoyed it.  This is near her house so its a good spot if we are not in a casino.  I had the ORGANIC ARUGULA & PEAR pizza with Prosciutto, Gorgonzola, organic arugula salad tossed in Balsamic Basil dressing.  It was very good.  Loved the salad on top.  There was plenty of pears and cheese too.  Mom had the pepperoni pizza.  She enjoyed it.  They have good thin crust.  I actually ate my whole pizza which means I really liked it.  Our waiter was relatively attentive.  Took a bit of time to get drink refills but otherwise she was fine.

They have changed their menu a bit to focus more on tapas.  It looked like there were some good options that I will try next time."}
{"text":"I didn't even look at the reviews before coming here, and I'm glad I didn't because I don't think I would have stopped in. Yelp gives this place such a bad rep, but I personally had a pretty good experience. 

Service was good, my bloody mary was good if not expensive (but what drink isn't expensive at an airport?), and honestly the pizza was great! I'm unsure if it is, but it definitely seemed fresh-made to me - the crust was thin but still soft-ish, and all of the toppings seemed fresh. It was super delicious. I don't remember it taking particularly long to get my food, but I also wasn't in any sort of hurry; I don't think this place would be a good option if you need to \"grab and go\". My server was very friendly and attentive, and served my food to me boxed up since I said I'd only eat a piece or two and then take the rest to go with me. 

I would definitely go back again, but only if I was sure I had an hour or so to chill out and enjoy my food."}
{"text":"Love Sammy's. This was my first time at this location and the first time at Sammy's for lunch. It was very crowded, but I didn't have to wait. I had the chicken chopped which was delicious as always. I couldn't eat 1/2 of it because there was so much. One person with us had a pizza. I don't remember which one, but it was tasty. I usually have the BBQ pizza which is GREAT. Another friend had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp was delicious. I'm not so sure about the grits. The texture was more like polenta.  If it really is polenta, they should call it Shrimp and Polenta. If they really are using grits, they definitely need to find a better way to cook them. Overall though, it was a good experience. Service was really good."}
{"text":"While the $10 lunch is a good idea, someone needs to revisit the arugula to dressing ratio. My salad sounded delicious on the menu, all the ingredients blended well together, until they got completely drowned in the dressing. I highly recommend ordering the dressing on the side."}
{"text":"Ordered a coke and received 3 different glasses of brownish water. I ordered the double cheeseburger and 1 of the patties was raw. The manager offered to deduct the coke, are you kidding me. The waitress obviously didn't expect a tip maybe thats why we only saw her twice the entire time. I will never eat here again and I suggest you don't either."}
{"text":"Got sick from the food pizza is all we ordered (margarita )  server tried to put other peoples drinks on our non alcohol bill. So disappointed"}
{"text":"Being located in the airport doesn't give a restaurant an excuse to be beyond horrible. Serving rotten fruit as a side dish to a breakfast burrito is embarrassing. Food was rancid, it actually makes me angry. This place got our $40 for breakfast, don't let them get yours. Close this place down, what a pit."}
{"text":"Okay, I am going to try to be non-bias when it comes to pizza. I am far from a west coaster, and I told by more than most west coast pizza and \"real\" east coast pizza is completely different.  with that said, my server was fabulous, very attentive and made sure my guest and I have refills and checked on us a few times. 
Now about the pizza, it was good for the price.  you could tell it was a chain pizza eatery as the pepperoni was bagged and the cheese was just cheese.  
As this would not be my \"1st\" place to go for real pizza, I would not argue with my friends if I had to go back. 
I did my re heat test and it was not as good as it was the first time. :("}
{"text":"The chopped chicken salad is $$$$$
The hummus is tasty and well prepared.
The pizzas are adequate size and tasty. 

The service is good and the have a nice clean place.   Nothing is spectacular but nothing to complain about.  The food is solid and consistent with no surprises.  It is a great lunch spot and you can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"The pizza looked good, but I wouldn't know because after sitting at a table for about fifteen minutes without even a drink order being taken, I got up and went to California Pizza Kitchen."}
{"text":"Went to Sammy's last night with friends and kids, 10 people. They had a nice round table that we fit nicely around.  The restaurant was quiet at 5 p.m when we went and the waitstaff were nice to the kids. It was happy hour so all the appetizers were half-off; I am assuming the drinks were to, but I did not have a drink. The food was really good.  The lettuce wraps were amazing.  I also had the balsamic chicken salad which was uber tasty.  The kids cleared their plates, which is always a good sign.  Would definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, either at 3pm or 3am! The drinks are great, food is always awesome, gotta check out happy hour with 50% off appetizers I get almost all of them. Love the tofu, shishito peppers, hummus & baba ganush. I love all the salads, the chicken entree is amazing, and my hubby always enjoys the kobe beef burgers."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with nice service as well as a clean environment. We frequent this place and we crave it more than our body needs...highly recommend as I believe they are the best pizza in town! This place is good for first dates and kids as well!"}
{"text":"Vegas is my hometown, and one of my favorites places to frequent was Sammy's Woodfired Pizza. Upon my last trip back home (this last weekend), I was wanting to hit some of my favorite spots, but didn't get to. To my surprise (and delight), there was a Sammy's right next to my departure gate at McCarran (D Gates, Terminal 1)! I also had an hour to kill, so it was like kismet. Or fate. Or whatever. 

SERVICE: It's Christmastime, they were busy, I get it - but first off I have to say the service was lacking. They actually weren't THAT busy, but maybe they were slammed earlier and so they were over it, I don't know. First off, I noticed the host wasn't very attentive to the stand when people were waiting to be seated. I was one of them. My server was the worst though. She looked like she had not smiled in years. I tried to be as polite and easy-going with my few needs (pizza & wine), it's the Holidays, but not once she did she smile, welcome me, thank me, anything! Maybe these are little gestures, but that's just it! They are LITTLE gestures that go a long way. She almost made me uncomfortable they way she stared at me while I ordered. I was sitting next to a couple I also heard complain that the busser came and took his plate away before asking if he was finished - which he wasn't and asked for his side dishes back.

(side note: I overheard my waitress chatting bitterly with the host at a nearby server station about how \"they don't know what they are doing and messing up our schedules\" so I am guessing there are some management issues.)

FOOD: The food & wine I ordered, however, delicious! I ordered a small Chardonnay (to try it, it was good, so I ordered a bigger one after that. What? I wasn't flying the plane). I also ordered the New York Style pizza - yum status. A bit bummed that they didn't have the Gluten Free crust options like I had heard the other Sammy's do, but I figured that was maybe due to airport location, size of menu, etc. I actually didn't feel bloated or sick after eating the crust as I do most often with pizza dough, so I was a happy camper. I scarfed the whole thing down along with my wine and hopped onto my plane home. 

So, that's why the 3 stars.

If my experience had to be Christmas-ized, the food was like a gift from Santa, the service was like a visit from the Grinch!

***Wish they had a Sammy's in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"I love the LaDou's BBQ chicken pizza, the balsamic grilled chicken salad and the messy sundae. They have an amazing tapa's menu with Baba ghanoush, duck tacos, chicken satay, etc. I have dined and carried out at this location since 2002. I have never been disappointed by the product or service."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for a while and I have always been a fan. Since I haven't been in a while, we stopped in to eat at this location yesterday. 

When we entered, the room is large with a lot of tables. It was well past lunchtime so there were very few people dining. Our server was very kind and provided some helpful guidance in terms of which pizza to order. I must admit I am not too adventurous when it comes to my pizza. I prefer it basic with pepperoni, but I was in the mood to try something new. Not only do they offer pizza here but there are also some creative salads and pasta dishes as well.

We selected the Burrata/Pesto pizza(our servers favorite) the Brie cheese with truffle oil and the Sicilian. In addition, we ordered the chicken salad. The chicken salad was really tasty with a delicious vinaigrette dressing. The tomatoes were fresh and juicy and on this hot day overall the salad was refreshing. The pizza was interesting. I enjoyed the added taste from the pesto but didn't really care for the burrata. It didn't enhance the overall flavor of the pizza for me. The Sicilian was loaded with Italian sausage, bell peppers, onions, red peppers and it was yummy. The Brie cheese pizza with truffle oil was probably the least liked pizza of all. Not a whole lot of flavor here. Of course we had to leave room for the Messy Sundae which we all shared and it never fails to please. The service was excellent and I really appreciated how attentive our server was. 

In the food world where there are always new dishes, pizzas, salads, burritos etc to try, I will stick to being a pepperoni pizza lover! Good enough for me!"}
{"text":"This is my ultimate favorite pizza spot , from the delicious ! Pizza . to they're warm good pita bread with hummus , they're Parmesan fries with good burgers too . Great menu and to top it off ! They're signature messy sundae ! Is to die for . Super clean , well organized ,great customer service and nice restaurant set up . Love this place ! Worth every penny"}
{"text":"This place is garbage.  Every few years I end up here for some reason and by the end of the meal every time I think to myself, \"why did I come back here?\"

The epitome of bad chain-restaurant food.  Their namesake pizza is all dough and the crust is soft.  Crust should be crusty, not like a big slab of white bread.

The menu is a bland sampling of everything popular at other restaurants.  Tapas?  Really?  Those are not tapas.  They're appetizers.  Chicken Lettuce Wraps stolen from Pf Chang are not tapas.  Garlic bread, dumplings, baba ghanoush, thai chicken skewers.  What the hell is this menu?  These are appetizers, not tapas.  Also this is a crappy, bready-ass pizza place with wilted lettuce salads and bottled dressings and surely no real chef anywhere near the kitchen.

They want to please all of the suburban happy-hour housewives out there sipping an overpriced glass of grocery-store chardonnay so they lay out every bs thing that is trendy on someone else's menu.  Sliders and tapas and wraps and hummus and chicken lettuce wraps and pizza and tacos and burgers and doughnuts.  Enough.

If you want sliders, hit slidin thru.  If you want tapas, go to Firefly.  If you have a hankering for pizza, go to Settebello or Aurelio's or Due Forni.  Hungry for tacos?  Los Tacos or Tacos El Gordo.  This place specializes in bad renditions of food done way better elsewhere, made for people who don't know any better or don't care.

Just do one thing well!  Your namesake pizza is a disgrace.  Start there.

Another warning sign of a crummy restaurant is when you see trademark signs after their menu items.  Welcome to Chili's or Applebee's or Sammy's or whatever other pre-made frozen garbage restaurant with sauces that show up at the backdoor every monday in a  bag.  Everything heated up to order!

Bleccch.

So bad I get mad."}
{"text":"Went for lunch here on a whim and enjoyed our meal. 

Nice selection on the menu with a variety of flavors and vegetarian meals.

Started with the Crab, Shrimp, and Artichoke Dip. GF's choice...I thought I would hate it. Turned out to be my favorite part of the meal. Topped with bubbly Romano cheese and served with herb rubbed pita bread. I really loved this. Oh ya and it had huge chunks of soft and sweet garlic.

We shared the Sun-dried Tomato and Goat Cheese Pizza w/ Pine Nuts. This was also very good but kinda small. Also shared a Beef Skewer Salad. Nice amount of beef ( 6 skewers ) but not much else that was that good...some lettuce, peanuts, bean sprouts, and grilled pineapple ( probably made the whole salad worth it ). The salad was $15.99 and just OK. But is was pretty big. 

Next time probably skip the salad and order the one I know I like ( Thai peanut ), or another entree. 

Good for for a decent price. Service was good and tea was great. ( iced passion un-sweetened. ) Nice outside seating also."}
{"text":"Omg amazing food inside an airport?! The Cesar salad was so fresh and tasty! And the goat cheese pizza. Every bite was amazing"}
{"text":"Best chicken caesar ever.  I can have a piece of chicken with every bite and the salad will run out before the chicken.  

Only down side is with tax the salad is over $20"}
{"text":"Always a 5 star for Sammy's. The food isn't gourmet but it's still great for the price.  A great selection of wines and beers and their happy hour is Half Off Tappas! I went too far tonight. I couldn't even write my review until I recouped.  Duck tacos are always my favorite and this time it was the first thing that rolled off my tongue! The chicken lettuce wraps which I have recreated their version at my own home and the shrimp crab dip. With a $5 glass of a nice crisp Chardonnay I was in my Thursday I've almost made it heaven.  We ordered some hummus and of course my friends birthday had to end with the ultimate Share the \"Messy Sunday\" ! A tall generous wine goblet lined with gooey caramel, fudge and walnuts. The caramel is used as a glue to keep the glass adhered to the plate. They fill it with a selfish vanilla ice cream and top it with a mountain of whipped cream and then drown the whole thing off with the fudge and nuts which covers and saturates over the delicious caramel. Scrape the sides of the glass the gooey bites are addicting.  This location has my favorite server Allen. He is super nice and informative and just good and the right amount of attention.  Half off happy hours and great food to boot.  Check me out its worth the visit !"}
{"text":"Good family restaurant w/gr8 gluten-free menu.  Variety of standard dishes.  I like the shrimp salad, gluten-free pasta, tomato soup, margarita pizza, duck tacos, tapas and drink selection.  The food isn't gourmet but it's well prepared, amble and the service is good.  Prices are decent and the place is spacious.  Menu is always changing."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, excellent food, an overall enjoyable experience! My favorite is the chicken and hummus wrap! I could consume that for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner everyday! I get cucumbers as my side instead of fries and they are always so crisp and fresh! My husband gets the Kobe sliders. I got a little jealous of the sliders when I saw the satisfaction on his face. Beverages are never empty, which is a big one for us! 

Don't be fooled by the \"pizza\" in true name. This ISN'T a pizzeria! Although there pizza is delicious, they have so many other options!"}
{"text":"Mando was an excellent server! Food was decent. My friends had pizza and I ate the Greek salad."}
{"text":"If you get the chance, don't eat there.  

I had  the BBQ pizza - eh.  My wife had the chipotle cheese chicken tacos - which were disgusting to look at, never mind eat. The cheese was huge chunks, not melted and the colors of all of the ingredients were muted (not and adjective I'd like to use when discussing food).

Out waiter was just plain awkward - making jokes that were playfully sarcastic, but inappropriate for any dining environment - chain restaurant or not. 

The experience furthered my belief that chain restaurants should be avoided at all costs."}
{"text":"The place is bomb. 
I was really happy with this place. 
Clean. !!
Our server Danny was nice. 
I highly recommend this place and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The Food its ok but the service its awful. Wrong food, inappropriate jokes,etc. Bad place  at least to me. I'm not coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"New transplant to Vegas and neighbor to Sammy's.  Was excited to try some awesome wood fired pizza. Lady and I were excited to get some pizza. We enters and were greeted by our server who was awesome and sat us. After perusing the menu and learning their pizzas are $13 and ape are $8-11 we simply wanted to try their food without diving head first. We ordered the truffle fries and a \"Hawaiian\" pizza. The fries came out and were delicious, he'll they're truffle fries. The pizza came out moments later. Let me reiterate this is a $13 personal size pan pizza so our expectations were high. What we received was a cheese overloaded wood fired crust pizza that left us wanting nothing to do with Sammy's pizza. The pineapple was sliced so thin i honestly don't know how they get it that thin. With the overpriced mediocre pizza we left and went to the neighboring chipotle. The ambiance and menu is appealing but the pizza left so much to be desired. I cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ate here on Saturday 5-28-16 around 1PM. $48.67 got us a salad, an appetizer, some tacos, two drinks, and a messy sundae.    

The menu seems to have changed since the last time I came...they are trying out tapas now and have a huge variety...everything from edamame to baba ghanoush.  I think they are trying too hard with these new menu items.  Just stick to what you're good at, Sammy's.  (Pizza and salad) 

Speaking of, I had the greek salad and it was truly wonderful.  It was fresh and had plenty of baby persian cucumbers, feta cheese, olives, red onions, tomatoes, and pepperoncini. It came already dressed in just the right amount of house dressing.  They make a damn good salad! 

I had an appetizer as my main course...I had the seasoned shredded beef empanadas which had dried currants, onions, and spicy salsa verde on the side for dipping.  The crust was nice but the filling was bizarre...the cumin was overpowering and the dried currants were a strange addition...like tiny little raisins.  I can't recommend this dish at all.  

The best part of the meal should have been the messy sundae.  Unfortunately the ice cream was freezer-burned and hard as a rock.  

Food took foooreverrrrrr to come out. I asked the waiter, \"Will my pizza be long?\" and he replied, \"No, ma'am, it will be round.\"   HAHAHAAHAHAH All kidding aside, I have no urge to go back.  Seriously."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this place...perhaps because pizza to me is pizza. Bread and sauce and toppings, it's the same to me. I guess I've been trying to look for a pizza that will blow me away. Apparently this place did not hit the spot. Just another plain jane in all the pizza I've had.

The waiter seemed quite aloof. I asked for bread and then 10 minutes passed and I had to ask again. Same to refilling the waters.

Pizza was pretty bland and not all impressed."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding food! Their pizza is perfect every time. My favorite dish is the duck tacos, absolutely phenomenal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the neighborhood looking for something to eat for dinner.  I saw on Yelp that Sammy's was nearby, and was also surprised that it only had three and a half stars.  We have a Sammy's by our house and love it!  Let me just say, I am not surprised anymore.  We walked in around 6:30... It should have been packed.  The one by our house always is for dinner, especially on a Saturday night.  It was dead, but we already knew we liked the food, and figured the wait wouldn't be long since they weren't busy.  WRONG.

We never got to eat the food, because we didn't even order.  We sat there, in the empty restaurant for over 10 minutes, and weren't even looked at by the four waiters and waitresses just hanging out in the kitchen.  The manager was standing off to the side of the kitchen, chatting it up with yet another waiter.  Eventually, a waiter came by once he was flagged down by another table.  He walked by us twice, without even a glance.  Granted, he may not have been assigned to our table.  Then, the manager walks the room.  She gives us a quick glance, and keeps walking back to the kitchen where all of the wait staff is having a grand time.

At this point, my husband and I are out.  The manager sees us heading toward the door, runs after us, and asks us if she can help with anything.  Uh, yeah... How about a waiter or waitress?  We tell her why we are leaving, and she asks if she can take our order, drink order.  Uh, yeah, NO.  If you think I'm exaggerating, there were three other tables occupied in the whole restaurant.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I ordered a Hawaiian pizza here and was unimpressed.  I got thin crust ($2 extra, BTW) and it was so soggy, it was almost like a tortilla.  All the ingredients slid off and it was a mess to eat.  I ordered the same thing at CPK a couple days ago and it was much better, so I know it can be done well.  Kind of pricey, so I won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife must eat a gluten free diet. We ordered a gluten free garlic chicken pizza for my wife and a New York Style pizza for me. The best pizzas from NYC always have olives so I asked for them to be added. My wife was very happily with her pizza; I thought mine was nothing short of how pizza should taste. Excellent food, excellent service."}
{"text":"Very short review - it's and airport and you get the level of service and quality you have come to expect from a major air terminal.

Food is \"good\". And service is \"ok\""}
{"text":"My husband and I live in the area and have never been. We finally decided today after reading the menu online. Then we realized that they had a happy hour. We took our little one and sat outside. Half priced tapas and $2 off wine and beer between 4-6 every day. Fantastic!

So this location's outdoor dining faces the parking lot but honestly... It did not matter. The food was wonderful and our service was impeccable. The gentleman who took care of us was great and had great recommendations. 

We are so happy to have finally stumbled upon Sammy's. Great happy hour close by that does not consist of smokey bars and fried food??  This is a great place to be able to go with our girl. I also love that they had an option of carrot sticks with hummus for her to snack on. We will see you all again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The gluten-free crust is phenomenal! It is corn-free too (just in case you're also allergic to corn, like me). The staff was very knowledgeable about the menu, and they made it easy to figure out which foods I could eat."}
{"text":"Came here in hopes for a good dinner when I saw the average rating was 4 stars.

Ordered the hummus (too oily), balsamic chicken salad (drowning in dressing luckily chicken was savable), coconut shrimp (decent can't really mess up anything fried), fish tacos (blah, not worth ordering).

Although my dinner date believes this review deserves 3 stars, I defer not. He needs to get a yelp account and stop back seat yelping lol.

customer service needs to tighten up... it wasn't even busy. 

Not for me.

Waste of money."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the location depressed me. 
Nothing really stood out about this particular Sammys.
Half of the time I didn't even know this location existed because it was soooo tucked away into some lot.
I always get the pizza and a chopped salad.
Service is good.
Location just sucks."}
{"text":"Stopped in while I was waiting for my tire to be changed at Discount tire which is across the street. What a great place! I was pleasantly surprised. Great happy hour great prices and the truffle fries, mahi tacos and the Kobe sliders with Gorgonzola cheese OMG! So good. The portions are large and very well priced. I will be back for sure! Our waitress Sherry G was fabulous."}
{"text":"First time in this week.  It was clean inside , greeted and seated right away. The menu was simple not too overwhelming like other places, prices mid range but fair. I got the five cheese pizza which I was a little nervous about being too much cheese but it was very very good and hit the spot. They have a nice meat and cheese sampler on the appetizer menu that I liked but a little pricey at  $16 for it. Staff was nice and attentive,  my only question was why was the place so empty at 630 on a weeknight  it's prime dining time. Only about 5 tables of guests out of 30 or so and plenty of outside seating available as well. I'll return again for at least take out..worth a try."}
{"text":"We came in at 1am and I wasn't expecting much.   My bf works odd hours and he and his friends come here on occasion because they like the late night happy hour.   I was skeptical. 

And of course I was wrong!  I was fully surprised at how good the food was for that time of day and for that price.  Late night happy hours usually mean getting rid of the bad stuff but everything tasted fresh and delicious. 

I think I might be obsessed with the duck tacos.   Perfect balance of flavors and textures.   I also really liked the baba ganoush a lot.   It might be one of my favorites I've ever had. 

The service was pretty good for just one bartender working.   One of the runners or cooks came out with him to help carry our food and knocked over a water glass.  Very quick to remedy the situation.   I really appreciated that. 

Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I wish service was better and my pizza was not burnt. Sad thing is I was so hungry I ate it with no complaints."}
{"text":"This is another local place I wanted to try and actually I found out about them thru an ad online, it you go to their website and sign up for email offers they are pretty good deals. I like their pizzas because they are woodfire cooked, those pizzas always seem to have a lot better tastes than the traditional oven based cooking, also they have a good salad as well, something about pizza and salad going together makes it takes better. The service was average could have been a-little more attentive to the drinks as the are were getting empty. I am believer that servers need to make sure drinks are always filled, or at least checked on frequently."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch! Food so fresh and perfectly seasoned!
we shared the hummas sampler and it was so good we got one to go. The pesto chix wrap was awesome the cole slaw side was so fresh and tasty. My mahi mahi tacos were to great grilled perfectly and just the right amount of spice. And the service was spot on! Manger was so sweet and friendly. You earned my business, we will be back."}
{"text":"Well, \"Yay\" I WAS a fan.   As regulars who visit this Sammy's 1-2  times a week so we can sit at the bar, have our wine and visit with the awesome manager and staff, I guess all good things do pass. Our favorite manager is gone, awesome staff is slowly dwindling, no fault of their own, and soon no table service?
The higher ups at Sammy made some decisions that we don't understand, Everything that we visit Sammys for will be gone, thrown out like garbage.
I guess it's turning in to the same 'walk up order and go sit down' venue like all the rest around us. This end of town is lacking in decent restaurants where you can sit down and relax WITHOUT the cigarette smoke, and Mr. Sammy just made it worse. Not sure if we are going back. Very sad."}
{"text":"This is the best neighborhood joint.  Such nice staff. Got greeted immediately and had a nice server named Samantha.  We didn't even realize that they had a happy hour since we haven't been here in awhile but we came at the right time (3-6pm every day) and got the duck tacos (AMAZING!) baba ganoush (sp? Haha) & the Japanese meatballs.  Such a good little tapas stop.  
Glad we revisited this place after not having stopped back in awhile. Forgot they had all these amazing options besides pizza.  

*** please remember to tip on the total amount  before the discount was taken out.  They're giving us a discount so let's repay the \"happy hour\" by making the server happy and tipping them on what they would have gotten before the discount was applied! ***"}
{"text":"We used to come her about once a month, then they changed their menu.  Food had usually been good, so we thought we would give them another try.  
Waiter never told us it was happy hour, even though it was 5:30.  Service was slow.  Had to ask twice for water.  Near the end of the meal, he finally brought a carafe for the table.
We ordered grilled mahi mahi tacos and a Chinese chicken salad.
The taco shells were greasy and soggy.  The fish was not seasoned and had little flavor.  Tacos were supposed to have avocado on them.  Mine had a pea sized piece of avocado.  I was unable to pick them up, as they were so greasy.  $12.25 and we only received 2 tacos with very little filling.

The salad had good flavor, however there were only 4 or 5 very small pieces of chicken.  I had to search for it.  Salad would have been better had they used fresh oranges instead of canned.

Very disappointed this visit.  There are too many restaurants in the area.  We won't be in a hurry to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequently visit Sammie's on Sahara about 4 times a week,  considering we are night owls we spend most of our time in the tavern. We really enjoy the bar staff! Cher and Kat  always remember our drink orders, make us feel welcome and immediately ask us if we want to order any food. We are always informed about the current player promotions and really enjoy spending our Free time at Sammie's with them. 
I suggest that everyone goes to Sammie's has a drink and orders the hummus!"}
{"text":"I found this place when renting a car from the place next door.

The All-Natural Pepperoni pizza is so tasty and delicious. The service is excellent and friendly.


Note: 
While our family like this place and our child cannot get enough of their pizza, I highly recommend you always checking for yourself and making your own opinion when reading reviews--all reviews, especially filtered by Yelp as not recommended. You need to scroll down to the bottom of all reviews and click on \"xx other reviews currently not recommended\" to be able to read reviews hidden by Yelp."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped recently for lunch.  She ordered the chicken wrap; me the Chinese chicken salad.  It took nearly 30 minutes to get the order filled.  Waitress apologized.  Said the chicken was being fresh cooked.  Manager finally came by and offered us a free tapas to ease the wait (nice touch).  But when dishes finally arrived, I found about 5 pieces of chicken in my heaping salad that taste wise had been compromised by an over generous drenching of some kind of dressing (sesame oil, I think) that produced more heat than taste.  Wife's wrap was more robust with chicken, but not noticeably fresh cooked.  Overall, a poor experience."}
{"text":"My sister and I call Sammy's \"the usual\" simply bc you CAN NEVER go wrong!
Usually when she and I go we get and split the goat cheese pizza and Greek salad..... Or the vegetarian pizza (add goat cheese).
I'm so obsessed that I go on weekends to get the Greek salad or my NEW favorite the chicken chopped salad with kalamata olives & a tropical iced tea! 
It's casual w/ upscale flavor ..... I don't find their prices high.... It's just too damn good to consider. Ha. We take family here when they come to town and it's a good spot for business meetings too!
Good ol' faithful Sammy's......... I think I might just go pick up said salad tomorrow for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place sucks our serve Monique was so freaking rude it look 30 mins just to get a server and the only thing she could say was \"I JUST GOT HER\" is that our fault or yours THIS PLACE SUCKS"}
{"text":"The Hawaiian grilled Mabo tacos are delicious and to die for, got a little kick of jalapeños that are still stinging my mouth as I type this review lol"}
{"text":"Went to Sammy's on a Friday night at 7:45. It was about 70% full and we we were seated immediately . Our server was excellent , super friendly but she was one of only 2 servers working the shift. She said ' management' let the other servers go home. I guess they're running things as lean as possible. I would question the wisdom of this policy. With slightly brisker service we would have ordered more drinks etc, multiply a few drinks by a few tables and you surely make more profit than you would save by sending home a couple of servers an hour early. The manager here is clearly not seeing the bigger picture. 

Anyway the food; We started with Kobe Skewers and Edamame , both excellent . Kids had quesadilla and noodles with grilled chicken. Both veery good indeed. I had chicken pizza on Artisan Crust , very light and tasty. I would recommend but I don't know how they charge $2 extra for the crust . There are many gluten free options on the menu which should suit the followers of Americas latest dietary \"trend\". 

Overall a good restaurant , not cheap but good food , ambiance , staff , convenient . Worth a look!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time tonight and it was an awesome choice! My husband and I both got pizza. It seemed like they had a little bit of everything on the menu. the pizza was amazing! Really unique flavor combinations, which I love! Not your mama's pizza! My husband said it was the best bbq chicken pizza he's had and he tries that almost anywhere we go! We were impressed and will definitely be back again and again...and again!"}
{"text":"Despite being in an airport this place great. I tried the balsamic grilled chicken salad and it was a treat. Huge salad, perfectly cooked chicken, and great bar tender. If you have an hour layover it's a nice spot."}
{"text":"First - service was amazing.  The waitress was 'on it' - we were a large group - and the owner (?) manager (?) came over to check on us several times.  I always appreciate that.  We were a bunch of moms with babies/toddlers.  

Second- Caesar salad was FRESH.   Nothing better then a nice crisp salad on a hot summer day.   Would have paired perfect with sparkling wine/champagne.  But I was driving w/ baby... 

Third- Personal pizza size is HUGE and can easily feed 2 folks.   Pizza was good but not great; I do not understand this fascination with adding so much sugar to pizza.  Is this America now?  Are we so addicted to sugar we add it in excessive amounts to our pizzas?  

Finally - the Donut desert was super delish.   

I will go back."}
{"text":"On a scale of 1 to 10, the Chilled roasted veggie salad was a solid 11.   Loved the combination of flavors and the dressing was excellent. GF menu. Pretty good GF pizza.  Good wheat crust pizza. Very good coconut shrimp skewers. Love their commitment to sustainability. There was an issue with presenting the free pizza coupon on my smart phone, but they made an exception and took care of it.  loved that it was nice and mellow in there: nice break from the typical Vegas experience.  Worth the 10 minute drive from downtown.  Great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This is my first review for this branch of Sammy's.  We've been here many times before, so it's unfortunate for them that I chose to review it this time.

The last few visit to Sammy's have been at their Centennial and Flamingo locations, and I raved about it.  This time wasn't such a fortuitous event.  

We shared one of their Tapas appetizers, the hummus with kobe beef, and that was fabulous.  It came with triangles of seasoned pita that stayed crisp to the end, and we sure did finish every drop of the hummus.

We followed it up with our standard - The Thai chicken salad.  The last time we had this was at the Centennial Sammy's, and it was so big we couldn't finish it.  This time it was skimpy, with half the amount of chicken, and not enough of the greens for us to be fully satisfied, and I'm not a big eater.  There used to be two sizes of this salad, but it was changed before we had it at Centennial, so it's definitely not a case of us having ordered a larger size last time.

When we commented to the waiter (our waitress seemed to have disappeared and he was the only one working the room), he asked if we wanted to change it for something else.  We didn't.  It was late, and we'd already gone through most of it, which wasn't hard to do this time.  He then asked my husband if he'd like another beer.  It sure sounded as if he were comping it as a result of our negative comment, but when he brought the bill, there was the charge for that second beer!!  He did remove it, but it seemed to go hand in hand with the indifferent and unfriendly service that took over when our waitress split.

This Sammy's is a bit closer to our house than the others, and is usually more convenient when we're on our way back from the Strip or environs, but next time we'll have to rethink it."}
{"text":"I've been to several Sammy's, but this was the first visit to this location.  Though they have the same decor and the same fabulous fabric lights that I love, somehow there is a coldness to this location that I don't feel at the others.  The big advantage to this one is that it's right next door to my favorite froyo - Yogurtland.  

We ordered the same as always:  the Thai chicken salad with the dressing on the side, and a goat cheese pizza.  Considering that the restaurant was nearly empty, it took a very long time to get the food.  And when it finally arrived, the salad had the dressing on it.  That was okay with my husband, who dived right in, but not with me.  So I waited, and waited some more.  By the time the replacement came, my husband was nearly finished and was ready for his pizza.

Both salads seemed larger than we remembered; we always order the small.  Sure enough, when we got the bill, we were charged for a large salad.  What a dippy waitress - couldn't get anything right!

The manager was so nice and accommodating that I bumped it back up to four stars.  And the pizza was delicious!"}
{"text":"This restaurant should in my opinion be called Sammy's Salads!!! They put together a combination of fresh ingredients with super tasty homemade dressings , my favorite is the Spicy Asian. Lia the manager who is super spectacular, friendly and professional. She's taken my ridiculously difficult order the last two times I came in with at least 6 different mods and got it perfect both times. Thanks again Lia I'm coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Four Words: Happy Hour and Tapas!

Everyday, from 4-6pm, Customers can enjoy half-price Tapas (appetizers) and $2 of beer and wine (by the glass).

On my first visit to Sammy's Woodfire Grill, I was confused because I didn't understand what the deal was about a woodfire grill. Ummm, let's just say I was impressed with the environment (pretty classy for the location). Wine, business attire and meetings and the occasional pizza on the table. I enjoyed my initial exposure (I had salmon and a salad) but it was over two years before I returned.

Then I discovered the half-off tapas and reduced price beer... Sold! Their tapas range from meatballs to Fries, potstickers and many others. It's easy to end up with a table full of empty tapa plates and an overstuffed belly. The environment is quiet and the service is elegant and friendly. I have yet to visit the restaurant during busy or peak hours but my experiences this far have been consistent  the same: thoroughly enjoyable!

Five stars for presentation, performance, taste and a happy hour deal you can't beat!"}
{"text":"I personally am not a big fan of chain restaurants.. Mostly because of the cookie cutter decor, mediocre service, typical short of nothing special menu and general ambiance. Yes, IMO Sammy's has some of that, but for what they lack they have a better than expected menu. They offer whole grain pasta and generally healthy options-or at least more than most. It is difficult to eat out and be limited to very few options when you're watching your diet. The food was tasty with average prices. I can't complain about much, but I won't complain at all. I'm sure I'll return in the near future."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 4 times, and each time have had a great experience.  Their happy hour, from 3-6, includes half-price tapas, beer, and wine, so we make a meal from their extensive (18 items) tapas menu.  They have a great wine list, with a description and rating for each wine.  I made a reservation for 12 once, and they had the table ready and were expecting me when I arrived 10 minutes early.  Attentive wait staff, great food, relaxed atmosphere.  

Only complaints:  A little hard to see if you're sitting in the sun (welcome to Vegas, though).  Crab & spinach dip has too much onion."}
{"text":"This place was better than I expected it would be. I liked that the hostess asked us before seating whether we had 45 minutes before boarding, as that was the average duration.

Our waiter was friendly and often checked in with us. He asked us if we were ok with our appetizer arriving at the same time as our entrees, instead of making that decision for us.

Their pizzas were good. We ordered the New York Pizza, the Four Cheese Pizza and the Garlic Cheesebread. The latter was mostly a garlic cheese pizza cut up into smaller pieces. It was not cheesy enough and is not worth the price imo.

Their pizzas however were good. Plenty of toppings on the New York, which had the ideal cheese-tomato balance. The Cheese pizza was very cheesy and flavorful but a bit of tomato sauce would have taken it to the next level. The size of the pizza was a small to medium size pizza elsewhere. If you are really hungry you might want to have one for yourself instead of sharing. 

All in all not a bad experience for an an airport restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food, I will give them that but the prices are high and the portions aren't \"generous\". To top it off I waited tables as a student so I'm a big \"tipper\" but I didn't want to leave a tip (I did but it pained me to do it). We felt rushed out when we finally got our meals and the bill was brought to us almost simultaneously. The food came cold and when we spoke up they didn't even offer to warm it. We've gone here before and had much better service and food but for the price we will be going elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Very good service and brought the food out fast! The food taste amazing! Highly recommend the cheesy bread!"}
{"text":"I was going to give it three stars as a reasonable place to eat in the airport. Then I saw my bill was 10.79 for a beer...I know prices are inflated in an airport and particularly with Vegas but that is crazy.


The pizza is ok but overly cheesy and haphazardly made. Unfortunately, there aren't great food options in the LV airport in general. 

Service is a bit slow as well and kept forgetting things. Also, they didn't put any effort into bussing or cleaning the tables. I actually took a photo of the mess of straws and used napkins at my little nook at the end of the bar and uploaded it to Yelp. But then felt photos should focus on the food and took it down. 

In short, I can't see myself coming back here again."}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza for an airport location. I ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza and was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ok I'm kind of a chain snob. That being said, I like this place. The food's ok, but the best thing about this place? Happy Hour!!!

Duck tacos and coconut shrimp. Lettuce wraps and kabobs. It's all good and it's all cheap. 

Ding. Ding. Ding. Everyone's a winner!  Well, maybe not the mixed drink lovers out there. Their happy hour drink menu only includes beer and wine, so keep in mind.

Don't forget to sign up online for lots of discounts and specials!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. Haven't really liked Sammys in the past other than the Sahara location. Thought I'd give it yet another try.  Shame on me. Even being starving the food had a terrible taste.  The best thing was the gluten free pizza - not the whole pizza as the toppings made it almost inedible, just the crust. Prices are crazy for the quality of food. $5 to add few chicken strips to the salad. Service was not very good either"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service needs help. Walked in 8pm, place not even 1/3 full and immediately told I'll be right with you. No hi welcome or nicety. More like what you would expect from flos diner. 
Seated and waited WAY too long for menus and drinks to order. 
Maybe I am too critical but I expect my water to be refilled without asking, to be asked - when my beer is empty - if I would like another, be checked on during appetizers and the meal as to if we are enjoying the meal and is everything good. 
With all that being said and the food being adequate there are many other choices with better pizza and service - which may be why the place was 2/3 empty. I will move onto other places - good luck"}
{"text":"Had the New York Style pizza including pepperoni, sautéed mushrooms, salami and  Italian sausage. I was able to add goat cheese which was awesome so I'm assuming you can add extra toppings to any of the pizzas however I'm not sure if it costs extra b/c I didn't see the bill so be sure to ask if you care about that.

The pizza was definitely good. Not bad, not out of this world.
My hubby, his grandma and I shared their donut dessert that came with
chocolate and raspberry sauce. Yummy, cripsy and fresh out of the oven!

Extra points for expressing sustainability and buying local ingredients as a matter of importance on their menu. Yay, sustainability, local ingredientsand yummy food!"}
{"text":"Love this place, have been coming here for years! So sad when the one closest to my house closed, but this location is great! Waitress always remembers us and has for years. Food menu is available 24/7 through the attached bar so if you're out late its perfect. You can sit outside near the fire pit or plenty of inside seating also. My favorite food items include the Lebni app and the goat cheese pizza, but I've honestly never had anything bad here. Wish they would open up on the north side!"}
{"text":"There are two things I crave whenever I go to Sammy's: the arugula & pear pizza and the salted caramel pudding.  I enjoy date nights here and the two of us usually share those two items and are perfectly content for the evening.  They are sooooo delicious and just perfectly satisfying.

This location has one large room with a small bar, tables, and booths.  The restaurant is dimly light and you can feel a draft throughout the restaurant whenever the door opens since it's just one large room.  When you walk in, there is no \"Please wait to be seated\" sign and there's usually no host/hostess, so we end up waiting around a bit awkwardly until someone notices us and leads us to a table.  Coincidently, we've ended up at the exact same time the last 3 times we were here.

Service has usually been prompt whenever we come here for dinner (around 6-8pm).  Unfortunately, all the tables and booths are pretty close together, so you end up overhearing a lot of conversations, even if you're not trying to. 

Foodwise, I feel like the menu offers a delicious and appealing variety.  As previously stated, the arugula & pear pizza is absolutely delicious, as is the salted caramel pudding.  If you only order two things, make it those!

I gave it 4 stars because of the environment.  Each time we've come here, we've had odd neighbors and overhead many conversations we didn't need to and ended up people watching since most our neighbors were odd people.  I would just try asking for a more private table, if that's possible in a large open room."}
