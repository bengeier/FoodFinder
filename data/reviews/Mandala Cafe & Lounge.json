{"text":"i used to be going to behesht for shisha, and since that became a disaster, i tried out mandala. 

the shisha is actually really great, and the service is attentive. the music is something like if daddy yankee, sami beigi and drake collaborated on. aka it's so fun."}
{"text":"Wow. By far the worst place I have ever walked into. Firstly, 2 of my friends and myself walked in and there was NO service. No one at the front to help you or anything. After about 15 minutes of standing awkwardly in the middle of the bar someone came up to ask and sat us down at a table that had water bottles from the previous customers. No one cleaned the water bottles or previous mess and no one took our order - SERVICE TERRIBLE. It was about after 20 minutes my friend and I walked up to the counter and asked for some assistance. There was NO menu and NO drinks. What kind of place does not serve FOOD? or ALCOHOL? absolutely ridiculous... We literally stood up and walked out after wasting a good half hour of our life. I  highly do NOT recommend this place. It is absolutely garbage and does NOT deserve any customers!"}
{"text":"Food is horrible so come for sheesh a but don't waste ur money on food....greasy food with no flavor and served in to go plastic containers"}
{"text":"Came here and the service was very slow. The shisha itself was okay. The variety of flavors was not that high. Atmosphere is nice and its close to home. Needs a liquor license."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout and just relax with friends. They offer good shisha with lots of different flavours and a comfortable environment"}
{"text":"Nice place good shisha great food it was all nice until my friends and I had gotten the bill. A bill that should've been only $170-180 for 5 people cost $230. On top of hst 13% they charge a 15% service on top of that coming out to what equates to a 28% charge on top of your order. They really should tell you before you order about the charge"}
{"text":"Probably the worst place I've been to. The service was horrible, the employees were ruuuudee, it's like judge all the customers there,and horrible shisha that doesn't even smoke well. It was like the employees were pissed off at everyone. They don't even make eye contact with customers, the attitude towards customers is appalling, not a very welcoming environment. I've been here before and the shisha was pretty decent, I don't know if it was the server we were dealing with or if it was an off day but my friends and I were not impressed at all. I would not waste my time coming back, I'd rather go to the most ghetto place in Scarborough and receive better service, shisha and music. The employees make it seem like a somewhat 'sophisticated' place because of the minimum charger per person however their attire does not reflect that whatsoever. They have lit sparklers on the fruit head shishas that can easily burn someone because they walk through the small pathways and with no safety concern for the customers, (my friend was almost burnt) it's unsafe if you ask me! Don't mean to throw shade, just being honest about my experience!"}
{"text":"Such a great place to chill and enjoy the time with friends we went there at 10pm waiting time was 45minutes it was my first time at this shisha cafe so I was very excited how it will be. So anyways after 45min it was our turn the waiter was very nice and friendly so we ordered our drinks which came very fast I had a mochachino which was 5$ it was a little too sweet and a strawberry smoothie which was more like a strawberry milkshake it was good but you can't say it was a smoothie for shisha we ordered the mandala mix which everyone liked a lot. The service was very nice they came often to ask if we need anything.The music was perfect not so loud so you can talk easily with your friends without having to scream. They closed the cafe at 2am I think they should little extend the timing till 4am on Saturday everything else was fine"}
{"text":"Pay less attention to the star rating I've assigned this place and more to what I have to say, as I feel the fundamental issue(s) I discovered are easy to fix and upon adjustment would warrant this place more stars in my books, and as you all know, I'm all about second chances. 

First the Pros:

1) First and foremost, it's a Hookah Bar in the GTA (these are few and far between, so big points for this. As Abbas said, this is a GREAT place to hang out with a friend, without feeling the pressure to drink (get drunk)

2)  Great selection of tobacco-free Shisha flavours. We had Watermelon with a hint of mint mixed in to make the smoke extra cool. Ask for the Orange top which means you get a larger, smoother, longer-lasting bowl (ours lasted over 2 hours between the two of us). I'm not sure if one of the other reviewers below was aware (not Abbas) but it's actually illegal to offer tobacco based shisha indoors - given the \"No Smoking\" indoors law that's been around for .... well a long time! (get with it)

3) The comfy couch-bed seating areas can fit 4-6 people easily and looked great (especially liked how everyone took their shoes off to sit here and sat cross-legged). I would highly recommend this as a date idea folks, you can easily lie down whilst enjoying a Shisha and a Tea

4) Persian Tea - My friend and I tried this for the first time (I know I live in Richmond Hill and am JUST trying Persian tea - what's up with that right?!?!) Well forgive me my trespasses friends, the Persian Tea was mild tasting, had a definite caffeine kick and with a sugar cube tasted magnificent. I could drink this daily if it always came with a Hookah

5) Super friendly service from staff, very personable and apologetic for longer wait times and you could tell they were doing their best to service everyone

And the Cons:

1) Service time was much too long, 20 minute wait to get order taken and another 20 before order was brought to table. Understandable they are busy, but they appeared highly understaffed

2) Music was CRAZY loud. Like nightclub loud, conversation was definitely a tad tricky, I'd recommend turning it from 10 down to 7

There were a couple of small things that I felt needed to be adjusted as well (bathroom door broken, etc) but I'm not a nit-picky person. I came for a night of Hookah, I got it, and I went home happy!

Update: They will soon have a liquor license, so you'll be able to enjoy a cocktail or beer with your Hookah when you come hang out with your friends!

Looking forward to returning and upgrading this from a 3.5 star to a firm 4 (or higher)."}
{"text":"So much better than how it used it be. It's newly renovated and the shisha has improved tremendously. Service is getting better, too. The staff are most concerned and focused on improving customer service, and don't even hesitate to make things better if you ever have a problem. 

At the end of the day, the environment is classy, modern, comfortable, and spacious, while the music is up-to-date, and also playing at a reasonable level of loudness. 

I always have a great time when I go. Just ordered the pistachio ice cream between two waffles yesterday. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"bad, assaulted by staff and owners for asking for water, never will come again horrible service"}
{"text":"Awesome place to hangout with your friends or bring your date if she/he smokes. Lean back atmosphere . place gets really busy after 9 pm on the weekends. Be prepared for the clouds of smoke. Great customer service,  when place gets busy tho, food takes a little longer to arrive. Great drinks and good hooka selection. If your looking for an upscale hooka lounge without the upscale prices on food, this place is for you."}
{"text":"2 star = Meh, I've experienced better. Check out my \"We smoke it erryday\" list

Shisha is slightly overpriced. Quality is hit & miss depending on how busy they are. They got different kinds of heads and add-ons for your shisha (check picture below). I recommend getting orange head (or consider watermelon head if you don't mind spending $50) It's a strong shisha so consider getting the ice hose add-on otherwise you might not like it.

Tea is nicely served in a fancy teapot. You might be expecting steeped tea, but it's just hot water and one \"Ahmad tea\" teabag per person. $3 per tea bag! shame on you! I recommend that you order any beverage other than tea. They serve bottled water instead of tap water here, a common pet peeve to most Elites!

When it comes to food, place opt for burgers, philly cheese, wraps, pizza, and Quesadillas instead of middle eastern food. I tried their burger and it was juicy, fresh & delicious. Surely worth $6.

Staff are very slow and disorganised yet apologetic. Nice, spacey decor. Booths are really comfy. Night started off with house music playing in the background that switched all of a sudden to loud club music for some reason. WiFi is free.

Place has potential but needs better management."}
{"text":"This place used to be a great lounge but not anymore. Has a very very poor staff. They are very rude and disrespectful. I used to come to this place minimum once a week and we would usually be 10 or more, (they relatively knew us) but For the past months ive visited a couple times and didn't even get to the ordering part because of their awfulll staff. I believe the manager changed but the manager is also absolutely rude. Thanks to him hes loosing lots and lots of loyal customers. Wish the owner would do something about this. Wont be going back there"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with your friends! :)

Went in around 12am on Thursday Night (so Friday morning?) 

The d√©cor was really great, the service was good,  and the shisha was good.

They had a really small menu focused on drinks (non-alcoholic) and shisha. Lots of different flavours (including al-fakher!!) 

They only had two options for food : Pizza and Nachos.

My friend ordered the Pink Starburst drink and I ordered a cappuccino.

My cappuccino was standard fare. Lots of frothed milk ,it was nothing great, but it was good.

My friend's smoothie was okay. It wasn't as sweet as I expected it to be.

They had lots of decks of cards available, so obviously my friend and I played Crazy Eights!

The only qualm I had was that the music was a bit too loud for conversation.

Other than that, if you're looking to relax, it's a great place.

Too bad there ain't no alcohol, or I'd be def going more often."}
{"text":"It was so much better before the renovation. Service is really frustrating as the staff their try to rip you off or act like they know everything and everything they have is perfect when its not. So unprofessional. Shisha and food are just okay/"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT FOOD HERE. THE FOOD IS DISGUISING HERE. the sheesha or hookah is not bad but over priced.  But the food is nasty. I rather eat at McDonald's or BK."}
{"text":"Horibble service. Was treated like shit. Will make sure not to bring myself, or any of my friends back here. Sad to see them loose it like this."}
{"text":"Had reservations for a Birthday of 15 people last night for 10:30pm! Upon our arrival we requested our table and was turned down. Management indicated that the call made could have been a prank therefore they never reserved our table. Due to the number we had and the distance from where the guests were traveling, we called ahead the day of (7pm) to ensure our reservations were in place, in which the gentleman on the phone reassured us all was good. Upon our arrival, the \"manager/owner\" refused to make room for us no hospitality what so ever. Was told well that's to bad, if you don't like it leave and practicly kicked us all out due to there mistake. 
Restassured, we were able to get a table at another shisha place down the street and they were very accommodating on such short notice. 

WORSE PLACE EVER WOULD NEVER CONSIDER GOING BACK AND NEITHER WILL THE GROUP OF 15."}
{"text":"Good ambience...good staff and nice quality of service. Good shisha. The place is developing quiet well. I like the team who strive to improve the place and maintain their clientele."}
{"text":"Today on Saturday night we were planning to go to cyan cafe to smoke some shisha and some drinks. But it was over booked so we decided to come here. I been here before it is decent place. They donot have alcohol shisha is OK not impressive.  Service is bad everything took forever to come and the guy just kept saying sorry and sorry. Servers are just trying to act cool and stuff. The tea is shit they use tea bag like come-on cannot they actually make tea. As tea is the best with shisha. They main thing I really liked is the place design that part is good very classy nicely modern design. That part I will give them thumps up."}
{"text":"Too much Crowded , very expensive and some of stuff are rude . Lightning there awful. Plus the Shisha doesn't taste good and too much smoke in place sometimes you see next person sitting beside you."}
{"text":"Located north of steeles, Mandala cafe will survive the shisha purge for a little while. Stylish, classy, and clean, this hookah bar does not want to make u place a paper between you and the seat.

The staff were hit and miss. Humble and attentive they were quick to take your order but slow to bring it out. And just like your ex trying to slide into your DMs, they be trying to get extra charges to slide on to your bill... Be careful 

The shisha itself was not bad. With no ice pick it goes down smooth with a crisp flavour. However it's a short lived feeling and within an hour you will be inhaling poison, chemicals, and ash without that green apple flavour. Sweet potato fries is just another plain Jane but good with tea. 

Unlike most places this place dosent hide the fact they are trying thief your wallet. If your smart and watch your bill however, it will be a good time. Thieving Wallet only happens in weekends. Mon-thurs it's a 5 dollar sitting fee opposed to 10."}
{"text":"After having gone here several times, I can say this place has great quality Shisha. There's a wide variety of flavours and lots of extras such as milk in the base (in place of water) and Ice Hoses to cool the smoke. I usually go for the more premium options and find that the smoke lasts 3 of us a good hour.

The tea and sweets here go nicely with the shisha and is always a hit with whoever I bring with me. Definitely recommend a trip out here for a relaxing evening."}
{"text":"I've come here twice now, and I absolutely love the vibe here!

Both times, I've come late on a Saturday night, around 10:30/11pm. Most recently we had to give our names and had to wait a good 20 min before our name was called, but our corner lounge area we were seated in, was well worth the wait!

Four our usual girls night with 4 people we typically get 2 shishas, one blueberry mint and the other Summer Sixteen. Both are amazing, but after coming twice, Summer Sixteen is definitely my favourite. 

They've also recently renovated, and it shows! With the updated furniture and the cute stringed lights hanging from the walls and indoor trees, it definitely creates the best chill vibe. 
For food, we usually order the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Mandala Fries. Both are great, and complement each other so well. 

If you order one food item, I HIGHLY recommend the Mandala Fries. It's a dish where they fries are tossed in a deliciously flavoured sauce and drizzles with garlic sauce on top. It's honestly amazing! 

The service here is also great, the staff are so friendly, and helpful."}
{"text":"Overall my experience here was a solid 3.5 stars. I came from out of town and was looking for a hookah spot near our hotel. This was about 20 minutes from centerpoint mall area and was easy to find. They looked busy as there was a line at the door. Apparently hookahs are about to be banned in Toronto- which is totally LAME! Decor was on point, and the food was really good and cooked well. Service was sub par. I come from a customer service driven city and coming to beautiful Toronto I was disappointed with the lack of customer service here. Not even a smile on anyone's face. We were lucky if someone would come to our table to ask if there was anything we needed. Hookahs were not great either- quality was very low. 

What did not bring this place to a 4 star was the fact that at the end of the night we had to stand in a long line to pay our bill. The place is not big and we totally felt awkward and in the way of the servers and the other guests at their table. Very uncomfortable. 

My suggestion to the owners is to make your servers and hosts have a smile on their face and bring customer service back to the place. You'd be surprised how much of a difference your business will be if the people working here actually looked like they enjoy their jobs. Also please allow servers to bring checks to the tables- it will allow servers to end the service and bring the experience full circle by appreciating your customer's business. This is not a mall- most guests don't want to stand in a long line at the end of their night and almost get run over by servers carrying large hookahs!"}
{"text":"My experience in this place is really bad, fist time been there and it is the last time. I ordered double apple shisha and it tasted horrible I told the server that it doesn't taste right and he was I promise that this is how the double apple tastes, hello!! This is not the first time I smoke shisha I know how it should taste this head is burnt. The service is so slow it takes them forever. I ordered tea which they bring it in a very nice pot with one bag of tea come on really!
I have to say that the place is very nice the interior design and the booths and nicely laid out. Also if you decide to go and check this place out I do recommend the lava cake it is good."}
{"text":"This lounge is a very modern and chic establishment. I was actually quite impressed off first impressions alone. It had a good crowd. While the music could've been a notch lower, it was good music nonetheless. Now the bone I have to pick with this place is the ridiculously slow service I received. From sitting down to actually receiving our hookah, it must've taken about 45 minutes. I understand the Friday night rush but wait times like that are a turn off.  It completely took away from the experience of enjoying shisha at a lounge rather than chez moi (my home)."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite some time since I live close by. They recently underwent renovation which resulted in an increase in prices and I, as a long time customer, find that a bit frustrating. 

Like any other shisha place, they offer different kinds of heads and add-ons to customize your shisha according to your taste. I recommend getting the orange head because it is stronger than a regular head, tastes better, and lasts much longer so you can enjoy your stay there.

On the down side, they only serve bottled water instead of tap water and I highly suggest purchasing any other beverage since you'll be paying anyways. Besides beverages, their menu does contain various types of dishes if you are feeling hungry. 

The decor is super chills and they have these comfy booths you can sit at if you are a group of 4 or more people. The playlist always gets the mood going, except when they turn up the volume and you can no longer hear what your friends are saying (which never fails to get me wondering WHY THEY DON'T SERVE ALCOHOL). 
Free wifi and friendly staff BUT the service is slow at times. Make sure you don't go super late cause then you will have to wait to be seated and that's never fun."}
{"text":"Places like this should not exist. In the short time I was there, I witnessed a fight break out as well as people who were clearly under the influence of something other than 'shisha.' 

Down to business, the shisha is overpriced as are the drinks. Would never return."}
{"text":"AWFUL SHISHA BAR DO NOT COME HERE! I went to Mandala last year and after sitting down with a shisha my four friends and I were told we have to pay $10 each! 1 shisha costs around $13 at any place in the GTA! We got into a big argument with the waiter and manager who told us that we are free to \"shop around and try out other places\". I have NEVER been spoken to that rudely by any server or employee at any store in my life! What terrible service and disgusting attitudes by management and a server. They did not tell us before hand or have anything on the menu indicating that we had to spend $10 each as two of us had just ate and just wanted to share the shisha. I was shocked at the service and am still wondering how this place is still in business. After yelling arguing with the waiter we finally paid for just 1 shisha. I hope this place goes under soon."}
