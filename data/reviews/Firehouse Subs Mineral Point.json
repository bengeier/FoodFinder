{"text":"I got the beef brisket it looked really good the bread was good the sauce was good the cheese was good but the brisket was smashed and tasteless. They have the coke freestyle I tried the cherry limeade it was very bland I tried two or three other drinks and they all tasted kind of off and not very Good."}
{"text":"I really like this place but when anyone walks in and they say \"welcome to firehouse\" it is sooooooo LAME!!!! I think the owner is there & he even sounds lame, they JUST should say HEY how ya doin! It is just to rehearsed and bad........So everytime I go there I know I'm going to here this stupid greeting.........It's just stupid."}
{"text":"Owner on site. Excellent service. Friendly staff. Love the firehouse theme throughout. Subs are very tasty and warmed to my perfection. 
Conveniently located for easy in and out!"}
{"text":"Tried the pulled pork sweet Thai chili sandwich with high expectations. I was very disappointed. The pork was super fatty and the Thai sauce very flavorless and greasy. The only shining light was the bread was delicious. Very soft and chewy. I haven't given up on Firehouse Subs yet. Just going to try something else."}
{"text":"Great subs! Chewy sub bun, slow cooked beef very tender, perfectly sauced, generous portion! Fast and friendly service, clean and bright decor! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The Firehouse Sub's on Mineral Point Road is a prime example of how to run a fast food restaurant!  The food is great, and it comes out quickly!  The staff is courteous and eager to help!  What could be better!"}
{"text":"I have stopped to eat here a few times with my family and also a few times by myself. Every time while walking through the doors, I was greeted with, \"Hello, welcome to Firehouse Subs!\" by several staff working behind the counter. I'm sure it is required for them to say it, but it is always refreshing when walking in. The subs are very tasty, restaurant is clean, and the firehouse decor is unique. My kid's favorite part about this place is the firefighter hat that they get. I rated 4 our of 5 because it can get pricey. about 6 bucks for a regular sub + 2 bucks for combo. Then the large sub is around $8 + $2 for the combo."}
{"text":"Yummmmmyyyyyyy!! The turkey and ham with Swiss tomatoes n onion is fab will return again worth the money great subs!! And the pickles rock!!"}
{"text":"Sandwich was expensive without any real leg up over the competition. Products slopped out of the sandwich when I tried to pick it up on both sides. Staff seemed somewhat listless and uncommunicative past their minimum requirement, which tells me they're probably underpayed, overworked, under-appreciated.

Women were operating the registers while minorities made the food. Checked the website; upper management is all white men. I see a pattern here.

I have gone to two Firehouse sub locations, both in Madison, and each time I find myself asking \"Why did I go here? Oh yeah, I'm pressed for time and this place is on the way,\" and then I endeavor to not go back.

 Edit: I checked what firehouse pays hourly @ the register and food prep - I now understand where the minimum effort comes from; it reflects the unsustainable wage they pay their workforce whilst donating thousands to firefighter and law enforcement-related charities."}
{"text":"Update: initially when the new, enthusiastic owner was on-site it was fantastic.  Now, he's likely pulled out to start new franchises or other pursuits.  His absence can't be filled by two hourly disengaged workers.  The result: sick stomach due to meat that had likely been retained too long in an effort to maximize profit through cost reduction.

Bummer.  As I said 2 years ago when the owner's presence is no longer a dominant force behind the service and product quality delivery, things will go downhill.  I was right..."}
{"text":"I was hoping for a kick @$$ sandwich - I got what might be a step above subway but they don't even bake their own bread (subway does). I'll stick with jimmy johns or keep looking."}
{"text":"The subs are always good. I always get the New York Steamer and I am never disappointed in the sub. However the customer services at this location is sub-par and I will probably avoid going back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sub places. Fast, fresh and convenient. Every sub is so delicious. I recommend the chili too. The wall of hot sauces was a nice touch. They also deliver. And Firehouse has such a great story and background too. Way better than Subway and other sub shops."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and I was most impressed by the exceptional customer service. Greeted, served, and door opened for me when I left and wished happy holidays.  Nice to see that enthusiasm still alive and well"}
{"text":"Waited 35 minutes for 2 subs. When we asked after 20 minutes about our subs we were rudely told \"it's coming\". Tables were dirty, and floors had not been swept. We typically love Firehouse, but this location was not the best."}
{"text":"I had been driving by this place for the last couple of weeks and the stylists at the next door Cost Cutters had been talking it up so I knew I had to go in and try it. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by so many smiling faces. I ordered the #10 I believe it was a bbq brisket sub? Either way it was to die for and and will give all local sub places a run for the money. As the first reviewer mentioned its about $8.00 for the combo and the pickle is included too. If you round your bill up to the nearest dollar the change gets donated to a fund for firefighting equipment. The attitudes and the tasty sub and the fact that they donate money are the reasons this place will get my business. 

5 stars for this one."}
{"text":"I'm came I at 2:30 on a Sunday it took more than 5 min to take our Order maybe even 10 min and no one was in line in front of us. We were told Twice I will be right with you (that is totally unacceptable) 
We also had to wait 10 min to get our Subs
We couldn't get a Drink while waiting because they were out of ALL Diet Soda 
The Subs were good 
But this place is poorly run"}
{"text":"Madison isn't exactly lacking for sub shops, so if you're going to open one, it's best to be on top of your game. I appreciate that this was started by firefighters, and they sell large empty pickle buckets for $2 a pop, the proceeds of which go to a firefighters' relief fund. The buckets are great for storing toys, foods, etc. The store is clean and hygienic, and the employees are friendly and quick. This, however, is where my accolades for the place end.

I ordered a Firehouse Hero, which has \"Premium roast beef, smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, and melted provolone.\" It is served \"fully-loaded\" by default, which includes mayo, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a kosher dill pickle on the side. I opted for their wheat bread, and told them to hold the onion (raw onions are too strong for me) and the mayo (I find the extra calorie/fat wallop unnecessary). It took longer than it does at my usual place (Milio's), but that is probably because they do toast the contents so that the cheese will melt. They didn't seem to have any other toppings available, so (unlike even a Subway franchise) loading up a sub with filling veggies isn't possible. I ordered the sandwich to go, as I had one brief errand to run before heading home. The time between being handed the sandwich and getting home was less than 20 minutes, and I was starving (first meal of the day at 2 p.m.), so I expected it to taste great. What I got was definitely underwhelming. The pickle, which they rolled into a piece of paper and then rolled into the entire sub, had leaked pickle juice all over the sandwich. I love the flavor of pickles, but it had drenched the bread, which was now soggy and falling apart. The meats and toppings were all there, but the entire experience was underwhelming. Good bread is the key to a great sub, and this was bland and mushy. I don't see myself returning, despite its close proximity to my apartment."}
{"text":"I really like Firehouse subs. I have been a few times and I have enjoyed every trip. I have great service every time and the subs are great. You walk into a clean restaurant with the staff greeting you right when you walk in. Usually you don't have to wait more than 2 minutes to order. You may wait a bit longer to get your food during the lunch rush but that is a maximum of 15 minutes. I always get great food and can watch sports while enjoying it. I will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. The sub was great. The cashier was not overly friendly. She did her job and took my order. That's as far as it went. It was around 1:00pm. They were out of tea. I wanted unsweetened tea and a customer behind me wanted sweet tea. They were out of both. That was a disappointment."}
{"text":"I want to preface this review by noting that I am not a sandwich person.  For some reason however I found myself inside the walls of Firehouse Subs and I am so happy that I did.  

Firehouse subs have been popping up everywhere along with many other sandwich places.  Walking into this restaurant is a different experience than other sandwich places because it has a very restaurant-y vibe.  This location is huge and you are greeted when walking in by a cheerful sandwich maker.  Firehouse also has a large menu; almost too large :)   I finally was however able to decide on the Italian sub.  My partner ordered the spicy meatball.  Firehouse subs is a bit pricier than other sub places but the quality, I found out, is better than other sandwich places. 

Ten minutes or so after we ordered, our food was delivered.  The meatball sub looked amazing. I also later found out that it tasted amazing.  My sandwich was just as great!  It had just enough meat, they weren't too heavy handed on the condiments, and it tasted fresh.  Towards the end of our meal, someone came by to ask how everything was and I enthusiastically said that it was the best sandwich I had ever eaten  And it really was.  It tasted nice and fresh and much better than the competition.  I  highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Owner was very active. Making sure everyone was happy and helping his staff. Those mean a lot to me. 

The Hero sub was fantastic."}
{"text":"The place is very well decorated, loved the theme of the Fire station!
People were very friendly, and sandwich was very good.
Overall, would absolutely go back when in town next time."}
{"text":"Quick.  Friendly.  Fresh. 

Ive been to FH all over the country and there is a standard they set. 

This is pretty much all I expect out of Firehouse.  And that is exactly what I got this afternoon when I grabbed a quick salad.  Everything was put together with care with a friendly staff. 

Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I pass Firehouse Subs several times a week and finally decided to stop in to try... Well it was well worth it.  The 'Steamer' sub I ordered was AWESOME!  

I compare to a Quiznos in style but much better quality in my opinion.  The bread is fantastic.  And it is always great to see a big Saturday crowd looking to be in full enjoyment.

The place is clean, comfortable, smells incredible, and the people I interacted with were very friendly and happy to have my business.  I will definitely be back and highly recommend to anyone looking for a great sandwich.  

I am withholding one star only because I have yet to try more of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"There are a lot of sandwiches places on State St, but this new one holds up great! Highlights of firehouse include some phenomenal toasted bread and a myriad of hot sauce! An actual myriad. You just don't see that much these days."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of subs but every so often I get a craving. I like this location because the food is good and the service is fantastic! It is clean and inviting, although it would be nice if one of the tvs had news or something other than sports on."}
{"text":"Love their subs, but the wait for lunch is absolutely unacceptable. I have been sitting here going on 20 minutes and still haven't received my sandwich. I count 4 people doing everything: taking orders, making sandwiches, running them out. I count 25 people waiting right now. The employees are not the issue, they are working their hardest to keep up. From previous reviews, this doesn't seem like an anomaly. There is no excuse for this and I will not be returning. Management take note."}
{"text":"Firehouse Subs really puts out the fire at all other sub/sandwich joints (haha!). I love the concept and the decor ain't shabby either. The staff strikes the perfect balance between a grab-n-go joint and a sit-down place. If you dine-in, they will bring your subs to your tabl, and then pick up the empty trays once you are finished. 

The menu isn't so large as to be overwhelming, and the prices are comparable to typical sub/sandwich places ($5ish for a sandwich and $8ish for a meal w/ drink and chips).  Although there were quite a few sandwiches that I wanted to try on the menu, I ended up going with the smokehouse beef + cheddar.

The sandwich was served up piping hot with no veggies (just the way I like it!)...just super tender beef sandwiched between some melted cheddar cheese and doused with BBQ sauce. Delish. Perfect for a post-distillery tour meal. :9

If Firehouse was any closer to my apartment, I would be there everyday."}
{"text":"Bottom line - excellent sanwiches.

The store is big, clean, and the employees are super-friendly.  Today I had the meatball sub, which was pretty good.  So far my favorite is the pastrami and corned beef sandwich (Sooooooooo gooooooood)...  The steak/cheese is fantastic as well.  I look forward to trying other selections!

Subs here cost a little more than other places, but the quality is higher.  The 8\" sub (in a combo) is plenty, even for a big guy like me.  

I'd rate at 5-stars if it were a better deal ($9 is more than I prefer to pay for lunch) OR if deals/coupons were availble (and not just on Saturday mornings).

Great subs, clean place, friendly staff.  Worth a stop!"}
{"text":"What can you say...Great food and a percent of the profits go to a good cause (supporting Fire Fighter and their families).  I am a sandwich person and I pick them over SubWay any day...Choice are great...and an abundance of sauces to top that sandwich with....did I mention that a percentage of profits go to local Fire Fighters and their families."}
{"text":"Just finished eating half of a large sized Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket and so far it's been the only sandwich I've gotten at Firehouse Subs since it's my favorite! The sandwich was delicious and the staff was very friendly as usual! 

The theme of the shop definitely sets it apart from other sandwich shops with the Firehouse Theme. There's a beautiful mural on the wall (which just so happens to be a Pokémon Go spot). Inside there is ample seating, but typically we take the sandwiches to go. 

I'd definitely recommend getting a combo with a medium sandwich or a large sandwich (I like to save half for lunch the next day). With a combo, you can get a bag of chips and a drink on the side. There's also a nice slice of pickle with every sandwich, so that's always a nice surprise! 

Also, a rounding up donation to the foundation is always nice that this place supports a good cause. Although, I only go to this Firehouse Subs a few times a month, I definitely enjoy each visit!"}
{"text":"This is a cool firehouse-themed shop. Shiny red decor everywhere. They have perfect, delicious, flavorful, sandwiches PACKED with meat and sauce, they don't skimp you. Very friendly and helpful staff. Quick service. This is my favorite sub shop that I always visit when I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"First time here. Very cool restaurant with great subs! I love the support they give to Madison first responders."}
