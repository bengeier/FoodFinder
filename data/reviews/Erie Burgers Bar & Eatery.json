{"text":"Another great spot I'd go for lunch while working in the area.  The employees are all friendly and show they care about their customers and service.  Food is good and they are very prompt with making and serving food.  Love the fries!    Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and pleasant to deal with.  The burgers imho were under seasoned and a bit firm.   I had a single with mustard and hot peppers.   My son liked his double cheeseburger however.   I want will give it one more shot when they get their liquor license.   I really don't have too much negative to say I just like juicer and more seasoned food."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place on the way to Cedar Point. All I can say is WOW. The burgers were unbelievably delicious. Of course I had to order the Erie burger.. Figured that would be the signature flavor and man am I glad I did. Everything was cooked perfectly, the egg exploded when I bit into it. Full of flavor. The owners are really nice, friendly, informative, etc.

We drove all the way from Charlotte, NC to go to cedar point and I would drive all the way up to this place for another Erie burger. So. Good. Do yourself a favor and stop here if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Fresh burger cooked and ready in under five minutes. You have to try the sweet potatoes fries. Been here a good amount of times over the last couple months. Trying to think of anything i didn't love and can't think of anything. Talked to the owner for a while on my last visit. A professionally trained chef that worked at high end restaurants in Vegas and out west. Came back home to open a place that serves fresh sandwiches quickly with the best ingredients. You have to ad bacon onto any sandwich. Of course they'll see me again. Owner also said they're expanding and adding a full service bar soon"}
{"text":"Welcome addition in Avon Lake.  -  very clean and friendly staff.  They have An all beef hot dog and fries meal that my son enjoyed -   I will be back soon to try their signature burgers.  Great alternative to the fast food selections across the street."}
{"text":"This place is really cozy and nice. My friend and I came in around 6:30pm on a Friday. We did the create your own burger combo with fries and it was delicious. I added mushrooms and caramelized onions to my burger and they were a nice addition. The fries had the perfect amount of sauce and were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I recommend the house sauce. It's really good. The staff was super friendly and the service was fast. I would recommend and definitely want to go back for a quick and yummy burger."}
{"text":"Great burgers, really good. Friendly staff. Salads are a great size, very filling and you can add a burger or other protein. Very flavorful and tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the best burger and fries ever! They use locally sourced grass fed beef. It was really juicy without being greasy. The Ahi tuna burger I saw someone else order looked great too."}
{"text":"Not impressed- firstly they don't do take out on the weekends. We ordered from there on a week night and it still took 45 minutes. Frozen burgers not at all what we were expecting for the prices. The fries are fantastic but the burgers are nothing special. In addition burgers are so over cooked they're barely recognizable. Our order was completely wrong and half the items we ordered on the build your own were missing.
I'm all for supporting local so we may give it another try in a few months in hopes it improves."}
{"text":"This new spot is definitely worth a try. I Had the gyro and it was large and good. It had the right mix of lamb meat and other ingredients plus the sauce was just right. The place was very clean and the service was prompt and servers were nice."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this local gem. It's small but welcoming. Had the Corned Beef with fries. Both were excellent. Fries were amazing. Wife had the Chicken Salad Sandwich. Very light and delicious. Youngest had the hotdog. It was a very nice hotdog!  Very nice staff too. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing we waited over 1 hour for burgers. Staff was nice and apologetic, manager came by paid for our meal. Equally disappointing was that the explanation was that the size of the kitchen could not handle the volume. Poor planning."}
{"text":"I recently heard this place is expanding into the space next to it and my first question was, \"Why?\" -- I hate to say this but: it's just not very good. I've given this place three tries over the course of about a year. It's close to my mom so we have stopped in when we're looking for a quick bite in her area and don't want to eat at McDonald's etc. Every time the burgers vastly underwhelmed. They're dry, have absolutely zero flavor and I left there thinking I could have schooled these guys with my own burgers at home. The sweet potato fries are good but they're greasy and have powdered sugar on top which may or may not float your boat. Regular fries aren't worth ordering. They'd do better to buy bags of Nathan's crinkle cut or the like and deep fry those. These guys could do big business -- they have a monopoly on burger places in Avon Lake -- but they have to step up their game - WAY up. They need to admit their current burger just isn't working (crickets and empty seats in that shop whenever you go), and not marry themselves to a sinking ship. They need to experiment with different burger recipes (I'd suggest adding some egg or buttermilk or any kind of moisture, maybe bread soaked in milk and then add like ANY spices at ALL). Figure out a better way to deep fry your fries so they don't get soaked with oil. Just do SOMETHING -- or we'll be driving by in another year and seeing the \"For Rent\" sign on the door and think: we saw that one coming. With Culvers opening in June they'll stick a fork in this place if you don't get competitive. Sorry -- wish I could have sung your praises. Wanted to love it; just can't."}
{"text":"I don't have anything bad to say about the storefront or the workers, the place is nice and clean and the order taker is very friendly! If only the food matched. 

The main complaint is lack of seasoning. 

Starting with the fries, they aren't golden brown or crispy, more on the mushy, soggy, beige side and they are WAY under seasoned. Potatoes need a lot of salt! 

Next, the burger is also under seasoned, very firm, not juicy at all, a little chewy actually. I got the house sauce but don't even know what it tastes like. There was maybe a teasooon on the whole burger. 

With some simple adjustments this place has the potential to be a great quick eat. Best of luck!"}
{"text":"Wow factor on flavor..bigtime..we had Reuben w/fresh cut fries...and Lake Erie breaded fried perch on a delicious brioche  bun w/fries..oh, btw corned beef was super duper tender...and again very flavorful. ."}
{"text":"I have been here now 10 times have brought a lot of people I have no idea what happened to the burgers into the food except for the used to have the two owners working the kitchen and they cared and they knew the recipes now they have some guy who is not very good there's no flavor my favorite Erie Burger has zero Flavor now and should be bursting with flavor very disappointed the whole place is a disappointment never going back"}
{"text":"Burger is delicious. Customer service flawless. Surprisingly didn't see many customers there. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Everything else questionable.   Was there and hour and 1/2 and never saw the barmaid wipe down the bar top once.  Friendly people but not a very well ran business.  Give it a year."}
{"text":"Top notch place, great service and best burgers in Cleveland area. Just wish it was closer to me, hopefully they'll open an East side location eventually!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place since the wait was so long at Parker's burger night. Unfortunately, there were some employee issues since both cooks were new today. Apparently employees were fired over the weekend leaving no one to cook. Sad. Everyone was trying to hold it together and Mike did a miraculous job keeping things moving along. After about an hour, my husband's burger came out first and by the time mine came he was done eating. Mike took care of us and we just couldn't be mad. Burgers were good but wish I could have been there on a normal night. We'll try again after things settle down."}
{"text":"Delicious. Walked right in and ordered. Wait was minimal and we watched our burgers being made. Kid friendly. Don't pass this place by!"}
{"text":"Ordered food to go and it was awful. Their \"homemade\" Hummus was literally like play dough and I shouldn't have even tasted it based on appearance and texture but it was gross. Couldn't scoop or dip their pita into the hummus it was that thick. The burger was the saddest thing ever. It was a very small, thin, weirdly shaped patty. They forgot the cheese, and even the veggies for toppings weren't great. This is probably the 4th and last time I've ordered from Erie Burger Co. It has gotten gradually worse every time. I brought it to owners attention and he apologized and blamed it on training. Well a good owner should be there overlooking training and making sure the food they're sending out is exactly what they want it to be. And if not them, a manager. Food they send out to customers is a representation of the owner(s), and their business."}
{"text":"Great burgers and sandwiches. Have had the corned beef, a burger and the lamb gyro. All were excellent. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times before but this was my first time trying out the new bar area. If you are into a dark, can barely see the person next to you feel while the drunk bartender is giving his buddies shots upon shots of jager (ewe) this is the place for you. I will say the bartender filling his glass of soda with booze and then slurring his words to get my order at 4pm was a very interesting experience to have while trying to have a quick bite with your mom. Oh and did I mention the bartender was also having a bite with his buddies at the bar while behind the bar? The lack of professionalism was amazing...I mean I have been to many types of bars and rarely witness this type of behavior. If you want people to come in and come back...this needs to change.. It was very odd that half of the bar kept going back behind the bar for things as if they work there or something which sent an odd vibe. The bar is not welcoming if you are not a regular or work there. We did a quick eat and one drink only kind of thing so we could leave the boys club that we busted in on. It's bad when you  can't read the menus (menus need work...look like a bad copy on stock paper) due to the bad mood lighting and are wanting to bust out the flashlights on the phone. The bar area is not kid friendly even though there are a couple of arcade games...well it may not even be older adult friendly if dark spaces are hard to navigate...The three stars are for the burger! I heard them say they have a new person in the kitchen and they did good on their choice! The best burger I had from there to date. I like my burgers med rare and it was to exact temp which is something I struggle to find a place that actually can cook it to temp.  Plenty of flavor and very juicy! With that being said until there are changes made to the bar area..you won't be seeing myself sitting there having a drink or two. It just goes to show how one person and lighting can set the tone of the place."}
{"text":"We went here specifically because of the high Yelp! ratings. I can not fathom the source of these positive reviews. Our experience was nearly opposite to the trend.

The staff was very pleasant and the service good. That is where our positive experience ended. The spartan restaurant was completely empty at prime dinner time when we went, and no one else came in while we ate.

The \"Best Gyro in the State\" was perhaps the greasiest and least appealing I've ever had (regardless of geography). The meat was definitely frozen and the oversized and thin pita got soggy and fell apart before the first bite.

The burger did *not* seem to be \"fresh, locally sourced, grass fed\" and definitely did not have any seasoning whatsoever. Bland meat, bland toppings, bland cheese, bland bun. A \"professionally trained chef\" would season the meat and would not cook it to the point of dried out chewiness. They also might toast the bun.

The fries (both potato and sweet potato) were similarly unseasoned and flavorless. Undercooked and mushy, grease soaked into the ubiquitous gingham paper used for plating.

The house-made sauces might have been good, but we couldn't tell because there was barely any to speak of on the sandwiches.

Overall: Fast and friendly service, but quite expensive, bland, greasy, and we will not be returning.

I am normally one to give a new place the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately my experience was so diametrically opposed to all the other reviews I had to share my take."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best. Not kid friendly (no juice or high chairs) soggy, salty, greasy burgers. Not impressed. Inside felt empty and just seemed like a dive"}
{"text":"Kinda shocked by how great the reviews are. Both our burgers were very well done, not juicy at all. The fries tasted old and very bland. The burgers definitely did not seem like a local grass fed burger. Five guys burgers beats this place by a landslide. Disappointing because there's a lot of potential there."}
{"text":"So good! Everything about this place was great! I definitely recommend! From the excellent service to perfectly cooked food, it was a great experience. Loved the small business feel. Business was consistent while we sat inside and ate, it was clear others were impressed as well. We will definitely be back!"}
