{"text":"I like the pad thai, as it is a sweet but tasty concoction of noodles and chicken and bean sprout... i like that I can douse it in Siracha and have the perfect sweet but spicy blend. I've ordered it a few times and always been satisfied.

The green curry chicken was a loser though. Hardly any chicken, and oversized chunks of broccoli and carrot (seriously large, like needed to be further sliced into smaller parts to make tolerably edible). It was lacking spice, and lacking flavour. Will not pass.

The spring rolls are decent too, even though the sauce to dip it in is weird, clear, and kinda odd all around. But its all fairly priced and the delivery is relatively prompt given how wide their service area. I'd give the place 4 stars if I didn't absolutely hate the curry. But alas, here we are. 3 stars!"}
{"text":"No complaints.   Really good pad Thai, and service.    The price was great and filled us up."}
{"text":"Ordered the Thai Spicy Noodle (lamb) and the meat was raw!"}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN BALLS EVER! They are light and crispy and delicious. I haven't tried another since I've found these hidden gems. I also, really enjoy the General Tao Chicken which is just spicy enough, without over powering. The coating is also nicely served beneath the sauce, (where as some slides off) 

We ordered the set dinner for two and easily for 6 meals from it. So totally worth the investment. There is also a good amount fried rice in the order with a really good amount of Chicken. And again, best chicken balls I've ever had. 

I would recommend this place and will go/order again, often !"}
