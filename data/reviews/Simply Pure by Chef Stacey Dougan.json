{"text":"I must say, the creativity of Stacey's menu was incredible.  My husband and I are drastically changing our diets and searched high and low in Vegas for some healthy choices.  Came across Simply Pure and my husband who has never had a vegan/ vegetarian meal devoured the large sample platter. He said it was too good to be true.  Hope to find something of similar calamari in Atlanta."}
{"text":"Great food . My carnivore husband an myself a vegetarian for over 20 years recently had lunch there and even he loved it . We had the vegetarian tacos in a red pepper wrap instead of the vegan option and we also had the vegan nachos. Both were amazing full of flavor and good texture very friendly service . The only thing that would have made it better is the protein/fake meat was, it was cold and for tacos and nachos we expected a warm dish . If we had the option to have it heated up that would have made the whole experience perfect . Hopefully when we visit next time they can accommodate our hot request :)"}
{"text":"Just randomly stopped by the container park today for the first time. My wife and I had no idea this place was here and decided to try it. We ordered the raw \"chicken\" salad wraps, and the tlc juice. We normally wouldn't order a juice but thought we would give it a chance. And we loved it! The chicken salad is now our new favorite food in Las Vegas!!! GO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!!! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great place for Vegan food! I've been here twice and got the lasagna both times(super filling and delicious!).The staff is always super friendly & ready to help you with any questions you may have. Not a big deal, But the food can take around 10-12 minutes, so this may not be the spot for you if you're in a rush.   Be prepared, the portions are HUGE so only come if you're hungry or ready to share!"}
{"text":"A-MAZ-ING Trying to be a good friend to my vegan traveling partner, I agreed to come to lunch here so she could indulge and have a truly vegan meal. I ate a big breakfast because I was sure I wouldn't like anything on the menu. I mean, vegan cheese? Come on.  BUT... I think I scarfed down half of her nachos! They are amazing!!! Delicious! They certainly don't taste vegan. The jicama fries are interesting. But the nachos are amazing! So, all you vegan Vegas visitors... Your meat-eating friends will be happy joining you here for a lovely lunch. :)"}
{"text":"Today's dinner is an adventure!  I visited container Park at the east end of the Fremont Street Experience in Las Vegas, and tried the Nachos Grande and natural Ginger Ale!  The Nachos could have had more vegan cheese but all in all it was nutritious with the vege ground beef and avocado slices!  I would order it again!"}
{"text":"We Google Map'd this restaurant and were totally delighted with the delightful location (Container Park) and the very friendly girl who greeted us. We even got to meet Chef Stacey, the designer of this healthy vegan cuisine. We first encountered a person on the sidewalk who highly recommended the restaurant and then a shop keeper in the center who raved about the vegan nachos. Walking into the small cafe, we were immediately impressed with a beautiful fresh aroma of living food. We ordered the vegan nachos and the chicken salad wrap which are both highly recommended. They have some great fresh squeezed juice combos too. The ambiance is upbeat and casual. You can dine right outside the cafe on the balcony overlooking the center made entirely of containers. We will definitely come back here again if we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"I went there with my friend, he had the lasagnas and I got the Jicama Chili Cheese fries. The lasagnas were delicious. The Jicama Chili was good too, but unfortunately it was too salty... However, the cheese was perfect.  The place was very nice. Give it a try !"}
{"text":"When we entered the Container Park, I first saw the Pork and Beans sign and figured I would have to wait for dinner . . . then, I saw the \"Vegan Cafe\" sign and all was right with the world.  I ordered the Chili Cheese Fries and they were excellent.  My wife ordered the nachos and they too were excellent, though it is not as difficult to make excellent nachos as it is to make fries using jicama.  The service was quick and friendly and the food was great.  My only negative comment about the food offered is that much of it was an attempt at replicating non vegan food.  I don't miss meat or dairy and I prefer a vegan restaurant that challenges me to try new and wild creations, not replicating food that wasn't that good when I ate meat and dairy.  If you are in the Container Park area, this cafe is a great place for a snack, lunch, or even a dinner.  On a warm night, you can sit outside and watch the kids go crazy while you enjoy a vegan meal."}
{"text":"Me and my wife are in town celebrating our 20 year wedding anniversary. Had a chance to visit this amazing place Located downtown Las Vegas in Container Park. We had an amazing  Experience here the food was so good. I'm a Vegan but my wife isn't,  so said if all vegan food tasted this good she would become a vegan. Chef Stacy is so friendly and humble. The service was awesome the food was amazing. I highly recommend this place to anyone whether you are vegan or not the food was amazing and the atmosphere is pleasant. #theswollvegan"}
{"text":"I went to Simply Pure on a downtown Vegas food tour.  I am not a vegan or a vegetarian so this is probably not a place I would have visited on my own.  However, it was AMAZING.  I had the nachos and they were my (and my even more skeptical husband's) favorite dish on the tour.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes food."}
{"text":"So excited to try her new vegan lasgna, green chili enchiladas, and grilled TLT!  I have had her personal chef services many times.  Stacey is amazing.  Congrats on your new loacation!"}
{"text":"Very good for vegan raw cuisine. We tried a couple things from the salad bar and then ordered from the menu. Spring rolls are as good as you would imagine a spring roll to  be. So no complaints there. Lettuce wraps were great flavor, but I would have enjoyed them more if they were served with a crunchier lettuce. The lettuce used is thin and has no crunch, so since the inside faux chicken is soft in texture, I felt like it's too much \"soft\" per bite texturally. I solved this by crunching up the chips that came with it and adding them inside. Aside from that, though, the taste is GREAT! Best faux chicken salad I have ever tasted. If I were to bring it home, I would probably add celery and spread it over crackers. YUM!"}
{"text":"The food is great, and the costumer service as well. I would recommend their grilled cheese, pesto, tomato panini with tofu and avocado. The place is clean and the food is super fresh. I will definitely be back. Great vegan spot."}
{"text":"I've had two completely different experiences with this restaurant. The first time we ordered sampler#1 with sweetheart juice which both were good. However, my second experience was a disaster. We ordered zucchini pasta with Alfredo sauce. The portion of this 11-dollar dish was just enough to feed a 2-year old kid. The Alfredo sauce was not either creamy as promised in the menue. Completely dasappointed."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! In the container park by Fremont, a little difficult to get to but definitely worth it! Had the raw zucchini noodles with cashew Alfredo sauce, mushrooms, sundries tomatoes, and avocado. AMAZING. They have so many other options as well if you're looking some something a little bit more heavy. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you're in the Fremont Street area, you definitely need to try Simply Pure! It is located in the Container Park area, and has some cute little shops surrounding it (including Vegan jerky options across from it!) I ordered their sampler, which included three small portions of zucchini 'noodles' with three different sauces - All three were phenomenal! Raw, vegan and delicious! Next were the vegan raw 'tacos' but instead of a shell, it was an all healthy type of lettuce wrap! Their filling for the taco was so flavorful and scrumptious! And finally, their nachos... I opted for the cashew cheese sauce and was not disappointed - Crispy chips, gooey 'cheese' sauce, YUM! This restaurant is very small and fills up quickly, but it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My sister and I got the (Raw) Jicama Chili Cheese Fries and the tacos. Both were really good. Big J made our order even though it was nearly closing time which we both appreciated. He was friendly and was happy to tell us about other black-owned businesses nearby. I like the vibe of this place and we are sure to soon be regular customers.  (My sis is in the process of picking up an order as I type this.) Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"You've got to taste the food here to believe how amazing vegan food is! I was greatly surprised! My fianc√© and I shared the ultimate sampler/combo platter 3 which had the zucchini pasta trio, jicama chili cheese fries, nachos grande, the taco, and a chicken salad lettuce wrap. It was the perfect combination of sampler, I had no complaints whatsoever about the food. My only complaint is the door was broken so the air kept blasting on, the air conditioner made it cold and loud. I can't fault them for that though. The platter was certainly big enough to be shared and the price was under $20! Everything was so delicious and flavorful! It was hard to believe the beef was just a vegan protein as it tasted just like seasoned beef. Also the jicama was a pleasant surprise instead of just regular French fries, this place is certainly a healthy place to eat, I loved it! This has become my favorite spot to eat in Container Park, I highly recommend it to not only vegans but to anyone who wants to try a delicious and healthy meal. You will NOT regret it!"}
{"text":"We had the green enchiladas and Asian tacos. Both were delicious and nutritious! The flavors were complex and amazing. Chef Stacy was patient and led us through a tour of the menu before we ordered. She is passionate about her food and it shows. We will be back!"}
{"text":"In the past two weeks, I've turned two religious carnivore eating individuals into semi vegan eating animal lovers - well at least when there at Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan in The Cointainer Park area in Las Vegas.  I've lived in 4 countries, over 15 states and tried every rendition of vegetarian meals. I've been on this journey for 12 years and since living in Las Vegas (8 months) I've almost considered being a waterterian because of the horrid food choices here.  When I came across  Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan - it reminded me of why I became vegetarian. All of the food choices are amazingly fresh and flavorful. The inviting experience of Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan continues when you meet any of the knowledgable staff. They greet you with a smile, a sample and a history lesson on the food. You can tell that take pride in their product and presentation.  Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan sets itself apart because its not one of those excessively hippy and over pretentious spots,  where staff members are forcing the health issue on its patrons - they greet you with an honesty.  I've had every item on the menu and there all delicious, but the nachos w/ mock chicken and guacamole is my go to meal. It has always exceeded my expectations and any carnivore who's skeptical, try the nachos with the mock chicken or crumbles both are irresistible.  If you're looking for variety, you can't go wrong with the well  priced salad bar.  Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan has restored my faith in Las Vegas veggie scene. At this point I never need to find another veggie spot to eat at in Las Vegas, because I am completely satisfied with Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan."}
{"text":"Simply Pure is simply delicious!!!  I'm so excited  Las Vegas finally has an awesome vegan restaurant. Her staff is more than amazing. The service is impeccable.  The food speaks for itself. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a great introduction to quality vegan cuisine."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Fresh pressed Juice cost $8 including tax for 16oz- highest price outside of whole paycheck- I mean- whole foods. Staff is nice. Kale salad is soaking in dressing and everything, although presumably made fresh, has been sitting around in the fridge case with a dry coating over it. I love the idea of fresh healthy quick food, but this is basically a super stripped down whole foods salad bar at $11 per pound. Just returned my second juice because it was all pulp and chewy.  Cashier made me wait for the manager to get back from \"the store\" so she could tell me if they would give me my money back. um.....ok? Gross."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but the food was a bit underwhelming. I went for the \"TLT\" which is a vegan alternative for the BLT. For some reason it only came with the tempeh (vegan bacon alternative) and lettuce and so did my boyfriends sandwich which was also missing tomato. It did taste ok though. The wait was a bit long, when we arrived and ordered there was no one else there but we still had to wait over 30 minutes for our food. I would maybe come back and try something else though as I love the location and they had plenty of vegan options."}
{"text":"Simply Pure's plate of nachos alone is worthy of five stars. A large bed of tortilla chips are bountifully topped with pico de gallo, avocado, savory \"beef\" and ultra tasty cashew \"cheese\" sauce. I must emphasize how delicious the \"beef\" and \"cheese\" are. It tastes like eating junk food. The portion is worth the price, an order can easily be shared by two people."}
{"text":"This place is five stars. Ordered the chicken salad wrap and nachos. Huge portions, had to take it to go, tastes amazing. I can't believe the beef nachos! In a really nice environment at container park."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying vegan nachos with \"beef\" and let me say those were the best damn nachos I ever had. I'm currently trying to go vegan so I'm looking for a cook book from chef Stacey. What a great place though, staff was so friendly and everything looked good on the menu."}
{"text":"I had the Asian tacos and key lime cheesecake. Out of this world good!!!  They offer a lettuce wrap or corn tortilla for the tacos. The first bite was a yummy fennel flavor. A slice of avocado with hot sauce (actually mild) topped this wonderful dish. We're from out of town and I entered \"vegan restaurants in Vegas\", and Simply Pure popped up. We entered the address into our GPS and drove right to it. It's a small shop - seats eight, but there are a lot of tables outside. I highly recommend this little vegan shop."}
{"text":"My first time here, brought my omni gramma, we both loved the food. Everything tasted fresh, I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Little casual restaurant in a shopping eatery area in downtown Vegas.  I am not a vegan but I ordered the lasagna which was really good."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan at all but I fell in love with this place!  The vegan protein and avocado salad are really good but the thing I loved the most was the avocado chocolate mousse! I had to go back and get more! I didn't think vegan food could taste so good until I tried this place."}
{"text":"food here is amazeballs if your are vegetarian, vegan or just want a healthy option. visited 3 times in a week during my recent visit to Vegas. chicken wraps and tacos are DA bomb. their jicama fries are very interesting. juices are refreshing. zucchinigetti and nachos are also YUM! will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"The nachos are so good! Also the owner is as sweet as that amazing chocolate ganache she makes! We had a great meal"}
{"text":"Excellent! Small vegan joint with raw food options - delicious and fresh. Make sure to stop by if you are visiting Vegas, and wondering what to eat besides Chipotle"}
{"text":"Delicious, interesting and filling vegan food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best vegan food in Las Vegas. The nachos and TLT sandwich were delicious. The lasagna was THE best I've ever tasted. Great service, outstanding food."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time today. Had the Grilled TLT (their version of BLT)...DELICIOUS!!!!! Awesome flavor, can't even tell the difference (might even be better than a BLT)! Will be coming back to try everything on the menu! Thank you Stacey!"}
{"text":"I am not vegan or vegetarian but I love this little place. Great location in container park. The lasagna is amazing! I also really like the paninis."}
{"text":"loved everything! we had the sampler plate with the Nachos, zucchini noodles and spring rolls. It's so amazing. We loved everything."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food was fresh and delicious; the service was friendly. We had the #3 sampler so we could try everything. The vegan chicken salad was amazing. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Simply Pure... Simply Delicious!  This is the place to take your non vegan friends to have them experience how amazing vegan food can be.  Vegan nachos?  Yes!!  Jicama 'chili' fries?  More please!  If you're not sure what to order, they even have that solved.  Their sampler plates combine small portions of their favorite items.  A great way to try several entrees at once.   Definitely coming back here again and again."}
{"text":"We eat meat, dairy, gluten and cooked food and still loved this place!  As others have noted, the nachos, spring rolls and jicama were delish. Lots of good choices in Container Park, but I'm sure we'll come back here. Would have been a 5* but wait time was significantly longer than what we were told at ordering.  Update: Thank you for taking the time to read, reply and counsel your staff. My concern was not so much with the length of time it took; my concern is that we were told ten minutes when it took more than a half hour. We would likely not have had an issue with 30+ minutes if we knew that from the getgo"}
{"text":"Small quaint place in container park. Let me just say the food was Amazing! I had the vegan tacos with cashew cheese and it was so delicious! Everyone's plates around us looked scrumptious and something I definitely wanted to try so we will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I'm not a vegan so I  was  little iffy about trying it but I'm so glad I did! I didn't know that vegan food could be so full of flavor! The salad bar is amazing, fresh and new every day. My favorite, I must say, are the vegan nachos. I actually like them better than real nachos! Crazy! The staff is so friendly too. I have never had a bad experience. Be sure to check them out in the Container Park!"}
{"text":"I had the zucchini pasta and one of the juices. Both were really great! Glad there's a place like this in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"so happy to see a new raw vegan spot in Vegas that is doing it right with an organic salad bar full of many flavorful delights, not just your typical salad bar toppings ( my favorite is the marinated mushrooms and the rice noodles) the menu is exciting and enticing: nachos, tacos, lettuce wraps, zuchinni Alfredo pasta, chilli cheese fries!! :) :) I can't wait to try something new. Thank you Chef Stacy!"}
{"text":"Great Food ! Fresh and Tasty! Priced Right too! Try the Grilled Cheese fresh Juices on the Wall"}
{"text":"Well, the Southern Nevada Health District should be ashamed of themselves. Laws can be changed if the community advocated for it. Im sorry that is just disgusting; glad that's not in my community. Have a great day!"}
{"text":"During this trip to Las Vegas, I was excited to try this new vegan restaurant located in Container Park. After all, they are hard to find in Sin City!!  I tried the Mama Mia Lasagna and the Nachos Grande. Both were excellent. The only drawback was that the lasagna was lukewarm."}
{"text":"Simply wonderful!  I dream about those nachos and lasagna.  Really great vegan food that is most definitely light and filling at the same time. I will be back every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant. My partner and i have 2 vegan friends who come to visit twice a year. Brought them to Simply Pure. Not only is the service and cleanliness fantastic i could not believe the quality of the food. It was fresh and hot and we just could not be happier. My partner and I aren't Vegan but......for the Lasagna or Nachos here. We are HOOKED.  Big shout out! Keep those high standards going. Thank you"}
{"text":"Simply pure is delightful! My sister and I were looking for a bite to eat while walking around Container Park. I heard about this place so we had to try. I was amazed! We had the Life is Beautiful Sampler plate. It included  a zucchini pasta trio, vegan nachos, jicama fries, vegan chicken salad wrap, and spring rolls. (I switched the vegan taco out for the spring rolls.) My sister absolutely loved the nachos and zucchini pasta with pesto sauce. My favorite was the spring rolls and the zucchini pasta with cashew sauce! Everything was so flavorful. The salad was very appealing as well. The best part was the service.  Very helpful, warm and welcoming. They let us sample a few things before making our decision and gave us great recommendations of what to try based on what our taste buds were hungry for. We dined on the patio which has a great view of the park. They brought our food to us. Which was also a fabulous touch.  Stellar service and food. I cant wait to go back! Thank you Simply Pure!"}
{"text":"Chef Stacey has a way of making vegan food taste delicious and bursting with flavor. I would recommend it to anyone who may think that eating healthy means giving up the enjoyment of foods that taste good.  Thank you Chef Stacey! ~~Dr. K."}
{"text":"Visiting from Houston and wanted to try and stay on the good foot ( less meat and diary) so we came through. The BLT ( its a TLT -Tempeh) is freaking awesome! Yum ! Nachos good too! Cool vibe, friendly staff! Loved it"}
{"text":"Ehhh, I have to disagree with the positive review on this one... I recommend to go to vegenation a block away or even the Mexican place kiddy corner, 10 steps away. Ok tasting but Overpriced. Also not the nicest service. I came around 3pm and the woman literally looked me up and down. I felt so uncomfortable I left and ended up coming later and there just happened to be new people (and better service)."}
{"text":"simply fabulous!!! outstanding food and service! the owners and staff are amazingly fabulous!!! loved it!!!"}
{"text":"I am far from a Vegan/Vegetarian and thoroughly enjoyed this place. I have never had faux meat tacos before but they were great. I see someone else made a comment about over-salting, mistakes happen, mine were dialed in today. I left fully satisfied and definitely can not wait to return. They have made to order items as well as a salad bar. I practically ran it through the garden and tried most everything from the bar in addition to my tacos. Really good stuff. The people that worked there were extremely friendly and helpful. Please support a place like this."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The girl behind the counter was friendly and spent lots of time explaining what everything was and all the different options we had to order food, she let us try as many samples as we wanted and we asked for a lot! The food was fabulous and really good value for money, it was costed by weight which i'm always wary of but the price was great. I didn't realise vegan could taste so good Everyone should eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent juices & vegan food, the nachos are to die for. Can't go wrong with The Sweetheart it's beets, carrots, celery and apple."}
{"text":"My mother always told me that if I kept living my life this way, I'd end up eating raw spaghetti outside of a recycled shipping container with a fire-breathing praying mantis standing guard, and she was right and I'm glad.  Simply Pure is delicious raw vegan eating, I got sampler #1, featuring their best selling vegan nachos, chik'n salad, and a trio of zucchini spaghettis with Alfredo, pesto, and marinara sauces.  Everything was tasty and made me feel great.  Service was friendly, if not fast (insert raw vegan cooking joke here) but I really enjoyed my meal!"}
{"text":"Stacey is pure amazingness wrapped into her little vegan body. I utilized the Simply Pure private chef services for a romantic date night. When I tell you they changed my entire life! #lifechanger The food was absolute deliciousness! The price I paid for the exceptional services I received, were more than reasonable. If you've ever thought about a private chef service... Fret no more. I just saved your life. Contact Simply Pure. #Stat Thank me later. Oh, and if you stop by the restaurant please do yourself a favor and grab the vegan nachos. I could seriously eat them every single day!  Simply Pure Delightfulness!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area so I decided to finally try the food here!! After looking at all of the reviews and pictures it was hard for me to decide what I wanted to try so the nice young lady who helped me suggested trying the Trio which came with 3 different kinds of \"raw pasta\" pesto, marinara, and a creamy Alfredo. There was a small portion of the nachos and raw chicken salad wrap. There was so much food. Everything was very flavorful. I couldn't decide which pasta I liked the best. I ate them all together... maybe that's why I couldn't decide lol. Next I tried the Nachos... my goodness!! What is that \"cheese\" made of? Its delicious... so much flavor. The nachos were my FAV!! I went back the next day and ordered a full order of just the nachos. By the time I got around to the chicken salad wrap I was already pretty full. They give you a pretty big portions.. you could probably share with someone. I didn't like the chicken salad as much as everything else. I will definitely be coming here again and again..."}
{"text":"The 'chicken' nacho plate... Mmmmm! I'm so glad there's a great vegan place at Container Park in downtown LV."}
{"text":"Being a vegan, I was completely blown away by the flavor that was able to be produced in their food. A must try in my opinion. Veganism rocks!"}
{"text":"How fortunate am I to find this awesome vegan restaurant within walking distance of my hotel?! I am going to eat here for the next 3 nights of my stay here in Vegas! I had the Mama Mia lasagna and it was so good that I ate the entire thing even though it was enough for 2 people. I am a sauce person so I could have used a bit more of it especially because it was so good. I can't wait to try something new tomorrow night! Update: tonight I had the Asian tacos with lime tortilla chips and was again beyond satisfied. Service has been great and contrary to another review the price is VERY reasonable for the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Simply Pure is pure , amazing food, great customer service, and the owner Stephanie is dope and attentive. The Nachos Grande a crowd favorite are good you'll wonder if you are really eating vegan. The Mama Mia Lasanga another crowd favorite is great, mouth watering not dry and the exceeds expectation for a Vegan Lasanga. If you are visiting Vegas or living here in Vegas it's worth the stop."}
{"text":"I'm not VEGAN but my wife and daughter are (don't pray for me, I'm strong, I'll survive them)  Anyway just because I'm not Vegan dosnt mean I don't appreciate good food when I eat it.  1. The Food was very tasty, I'm gonna say excellent (and the tacos were not to salty like some other reviewer said) 2. My wife is Raw and asked a question the cashier wasn't sure of, but the chef must have overheard because he was out in 2 seconds to answer . 3. I'm not sure how good their drinks are, I went down to some BBQ place and got me a beer, so I love the idea in Container park you can kinda mix and match if ya want. D. I'm gonna go back!"}
{"text":"For a first go around this was pretty good. For sure gotta dress up your raw pesto pasta as it's pretty flat otherwise. We added sun dried tomatoes. Think I'll try the marinara next time. Weill for sure be back to try something else. The price is pretty good. People can share it seems like the menu items are large enough to split. The dinning are and place itself is very small. A few two seater tables. We sat outside since the weather was good enough. But you have to be able to stand the loud guy on the mic making announcements and the jazz band playing. .. and the kids running around.. and everything else that comes along with a Saturday in DTLV. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ive tried this place a few times when at container park. The food tastes great but gives us stomach aches. I was surprised to see that no veggies came on the nachos. Im a vegan who actually eats organic/vegan/fluten free/natural so i skip fake processed meats etc.   By the name i thought this place was healthy but after talking to them realized its pretty deceptive. I asked if the food was organic...i mean simply pure to me implies clean food but they said no. I asked well, is it at least non-gmo? They said no. I was a bit shocked. How is food pure if its gmo?   If you dont care about health it tastes great but remember to ask questions and not trust trendy names if you have health concerns.  The location is convenient and container park is fun but i probably wint be back unless they become \"pure\" which is simple, right?"}
{"text":"Such a gem!  The recipies are both innovative, and, tasty!  I'm a huge fan of a couple specific favorites, but, very much look forward to continuing to explore.  I've brought a number of people here who always leave satisfied, and, are often surprised they're eating vegan.  Kudos to the manager who thoroughly, and, patiently explains, and re-explains the menu; add to that, he's running orders all over as people meander to seating themselves about the park.  The rangers tease at my continued stops to container park, but, that's just fine as long as Simply Pure is involved, I'm hooked, and, will keep visiting!"}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian visiting Vegas and needing a heavy meal, this restaurant will work. I ordered a sampler plate and was not terribly impressed. The food was filling, but the \"beef\" tasted like salty textured protein and the vegetable spirals were uncooked. The \"pasta\" would be great for those limiting their diets to raw foods, but it was cold so didn't feel much like a meal to me. The tortilla chips tasted like they came from a supermarket bag.  The staff was kind and the location was great (Container Park)."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and welcoming. The coconut kale salad was the most amazing flavorful bed of greens I have ever tasted. Absolutely phenomenal. Can't wait to go back tomorrow and try something else. And to top it all off, they were playing beautiful and fun reggae music. This place is close to my work. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to find this place. Container park is cute and I love that there's a vegan option. Service was prompt and the man was very friendly. We ordered a sampler plate and juice. It took maybe 10-15 to receive our food which isn't bad at all. Everything tasted amazing. Zoodles were delicious.  The lettuce wraps were very good, one better than the other. And the nachos were probably the best.  Things I didn't love was the amount of jicama in the nachos. They were very large chunks and I'd rather have more chips. Just my personal preference. I also would have loved for my juice to be cold. I juice a lot of home and put mine in the fridge for about an hour before serving and there's just something more refreshing about that, but the juice was still bomb in flavor. Lastly, it's expensive. For the sampler, juice and tip we paid $40 but it wasn't enough food for two. We read *two plates on the board assuming it should be shared but we could have enjoyed having our own. Our mistake, but I'm glad I didn't order two of them mostly because of the price."}
{"text":"I am not vegan or vegetarian but Simply Pure is and you will not miss meat or dairy. The dishes are amazing. The nachos are unreal most people would never believe they were eating vegan if you didn't tell them. Great service too!"}
{"text":"I love this gem I've stumbled upon at the Container Park in Downtown Fremont. The menu is short and simple. The ingredients, super fresh. The staff was very kind and courteous. The food, it was AMAZING! I plan to come back here and go through everything on the menu. Love their well seasoned mock meats."}
{"text":"Simply Pure is great and has lots of options!!! Vegan Lasagna and fresh juice. Get a TLC-apples cucumber lemon and mint yesssss a Great place for healthy food and great service."}
{"text":"The lasagna was amazing!  2 blocks from Fremont street, who would have thought?  :)"}
{"text":"Chef Stacey is the queen of vegan Mac n cheese! Her vegan cheese in general is phenomenal! My favorite is the nachos, her raw items are great too! Overall great spot to get amazing vegan food for all."}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas, please go somewhere different --¬†you've got so many better options. Important: They currently have a B health grade (more below).  My husband and I are both vegans who enjoy visiting Vegas and the many delicious restaurants at the Wynn and Encore. This time we thought we'd leave the strip and check out the Fremont area.   We happened upon this place soon before we had to leave the Container Park for the airport and decided to split a BLT for a last snack.   After we had paid, I noticed this place had a B health rating. My husband has worked in the food industry and tells me you can be a pretty gross place and still get an A, so this was disturbing. If I had noticed it before we paid, I probably wouldn't have eaten there. So be warned... this place is dirty.  Also after we placed the order, the girl working said, \"It's going to take about 15 minutes, is that okay?\" I have no idea why it would take 15 minutes to make the sad sandwich we were about to receive, the restaurant was pretty empty, but we said fine.  Fifteen minutes later, we received a couple barely-panini'd pieces of bread with some tempeh bacon inside that I don't think was cooked. The bacon was cold and not charred/browned in any way. Unappetizing. Then there was a tiny bit of lettuce and tomato, plus a glop of vegan mayo. The sandwich looked like something I'd make at home while in the middle of a conference call, half-heartedly paying attention to what I was doing.  There was hardly anyone else inside ordering food, so I don't know what took so long to get this. Don't go here expecting good service.  We scarfed the sandwich down since we needed a little snack before a night of travel. But I regretted spending my calories on this, when the day/night before I'd enjoyed delicious vegan sushi, pasta, and much more at other Vegas establishments."}
{"text":"It took over 15 minutes to get my juice. I ordered the Liquid Courage: kale, spinach, parsley, and cucumber. Out of all 4 ingredients clearly the cucumber is going to be the main source for juice. As I drank it, it tasted like the cucumber was sitting in water. No remnants of kale, spinach and parsley. Those typically are bitter tasting and I couldn't taste any of it. So disappointed. $7 gone."}
{"text":"Loving the new first floor location and update menu.  The new updated menu has raw and cooked items.  Yum!"}
{"text":"One star for the grande nachos: great portion, but the beef crumbles were too salty. For 3:30 pm, this was a pretty weak choice for what I thought was going to be a life changing lunch experience. Nope. I was met with attitude and disinterest by a half yelling employee and her friend. They were incessantly ranting about how they hate their job with her best friend sitting by the chalkboard menu. They weren't holding back. On top of that the cashier/cooking did not start my order of nachos until I walked back inside the pod-sized restaurant because my boyfriend and I couldn't handle their obnoxious complaining. I was given the excuse by the friend that she went next door to get ingredients. I watched her flail for 10 minutes before I had to say something."}
{"text":"I love the food here- when I first saw the tiny place, I thought it was just a salad bar and I was not interested. They have such a bigger menu than I expected though. Everything I've had here is delicious! And Chef Stacey is so friendly. If you like healthy, organic, raw food- go!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate dinner here and ordered the Ultimate Sampler to share. It was more than enough food for the 2 of us and everything was delicious! Stacey is a fantastic chef!! Our favourite dishes from the sampler were the nacho grande and the jicama chili cheese fries - wow were they ever tasty!! We also had a \"cheesecake\" with strawberry topping that was very good as well.  We are looking forward to having dinner here again on our next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food here is great if you willing to wait an eternity. Ordered the nachos with the cashew cream. We waited 45 MINUTES to get it and I started to wonder if they were hand-making the chips or something. Every single customer in the cafe was frustrated, luckily the weather outside was nice to keep the rage down. The food is great maybe if you do takeout or something.. it may be worth it but we had to add money twice to or parking spot. Not worth it-do NOT waste your time."}
{"text":"So yummy . I could eat here everyday . Great service always polite. Everyone I bring here loves the food. My personal favorite are the nachos with cashew cheese sauce , omg!!! You must try ."}
{"text":"So I must admit..... I am not vegan...but this place makes me think... Maybe I could live without cheese!!! I am currently obsessed with a vegan YouTube channel called hot for food. She has a recipe for nacho cheese sauce that looks just like nacho cheese sauce... But I thought... Prob tastes nothing like cheese. So when I saw that they made nachos with vegan nacho cheese sauce I thought... I want to try it and see... \" can you tell... That its vegan\".... I can honestly say... Damn!!!! I had to go in and ask if she gave me the wrong sauce.... It's a creamy cashew nut nacho cheese sauce.... And damn!!! It's so good! Tangy, cheesy not such how they do it! But it's really great! Also their vegan\"beef\" is also great! Check out this awesome place... Even if you sent vegan just so you can see... They eat awesome too!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food here!  I tried one of the platters, totally worth the money to try different things.  I wish the jicama fries were cooked but they were still yummy."}
{"text":"Simply Pure is simply Awesome! Love the workers who put in hard work in getting our food prepared. It does take time to prepare a meal when there is only 1 employee working. So, much respect to that brother. Much love to all the workers and Stacey for sharing her healthy recipes to the public. The price is worth it, health wise. I much rather buy a 11$ raw vegan salad than a 5$ fake salad at McDs.. But I'm seeing a lot of inpatient reviews and well if you're not use to eating raw I would suggest the Nachos Grande. Thanks Simply Pure staff for all your hard work. :)"}
{"text":"Good quality food located right in the container park. Small menu, which is not a bad thing. They make great juices as well. The Vegan Tacos and the TLT Panini were tasty. Not sure I will be craving this place but it was good."}
{"text":"My first stop every time I come to LV - this is unreal. As a former meat enthusiast this scratches my itch for a hearty, protein packed meal that doesn't make you feel like crap afterwards.  So, so good. Nachos are a no brainier !"}
{"text":"Absolutely love his place and come here often ... But sometimes it's slow . So if you are In a hurry it will take longer to get order if it's one person taking orders and cooking :/ will be back next week when I have a good hour to spend on lunch :) try the raw tacos !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Driving back hungry to Los Angeles from Utah, it was desperation that had me looking at vegan/vegetarian restaurants on Yelp. On my iPhone. Somehow, it didn't register to me that this was a RAW establishment. I am not a fan of raw food. It isn't typically my practice to eat RAW. So as far as I know, this might be the best raw food on the planet. I didn't enjoy eating it or paying so much for it. We waited a very long time for them to prepare the food. Too long. We ordered I think three entrees and two side dishes and drinks and ended up paying about $90 bucks with tip.  No servers. No plates. No metal forks. This is take out.  Chef Stacey is not the one in the kitchen making these meals. I think she should do more on her Yelp listing to stress that this is raw, uncooked food.  \"Fries\" should be called \"Jicama Fries\" and so forth. The pictures can be very deceiving. The portions are fairly large but if you're not into raw food, a huge portion of \"fries\" made from cold Mexican turnips is bad mojo.  I originally rated this at two stars. I've added a star back since it was my mistake to come to a raw food place when I didn't want to. But ...   If I were a betting man, I'd bet that I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is so disorganized. No place to wait. HUGE wait times. I was told 20 minutes after I paid, but it took 42 minutes. Good food but to have a business you have to be realistic. To wait the better part of an hour for getting deli style food is a little ridiculous. The table next to me didn't get what they ordered but didn't complain because by that time they were just hungry.  *update in response to owner's comment below.  There were 4 employees. Small place like that I'd wonder where more could be. And the owner Stacy was my checkout person, heard (and looked right at me) when I asked for an update at double the time she told me it would take, and the person that handed my food to me. She knew exactly what was happening. A simple 'I'm sorry for your wait' would have been respectful, free and taken no time."}
{"text":"The nachos here are the best. I will definitely be back next week to try something new.  Frist time trying vegan food and I was beyond impressed.  Plus it's a cozy and nice setting to sit in and just relax."}
{"text":"Super small all vegan eatery, so be patient.  Many people purchasing food here seemed to call in their order, which makes sense.  It's located in the Container Park, so you might be moseying around and just want to pick it up and eat outside.  The people eating here seemed to want the nachos - yes, me too!  Who doesn't want nachos?  They looked amazing, but, I avoided the heavy nature that day.... but if I am back in Vegas, this is probably one of the first things I will want to eat.  They have an amazing selection of gluten-free and raw foods, as well as juices, aside from \"traditional\" vegan food.  Zucchini noodles here are beautiful, so opt for having the trio in the platter/ sampler, because otherwise, how can you pick the sauce/ topping you want?  They have kale chips, but sometimes they don't - they run out.  They make everything from scratch, so, yes, for a small shop, they may run out of items.  Spring rolls are good easy choices.  The most amazing thing I ate here was the Chik'n Salad Lettuce Wraps - all raw, nut-based, lettuce wrapped edible brilliance.   This was my favorite by far, and I am dreaming about it from afar.  The best part about this place is you will come here for \"comfort\" and familiar food, and see what other people eat/order, and be inspired or induced into ordering more.  The dessert (cheesecake) is alright, but nothing stupendous.  I would rather have nachos!  Overall, this place is a little gem in the Container Park.  I would be back here in a heartbeat - and definitely order ahead, grab it to go, so I don't end up staying and ordering more food!"}
{"text":"Stacey's craft is amazing. She catered my reception and everyone loved the food even though none of them are vegans, nor did most of them care about eating organic. I was so thrilled to find Stacey and utilize her services! She's great to work with and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is situated in this unique Park area.  Would have been nice to eat outside,  but given the rugged hest I enjoy a nice meal indoors.  Tried the vegan enchaladas, they were to die for.  Would eat here again if I ever return to Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! What a gem! The nachos are absolutely delicious! Had the pleasure of meeting and speaking with the owner who is absolutely lovely. If you're looking for good food definitely check this place out. Went with 2 non vegan friends of mine who equally enjoyed their meals. Great food, great staff. 5 stars all around from me"}
{"text":"Okay. Came here with my baby nephew today. And oh my god. This place is AMAZING!!!!!!!!! So delicious, so flavorful. Everyone is so nice and sweet I met the owner and chef she is awesome! So happy I came here. I got a salad (create your own) and I also got a little sample of the dessert truffle. My nephew is 1 and he absolutely loved it. I wish I bought a dozen of them lol. I will deff come back to this place! I love the avocados wish I knew how it was made so good!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Downtown on our trip (we're from Belgium) and we found this vegan caf√©. I ordered The first sample platter (zucchini pasta/nachos/\"chicken\" salad) and it was UH-MAZE-BALLS. It was SO GOOD. I'd like to move this place to Europe."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! This food was delicious, really the best food we had in a while. We got the nachos and lasagna, absolutely great!! Would stop here next time I'm in vegas! it's downstairs, kind of hidden."}
{"text":"Mind officially blown.  If I could experience this every day for the rest of my life I would officially become a vegan.  Lasagna, awesome.  Green chili enchiladas, delicioso, nachos..not one bad thing to say. Excellent meal."}
{"text":"I came here last week and ordered the regular tacos on a tomato tortilla. It was okay, but there wasn't anything special about it. I could have probably made this in 5 minutes. I wasn't impressed. I might go back and try something else, but for now it was forgettable."}
{"text":"Try the nachos! I want to try something else but I can't stop ordering the nachos! If you're hesitant to try raw food, don't be. I was and I was so wrong. The nachos are hot and delicious. You'd never know. The staff is friendly and there's indoor seating if it's too hot to sit outside. Try them out!"}
{"text":"I stopped in Vegas en route to st George to go mountain biking.  We were looking for some good healthy food and we stopped here. The food was awesome we ordered the lasagna and the tacos. Felt healthy and filling at the same time. One mistake that a lot of retaurants make is to try to make the \"meat\" taste like real meat. I didn't get that here, vegetables and nuts have a lot of good texture and flavor when done right. Coming from the San Francisco Bay Area we have a lot of vegan restaurants and this one would fit right in."}
{"text":"I'm so impressed by this little restaurant! Everything that I have tried has been incredible and well worth the price and wait. My favorites from Simply Pure are the:  Chicken lettuce wraps- so fresh, flavorful and filling. If you're wanting something light and delicious this one is a winner. Tastes great in the lettuce wrap and if you dip tortilla chips in it.   Nachos- I think it would be fun if they added some beans or maybe a couple extra veggies but its still delicious and something I come back for regardless of simplicity.   Lasagne- HUGE portion of yummyness here! All of the flavors are on point in my opinion and it's no wonder why this one is a crowd favorite.   The kale and cranberry salad- I never thought kale could taste so good... really. Raw kale is something that without proper pairing can be bitter and over powering. But, Chef Stacy has worked her magic into creating a beautiful array of balanced flavors with this gorgeous salad! Not to mention you get a heaping portion for the price (much like literally everything Simply pure has to offer)!  TLC fresh pressed juice is my JAM! Really need some self control so I don't drink it all in one sitting.   Just as a tip, seating is limited! I hope some day Chef Stacy can open up a full sized restaurant! She deserves it. Until then? Don't be sad if there's no where to sit... just means the food is THAT GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food that you wouldn't think was vegan. The service is great. They had samples for people during Life is Beautiful and they won me over with just one bite! The chocolate ganache was amazing too. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband, my friend and his gf. we ordered the TLT, lasagna and cashew cheese nachos. My friend and his gf are not vegetarians or vegans but they absolutely loved the food.The lasagna was my fave but def too big. it's really best to be split between 2 ppl.   the only 2 things that make this place not 5 stars are: 1) the restaurant is VERY small.  2) they create a lot of trash by using paper plates and plastic cutlery and cups. While i'm not sure if they recycle or not, it's quite unnecessary to use disposable items.    That said, the food was top notch with friendly service. would def come back"}
{"text":"Vegan dining... hmmm I'll give it a try.   Simply Pure is located in the Container Park on the second level.  Beware it's next to JinJu Chocolates and it's hard to resist that! Ha!   I went with a friend who is a much healthier eater than I.  I would love to be as healthy as her so was more than happy to meet her there.  They have a simple and small menu.  This was fine to just get a taste.  I went with the Thai basil spring rolls made with noodles, cabbage and carrots wrapped in rice paper. These were tasty with the accompanied sweet chili lime dipping sauce.  I'd order those again without any hesitation.   I also tried the Nachos Grande made with vegan beef, vegan cheese, pico and avocado.  Now this was different.  The entree is served cold.  I was educated on 'Raw' eating where things aren't heated up.   They weren't too bad and didn't mind the vegan beef and cheese.  I just would have liked them more with some heat.   Service was ok but it did take them a while to prepare our food.  Since I'm not vegan I can't really compare tastes and flavors to other places.  From this meat eater, it's ok."}
{"text":"This is my go to, healthy, feel good, place for indulgence. For all the vegans out there this place is amazing! I am a vegetarian myself who enjoys seafood from time to time, but with a place like this it would be so easy to go vegan. Chef Stacey has amazing, mouthwatering recipes. My all time favorite are the nachos and the tacos. The location is also pretty cool as it is in Downtown Las Vegas at the  container park. I've even taken some of my meat eating friends who enjoys this place quite a bit."}
{"text":"I paid 20 bucks for a panini sandwich And the green drink. the food is good , but the place is overrated and overpriced"}
{"text":"Simply Pure was the first vegan restaurant I've ever been to in Vegas. I was attending the Las Vegas Academy which is right up the street from the restaurant and I had stumbled across this tiny place. I glanced at the menu and decided to try the vegan tacos. I've been in love with those tacos ever since. The 4 tacos come on a crisp piece of lettuce and have well seasoned vegan meat topped off with this delicious vegan cheese, avocado, and pico de gallo. I don't order the avocado or the peco de gallo on it because I'm a picky eater, but my friends tell me it's yummy. I've been to Simply Pure at least 15 in the past 2 years. All I can say is that it's SIMPLY amazing (pun intended). I'm super picky so that fact that they can put a smile on my face says a lot. Its the perfect spot for any people vacationing in Las Vegas it's in the downtown area, located in Container Park.  Would definitelt enjoy it too. Simply Pure has my heart and my stomach for sure."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Simply Pure on a recent trip to Vegas. In a city overwhelmed with decadence, it was surprising and refreshing to find a clean and nutritious meal option!   The shop is on the ground-level section of Container Park with limited indoor seating, but a fair amount of outdoor seating shared with surrounding businesses. It appeals to grab-and-go clientele.   The menu had plenty of options including juices, sweets, and savory entrees. Prices were reasonable but higher than expected given that the produce is non-organic. I tried the Pure Angel (apple, carrot, ginger, cucumber) made fresh to order. Slow wait - but great taste!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this place three stars. But this is my second time here and both times it just feels like an unfriendly environment. Not a welcoming establishment. First experience, I found this business online, saw that I can call my order in, which is great because I was at work and needed to order for a few of us. After the lady takes my order she tells me I have to use my card in order to process the order. I wasn't about to do that when I had all this cash. So I came in and ordered. The cashier didn't say hello, or make me feel welcomed at all. She spoke monotone as if she were annoyed I was there. Then I sat down waited so long for my food. Listening to the cook get on the cashier over every possible thing. So I could imagine why she wasn't to pleasant. It took an hour possibly more for my food to finish.   My second visit, today. Well, again, another pleasant cashier. People like to be welcomed into an establishment for that all around great experience. This place lacks that big time. They are understaffed as well so the cashier has to leave to grab food while someone waits in line to order and the food take a while to be made.  I come here because of how amazing the food is. By far one of my most favorite vegan food restaurants in Vegas. So I do recommend eating here. Just don't expect to be welcomed when you come in. Or the people to be friendly. They just get the food made and get you outta there."}
{"text":"Great Vegan restaurant. You will not be disappointed. Wish that I lived closer so that I could eat their more often."}
{"text":"This is a tiny place with only a few tables, you order at the counter. The girl working at the counter seemed to have a bit of a bad attitude even though she tried to be friendly. It didn't enhance our experience to overhear her complaining about working there to her co-worker.  We started with one of the sampler platters. My boyfriend said the taco was absolutely delicious, the kale chips were really good, and the jicama chili fries were very good. It was a good amount of food for the price. Next, I had the lasagna, it was delicious! A huge portion for the price. My boyfriend had the panini which he raved about being the best thing on the menu. We had the cheesecake for desert.  The cheesecake was incredible so delicious and creamy!! It was almost too good to really be vegan!!! I would eat here again if it was warm enough to eat outside. I would go here for lunch not dinner, as I prefer table service for dinner. I would skip the sampler platter, maybe order the fries as an appetizer, the lasagna and definitely the cheesecake!!!"}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant ...there was the WORST MUSIC on..I felt as if I was at a Mega Death Concert...I was not greeted with warmth at the Counter...service and Music was horrid...but the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Raw vegan food at the Container Park. Stacey Dugan's dishes are tasty, but may be an acquired taste for some. The menu, like the storefront, is small- a few entrees, a couple of sides, plus juices and salad bar options.   There are only four juices ($7/16oz), but I was pleased with the two I tried: TLC (lemon, lime, mint, cucumber, apple) being the favorite, with a light and refreshing flavor, while the High Octane (beets, carrots, cucumber, ginger) was balanced but less sweet.  Favorite dish to get here is the raw tacos: vegan ground beef with taco seasonings, topped with pico de gallo and avocado slices, wrapped in Romaine lettuce leaves and served with a side of tortilla chips. The leaves are stuffed with plenty of filling, and can get a bit messy. The chips were great for scooping up the excess. Unfortunately, the jicama chili cheese \"fries\" were not a hit with my guy and the cold crunch paired with the chili and cheese toppings just didn't work for me. As Bethany put it, I think I would have enjoyed this more if it were heated.   Service from Stacey was polite, drinks and dishes were made to order. I would come back here for juices or the lettuce wraps, but pricing is a bit on the high side for those who don't require the vegan/raw dining, around $13/entr√©e. She does have some plates available that are a bit higher but allow you to try three or four menu items.  Note that the storefront is small and does not have seating- there are shaded tables and chairs throughout the Container Park area, but in the middle of a Vegas summer, you may prefer to grab and go somewhere with air conditioning."}
{"text":"I have felt like such a naughty vegan simply because this was the one vegan spot in Las Vegas I haven't been too. After much hype I finally made it down their and all I can say is that I am ashamed at myself for not going their sooner. Since I went with several people we each ordered something different to share and I wish I would have ordered one of everything to eat for myself! I ordered the lasagna since I have heard a ton of rave reviews about it and it lived up to every expectation. The only downside is that the space is tiny, but expected since it's in a shipping container, however if the weather is nice enough then sitting outside would be perfect!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh vegan food! Even for carnivores, this place is delicious. The vegan nachos are a great example.   It's a build your own salad format, so you pay by the pound. However, it's amazing how much food you get for the price.  The food is freshly prepared onsite. If no one is at the register, they're just behind the small wall in the kitchen. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Super good place! Ordered the sampler #1 and subbed the nachos for spring rolls. My friend ordered the lasagna. Very fresh, everything was delicious. I would highly recommend to check this place out if you're in the area and want to eat something to feel good about!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Las Vegas and I am amazed at the outstanding number of vegan/vegetarian restaurants. I planned on taking my daughter to Container Park for the first time and was looking online for dinner options for myself. I was so excited when I found out about Simply Pure and couldn't wait to give it a try. Once we got there and the time rolled around I grabbed my daughter something to eat from one of the restaurants downstairs and got situated with her. I decided to go up stairs and get my food from Simply Pure. I asked the gentleman working what was the best thing to eat at Simply Pure and he told me the Raw Nachos. Which I was a little taken back by because chips are not raw. I decided to give it a shot any ways. After I ordered and paid the gentleman told me it would be 20-25 minutes because there were about 5 orders ahead of mine. I placed the order at 5:19pm. I said okay and went back down to where my daughter and father were eating. At 5:38pm I decided to head back up to see if my food was done yet. I waited another 15-18 minutes for my food. While I was in the store for the remainder of the time waiting on my food which was now taking almost double what I was told, another worker and I am assuming what is her boyfriend came in with a big box of produce. I thought yes someone to help this poor man working by himself. Well I was wrong. All she did was ask a few customers if they had been helped and then proceeded to make her boyfriend a wrap. I have worked in the food service industry for years and that is a huge NO NO. She did not help her co worker she helped herself and then left. You just don't do that sort of thing in front of customers EVER. After she left and I was still waiting the owner called in and the man working picked up the phone and told her that nothing had been prepped the shift before and that and that someone should be called in to do it. Judging by his frustration the owner said no. Which is also a huge NO NO when you want to run a well organized small company. If your workers call in and say I need extra help now you better get your ass down there and help them. That is how a well run small business is supposed to work. I ended up getting my nachos at around 5:57pm or so. When I sat down and ate them I was actually shocked because usually good food takes time and I do understand that and I am more than willing to wait. These on the other hand were not good AT ALL. The vegan protein tasted like it had been way over seasoned with cumin and the sauce had a very strange taste. I did not realize until it was too late that the nacho cheese that they offer had to be ordered separately so I did not get that. I am assuming that would have been better than the sauce that was on there. On the menu it says that it comes with avocado. It should say that it comes with 3 small strips of avocado which to me was not enough. Over all service was bad food was bad. The moral of the story here is that if you are the owner of a small company you have to have an invested stake in your workers and your company even when YOU ARE NOT PRESENT. With that being said I would not recommend this place to anyone and I certainly wont be back. I am in no way shape of form saying it was the gentleman working who was at fault but the owner."}
{"text":"Big portions, tiny interior.  Overall the food was good-ish and light.  +1 star if you're vegan I guess.  The veggie/fruit juice was underwhelming though."}
{"text":"Food was great. As non vegetarian I found the food flavorful and light. Ordered a sample plate #1. It came with three pastas. A pesto , alfredo and a regular marinara pasta. Also came with the most noted on yelp the nachos and a meatless taco.  All three where great. Plate was big saved the rest for a second lunch. Nachos come in a whole or half order by themselves. Definatly a must try. Hard to choose a favorite all where a great introduction to simply pure. Service was fast. Food was great. Xoxoxo"}
{"text":"Excellent Vegan food.  We needed to stop for food on our way from Utah to San Diego, and found this on Google.  It was one of the best vegan places we have visited, and Stacey was a wonderful host to us."}
{"text":"Fast service and yummy food! The pasta sauces were a little off in taste, but the other dishes I tried were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"1. Stacey is amazingly friendly and helpful 2. The food is delicious - I've now had the mock chicken lettuce rape as well as the tacos and I loved every bite. 3. Entrees run a little over  $10 which is more than I'd like but worth it 4. Next time I go I think I'm going to get a few things from the raw food bar!"}
{"text":"Simply Pure is in my personal Top 5 plant based Vegas restaurants, and as a one-time local I've tried em all at least once.  Highest marks for the cheesecake and the nachos. Everything is fresh. Friendly service, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Was visiting downtown Las Vegas for the Scars & Stripes festival & wanted to grab a meal first. Even with it being as hot as it was, Stacey assured me the vegan lasagna is a must try. I am a fan of lasagna so without hesitation I stopped in and ordered it. I was greeted when I first walked in by friendly cashiers waiting to take my order. They informed me the wait would be about 25 minutes. I said that's perfectly fine. I appreciate they take the time to prepare a meal without just throwing it in the microwave. When the lasagna arrived it was a large portion enough to share with someone else along with a side salad. The salad was a nice portion of mixed greens with a really complimenting dressing. Refreshing!!! The Lasagna was full of flavor. I really enjoyed the different ingredients combined which complimented each other well in this dish. You can tell she put some thought into creating this. It was hearty, great tasting, and large enough to share with someone. Being vegan you often times find lasagna just whipped together with a tasteless pasta sauce, but not this one. I have enjoyed every meal I've had from this caf√©. Always friendly service, healthy fresh food, and it's a cute little spot to come grab a bite and sit down in the park."}
{"text":"After my 5th time going, and bringing my co-worker to this amazing staple in Downtown Las Vegas, I can truly honestly say this is the best VEGAN RESTAURANT IN DTLV! Vegan Nachos, Lasagna, Vegan Tacos, Grilled cheese w/pesto/tomato....so many dishes to enjoy and worth the investment. Chef Stacey is awesome and her staff is just as awesome and personable as well! I can't wait to fill up my punch card and it's awesome to order thru Yelp as well. TRY THIS PLACE OUT NOW!"}
{"text":"It's okey! Pricey for what it is and the location. It's inconvenient to come eat here. You have to pay for parking. The juice was good but for a vegan place I was hoping more on the salads menu."}
{"text":"Let's start off with the food.. I think I've had just about everything on the menu and nothing disappoints. Personal favorite would definitely be the lasagna. I saw that a lot of people complain about the wait time but I've never had a problem. But if you're going to get the lasagna I would recommend calling in they usually tell you it takes 20 mins in the oven. The staff is amazing and always friendly.People don't understand that they are always busy and have a really small kitchen so sometimes you have to wait a minute for someone to come to the front it's not because they're ignoring you they are just workingggggggg there buts off. As far as seating there are a couple tables inside but for freak sake you are at container park go enjoy your food outside at one of the tables."}
{"text":"I love this place the food and atmosphere of this place is awesome the people are very nice love it that it's located in the container park downtown the staff at simply pure are always pleasant. My favorite is the lasagna and the nachos"}
{"text":"Loved the many gluten free options, and the food was amazing!  Definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I been a fan of Chef Stacey since her catering days.  EVERYTHING she makes is wonderful and will have you craving for more. The nachos are outstanding, even so that I can get two meat-loving preteens to beg me to take them back for more.  I've always been weary of kale chips until I tried hers. Crazy seasoning and a depth of flavors made we want them over my usual seaweed/nori snacks.   If you want food that looks good, tastes good and IS GOOD FOR YOU, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Food: I am a transitioning vegetarian, so trying this place was a must. Had the vegan tacos. Very good, although I did find the \"meat\" a bit on the over seasoned side. Besides that, very good dish. Spring rolls were good as well.  Decor: This establishment is located on the second floor of Container Park, so it's a bit cramped inside the shop itself (no fault of theirs). Outside balcony seating is abundant, with plenty of people watching to be had.  Service: Service was excellent. The gentleman that helped us was very polite, explained the food options, and even brought our food to us on the balcony. Afterwards, he offered us samples of their chocolate ganache. His efforts were validated, as I left with a take home serving of the desert."}
{"text":"I don't live in Vegas but anytime I'm going to pass through I plan my trip so I get to eat here! The lasagna is to die for! My husband and I love the nachos! Make sure you get them with the cashew cheese! I can't wait to try more of the food but I just keep going back to these old favorites!"}
{"text":"My fave are the pastas paninis nachos and enchiladas from here taste great always friendly service"}
{"text":"Very nice spot in Downtown Las Vegas , outdoor with pleasant music and seating area. We appreciated the fact that there are no gambling machines around and came out all the way from the Strip to find some healthy and vegan food - it was worth the taxi trip! Reminds us very much of the Wynwood Yard in Miami. Lovely playground for children and small little shops and eateries in container locations. Delicious food, although the Lasagna was not super hot we enjoyed the friendly service and quality ingredients.  We would definitely come back when we re-visit Las Vegas! Good luck to Chef Stacey Dougan!"}
{"text":"Out of towners. This was our first stop. So pleased. We ordered the ultimate sampler. Nachos and enchilada was our fav's. Wish we could've gotten the lasagna too. Great environment, set in the very cool container park. Dont miss this one. Try it for lunch, then take a walk around for some shopping."}
{"text":"Best Vegan in town... even as a meater I am a returning client! Try one of the combos and you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Monday night for a first time visit. I was super excited to discover this place via Yelp and couldn't wait to drop by. I loved the gourmet salad bar and the fact that I could sample anything from it for free. Great idea for first-timers. Since this is the first vegan eatery I'd ever been to, I decided on the ultimate sampler in an attempt to try as much as possible. Everything in the ultimate sampler was delicious!  From the zucchini noodles to the tacos, and the nachos and jicama fries in between, it was all amazing. I cannot wait to revisit and will definitely return in the future, as well as tell all my vegan, vegan-friendly and vegan-curious friends to stop by.  The service was great; friendly, helpful, and prompt. They even have a military discount. Awesome eatery!"}
{"text":"It is really 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding to the 4 stars for the effort.  Tiny \"hole in the wall\" place located inside the Container Park. The place is really small, capable to accommodate may be 10 people inside - however, there are also outside tables.  The restaurant serves vegan food, so all references to \"chicken\" etc. only imply vegan dish with resembles chicken (or other protein) in appearance and flavor.  We ordered an ultimate sampler, which included zucchini pasta trio (3 different sauces), nacho Grande, Chicken salad lettuce, vegan taco and jicama cheese fries. I really liked nacho grande, which had perfect taste profile of the actual \"loaded\" nachos. Chicken salad lettuce was also very tasty. We had chocolate cheesecake for dessert, which was not bad, but was lacking the smoothness and richness of the actual cheesecake. There is not that much of the regular service to comment on, as the restaurant is very tiny.  Interesting place to try."}
{"text":"I've looked this place up on Yelp before and had it bookmarked. Recently there was a little vegan village food truck fest and they had a booth. At the veg fest I tried the Lasagna and the Nachos and they were fucking BOMB! SOOO I finally made my way down to the actual spot in container park.  Initially when you walk in, it's a tiny little joint with about three tables inside. There's a board with different juices and smoothies on it and then the cashier asked us if we wanted to see the full menu. There are tables right outside and all around so we ended up ordering the Sampler platter and sat outside and enjoyed the weather. There was a zucchini pasta trio, nachos grande, jicima fries, lettuce wrapped taco, and a chicken lettuce wrap. Everything was fucking great, although I wasn't a huge fan of the jicima fries, I did really enjoy everything else, especially those Nachos again!"}
{"text":"The food here is so flavorful and fresh. Seriously, buy all the kale chips you can because they do not last long. I crave the raw Alfredo all the time. I'm not vegetarian. I rarely eat the healthiest of  meals.  Thank you for making delicious food that's actually good me. The service is always great."}
{"text":"This is a late review. We were there June 2014 and had raw angel zucchini pasta with pesto. Great food , flavor profile and concept! Wish they have a better indoor seating area. This place would be great for a fast food or takeout. We would love to try other food on the menu next time!"}
{"text":"Probably the tastiest healthiest food I've ever had in Las Vegas! It's a little hole in the wall in a cool little Plaza in downtown area. We had that sampler number 3 and an order of spring rolls and everything was amazing. Love the nachos and zucchini pasta. Will definitely hit this place again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I'm trying to figure out how you can get so much flavor from vegan items. Welp, I don't have to figure it out. The cats at Simply Pure already did the hard work. All I had to do was eat! I enjoyed it. I will definitely bring people here! Thanks, Chef Stacey!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. This place is freaking fantastic. The pesto panini is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. And the cheesecake. Oh sweet salvation, the cheesecake..."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here... we were blown away by the food and how delicious it was. We aren't vegans, but this place changed the way I look at vegan food. Everything was AWESOME!!! Stacey, Great Job!!!"}
{"text":"So glad DT has a great vegan place to check out whenever I'm in the area. Food is good, however a bit salty. I will though be back to try more. I do love the fact that it's international dishes turned vegan. International dishes have so much punch in flavor!   Service: 5/5 Info was explained so well, I was more so shocked rather than listening. Comparing this place to Greens & Proteins, this place is so much better at service.   Presentation: 5/5 I did a take out, and even the take out box is loud. That's a good thing by the way. When your food looks good and you have a good looking take out box, I believe you'll look good too! Portion of the vegan nachos were just right and filling too! Chinapoblano at Cosmo need to come down and take a lesson about portions from Chef Stacey, because this is the size people eat!   Taste: 4/5 As a vegan chef, I tend to cook with loud spices that have my clients look out to the horizon with a confused look on their face trying to guess what it is. Chef Stacey did this with the nachos. I did find the vegan protein a bit salty as I devoured the dish. The nice size portion of the avocado smoothed out the saltiness though. Thankfully I had a bottle of water on hand too.   Overall: 5/5 A great place to indulge and check out if you're in the area. Great location for both locals and visitors. Prices do match the portions so you're getting what you pay for, which most \"hip\" vegan establishments or venues who cater to vegan often miss.   Tips:  Parking - Park at El Cortez on Ogden & 6th. There are two separate garages, one for hotel guests and non hotel guests.   If you can't find a close enough parking spot, just park and walk. DT streets take getting used to, plus one street was closed off for an event, so it made getting to the other side a bit frustrating."}
{"text":"First time visiting this location, located in Downtown Container Park! I ordered the Nachos Grande and TLC juice drink. Both were delicious and filling. I feel as though the customer service can be improved and the wait time is for those with patience. However, it's worth the wait with the outcomes that arrive to your table. I enjoyed my time and meal!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Very tasty place. Everything was amazing. And we're not even vegan lol highly recommended. Will defiantly be back soon!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend Tami recommended this place to me as I have a very sensitive system and eating out usually upsets my stomach.  She mentioned how natural all the ingredients were.  I ordered the Lasagna, and oh my lanta it was not only the best Vegan Lasagna I've ever had, but quite frankly the best lasagna period!!!!  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"After the disappointment from eating at a nearby vegetarian restaurant I was skeptical about trying this place, but boy was I wrong! We ordered their nachos and the sampler number #2. The nachos are soooo good that you'd never guess they have vegan cheese and \"beef.\" Their jicama chili cheese fries were amazing and so was the vegan taco. Delicious food and no guilt!"}
{"text":"We have been planning on eating here for several weeks while on vacation!  I love the location and the tacos Were spot on!  Lots of good food options for vegans to those trying to eat a plant based diet!  If I had a complaint, is that staff seemed reluctant to engage in their customers! The success of a place of business is one part product and 2 parts service!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. I had their Fettucchini Alfredo and it was delicious. Would love to see them in Henderson!"}
{"text":"4 weeks ago we started a plant based lifestyle. Because it is very new to us we have been hesitant to dine out. When researching vegan restruants this came up on Yelp. We Decided to try it out and were not disappointed. We had the Asian tacos and green chili enchiladas. Both meals were nice sized portions and very yummy. The container park staff should keep the patio tables clean or customers need to clean up after themselves"}
{"text":"I tried Simply Pure for the first time and it did not disappoint. I had the Pasta (zucchini) with cashew Alfredo and marinated mushrooms.  It was very flavorful and satisfying.  It was at least 110 degrees today and this dish cooled me down and filled me up. The portion was large."}
{"text":"I am not a Vegan by any stretch of the word, but if all vegan food tastes this good I will definitely consider it.  My go to dish at Simply Pure is the Nachos.  I have tried both the TVP and chicken versions and they are both fantastic.  The flavors are very will developed surprisingly with no meat, cheese or sour cream.  I am not sure how they pull this off but these Nachos are really tasty.    Cost wise the items seem a slightly high for what you are getting but the portions are decent and you definitely will not be hungry afterward.  I always share this dish and neither of us are hungry after the fact.  When I look at it from that perspective there might be some value here.  For two people to eat for $12 in Las Vegas, that is not a bad deal after all.   Check out Simply pure on the Second Floor of the Container Park if you are looking for something different and want to give Vegan Cuisine a try."}
{"text":"Vegan lasagna with salad was super good. Took 15 min to get it out but it was worth the wait (they gave me a heads up on the wait time, so it was all good). Very filling and good, large portion, could be split, maybe get something else to go with it. I was full after eating 2/3 of it and over full after finishing it. I'll be back to try more vegan yummys!"}
{"text":"I saw the menu and knew I was going to have an amazing adventure and I was not let down.  The tacos were incredible and shared several salads.  The lasagna wa to die for.  My new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Cute cafe. Small eating area but very nice place. Food was a little too salty but presentation was beautiful. Good portions."}
{"text":"It was delicious! Very filling! We had the sampler platter #1. It was piled high with food! The zoodles were great, loved the pesto but didn't love the white sauce. The nachos were delicious and the cashew cheese made them extremely filling. The chicken taco has good flavor, but be warned it is more mushy than one might expect. I'd come again!"}
{"text":"Food and service were both amazing. The gentleman behind the counter made sure everything was perfect for us and couldn't have been friendlier. Perfect for vegans, or anyone who wants to see how good vegan food can really be. Will definitely come back many times."}
{"text":"I ordered through UberEats.   I just want to point out that this restaurant creats vegan raw foods so when it comes to wanting hot food or food packed full of flavor,  look elsewhere.  This isn't a bad thing but if it isn't what you want or was expecting,  it's probably because it's a raw vegan restaurant.  To start off I ordered the pesto tomatoe flat bread with lime chips and a half an order of fake beef nachos,  along with two juices.  The flat bread tasted alright but honestly made me nauseas a few bites in (I ate it all regardless because I was hungry). I eat vegetarian and been eating vast amounts of fruits and vegetables, mainly raw, so I know it wasn't because of not being used to healthy foods.  I dont know what kind of imitation cheese they put on it but it just didn't sit well with me. And I just felt the flavor wasn't very balanced;  In my opinion I feel it needed more pesto to balance out the intense flavor of the vegan cheese. I just didn't think it was worth the money when I've eating at pretty much every veg place in town and have had similar flat bread meal that was more flavorful and balanced for the same price. It needs improving.  The nachos I tasted however were decent for non-hot food but the imitation beef was EXCELLENT.    The con I have is when my ubereats driver pulled up they were struggling to keep our drinks upright as the restaurant never put them in drink holders. They were literally packed into a flimsy box that was falling apart at their weight and I could tell the driver was pissed because she had to hold it with one hand and drive with the other so they wouldn't completely collapse and explode in her car!  When I called the shop immediately after I got my order around 4:10pm and I wanted to speak to a manager about it the woman on the phone said they were outside interviewing but would call me back.  They never called me back,  lol.  And when the woman on the phone asked me what I was complaining about I was brief with her and she just explains that they used to never have drink holders.  And now they just used flimsy boxes that aren't drink holders AS drink holders. Huh? If McDonald's can afford cup holders and these other vegan restaurants have them,  why doesn't this place have them? Furthermore the drinks were warm so imagine drinking raw vegetables or fruit juice WARM.  Gross! I hope they get a good laugh outta this and then actually get some drink holders so paying customers and your uber drivers won't have to worry again about drinks spilling in their $100k cars! Plus both drinks were $12 that was at risk going down the drain and I don't appreciate playing with my money like that.    Overall I won't be back because honestly what I ate I could make at home that tastes better for the fraction of the cost. I feel they need to improve on their flavor, taste what others are doing around town and then go from there. Because if crave vegan food there are better tasting food,  even though not strictly raw,  elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great lunch at this totally vegan cafe. We saw reviews and photos on IG. Decided that our next visit to Vegas we would try it. This a petite cafe about 5 tables inside with 2 chairs to a table. There's seating available outside the cafe as well. Hubby and I entered and ordered the Thai Spring rolls, lettuce chicken wraps and a panini both with corn chips. Our food was tasteful and filling."}
{"text":"I was looking for a refreshing, healthy beverage, as I was getting sick of beer and fried foods during my trip to Vegas. This place was a breath of fresh air. Located in Container Park, this place caught my eye right away. I tried the TLC juice- lemon, lime, mint, cucumber and apple. It was super tasty and hit the spot. The food here looked wonderful as well, and I would have liked to have tried it if I had been hungry. The inside was quite small, only two little tables, but the walls were painted beautifully and it wouldn't be terrible to eat inside if you had a very small party."}
{"text":"Soooo I'm not totally. Vegan my trainer is a vegan and always tells me to give it a try and I don't see why not   I had been here before and what I ordered didn't really vibe with me but that's ok can't like everything....   Today I ordered the lasagna and it's was DELICIOUS honestly if I didn't know it was vegan I WOULDVE NEVER KNOWN !!!! The portions are big so I'll give some to my friend to try I want to see if he knows it's vegan   I will come back again to explore more of the menu"}
{"text":"Small shop churning out fantastic vegan food in big portions and a good vegan community feeling.  Even on off days it seems to be full of vegan diners!"}
{"text":"Reviewing this restarant is really hard, especially for a non-vegan/vegetarian. Ill start by saying that. I am rating my own experience, hopefully you'll have a better one.  The restaurant is in container park, which always means a cool atmosphere. I ordered sampler #2. Unfortunately i waited about 40 minutes for my food. And that's especialy surprising since ALL FOOD IS SERVED COLD. My food sure didnt seem like it took 40 min of preperation. The guy next to me ordered nachos and he said it took them 50 min to get his food. I was surprised the employee at the counter didnt even warn me that it would be a long wait - i was hungry and would have gone elsewhere.  As far as the food is concerned, i wasnt that impressed. Sampler #2 comes with a taco, fries, and a spring roll with kale chips on the side. The taco was a slice of avocado and sprinkles of fake meat in a lettuce leaf. That was ok but would have been much better served warm. Cold is just so unsatisfying. The fries were jicama maybe? They were sliced like fries and covered in fake meat and a creamy sauce that was decent. They were very crunchy which was kind of nice. Would have been better hot. The spring roll was the laziest food i have ever seen. It was one of those sticky rice paper rolls holding lettuce together. Thats it. The guy at the counter told me they had run out of a noodle that was supposed to go inside it too...surprised they still made it for me. Kale chips were on the side - ive never had kale chips before but the seasoning was so heavy i could barely eat them. I dont think thats how they are supposed to be....i ended up throwing out almost my entire meal. Very disappointing after that 40 min wait for my food! And $16 for this sampler was a bit overkill too...  They have some fresh juices that look good - may try this place again for juice but i have no intention of buying food here again. If youre a vegan though, you may enjoy the creative transformation of these veggies."}
{"text":"Hired Chef Stacey to cater our wedding and we were beyond thrilled with the turn out! It was 100% vegan and gluten free. She was fabulous to work with, listened to what we wanted and executed it beautifully. Her pricing was better than others who would cater vegan that we priced, we were very pleased with it. I was surprised thinking that she would be more pricey than she was. she doesn't automatically add in tip on either. So if you are thinking of having an event catered vegan, she's your lady!!! She will make a menu fit for you, doesn't just have a set list of items she makes that you pick from.   READ ON FOR DETAILS: The presentation of the serve yourself food was very pretty and all of our guests loved loved loved the food!! Basically every plate was cleaned, surprising to some people who were concerned about having all vegan GF food.   We had enchiladas, Thai (fresh) spring rolls with dip, some roasted battered cauliflower thing, a large fruit platter with papaya, mango, strawberries, blueberries, pineapple and cherries (our choosing), chips and salsa, a taco bar with; corn tortillas, Spanish brown rice, black beans, fajita vegetables, guacamole, pico, green salsa, mango salsa, chipotle aioli, cashew nacho cheese, roasted garlic cloves, shredded cabbage & romaine lettuce.   The meat eaters of the group were IN LOVE with the enchiladas and we kept getting told how amazing they were. At the end of the night there weren't any left and people were asking for more.  No one could believe how amazing all of it tasted, this was before they found out ALL of it was vegan&GF. They knew it would be mostly vegan but figured some might not be. The only soy product was TVP in the enchiladas.   I knew people would be happy with the food when we did a tasting with Stacey (visiting from out of state) but the resounding feedback saying \"soooo good\" was a bit more than I even expected, since many of our non vegan guests weren't too into \"healthy\" eating.  Thank you Chef Stacey!!!"}
{"text":"Super good cafe! It is in a small container inside the container park near the entrance and a limited amount of indoor and outdoor seating. Had the sampler #1 and it all tasted fresh and pleasant. I recommend the sampler if you're not sure what to get, they have different sample options as well. The lady working on the Monday my boyfriend and I stopped in was sweet and asked about our preferences in cashew or soy cheese on our nachos, I opted for soy and it was great, definitely my favorite item on the platter. We also tried the strawberry cheesecake and it was so creamy I was pleasantly surprised. I will be trying this place again soon."}
{"text":"Another Vegan dream located in the heart of downtown Las Vegas, in container park...for such a small location the menu is huge for food and drinks...\"damn I love being Vegan\"...This place was so good I had the Nacho Supreme and it was so \"FIRE\" aka damn delicious as a MOFO,it is a must go there more then once type of   Vegan eatery.The question is...would I go there again??? You see the 5 stars and that is an \"Absolutely\"!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Zucchini Pasta with Cashew Alfredo sauce ($11.95) topped with mushrooms & spinach. It was delicious. You get one choice of topping. I recommend the mushrooms because they add a nice savory meaty texture & they are nicely flavored with seasonings. I tried a sample of both the key lime mousse & the chocolate ganache. Both were good & tasty. Derek, the cashier was really nice, friendly & helpful. He's a warm hearted guy, who makes you feel welcomed. It's a small, super casual take-out cafe but there is plenty of outdoor seating all around the shopping plaza which is called the Outdoor Container Park. They are located upstairs. I ended ordering the Key Lime Mousse for dessert. Derek gave me granola to use as a topping which made it even better. Prices are reasonable for Vegan food."}
{"text":"I had a really great time this morning at Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan.  Had the HIGH OCTANE juice full of Beets, Carrots, Cucumber, and Ginger.  It was wonderfully energizing and full of healthy ingredients. I also had Mock Chikin Salad Lettuce Wraps: mock chikin made with almonds and cashews, sprouts, diced tomatoes, and a cashew cream sauce wrapped in lettuce leaves (served with a side of tortilla chips) $11.95.  This was full of favor surprises and packed a lot of heartiness and satisfaction. While I do not always eat as healthy as I should, I KNOW that when Chef Stacey places her considerable talents and reputation behind her offerings, she is committed to offering the very BEST.  The best ingredients, the best preparation, the best balanced nutrition.   She is not only fulfilling her dream to serve the community and to educate our palates and understanding of how to revitalize our lives via the choices that we make to fuel our bodies.  She simply cares! And she deliberately made time to ask for my feedback and my input toward helping her to help our community make better eating choices. She is a true Las Vegas treasure and she really deserves our community support.   This is not just a business, it is an educational resource, and a center for experimentation in treating ourselves better.  Check out Chef Stacey's story at https://www.facebook.com/SimplyPureLV and you readily will see that she has a vision to serve our community as she builds her business. Here is just a little of what she has posted on her Facebook site: \"Exactly 1 year ago today I quit my job at Wynn Resorts and stepped out on faith to pursue a life of full time freedom and entrepreneurship. Less than one year later, I fulfilled my dream of opening my own vegan restaurant. 1 year ago i was full of anxiety, fear, hope and faith. Today I am filled with abundant love, extreme gratitude, hope restored and faith realized. I am happy. I am free. I thank GOD for allowing me to experience life. My only prayer is that I remain a conduit through which He works and that I teach others to truly live their passion. #SimplyPure #ChefStaceyDougan #January4th #DreamFulfilled #TeamFreedom\" Q.E.D.  Chef Stacey Dougan walks the walk that she writes about."}
{"text":"My husband and I made a stop here while on vacation. We loved Container Park - what a vibrant and innovative experience! I had the pesto grilled cheese with a side of lime tortilla chips. The panini was great - the cheese had a great texture and the pesto was fantastic. The chips were a bit stale tasting and I could not detect the lime. My husband had the lasagna and he absolutely loved it. They actually heat it in an oven as opposed to microwave and the extra time that took was worth it. The portion was large and the flavors bold and fresh. He ate every bite. If I lived here this would be a great \"to go\" restaurant. There really isn't a lot of seating and the venue is very small. We sat outside and that was great for October, but wouldn't want to do that in August! Hopefully, this business will do well and they can open a full size, dine-in restaurant. Well done!"}
{"text":"We eat here very often and enjoy the food. With my many years in the food industry I have never denied a customer a retuned item.  I'm very upset that after ordering the wrong $12 item I was denied my request for a discount on another item. I understand it was my fault but I absolutely don't understand why you would make someone keep an item they HATE. I wasted my money here on the \"RAW FRIES\" and I guess only people that complain and act ruthless get what they want. I didn't even want it free, just some help with the price. I even tip the staff every time. I won't be back for a while. I have a very bad taste in my mouth with this restaurant now."}
{"text":"It's worth it every time I drive across town to eat here. Everything I've eaten, I've loved. My fave is the lasagna but the spring rolls, tacos, sandwiches, all consistently satisfying. My non-vegan teen loves the fresh juices and nachos, of course.  The cheesecakes are a must and I toggle between them becauseI love them all equally. I swear, I can never order just one item! The refrigerated drink selection is also fantastic. Friendly staff, every single time. Tho there are coupons and rewards cards, I've never wanted to use them because I want her to make as much money as she can. I'm so glad Simply Vegan came to town!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad was so excited. The flavor on this was not appetizing at all. I'm sorry. The bread has a funny flavor. I don't know I tried to eat it. Going in the trash. I'm very disappointed as this was supposed to be my lunch. I think I missed something on how this is supposed to taste.  Also why bother adding chips. If it's a sample. Thank god they were there as now they were my lunch."}
{"text":"I just died with happiness with her nachos and the TLC fruit drink is the most amazing drink in Vegas has the perfect blend and bursting with flavors all I can say if you haven't tried it you need to hands down im not vegan but I'm goi ng back for more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the coconut kale salad and OMG!!!! So good!!! The people were really friendly and helpful with suggestions and questions. I really like kale salads but I think this is the best kale salad I have ever had. The flavor of the dressing was ON POINT!!!!"}
{"text":"Blown away. I thought we had good vegan food in San Diego but wow I am still thinking of this place a full month after my last visit. The kale salad was mind-boggling, simple yet incredibly delicious. We got the sampler platter #3 and it was an insane amount of food, but everything was so good that I had to eat it. I had slight regret from being very full after, but otherwise I would do it all over again. Way to go Chef Stacey!"}
{"text":"Lovr love love the food, location, and ambiance!! And its black owned! Yassss!!! Thumbs up"}
{"text":"So so so fabulous and perfect for a hot Summer day. In town for work, I dread eating out because it's such a hassle. I generally end up stocking up for the week at Trader Joe's with salads but I really want better vegan food. Searching on Yelp, I found that getting to this place inside of Container Park was pretty easy from the Convention Center area and also from World Market, both locations I have to go to this week. I have a feeling I will be trying to hit them up a few times this week. I got the zucchini \"pasta\" with basil marinara and extra tomatoes. It was so fresh and so, so good. Great flavors, and it was cold which was awesome for this 105 degree day. The serving size was HUGE which was so nice. Sometimes you go to a vegan restaurant and leave wanting to scream \"I'm vegan! Not anorexic!\" And go on the hunt for your next meal. Not here. You'll be satisfied for sure. I think it was Chef Stacey working now that I see the photos online. She was very nice and glows from the inside out. Likely from those fresh foods. :)"}
{"text":"We came in on a Tuesday night, it was a beautiful evening outside and we wanted something quick and healthy. Neither of us had ever tried simply pure before... So we were both pretty excited to try a new all vegan and raw spot.        We walked into the tiny little container and we were greeted by a gentleman who seemed a little over the day at that point. Never the less... He proceeded to give a run down of how everything worked and even let us taste a few salad bar items before we ordered. The couscous was pretty darn good so I will be back for that.        We opted for the pesto zucchini pasta with sun dried tomatoes and the spring rolls to share. The prices and portions are comparable to places like sun cafe in LA and GO RAW around town. They may seem high... But they Are definitely enough to feed two people comfortably. The bill rang in at right around 20 bucks before tip. Basically... Ten dollars a person and we both left feeling full and satisfied. Order smart and you won't be breaking the bank and remember it's raw... You fill up a little quicker.        The pesto... Probably one of the best vegan pestos I've ever eaten... It was thick and creamy and delicious. Vegenation could use some insight and schooling from chef Stacey on what a good vegan pesto should taste like. The portion was large enough for both of us. My only regret is that we didn't put more toppings on it!! The sun dried tomatoes were a perfect touch and the texture was wonderful. The spring rolls Were fat thick pieces of heaven. They were perfectly crunchy on the inside and served with a nice sweet and sour sauce. We loved both items equally:) and finished the entire meal.        This is a perfect edition to the downtown area... And for somewhere like container park... It's an ideal concept. We can't wait to go back and order more of the delicious food and platters we saw... And next time we will make sure to save some room for dessert. Thank you chef Stacey for creating such a fun and delicious spot in one of our favorite areas of town!"}
{"text":"Was happy to find this Vegan restaurant while visiting Las Vegas.   We tried the nachos, lasagne and pesto and tomato grilled cheese. All were delicious and our meat eating family could not tell the difference.   I would highly recommend coming here if you want amazing food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I wish stacey dougan could be my live in chef. life would be perfect!!! This place is better and better everytime i visit! !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing chef and fabulous salad bar just wasn't a fan of the jicama chili cheese fries...would try something else tho!"}
{"text":"Loved this place - it's tiny and nestled in the container district so  enjoy the day and spend an hour walking around. The nachos were excellent and the staff very friendly."}
{"text":"If you're a Vegan/Vegetarian visiting the LV area, Simply Pure is located in the new shipping container park near Fremont St. This is a great spot to eat if you have other meat-eaters with you as there are other restaurant options as well. I had the Vegan Nachos and added cashew cheese, it was so surprisingly hearty and flavorful! 10x better than your typical veggie crumbles. I ordered the small Nachos and that filled me up pretty well."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and fabulous! I'm pretty new to vegan dining, but the food tastes amazing! The people working here are super friendly, helping us make choices! We would definitely come back again and again! My husband had the green chili enchiladas  and I had the raw angel hair zucchini pasta with sun dried tomato and basil marinara. They were both excellent choices and very flavorful."}
{"text":"jumped in for a quick snack and to see what Vegas has to offer on the vegan side. Very friendly service. Awesome spring rolls....had to get cash from ATM because they don't take AMEX. But they do accept other cards. Gotta try something else to get the full experience. But it's located in Container Park so mostly a grab and GO situation."}
{"text":"This is amazing food! Everything is obviously fresh! The taste is going to blow your mind!  Because its vegan you can eat a lot and you don't feel heavy afterwards ."}
{"text":"I ordered sample platter #1.  Nachos grande were the best I have ever had.  Zuchine pasta and lettuce wrap were just okay."}
{"text":"The vegan nachos.....Hands down best vegan dish I've ever had. For all my fellow vegans out there trying to prove to people  vegan food can be SO DAMN GOOD, Simply Pure is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. As a my life style recently changed to a vegetarian lifestyle, this place was up my alley. The place is small but most people should know that if you know anything about container park. I met Stacey I believe who was awesome. Really explained her menu to me and what she uses to cook with. Plus I was wondering how they got their protein. All questions answered. I ended up getting the \"beef\" Asian tacos. Vegan Protein \"Beef\" Avocado, Cabbage, Vermicelli Noodles, Sesame Seeds, Sweet Chili Sauce on corn tortillas and Kettle Chips. Mouth watering I swear. I walked all the way home with the tacos and they were still fresh and not soggy. The \" beef\" was the best part. I will defiantly be back for sure. This place is too close and good not too. Great service and food there. Everything is fresh and made on the spot there. I even called them when I got home to tell them how amazing it was. I was literally licking my fingers!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! My hubby and I got the ultimate sampler because we both wanted to try everything. I guarantee you will not be disappointed because everything is full of flavor! I will be back again :)."}
{"text":"Talk about a FIND!!! Everyone raves about the nachos - I say try the spring rolls. They are some of the biggest spring rolls I've ever had and they are delicious. The owner, Stacey, is hugger and a smiler. I'll be coming back for the food and the people."}
{"text":"The service wasn't very good. I've gone here before and the service was fantastic, but this time I did not feel welcomed. The nachos and lasagna were delicious. Cheesecake was expensive and kind of small but good taste. The Asian tacos were inedible, i had to through them out. The meat was plain tasting and a glob of hot sauce. I did not enjoy them at all. My stomach hurt after eating a bite of the tacos. Also they took a long time to make them even thou I ordered for pickup."}
{"text":"This cozy little restaurant definitely serves up some tasty food. I had the nachos grande and the ultimate sampler, which allowed me try a variety of their menu items.   The full order of nachos was quite a generous amount, I was not able to finish it in one sitting. I was so happy that their cheese actually resembled the flavor of nacho cheese. I've had some pretty bad replicas but theirs was spot on. The nachos were topped with a few slices of avocado but they were mostly consisted of cheese and vegan ground beef. I wish they added more pico de gallo to lighten it up and add some acidity. I feel like guacamole also would've been a better choice for nachos than avocado slices and I missed the sour cream. Aside from that, I did enjoy them.  The jicama chili cheese fries are basically the exact same thing as the nachos except they use jicama. I loved their pesto zucchini pasta! It was fresh, light and flavorful. Definitely something I would order again. Everything I had on the sampler platter was good. Overall, I had a positive dining experience"}
{"text":"Not the best but not the worst. Sadly, vegan food is just more expensive. My main complaint is the price. Menu states that the sampler 1 is $13 but I paid $16. (I assumed this was the added tax and bottled water so no biggy.) But then after I paid I saw on yelp you can get 10% off for checking in. I asked if I could still get the discount even though I just paid, she said yes but would have to start over again. After checking out I realized I was still charged $16, even with the 10% discount so it was useless. Lol"}
{"text":"The sample platter was fantastic. The lasagna is unbelievable and the cheese cake 5 stars all by itself. A cool container park with a few tables but several outside. The little bit of a wait on this enjoyable day is more than expected from delicious hand crafted Plant Based food!  We could not have enjoyed it more nor could we have been happier with location or friendliness. Thanks to Stacey for providing a great overall experience!!"}
{"text":"This food is UHHH-MAZE-ING. The staff is super friendly and inviting. Definitely coming back for the nachos and lasagna again!"}
{"text":"I do love this place.  My favorite is the Nachos Grande.  Taste like real Nachos!  This is my go to order when I decide to have this place for lunch at the last minute.  The last several times I've gotten it, it was perfect.  I'm not sure if it was me this last go around, but the \"beef\" to me tasted a tad bit on the salty side.  But it's still my favorite.  This go around, I also tried the Decadent Chocolate Cheesecake.  Love it.  Although to some non-vegan eaters, they would frown upon the thought of having a vegan cheesecake.  I got the \"eww\" text message when I sent a picture to my guy.  You have to have an open mind to enjoy vegan desserts.  Off topic, I tried a vegan muffin at another place and I didn't care for that, which made me hesitant to try any \"vegan\" desserts, but the cheesecakes here at Simply Pure is awesome to my likings.   In the past I've also tried the Mama Mia Lasagna.  I ordered it to go.  While it was tasteful and good, I thought they overloaded my container with the \"sauce\".  My lasagna was drowning in it.  If I did order it again, I'd ask if they could hold off on the sauce.    In the past I've also tried their Sampler #1 that came with Zucchini Pasta Trio, Nacho Grande, and the Chicken Salad Lettuce Wrap.  I enjoyed everything except for the Chicken Salad Lettuce Wrap.  I wasn't feeling the flavor or texture of it.   Last, I've tried the Thai Basil Spring Rolls.  I wasn't a big fan of these.  To me, the vermicelli noodles were on the hard side.    As far as service goes, all I can say is EH.  It's hit or miss for me when I go.  The workers there are friendly but as far as calling in orders or just calling in general, sometimes I get no answer especially when I'm trying to place a pick up order.  This last go around, I came in and there were three guys in front of me.  I'm not sure what the holdup was, but the gal at the register was taking FOR-EV-ER on one guy who sounded like he ordered one thing.      So with all that being said, I'll always be back!  Happy Eatings!"}
{"text":"Sampler #1 was delicious! I loved everything in it. The nachos had the cashew sauce upgrade for $1, and it was sooo worth it. Definitely quenched my comfort food craving.    The young ladies working were very pleasant. I also noticed that they were really patient and nice to one of the customers who ordered after me who had a lot of questions.    Thanks for the great experience. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Before going you should know a couple of things. The business is located on the 2nd story at the container park. When you enter the door you'll see that there is only room enough for about four adults to stand at the counter to give their order. You will have to scout out a table on your own. These are scattered along the narrow walk way and clustered in a couple areas outside in public spaces not directly connected with this business. Depending on the time of day you may be stuck sitting in the sun. Additionally you will need to bus your own table.  I thought the prices were high. Our lunch for 2 came in at just under $50. That included 2 juices, 2  vegan wraps and one kale snack. On a personal note I will say it was some of the worst tasting food I've ever tried. Healthy food need not be awful. The physical arrangements are quite informal. It is really more like a stationary food truck. We went on Memorial Day when the weather was still very nice. The best part of our time there was enjoying the nice breeze. I know this review is negative. I don't write these unless we really had an unpleasant time. Maybe we should have taken the food back and asked for a refund? Maybe we would have had a better out come."}
{"text":"Ok so here is my review, unfortunately it is only 2 stars. My cousin is a vegan so we have been trying out different vegan places to eat and we were excited to try this one. A coworker loves this place and said they had the best lasagna. So we decided to try it. First off it is located at Container Park which is fine but when you go inside it is extremely small, there are places to sit down and eat directly outside of the business. Inside seating is limited to 8 to 10 people, 2 seats per table. The atmosphere was ok the customer service was average. The best thing on the menu was the nachos and jicama fries. Everything was cold nothing was hot or cooked. Expected more will not be returning unless it is for take out and only for the nachos or jicama fries."}
{"text":"Being a vegan in Vegas has been much more enjoyable thanks to Chef Stacey. Simply pure is on my top 3 list of restaurants. The vegan food is flavorful.  I work at a burger restaurant and I always recommend people to try Simply Pure because their taste buds will be blown away. Try the nachos with cashew cheese.   Chef Stacey also can cater events. Her catering menu contains some different choices. I tried the macaroni and cheese from her catering menu for Thanksgiving. Dear God that shxt was dangerous!!   Thank you Chef Stacey!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place. The nachos were out of this world. Completely vegan. The best nachos ever. Service was great also."}
{"text":"Tbh I ate here a few times but besides the lasagna and the sampler I wouldn't get anything else. Common chef, u didn't prep my plate but I got a BLT for the first and last time because of how disappointing it looks (which I'll add in the pics) other than that ,that's all my advice. For ~9 bucks it wasn't worth it for that. But like I said , do get the lasagna . Oh and I got a cheesecake once also... it was VERY disappointing. Just order one and you'll know what I mean. It was like a sliced up Diaya cheesecake. So small words can't describe it. Thanks for reading my review I hope the owner sees this as well"}
{"text":"We traveled 7 hours to try Stacey's lasagna and let me tell you it did not disappoint! We also had the green chili enchiladas, Nacho's and jicima raw chili cheese fries (my favorite and so creative)! I wish she was closer to me her food is so full of flavor and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So good vegan food. A great raw experience for the newbies interested in raw food. We got the biggest platter with 3  zucchini pasta, raw jicama fries with raw nut meat and raw cheese, and raw tacos. Very nice deft try the complete player with all entrees/sides."}
{"text":"Nice small spot in Container Park. Food is excellent! You will have to wait a bit, but your food is fresh and cooked right then! Staff are friendly and helpful if you are new to eating Vegan. Don't be afraid to try it!"}
{"text":"Delicious raw vegan food!  My boyfriend and I made our first stop in LV here and were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful service and the fresh, delicious, and healthy food.   I got the zucchini spaghetti with mushrooms. So fresh and filling! I'm amazed at how they made the flavors shine.  My boyfriend got the chicken tacos-yum!!  Even if you're not a raw foodist or a vegan, I recommend this place for the healthy, fresh, and flavorful food.  Besides the wonderful food, the service was above and beyond most restaurants.  Our waitor was enthusiastic, friendly, and eager to help us with any questions we may have had.  He really made us feel comfortable and at home.  Even better was when he had us try their avocado coconut ganache.  It blew my socks off!!  Kudos for their great service and great food.  I can't wait to come back the next time im in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. I recently got the lasagna and it had so much flavor. The service is always good and they are more than happy to answer any questions. This is a place where vegans and nonvegans can enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Not from Vegas so I just came in because I looked up vegan restaurants on yelp. Came in to excellent service and pretty smiles. All the girls in here were super nice and super cute! Complete vegan place I felt like I was in heaven. Coming back to this place for a 2nd time tomorrow. Glad I gave my business to this company. Must go for any vegans or even meat eaters that want a deliciously cook meal.   *5 star*"}
{"text":"Simply Pure is simply wonderful!  Try the Thai Basil Spring Rolls and thank me later."}
{"text":"Simply pure is a unique spot inside of the container park. The food is always fresh, but the prices are arguably high. I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and was very pleased with the flavors.  If you're planning on eating there I recommend sitting out front and enjoying the views and vibes of the downtown experience."}
{"text":"The food here is so amazing . Like the likelihood of having healthy chilli cheese fries is low unless your eating hear lol"}
{"text":"Great customer service, & fantastic food! The staff was very knowledgeable, & helpful. I had the raw angel hair zucchini pasta w/ sun-dried tomato & basil marinara topped w/ diced tomato. Of course this dish was vegan, but it was also oil free! The marinara sauce does contain agave nectar, which I would prefer it didn't, but it was still a nice treat."}
{"text":"We loved the food so much we went two days in a row! I can't recommend the lasagne enough.... absolutely flavorful and cooked to perfection! We recently went Vegan and were concerned about missing out on some of our favorite dishes. We don't need to worry anymore!!!  Wonderful food, wonderful service, wonderful location!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavors!!  Nachos are very refreshing and a good amount.  All salad bar items are well rounded in flavor and you can sample all of them for free!!!"}
{"text":"It was a little tricky to find this place and the street parking was a bit of a chore but this place was worth it. We did take out which is good because the restaurant is really small. We had the TLT which was really good. This is my daughter's favorite sandwich and this was one of the best she's had. The coconut kale salad was super delicious! This place is a gem."}
{"text":"My friend came over with some vegan nachos from Simply Pure one day & it was so good that I kept craving it. So we finally go to meet up there & the girl at the register was a sweetheart. I wanted to try other things but the portions were too much.   I got the nachos with cashew cheese & tacos. They both were big portions  & had similar taste but we enjoyed it. My friend got the lasagna & a pressed juice & let me try it. It was delicious! Everything was good & there was a good vibe.  The space was a little tight in there & I had a double stroller so I had to leave it in the outside seating area. It would be too cramped for me, my 4 kids & friend to be eating in there so we just found s nice place outside by the play area. We'll be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing food and juice.   I purchased the large sampler plate and am so happy I did.  I was able to try a little of everything and none of it disappointed. The fresh juice was also on point and complimented the meal.  Excellent food & fast service."}
{"text":"Smoked tempeh \"Grilled TLT\" was out of this world. So good I had to come back for a second one!  Friendly staff, nice place."}
{"text":"Mind blowing, mouth watering vegan food!!!! (Even my omnivore boyfriend LOVED it!) FANTASTIC! You must order the zucchini noodle Alfredo \"pasta\" & the nachos! To die for! I would come all the back back to Vegas just for her amazing food. Seriously, I'm planning another trip in November!"}
{"text":"Very original vegan food served by friendly staff! Very small inside though, with only 3 small tables but there are a few outdoor tables."}
{"text":"We got Sampler #1 zucchini pasta trio, nachos and lettuce wrap which was excellent.  We have a 4 minute video to post but can only load 10 seconds. We'd love to post the full review."}
{"text":"This is a very small place. The food is good, but the kitchen is small so expect to wait a bit for your food. It's nice to have a vegan option in the downtown Vegas area, but I wish the service was a bit friendlier."}
{"text":"Juice took 20 minutes, staff was cold, no sense of customer service, juice tasted watered down. There are better juice places, don't waste your money at this one."}
{"text":"Vegan places in Las Vegas can be so hard to find. I've gotten used to just going somewhere with my friends and getting a basic salad or sandwich with no \"umph\" to them. I had seen some reviews of Simply Pure and saw pictures of the delicious looking nachos but didn't know if I wanted to fork out the money for premium vegan food.  I am pretty dang glad I did. In the future, I will get the amazing nachos every time... Maybe venture to the zucchini pasta. I got the ultimate sampler plate that comes with 1 raw vegan taco, 1 raw vegan chicken salad wrap, a serving of nachos, a serving of jicama chili fries, and 3 different samples of the zucchini pasta.   The zucchini pasta came with 3 different sauces: a pesto, a creamy cashew sauce (with incredible seasonings on top!), and a marinara. I would defieget the pesto or cashew sauce again but I wasn't insanely thrilled with the marinara. It was good but I wouldn't eat a whole plate of it.  The chicken salad was made from tofu that day and was pretty tastey. The texture isn't the same as real chicken but the flavor was there. The taco was nommy and had the same \"ground beef\" that's on the nachos and fries. I could eat about 3 of them and be pleasantly full.  ^_^  The nachos, like I've said before and I'll say it again, were amazingggg. The cashew cream and fake beef was delightful :D  I wasn't the biggest fan of the jicama fries. It was a raw dish so the fries were crispy. They had good flavor but I didn't like the crunchiness of the raw fries.  Overall, I would definitely come back! Do expect about a 15 minute wait if you order the sampler. I understand that it does take a while to create such a variety of food. I was very happy with my meal!!"}
{"text":"great amazing raw food, limited selection and a little pricey"}
{"text":"This place is located down town in the container park. It's really small and clean. Smells amazing when you walk in. The menu is 100% vegan and 110% delicious! The mama Mia lasagna is a must try! This was my first visit here but definitely not my last."}
{"text":"The best thing going for the Container Park.  I was stalking Stacey Dougan's Instagram pics of her food, and I couldn't wait to try this place.  Located on the second floor near the entrance of Container Park is where you will find Simply Pure. I was greeted immediately by Derrick, who was very informative about their food. They have a raw vegan salad bar that is $10.99/lb and I was able to sample a couple different items, the Kale Salad was my personal favorite. I couldn't decide between the Jicama Chili Cheese Fries or the Nachos, but decided on later since I'd been eyeballing them for awhile. Portion was pretty big, I could only eat half of my order.  I was also treated to a sample of the dark chocolate ganache with almond granola for dessert. This was really good!  They also offer fresh pressed organic juices.  I really like this place, I like that everyone was passionate about the food and very friendly and knowledgable."}
{"text":"Was sent there to try the vegan chili fries, but the staff suggested their \"famous\" vegan nachos instead.  Looked like classic nachos until I reached out for a bite... ice cold!  Didn't even realize it was a \"raw\" vegan place, which I usually avoid.  We could barely finish the nachos between the two of us.  Totally unique and in a great setting in the Container Park, just a short walk from Fremont Street."}
{"text":"Wow. The lasagna was 5*! The flavor was outstanding. What a gem. Happened to be walking by and we decided to try something new. Yum. Don't let the location in Container Park deter you. While there's minimal room inside, there is usually ample seating outside. It's casual. The quality of the food, intensity of flavor and healthy options will draw us back, and we'll be bringing family next time."}
{"text":"Just like last time, the food here did not disappoint.   I had the enchiladas, as they said the veggie lasagna would take around 20 minutes to prepare. This took a little over 10.  I understand it's not a fast food place. I just wish I'd had more time to wait to try their signature lasagna.  The enchiladas were delicious and plentiful. I'd say maybe there was too much faux ground meat - but it tasted great. And of course, way healthier as a soy/bean protein substitute rather than as real meat.  The dough of the \"tortillas\" was so thick that it reminded me of tamales. It was still amazing though.  However, the presentation wasn't great - but I guess there's only so much you can do with enchiladas. So I guess it's not really big deal!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the customer service and explaining what I was getting!! My first time trying and I love it!! Filling,tasteful,and healthy!!! I'm going to become a regular!!!"}
{"text":"The manager was VERY rude!! Someone in our party waited over 45 minutes for a meal. He ordered before all of us and we all finished our food before he even got his. He decided to ask for a refund and not take the food because we were running late. The manager was a total bitch and refused to compensate the meal, as any restaurant with good customer service would. The employee VERY nicely offered to give my friend her employee meal. The manager then was very rude to someone in my party who said the employee should not have to use their personal employee meal for a mistake made on the companies behalf. Will never be returning to this location, the manager needs to be fired and the employee needs a raise!"}
{"text":"Looking for a good variety of filling, fresh and flavorful food that is super healthy for you?  Look no more, Simply Pure is your place!   The menu has a lot of options and they even have a salad bar filled with even more choices.  I love the assortment of beverages and the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  Service was fast and delicious!  I will definitely  be back to try more dishes. Side note:  The kale chips are off the chain scrumptious...the most healthy addiction you could ask for!"}
{"text":"Previously they were only Raw and juice. Now they also have cooked vegan food.   Great food, friendly service, and very personable.  Feel good about supporting a local vegan business"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I've had everything multiple times and I live clear across the U.S.  It's always a must to stop here."}
{"text":"Very good vegan food. I had researched this location prior to arriving and was excited to visit. I was surprised that it is mostly a take out venue. The place is TINY and all dishes are served on cardboard plates with plastic utensils. (Not my favorite way of eating) Still - the food is beautifully presented with vibrant colors.   Unfortunately the flavors are not distinctive from one dish to the next. Meaning - you order a \"beef\" vs \"chicken\" and they taste almost the same.  It's almost as though - the filling is identical.  But - maybe if you are vegan - it works?  There was plenty of it and seemed an excellent value. Something that is not always true with vegan food. I would return and ask for a little more spice.  I find that most often - the guest needs to order correctly to be more satisfied with a meal."}
{"text":"I was so excited just by reading the reviews.  Unfortunately you did not deliver....  Got the basil  spring rolls and have absolutly no flavors,  couples tiny dice basil leave did not help. Then get the lasagna who looks good but was still very cold inside...  One of the layer of the pasta were bearly cook when the other ones were kind of aldente...maybe for the vegan  spring rolls you should check \"le pho\" down the street.. I gave 2 stars because the 2 staff member were extremely nice."}
{"text":"Simply Pure by Chef Stacey Dougan - Downtown Container Park  Nope, I'm not turning a new \"leaf\".  I'm not Vegan or a Vegetarian.  My daughter is and when I'm with her, I will eat a few meatless meals.  We originally attempted to eat at the other Vegan/Vegetarian spot around the corner, but the wait was way too long.  The Future Mrs. C. was with us and recommended that we give Simply Pure a shot.  My daughter got their grilled cheese and we shared the kale chips.  She loved the grilled cheese and still raves about it.  The kale chips are awesome, very low in calories, and surprisingly satiating.  Price for everything is about average to the rest of the Vegan/Vegetarian spots that I've been to.  I'm sure that I will be back when my daughter is in town."}
{"text":"First time here but had the food before. Love the healthy vegan options, I'm sure I'll be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian going vegan and I came here to visit my brother at Nellis AFB. Therefore, not being home, I was having a tough time finding a place to eat. Found this gem and let me tell you, DAMN. Amazing nachos, super great tacos, and really fresh spring rolls. (In a super cute place, too) so wish we had one of these in Grand Rapids, Michigan."}
{"text":"This place is ok. But the TVP \"beef\" wrecks the entire menu because it is low quality. It is rubbery and doesn't chew well at all (I spit it out). But humans will eat anything... even rubber... which is really sad.  For example, the Gardein beef at Vegenation is a much much better vegan meat. You could try the pizza there and experience this for yourself! Beef crumbles at The Modern Vegan are also better than the one's here.  I'd like to know what brand of beef crumble they are using because I'm pretty sure it is not the higher quality Gardein product.  Either improve the TVP or else have an option to substitute it with tofu.  Other thing I don't like is everything is premixed so if I want to get enchiladas with no onion, I can't do that.  On the plus side - cashew cheez here is the best vegan cheez in town! It's way more flavorful than other spots and the consistency is amazing.  Simply Pure has potential and obviously it is tough because they are in a cramped space.   I do appreciate the owner Stacy's thoughtful comment to my review so I really hope they can incorporate some more flexibility into the menu. But - I can't raise my rating to more than 2 stars because I just can't eat here. Oh well."}
{"text":"Did some research on Yelp before visiting Las Vegas and found a lot of people recommending this place! It is a pretty small place at the container park near downtown, so you may want to get take-outs if you want to enjoy your food more comfortably. My friend and I ordered the ultimate sampler plate with the zucchini spirals, nachos, jimaca fries, and 2 tacos. The food was filling but wasn't amazing either. The zucchini spirals were raw and watery, but I liked the cashew sauce a lot. The nachos were on the saltier side and the \"beef\" protein tasted like overcooked ground beef. I was actually looking forward to the jimaca fries beforehand, but it tasted pretty weird and I have to say I wasn't a fan. However, the staff there was very friendly and checked in on us every now and then. I would like to try the desserts and the lasagna next time I visit :)"}
{"text":"Great raw/vegan place in the Container Park. Stacey is super nice and helpful. We went on a weekday afternoon and she was surprisingly busy. It didn't help a photographer was stopping by to do some shots of her place. Needless to say she wasn't expecting it to be so busy. Along with her other helper, it took them a while to make our Ultimate Sampler. We were pretty patient but I'd peg it at around half an hour. That's my only knock. The food was fantastic! I especially liked the jicama fries and of course the nachos were great too. The zuccini pasta was tasty too. I'll go again and taste something else - everything on the menu looked tasty!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had their mamma Mia lasagna and was very impressed. Limited seating just an FYI. I had a great dining experience here."}
{"text":"Loved it! I had this place on my list to visit before I left and luckily I came across it before departing. The food was excellent, Chef Dougan is an awesome person, and I'll definitely be back there on my next trip.   I ordered zucchini pasta with spinach and mushrooms along with the cashew alfredo sauce. The dish was plentiful and delicious."}
{"text":"My 1st time to try Vegan and I am completely blown away with how delicious it was! Highly recommend everyone trying out this little taste of heaven!"}
{"text":"This place was great! I went here on Halloween night and got Sampler 1. It was HUGE, my friend and I each got our own but we could have totally shared it. I absolutely loved the flavor on everything. The only thing is how expensive it is-but you really do get what you pay for. I was able to have leftovers...yummy. I also had \"cheese\"cake and it was fantastic. Every person who was there held a great conversation and you can tell they are passionate about what they do! VEGAN HEAVEN right here...."}
{"text":"I don't 5 star anything very often.  I'm frugal with perfect ratings.  This place is mad healthy and pretty tasty.  The taste is similar to the stuff you enjoy with Staceys on little twist on it!  The nachos, tacos, noodles, jiccama, lasagna and spring rolls were well made.  Check out Chef Dougans restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if possible. Waited over an hour for my food, only to have the manager tell me to leave and be extremely rude to the kind employee who was trying to help me. The employee actually gave up her employee meal to refund me. The manager needs to go or I will not be returning...."}
{"text":"First, they seem to have moved locations recently (per their phone recording). There was no salad bar at the location we went to last night. I have to say that the menu (like the interior space) is small but memorable, filled with spectacular hits and misses for us. We did the four-meal Groupon special.   We weren't fans of any of their juice combinations, and we tried them all. They were heavy on some of the more unpleasant flavors (especially ginger and celery). We won't be getting those again. We also were not fans of the raw jicama \"fries\" (or any of the chili cheese fries dish) or the \"chicken\" lettuce wraps.  However, the lasagna and pesto grilled cheese were AMAZING. Even the little side salad that comes with them, which was just lettuce, had fantastic dressing. We'll definitely come back for more of these!   Bottom line: you might hate some of the dishes here, depending on your taste, but you might love others. So, give it a second chance if you don't like it the first time."}
{"text":"I've come to Vegas many times and wanted to opt for a healthier option during my first time at the Container Park. The food was average, BUT I WAITED 58 whole minutes for it (exact). That's right after driving down from Southern California, so I was not a very kind and starving human."}
{"text":"my 6yr old granddaughter has several food allergies and the best compromise for her to eat tasty food w/no risk is Vegan. Simply Pure is now her favorite, simply because this is where she had her first cheesecake and lasagna!! so glad she couldn't really read the menu because i'm sure i would be broke on our first visit!! online i showed her pics of the foods she can eat and introduced her to Stacey as the lady that makes your special food. although she was not on location during our visit, Kyrah can't wait to thank her in person!! thumbs up from adults is always ok BUT high fives from a six yr old is priceless!!  ...till next time, one happy Glam-ma!!"}
{"text":"I had the popular lasagna. I have never tried cashew milk before, nonetheless cashew cheese so I was a bit skeptical. But it ended up being absolutely delicious! The prices are very good for the amount of food you get and customer service was very friendly. I wish I had a vegan restaurant this good where I lived. -Aundronique"}
{"text":"I've gone there a total of 6 times and all 6 times they were rude. I really did try to give them a chance because the food is great but they're douche bags Im never going again"}
{"text":"The worst vegan place I have ever been. Ordered cheesecake and my husband had tacos. Cheesecake tasted like not fresh butter (although it is vegan butter probably), made a few bites and that was it. The package is cheap and in a result the slice of this cheesecake sticked to the lid. Tacos were ok, but not for this price. Nowhere to wash hands (it is more like food court place)."}
{"text":"Eating here with a group of 9 people  Mostly vegans.  The sweet girl at register made a mistake on one order and after 50 minutes refunded the money and said she would give him Her employee meal I spoke with manager telling her that she needs to make this right and give him a meal and not take it out of the girls benefits The manager said I agree and she should never have given him refund The manager said she appreciated my advice and said I should leave.  No problem plenty of places to eat in Vegas"}
{"text":"I asked my mom & boyfriend to join me here for dinner. Both Don't eat vegan food but I introduced them I ordered the vegan lasagna which was great by the way salad was amazing too. The place is very small not a lot of seating more of a to go joint a lil pricey because it is fresh & vegan but worth it parking no to bad parked at a meter food took about 20 mins it wasn't packed when I went but a lot of people ordered ahead to avoid the wait"}
{"text":"Simply Pure is located inside the Container Park which is really unique park on the 2nd. floor, the place is kinda small inside but cute tables and chairs outside only Chef Stacey was not there Sept.21 2014 Sunday around 1 something( I do keep detail notes) the staff there was very nice and friendly she give me the history about the place which was so kind and helpful, and I was able to taste some free samples of some Items, I had the chili cheese fries, and vegan chicken salad both was raw and delicious, the menu is very simply and pure, I can't wait to go back there and try other healthy Items, I think the highest Item on the menu is about $12.95"}
{"text":"The Nachos Grande are the best vegan nachos in the world. I enjoyed a full order with a Sweetheart cold pressed juice. I'm staying on the strip and it was definitely a good idea to come to Fremont Street, Container Park for dinner. Whenever I'm in Las Vegas I'll be coming back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a vegan restaurant in Container Park. After purchasing kids meals for my carnivores elsewhere in the park, I decided to treat myself to some veggie fare.   After nearly going broke, trying to feed the kids, I had to be a little more budget conscious when ordering. This proved ridiculously challenging at Simply Pure but then again, do budget friendly vegan restaurants actually exist?  Nevertheless, we entered Simply Pure and I had to kick out two of my kids to wait outside because we could not all fit in the cramped space. Although tight in space, it was bright, clean, and there is a large appetizing salad bar for view. I ordered the spring rolls and the vegan nachos to share. Both items totaled $20! So much for my budget.   We sat outside on the astro turf and the carnivorous children attacked the nachos! The dish was generously covered with soy meat and cheese. It was very flavorful but I wish there were more tomatoes. The spring rolls were absolutely delicious and the accompanying sweet and spicy sauce added the extra kick I was searching for.  I look forward to returning to Simply Pure and trying other items on the menu. I know the kids raved about the nachos!"}
{"text":"I feel its overpriced for the name Vegan. The food is good but not the price we pay for. Seriously for a sake of salad they gave just few leaves of mixed greens. Add tomotoes or nuts or something. The seating inside isnt good at all and so irritating that every time someone opens the door your hair will be all over your face. For the price there should be some good facility to eat since it was cold outside. Its way over priced You should instead go to VegeNation The staff seems rude, maybe for my color."}
{"text":"After spending a couple of hours at the Hoover Dam, my BF and I were hungry and we decided to check out Simply Pure and use the Groupon that I purchased.  Simply Pure is located in downtown Las Vegas at Container Park, a very cool family-friendly place with shops and food from local artists, chefs and vendors.  What makes it unique is all the buildings are all made of containers - very cool design!  We found Simply Pure on the second floor of the right side of Container Park.  It was a very small place with no indoor seating which I was kinda bummed out about because it was a chilly night.  But I was relieved that we found seating outdoors downstairs next to the heating lamps.    When I purchased the Groupon, I read that they specialize in raw vegan food, but the menu is not all raw.  For example, you can get your wrap in a tortilla instead of lettuce.  Honestly, my BF and I were relieved that it was not all raw because after walking all day we were hungry and wanted something that would fill us up.  Our Groupon came with two entrees and two fresh juices. I ordered the vegan chicken salad wrap (vegan chicken salad made with almonds and cashews, julienned cabbage, pico de gallo, and cashew cream sauce) and my BF ordered the nachos grande (corn chips, vegan \"protein\" beef, vegan cheddar cheese, fresh pico de gallo and avocado).  We shared our entrees and we thought they were both delicious!  The filling in the wrap was tasty and the nachos were awesome and tasted just like dairy nacho cheese.  Our fresh juices were great as well.  We really enjoyed coming to Container Park and checking out Simply Pure.  I would totally come back to try out the other menu items or the great looking salad bar."}
{"text":"Outstanding lasagna. I am new to vegetarianism, and I loved this dish. I will absolutely be back. Very reasonably priced for the portion size. They make the lasagna to order, so it takes 20 minutes. They let you know this up front. It is worth the wait. Even my extreme carnivore friend liked it."}
{"text":"It presents itself as a fast pick up and go cafe but both times that I have been there, it took at least 15min before receiving the food. It is well worth the wait!!! The raw tacos were so delicious and filling. I was able to eat my food for two meals instead of just one sitting. Recommendation, open a larger location so you can have more employees to supply the demand. My first visit, there was a line which discouraged some customers."}
{"text":"GET THE NACHOS. Great texture (super melty cheese and very tasty \"beef\"). Don't be scared to try it if you're not vegan (because I definitely am a meat eater and loved it). And also get the cheesecake- thought we didn't have any room after the nachos but somehow we managed. Great service here as well! I think the two girls working at the time were Brandi and Jamie and they were extremely helpful and fun to chat with"}
{"text":"This place is a rare find. SO glad we came upon it. Everything on the menu sounds amazing so if you can't decide then grab one of three sampler platters. It has a little bit of everything! We got sampler #3 and the lasagna. Honestly, every single item was AMAZING. I also love how they kept the zucchini noodles and jicama raw. Delicious and nutritious!"}
{"text":"Great food for vegans and non-vegans bc it's super tasty! The service is quick and very friendly, matching the hipster vegan vibe of the restaurant located within the container park downtown! They have a variety of juices and food including entree's and appetizers!!! All vegan of course! Give it a try if you haven't yet! There's nothing better than healthy delicious food!!"}
{"text":"I got excited when I saw a vegan place at the container park. I'm happy that there are more vegan places around so I wanted to support them and give them a try.  I got the \"beef\" tacos. They would've been good if they weren't so salty. It tasted like an entire can of salt was mixed into them.  I couldn't finish all three. The salt was just too much.   There salad bar looked really good and so did the spring rolls. I think I will try them next time. I also wish there were more vegan/vegetarian foods that didn't have imitation meat."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food was super fresh & they were constantly preparing more in the back. We had the nachos and they were so good! BEST vegan meat I've ever tasted & I've tasted quite a few! We also ordered the spring rolls & they were delicious as well.  The staff was incredibly nice, chef Stacey even came out and greeted us upon our arrival. The guy working the front gave is free samples of the almond truffle balls, the chocolate banana ganache, & a few other things from the salad bar.  All in all, I LOVE this place!! I definitely recommend it to everyone- both vegan & non vegan,  they're food is delicious & healthy!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend were super excited to try this place, unfortunately it was slightly disappointing. I will give 3 stars for the nice service, the portion size was huge, and the entrees themselves were not super bad. I had the nachos and they were pretty good but the whole time I just kept thinking that I could easily make this at home and probably better! My friend had the jicama nachos and said it was ok. We also ordered juices and omg they were AWFUL! We both took a sip of ours and they were both just NOT good. Good, organic, fresh pressed juices are supposed to taste smooth and good, NOT like soap! Very disappointing, We also left both feeling just a yucky type of full. Not the energized, cleansed, healthy way you feel after a great organic, raw meal full...but more of a yucky, bleh kind of full...the full where you feel like you should just have some fruit for dinner. We are both vegan and eat at all the vegetarian, vegan restaurants in Vegas and have never felt like this after.  Also even though the portions are very generous, the prices are high! A little to high. I'm really on the fence about this place. We both decided we will not return but I do feel like Simply Pure is true to it's word of a raw vegan place."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat with a solid selection of delicious entrees. Whether you are a full time vegan or just trying to find a healthier alternative this is a place you have to try!"}
{"text":"It's so hard to find healthy food in Vegas, but this place has managed to do it! Wonderful juice and entrees. I'll definitely be back next time I'm Vegas."}
{"text":"Aside from being The BEST vegan meal we've had in Las Vegas.. taste buds are in complete euphoria!!! Great customer service, overall a fantastic experience! Also gave suggestions for other great vegan options in the area! Small, quaint and full of eclectic feels."}
{"text":"Got the Sampler 1 platter to try the zucchini pasta, nachos and mock chicken wraps. It's very hard to eat it all together since it's just packed on one plate but overall it was delicious! The nachos were definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"***** Five Stars!  This is another great vegan option if you find yourself in the downtown area of Las Vegas. It is located inside Container Park. It is on the right side of the park as soon as you walk in through the front entrance on the first level. The restaurant is very small. I think there was only four tables total. There is plenty of seating outside the restaurant though. The server will bring your food out to you. The store and kitchen appeared to be very clean.++++That's always good!!  The food was excellent!! Everything was very fresh and tasted great.  Full order of the Nachos Grande $11.95 - Excellent! We ordered it with the cashew nacho cheese. The full order was enough for two people.  Raw Chili Cheese Fries $11.95 - I did not care for the jicama that is used to replace the potatoes. Everything else tasted great on the dish. I just don't care for the texture of the jicama. They would have been great with real fries. If you like jicama, then you will enjoy the dish.  Mama Mia Lasagna $10.95 - Excellent! The ricotta cheese is replaced with a tofu ricotta. It has the vegan beef and mozzarella, along with fresh spinach in a sun-dried tomato marinara.  Asian Tacos $10.95 - Excellent! The tacos were served with the vegan beef, avocado, cabbage, vermicelli noodles, and sriracha, all wrapped in a tortilla. We ordered it with the field greens on the side.  I will definitely be back to try some more menu items. Give this place a try, even if your not vegan. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"A few pals and I went to the Container Park today, and I was stoked to try something from this vegan joint! We shared the nachos (it's a good portion) and they received an A+ from me and my meat-loving friends. It was creamy, fresh, and flavorful! Just the perfect snack to eat outside on the terrace. The service was great! Very informative and helpful. Don't be afraid to ask and sample. I am definitely looking forward to coming through the downtown area to grab another thing or two from Simply Pure!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am not a vegan, but I do eat very healthy and like to swing vegan from time to time, especially since I mostly eat dairy-free anyway. I love a good salad or veggie dish any time.  I went to the container park with my family last week and I was craving a salad, so when I saw a vegan place I knew I had to try it. I ordered the Thai basil spring rolls and the coconut kale salad. The spring rolls were good, fresh, and the sauce had a nice light kick of heat to it. But nothing exceptional. BUT THE SALAD. Oh, glory hallelujah THAT SALAD!! First off, I ordered a HALF order and it was HUGE. But I wish I'd ordered the full because it was THE most delicious salad I've ever had, and I CANNOT stop thinking about it a week later! It was salty and sweet and bacon-y (that's from the bacon flavored coconut!) and crisp and fresh and just tasted like 20 kinds of amazing. I wish I could figure out how to recreate it at home. And I wish I lived in Vegas, I'd be there DAILY to get more of that salad. Thankfully I DO live close enough that I can run and grab one every couple of months, though! Yeay! On a side note, they also had some desserts that looked AMAZING, I'll be back for those next time!"}
{"text":"Awesome vegan nachos!   Tasty fruit salad! Mmmmmm, I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"JUST WOW.  I visited Vegas this weekend, and a friend brought me here late on Friday night.  Super rad location.  It's in \"Container Park\" this shopping center made up of shops all housed in shipping containers.  There's a giant flame throwing praying mantis sculpture as you walk into this hipster haven.  The Simply Pure restaurant is nestled amongst a bunch of cool little artsy/hipster shops and bars.  There's live music playing in the common area.  After looking at the promisingly large menu,  I ordered the vegan lasagna and chocolate cheesecake. Service was very nice. You can sit inside at a few tables or outside at a couple tables.  We waited about 15 minutes to get our food.    This lasagna... OMG... this lasagna... it was soooo damn delicious that I made my friend bring me back on Saturday night to have it again.  I kid you not... I HAD to have this lasagna two nights in a row because it's incredible.  The portion is huge... and they do NOT skimp on the cashew cheese.  Decadent.  It came with a nice green salad too.   The chocolate cheesecake was yummy, it came with a berry sauce.    The second night I also tried some of the raw angel hair zucchini pasta my friend ordered. She ordered it with mushrooms and basil.  I was thinking \"hmm.. raw zucchini pasta... hmmm\" when she ordered it.  Yet, after trying it, honestly, I was shocked, because it's so healthy sounding and yet soooo tasty!   I'm just truly so so impressed with this food.  YES PLEASE!!!"}
{"text":"Great food in container park. They have a good selection of vegan friendly food including raw options. The Raw Vegan pasta with cashew Alfredo sauce is EXCELLENT! The chips they use are from a bag instead if being hand made and dehydrated, but other than that everything is fresh and delicious. They were really awesome about handling a misunderstanding so you can expect good customer service. It's a bit pricey, but it's worth the extra money to have a healthy option"}
{"text":"This kitchen has an order counter and a small kitchen behind it where the chef works. No indoor seating but there's nice tables outside looking over the park kids center thing. I tried the raw nachos. They were served cold but I guess raw food is always cold food. The crumble on them was really tasty but I prefer more Chilli spice on my fo-meat crumble. They gave me a choice between daiya or cashew nacho cheeze sauce. I chose cashew nacho cheeze sauce but they were definitely skimpy with their cheeze drizzle. I needed more cheeze and more spice on my nachos. They gave me a little extra salsa for my nachos the salsa was alright. M ordered the chixen salad wrap and on the side they put a big pile of chips but they didn't give him any salsa with his chips or anything so I thought that was sloppy. They could have been more generous with their sauces in general. M's wrap was pretty big he could barely finish. Tasted good. Also the avocado on my nachos was really tiny piece. let me be clear the wrap was big and there were a lot of chips on my nacho plate. I felt like they were very reserved about their sauces/avocado/spice and that was a let down."}
{"text":"I am not vegan but do love raw vegan food. I was very excited to see this place when my husband and I visited the new Container Park. It wasn't a meal time but we wanted to try something so we decided to split the \"chicken\" salad wraps. Now even during non mealtimes my husband is a big eater so I suspected we would have to find him another snack at one of the other restaurants but this seemed to satisfy him. Not to mention he is most decidedly not vegan and declared the food to be \"awesome\". I would definitely make another trip for the food alone."}
{"text":"I had the Lasagna and Chocolate cheeze cake... SOOOO GOOD! Staff was friendly. I'll be back my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Had a raw vegan lasagna , I thought it was a little bland but then I added there cashew cheese and then it was creamy and amazing! Friendly and helpful front staff"}
{"text":"I had a five-star experience the first time I went, but had the opposite this time around. The two girls working were snobby (hiding under their hats) from the moment I walked in. After getting my food, I wasn't told about the status of my juice. The server simply put down my food and walked away. After 5 minutes, I noticed the extra avocado I'd paid for was an insult--it was about a quarter avocado. Then I noticed a toothpick hanging out in my zucchini pasta. I figured I'd go inside to see the status of my juice and ask for more avocado. After being ignored for a couple of minutes, one of the girls said in a deathly tone the name of my juice. After mentioning the lack of avocado, she felt she was right, but offered to give me more avocado on the side with a bad attitude. Upon receiving my juice and my extra avocado (another quarter or less) I mentioned the toothpick. The server was livid. She said she didn't know how it could have possibly gotten in there since \"they don't have toothpicks in the back\" and even offered to let me look. By this point, the four other customers in there were aware of the issues. I said, sarcastically, \"Okay, so I totally just brought a toothpick from home to throw in my food and blame it on you.\" The server was absolutely certain that that's what I'd done. She said \"you must have put it in there.\" I said \"I'm never coming back.\" And she gave a pissed off \"buh-bye\" as closure to my exit. It's obvious that the owners/management have stopped caring about quality service by being okay with hiring the two girls that \"served\" me today. Biggest waste of $24 for a zucchini pasta and juice."}
{"text":"Bruh. This is one of the best vegan spots I have ever been to.  The Asian tacos were a straight foodgasm.  Portion sizes are fantastic- great amounts which isn't usually seen in the vegan world.  So full, so happy, and didn't dent the wallet."}
{"text":"I love it here so much! They have such filling vegan food! It can get packed so try to call ahead! The lasagna is the bomb! BEST LASAGNA I HAVE EVER HAD! Must eat in Vegas, vegan or not you will love it!"}
{"text":"The nachos with cashew cheese are amazing, as is the lasagna! And the zucchini pasta with alfredo is SOOO GOOOD.  Not a personal fan of the pesto or marinara but thats just my taste buds, get the sampler so u can try all 3 sauces for yourself. The chicken salad is the only thing that wasnt very convincing (didnt taste like chicken) it WAS tasty, just not reminiscent of chicken, but considering it was raw and healthy i was happy with it. You can get the lettuce tacos/wraps in a tortilla instead if you dont want it fully raw. For something lighter i love the new asian salad.  The pure angel juice was fantastic.  I highly recommend this place whether vegan or not!"}
{"text":"Well the food was great and fattening and really filled me up but the customer service was lacking. The girl at the cash register was super nice and cool but her manager was so unhelpful. Maybe they should switch positions ....."}
{"text":"Do your self a favor and try this place , the owner chef is friendly and very informative.  Had the most amazing vegan Nachos and cashew cheese yummy stuff. The key lime dessert is just perfection, the fresh juices done as you order."}
{"text":"I wish I could say that Stacey took my previous review seriously, but the \"service\" has only gotten worse. This eatery not only doesn't answer the phone (because you have to call to confirm Eat24 orders since the staff is negligent with checking email / notifications), their ringer is off and voicemail is full.   This may be fine for dine-in, but 20 minutes just to confirm a carry-out order is far too long. I'd suggest going around the corner to Vegenation, though. More pleasant dining environment, plus they serve wine! Best of luck to you, Stacey. Las Vegas needs you, but only when you're ready to do it right."}
{"text":"New to being Vegan. Hard to find places to eat at home and it's even harder while on vacation. My wife found Simply Pure online. Nice little place Downtown Las Vegas. I had the tacos, we shared nachos, and the wife had lasagna. It took 20 minutes for the lasagna but it was worth the wait. This is my new place to eat when I'm in town."}
{"text":"My hesitancy about coming here stems from the knowledge that one could make most of these dishes at home in not a lot of time and for a fraction of the price. It's expensive here.  The vegan chicken lettuce wraps are very tasty, but it starts to get to be too much salty white slop when you get to your third one. Really needs something else to go with that.  The zucchini pasta with pesto sauce is tasty, but super, SUPER OILY and salty.  The burrito/taco wraps are just okay. It was dry and could use more flavor other than salt and cumin.  The juices are all right. I just can't justify the price for any of it though."}
{"text":"Found this place while looking for some vegan/vegetarian options. The location (inside the downtown container park) was super cute, in the downtown container park. I got the tacos, my wife got the nachos grande.  Both were EXCELLENT.  Service was also impeccable."}
{"text":"I went with my wife and a friend. We all had the same opinion. Ok food at a cute little street mall. Most of the products use \"Beyond meat\" which I personally do not like. The smoothies were too pungent. Tacos and Zucchini spaghetti were good. Would go to Vegenation around the corner instead ( we ended up here because Vegenation was packed and we did not want to wait)"}
{"text":"This place is the first place I'm giving a 5 to since I've moved here! First off, I'm new to the vegan game (clarify, not a vegan by any means) and this place is doing it right! I had the zucchini pasta with cashew Alfredo sauce topped with vegan need and mushrooms. Packed with flavor, and extremely tasty! Not to mention, the salad bar choices were phenomenal! Every thing served was fresh, organic, and raw. Additionally, the service was well over 5-star worthy! Derek (sp?) was great... He let us try things before we ordered and was extremely friendly and knowledgable about what was being served. He even gave is a free sample of dessert (a truffle of some sort with dates... Delicious) Overall, I am extremely please with this gem. It is located in Container Park so it offers a great option for those who want to enjoy a night out with friends, while still providing some healthy options!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were really excited to try this place, but it was disappointing. We got three raw vegan entrees - the jicama chili fries, the zucchini noodles with cashew sauce, and a salad. The sauce on the noodles was ok, but it was super plain and not terribly tasty. The cheese sauce on the jicama chili fries was ok, but the whole dish was super heavy and did not sit well in the stomach - we both felt sick the rest of the day! And... neither service (inattentive) or atmosphere (none) were great."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 60/100  Simply Pure is a fresh, modern take on vegan food and less hippie dippie than most people think. A while back I tried her vegan lasagna at a startup event at The Innevation Center and most recently tried her sampler platter and I can say that Chef Stacey Dougan does vegan food well!   I liked the lasagna and it was flavorful and better than expected. This was my first time having vegan lasagna and I would definitely order it again.   The Ultimate Sampler Platter #3 was delish as well! It had a little bit of everything on the menu.   I've had many of these items before, but some items (like the jicama chili cheese fries) were a first for me and may be a little out there for those new to vegan food. The sampler included:   - Zucchini Pasta Trio -- spiraled zucchini - refreshing and flavorful. Loved it.  - Nachos Grande, Vegan Taco & Chicken Salad Lettuce Wrap were delish. These were my fave in the sampler.  - Jicama Chili Cheese Fries -- a little different, with the combination of refreshing jicama slices and chili cheese, but I enjoyed it. This may be an acquired taste for some, especially those new to vegan food.    All I can say is that I enjoyed it! Her dishes made my body feel good, physically. Felt less tired, felt more energized and nourished. (It was a Saturday with the family and I usually have Hawai'ian or \"junk-cheat day food.\")  I'm looking forward to having the lasagna again and trying the juices, enchiladas, tacos, and of course, the desserts!"}
{"text":"The people here are very nice but their food is not good. Vegan food should, in my book, employ a range of delicious ingredients, not 15 different kinds of soy in one meal. Full disclosure: I reacted badly to eating so much processed soy in one sitting. Nuts, chickpeas, miso, various pastes and plant-derived flavorings can really amp up a vegan dish. Vegetables should be put into play! The food did not taste bad--but its substance is overprocessed and as a result, I think it's frankly unhealthy."}
{"text":"So good! The place is small but it is delicious! We knew this was a vegan place but didn't expect raw vegan food and then we were very pleasantly surprised! My husband and I shared a sampler plate that I think had a little of every item they sell. The nachos were yummy! The different sauces on the zucchini pasta were great! I will be back next time I'm in Vegas! And I love the container park.. Cool setting for this type of restaurant! Inside is small and kind of cramped if you're eating In but it's definitely worth it for the delicious food! Wish there was a place like this near my house."}
{"text":"I work right across the street from this place and I order lunch here all the time, my favorites their lasagna and Zucchini noodles which you can build on your own, I usually have mine with cashew alfredo sauce, mushrooms and \"beef\" and it's boooooomb!"}
{"text":"The nachos were blah and not that great. Plain and boring, no beans, tomato, green onion, jalape√±o slices or any of the other usual toppings that are on nachos, especially vegan nachos. My friend and I shared these and thought they were just ok. Then we went to Nacho Daddy's, and their vegan nachos made us realize the nachos here were pieces of cardboard under bland cheese sauce. With all the new vegan places opening up in the area, I'm in no hurry to come back to this place on my next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"I would usually give this place 4 stars because it's a little pricey but what the hell, it's Vegas. Don't come here if you're cheap.   It's not too bad but for that price I would like to be able to sit down and get drink refills and such. Other than that, the food is incredible. I got the raw tacos and Megan got the \"chickn\" tacos. They were both out of this world.  If you're looking for some great vegan food in Vegas, this is the place to go. There's nowhere to sit in the store but there are plenty of tables just outside (under cover in case it's raining) and you can sit and look around at the really cool container park that it's in.   Just up the road from the famous Fremont street. We parked, ate, and them walked there and hung out."}
{"text":"The main reason I traveled from the Strip to the Fremont area was to visit Simply Pure after researching vegan places online and I was simply delighted that the food fit the name. I had the vegan tacos in lettuce wraps with the tortilla chips and my husband had the Asian tacos. He's a meat-eater and said he couldn't tell the difference (important to him, being used to certain meat \"alternatives\") and he enjoyed them a lot. My lettuce-wrapped tacos were simple yet delicious and light- I left comfortably full. The place was very bright inside with the new chairs and tables. I'd eat here again when we return to Vegas! Next time, I would try one of the fresh juices. I loved the location inside Container Park, which added to the whole laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Me & my Friend ate here on December 30, 2017. My Vegan Beef Lasagna was simply purelicous..lol I was really hoping it would've been a bigger establishment. Very, very small this restaurant. Nevertheless, I will revisit a second time.."}
{"text":"Love the concept of this place and the convenience of the Container Park, but my meal wasn't very inspiring. The chef burned my grilled cheese so I had to wait for her to remake it. When I received the remade one, it was kind of small and not much to it for the price. I enjoyed the cheesecake but it was also pretty small for the price. If you're in need of a vegan place at the Container Park Id give this place a try. If I go back If definitely try ordering something else."}
{"text":"This place has great food to offer however it's pretty small and have limited tables but one can take away. Every thing they serve here is vegan and super delicious. It's definitely a place not to be missed because it's on the ground floor and not highlighted the way a restaurant should be."}
{"text":"The best healthy food I've ever had!!!! They make the food light & clean but also lots of flavor....must try!! The only thing is waiting time is pretty long, we waited 20+mins outside for a pasta."}
{"text":"Will definitely be back!!! The nachos were so so good! Cashew nacho cheese, tasted just like the real thing.  Will most definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I'm the foodie of the family, but my daughter introduced me to this fabulous restaurant. She told me to order the vegan tacos and they were life-changing. Normally, I need a tortilla for my tacos, but not here! They are served in a lettuce wrap (super healthy) and you won't even miss the tortilla. I sure wish I knew how they made their cheese sauce. It is too good for words!  The young man who made my tacos also gave me a complimentary raw vegan dessert. It was interesting...but a very thoughtful gesture.  You can truly taste the love in the food."}
{"text":"This is an unbiased review :). Four stars, because I'm not vegan.  One whom is vegan would probably provide 5 stars! I'm not vegan, let me state this and make it clear.  However, a dear friend of mine adores this place in Container Park. Yes, pod containers.  Always a smiling and friendly staff who makes it a point in greeting you as soon as the door opens. The air conditioner is always working well, it is over a hundred degrees out!  My friend is addicted with their lasagna from here.   I've tried the enchiladas and those are delicious. Who knew!"}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian food in a strange setting. It's a Container Park which is a food court made out of shipping containers.  Good choices and reasonable prices. Freshly made. Our pasta was made out of zucchini."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! It is a cute little restaurant in the Container Park (Downtown). The food was absolutely delicious! We ordered the large nachos with cashew cheese and lasagna. My boyfriend is not a vegan, but cannot stop talking about these two wonderful dishes! The best lasagna i have ever had (meat or otherwise)! My only regret is not ordering the cheesecake. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Raw Vegan Options in Las Vegas!  Located inside the Container Center. They card after a certain hour so don't forget your ID. Sorry if you want to eat late here and youre under 21.  Went back twice for the almond cashew chicken wrap so good. Filling. Nourushing. Def recommend.  Also had the ginger, carot, apple juice. Very good.  Thank you stacy for being here. Not too many good vegan options near the strip.  Simply Pure is a life saver !"}
{"text":"The vegan spring rolls and nachos were finger lickin' good!!! It's right on the old strip and worth the stop! Choose this and bypass the greasy burger joint that dresses you in hospital gowns... One will leave you feeling great for multiple reasons... The other... Ick."}
{"text":"So delicious!!! I've been a vegetarian since 2012 and I wanna go vegan. I saw this place on yelp and have been wanting to try it since I discovered it. I also like to support black owned businesses. The customer service was great. Fast friendly and efficient service. I ordered the enchiladas and it came with a side of fresh greens. My food was soooo good. The enchiladas were fresh and very flavorful. The fresh greens were good. This was my first time eating fresh greens. I also grabbed an organic lemonade very good also. My friend had the spring rolls and said they were great. We grabbed two cheesecakes to go. The cheesecake was Not as sweet as I would've like but still good. The building is cute and very trendy. I would recommend this place and for sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Zomg zomg zomg the lasagna is so good. For desert I got the chocolate cheesecake.   Service was kind and knew their stuff. And the music was nice, too."}
{"text":"Love this place! Deff recommend the grilled cheese it's amazing!!! Also the cheesecake too"}
{"text":"I had the zucchini spaghetti with the cashew cheese sauce, it was excellent! I also got the TLC juice which was also delicious. I love that you can fill up on this stuff and it doesn't make you tired or feel like crap.   I don't care for much for the new gentrified downtown, but if it means more Vegan spots then it may actually be a good thing (:"}
{"text":"Flavorful and delicious.This is my favorite vegan place. I crave their \"mock\" chicken salad wraps all of the time. The lasagna is better then meat versions I have tried at other restaurants. The strawberry cheese cake is the bomb. I can't wait to go back. If you \"check in\" from yelp you get 10% off too."}
{"text":"Very delicious for vegan food, but probably not if it's going to be your first time eating vegan, and if you are super hungry (too many good buffets to choose from).   I got the sampler #1 and it was perfect for two people. The taco was a bit strong in taste but perfectly balanced with the nachos and zucchini pasta! Also, you should sample the custom salads... It's amazing!"}
{"text":"I found this place to be total heaven! We ordered the tacos and the zucchini pasta with a cashew sauce. The cashew sauce was out of this world and I can only hope I can make something like his remotely close at home!  So delicious! There were plenty of left overs as well. I have zero complaints about this place. I did not notice to much salt either but they are so friendly, I am sure they would make you something else if you don't care for your food. I ordered a couple of her e cookbooks as well! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite place to eat!! Great friendly service,  (which is a rarity around there)  and the Food was fantastic! I had the nachos and my Sun had the lasagna, I recommend both. Thank you Simply Pure, for a great meal. See you soon"}
{"text":"Being relatively new to the vegan scene we have been exploring new places everywhere we go. Considering how it can be challenging being truly vegan while traveling, we found Simply Pure to be an oasis in a vast desert of carnivorous choices! Their sample platter left us wanting more! The nachos were incredible and we ended up getting a generous serving of lasagna to go...that was a welcome treat for us later.  If you are traveling through Vegas and want to try something unique or if you're a vegan looking for tasty options, you have to stop at Simply Pure!"}
{"text":"I never knew that Vegan food could be so amazing! Had the lasagna today and it's literally something I would eat daily, unbelievably good. Can't wait to come back and enjoy this little gem again soon. Absolutely fabulous! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Vegan Restaurant in Las Vegas and Simply Pure has been in my bookmarks for a while. It's a tiny restaurant in Container Park with about 10 seats inside. While this specific restaurant could improve a bit on their customer service (smiling more, being a little more talkative, speaking louder), their food was still affordable, tasty, healthy, and came out fairly quick. I swear, Vegan places have the nicest customers ever! Their customers who were dining there were so helpful and were very knowledgable about the type of food that they have. The other customers recommended the nachos and the lasagna. Unfortunately, they ran out of lasagna by the time we got there which was around 2pm on a Sunday. But the nachos were amazing and the full order is good enough for 2 people to share! My friends and I don't really eat vegan food, but we would definitely come back here again to try other dishes they have.  Btw, love the music they were playing in there. Old school R&B and some hip-hop."}
{"text":"I am not Vegan at all but this place makes me feel like I could be. I have had the vegan nachoes here multiple times as well as the zucchini pesto and let me just say that I have never been disappointed. The vegan nachoes are out of this world good. Light, tasty, delicious, and filling but not using all your daily  calories. It's amazing.  I honestly don't know how they do it but it's always a pleasure. The zucchini pesto is also pretty awesome.  Pesto is homemade and of course vegan. The portion is big and filling  because the zucchini Is you pasta.   Only real downside to this place is that they don't have a seating area of their own, so you are forced to take it to go or eat outside. In the summer it is pretty unbearable. So plan ahead with  that.   The staff really impressed me here because  They are really smart about their products and always recommend excellent choices. I will be back for more tasty vegan food!!"}
{"text":"The hardest thing for me to do, when visiting a new-to-me restaurant, is narrowing my options down, as to not waste.  Simply Pure answers our foodie prayers with several sampler plates from which you can choose.   I got the Sampler #1, which comes with a Zucchini Pasta Trio, Nacho Grande, and the \"Chicken\" Salad Lettuce Wrap. At #13.95, this plate could feed two.  I'm not a fan of tomatoes or cheese (even vegan cheese), and they were very accommodating to my modified order requests.   Everything was good, but the nachos were my favorite. The food was fresh and light, yet filling. It was the perfect lunch for a hot summer day.  I thought the prices were very reasonable for the quality and amount of food that you're given.   The place is small, with 5 mini tables, big enough for 2 patrons at each (total of 10 seats), but they seem to get a lot of traffic.    The employees were very nice. There was enjoyable music playing in the background.    It's located within the Container Park, and if it weren't for me purposefully looking for it and GPS leading me here, I'd never have found it."}
{"text":"Update 6/2/17: Thanks for taking the time to reply Stacy. Being someone that is vegan, gluten and soy-free I understand the challenges to eat out and cook this type of cuisine. And for that reason I didn't want to give less than a glowing review, but I was being honest and fair. My meal just missed the mark for me. As a  first time customer, I didn't know I had other choices instead of the beef. I mentioned my allergies when ordering. I would have been happy to strap on an apron and make myself some grilled mushrooms.   As for the salad, there was no dressing on the side and I picked out wilted slimy lettuce (this happens - no foul.) Again, I would have asked about a dressing, but the cashier was short with other customers, as you mentioned, probably due to being busy and stressed. To me rude is not just telling someone to piss off, it's demeanor and body language. And in my opinion (aka, my review) that is what I sensed.   On a high note, It's awesome you have options for vegetarians and vegans in Vegas, I just think some fine tuning could be beneficial. If I didn't have to avoid soy and wheat, I'm sure I would have enjoyed another menu item. No disrespect at all, just stating my opinion since I cook this type of food daily.    Original review: Wanted to try this place while on vacation. Very small space and not much charm, which is fine especially if the food was amazing. I ordered the Asian lettuce wraps without fake beef and the side salad. The flavors were okay, but underwhelming. I could have made them at home for $2, but I paid $12. The salad was completely undressed, it was a pile of mixed greens.   My husband had the pesto panini and really liked it, so I guess that is notable.  The cashier wasn't very friendly and I had to walk back to my hotel with sticky hands."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about this place!!! I am here visiting from the sf Bay Area and I must say that I am very impressed! I had the vegan nachos and tried to lasagna as well! Thumbs up for both! Anytime I find myself in Vegas you can rest assure that I will be here! Please open one of these in Berkeley Ca. You will fit right in!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a vibe that reminds me of my favorite vegan joints in Atlanta, with the flavors to match - wholesome food that satisfies the soul.  I can't believe it took me this long to check it out when it is so close to my office.  I got the sampler intending to try it out and eat the rest for dinner (it is a lot of food), but it was so good I ate it all in one sitting.  I'm so glad you're here, Chef Stacey!"}
{"text":"This is a MUST to visit when in town!! If you want pure foods that taste amazing and make you FEEL even better, you've gotta stop here!! Get a plate of nachos or a TLT and absolutely have a fresh juice with it. The cashew cheese is literally sooooo good!! I have been here 3 times in the last 48 hours and I literally want to order multiple entrees!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Vegas cuisine in Vegas !!! Relaxed atmosphere , food is always fresh and the staff is great especially AMY !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Asian salad and fire nachos grande with cashew nacho cheese. And I'm not even vegetarian. Would definitely recommend it Simplypure!"}
{"text":"I've patronized this business since it opened. When it first opened, I really enjoyed it. Went today and the staff has completely changed along with the flavors of the food. My food tasted how non vegan people would expect it to taste. Bland, dry, flat and unappetizing!    Also, when I asked the lady to bring me a napkin and fork for my nachos, she acted like how dare I ask her. I left a tip and I'm sitting right in front of the place. No inconvenience imposed...Attitude was had.  Please revamp the staff with people who have a flair for seasoning vegan food with good INergy. Until then, no thanks..."}
{"text":"The nachos grandes tricked my carnivorous cousin into thinking that he was eating ground beef. They are definitely a must try when you visit the Container Park. The \"meat\" was perfectly portioned on to  perfectly crispy corn tortilla chips, then topped with creamy avocado and gooey \"cheddar cheese\". I wish that the nachos had some heat to give them another dimension of flavor. The chef could have made a jalape√±o salsa or a Scotch Bonnet pepper vinaigrette to go on the side."}
{"text":"I had the lasagna and it was melt in your mouth delicious. Hands down the best lasagna I have ever had in my life. The dressing on the salad was also wonderful. The service was fast and the staff was courteous. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Walking around in the desert sun we didn't want alcohol or sugar so happening upon this place in a cute and funky shopping area was our oasis.   The place is small, only a few tables, but all we wanted was a juice to go so it was perfect. We got a green juice with kale and other fresh veggies. It was called liquid courage.   Upon the first sip we instantly felt better!   While we didn't eat anything the menu looked just as good as the juice tasted...will have to come back for the jicama fries!!!"}
{"text":"Best. Vegan. Restaurant. Ever. No joke. We were there in June & I'm still craving the nachos. We got the half order which wasn't enough for both of us, because I could've eaten a tub by myself. Also got the jicama chili cheese fries which were good but would've been better with regular potato fries. I personally don't care for jicama fries. My husband got the grilled cheese and ate it up before I could even try it, so I'm guessing he liked it. I got the lasagna as my main course and it was delicious. A huge portion though, and after everything else we ate, I couldn't finish it. I've been a vegetarian for 20+ years and have tried lots of different vegetarian 'beef' recipes. The vegan protein 'beef' here is by far the best I've ever eaten. If they ever decide to sell it online, I'll definitely be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Simply Pure offers some of the best raw food I've ever eaten.  My husband and I came here on a Sunday afternoon to find something healthier to eat after  overindulging all weekend long -- a typical Vegas weekend full of rich food and too much to drink.  I had done a bit of searching online to find an interesting and unique restaurant to check out; Simply Pure definitely fit the bill.  Because we had our car with us, getting downtown from the Strip was easy and fast.  (Note: you'll have to pay to park when you visit Container Park.)    Upon arrival at Container Park, we were both impressed at the lovely and vibrant space.  Simply Pure was easy to find once we consulted the map.  It's upstairs overlooking the green space.  We were a little disappointed to see that there was no indoor seating (we're spoiled SoCal people who have a 10 degree comfort range when it comes to temperature) which meant we would be sweating while eating, but no one else shopping seemed to mind the triple digit heat.  We placed our order and chose a table right outside the restaurant overlooking the lower level. It was cool to see that  you could buy alcoholic beverages at other places within Container Park and enjoy them throughout the park without problem -- next time.  We were drawn in by the nachos but then saw the combo plate for $16.99.  It included three kinds of raw zucchini pasta, nachos, and chicken salad.  I was still recovering from last night's buffet and didn't think I could eat much so we chose to share this plate.  That was a good move considering how incredibly filling the food was.  The zucchini pasta came with three different sauces:  a bright and fresh tomato sauce, a green pesto that was dark and hearty, and a creamy alfredo-type sauce.  My favorite was the tomato sauce, but the others were quite good in their own ways as well.    The nachos were the bomb!  They're so freaking good that it's no surprise so many reviews mention them.  The crispy chips were covered with TVP (textured vegetable protein) meat and a creamy cheese sauce (both vegan obviously) and topped with avocado.    Our last item was the chicken salad which I believe the guy said was made with nuts.  I haven't had such a delicious version of raw chicken salad before.  It was light, refreshing, and full of flavor.  Very unique and delicious!    Great location, good service, and delicious, filling, and healthy food.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"We were very happy to find this vegan option in Vegas.  Located on the container park, it had a cool surrounding atmosphere in the old downtown.  The meat substitutes were really well done and the jicama fries were fantastic.  I definitely recommend the large sampler!"}
{"text":"Excellent.   Just excellent.   We tried the ultimate sampler 3 and the kale coconut bacon salad.     Amazing!   I was very impressed with the raw vegan items.  Sometimes the coldness and raw flavor can really be a let down but not here.   The flavors were amazing!   I might not have been a huge fan of the pesto sauce but the other two sauces made up for it.  The jicama chili fries were just ok but the nachos were amazing!   Also let me just say my boyfriend doesn't eat many vegetables let alone salad and he ate the kale salad 2 says in a row.   I had to fight him just to get a bite!  It must be good!   It is quite expensive but you can't really expect less with a niche place like this.     All in all I can't wait to come back here and eat that salad!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo amazing!! Had the enchiladas, AMAZING. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Cette petite √©choppe tr√®s color√©e ne paye pas de mine mais derri√®re le paravent il s'y pr√©pare des esp√®ces de Bentos tr√®s app√©tissants. Au vue de la taille gargantuesque de ces derniers, nous optons pour la Asian Salad en taille m√©dium ce qui suffit amplement pour un d√©jeuner sur le pouce. La salade comprend de l'avocat, des nouilles de riz, des champignons saut√©s et de la salade de choux/fenouil/laitue. Nous nous sommes r√©gal√©es. Je conseille de m√™me leurs jus de fruits √† la centrifugeuse!"}
{"text":"A few months ago I went Vegan for a short period of time. I had a really hard time finding vegan restaurants and didn't have much energy to cook during the transition to Vegan. We came here because there were options like vegan lasagne that were something I could get my husband to eat too, rather than only dishes we both hadn't heard of.  That being said the lasagne looked delicious so we ordered 2 of them. First of all this place is tiny and we had to sit behind the refrigerator and right next to the door whilst waiting for our food. When we got our food it tasted very salty and like something that's trying too hard to be something it's not. I'm guessing there were a lot of soy product in it, because it had that salty bitter taste to it, without any real substance.  I gave up being vegan a few days later. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Amazing Vegan Spot in Downtown. The Lasagna was so delicious, did not taste Vegan. I haven't had lasagna since I became vegan and this was so delicious. Chef Stacey was there and she was super sweet. Definitely want to go back when in town."}
{"text":"Really awesome food. Everything is healthy and nice tasting. The seating although is pretty small. Maybe at maximum 12 people could sit in there but it would be tight."}
{"text":"Food is good.   Kind of pricey.   Customer service is weak.  The wait was long.   I ordered 3 things at 1 o'clock on a Thursday and waited half an hour.   & The place is really small.   I'd recommend getting your food to go and eating it somewhere in the container park patio where it isn't so crowded."}
{"text":"If I could make food like this I would go vegan. Ive eaten at this place everyday this week (I'm here for work).  I've had the chicken salad  lettuce wraps, the lasagna and the Asian tacos. Everything is delicious.  The service is a little slow becouse they make everything to order but worth the wait."}
{"text":"While visiting Las Vegas we went to downtown Las Vegas and found this totally vegan restaurant on Fremont St. The food was excellent and loved all the raw options."}
{"text":"Perfect place for Vegans and Vegetarians!  Located on the second floor of Container Park.  Service was super friendly.  Only outdoor seating.    I've been wanting to try zucchini pasta and this place has it!  You can choose the type of sauce and toppings you want.  The first topping is free.  I got the cashew nut sauce with mushroom and vegan beef.    Omg, it was amazing.  Zucchini is a wonderful replacement for regular pasta.  Who knew??  The cashew nut sauce is a great healthy alternative to alfredo sauce.  I dare say that I prefer cashew nut sauce to alfredo sauce now.  The vegan beef really had me surprised.  I loved the texture and the taste.  Even my boyfriend, who hates substitute meats, liked the vegan beef!   I wished this place existed in LA!  I would love to try the other dishes here.  Looking for vegan or vegetarian food in Las Vegas?  You need to try this place!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, but the food and recipes are delicious and flavorful! I've found myself frequently eating at Simply pure a lot lately, while Ive worked out in downtown. The salad bar is full of a variety of savory options if you cant decide, or want to try a little of everything, but it's all good! I know I'll continue coming here! I only wish they had some warm vegan meal options, maybe in the future? but it's definitely satisfied my taste buds and made me more aware of what deliciousness the vegan diet has to offer!"}
{"text":"The place is cute and small like a cafe should be. We are the nachos and chicken wraps so good. Grabbed a beer ate outside and enjoyed Great service!"}
