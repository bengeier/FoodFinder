{"text":"Food and service was great! We celebrated our sisters 40th birthday by having brunch here. Found via open table. Nabila, the service manager was so helpful and attentive. She made the occasion that much more memorable. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a hotel restaurant. Good atmosphere. Both servers I had the two nights I ate here were friendly and attentive. Wine prices are reasonable. Food is cooked well (I had steak one night, seafood pasta the next). The only thing I'd like to see is more selection on the menu."}
{"text":"Not sure if it was the time of day or because it is a restaurant within a hotel.  Went in for lunch with a few classmates, the server took awhile before she acknowledged us.  The food was okay but took forever to arrive.  Our group ordered simple salads, flatbread, and soup.   I had the chicken mango salad, the chicken was very dry, the mango was very ripe, but the dressing was great, can really taste the zest of oranges.   Overall, didn't feel the staff there was welcoming nor happy?"}
{"text":"We popped in for the standard over-priced hotel breakfast.  The service was excellent especially trying to resolve the issue of bitter coffee.  Nicely handled.  The eggs Benedict had  nice runny yolks and a lemony hollandaise sauce.  The english muffins were nicely toasted and I enjoyed the potatoes.   The Canadian breakfast was as advertised, tasty maple sausage, eggs easy over were cooked to order and some nice whole wheat toast. Overall a good breakfast that both hit the spot and the pocket book."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the Delta Hotel in Meadowvale.  We went here as a group fo 5, and were seated within a few minutes, so right on time with our reservation.  What a great place as they pulled out all the stops for their special Mothers day dinner service.  From shirmp and Lobster, to lamb, roast beef, chicken, various pasta dishes, or veggies, salads etc.  So much i could not try it all.  Since this was a special occaision for mothers day i am not sure how they operate on a daily basis but this meal was amazing.  The bar was lined with various deserts so there was something for everyone.  The tables and seating were very comfortable and you are certainly not rushed.  The Chef came out at one point and stopped by each table, and we were very impressed at the warm sincerity from this gentleman who did such a fantastic job with his team.  This is what a festive occaision should be like and they certainly delivered.  I would love to go back again for their next special day and see what they come up with because this diner service would be a hard one to top.  We all left satisfied in every way.  Cant wait to go back.  And if my son is reading this then hint hint hint ***Fathers Day***hint hint hint"}
{"text":"As part of the wedding celebrations, Sunday was the day family were flying away and as most of them were at Hilton Meadowvale, the bride and groom did a brunch for the about 50 of us (not a typo).   The restaurant is beautifully designed and a special mention on how the mirrors are used on most places. And a special star to the staff at Quest. Fantastic service with smile and all special requests were met, and there were quite a few.   Now the food. Pretty standard fare - eggs, bread, meats, oatmeal, breads, cheese. The fruit mini bowls, grape tomato and bonnaccini cheese salad, fruit parfait were outstanding. The made to order omelettes are to be ordered with the staff rather than somebody making them in front of you. The coffee a little weak for our taste.   But a nice spot."}
{"text":"For hotel food, it's pretty good.  Quest is located in the Hilton hotel (used to be a Delta, recently rebranded) and is bigger than it looks from the lobby. There's a giant wraparound bar and a fair amount of tables in the back.   Each day there is a different beer and wine special which is pretty cool. I didn't think that the prices were all that bad for a hotel - 9oz wine pours were in the CN$11-12 range (the strong US dollar really makes that a bargain). Menu-wise, it's pretty basic choices but my dish was well seasoned and better than I'd expect for something in a hotel.  Service was good too, especially considering they were completely full with folks watching the final Jays vs Texas baseball game.  If you're staying in the Hilton, this really is not a bad choice for dinner or drinks."}
{"text":"Flight from Vancouver to Toronto delayed twice, ate snacks I brought onto the plane with me, sat in the plane for five hours...arrived to Pearson airport at around 10:30 pm, checked into the hotel at around 11:15 pm and was HUNGRY. Luckily, this restaurant was opened (inside the Delta Meadowvale Hotel); company I work for would foot the bill for my meal as I was on a business trip.  Tired and hungry (those times you don't know whether to eat or sleep first), I ordered a stir-fry dish (I can't remember the name of the dish but it had rice, vegetables - lots of mushrooms plus shrimp). I asked the waitress if the dish was gluten free and she said it indeed was. I ordered a relaxing herbal tea on the side.  The meal was GREAT, beautifully presented with big carrot ribbons, bok choy and other veggies. It was a bit heavy on the soy sauce but I still enjoyed it. The service was friendly and attentive. Glad these guys were there for me when I need it."}
