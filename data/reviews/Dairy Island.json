{"text":"A nice variety of ice cream options for the family to choose from.  All of them very good!  The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it's pricey.  You can easily destroy a $20 bill there."}
{"text":"Before going into Chagrin Falls for ice cream try Dairy Island.   This is my most favorite ice cream place in the area!  They have so many choices and the Hurricane with peanut butter cup is my personal favorite.  If you order the Category 5 Hurricane you will have enough dessert to feed a family of five.   The food menu is great too.  If there is a long line of customers don't be concerned because the service is fast.  There are little rides for the kids and nice seating areas.  Oh yeah there is a mini golf course right next door too.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Head to Chagrin Falls for ice cream instead.   I ordered a cup.  The woman handed me a cone.  I told her I wanted it in a cup so she took a spoon and pushed the ice cream off the cone and into a cup. 

Half the fun of getting soft serve is the twirly tip.  But I just got a pile of mash.  

Pretty lame Cibiks."}
{"text":"My family went to Cibik's Dairy  Island last night for ice cream and the experience was second to none.They have multi flavors for dipping .They have the best Sundaes --I love the butterscotch dip. The owner Mr. Cibik is the nicest man and the staff are as sweet as the Custard --I highly recommend to everybody going to Dairy Island."}
{"text":"We loveeeee dairy island! I have been coming here for over 15 years and it just keeps getting better. Their fried ice cream with honey on top is my absolute favorite. The ice cream cone portions are good. We love the putt putt in the back! It's easy enough for my 4 year old daughter and it's cute! Great place to hang out in the summer!"}
{"text":"Beautiful large, lighted, vine covered pergola to sit under. So nice to have a local owned ice cream shop in our community."}
{"text":"I mean, it isn't a real trip to the movies without stopping by Dairy Island afterwards. Actually, what I just described is an essential experience of a Chagrin Falls child on their first date. As cute as that sounds, the ice cream soft serve isn't that good here... It's no East Coast that's for sure. Considering it's location and friendly appearance though, I foresee Dairy Island never closing and being a staple on East Washington for decades to come."}
{"text":"Dairy Island is my favourite summertime spot! Between the corndogs....onion rings...turtle sundaes...dips Dairy Island is a family-owned  establishment with a classic putt-putt course behind them. Try making your own ice cream creation to win bragging rights and an addition to the menu. They now accept credit cards which is amazing! Hands down a local treasure!"}
{"text":"I have family who live in Bainbridge, and every time we come to visit them, Dairy Island is a must stop! I love the custard with the crunchy topping; I've yet to find anything like it at any other ice cream shop I've visited around the country. I have also tried a few of their sundaes, and my favorite is the Death by Reese's Cup, which is exactly what it sounds like. It's glorious. 
I haven't had any of the actual food, but it always smells so yummy! 
When it comes to simple and delicious ice cream, Dairy Island is the place to go!"}
