{"text":"So this is pretty bias because it's based on 2 macaroons...   I just happened to walk by (while furniture shopping on King) and I saw that they had coffee and macaroons.  My bf didn't feel like getting anything, and since we were supposed to be seriously furniture shopping, I decided to just 2 macaroons to go.  I got a black forest and lavender.  I couldn't wait to try them, so as I was walking out, I took a bite out of the blackforest one.  It was hard, but the flavours were great.   There were actual cherries inside.    After walking around for a bit, I decided to finished the lavender one as well.  I realized that they might freeze their macaroons to keep them fresh.  The lavender one was defrosted, and had a good crunch on the outside, and chewy, soft centre. It was very very lavender-ish.  If you don't like the flavour of lavender, do not get it.  I don't mind it, because the cream in the middle helped to balance it out.   I've been meaning to go back to get the black forest one again and eat it right this time.  Also to try the other macaroons as well.    I'd say this was a happy accident=) Must try!!!"}

{"text":"I'm currently in this addiction to macaroons phase and been spending my time trying different bakeries. Anyways, this one was feinately my favourite place. The macaroons were just the perfect texture and crunchy ness, they also have very unique flavours such as cookies and cream, raspberry cheese cake etc. I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"With every intention of trying Hank's, I passed by Petite Thuet and decided to stop in since it's been a bookmark of mine here for a while.   The food cases had tonnes of delicious looking pastries, salads and sandwiches. I couldn't decide between the Lobster Salad sandwich or the chicken pesto panini. I asked the chef and he said the lobster salad is made with fresh Nova Scotia lobster and crab -- in other words, no \"krab with a k\"! It's mixed with a spicy mayo and is served on a pretzel roll. Delish!  It was $9 which I thought was high for a sand, but I guess it's the price you pay for lobster. I couldn't resist ordering a pastry -- I mean, it's a french pastry shop after all! -- and ordered a cafe au lait and the opera cake. Both were very, very good, and I believe they told me that everything is made in-house. They had macarons, but I'll have to make a second trip back to try those!  The staff was friendly enough, but were a little arrogant, imo. The shop is small, but has enough seating, and they have plasma TVs if you can't stand being away from CP24 for more than 30 mins."}
{"text":"I've come to this place a couple of times for a croissant and an espresso. The croissant was tender and flaky and the espresso was velvety. I've also bought their lemon tarts, which have an elaborate meringue topping and have exactly the right balance of zest and sweetness. I was less fortunate with their sourdough baguette, which was rock solid and dry, I can't help wondering if I was given a day-old loaf."}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter was super friendly.  Dare I say flirty?  Hopefully so, since I was flirting.  And it's an embarrassment when you are flirting alone.  Ahem!  Errr....awkward situation aside....  Petite Thuet is not bad, but it's not perfect either.  I give it a wholehearted \"meh\".  I purchased four macarons at $1.95 each in pistachio, strawberries & cream, lemon, and coffee.  No wait, hazelnut.  Caramel?  Well it's brown coloured....something?  Yeah, dude had no idea what the brown was.  It tasted like Tiramisu, so I'll stick with that.  The lemon was crusted with yellow sugar, which was totally uncalled for.  A macaron is sweet enough!  And one out of the four macarons wasn't too fresh. A-okay, but I won't be making a trip back anytime soon.  Not even for the dude's phone number."}
{"text":"The picture of their inside makes the shop looks big, but it is a pretty small shop. I live in the neighbourhood.  Their glass case I saw always looked good  and I tried macaron and coffee. They are nothing special and it is expensive. They do not have a bathroom for a customer."}
{"text":"This is the newest expansion of the Thuet empire and a welcome addition to the St. Lawrence Market neighborhood.  This is a small patisserie and opens early, I believe 7 am every day except Sunday.  The croissants are so fresh and everything, including the French macaroons,  are baked on site.  The clerk told me the bakers get in around 1 am to start with the baking.  Well done y'all, it's delish!  They have sandwiches, meats and cheeses in addition to the baked goods.  The espresso is also very good."}
{"text":"ok at the risk of being ridiculed by some I have to say that the only people on the planet who can make real high end cakes that linger in your mouth and wow you everytime you take a bite are French, I am not one but every important pastry chef in the world is French meaning he or she was born there. In todays world unfortunately people who haven't lived in Europe  and have not developed particular taste buds to really appreciate a good cake or food will never know. I judge a place by the chocolate cakes and trust me a looked for months before I found a bakery with a chef that knows what cakes should be like and that is Ma Maison in Etobicoke. Everybody else Thuet, Rahier might have one or two good items but the rest are average. Ingredients need to be a certain kind, butter one of the most important ingredients should be from Switzerland or France not Niagara. there is a huge difference like with wine. Now people who think ON wine is good because they won an award should ask how many of those bottles were made, and they were made for a competition most of the time. So sadly Thuet sucks  tried the meringue which is another basic but important item to measure by was horrible. so bad that I threw it in the garbage while I was walking home. Most people have no idea so they cannot know, but the macarons specially the chocolate ones were bad, they covered the mess they put inside with sugar. when you taste it after swallowing it look for the chocolate flavor you wont find just plain sugar and cheap butter. well I guess this is how it is in North America with regards to cakes. the French place on Yonge and Yorkville on the corner should be shut down. In France this place would not survive a week, very very bad but I admit looks good. I guess these fake chefs will make a good living on the back of people who just don't know......well there are worse things in life i guess...............most of them have good bread i guess..........."}
{"text":"I generally like Petit Thuet and visit them quite frequently.  Their pastries are quite good although not the best in Toronto.  I often have their turkey sandwiches which are very good.  Unfortunately, the one I bought there today was made with regular deli slices in place of the freshly baked turkey usually used.  Hopefully this was just a bad day in the life of Petit Thuet and we won't be seeing regular deli slices in their sandwiches ever again."}
{"text":"Because I eat so much sugar in general and a lot of macarons, a friend brought a few from this store for us to try.   - SIZE: smaller and thicker (meringue shells) than the other ones we've had, it's neither good nor bad, just different   - SHELLS: of the four flavours that are available on that day, two were done quite perfectly with crispy outer shell and chewy interior, the other two were unforturnately cakey especially towards bottom of each shell where ganache fillings touch, they were almost gluey.   - FILLINGS: caramel sea salt is our favourite, it had a perfect balance of sweetness and umami; Pistachio cream has a nice flavour but too sweet; raspberry filling tasted more like a jam vs. macaron ganache; PB&J had too much flavours going on and overwhelmed the delicate meringue taste   I'd go back and try other stuff and more macarons."}
{"text":"I don't quite understand the business model of this place.  This is close to my home and on my way to work.  So I could have spent lots of $ passing by here IF... 1) The service was great?  Each time that I have passed by, the people come from the back, unfriendly, confused and did not want to be bothered by a customer.  Are you selling stuff or what?  They never carry cash early in the morning so I have to do debit.  I understand that they are baking in the back but have a presentable store front to induce people to come.   2) The display was well laid out? They have one tall shelf of bread and a few baskets of croissants with no signs.  Make a little effort why don't you?  Add some flowers or charm to the place.  You have potential to grab so many people but there is just no effort.   It makes me sad because the croissants are quite good but are expensive.  So I am not motivated to go here despite all of that.  Why should I if they are not making any effort?     The other location makes more sense and the service is friendlier so why don't we get that on this location?  Please?"}
{"text":"Their espresso is the best in a neighbourhood which is severely lacking good coffee shops.  Both staff I have encountered here have been very friendly and have remembered my order after only going in a handful of times."}
{"text":"Warning, This Review is strongly biased. A four star only based on 1 coffee 1 donut.  I was picking up croissants across the street and I saw this. The name looks so familiar so I just cross the street \"unconsciously\". ( See the trick to cut the weekend spending? is you just don't look around!)   Later I found out it was the same store on King, with more bakery. Almond Croissant looks as tempting as the one i had in my bag.  I told the gentleman behind the counter that I had a croissant already and ask him if he could recommend something else (meanwhile my hand already reaching to the bag of Madeleine cake on the counter.) He suggest the donut like thing in the plate. it says it is so much more than just a fried donut. So i got that one.   How I am gonna describe that thing. It is just GOOD. Not too sweet, a little bit chewy, in a good way. With coffee, it is like a plain and comfortable kind of tasty. Good way to start a Sunday, a little bit pricy way as well ( $3 for the donut)   I am looking forward to try the jam and ketchup and the duck confit next time."}
{"text":"Although.. I ordered a almond Croissant but end up getting a plain one... but..it was a great plain Croissant !   More like a 3.5 place to me ~"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Walked by to get deserts today for a dinner we were attending, the selection looked great but the pastries were disgusting. I ordered a lemon meringue tart and a raspberry macaroon, both tasted like they had been stored in a fridge or freezer too long (or in a ziplock bag). For the prices they charge and the reputation of chef Marc Thuet, I expected much more."}
{"text":"I've already written a review of Petite Thuet for the 1 King West location (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/petite-thuet-toronto-3#hrid:WMRzBXIWyF-CFAz885evpg), complete with a glowing review of the Croque Monsieur (which I'm eating as I write) and this location has all the tastiness of the 1 King West Petite Thuet, with perhaps a littttle less variety (perhaps until they get more of a customer base) but all the essentials are here.   Macarons, Croque Monsieurs, coffee, croissants, decadent pastries and a large collection of jam and preserved goods. A smaller dining area but they're targeting a take-away crowd in this area (like me) and it works fine.   The best thing about this location? While the staff at the 1 King West location have always been great, the customers at best can be a bit snobby, making the experience a bit strenuous. At this location I've experienced nothing but fluffy good vibes, which is pretty much essential considering they are the first place I go before I head to work.   All the best and here's hoping my waistband doesn't expand...too much."}
{"text":"I go to this place a lot as its near my work.  PROS: Love the almond croissant at Petite Thuet. Tiny place but cozy - there are only around 5 tiny tables in this place. A good place to breakaway from your desk and enjoy a coffee with a croissant or a desert.   CONS: Price point - pricey for the portion and the size of the croissant / sandwich. Service is sometimes really slow depending on who is working at the cashier.  Despite the slow service during lunch time occasionally, I still go there just because they have the almond croissant. hmmmm... I normally try to go during off peak time to avoid the slow service."}
{"text":"I personally really liked the macarons with sprinkles on top, the other's taste and texture were fairly good, but not the best ones I've haf. The location of the shop had many comfortable seats and is a great setting for lunch. In addition, it was really convenient to find as it was right outside King Station. The packaging of the box was average however with a simple brown box."}
{"text":"Chef Mark Thuets (a previous 2 and 3* Michelin star experienced chef), is behind this little cozy Mary Poppins oasis of delights. What does that mean? Top notch. It feels like your in a tiny town in Europe when you pop in. Its rustic and has a European raw vibe in there (aka in the summer months brace yourself there is no air con but for what you get all is quickly forgiven).  The bread - Heavenly crafted. There is a reason why they are super busy with orders out in the morning to top hotels and restaurants ordering their bread for the day! My absolute favorite is the sour dough, which is apparently a family recipe handed down... and you can even ask for it to be sliced. Go early though to avoid disappointment, the secret of their bread den is out!   Their pastries and tarts etc. Popular is the word. Their croissants are oh so buttery.  Their artisanal array of delights in mason jars will keep you coming back to comb the shelves for the latest in season concoctions to devour.   Holidays - are a great time to put in an order for pumpkin pie or xmas delights including mulled wine, which by the way is divine!   The coffee shop - if you want peace and quiet and a more personalized place to stop, its a great little place.   The staff - have been hit and miss. They let one guy (a friend of one of their bakers and the ex shop assistant of the yonge st location) waaayyyy overstay his time there and it soured the whole customer journey, his computer gaming was more a priority than the filth and stack of dishes abound but I wont go on about it as mercifully he is finally gone though the owners chose to ignore the customer protestations for nearly a year!... to the point where the place became a ghost town, understandably. It was a very expensive miss-hire. They really need to ensure their staff work on shifts and not hunker down on their laptops in the back area - this sadly still happens even now.   The upside, the staff in situ now for the most part, appear to be trying to get on top and re-win the locals. I for one, am one of them. For their sake I hope they do, its a wonderful offering and a treat to have in the area.   Petit Thuet is definitely worth a try!  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Thuet"}
{"text":"I guess I've experienced better because there are no customer bathrooms.  This is a tiny place. Nice bagged teas. Limited pastries. A chatty barista who was flirting with a Mac girl the day I arrived. But you can sit by the window and watch the world go by. Read your book. Uninterrupted."}
{"text":"I have a petite problème with Petite Thuet.   The insides are quaint and inviting. The walls are a deep red and they have a beautiful wood slab bar against the window. A wide assortment of jars are on display. BUT. It's unlikely I'll ever order a croissant from here again.   Came in on a Saturday afternoon (it was empty and a \"Be back in 5 minutes\" note was on the counter.) Another patron and I waited together a few mins until a staff member came out from the back to let me pay for my pastry. As for the croissant selection, they have plain, pain au chocolat, almond and her personal recommendation, chocolate almond.   I ordered one of the chocolate almond variety, which set me back $3.50. The outside of the pastry was promising, looking flaky and delicious. But on first bite, it was disappointingly dry. Mine in particular had only a few chocolate pieces and a pitiful amount of almond paste. The crunch was its only saving grace. In any case, bad croissants are still croissants, so.  I helped make macarons at Petite Thuet ~5 years ago for a pastry chef friend and they were delicious, so my fond memories won't allow me to shun this place completely. I also remember they used to hire ex-cons to give them a chance to learn new skills, so that's also a plus, but I'm not sure if they're still there."}
{"text":"Macarons were just okay for how teeny and expensive the were. One flavor was just NASTY.  Candy apple? What in the world!? It tasted like feet. The service was odd.  I called a few days in advance to order a couple dozen macarons and I got the man I spoke with's name.  I came in the day we discussed to get the macarons and he had no recollection of our phone call.  Luckily the macarons were in stock. Though the macarons, seating area, and service let me down their hazelnut cake was SO yummy.  A perfect dessert in both flavor and texture."}
{"text":"Don't bother. They didn't have macarons for Macaron Day. Told me that they will have some in 45 minutes, so I returned an hour later to get the same answer- they will be delivered in 30-45 minutes. I said, isn't that what you said an hour ago? Then I got a reply that the delivery will be here when it will be here. Well I'm certainly not coming back for a third time just to get disappointed. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"For a tiny place in Summerhill, you would think this is a great place to visit. Food is ok, drinks not bad ... attitude of server? Terrible!   It's a nice sunny spring Saturday morning, how about a little smile?"}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews, I was expecting so much more from the croissants here. They're ok but not great. If you're in the College/Bathurst area, you can pay less for a better one at Manic Coffee."}
{"text":"Went here today after seeing this review. Nice little set up. I agree with the Chowhound reviews though, the macaron's are inconsistent in size, and already started crumbling before I bought them.  At 1.85 per macaron, not really a bargain. But they did have a  variety of flavors, no mango this time. Pistachio, Chocolate, Sweet Caramel, Vanilla, Lemon and Strawberry."}
{"text":"Although I do agree with other reviews here that the appearance of this bakery is in shambles, I cannot agree about the staff. When I walked in there was an older women behind the cash. She greeted me warmly with a big smile. She got my order right and seem truly grateful for my 2 dollar tip. I bought a plain and almond croissant as well as a blueberry Danish and they were all amazing, especially the almond croissant. I do wish there was some sort of menu board thou. I was unsure of what they had there and just bought what was in front of me. I would of gladly spent more money."}
{"text":"I am rating Petite Thuet based on their macarons... so this maybe a little bias.  The choice here is not many as other bakery I went to but gee I still have problem decide which one to get! Life will be so easy if I can just tell the nice gentleman behind the counter to just give me one each.(not only it is not good for my wallet, not good for my health and if I ate those all in one shot I will definitely drive my food crawl buddy crazy!)  Pumpkin which is the seasonal flavour has this rich pumpkin taste. Hazelnut is good too... just have a hint of sweetness but with great nutty flavour. BTW, they are not as sweet as a lot of the other places I have. I found that is much better since the flavour will be more intense then just sweet sweet sweet.  The size is a little smaller but they are at $1.95 a pop! Also one of the cheaper macarons I have.  Petite Thuet also sell jar of French soups, packaged cold cuts and duck confit where you can buy and reheat or cook in your own kitchen and impress your friends and guests!"}
{"text":"Great butter croissants! Fresh and flaky! Service was also phenomenal. They take cash only so be prepared. Looks like an industrial kitchen but just walk in and they'll serve you with a smile!"}
{"text":"I keep reading about macarons on yelp talk so I decided to try it out to see what the big deal was. The macarons at this place rocked my socks!   I saw all the pretty colours and couldn't decide what to get so in a moment of confusion, I asked them for one of each flavour - which totalled nine. When I got home and bit into it, I finally understood why they were so pricy.  They're like little bits of heaven."}
{"text":"I have a thing for macaroons, so stumbling across Petit Thuet by chance is more like divine intervention. Hands down, they have the best, most authentic, most delicious, most perfect macaroons in north of Bloor.  They have a good selection of flavours so pick what you'd like.  It's definitely on the pricier side (it's in Rosedale, just across the street from the massive LCBO) but it's worth it. Petite Thuet is a gem...but I still really love Manischwitz canned macaroons and that will never change."}
{"text":"The macarons were larger than usual and the variety was great but the taste wasn't. In my opinion, it was WAY too sweet and it was too fragile for my liking. I got the l'eau rose, yuzu et chocolat and caramel et chocolat. The rose one shattered in the bag they put it in (it wasn't tossed around or anything) and I had to throw away the other two after one bite because I couldn't handle the sugar level. However, the employee (barista) was very kind and sweet.   (Wrote a blog post about this place with pictures! Check it out for a more elaborate opinion! http://food-indulgences.blogspot.ca/2014/12/macarons-again-petite-thuet-style.html)"}
{"text":"I don't understand the people on here complaining about the size of the macarons...are the macarons you normally buy the size of hamburgers?  Where are these giant macarons you speak of?  Do you think Nadege's are the size of chocolate chips, then?  Petite Thuet's are actually the largest I've come across.    That aside, I've only been to this location once so far, which is stupid because I live down the street.  I've been to the location on King several times.  /csb  I accidentally said 'macaroon', in a moment of self-conciousness - regarding my lack of a good French-accent.  I know that macarons and macaroons are different.  The gentleman behind the cash was quick to correct me, and I will never make the same mistake again!  I feel confident now to ask for a MACARON!  I FEEL ENLIGHTENED AND EMPOWERED.  I FEEL FULL OF SUGAR."}
{"text":"Went back to give it another go. It was still not the best. The macaroons look great but taste meh.  I love macaroons and have no idea why theirs taste so poor."}
