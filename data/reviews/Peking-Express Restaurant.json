{"text":"Best egg rolls I've ever had! Not the greatest part of town to dine in at, but everyone who works is friendly and kind."}
{"text":"I'm sorry for being so blunt but this place is subpar. There's nothing especial about this food and it lacks taste and everything else. I ate it only because my friend paid for it but I didn't even finish my food."}
{"text":"This place sucks there's nothing especial about it the food looked old as if they had used it the day before and on top of that I found a piece of hair on my freaking noodles disgusting. I'm just being honest."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Chinese food in my time and this is possibly the worst I've ever eaten. Peking Express didn't get a single star rating only because of the amount of food they give you. Huge."}
{"text":"This places is under new management.The old man used to own and cooked has retired and moved on selling his restaurant and the name it self used to be the best in town hands down.warning,,,!,, ppl. Don't be fool by the name that uses to be it's not the same trust me.. sad sad sad..... go if you like but warning,,, I told you so as well as others"}
{"text":"So hard to find good Chinese food, this place is a small hole in the wall but the food is uh-may-zing!! Coconut chicken and charsiu pork was the best and I don't even like coconut. Huge portions for cheap!"}
{"text":"Was my favorite place in town to eat.  Now that they have changed owners I do not like the food as much.  The old recipes were the best in town.  Always great sizes for a good price."}
{"text":"UNDER NEW OWNER.. this used to be one of the best Chinese fast food/togo restaurants in Vegas. Always fresh and  tasty. This place opened 20+ years ago, I have been going since I was a little girl. Sometimes traveling all the way across town. It wasn't until I ordered & picked it up that I learned there was new owners. My thoughts now!! Definitely not the same. I will not be going back. To say the least"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch, my first time at this restaurant. I love my ma and pa shops they are the best. For eighteen bucks and change I got two combos of orange chicken and Kong Pao Chicken with red peppers plus chow mein and 4 egg rolls.    Delicious smell the whole drive home. Both orange and kong pao was salty salty no spice what so ever. It didn't stop me I kept eating right away it I felt how heavy it was. It gave me a food coma. My brother had his share once he got home. He ate every last bite.   I don't want to give a bad review and feel I should give this restaurant a second chance."}
{"text":"Peking Express has been a place near my work that I'e known about for years but never patronized.  Today was the day that changed.  This small Chinese restaurant is located in a lower income neighborhood in a strip mall that doesn't have a lot of traffic.    The inside decor featured several articles and awards that aren't from sources that I am familiar with, and otherwise had a somewhat cafeteria feel to it.  Although the lunch specials were in the $5-6 range, I had the Country Pork ($7.50 with rice), and the Crab Rangoon ($4.99).  The Country Pork had it's own little picture taken on the counter so I thought that maybe the chef was proud of this particular dish.   The Country Pork wasn't bad. It was a stir fried dish with onions and bell peppers.  The pork was a tad tough and gristly, but not offensively so.  The herbs used were the same that you get in some authentic Mexican restaurants, along with some spicy Chinese flavor.  It was fairly unique and really not bad at all!  The portion was huge and could easily be shared with two people.    The Crab Rangoon wasn't bad.  They came with a generic store bought sweet and sour sauce.  Nothing to write home about.  Overall this place isn't bad for the neighborhood if you are looking for Chinese.  However, I probably won't be ditching the little Thai restaurant across the street for this place. ;)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. It's ready in a short amount of time. No complaints. It's my go to place for lunch. I'd recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced Chinese food. Spring rolls were excellent! Chow Mein very good. Not greasy like China A Gogo (yuck). Steamed rice was good. Everything pretty much average Chinese. If you want cheap good Chinese, this is your spot. Staff was friendly. For two people we spent $16.  Good taste- low price- yum."}
{"text":"simply the best chinese food in vegas? I would always go there for my meal. Their owner really knows how to make Chinese food right. :)"}
{"text":"Since I was in the area I decided to give this place a try. I was not impressed. Let's start with the sign on the door, regular white sheet of paper that someone used a Sharpie to write with announcing they're looking for a \"Balingual Cashier.\" When I asked the girl behind the counter if she knew the sign was misspelled, she recognized that it was but said something along the lines of not wanting to take it down. Oh, okay.   I looked over the menu board and picked out an order of Crab Rangoon and Spicy Almond Chicken. After paying $14.58 I proceeded to wait. That's when I noticed all the chairs were already on top of the tables. According to the sign on the door the place closes at 9 p.m. and it was 7:30. Why make it seem that they're closing shop so early and not give patrons a seat or even a seat for them to wait for their food?? I got a chair off the table and waited for my food. The place is pretty grimy.   Anyhow, got my food and came to the office to eat. Rangoon were cold and not good. I looked inside the little pockets to see if there was anything other than cream cheese and I just saw a speck here and there of something green and red which I maybe could assume was chive and imitation crab, but it sure didn't taste like it.   Now the Spicy Almond Chicken was very bland and no flavor to it. Definitely no spice was used, and I had to dump a packet of soy sauce to even make it taste like something.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with the food. And the portion size was amazing. It was hot , steamy delicious and a great bang for your buck. It was my 1st time trying it and will be diffently ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Please don't eat here. This place is always EMPTY. The one time my fiance and I decide to finally try it I left feeling like I needed to throw up and all we had was their \"Boba\". We didn't even get through half our drinks before we threw them away and walked out to go to Asian Garden (which is a 5 minute drive away on Stewart & Nellis) to have REAL Boba. It takes a lot for me to write a bad review for anything but I just couldn't let this go. Their strawberry watermelon slush tasted like old play-doh with WAY too much sugar and their milk thai tea tasted cheap and watered down. When the girl gave us our drinks the boba on the bottom of the cups were so hot you couldn't touch the cup on the bottom half and we spent like 5 minutes just trying to cool the entire drink down so it was drinkable. I've never had anything like that happen before, when you order a cold drink it should be cold when you get it! If we wouldn't have touched that area on the cups ahead of time we would have burned our mouths with the first sip. SERIOUSLY?!?!? This place is a joke. If you want real, quality Chinese food and Boba take the extra 5 minutes and go to Asian Garden right down the street and you will not be disappointed. We've been there more times then we can keep track of and have never had one problem (They often give us free appetizers when we order because we usually get so much food!)"}
{"text":"I have a 20+ yr history with this restaurant. I use to live in the area years ago and my mom and I came here often because the food was good, large portions and cheap.  Today was the first time I've been back in over 10yrs and still a good spot! Their prices are a bit more expensive but the portions are still large and food still yummy.  They also have a food hot line set up like panda express where you can pick and choose what you want in combo deals, which is nice and way more affordable than ordering off the regular menu but I wanted what I always ordered back in the day (which wasn't on the hot line)  The service was ok the guy was training a new girl and he seems a bit overwhelmed trying to train her when I walked in and a party of 3 guys walked in behind me. The seemed to be handling her business but the guy kept trying to take over. Lol   Combination fried rice $9.95 (no bean sprouts, no beef and extra portion of bbq pork) 4/5 stars.  The old school taste is still there but only 4 stars because they got way stingy with the shrimp only 3 in that entire thing but lots of pork and chicken.   Sesame chicken $9.95 4/5 stars  Crispy, flavorful, and tasty! Large portion"}
{"text":"This place sucks really bad. It's in the ghetto and has a cafeteria feel the place and the food. It's dingy I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I wish they had a picture of their shrimp dishes..like the shrimp fried rice..they put alot of plump hardy size shrimp in there!  The genorous portions are enough to take home and enjoy another day.  My recomendation is:  eggrolls..the pork fried rice..shrimp fried rice..they shrimp chop suey..beef and broccoli..sweet and sour pork..shrimp with vegetables...pot stickers...fied chicken wings...and everything everything on their menu!   I always drive across town..cuz China Town being around the corner of my house..does not have food like this..the have 2 restaurants now..please make like 10 more?   I still wish they would add my favorite dish:  Honey Garlic Chicken..noone has it in Vegas..plzzzzzz..i miss that from Miami."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today with my wife.....and I just don't get the negative reviews on this place.... food was BOMB and the styro was PACKED.....and the guy serving VERY NICE.....sweetening the deal when u buy 2 combo plates on Sundays you get one FREE....so my wife and I ended up with 3 styros JAMMED with bomb ass chinese food for $16....Sounds like some reviewers need to lighten up a bit....ITS A CHINESE RESTAURAUNT IN THE HOOD....NOT THE RITZ....LOL....You want good chinese and LOTS of it?...ignore the negative reviews and check this place out....My wife and I are fans and WILL be back when the urge for chinese food hits!"}
