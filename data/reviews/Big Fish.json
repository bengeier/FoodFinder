{"text":"I can't say enough good about this place. Oysters are always fresh and they bring in daily from both coasts. Go on a Monday and you'll get the two for one deal; that's 2 dozen for $30...wow!!! As a seafood lover it has become my favorite haunt for a great meal. My daughter (teenager ) loves their lobster poutine and I am in love with their blue crab claw butter lettuce salade with homemade butter milk dressing."}
{"text":"When i think of eating out in Calgary, Big Fish is all ways an option. Best Burger i have ever had is the lamb/lobster burger. Many, and i mean MANY, great nights of service and food has come from this gem. I have had inconsistent and i have had less then my expectations........ but i have had so many good experiences here and at the joining restaurant Open Range, that i must say \" i am drawn here like the eternal Moth to the Eternal light of lights\"   big fish is worth at least 3 tries, if you are not satisfied after 3, i will buy your meal at any other restaurant in the city of Calgary you want...... minus the alcohol bill and to go orders. Just message me with your 3 receipts ready in hand, and we will go for a meal and discuss how wrong you think I am..... Jerk!!!!!  Big fish makes a gourmet Shark ahhhhhhhHHHHH satisfied!!!!! x a million!"}
{"text":"The service was great.  We waited along time for a good . The food was plain and sides where bitter and spicy . The fish was very plain, Fish should at least taste like fish. Not impressed with the food that we tried was really excited to go here but had better sea food at red lobster honestly."}
{"text":"This is my second review for Big Fish to rate their brunch experience   This is our new go-to brunch place in Calgary. I am somewhat of a soft shell crab addict.... Their soft shell crab sandwich with boar bacon is my favorite thing to eat! Everytime we go there I try to order something new but I'm hooked on it. The crab is fried to perfection and the dressing on the sandwich is creamy and perfect. The salad dressing on the side salad adds a great seaweed flavor to the experience. My boyfriend gets different dishes each time and they're absolutely delicious. The French toast is savory and sweet. The fish skillet dishes are incredible as well.   it's rare to find a place that does breakfast and dinner so perfectly. We are never bored of the flavors there."}
{"text":"I've been to Big Fish a few times and I have yet to be disappointed. My spouse and I have come for the Monday oyster special, and loved the suggestions the server had for us as well as their explanations of the oysters.  We have also been for a full meal and everyone left satisfied. The platter is a great starter to share and a good way to try a few different types of fish. The arctic char dish is great, as is the pickerel. The wild salmon was yummy, but there are better dishes on the menu.  The service was satisfactory, but I wasn't blown away. But overall a great restaurant with great food and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you like raw oysters this is the place to go! I've been there twice recently. The first time I went for lunch. We started off with some raw oysters. They were very fresh and delicious!  For entrees both my dining companion and I had the wild rose ale battered walleye. Everything about the dish was delish, including the housemade ketchup for the fries and the gourmet coleslaw. The housemade ketchup was very addictive and normally I'm not even a ketchup fan.  The second time I went on a Monday night for their \"Oysters by the dozen - 2 for 1 special\". The oysters were absolutely amazing, especially for Calgary standards. That was such great value too, $30 for 2 dozen oysters. They were perfect with a glass of sauvignon blanc. We then finished off by sharing their appetizer platter of smoked oysters, cured salmon pate, trout jerky, smoked trout and smoked mackerel. It's been such a long time since I've been \"wowed\" by a restaurant in Calgary.  The service was excellent on both occasions. The server was knowledgeable and helpful. I'm looking forward to my next visit there."}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken which is was over cooked and very dry - the restaurant compensated by removing it from by bill. My husband had the salmon and lentils - the salmon was very dry and over cooked and the lentils although tasted good was cold. We wanted to have desert but were afraid since our meals were not good. We ended up at another restaurant for coffee and desert.  Would not recommend this restaurant and will not be returning anytime soon....."}
{"text":"Great little seafood restaurant, which is very difficult to find in Calgary.  Parking is a little tight, may have to go around the block a few times if spaces ran out at the back of the restaurant, but its all worth it.  The restaurant is cozy, and the waitress are friendly.  Food is always great, we've been there 4 times, and every time was good. I had a Manitoba Walleye dish last time and was delicious.  Highly recommended, especially with the limited choice of seafood restaurant in Calgary."}
{"text":"Not as good as the reviews. Overly pricy and food was dry and ok"}
{"text":"Great food! Everything is made with fresh ingredients and you really taste the difference! We've only been here once but will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a busy Friday night!  The servers were good (though they could have used maybe one more server), and the food was delicious.  I have a friend that is always a little difficult to serve (lactose intolerant, gluten sensitive), and the meal was prepared well for her.  At the table, we had the Arctic Char, the Walleye, Lobster Curry Butter Chicken, and the Ling Cod.  All of the fishes were prepared to perfection.   The ceiling is a little low,  so it's quite loud inside, and it's crowded, but it was a nice night out!"}
{"text":"Calgary's Edmonton Trail has a lot to offer, from Over Easy to Diner Deluxe, and now Big Fish. I was pretty excited for this night out with my girlfriend and her family because my experience with seafood in Calgary hasn't been too great. We made it for our reservations at 7 and right off the bat I had a good feeling about the place and it's great atmosphere. Our server, who's name eludes me, provided us with exceptional service. She knew the menu like the back of her hand and she displayed her expertise in seafood when answering the questions we had about the fresh fish on the nights menu.  If you're a wine drinker then it's good to note that they have free corkage on Wednesday nights, which we had taken advantage of. We started the night with a bucket of shrimp and a half dozen oysters. The shrimp and cocktail sauce was what you would expect and the oysters were surprisingly very small, but had a nice fresh taste from the green onions and ginger. As for the mains, we all decided on the Pistachio crusted Arctic Char with Sundried Olive truffle butter and Wild Mushroom Sage mashed. This entree was fantastic! The Arctic char was fresh and cooked to perfection. It was delicate and held in its juices. The olive truffle butter, which was spread on top of the fish, was packed with huge flavour and to top it off the portion size was amazing.  Will definitely be back to see what else Big Fish has to offer!  Make sure to make reservations as this place gets busy."}
{"text":"I've been there twice, and both times had the Seafood Pot Au Feu both times. Saffron broth was incredible with deep complex flavour. Half-price oyster Monday is a great treat too... some of the freshest oysters I've had in a land-locked prairie city.  Great atmosphere, cozy and comfy. Don't let the outside fool you."}
{"text":"I love Big Fish, the first time I ever went was for lunch and I was drawn to the deep fried soft shell crab sandwich with Boar Bacon, over time I learned to ask for less sauce. But My O My. So delicious!  I've also had the seafood pot au feu, brunch and the only available at lunch fish and chips.  I went with a girlfriend of mine for the Monday night 2 for 1 Oyster night. Where we each got a dozen, since I'm still letting Oysters \"grow on me\" I was willing to try all the varieties they had in that day. Not gonna lie, there were some that just didn't work for me, too salty, briny etc but then there's just one that taste just right.   We shared the sablefish hot pot with ponzu reduction. The rice and parsnips were alright but nothing special. The sablefish is truly the star of the show, perfectly done and presented in a heated cast iron dish, the fish was excellent.   Then followed that up with two desserts. The key lime tart and a orange creme caramel. Fantastic end to a meal.   The best part about this place and what makes me go back is the quality of seafood and the laid back awesomeness that is Big Fish."}
{"text":"I had a really mean fish craving last night. We could have picked any restaurant that had a fish dish on the menu but we picked Big Fish because it's all about fish. I easily made our reservations for four on OpenTable and one hour later we were seated and checking out the menu.  Big Fish isn't fancy but it's comfortable. As we sat there I began to feel relaxed; like I could stay all night (the bottle of Pouilly Fumé probably helped with that!) We all really enjoyed the blues and roots music that played throughout the night and found the server to be friendly and attentive without being obtrusive. We started with the evening's baked oysters with boar bacon and cambozola sauce. They were nice, but just slightly warmed. I'm not sure if they were supposed to be hotter than that. Then we had a bucket of peel and eat shrimp to share. It was a really great start to the evening and everyone had their hands in the bucket at one point.  I ordered the evening's special fish; New Zealand Gurnard with a lovely citrus and green peppercorn sauce. It came with great garlic mashed potatoes, green beans, and broccolini. The sauce was spot on and complemented the well cooked fish perfectly. My husband had the pistachio crusted Arctic Char with sundried olive truffle butter. Again, the dish was well cooked and he really enjoyed it.  My son was a bit sad they didn't have fish and chips on the dinner menu and he's insisting that we return for lunch someday very soon (no complaints here!) so that he can order it. He did order the Manitoba Walleye which led us to a discussion about how Walleye is also Pickerel where we come from...and how Jackfish is called Northern Pike. Always good to do some learning when you are out and about! Our daughter was delighted with her seared Albacore Tuna salad with potatoes and beets. We just couldn't get enough of the great food! Though we didn't need to we ordered two slices of that amazing Bourbon Pecan Pie to share as well as a Lemon Shortbread tart for hubby. We didn't have any coffee though I did notice they have an espresso machine in the kitchen.  I'm certainly jealous that this neighbourhood has such a special place to eat..for a moment there I almost considered moving up North just to be closer! Our experience and food were definitely worth the five star rating in my books."}
{"text":"The dishes were excellent, the atmosphere was great, the service impeccable.   The food had the great combination of feeling fresh and home made yet sophisticated enough for a dining-out experience.  We ordered the cheese dip appetizer, two of us ordered fish and chips, and one ordered fish tacos. Everything was great and on point. For desert, the pecan pie was perfect.   I am not from Calgary, but will definitely go back there again when I visit."}
{"text":"I frequent this great little place with customers for lunch and have yet to be disapointed. The food is great, trout burger, soft shell, crab sandwich, and on, all with wonderful tasting sauces and sides. The oysters are great and yes they have my fav, Wild Rose Brown on tap. Service is always good and friendly. Customers often comment on waht a great choice. Have yet to check it out for dinner. In the summer a nice little patio to enjoy a cold WRB :)  Worth a visit, for some of the best seafood in Calgary."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Only thing I would change about this place is their hours, it's often closed when I want to go."}
{"text":"My friends and I made dinner reservations (highly recommended), and we were sat down immediately when we got there.  The mood and atmosphere of the restaurant was dark, romanctic, quiet and ambient, with mostly candlelights lighting up the room.  Our waitress was very professional, a little too formal in my opinion as she kinda showed a lack of personality.  Good selection of alcohol, and menu can be seen online prior to going to the restaurant (which some of my friends did), so you can have an idea of what you want to eat.  The Oysters were amazing!!!!  Cannot go wrong with that, and the Shrimp and Asparagus Lasagna with truffle was killer! My other friends had the Surf and turf in which you and combo your dishes, and another had the mussles.  Overall, great food, a little bit on the pricier side in my opinion, but I came out satisfied."}
{"text":"Not sure why it took me so long to try this place, it was amazing! Great, fresh seafood, good service and a fun diner atmosphere. One of the few places in the city that has soft shell crab. A must try for any seafood lover!"}
{"text":"The mussels are amazing! Order extra bread for the sauce and thank me later. The bison burger was also delish. One of our top 5 places for brunch and dinner in calgary."}
{"text":"I love the relaxed atmosphere of this restaurant. It's a great place to have a few bottles of great wine over a wonderful meal. The oysters were great, and the arctic char fantastic. And the wait staff are actually friendly, and willing to just let you enjoy yourself without driving you crazy every 5 minutes. I would say the restaurant could do with more comfortable chairs but maybe most people don't stay for three/four hours. We had no problems with the music or noise but we went on a weeknight. Anyways, it's a great night out."}
{"text":"GREAT mussels & pecan pie.  Well below average clam chowder...it was more like creamy potato soup for $9.  We also had the chicken & lobster curry.  There was only, without any exaggeration a half an ounce of lobster and the chicken breast was waaay over cooked.  If it hadn't been for Valerie and our server we probably would've asked to have the chicken & lobster curry taken off our bill.  We did tell the bartender that there was only one little piece of lobster and he blew us off saying there is always 3-4 ounces in each.  Not the case with ours.  The highlight of the night really was Valerie and our server/bartender who both recommended the mussels & pie.  We weren't impressed being blown off by the bartender about our concern but he's a decent guy for sure. We sat at the bar."}
{"text":"I was looking for a light breakfast / brunch so I ordered the scrambled eggs and local chicken sausage and some orange juice.  It came with two pieces of toast, some jam and breakfast hash. It was all delicious and very filling. So much for the light breakfast.  The whole thing came down to $15 including GST. The service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Arrived here at 8pm on a Saturday night to be seated at a lovely table by the window. We chose to have a cocktail and appetizer each to start our meal, and that's where the trouble began. Our waitress gave us a weird smile when we finished making each of our orders (to the point where I thought maybe I had ordered something funny?) and messed up our appetizer order so we didn't even get our second appetizer until about 20 minutes after the first one arrived. That ill-fated second appetizer was the frog's legs, the most hyped appy on Yelp, and it lived up to the \"fried\" part of the name as it was without a doubt the greasiest 5 bites of food we'd ever eaten. Nasty.  We ate all but one of the frog's legs and let the remaining leg be cleared with our dishes - or so we thought. A few moments after we'd sent it away, the waitress brought our last frog's leg back, looking somewhat worse for wear, to declare to us that there was \"one left!!\" We turned it down (for the second time) and let her take it away for real this time. Shocking - not since I moved out of my parents house have I had someone bring food back to the table to try to insist that I finish it!  We then attempted to order our entrees although it took a few tries to flag down the weird smiling waitress again. I ordered the soba noodle salad and my partner ordered the butter chicken and lobster hot pot. The soba noodle salad ended up being a huge bowl of spring mix (the same kind you buy at Safeway) with about a cup of cooked, clumpy soba noodles stirred into it, 4 slices of cucumber, and 4 grilled shrimp. That's it, no other vegetables, just spring mix and a few noodles for the low price of $14.   The butter chicken and lobster hot pot turned out to be one overcooked lobster claw (\"rubbery\" said my partner), one overcooked, bone-in (!) chicken breast (\"tastes like dust\" said my partner) in a vaguely spicy brownish stew with a few limp pieces of cauliflower floating in it. When was the last time you saw cauliflower in butter chicken? Me neither.  The waitress was nice enough to take the soba salad off the tab even though I didn't make a complaint about it (maybe I just misread the menu?!).   Overall: Slow, inattentive, error-prone service, bizarre decor reminiscent of someone's basement who thought they'd make a half-hearted attempt to do a \"sea shanty\" theme, and miserable food. We live only a few blocks away but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Big Phish always delivers the goods. Bowl of chowdah on a cold winter night always hits the spot. Their mussels are dish deelish too. Have yet to experience a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I happen to visit this place recently with a friend of mine.  I grew up on the coast so fish is quintessential to me.  This place got a nice retroish decor to it. To top that very good service and we were well looked after by the waiter and the hostess. We ordered frog legs and tacos for our apps, the fish was cooked to perfection and you can't go wrong with their fish taco. Frog legs were good, but I have had better ones.  We ordered Salmon, Lamb and Lobster burger for main course. The burger was really good, we both enjoyed them unfortunately, lobster could not stand out against the bold lamb. It came with side of pomme frites and a lovely salad. I had high expectation for the Salmon, but they crushed my heart with that. It was way overcooked and under seasoned the saving grace was from the lentil side dish.   To sum up, nice ambiance, excellent service, good appetizers and overpriced entrees."}
{"text":"Best seafood I've had in Calgary.  A misunderstanding with my order didn't change the fact that the dishes are simple, well executed, and delicious.  First, the green curry muscles were a great take on a classic steamed muscle appetizer.  The seafood strudel was out of this world and the seared char on potato o gratin was great comfort food.  I'd go back here in an instant, especially on free corkage night when one can direct their $$$ towards the great food and still enjoy a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Brunch is fantastic, great spot, good food, good coffee"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. The ambiance is comfortable and relaxed. I began my sojourn under the sea with an oyster that was quite small, Im sure that had I ever finished my degree in Oyster anthropology I would have known that the type I ordered was supposed to be small. He was jam packed with slimy goodness so his sacrifice was not in vain. I continued my purge of the sea with some frog legs, much like chicken wings but with a thigh and a calf muscle, followed closely by Manitoba Walleye on some mashed potatoes.  All in all, my protein levels, omega 3 fatty acids and blood mercury content went through the roof....so did my visa bill.  Big fish is highly recommended for service, food and ambiance....Warning that I paid 150 for 2 of us."}
{"text":"So i was watching the food channel and up comes \"You Gotta Eat Here!\" And i was bored and started watching.  Big Fish was the restaurant the guy was at and the food on the show looked amazing. When i heard it was right here in Calgary, i felt i really needed to go try it out. He said it was definitely somewhere you should try. I was a little bit skeptical at first, as i always am about these kind of shows. but boy oh boy. I ordered the salmon and it was just amazing. One spoon full of that sauce sent me on a journey. You could hear the \"mm's\" and \"oh man's\" from my entire table as everyone took their first bite.  Want my opinion? Come here at least once. It's quite pricey but oh so worth it. The atmosphere is great, the service is great. I'm not a fan of oysters but if you are my family says they were the best they've ever had.  -C.Wong"}
{"text":"Big Fish is one of my long time favourite neighbourhood restaurants. Even since moving out of the area I keep coming back. Service is consistently awesome and of course the food is delicious. For sure the best mussels I have ever had anywhere.... I order them every single time!!"}
{"text":"Edmonton Trail keeps knocking me out of the park each time I try and place here. There's Cerezo, OEB, Diners Deluxe, and Open Range.  I hopelessly tried to hit up OEB for lunch, but to no avail. OEB is always ridiculously busy. I want to get in on the hype, but I'm not going to wait an hour or more to try.  I made the walk of shame up the road to try somewhere different and I bump into Big Fish.  The inside of the place does not match the drab street of Edmonton Trail. I love the feel of this restaurant.  I had their soft shell crab, and it was delicious. I was eyeing many of their lunch entrees, which means I'll be back.  If you're feeling a nice seafood meal, Big Fish is your place to go."}
{"text":"The best seafood in the city!  Being this far from the ocean makes it hard to find decent - FRESH - seafood.   This understated restaurant is my favourite.  It is across town from where we are, but it is worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is just just beyond yummi food and great service! The oysters and the chowder are outstanding! Great wine selection, not in quantity but in quality!"}
{"text":"Was in Calgary for business and had a lot of time to spare waiting for my flight home. I prearranged to meet with my niece and her husband for dinner and they took me here. It was sort of funny because they comply with the Vancouver Aquarium sustainable seafood program ... I'm from Vancouver eating seafood in a Calgary restaurant that refers to Vancouver. Okay, maybe not that funny ... So to the food. We started with the crab cakes and they were thick and had a nice aioli sauce and small marinated salad. Then, based on the recommendation of my niece's husband, I had the lobster topped lamb burger - of course I order a lamb burger in a seafood restaurant (he had the seafood pot - looked good too - which is typically a dish that I like to get when available at a restaurant). They loaded up the lobster and the burger was thick and juicy. It was delicious. I am not sure if the lobster really added anything to the burger, but I'm not going to complain. The service was great too - good choice by my niece. By the way, my niece had the mussel appetizer as her main course - it looked good too."}
{"text":"Painfully slow service. So far I have been waiting 35 min for my meal. Better be great. The place has maybe 12 total customers. Bar is dead. Finally an apology at the 42 min mark. Ready to walk. I was so looking forward to this place after reading the reviews. Okay, finally got my food and it was tasty but not anazing. Now I'm just waiting for a check, and waiting, and....... I don't want to trash the place. I just hope you have a better experience. Total time for me 1 hour and 20 min."}
{"text":"Big Fish serves surprisingly good breakfast, and is one of the few places along Edmonton Trail that isn't lined up out the door on a weekend morning - yay!   As far as dinner goes, the oysters are GREAT (tried the east coast variety), though the rest leaves something to be desired. We tried the paella special on a Sunday, and while I was a LOT of food, is was mostly rice. The 'fixins' in the paella were paltry, and for the price there certainly could have been more to it.  We also tried the frog legs, which I can now check off my culinary bucket list, but likely won't order again from here.   We'll likely go back - definitely for breakfast as well as oysters, but might stop there."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the obscure facade! This place is absolutely amazing! Super fresh oysters for a restaurant so inland. I would probably order their lamb and lobster burger as my last meal on Earth. Atmosphere is cozy and casual for a place that serves such exquisite food. My wife is in love with their crab and butter lettuce with spicy sprouts salad with grape fruit dressing. Their butter chicken and lobster curry is also epic! Definitely my favorite restaurant in Calgary."}
{"text":"Big Fish knocks it outta the park for Brunch!  I've decided that going out to eat in large groups is a great idea! This morning a group of friends and I met for Brunch at Big Fish. I have consistently had some of my best meals at Big Fish for supper (don't tell my mother) and now I can add Brunch to that list. The benefit of eating out in groups was that I got to try three different dishes. The steel head trout was so good, and you know a restaurant knows what they're doing when they ask how you want your poached eggs cooked. To my left my friend had a very delicious plate of french toast that I got to try. I settled on the duck confit omelet and I can honestly say that across the board, our table was raving about their amazing confit hashbrowns. My duck was really good, the omelet was delicious and I really enjoyed my meal. Our coffee's were bottomless, and we never had to wait for a refill. I love going out to eat for a meal that I wouldn't normally make at home, and I know that the six of us will definitely be back for brunch again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service and really friendly staff. Oysters are delicious. Had the fried frog legs. Definitely will go back"}
{"text":"I grabbed a soft shell crab sandwich with BACON!  Say it again!  BACON!  Soft shell crab is a weird experience...it's good, don't get my wrong, but then you take a bite and you suddenly taste crude ocean, then the next bite is again euphoric.  Either way, great service, great food, and I give this a touch myself rating."}
{"text":"New to Calgary, for sure new to Big Fish. We live very close by to this eatery and some friends suggested that we go there this evening. Our friends are Calgarians and it was also their first time at Big Fish!  We all ordered drinks, had fantastic food and many laughs.  Service while sluggish at times, was good, the overall feel and dress, casual. No pretentiousness here. The restaurant was clean but HOT, no A/C and tonight, it needed it. The place was busy - reservations advised. Our party of 4 ordered as mains; Mussels Arctic Char Halibut Pot Au Feu Our party also devoured 3 desserts - ours was the only one we focused on, the key lime pie. Not bad, I have had better. Overall there were no real complaints about our meals and they were served in a timely enough fashion. My halibut was cooked very nicely - if I could make one comment it would be that my mashed potatoes could have been warmer. I would order it again in a heartbeat.The men had beer and us gals were able to choose from a wide variety of martinis. We had a very enjoyable evening and was not hard at all on the wallets. $88 for 2 people (our bill) that included 2 drinks each, an entree and shared dessert.YUMMY! We shall return! Thanks Big Fish!!!!"}
{"text":"OMGosh! Best meal Evah!  It doesn't look like much from the outside - there is a much bigger restaurant next door, but this is a GEM of seafood.  Yes I know we are in a landlocked area, but an International Airport is within 10 km!  When I was there, they were celebrating New Zealand week - which is where they fly in seafood from New Zealand and/or prepare dishes from the local.  The week following was Portuguese week (I think).  We had Christina as our server.  She provided a very interesting element to our meal - a bit like a Chessire Cat.  Her constant smile was friendly, yet somewhat disturbing.  She provided excellent recommendations and I think was amused by our silliness.  We started with Oysters - again the airport provides a gateway to PEI and another bay in BC that we enjoyed oysters from.  Uniquely, Big Fish serves three sauces in little squeeze bottles.  Good oysters don't need to be hidden by spicy sauce or vinegars!  Based on other Yelpers' advice, I had the pistachio crushed artic char.  I don't know if it is available all of the year, but if it is, try this fish.  It was fresh, flavorful and the best char I have ever had (artic char is a bit like salmon, but better)  When we arrived, which was before 6pm, the place was a bit empty, but by the time we finished, it was packed - on a Wednesday!  When you go, ask for Christine and smile at her.  Oh, and thank her for saving my grey jacket, which I left there accidentally!"}
{"text":"The good...  A. Table service was perfect, well-timed, attentive as needed and very friendly.  Cocktails and appetizers are served in a timely fashion given the expected slower service for the main course.  This was prefaced on their web site that they have a small kitchen and require time for cooking, so we were willing to chill out. In the end, the wait was really not all that long.  We finished 3 courses after 2 hours, which is very standard and paced well.  B. The food was definitley contemporary, gourmet, bistro food that was well seasoned, and well cooked given that almost all of their dishes are seafood.  They have a knack for cooking seafood well!  The grouper main was perfectly cooked and the mussels were also cooked perfectly. Portions were definitely good and sufficient! Try their maple bourbon pecan and praline pie, it's fantastic!  C. Great ambience and quaint for a small, simple setup.  The place is warm and welcoming the moment you walk in, giving it a great vibe.  The bar is the main attraction and makes you gravitate to it.  The decor is simple with a subtle appreciation for artwork. Although my husband felt it could use a bit of an update, I liked it for what it is: a casual clean-cut bistro.  D. The menu is small and targeted, offering easy choices.  I particularly loved the New Zealand Fish Week  Menu, which seems to be a menu that changes to offer more variety to customers.   E.  It is clean and tidy in the dining room and restrooms.     The bad...  A. The prices are a little high for some of their dishes. The scallop appetizer was very small (2 scallops on pea puree and garnish), and more like a taster instead of a proper sized starter.  Although it was certainly tasty, I felt the value was more like $8 given the small portion, not $15. A scallop dish at the Fairmont Rimrock is $17 for 4 jumbo scallops on a bed of risotto,  so I think pricing should be evaluated a bit.  The grouper main was very good, excellent in fact... but the type of fish it is, with 3 mussels on the plate and a bed of quinoa and vegetables, I would say it is more like $27/28, instead of $34.    B.  The hostess is a bit stiff with her personality. Although she appears to be very efficient, she needs to work on being more warm to guests at the front of the house.   The ugly...  D.  The note on Opentable.com is a little off-putting, stating that they need to have 2 seatings for specific days and times and that I need to be considerate of this.  The tone of this note is strong; I'm not sure how well received this is with other customers when making reservations on Opentable at Big Fish, but at the time, it made me think 3 times of whether or not I should dine here since I booked on one of these specified days and times.  I hope they remove this message; it's not inviting to customers. Morever, it's not a fair responsibility to the customer when the pace of dining should be managed by the restaurant without offending their patrons.   Final word...  Overall, I would definitely go back for more. I love seafood and cook a lot of it myself; I know bad seafood when I eat it.  This restaurant does it right.  Many other reviews I see on Yelp here seem a little inaccurate about the seafood dishes. My advice to all is that if you want a clam bake or a boil, go elsewhere, like Bookers.  If you want finer bistro seafood, Big Fish is a great option.    Foodie worthy = yes Return again = yes"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with some friends and sat at the bar. Good atmosphere and our server was very good. I ordered the butter chicken and lobster and was very disappointed, it should have been called \"kind of curry flavored soup with chicken and cauliflower\", there was one very tiny piece of lobster in this dish. The reason we chose this place was to have seafood and the description of this dish sounded so unique I just had to try it. On the other hand the crab and shrimp cakes were excellent, good enough for a return visit."}
{"text":"We decided to try Big Fish on a Friday on a friend's insistance, fair request, considering he played the \"B-day card\" overriding any protests made against going somewhere else. Had I actually gone here before, I would have protested, instead I happily went along.  I decided to splurge and ordered the 30 dollar dozen oyster special. They had six different varieties that came from both the east and west coasts. It also came with three different sauces and the mandatory lemon wedges. The oysters were fresh and I didn't suffer any post-oyster \"repercussions\". I did try the sauces on the side and they were ok, the aoli was the most memorable out of the three, but refrained from eating them with the oysters. I had chilled Sho Chiku Bai sake to go along with the oysters, which I thought was sub-par.  I followed up the meal with the grilled red chilli yuzu scented tuna skewer on soba noodle salad with lime and miso dressing. I liked the soba noodle and dressing, but didn't find the \"red chilli yuzu scented\" part of the tuna. The tuna skewer wasn't that impressive, it deserved the \"THATS IT!?\" reaction our table gave  The service was ok. However, the server seemed to have trouble hearing me even though the decibel level of my voice was adequate enough for the 1st-date couple beside our table to scowl at my inappropriate remarks. One of my friend's didn't like her at all, it seemed a mix of what he thought was bad service and plain chemistry, which paved way for hilarious \"sexual tension\" jokes.  I believe that three stars is fair for this place. I wasn't impressed by big fish at all and would consider going to other great restaurants along Edmonton Trail."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been on an extreme fish kick and decided we would head over to Big Fish for our anniversary--- The mussels were delicious but our entrées was not so spectacular..... it was under seasoned and the garnishes were blah.... for what they charge I expected more."}
{"text":"I came here for my sister's birthday and would definitely recommend it for a dinner celebration like we did. It's not too big, so it's got a real intimate feeling atmosphere. If you're planning on going with a larger group, make sure to make a reservation so they'll be able to accommodate you. But this made it feel like we had the whole joint to ourselves. Aside from our large group there were only a few other tables in the place.   On that note, it would be a great place to bring a fishy date, or a date in the mood for seafood. Either or.  If you want to switch it up from the usual wine with dinner option, they've got some very interesting cocktails to keep you entertained. It's been a while, but I believe my Caesar was garnished with pickled herring or something awesomely Nordic like that."}
{"text":"Last night a group of us went to celebrate a birthday. To tell you the truth, I wasn't expecting much. Just like I wouldn't expect great steak from Vancouver - it's just harder to get product that isn't native/close to the land. Anyway - Big Fish delivered big flavour. I LOVED my arctic char entree - the skin was crispy and so flavourful. The fish was a nice piece and not overcooked. I enjoyed the lentils and wild rice pilaf. Everyone raved about their food - from seafood pot, lamb and lobster burger (which looked fantastic - tower of decadence), special halibut of the day and organic butter chicken with lobster. The oysters were a hit at our table - on Monday it's buy a dozen get the other free. It's a small venue, so make reservations. Service was great too. Can't wait to try Big Fish out for brunch."}
{"text":"It was My Galpal's Birthday and she wanted to go to Big Fish.  She had seen it featured on 'You Gotta Eat Here' and was quite adamant about trying it.  Did it live up to her expectations? Enough that she wants to go back for dinner and bring The Guys and anyone else she can share her 'find' with!    We made reservations for 1 pm through the Open Table reservation format on the website.  When we arrived they seated us immediately and our server was wonderful about finding out everything from what was in each drink and dish, when we couldn't quite place the taste to being quick to get our orders in and checking back without being too obtrusive.     The seafood appetizer tray is a must taste for anyone who enjoys seafood.  The smoked sturgeon was our favourite and we were surprised to find it was hickory smoked right on the premises. The chutney on the plate was tasty and could have been an appetizer in it's own right with more pain croute, or as they called it 'croustini'.   There could have been a little more of the 'croustini' to spread the lovely salmon pate on.  And it could have been a little less crisp for the Galpal's tastes, but I liked the harder crunch for a contrast of textures.  Admittedly the lunch menu is very small,  but there are  brunch choices up until 2 so  My Galpal had an omelet stuffed with seafood and pronounced it excellent. Daughter of the Hot Pink Shoes had the salad with crab and grapefruit dressing.  Since we all shared bits of our lunches,  I tasted a bit of the salad and was impressed.  My soup, the seafood soup was hot, temperature wise, accompanied by a huge piece of grilled sourdough bread and every mouthful was wonderful.  A variety of finely chipped seafood was mixed into a creamy base.  The décor is quite simple and the restaurant is very clean with solid wood, comfortable chairs and quite a bit of light.   The huge mural paintings made  Daughter of the Shoes want to touch, and I was lost in their lines and abstract curves.    On to the best part - the Drinks!   Always on the lookout for new drinks,  we had three that were amazingly summery (it was July after all!).  My Tequila-tini was very well combined.  The tequila came through but so did enough other flavours I found myself asking 'what else is in this?\"  The other two drinks featured vodka and but I wish I'd grabbed a drink menu, because their drinks are that good!    Yes, you can take the drinks menu home to plan your next excursion.  Will I go back for dinner?  Yes.  It's a place I will go back to.  It's a bistro style of restaurant with a lot of class and very good seafood."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh seafood, love the fresh PEI import oysters. Staff very help if you are a first timer on the raw oysters. You will not be disappointed with this spot. Reservations for dinner is definitely recommended. This restaurant is relatively small, but it works."}
{"text":"Best chowder west of Mahone Bay. Best Paella west of the Ramblas. Great service. Can't wait for and excuse to go back. It's almost like a Tsunami washed a really good seafood restaurant up in Calgary."}
{"text":"Food was great--wild mushroom something or other with duck. The black cherry mimosas were pretty tasty too. Great place for brunch, a hidden gem for sure."}
{"text":"My husband, son and I came here for brunch on Family Day(it was fairly busy when we came, so we were glad that we made reservations on Open Table).  Our server was very pleasant and knowledgeable(though I did find it unusual that when we ordered teas, we didn't get any milk or sugar.  An honest mistake - I eventually asked the server to bring us some honey instead).  My son found his mango smoothie rather small(250-300ml glass, $4).        Okay folks, here's the \"food report\":   Creamy east coast seafood chowder with yuzu oil: our son loved the texture and flavor of this chowder, and of course, the garlic toast that came with it.  Eggs and bacon on English muffin, hash browns and grilled grapefruit: boys just love their bacon, eggs and hash browns, don't they? He didn't quite care for the grilled grapefruit(so I ate it), though.  * Mussels steamed with white wine, leek and creamy green curry: (please see our photo) this was a phenomenal dish.  These were the tastiest(and largest) mussels we've had in a long time--the green curry broth was exceptionally flavorful.  The problem was that our son kept eating all our garlic toast that was for the broth (even though our server kept bringing us extra toast).  Oh well, I guess it's better for mom and dad to have less carbs.  *Platter of smoked oysters, trout pate, candied salmon jerky, smoked sturgeon and smoked mackerel with wood-fired tomato chutney:  what a great platter! I died and went to heaven. ;)   Our server told us that all their oysters and fish were smoked and prepared in-house.    *These were generously portioned appetizers shared by hubby and me.  And yes, we did save room for dessert.  Our son had the orange creme caramel, which was very rich and creamy, but not too sweet.  We decided to share the lemon semolina shortcake with lemon curd and berries; and were impressed with the lightness of the cake and the smoothness of the lemon curd.  This was our first time here, but we will certainly be back soon.   I can't wait to try their pot-au-feu for dinner."}
{"text":"had the walleye, was quite fatty, my brother had the bucket of shrimp, which I veered far away from.  there was a rock in my lentil's, nearly lost a tooth.  Comp'd my meal though so it was ok."}
{"text":"Never even heard of Big Fish until tonight.  Spectacular.   I consider many things when I go out to eat.   How long I am able to sit and enjoy myself is one of them.    Some places I can't wait to shovel my food down just do I can make a prompt exit.    Big Fish was warm and cozy.   Quiet background music and a lovely hum of conversation.   Not like most chains that try to kill you with bad music that covers the clang bang of kitchen rush.   Started with mussels.  Beautiful.   Three of us slurped up every last drop.  Chicken and Lobster curry hot pot was great.    Flourless Chocolate torte with raspberries.   Can't even explain how delicious it was.    Three of us sat from 6:30 -10:00.  I call that a success and I'll be back to try other menu items.   Very exciting."}
{"text":"My sister and brother in law have made this their first choice when taking visitors out for breakfast. Not only do they have delicious food, amazing features, and damn good coffee, they ACCEPT BRUNCH RESERVATIONS!  how awesome is that?!  No matter  what you order, add a scone to your meal. They do sweet or savoury scones every week and they come to your table hot out if the oven. I'm talking steaming as you cut through. So good. So filling. But so so good!  Come hungry. By going through the menu with my siblings they didn't have a bad thing to say about any of the dishes. You can't go wrong. Their hash browns are baby potatoes done deliciously and their homemade ketchup was sooo good. It's got a hint of cinnamon that just makes this condiment pop. They also do a homemade jam - ours was blood orange blueberry which I would have purchased if they sold it via retail.   I wish there were one of these in yeg. I'd def be back for brunch and I'd love to try them for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place has exceptional food! Tried the salmon and walleye both fantastic. Great flavor and cooked to perfection.   The environment and service is on the casual side so don't expect high end dinning. It's a laid back atmosphere which is great for a night out or just with friends.   Tbh there is not much to say - if you enjoy seafood this is one of the best in the city!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and this is easily one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary.  Seafood doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Delicious, creatively prepared food with attentive friendly service and a cozy atmosphere...dine here! The menu is broad enough to satisfy everybody. This time my wife had fish cakes done to perfection and a sweet smoked salmon salad. The salad which I ate half of, was full of interesting but complementary flavors. They smoked the salmon themselves and tasted sweet with a smokey and flavorful.  I had the lamb/lobster burger served with their homemade tomato jam and fresh cut potato wedges. The burger was as juicy as the health board allows them to serve it. I like my meat with more pink in the middle and this was just over but still very good. The brioche bun was little dry but good. Not sure if they made this. Our service was a little slow to start as they just had several people arrive at the same time. It was 1/2 full and only 5:15. Our table was prepared for us before we got there. Make reservations would be a good idea in case they have a busy night. Our server , the full time occupational therapist part time server... sorry I forgot her name was both interesting and friendly . If she did not know the answer to a question she had lots of backup.  One last thing....I find it very important to serve food fresh and HOT! as soon as the prep is done. Several people made sure that we had our food as soon as it was prepared and took great care to do so. Thank you!  PS if you want to eat at the bar and watch the kitchen it looks like fun.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"I did not expect anything spectacular when I went into this restaurant.  But when I saw their menu I got a little more excited.  The person I as dining with and I ONLY got appetizers,  4 to be exact.    He got a beer and I got the Virgin ceasar.  And both drinks were so good.  In my ceasar I had pickled herring.  Yummmmmn   For our meal we ordered: clam chowder,  mussles,  bucket of peel Shrimp,  oysters.     Even thought it wasn't much.  We left the restaurant...  Really full.  The chowder is so light and flavourful,  mussles were huuuuge, Shrimp...  Is Shrimp.  But what was also so good....  Their bread that came with the soup and the mussles.  Oh God.  It was soo good.    I would definitely come back!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely date night at Big Fish. Great ambience and lovely food. I had a bubbly red wine (\"Lambrusca\" Rossa) and my husband had the Gentleman's Buck. We had West Coast oysters, dinner, drinks and desert and the price was very reasonable. My husband loved his catfish n' grits dinner special, and I appreciated some gluten-free options."}
{"text":"Good food! I really liked the fish tacos. It was flavourful! However, the fish chunks were a bit on the dry side. Their trout burger is also awesome! Really moist fish. The yam chips were also great. The service was pretty decent! The ladies were friendly and attentive. They are good with recommending dishes for first-timers. The only down side is the price. I was slightly shocked with the slightly higher bill for a lunch. But overall, really good place!"}
{"text":"Oh my. Pistachio-crusted Arctic char, plated at just the right temperature and paired with a light, crisp 2013 La Vieille Ferme. What's more, I couldn't pass up this dessert: maple pecan pie with vanilla bean mousse. Mmm. I haven't had a fish entree executed so well in some time. Big Fish is appropriately named! Stay away if you don't like fish. Seriously."}
{"text":"Best service I have had in a restaurant in north america! The hostess was attentive, entertaining but not intrusive. It was free corkage night, and they made no fuss that we brought our own bottle of wine, they even brought a container of ice to chill it, and the hostess opened and served. Nice touch! They also made a whiskey sour with egg white for my brother, (not on the menu)   The food was quite nice. We had a variety of dishes for the table, and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I love Big Fish for everything - the seafood, the slightly nautical/antique feeling you have walking in, the staff, even the ever present draft that makes me recommend bringing a sweater. I always feel like I've stepped onto a pirate ship. The owners of the place also own Diner Deluxe and Open Range, and they bring the same sort of spin to Big Fish.  Lunches here are delicious. I definitely recommend the soft shell crab club sandwich. It is so delicious and very unusual... It took a little getting used to biting into the shell. The fish and chips are fried to perfection, and some of the best you'll find on this side of the Rockies.   For the brunch, their eggs beni with crab is an excellent choice. We always get a bucket'o'oysters and shrimp, which is ever-tasty. All of the garnishes are housemade, so any ketchup, mayo or jam is fresh and flavorful.  I find Big Fish a tad pricey-yet-informal for a fancy dinner, but it is perfect for a casual night out. My favourite meal there is the surf and turf, the lobster tail and the alberta steak. In my experience, it has always been cooked to perfection.  Every time I've been the service has been quite good and the food delicious. It is definitely one of Calgary's better seafood restaurants, and the fact that they only buy from sustainable fisheries helps me rest a little bit more at night."}
{"text":"When I woke up this morning I was in the mood for lobster, and sick and tired of Red Lobster I thought I should Yelp search engine it.  I found many good reviews about Big Fish so I went and checked it out.  It was an easy location to find and there is adequate free parking in the back of the restaurant. The exterior is kind of kitschy and once inside it reflected the exterior, but I kind of liked it.    The waiter was pleasant and sat me at a sunny table quickly with a menu of food choices and a bar menu which was presented on an old nautical board, nice touch!  I ordered two orders of lobster tail at $13 each, I was prepared to pay around $25 dollars so I thought why not go for it.  I had a choice between wild rice and mashed potatoes so I ordered the taters. The meal came out in a heaping helping, although there were two tails on my plate I found the lobster tails to be quite small but I figured for Calgary this is probably the appropriate portion I would find for that price.  I dug in and it was quite delicious, the lobster was cooked very well, it was fresh and tender and had just the right amount of herbs and spices.  The mash came with a nice helping of red peppers, zucchini, carrots and I could taste the hints of rosemary and thyme in the mix.  There was also a very nicely dribbled basil olive oil as a decor detail.  Other than the small lobster tails it was a very nice filling lunch.  The service was perfect and I came out with a bill slightly under $30.  If you are a lobster or seafood fan this place is the spot to swim to."}
{"text":"Wow, brunch was amazing! Fresh, flavourful, and healthy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had brunch here on Sunday with my mom and I was blown away! First of all, I LOVE being able to make a reservation because I absolutely hate waiting for my breakfast. Even though we were running a few minutes behind schedule, a quick call to Big Fish assured me we would be fine, and as soon as we arrived we were seated! I loved the plush pillows on the seat, made for a cozy meal, and the interior was cute and funky. I did expect a bit more kitsch, thinking they would play up the name with more nautical themed decor. They kept it simple and honestly, it works because the food is the main focus (one thing I will note is that I would have liked it a little brighter inside!). We started with the Strawberry Watermelon Mimosa's and they were fabulous - I could have drank them all morning. We wanted oysters but seeing that it was 10:30AM, I jokingly asked the waiter if it would be weird, and he said definitely not! That's all we needed, and proceeded to down the half dozen in a matter of minutes. Delicious. I ordered the Mushroom, Truffle, and Duck Confit Hash which was quite honestly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Very rich, decadent, and delicious - I had enough to take home for the next day. I finished with an Open Range coffee and felt soooo satisfied. I cant comment on the price, because my mom paid (thanks, Ma!) but I will DEFINITELY be back, I am in love!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Devine! The open kitchen adds character. The service is beyond what I usually expect when I dine out. I got the Ruby Trout and ate every last bit. I will be going back again, I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Date night on a Saturday with hubby! So nice to chill with a glass of cava and oysters on the half shell...yummy!  Hubby had a yummy clam chowder served with a nicely charred slice of bread and his main was a trout with lobster polenta and caviar. Mine is a pistachio crusted Arctic char with mash. Very tasty!  Portions were a good size. Not too much or too little and we were both too full for dessert. In fact we wandered to the riverfront to walk off our meal...our waitress was attentive and  helpful without being overly intrusive. We will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Had to try this restaurant related to open range and just next door! I tried the saffron butter baked oysters and hubby had clam chowder! The soup was the best I've ever had, and oysters were good! I had a Mai Tini it was okay but the lemon drop was to die for!!  For Main my hubby had Pistachio crusted Artic char with polenta which was fantastic, and I had Walleye with rice, it was really good but the Char and polenta was my favourite! Service was good, but not fantastic no interaction and just took our order and no suggestions or friendly service! I prefer Open range way more, but glad we tried it!"}
{"text":"A couple gfs of mine insisted on taking me out for a birthday dinner.  They were doing some research when Big Fish came up.  To be honest I got reeeeeally excited when they mentioned Big Fish as I heard many good things about them and I've always wanted to give them a try.  Open Range/Big Fish share an angled parking lot, but street parking is available too.  Reservations were made for Monday, 5:15PM so we hit up Big Fish right after work.  We arrived a few minutes early but it was pretty empty.  We got seated in the corner which was nice for some privacy and poured glasses of water immediately.  We were handed menus and told the feature.  Monday nights are their buy one get one deal for oysters when you order by the dozen.  We went with two dozen and there are east and west coast varieties, we went with one of each to start.  Carly ordered a house made lemonade and Michelle ordered the dark & stormy float (dark cuban rum, spicy ginger beer and cinnamon ice cream).  We then ordered mains, Carly ordered the pistachio crusted Arctic Char that came with sundried olive truffle butter and sage mashed potatoes.  Being from Manitoba, I haven't had walleye (aka pickerel) in a long time so I went with the walleye which came with wild rice pilaf mixed in with wilted spinach, pine nuts and crispy boar bacon.  Michelle went with the lamb and lobster burger which was topped with cambozola cheese, guacamole and salsa, instead of the roasted potatoes, she went with the clam chowder.  The oysters came out with a bunch of lemon wedges, tabasco sauce, house ponzu, some anchovy mignonette, a four chili cocktail sauce as well as horseradish made in house.  OK so this was surprisingly my first time having a raw oyster - a squeeze of lemon, squirt of ponzu sprinkled with some salted and topped with horseradish I closed my eyes and swallowed while I tapped my heels not believing what I just did!!.....it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be :P.  Carly and Michelle really enjoyed the oysters!  Anyway, our mains followed shortly, all three dishes came out at once and I was suuuuuper excited as everything looked amazing.  I had a bite of the Arctic Char and it was really good, tender fish with the crispy skin and the pistachio texture was lovely, I also had a bite of the lamb and lobster burger and it was tasty as well!  The lamb wasn't as over powering as I expected and the guacamole was a nice touch.  I finally got to my walleye, they kept the skin on which I don't LOVE skin but this was nice and crisp.  The walleye was good but not the best I've had - I guess since I'm from MB I'm pickier but it was nonetheless fantastic.  The wild rice pilaf was SO GOOD, bits of beans, bacon, spinach, pine nuts all in one bite, yum!!  We all polished our plates right off!  I was perfectly full but there's ALWAYS room for dessert in my books.  I'm super lucky to have friends that love dessert as much as I do!  I read reviews about this pecan pie of theirs so I knew I was dead set on ordering that.  We also ordered flourless chocolate hazelnut ganache torte and lemon lavender shortbread tart as recommended by our waitress.  To my surprise, she came out with a sparkler on one of the cakes which made my heart melt :)  I was overwhelmed because we had three delicious desserts sitting in front of us - it's like I want them all at once but cant.  I went for the pecan pie and it was love at first bite!! I had high expectations from other reviews and it met my expectations!! SO GOOD!! The pecan pie had almost a crumble of crushed up sugared pecans and it went well with the vanilla bean mousse.  We were worried the lavender would be too overpowering for the lemon tart but it was a very subtle lavender taste, nice browned crust with a sweet smooth lemon filling. The flourless chocolate hazelnut ganache torte came with raspberries, I'm not a huge fan of chocolate raspberry combo but this was good, the chocolate hazelnut torte has a crunchy outside with a soft inside.  My first experience at Big Fish was absolutely delightful.  Our waters were filled without question, the food and presentation was amazing and the desserts were just the icing on my birthday cake - wonderful.  There's nothing better than enjoying a delicious meal with great company.  I HIGHLY recommend Big Fish to anyone and everyone.  I will be back for their brunch menu!! :)"}
{"text":"Oh how I hate it when a place fails to meet high expectations. Before we went here I was telling myself things like \" finally, a real seafood place in calgary!\" let's just say I have heard some really good things about big fish, but what I experienced was a 180 degree flip from what I was expecting!   Now before I proceed with a recount of my experience let me say: Calgary,because of it's location should not be expected to have good seafood restaurants. So take in this review with that mind.In our city one should never expect to recreate a seaside eating experience, because the best ingredient in any fish recipe is the freshness, the less you do with fresh fish the better!  So me and my good pal Andy ( birthday boy!) got to big fish right on time and were extremely exited to check this place out. They sat us down and right away made us dump our Starbucks coffee into proper cups ( I had a feeling because of this occurrence they labeled us and turned up their nose from this point). All was well.As we were waiting for a few more of our friends to arrive  we wanted to order some oysters. We waited, waited some more and for like 15 mins and no offer for drinks or any appetizers so I flagged down one of the waiters and he went to get our waitress and we finally got to order our P.E.I oysters. The waitress was cold and uninspired and seemed pissed???? Huh?? did we do anything wrong??? basically gave me the impression she didn't give a crap. She brought the oysters with no explanation and we proceeded to eat them and they were great! However the 3 sauces they provided were absolutely useless. The minonette was way to salty, the aioli was blah so I didn't even bother trying the other one . This was the 3rd cue that something was out of phase at big fish, the waves were just not lined up.  So our other friends arrived and I was trying to stay positive and still exited to have some good seafood. We ordered some more apps, the mussels and the crab with shrimp cakes both fine. When we started to eat the mussels I noticed that their was a dead mussel in the bunch.Normally at any place that serves seafood the person who cooks the mussels is supposed to make sure that they all opened (indicating they were all alive prior to cooking) it can actually be very dangerous and pose a serious risk for food poisining it you eat an Unopened mussel because you don't know how long they have been dead for. So I told our waitress and she simply did not respond and gave me a sarcastic smile. Ok now cue 4 ,no simple \"sorry\" or small compensation??? At a seafood place that promotes itself as high quality and upper scale?? Huh???   So i let the mussel debacle go and we ordered the entree. I got the pork chop( steering clear of seafood at this point) with a wild rice and bean mix and some veg. I asked for medium, I got overcooked,cue 5 the beans and wild rice were terrible, it would have been fine if some of the beans were not undercooked, (cue 6 now!) the person cooking was either having a bad night or should not be cooking in a place with 30 dollar entrees, come on these are amateur mistakes!   So at this point I am just laughing it off! And I wanna be clear here, I REALLY wanted to like this place but due to the service and the food I simply could not. Ending the night with a 80 dollar tab was a hard pill to swallow thinking back to what I just experienced but oh well lesson learned!   Ohhh one other thing! To end on a positive note, the pecan Pie was actually quite good!  And yes the mussels were great! ( thanks P.E.I!) just stay clear of the sauce bar, taste the pure flavour !  Either way! believe who you will and maybe give this place a chance, it is quite possible I am just a customer who had bad luck and got all the misses of the night!  I just can't reccomend it in good conscience though, they lost themselves a customer for life."}
{"text":"Big Fish for dinner - The menu says the owner likes cocktails, and I don't think the menu is lying. The list of cocktails is well-thought through and uses a lot of fresh ingredients. They have a great wine list as well.  The food is...mostly seafood! I bet you aren't surprised by this. A good selection of dishes, nothing too heavy and I'm always impressed by a restaurant that can do all kinds of seafood well when it is located very far from water.   Big Fish for brunch - This has been my go-to for weekend brunch for over two years now. A number of the brunch options include seafood, but you can get some other items as well (just in case you don't feel like smoked fish in the mornings...but trust me IT'S GOOD). The important things to note:   *It's more expensive than Denny's, but it is also that much more delicious.   *The coffee is strong. Exactly what you want for brunch, none of that brown water you get with a diner-brunch   *Some of the staff is really friendly, some are a bit eccentric. Roll with it.   *The owners own Urban Baker (and a list of other restos in town) so I hear the bread is good - they also have great potatoes (which I can eat) that are buttery delicious and pair perfectly with the Bajan hot sauce they have on hand.   * Big Fish does fantastic morning booze. If that doesn't sell you on the place, we probably won't see eye-to-eye on anything and you probably shouldn't read any more of my reviews."}
{"text":"The Big Fish does not have a whole lot of fish on its weekend brunch menu.  However, there was seafood chowder which was rich with seafood and quite delicious, with a light tasty broth.  With it I had a bison burger, much juicier than bison burgers usually run, and very fine with bacon and various other toppings.  Finely made and cared-for food, friendly service on the ball in a fairly busy place."}
{"text":"What is not to like? This little gem has a relaxing almost coastal vibe. The music has you singing along and the staff make you feel at home. The dishes are divine; chowder that tastes like mom made it from scratch and original touches such as homemade ketchup as an alternative for little hands to dip their peel and eat shrimp in if the five Chili cocktail sauce is too spicy. Mmm the mussels swimming in their green curry is so good you may have to order more bread for soaking up the last mouthful. I cannot leave this review before mentioning the asparagus lasagne! Hands down the most decadent of the collection we tried. There was no way I could have left any portion of it behind regardless of how seriously full I was. That good. I should have taken pictures. Make reservations. It will be with it."}
{"text":"Hmm... what to say.  Well, I would say the words overhyped, pricey and loud pretty much comes to mind first.  The mussels  was quite good though, and based on that alone, I would say it's a great place for drinks and appys though they really need to drop the sound levels.  I understand music for atmosphere, but it's hard to enjoy a meal when you can't here a damn thing more than 3 ft away unless people are screaming.  I also ordered the special that night, a tilapia in a brown paper bag.  It was ok, but nothing too overwhelming.  I would say that it was slightly above average, but nothing that I probably couldn't do myself in my kitchen.  Outside of that, my companion and I basically spent the rest of the dinner being more or less fed, but not entirely greatly satisfied.  When I go to a seafood resto, honestly I expect a better meal than say a Red Lobster, but it wasn't that much better, or about the same as one, but at twice the price and three times the audio volume.  Would I go again?  Maybe as a guest, but in all honesty once was probably enough."}
{"text":"Our craving for fresh oysters brought us to Big FIsh. We decided to go on a Wednesday night, for bring your own wine with free corkage, and my sister's fiance selected a perfect pairing for our meal.   To start off we ordered a half dozen of oysters. There were 6 different varieties from east and west coast, so we decided to get a a mix. Each one more delicious than the last.   Next, we got the open face fish tacos appetizer. The fish was fresh, the tortilla was fresh. And nothing was left on our plates.   The grilled tuna salad on soba noodles was up next. I love salad, but I don't usually like ordering salad out because it sometimes seems like a waste. The freshness and flavors in this salad made it anything but ordinary.    If that wasn't enough food, we still had the special of the day that came with fresh sword fish, asparagus and mashed potatoes.   Then as a fabulous way to end the meal we shared the orange creme caramel.   Big Fish is highly recommended as some of the best seafood in Calgary."}
{"text":"This a great place for a nice evening with friends or a romantic dinner for two.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience from the moment we walked through the door.  The service was good and with soft jazz/blues playing in the background really added to the atmosphere.  The best part of the night was the food.  We couldn't stop expressing our satisfied pallet throughout our meal.  With fresh seafood and the incredible talent of the chefs to created amazing flavors that melt in your mouth; I can guarantee that whatever you order off the menu will impress your taste buds and feed your soul."}

{"text":"I went to Big Fish on an early Saturday evening.  With the amount of positive reviews, I wanted to check the place out.  When we arrived, the neighborhood looked pretty sh*tty, but we didn't let that deter us from checking out the restaurant.  They have a free private parking lot in the back which was nice.  When we walked in, Big Fish was empty, probably getting ready for dinner time.  We were seated near the window and ordered some oysters for $2.95 each.  They were served with house ponzu, caper anchovy mignonette, four-chili cocktail, and Tabasco sauce.  They were good, but definitely not worth that price.  We then ordered two items from their Dockside Plates menu; fish tacos with roasted chilies, guacamole, and oven dried tomato mango salsa for $15 and the ginger sweet soy glazed swordfish and prawn skewer on smoked sea salt fries for $21.  Again, although the food was good, it was overpriced.  The swordfish and prawn skewer only had 3 small pieces of fish and 2 shrimps total.  The tacos just came with 3 flour tortilla tacos, no sides like beans and rice.  Overall, the food was good and we had friendly service.  However, it was definitely too much money for what it was.  The small skewer didn't have enough meat on it and the tacos didn't warrant a $15 charge when it came with no sides.  Oysters at $2.95 each was pretty ridiculous as well, so I wished they gave a deal when ordering a dozen or more.  I would come back if I wanted quality seafood, but that price would definitely have me second-guessing my decision.  Pros: -Private parking lot in the back -Food quality -Friendly service  Cons: -Too pricey"}
{"text":"Our quest for a quality seafood restaurant in Calgary brought us to Big Fish on Friday and I must say the best description for this place is \"meh\".  This place as an oyster bar is great  since they were the best thing about it.  The Leslie Hardy P.E.I. oysters were fresh and delish making me eager to sample the 5 other varieties.  However the rest did not match its price tag.  The steamed mussels in wine sauce were nothing special except for the specially dead one at the bottom of the bowl.  Which prompted a blank stare from our server when brought to her attention.  I tend to be really generous when judging server performance but this lady takes the cake.  She did nothing about our dead mussels and when asked to describe a particular main course she just said \"It's delicious\" with a snooty smile.  I mean this could just be an isolated incident but experience is a big factor in the enjoyment of a restaurant.  Anyway moving on lol.  The main I had was the blackened sirloin steak w/ blue crab cake and roast pepper jelly.  Again not worth it's price.  The steak was a tad dry and you can find an equally tasty crab cake in you local frozen food aisle.  In terms of service, other than that passive aggressive banshy, the rest were pretty pleasant and helpful.  And the setup is rather comfy but a gigantic mirror behind your table is pretty distracting especially for a vain person such as myself.   I know I may have come off as a food snob here, but when ones bill comes to $80, one earns the right to snob it up! lol.  For now the quest continues....but until then I recommend hitting up T&T market, grab yourself some live crabs, mussels and lobsters steam them up and you've got yourself a seafood feast that can not be matched for half the price. Well in Calgary at least.    HAPPY EATING!"}
{"text":"First time here, came solely because of Yelp reviews.  Had a reservation, but it wasn't full. Was seated by a kind hostess and our server was Susan.  We ordered a recommended bottle of Slovenian white wine which paired incredibly with our food.  started with raw oysters - a smattering of today's selection and of the 4, enjoyed two of the west coast styles so much we ordered another round of them.  Second up was a chowder for hubby and crab&shrimp cakes for me.  The cakes were AMAZING and the small citrus & seaweed slaw on the side was an excellent palate cleanser.  Hubby RAVED over the chowder.  Next up was a chowder for me and the pistachio crusted artic chat for him.  Again, both fantastic.  The service was above par and the atmosphere was casual and welcoming.  Will go again."}
{"text":"I just moved blocks away from what I'm sure will go down in the Calgary  history books as Brunch Avenue (I am still working on a better title...suggestions?) aka Edmonton Trail.   We were searching for a brunch place at 1:00PM on a Saturday and we literally walked into Big Fish with no wait. Crazy.  I know I'm a bit late to the party, Big Fish wins awards and is on all kinds of \"eat here\" lists but I've never been.   The atmosphere was great, laid back and quiet. Awesome service and great food! I had whatever omelette is supposed to be with Chorizo Sausage (I forget the actual name) but with baby shrimp and gluten free toast. It was fantastic and fairly priced.  I would totally go there again and I want to go back for fish. Perhaps even some big fish.  (Yikes, lame)"}
