{"text":"Had breakfast at Victorio's this morning.  Service was good, but food mediocre.  Ordered the meat lover skillet-not typical for me but I found menu to be pretty short for a greasy spoon like this.  My partner had the gyro deluxe skillet which came with spinach, tomato, feta and dried gyro meat.  Another reviewer had commented on the gyro meat being so fresh- this was not the case for us.  My skillet, while good, had a very slender layer of egg-probably one egg.  Toast smelled old, but came buttered-a nice touch.  I agree that this place could one day be seen on the show Restaurant Impossible as its in dire need of updating and cleaning.  We left feeling dirty, honestly.  The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived, yet we were seated in the very next booth next to others and no thought was given about spreading out the customers who arrived after we did.  Oh, and perhaps most disturbing about our first visit, the other customers.  We were seated in a booth between two mothers on either side that just had to talk on their cell phones throughout their breakfast and ours.  Yes, they had kids with them, but their phone conversations were more important than setting a good example.  Jerks.  Sorry, but we won't be returning and are still trying to find the right place for a good, quiet breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been to several Greek-American restaurants when visiting the Cleveland area. As one reviewer stated, they try hard with several types of foods from Greek to Polish. They are a Greek establishment, so order the Greek food. The gyro platter and gyro breakfasts are quite good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local places for a diner type breakfast. Typical staples, plus additional goodies like \"skillet\" breakfasts. Breakfasts are freshly made with handcut homefries. Absolute favorite thing there is any breakfast featuring gyro meat, from gyro omelets to gyro platters, you can't go wrong with fresh gyro in your breakfast.   Lunch and dinner is fairly standard with different specials from day to day that range from a decent chicken paprikash to Greek pasticio. As always, grab a gyro, it comes from a real gyro spit, not pre-cut and warmed like some places do."}
{"text":"A nice place to stop for lunch if you're in Parma Heights for some reason, but I can't help but shake the feeling that this place could be on \"Restaurant: Impossible\" some day.  The menu is a mix of Greek, Italian, \"Americana\" diner fare, and some Hungarian / Polish treats. (It's Northeast Ohio. Of course there are Pierogies.) I ended up trying the stuffed cabbage rolls for lunch and found them pretty good, especially at the daily special price of $8, but not really over the top. The meal also came with home fries, which were interesting - it looked like the potatoes were cut into long strips and then cooked on the flat top rather than being diced up or fried - almost like a gigantic fluffy potato pancake.  Service was fine but kind of distracted. I noticed the waitress was trying to manage her kids at the same time as taking care of her tables.   Decor is...mixed. Carpeted floors, a buffet that looks like it was turned off and left in place, a bunch of flags all over the place, and a few TVs. To go with the R:I theme, it feels like the whole place is really unfocused. Someone working to re-focus the menu and the appearance of the restaurant would go a long, long way."}
{"text":"A nice little diner joint in the nether-region between Parma and Parma Heights. Went here for breakfast, and nothing was lacking in the least. The woman walking around refreshing the coffee was one of the most persistent waitresses I have ever encountered. Look, lady, I DON'T WANT ANY MORE COFFEE! Got one of the griddle bowls, which was basically a whole bunch of breakfast meat, cheese and country gravy in a bowl. All in all, a good place to grab breakfast. (Good luck figuring out the place's nationality, though -- there were Irish, Polish, Hungarian AND German flags hanging everywhere.)"}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant and poor food quality. Glasses and utensils look to be original and not in a good way. Don't let the \"gyro\" everything lure you in like it did me. It's just dry and chopped! Not tender slices. Boo Victorios! If you're thinking about stopping just keep driving and go anywhere but here."}
