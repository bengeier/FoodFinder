{"text":"Fuze just opened on 4th Street SW in the old 4th Street Rose spot. That particular location hasn't had much luck since the Rose closed so it will be interesting to see how Fuze will do.   From a decor standpoint it is clean, not overly interesting but they did put effort into carpets and walls. The gorgeous skylight - one of the features of this room - was still filthy. I don't know if that is a function of the weather or if they didn't clean it to begin with.   The lunch menu is nice, not over the top but certainly nicely varied. I asked to take a look at the brunch menu (looked amazing) and the dinner menu (looked like lunch but with a few more additions).   I can only use one word to describe my meal: SALT. I had the bison burger which was salty but not particularly flavourful, with a side salad that had so much salt in the dressing it was almost inedible. My dining companions had the Chicken Pot Pie (pronounced good but not fabulous, a bit salty) and the Steak Frites (which was apparently really good).   The service was very attentive, and the wine list wasn't bad at all.   I'd give Fuze another shake. They still might be working out opening kinks, and from a location standpoint if they can draw a crowd they may well be successful.   But for the love of the lord chef - put down the salt shaker."}
{"text":"Fuze on Fourth moved into Mission after closing its doors in Banff. We like to support local shops and restaurants, so we decided to check it out a few months ago. Many visits later, Fuze has become a favorite.  My interpretation of Fuze's menu: A fusion of Indian, Thai (they make some great green curry seafood dishes including a yummy calamari risotto), Mediterranean and French classics like beef bourgignon. Their panko-crusted goat cheese salad with walnut vinagrette is a nice light lunch option.  Their dessert selections also solid and generously sized: They have a heart-warming sticky toffee pudding and a massive messy black forest cake (though I would like a little more chocolate flavor in the cake). On weekends, Fuze's brunch is a treat too.  Since their opening, I think Fuze has streamlined their menu including their wine and drink list which I don't think is a bad thing. They offer flights of wine (4 samples for 20$) for those who can't decide and want a taste before committing to a whole bottle!  Service: Always friendly, a little clumsy at times (I can tell who may be new staff members), but apologetic, personable and warm.   Ambience: Open, airy feeling with high ceilings and skylights. I don't care for the color scheme too much, particularly the maroon vinyl coverings on the tables (but it does make them easier to clean). In the summer, the patio is a great place to people watch and enjoy 4th street."}
{"text":"We finally got down to Fuze on Fourth this weekend and had a terrific lunch! The space is the former 4th Street Rose, bright, sunny, spacious. We were greeted immediately and seated on the 'atrium' side of the restaurant. The service was efficient and friendly throughout.   The menu isn't long, but there is plenty to choose from. Looking for something refreshing and nonalcoholic? Try one of their Jet Sodas, lovely. The wine list is good and they have a number of wine flights if you want to do a little tasting on your own. Any of the wines on the flight list can be ordered by the glass as well.   The Roasted Tomato Soup is nothing less than spectacular and is an optional side with any of their sandwiches. I had the Louisiana Shrimp Po'Boy which I very much enjoyed, even though I generally do not like deep-fried shrimp (in this case with Panko coating). As part of the whole, it was great. My husband had the Ham & Cheese fondue sandwich, yum Gruyere! We plan to go back soon to try the Sunday brunch, we took a look at the menu and it looks fantastic. I just know that the Blueberry Bread pudding would please anyone.   Nice spot, great service, creative tasty food. I can hardly wait until the summer, though the patio is small, it is right on the street on the sunny side ... those are the best kind."}
{"text":"Having heard that Fuze had just opened, a friend and I hit it up earlier this month. Although it was 6pm on a Wednesday, definitely around the dinner hour, I was the *only* one in the restaurant when I arrived. Which I thought a bit odd. The space is nice and open. I like the decor. And on the lower level, the patio area will be wonderful for when it's warmer. But the gorgeous skylight needed to be cleaned desperately.  The server was nice and dropped by our table on a regular basis, although a little pushy when it came to whether we were ready to order and with presenting the bill before we were quite done. Overally very friendly and made you smile while she was chatting with you.  We both opted for snack-y meals, I had the Spicy Indian onion bajia. It wasn't quite what I had expected, but an excellent dish all the same.  While not outstanding, I'll definitely give Fuze another try. I'd like to check out what the full meals have to offer!"}
{"text":"Fuze is one of those places that I really really want to give 3.5 stars to, because it's more than a 3, but is currently just a wee bit shy of a 4. I quite enjoyed the layout, a main floor with bar, a sunken level with a gloriously huge skylight the length of the entire room, and I do believe a private room way up top (that's just a guess, but we could see what looked like a finished room from down below, and a stairwell near the back).  I loved the steel blue colour of the seats against the brick wall in the skylight section. And with a wall of doors that open onto a small patio, this is going to be a nice spot to sit in the summer. I too noticed, though, that the skylight wasn't all that clean. Perhaps the roof is a bit too treacherous yet to get someone up there for a wiping?  We were here for some appys and cocktails. Loved my root beer float! It was like being a kid again... except one of legal drinking age ;). My crispy crab roll was also a fun treat, 8 pieces in all was a nice snack-I just wish the little bowl holding my soy sauce was a little bigger, the rolls wouldn't fit!  Service from the time we sat down to when we paid our bill was A1. Our server was friendly and attentive, despite having just flown into town and started her shift after what sounded like a long journey. I admire how chipper she remained. The only downfall here was after we paid, we weren't quite done chatting yet, so we settled the bill but hung around for a good 30 minutes or more and no-one came back to even refill our water glasses. :(   At any rate, I hear good things about their tomato soup, in the words of the server \"it's not just any tomato soup...\" Sounds like a reason to come back for some lunch!"}
