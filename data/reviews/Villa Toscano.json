{"text":"Really excited to have this extension of Cafe Toscano here in Solon. We got their Fruite del Mare and Cajun Fettucini, two of our favorite dishes which tasted the same as at the original restaurant. Looking forward to visiting this location more often"}
{"text":"I have dined here twice and plan on going back again soon.  I had the pizza and chopped salad and enjoyed them both.  My husband thought the garlic rolls had a bit too much butter, but they prepared a new batch for us without any hesitance. He also thought the minestrone soup could use o little more seasoning, but the sausage appetizer was very good. The restaurant was surprisingly empty, but I think that will change - especially when the weather is warm and the patio is open.  I am looking forward to eating here next time and walking next door to catch a movie."}
{"text":"The Newly Renovated Banquet is simply beautiful . Delicious appetizers and meals prepared by our best Chefs. Jena and her Team are ready to make your Event special for all.  Come and see for yourself. You will be blessed."}
{"text":"DON'T BOTHER!!! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE First of all...No one greeted us at the door so we sat ourselves. The bartender then told us she'd be right with us. We proceeded to wait 15 minutes with no one even coming to our table to even offer us water so we left and went to the Mexican restaurant down the street"}
{"text":"5:53. Honestly, haven't even gotten to the food yet and aggravated. Do not eat in the bar area. The lady that was working is not hospitable, rude and has the spins. Those in the business know what I mean. I asked to watch the Indians game at 6:10 and she said the people in the other room want to watch the Cavs game (started at 8) and they're a big party (translation bigger tip). At this point, the food could be incredible and it wouldn't matter."}
{"text":"Family environment with excellent food and service. NEWLY RENOVATED BANQUET ROOM - simply beautiful."}
{"text":"Awful. The place used to be great when it was jimmy didanos. We thought we would give it one more try since we went twice when it first opened. Unfortunately service and food went from bad to worse. Definitely would not recommend nor will we return."}
{"text":"We have been to Cafe Toscano in Aurora and loved it so we decided to try to give the sister restaurant a try.  There weren't too many guests there but we couldn't figure out why.  The appetizer meatballs and stuffed mushrooms were really good as was the lasagna.  My daughter had the fettuccini Alfredo and loved it.  The portions were large too!  The garlic knots were hot and delicious as well. Even the salad with the house balsamic was very tasty. Waitresses were very friendly.   We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"We loved the food and the bread is out of this world!    Very good choice of dishes.  The service was timely and the waitress knew the the dishes and helped us make our selections.   Sooo many choices!!!  We will go back many times."}
{"text":"My husband & I visited for lunch today, remembering the old Jimmy Dadanas. Ordered Salmon & risotto, adequate but nothing special, salmon a tad overdone. Garlic knots not as fresh or tasty as before. No salad came with either entr√©e. I had the chicken piccatta, sauce was tasty with capers & artichokes, and I added shrimp to it also. However the chicken was in 2 smaller pieces, one was alright, able to cut with the steak knife, but the 2nd piece had my husband staring at my sawing vigorously to cut it. When I  ate it, it was weirdly dry and crunchy- gave my husband a piece to try & he said something was wrong with it. Told the waitress, she did replace it with one piece chicken, however, I think I have lost my preference for chicken anymore. We did take a chocolate cake home for dessert. The bill without any salads, appetizers, or drinks came to just under 48$ without tip, pretty pricey for an uninspired lunch. I did ask for meat sauce on the side of spaghetti that came with my meal, I had to pay an upcharge of 4$ for that luxury item. Won't be going back...."}
{"text":"Great homemade food, minestrone soup is out of this world. Must get the chicken Pictta Friendly staff  Try the desserts!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service was very attentive.  My husband had the spaghetti with two huge meatballs .  I had the 12 layer lasagna.  Generous portions and the garlic knots are to die for"}
{"text":"Confused.... is this Belladona's or Toscano's? Both names are displayed.  This resturant was previously Jimmy Daddona's. The decor has not been updated and most of the previous menu is being offered, however at a much higher price.   Wait staff is friendly but overwhelmed. Man in tee shirt and pajama bottoms serves as cashier / hostess.  The rolls are good....."}
{"text":"server did not service us but promptly checked on everyone else... we were ready to order drinks at the bar but no menu or hello was given.  They did see us, but never came over to take our order. I left with my group to go somewhere else esp. since I was waiting for more than 20 min (to just grab a drink!) and had a movie to catch ?"}
{"text":"Spaghetti Marinara and Eggplant Parmigiana were excellent. Portions were very large, rolls were great, Travis our server and Tommy our bus boy were excellent. Place was very busy, but we were seated quickly. Prices were in line with other Italian restaurants."}
{"text":"Closes in 55 minutes. Hmmm. That may be a little premature but I would guess this place will not be open for much longer. Call it Belladonas. Villa Tuscano. Toscano.  We had the worst dinner we ever had tonight. Sat at the bar and Jena gave us menus and \"going to get bread\" she said. We asked for drinks first. Good thing. After she served she was gone for 20 minutes. No bread.   Another lady stopped by and gave us 2 new drinks and took our order. Asked her for bread. Salad came. Asked for the bread we were promised when we walked in.   20 minutes later our dinner was served. Asked for the bread again and Parmesan cheese. Nothing. 10 minutes later snagged a waitress who came to get drinks for her table (no bartender). Asked for bread and cheese again.   Finally after eating 3/4 of my veal Parmesan I got bread and cheese.   I have never had such a horrible dinner. I left a 2 cent tip. My 2 cents is that if the owner of Cafe Toscana, a really awesome Italian restaurant in Aurora is really a part of this new place they should go there for dinner one night and see the difference.   It did not help that our waitress had an attitude and an answer for all our complaints."}
{"text":"Food was super; service was fast, bright and cheerful until romance and sunset gives way to cozy lighting! Loved the Gluten free options !! Great date night or family friendly place."}
{"text":"I don't like righting negative reviews, because I get concerned with peoples jobs, but the purpose of Yelp is to be honest. To start I ordered a bowl of wedding soup for $6 which was a small bowl and the soup was a bit spiced unlike others I had. Maybe good for some people but not typical wedding soup, and I didn't like.  Next was the Siciliano Pizza and what I believe were supposed to be garlic knots that seemed stale and hard. The $10 plain pizza was ok size wise, but TERRIBLE. The pizza was nothing more than pizza dough (not good) with some sauce on it and a little sprinkle of Parmesan or maybe Romano on top.  Again very bad!   To top it all they weren't that busy and it took way too long to get my food. I heard the other two table complaining about the wait and they were there before me. If the food is good and a place is busy it's worth it, but in this case it was not.   I can't speak for other things on the menu and the one good thing was the fact I wasn't paying for it as I have an expense account"}
{"text":"Ravioli was really good.  Great bartender and service.  Decent wine selection for area."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, friendly service!  We have been here twice - the first time on a coupon that was through one of the val-pak type of distributors.  My husband is Italian, so we are always looking for local places to try. His acid test is the Ravioli.  His grandmother made them from scratch every day and them memory of them is still his gold standard for great Italian food.  He rates these 90% Nona, which is quite an honor - there's only been one other place we've tried that has gotten such a high rating and that was in Italy.  I had the Carbonara, which is done differently than I'd had it before, with no cheese in the sauce, just the butter and egg and a *mound* of pancetta and peas, served with a poached egg on top.  It looked (and tasted) so good that my husband had it when we came back on Tuesday night. He wasn't disappointed. Portions are HUGE, so you will have leftovers for lunch - maybe twice if you order something as rich as the Carbonara.  I opted for the Pappardelle Bolognese with peppers and onions on our second visit, and it was delish - I had to make myself stop eating.  My only concern is that the place was empty on Tuesday except for us - I guess everyone was waiting for Valentine's day, but I am really hoping that nothing happens to this place - it's terrific and we will be back often."}
{"text":"We have now been here twice.  Both times the service was perfect and the food wonderful.  My husband had the penne diablo and mother in law the pappardelle bolognese.  The second time we went back we took our nephew also he had a pepperoni and sausage pizza.  I had the spaghetti marinara.  All loved their food, couldn't get over the quality and taste of the meat.  The only downside was the marinara. It is rather plain.  When I go next I will try a veggie pizza.  The garlic knots were fabulous (they ate 3 bowls!) and the salads nice with a dressing not to tart or sweet.  My mother in law does not like to go to a restaurant where she has to spend too much to eat and the food was so good that she is bringing another nephew and his family when they come to visit.  Yes she already has it planned!  It was good.  I can't speak for the bar area, but in the restaurant our server was very helpful, packed everything up nicely and kept us in drink refills!  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Solon needs more restaurants like this one.  Our waitress Nina was great, she was attentive to all our needs. What a sweetheart as well. The eggplant Parmesan was right up there with the very best. Their Italian dressing is homemade and is very good.  The hostess after seating us told us about her homemade sweet potato pie, which I had to try. I Loved it!  They also have quality gluten-free pasta available.  I asked to see what they carried and Nina actually brought a bag of real imported Italian gluten-free pasta to show us. It seems they are a close knit operation. You can feel they all play a part in making it a restaurant that cares. My friend and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great Italian food- huge portions- beautiful dining room with a separate bar and large party room. White table cloths and candles on every table. Excellent homemade bread served as soon as we were seated. Very friendly and accommodating servers and staff. My husband and I both had the 12 layer lasagna and were very satisfied with it and the house salad (with homemade Italian dressing). Homemade cheesecake and other items were on the dessert menu, but we were too stuffed to try it. Mixed crowd of all ages joined us on a Saturday evening, but there wasn't a wait when we came in. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good rich food, very large portions and amazing table bread! Didn't even think about dessert but maybe next time."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and apparently this used to be called Belladonnas NOW called TUSCANOS.  The service was not exactly fast then the waitress apologized for them being a little behind but they were short handed   I had the Eggplant Parmigiana with Cavatelli   Pasta with marinara sauce, a house salad with Balsamic Glaze.  Never have I tasted anything that good before.  I mean you could actually taste the freshness of everything being home made    I would come back again in a heartbeat.  Oh portions very healthy."}
{"text":"Craving comfort food on a chilly night...We had the spaghetti marinara which was very good. The rolls had an amazing garlic Parmesan coating. The minestrone soup was excellent and the House salad was a nice compliment to the pasta. Pleasant atmosphere and our server graciously put up with our sense of humor. A great spot... we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the worst service we ever had! Good food but worst service! I cant even begin how to say how bad our experience."}
{"text":"If I could give less stars, I would. Very disorganized, unprofessional, and poor communication. I will not be back. Read on to see why.   I went with a friend that had a deal through small bites that offered her and her guests free appetizers and dinner up to $20. Before going to the restaurant, she confirmed with the staff there that she could use the deal. When we arrived, we were seated and ordered appetizers which came out in a timely fashion. Forty five minutes later, our waitress comes out and tells us that the person who received the small bites deal will be the only one with a free meal. After speaking with a manager, showing them the messages from the small bites deal and explaining that she confirmed the deal with restaurant staff, the best compromise they could offer was 50% off everyone's meal. We agreed and waited an additional 30 minutes until most of our food was brought out. We realized they did not put our orders in during that initial 45 minute waiting period. As a result, two people in our party were told they would have to order something different because they gave their meals away because they assumed once we learned we couldn't use the coupon, we would not want to have our meals. With a third person in our party, they completely forgot to make his food, so his food was brought out to him in a to-go container. Worst restaurant experience I have had in a very long time. If the food was phenomenal, I would consider giving them another chance, but it wasn't. I can find food that is just as good at a place with far better service. If this is a new business, I don't see them lasting too long."}
{"text":"Ate here with the family on St. Patty's Day (Italian to avoid the crowds). The ambiance was nice and cozy. We sat in the bar area which seemed more casual. Our server was very accommodating and had a great sense of humor. She also was able to make great recommendations which is always appreciated.   The garlic rolls served before the meal were good enough to warrant a return visit. Extremely buttery and cheesy but didn't feel too heavy.   I ordered the fruit de mar with the garlic sauce and a bowl of the minestrone. The soup paired perfectly with the rolls. The entree was full of flavor and I was very happy with the server's recommendation on this dish.   We paired our meals with a bottle of white wine and great conversation"}
{"text":"Not a great restaurant   Bad service, marginal food quality. Even when the Restaurant wasn't busy. Stop changing the name and change the service and food."}
{"text":"Alright, everyone, I'm back. With not much new news to report. Since I last wrote, Belladonna's has changed its name to Villa Tosacano and updated its hours. This was super interesting to me, so we decided to check it out again with a giant take out order. I'm a huge fan of updating reviews and adding a star, but sadly, this one stays the same for now.  Whenever I order a takeout, I usually just grab it and go. When you get a tightly wound bag of takeout, who actually takes the time to cut it open, look at it, then ask to have it re-bagged? Absolutely no one. I always just assume everything is in there and packaged well. Cue getting home-- and sadly, the food was so poorly wrapped, that everything was covered in grease, and there was more sauce in the bag than on the entrees. It was like opening a giant, big, wet mess, and all the entree sauces had run together to the point of literally needing to drain the bag. Don't get me wrong, Italian food *should* have a lot of sauce, but you can't enjoy it when it's not on your meal. Also, compared to other area places, the prices are actually more expensive for what you're getting.  So here's the thing: there might still be hope here, but i'm hesitant. I'm willing to give it *one* more in-person try. Something still isn't connecting with this place. But we shall see, maybe they can still get it together..."}
{"text":"Horrible if you are a bar person that likes to eat in the bar.  Been here for an hour. Nobody owns us, everyone disappears for 20+ minutes, and they don't want to wait on you.  Have asked 3 people for bread and they say it's coming. An hour later, no bread.  The ice machine is so loud that you can't hear yourself talk.  Nobody at hostess stand all night.   Got food, still no bread. Waitress says bread is still coming.  Asked for parm, she said ok, but whoops never came. Veal parm, not so good, but eatable.  Pizza super greasy but decent taste.  Took 40 minutes because they burnt it the first time according to waitress.  Oh, by the way, there is one large party in restaurant, 2 families in restaurant and us and 2 other couples in the bar. There are at least 4 servers we have seen. Not sure why Will not be back.  I predict 6 months till this place is gone.  Shared our concerns with original waitress...defensive and she's right.   Guess we will not be back.  Was hoping this was a place for my corporate gatherings...not a chance."}
{"text":"I'm never happy to provide a terrible review. The best part of this meal was the Hendricks Gin martini. The Bisquick bread was burnt ....seriously how does this happen. After waiting for our appetizer for 30 minutes, the waitress told us...\" it's crazy the chef burnt the calamari\". The salad came from a bag and lacked any flavor. Then...after 75 minutes the main course arrived. I ordered Chicken Piccata. Here is some hints for the chef ....don't boil the chicken in water then pour canned artichokes over the top.. That's all...headed to the bathroom for a while."}
{"text":"Really good spicy chicken Alfredo dish, House Italian dressing had good flavor and the bread is addicting."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had dinner here a handful of times, most recently tonight (with my parents). We all enjoyed the great food, friendly and helpful staff, and generous portions."}
{"text":"Worst carryout experience ever.  They messed up our office order once before but we gave them a 2nd chance because they were new. The second order arrived missing 4 items, one of them my Caesar salad. They brought the missing items within about a half an hour but neglected to bring any dressing for the Caeser salad. After scrounging around the office to find some dressing for my completely dry salad I finally settled in to eat only to discover with my teeth, a pebble sized rock among my romaine.  I threw the rest away.  Never again."}
{"text":"Yuk yuk this place already changed there name again no longer Belladonas. Very expensive for what it is food is  not good service terrible. I don't recommend."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Villa Toscano for my boyfriend's birthday. The service was great and the food was exceptional. You just can't beat their complimentary garlic rolls! So delicious. A couple of us had the Chicken Jobre (my favorite dish at the old Daddona's in Westlake) and one had the Cajun Cream Fettuccine. We all loved our food and have nothing but great things to say about our experience. Well worth the drive from Amherst and Elyria for us. Keep up the great work, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As a long-time fan of Jimmy Dadonna's I was hoping this restaurant would be just as good.  It wasn't even close.  The service was awful.  Took forever to get seated, order drinks and food, get water refills, etc (and only a few tables had customers).  The rolls were over-cooked and over-seasoned.  The chicken parm wasn't pounded thin as it should be and was over-cooked.  Also, the restaurant has two names according to the signs outside. Well, is it Belladonna's or is it Tuscano's?  Never going back."}
{"text":"We just had our first meal here. The portions were huge and our server was great. We enjoyed the caprese salad, Italian wedding soup, stuffed mushrooms, and shared the Pappardelle Bolognese. It was wonderful and we will be back!"}
