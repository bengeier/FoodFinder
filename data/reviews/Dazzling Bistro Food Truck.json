{"text":"Shrimp tacos are awesome.  I have them almost every tuesday when they are on Decatur over by the Nevada SPCA. Duck proscuitto pannini was delicious this week.  Chef Darnell is always so friendly and knows your name after the first time."}
{"text":"Thank you, Chef Darnell. The crab Mac-n-cheese was scrumptious. Absolutely delish! The chocolate mousse with Srirachi was a revelation but the white chocolate version blew me away. What a perfect dessert! You can't find a nicer chef on four wheels! This truck is AMAZING! Wish I lived closer and could eat at this truck weekly!"}
{"text":"Everything I've ordered has been top notch cuisine. Chef Darnell always makes you feel warm and welcome."}
{"text":"There are only a few guarantees in life, one of which is that 95% of restaurants will overcook your shrimp.  Not these guys.  Their shrimp po'boy is perfection.  The perfect amount of sauce and spice, along with a ton of big, juicy, perfectly-cooked shrimp.  Can't wait to eat here again so I can try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this food!! Chef Darnell and staff are very professional and friendly. Fresh ingredients, fast service and AWESOME food! I HIGHLY recommend this truck to EVERYONE!!! I must say that I'm a little addicted to the White Chocolate Mousse with a hint of Sriracha sauce.....DELISH!!! I had also has the 2 way duck tacos and they were DELISH!! I tasted the panini and the meatballs (my co-workers were so kind to share) and you just can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I 'm looking forward to seeing them once a week. A great twist on Comfort food and it wasn't heavy on me at all. LOVE LOVE LOVE THE DAZZLING BISTRO!!!!!

Thank you Chef Darnell!!!"}
{"text":"Chef Darnell is the epitome of professionalism. We booked Dazzling Bistro for our engagement party and we could not have asked for a better experience! Not only was Chef Darnell on time for our event, dressed to impress in his chefs jacket, interacting with the crowd and even took pictures with us for our wedding album... He invited us to several events before hand to be able to try the different menu items, took a special order for my Fianc√© for the night of our event and had that prepared first and he comped our meal when we had our consultation. 
We would recommend Dazzling Bistro to any and everyone! All of our guests were so happy with the food and the service, plus we all had so much fun just experiencing having a food truck! 
We will use Dazzling Bistro again and again! Don't hesitate to use Dazzling Bistro Food Truck for your next event!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Way beyond the usual food truck fare! Chef Darnell is passionate about his menu, and it shows. Hard to say what is more enjoyable--the food or Chef Darnell's descriptions! Everything is tasty! No disappointments here--except that the truck is in our neighborhood only once a week! Get on the menu email list and plan ahead. Well worth seeking out!"}
{"text":"Went to a play this weekend and this food truck was out front. I was a little hungry so decided to indulge in their eats. I wasn't expecting much from a food truck, but wow! Was I surprised!! I had the BBQ pork quesadilla and my girlfriend had their BLT. We couldn't believe how good it was. Service was friendly and great, truck was clean and the food was amazing. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I was outside of my office yesterday morning, when I notice the Dazzling Bistro food truck in the office lot next door to ours. I asked if they were there for a private party. 
I asked and to my surprise they were there for the lunch crowd. 
I went over on my way to a client meeting. 
I was able to meet Chef Darnell, and he is so charming. He took the time to tell me about each menu item. 
I did not have a lot of time, and went with the grilled cheese with banana jam. 
It was fantastic, it came with a kale salad which was also delicious. 
The truck will be there each Tuesday. I am looking forward to next Tuesday when I can try the duck tacos."}
{"text":"Horrible service, I was standing in front of the food truck waiting for my food, the chef grabbed 3 other orders and preceded into the brewery. But when his assistant asked \"what about Mary?\" he replied \"I don't know where she is\", and I was standing right in front of him because they told me to just wait by the truck and then told the rest of the customers that they would bring their food inside to them. He then came into the brewery and started to yell out peoples names.....he didn't know where they were sitting either so why couldn't he grab my order? It was ready way before the other customers but he just let it sit there and left it when he went to bring out the rest of the orders....I wonder how that works for customer service."}
{"text":"9.20.17 6:30pm Supporting our local & family owned businesses all at one time!  A fantastic food truck, Chef Darrell & a fantastic location, Khoury's liquor store.  Issa, at Khoury's said that the Dazzling Bistro Food Truck comes by a couple times a month.  Good to know cause I'd really like to try more like the Gumbo & Rice bowls I read about.  

My friend & I first grabbed a six-pack of Franziskaner Hefeweizen which paired well w/ Chef Darrell's creations.  

Our order was slightly mixed up, but no problem, Chef brought us an Old Bay seasoned, Spicy Shrimp Taco.  It said w/ Blue Chips, but it came w/ a salad & all three items we got were on a Hoagie Roll.  It worked well as a sandwich, instead of a taco too.  We took off one bun from each order & then could really taste the elements of each sandwich.  I loved this spicy shrimp & slaw creation!  It had a nice kick of Sriracha & garlic aioli which I love!

The Thai Style Beef Satay Tri-Tip was a strip of Beef Satay On a Hoagie topped w/ a nice sweet cucumber, carrot salad.  I really liked the sweet sauce on top of it & it would also be great as a salad!  

My fav was the Smoked Pork Belly Banh Mi On a Hoagie, topped w/ coleslaw & pickled onions & cilantro!  I should've taken one to-go so will have to hope that it's on the menu next time.  If not, I am very excited to try what is on the menu next time this Dazzling Bistro Food Truck is at Khoury's.  Thank you Chef.  I love spicy, it was a wonderful experience & very tasty creations."}
{"text":"Dazzeling Bistro Food Truck serves healthy and taste you food., I love  Darnell and the rest of the chefs are very pleasent. My favorite is the Po Boy Shrimp sandwich and salad with just a hint of his special dressing. Dazzling  Bistro is the best."}
{"text":"Very good food. My friends and I gave this a try and everything is wonderful. Darnell is awesome and the spice on my shrimp sandwich was perfect. Best Food truck experience ever. Chef Darnell is really down to earth and fun to talk with. Wish him the best with this diamond of a business."}
{"text":"Probably THE best food tuck I've eaten food from! Always they have over the top flavor combinations. Combos you wouldn't even think would work, and they taste fantastic. Tonight at Tenaya Creek I had the Garam Marsala Chicken Quesadilla,  holy mackerel, it's fantastic. You know, I don't think I've ever had a bad dish from them. 5 Stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Dazzling Bistro is awesome. Their food is spectacular and they are an awesome crew.  Chef Darnell is outgoing and we just love eating there."}
{"text":"I just stopped down at the Small Business Vendor Event on Water Street and saw two food trucks. At first I was going to eat at the first one, but when I saw this menu I was blown away. The chef that was taking orders was very knowledgeable and helped my husband navigate his food allergies. I had the Grilled Cheese (four cheeses) with the banana jalepeno jam. It was hands down the best grilled cheese I have ever had. I will actively seek this grilled cheese out in the future. If you haven't been, look for them out and about. They also said they do events. It was just so delicious. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"If you love a savory bowl full of sweetness then the Thai coconut curry bowl is for you. The flavor is spot on and the portion size is perfect. Chef Darnell is nothing but amazing, always with a big smile on his face. He has brought a high end culinary experience to the food truck business."}
{"text":"My company had an Open House event that I was asked to research and hire a lunch caterer for.  Chef Darnell and the Dazzling Bistro Food Truck is who I selected and I could not have been happier.

Menu planning was a breeze.  I could not WAIT for them to get here that day.  Had I known just how amazing the food was going to be ahead of time - I would have been even more excited!

They arrived on time and set up - and then the magic happened.  Beautiful plates of food started appearing out of this truck.  EVERYONE at the event loved the food.  I did not hear even one negative comment.  I personally had a brisket slider that was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. 

If I could - I would stalk this food truck to all of his events.  That's how amazing this was. 

For dessert we'd planned a white peach cobbler.  All of the piglets that work in my shop snarfed up all of the peaches before I could get one.  I must have looked crestfallen when Chef Darnell told me, because a week after our event he showed up with a serving of peach cobbler and a plate of pork sliders.  The look of sheer envy on the face of the shop guys as I waltzed by with my surprise lunch was totally worth the week's wait.

If you are looking to hire catering for an event,  DO NOT hesitate - this is your go-to.  We will meet again, Chef Darnell.  I look forward to our tasty reunion!"}
{"text":"We were at Khoury's and checked out the menu for this food truck. Apparently they change the menu around depending on where they're at. The service was very friendly and the food came out pretty fast. We both ordered the philly cheese steaks and the bread was awesome. Perfect food after a couple beers. The only thing that threw me off a bit sad how the meat was cut. It was cut into strips reminiscent of Asian stir fry and it was a little fatty but overall very good."}
{"text":"We have been fans of Darnell Harness, the chef from Dazzling Bistro, for several months now.  I therefore turned to Darnell as I was to host a pre-family reunion reception dinner at our home and I needed a high quality caterer. I had about 58 family members, all with different food preferences. Darnell took great care to provide menu options and to explain the importance of offering light small plates in the context of very hot weather and the possibility that some may be swimming and may need to avoid heavy meals. 
There were indonesian pork satays with a very creative non-peanut sauce, which were the best I have ever had. We enjoyed mini chicken cashew sliders on olive buns. There was a grilled corn and crab salad with raspberries, some portobello sandwiches with provolone on the most dreamy brioche bun, marinated green bean salad with toasted sesame, and macerated seasonal berries with basil and mint which were cool and refreshing.  I am telling you that all of my family members, barring none, approached me to explain how much they loved the different foods. Some of these individuals have extremely high expectations and it was so gratifying to have others recognize what I have known for a while now: Darnell is truly gifted. Darnell delivered a platter of food at a time, so that individuals who arrived early could get started, and the amount of food was incredible. We would completely recommend Darnell¬¥s talent and his team for your next event.  It was outstanding service!!"}
{"text":"This food truck is probably the best food truck I've ever had! The Philly cheese steak is out of this world! The staff is absolutely incredible! If you haven't tried this food you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Dazzling Bistro! I had an order of the spicy shrimp tacos and they were soooooo good! I had no idea it also came with chips and pico de gallo which made it even more valuable of a meal. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and had so much flavor!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! I got the Thai coconut curry chicken bowl and the chocolate sriracha mousse. Loved how the flavors blended! Chef Darnel is a true artist with food!"}
{"text":"Dazzling offers high quality, 5 Star delicacies from a truck.   To accompany the amazing food is a jubilant owner and Chef Darnell.  It's as if you not only get a great meal but you make a great friend.

His menu changes often, but if you can find them, I highly recommend the Philly, Po Boy, and the chicken quesadilla.  Just by those selections you can see the menu has items from all over the culinary spectrum. 

I have dined with Dazzling twice now and both experiences were amazing."}
{"text":"I found Dazzling Bistro truck today so I had to pull over and give it a try even though I wasn't that hungry!!
It was smelling so good all around the truck like Cajun spicy scent. The smell made me hungry and I was ready to eat.
Chef Darnell is such a fun person to talk to. Everyone around the truck was enjoying conversation with him. He said they change menus for occasions. He's from Louisiana so Cajun food is what he's specialized in.
Everything on the menu looked good but chef Darnell recommended Southwest Chicken Tacos so I decided to try that.
The food came out pretty quick.
My Southwest Chicken Taco was delicious!! The chicken was peppery spicy and coleslaw inside was crisp, not overly mayonnaised. 
It was $9.99 but the portion wasn't big. 
They are on Roaming Hunger so it's easier to spot them.
If I can find Dazzling Bistro truck again, I would definitely stop by ;-)"}
{"text":"Chef Darnell's play on elevated comfort food was well executed.  His new concept brings together fresh quality handmade ingredients that are well balanced in flavor.  You will not find any pre-frozen, save a buck food coming off of this truck.  I sampled 1 of everything off of the menu today with my wife. The 2 way duck tacos, meatballs, grilled cheese with jalape√±o banana jam, crab mac and cheese we're awesome. I also liked that tacos came with chips and both the grilled cheese and mac and cheese were accompanied by a fresh crisp salad with a brite fantastic tasting dressing.  The price was well worth it and the Chef and his crew were very professional.  Thanks for the new experience!!! I highly recommend this truck....."}
{"text":"Yummy! So good! Get the philly or the quesadilla or the po boy! Chef Darnel cares about what he is serving, you can't go wrong with anything he serves. High quality food that you wouldn't expect from a good truck"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Had the best short rib tacos. They are serving the Cinco de Mayo menu. So yummy. The salsas are the type you would get in a fancy 5 star international restaurant. Chef Darnell is the owner and has a passion that shows in his food. Follow these guys. You will not be sorry with the every changing menu and fancy food at reasonable prices.  Dazzling Bistro is truly DAZZLING!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! I had the Sinful Grilled Cheese! It was amazing!!!! I also tasted a little of the duck meat which i was a little scared to try but that was also delicious!!! And the white chocolate mousse!!!!"}
{"text":"I was curious after seeing the 5 star review as to whether this was truly a diamond in the rough. Well, they're definitely polished.

Dazzling Bistro was one of many local food trucks at the 4th annual run of Sunset Park'd, and my friends and I walked up near the end of our busy lunch session. They have a somewhat eclectic menu that draws inspiration from several regions and countries (and doesn't misspell \"banh mi\"). It looks like they often (or always) change up their menu; had I known, I would've tried to find stomach space for more food.

However, I just went along with my friend and tried some of his order. The \"Thai\" Coconut Curry Chicken Rice Bowl ($9.99) didn't resemble any Thai curry that I've had (and it wasn't spicy in the least), but there was certainly a strong yet balanced coconut milk flavor. The chicken was exceptionally well-treated, marinated and grilled, thinly sliced but still moist and tender, and present in sufficient quantity for every bite. The onions and red bell peppers were  delicious. I wasn't expecting a chef working out of a food truck to care so much about the chicken, which is normally a dull protein.

After this brief experience, I'm really looking forward to trying more of Dazzling Bistro's creations. I'll definitely have more room in my belly next time, so my fingers are crossed that they come back soon to Henderson or to nearby parts of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"F... That's delicious!!!! there are few things in life that bring me as much joy this   po boy. Friendly and convenient! I wish this food truck was outside every place. Yum yum city"}
{"text":"Chef Darnell has created a food truck that has fresh and 5 star food in a food truck.   This is your mom's homemade food truck. The duck panini is amazing.  The braised short ribs are also wonderful.  I suggest you keep your eyes open or look for them in Facebook."}
{"text":"I went to an event tonight and they had the food truck set up outside. I have had many food truck meals and this was by far the most AMAZING meal I've had EVER!!  The food was so fresh and delicious! I will definitely be back for more! Chef Darnell was so sweet and funny and made my family and I feel welcomed and like we have been friends for years! He talked about his business I could tell he really takes pride in his business and his food! I can't say anything about good things about them!"}
{"text":"Chef Darnell's Shrimp Tacos are the bomb diggity!!!!! I look forward to the Dazzling Bistro every Friday at the VA. Chef Darnell is so entertaining. I have renewed fondness of food trucks. Everyone must try the Pana Cotta as well."}
{"text":"Chef Darnell's food is guaranteed delicious and his positive energy is practically contagious!  Super nice guy with a menu he can tailor to your event. You can catch him a few times a month at Khoury's Fine Wine & Spirits!"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing! Fresh ingredients, great recipes, and superior food service! Do yourself a favor and get a meal from these wheels!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this food truck. Chef Darnell and his group and veer friendly. The food is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"After knowing subway uses a chemical for trot bred who is also used to make yoga matts!
My yoga Matt is great best quality I just picture a bagget in a yoga Matt with probably nasty chicken, I had an amazing lunch , I'm a picky eater they had great food , I only had 30 mins to eat! 
Yet it is so good!"}
{"text":"I just left the Dazzling Bistro food truck outside The Velveteen Rabbit. I will admit that my fianc√© and I just wanted dinner and a cocktail and after the week I have had, nothing fancy. We tried everything on the menu and were happy with all choices. I'm from Louisiana and certainly value well seasoned food and fresh ingredients. Dazzling Bistro did not disappoint. The shrimp was perfectly cooked, the beef was tender, and the soup warmed me up! Aside from the food, the staff, including Chef Darnell, was genuinely inviting. I would not hesitate to seek out this truck again, even if just to chat with these guys! Thank you for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Chef and his crew come by our VA facility once a week and we all eagerly anticipate his arrival.  Chef is ALL about customer service! His Shrimp Poboy and Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches are my favorites, but he always has a variety of delicious choices to keep my palate well rounded. I enjoy the conversations I have with Chef as much as his menu, and he always entertains and enlightens us.  Chef, one of these days I promise to show you my pics from the Valley of Fire!  You and your crew are awesome sauce! 
-Jim-"}
{"text":"Love this food and Chef Darnell is the best!  What a creative, sweet and personable man.  I had the chicken curry bowl and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"The office staff had heard about the food truck and decided to give it a try.  Oh my goodness what a pleasant surprise. The shrimp tacos...pork sliders..spaghetti and meatballs all were given 5 stars. The service is very friendly and noticed several people visiting the truck who were obviously regulars.  If you have a chance give them a try. Delicious!"}
