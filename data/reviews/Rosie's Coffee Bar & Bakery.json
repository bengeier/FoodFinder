{"text":"I really want to like this place! We keep trying (because of the madison.com deals) and enjoy the donuts for the madison.com price, but there's a lot left to be desired. The interior feels cold and unwelcoming and the food is fine but not particularly memorable. Free refills should be a thing (booths and layout say \"diner\"). And the service is not particularly warm. Still hoping this place can turn it around."}
{"text":"Rosie's looks like it has potential.  Unfortunately, for now, that potential is unrealized.  It's a great location, and Monona certainly needs more variety, so hopefully they'll draw enough business that they can stick around a while and get it right.  

As it stands now, the decor is fairly antiseptic.  It could be warm and inviting, but, it's so sterile it lacks charm.  I'm not suggesting that the place be cluttered with kitsch, but a little less sterility would be nice.  How about a little more art?  Maybe some music?  The wide open room, while good in many situations, starts to feel like a cold cafeteria when paired with the tile floor.  The chalkboard menu signs help \"liven\" it up, but are so overdone, they're becoming a cliche.  It gives it a \"Pier 1\" feel - which is confusing when contrasted against the overabundance of tile and white wall.  The effect is that it feels like a facade.  

Wish I could say I liked the food, but, I haven't been able to try it!  I was hoping for brunch.  When I walked in at 11:10, I was informed that they stopped serving breakfast at 11:00.  Doesn't it seem a little odd that a cafe would stop serving breakfast at any time?  Anyone who has worked in kitchens for any length of time knows that breakfast is the easiest meal to make - if it's a money maker, why would you stop?  

Even if you did, for whatever reason, decide to stop serving breakfast, why would you not make an exception for someone who walked in 10 minutes after the \"official cutoff\" time?  At the very least, why not try and find a way to be accommodating.  If option A doesn't work, let's do option B! Let's find a way to make it work!

I was even told that, while I could still get the quiche, I wouldn't be able to get potatoes with it.  I'd have to get the salad.  (Nothing says yum like cold salad in the winter).  Now, we all know that those potatoes are at least partially cooked, sitting in the back, waiting for a last minute warm-up.  But, I guess they must throw them all out when the clock hits 11:00.  Strange... but rules is rules!  

And, I guess that last statement sums up the feel of it.  There's potential, but right now, there's an awkward stuffiness that makes the experience uncomfortable.  As the group left, and Rosie's lost out on what was easily a $70 breakfast, the host had a look of confused anger, which made me feel a little awkward.  Guy - I've worked in the industry - and let me tell you, it's a tough industry to be in.  If you're going to make it, you've got to learn to work with people.  And smiling helps too."}
{"text":"Coffee easily as good as the other very fancy pour-over places but comes up in a fraction of the time. You can tell they take pride in food/drinks they make. Refreshingly low on the irony factor beloved of its Isthmus peers, too."}
{"text":"Their spicy ginger chai tea latte is incredible. Friendly staff, lots of pastry and lunch options too!"}
{"text":"Well I will start by saying we will never come back. I called and talked with an employee about a funny cake for my sister's 30th birthday. I was so excited. I told all my coworkers about it and they were excited to see it as well. I thought the price was a little high but worth it for this one time cake. I picked it up today and it was nothing like we discussed. It had a tiny decoration and some writing. I am furious. It is just a plain cake now for a ridiculous price. I will never return. I will let my coworkers know not to order a cake from here. What a disappointing experience.  If the employee I picked it up from hadn't been so nice I probably would have left it and walked out."}
{"text":"I like my coffee. My morning cup has saved more lives than Kevlar. I need a cup of joe strong enough enough to stimulate the brain and get my fat arse in motion. It's medicinal, not artisanal. Fine coffee is lost on my somnolent state. As such, I've been searching for someone who will do me a long pull espresso. A Lungo, or Café Allongé for those of you who haven't already wiki'd that bitch. An extraction method that produces a very bitter, highly caffeinated brew that tastes awesome done up breve. Unfortunately for me, the advent of computerized barristas have had me coming up goose egg around Madison. (at least as far as my convenient options went. Yes Bradbury's, I am talking about you). Salvation arrived in the form of Rosie's Coffee bar and a lady named Coz who, earlier this week, finally managed to make a coffee drink I've been trying to get someone to make for me for the last decade. I wouldn't say that coffee was strong but it actually attempted to shiv Coz as she passed it over the counter. This is a place that is determined to do it right. I love that idea and I love Rosie's from the first time I walked through the door. Now please don't tell anyone else about it, let's just keep between us. I don't want to fight for tables and strongly suspect that is inevitable. Go now while the rest of Madison is still still in the dark."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by some of the bad reviews.  I've only been here twice, but both times were great.  Here are my highlights.

Service - I had courteous, quick service both times. 

Food - I had coffee both times. Once I had a donut and another time,  a cupcake.  The coffee is good.  I got a nitro cold brew last time and it was yummy.  The donuts are fabulous!  They are very fancy, more like french pastry than a typical donut. The cupcake was just ok.

Atmosphere - the space is nothing special, but I think they did a good job with what they have.  

Cost - no surprises here.  Exactly what you would expect.  Less than $5 for a cold press and donut."}
{"text":"I love going to Rosie's.  The people are so friendly, the bakery is from scratch of highest quality, and the coffee is fantastic....you can't find a better place for the coffee  connoisseur.   I'm a fan of the vanilla cafe latte.    Feel good...go to Rosies!"}
{"text":"Such a lovely place! My daughter and I have been going to area coffee shops and stopped here today. We were expecting coffee only and were quite surprised at the delicious menu. All of the baked good are made from scratch (fabulous cinnamon roll) and the coffee was awesome!  I had the pear and goat cheese sandwich and it was very very good!"}
{"text":"The owner is sort of a dick in the wee hours of the morning, but the coffee and donuts are the best I've had. Service/general attitude from the employees is polite and more than satisfactory."}
{"text":"I stopped in for donuts and a lattee and I have to say the service at kwik trip was better and faster.  The guy behind the counter was on his cell phone when I walked in and seemed a bit annoyed when I wanted to be helped.  
I got a few donuts  and a lattee to go.  They weren't busy at all yet it still took about 10 minutes to get my lattee.
The lattee was okay, nothing special.  The donuts however were not that good.  They looked a little sloppy and tasted greasy and day old.
I did though look at the breakfast and lunch menu and they sounded tasty.  I will be back to try something else but will probably stay away from the donuts and just have water with my meal."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a visit to Rosie's. Bright, cheerful setting, good food and friendly folks. Today I sat at the coffee bar and asked for a plate of Biscuits & Gravy.  Really good, hearty breakfast for a chilly spring morning. I also asked Andy, the Barista, to make a siphon brew of fresh coffee. I had seen them before at Rosie's, but never tried it before.  Wow!  Now I have been called a coffee snob - I grind my own beans in the morning and use a French press, but this is a new and interesting way to brew coffee.  Precise measurement, exact temperature control and entertaining to watch as Andy described the process.  And the result was like no other cup of coffee.  Full of flavor and great aroma.  This could become a habit for me.  I have got to introduce this to the Mrs.  She will love it.  And so will anyone else.  Nice job, Andy.  Oh, and I always enjoy a great conversation with Coz, the lovely, hard-working owner."}
{"text":"Great donuts but a breakfast/brunch/coffee place that isn't open on Sunday? Seriously? Would get five stars if they were open for Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"First visit yesterday 
Outstanding corn chowder and excellent over pour cup of coffee! Friendly staff that aims to serve in an warm and welcoming atmosphere...definitely looking forward to returning and becoming a regular...gotta try some of those delicious looking desserts next time."}
{"text":"I like Rosie's. Service is definitely hit or miss here and the layout is a little confusing. However, they serve JBC coffee and have some amazingly delicious raised and glazed donuts that keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"We stopped at this café today for lunch because we had a coupon deal. We were not very impressed. We placed our order and were told they would bring the drinks out first but we never got them. My husband had to ask for his iced tea when the food arrived. He had the \"Harvey Ham\" that came with kettle chips, pasta salad or a green salad. He got 4 pieces of a sandwich that were not very big and a little lacking in ham. The price was $8.95. I ordered the \"Rick's Roast Beef.\" I received just 2 halves with not much beef. It also came with kettle chips, pasta salad or a green salad. This sandwich was $9.95 and not worth that price. We both chose the pasta salad which was okay-nothing spectacular. We felt the sandwiches both were lacking in the amount of meat used. His tea was $3.29. We felt this was a pretty pricey lunch for what we got. They are a bakery also but we didn't try any of the baked goods. There is a coffee bar also but we weren't interested in that. In short, would not return for the prices they charged."}
{"text":"Nearly $6.50 for a 16 oz nitro brew?! WTF? Are they trying to make customers cover their rent? Talk about price gouging. I've been here before. Food and pastries are nothing special. Place is usually half empty. I gave up on this place a while back, after waiting, no exaggeration, 15 minutes for a regular coffee. I thought I'd give another chance today, but what a fail. I don't recall the nitro brew costing so much. When I said this, the girl at the register had the audacity to suggest I didn't know what I was talking about. What a waste of a storefront."}
{"text":"Just had the best scone of my life here. Lemon blueberry - fresh, soft, flavorful, and with some amazing glaze. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"A quite clean and friendly place. Good coffee and their cinnamon rolls are great in flavor and very big!"}
{"text":"If there is one thing they are great at, let it be the cinnamon rolls! To die for :)

Love the coffee bar, so creative to use the space this way.

People are friendly and you're supporting a local business owned by a woman! Way to go Rosie's!!!"}
{"text":"Great new place on Monona Drive! My partner loved the asparagus soup and bread with herbed butter. Iced coffee was a little weak. Overall, great ambiance with plenty of outlets to plug in for free wifi. Loved the booths, bathroom was clean, service was excellent."}
{"text":"Raised Glazed donut was wonderful & my latte was excellent. The staff are friendly, & the place is clean. I'm looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Here is a place that is friendly has phenomenal attention to all they do, and is of great value to the Monona drive area.  I had the raised and glazed donut and a cup of individually brewed coffee.  It was the highest quality cup of coffee I, personally, have ever had!  Oh happy day!  The atmosphere is welcoming, comfortable all that you could want."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way out of town. The pastries were exceptional and the cold brew was great!"}
{"text":"Ummm...not impressed. I came after a big workout for some easy carbs and left super disappointed. The doughnuts at this place were highly recommended but it just didn't hit the mark for me. The doughnut doesn't only look like it was at least a day old but it tastes that way too. There is definitely an aftertaste of oil as well. I haven't tried anything else at Rosie's, so this review is based solely on the doughnut I tried. I'll be back to try more food when I have more time, but probably won't be having the doughnuts again."}
{"text":"Maybe this trip was a one-off, but it was not good either way.  I really wanted to like this place.  Small, non-corporate coffee shop?  Okay!  I got there around 6:50 AM and didn't leave with my drink until 7:15 AM.  There were two other customers there.
Apparently, their barista doesn't come in until after 7?  You open at 6:30 and all you have staffed is a cashier who doesn't know how to make drinks, why would your barista not come in until later?  Then, when your barista does show up, they make one drink at a time, one step at a time.  I've worked in a coffee shop before, it's possible to make two drinks at a time, and it's possible to froth the milk and pour the espresso at the same time.
They have i-pads to pay on.  The barista's wasn't working and they spent 5 minutes just trying to figure that out before deciding that we should pay at the cashier's i-pad.  
They also apparently don't stock their lids well and it took another few minutes just for them to find a lid for my Vanilla Iced Chai.  Which didn't taste great enough to make up for the wait. 
The saving grace for this place was the cake donut I got.  Really tasty and helped make up for the bad start to my morning.
All I can say is I'm lucky my job is flexible with when I start work.  I'll go back for a donut.  But not for coffee."}
{"text":"Dark brew coffee was lovely. Glazed, raised doughnut was on par with PDQ doughnuts. I did not finish the cloying maple, (neon) blueberry cake doughnut. Overall disappointed with the Bakery but appreciated the coffee \"bar.\" (Although that was confusing. Weird inorganic layout.)"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday breakfast 1) because I had a Groupon and 2) because my grandma who passed away last year's name was Rosie.  So I thought it would be neat to include her on my birthday and this is how I did it!

This is a cute little diner/coffee shop that doesn't really stand out as anything special/fancy, but I am glad I discovered it.

The inside seems like it may need a little facelift, but, perhaps, that's part of the charm.

The lady at the counter was very patient and helpful with us, since it was our first time and we weren't sure how the ordering/seating worked.  

We really enjoyed the food.  I ordered the chicken, bacon, ranch sandwich (yes, I know I said this was my birthday breakfast, but I was not in the mood for breakfast food at this point) and my boyfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy.  Lots of flavor in both.  My chicken was nice and tender with no signs of dryness.

Next time we stop in, I'd love to try their pastries!  It looks like they also do specialty cakes and desserts; so, I may have to look into that for any special events I have on the horizon.

Will be back to try some other menu items and dig into some desserts!"}
{"text":"Just picked up 2 dozen incredibly fresh donuts. First time here. They didn't mind at all that I practically cleaned them out! They still only charged me a dollar per donut even tho they added in some top shelfers!! I ate the maple bacon bar. It has now become my favorite donut I've ever eaten in my entire life! I just wish I had taken a picture before inhaling it. So soft, fluffy, chewy and not too terribly sweet either! I shared them with my coworkers and everyone is raving. Good job Rosie's! Super nice staff too! Such a cute place. I will be back."}
{"text":"First time here. Not appetizing. Up charged without being told. Make sure you ask if the option your given is extra. Coffee was terrible. Picture of sausage and biscuits. This is the least appetizing biscuits and gravy I've ever been served. Prices high for what you get. The bakery case has water condensing on display case, made pastries unappetizing. Also, an odor of like burning machine grease when I first came in."}
{"text":"Stopped at this place hoping to get a nice roll for burgers because it's a bakery, not. This is a nice coffee bar/bakery but it's not a full bakery because there was no bread or rolls, it's all sweet stuff like cakes, cookies, donuts, huge ass cinnamon rolls etc.

The place is very nice with the money shot cases as you walk in with the coffe bar on the left and a small dining area on the right. This is a nice place to stop for a coffee and a sweet something for sure and relax a while. While we didn't see any bread or rolls on display and it's possible if there was any it was sold out by lunch time but I doubt it.

I will admit that the place is nice for what it is but I'm disappointed that they call them self a bakery and have no great bread or roll options."}
{"text":"This bakery has simply the best cinnamon rolls in the entire city! Made from scratch every morning, they are a delight slightly warmed up eating fresh in the bakery. I am a baker and consider myself an aficionado of bakeries in town and this was a delightful surprise"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but I just cant do it yet. 

The good:
1. The donuts are good. My kids really love them. They are not too picky. 
2. The breakfast sandwich is my favorite food item on the menu and for those with picky kids, you can order it deconstructed which is great. 
3. The coffee is very good and for the coffee nerds out there, you will find a good home here. 

The not so good:
1. The layout is confused. When you walk in you see donuts and then you go one way for coffee and the other towards the primary dining area. It feels like two places in one but it isn't. 
2. The service is very mixed. 
3. The cafe side feels like a diner and when I get a coffee in that context my experience tells me I will get free refills. That is not the case."}
{"text":"Rosie's makes the best doughnuts I have ever enjoyed. I travel quite often for work and their doughnuts are worth a trip every time I'm in Madison. They always blow me away with the texture, flavor, and sheer quality of product. FANTASTIC!! The espresso is pretty awesome as well. 

EAT A ROSIE'S DOUGHNUT AND YOUR DAY WILL BE BETTER."}
{"text":"I was excited for bakery and there wasn't much left, maybe because it is good, idk. I was disappointed with service and place smelled very musty. I left without anyone asking me if I needed anything and as I stood there, I decided I wasn't going to stay anyway because of the smell. Sorry. I will not go back unless I hear of change."}
{"text":"I enjoy Rosie's baked goodies. The first time I ever stopped in, my cousin and I were just sliding in before close to feed our sugar cravings, and the really awesome person behind the counter let us have extras for an awesome discount (on top of their already great prices). The food is okay, it's pretty basic, and it lacks a bit of a 'wow' factor, but their baked goods are delicious. Since my initial visit with my friend, some of the staff seem a bit irritable, which is a little unwelcoming for a return.

Overall, I would definitely stop in for baked goodies, but limit my time and interaction with the staff."}
{"text":"Nice but pricey.  Wanted quiche but didn't want to pay $8.  Don't mind paying for a coffee refill since I know that I'll have to up front but the first cup is like $2.50?  I'm thinking a chip for a refill given to you when you order might be a nice thing.  I guess I never realized the coffee price since I was always ordering for multiple folks in the past.  My sausage / egg / cheddar breakfast sandwich on a biscuit was very good though.  Went at 7:15 on a Saturday morning this time.  Very mellow."}
{"text":"Okay. .  This is another of those places that I truly want to love.  Their cinnamon rolls are goofey and yummy.  Their donuts are pretty great... I like their quiche, but not quite as much as the ones I make at home and  tlat $9 a slice they are a little pricey, and typically not too imaginative.  Furthermore, their layout is more than a little confused and you aren't actually able to order coffee at their coffee bar and when you do they are typically 2 to 3 times then price of Java Cat's just down the road for similar price.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Hidden gem right out in the open! Very friendly! Tons of coffee options, espresso drinks, pour overs, etc. Serving local JBC coffee. The pastries are not like any I've found in Madison. All made in house. I love scones, think i had the best scone I've eaten: blueberry/lemmon! 

Lot's of seating options: coffee bar, booths and soft seating. Great to study or with a small group.

My new favorite coffee shop!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I would definitely come back for coffee because my horchata latte with almond milk was amazing but my lunch was disappointing. I ordered the smokys beef in their gluten free wrap. It was supposed to have roasted red peppers and pepperjack but there were no peppers to be found and provolone instead of pepperjack. The reason i picked that sandwich was because of the 2 things it happened to be missing. So the wrap was just ok...pretty lackluster. Andy had the breakfast sandwich with bacon which he said had good flavor but the croissant was soggy from the greasy eggs. So all in all we'll be back for the coffee but not the food"}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place a glowing 5-star review. But after several visits, I just can't. The place is kind of a mess, to be honest. I'm a little shocked by all of the love it's getting on Yelp. Perhaps I've just gone on the wrong days, and missed it's normal greatness.

The layout of Rosie's is confusing and awful. The first thing you see when you walk in is not a sign of what they offer. You don't see a smiling face. You see the desserts. Not that there is anything wrong with baked goods, but it's awkward. And then you are given a choice to walk left to the coffee bar or go right to the food/bakery area. I believe you can also order smoothies and fancy coffee drinks at the coffee bar. But who and where you pay or where you go for certain things is confusing. Their sloppily hand-written (in chalk!) signs are also unpleasant to look at and look unprofessional.

The pour-over coffee (that you can order on the left side) is fantastic. They do a nice job with the coffee, no doubt. But they go way too far in explaining all of the accolades the coffee has collected. Server, I don't care how may awards the coffee has won, calm down and go get me my coffee. I'm not even sure if you can order pour-over coffee at your table, or if you have to go to the bar and order it. There is batch coffee offered over to the right side.

I wanted to try the Biscuits & Gravy that others have liked, but they were sold out the last time I went. My roommate and I shared two sandwiches and both were mediocre. Not exactly sure what made my turkey sandwich \"tuscan\", but it was not very good. The quality of the meat was also questionable and did not appear to be the greatest. The pasta salad that came with my sandwich was flavorless and mushy. My ginger chai latte was fine, but had a lot of clumps of cinnamon in it, which made is somewhat unpleasant to drink.

It's also difficult to even find the place, due to poor signage. You've likely driven by Rosie's and never even noticed. 

The donuts were good. I'd order them again.

What I'd recommend is walking in and sitting at the coffee bar. Order some delicious pour-over coffee that they will repeatedly tell you won tons of awards. Order a donut or two. Consume. Then leave. Or for much better food (and good coffee) hop just down the street to Crema Cafe. Crema does almost everything better.

Also, why are you closed on Sunday?! A coffee/breakfast/bakery spot being closed on Sunday makes no sense.

I'll give Rosie's another try or two, but those Biscuits & Gravy better blow my mind, or I'm likely done with Rosie's. You can find great coffee and baked goods at a handful of other establishments, and I can't really see myself going here as often as I thought I would. Rosie's in it's current form is quite a disappointment. The coffee and donuts are great, everything else...not so much."}
{"text":"If you want a great environment, go here.  If you want wonderful baked goods, go here. If you believe in buying local and quality, go here. Their maple-bacon donut is awesome, the staff very friendly and the owners are sweet people who treat the staff wonderfully."}
{"text":"Fun little coffee shop - plenty of pastries and donuts, and the espresso drinks were fun!  I had nitro coffee on tap, perfect for a warm fall afternoon."}
{"text":"Wonderful paninis! We came in for lunch and ordered two paminis; the Eddie and the Pear and Brie. Both I would get again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful sandwiches and paninis. The side salad I got with my sandwich was super yummy too. Decent price for what you get. Smells like heaven when you walk in being a bakery and all. Super nice people. Nice little cafe and a great spot for lunch. Will return next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee, great service and fresh doughnuts. I've been here twice in as many days and personally think this place has a lot of potential..... Elapsed time.... Ok I come here every time I'm in the neighborhood same great coffee, same great service!"}
{"text":"Food and dessert both fabulous my lunch was also my dinner.  Chicken salad on a crossiant and it was so good!!  Loved!  Want to go some morning for fresh donuts"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick cuppa but stayed for a brilliant cup and a coffee lesson!  Pour over, siphon or aero press and more.  Great space and an actual coffee bar where the coffee professional will make your cup and explain while you watch. 

Of course, they have a quick cup option when time is of the essence.  

Regardless, I highly recommend coming here and enjoying one of life's simple pleasures.  

See you here."}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointing based on the other reviews.  My sandwich and side salad were fine.  That's it.  I had The Madison (I think that's what it was called, its no longer listed on their website).  Hummus, feta, veggies on so-so bread (from a local bakery--I'd switch bakeries if it were up to me).  I would chosen something else if the menu had specified that it was not plain hummus.  Seemed to be red pepper hummus, which I typically don't care for.  And it didn't work because they paired flavored hummus with flavored feta.  It would make more sense to only have one or the other (if any) flavored.  The salad was ok, could have been more special.  People are trying to make this place out to be something more than what it is: a place with food in a strip mall in Monona."}
{"text":"I am in love with the brie and pear panini.  Like actually in love.  I also had a cold press which was delicious.  Don't be fooled by the name; it's a perfect lunch destination as well as a coffee and pastry break location. This is a nice little gem."}
{"text":"After traveling for almost 12 hours we searched in earnest for a good place to eat. The selections along 90 in this area were limited and we decided just to get off the highway and drive around until something popped up on the map that sounded interesting.  The maple bacon filled donut offering made us turn around and go back! We got the last one today!!! And soooo glad we did.  My daughter called it but she was nice enough to give us all a taste. The smoky, salty, meaty crunch was the perfect foil for the maple icing.  The filling was more similar to what I remember European buttercream filling to be - lightly sweet, rich and buttery. It was enough to make any pastry lover melt. 

We all got egg sandwiches in different varieties - ham on biscuit, ham on croissant, sausage on biscuit and bacon on croissant.  Though the baked goods are all made in house and delicious we all agreed that the biscuit was the best. All their meats were great and the eggs were perfectly done.  

Service was friendly and quick. Though the prices seemed a little steep at first once we took a bite we understood how they could totally justify their prices."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful lunch here today: the grilled cheese sandwich made with pear slices and Brie accompanied by a tasty side salad of mixed greens with just the right amount of vinaigrette dressing. Butternut squash soup is one of my favorite fall dishes. Rita's may be the best that I've ever tasted. My date had a Meg Ryan moment when she tasted it. The dessert case is filled to the brim with temptations that I will need to sample on a return visit."}
{"text":"Walking into Rosie's you are greeted with a friendly 'hello', a welcoming smile, and a delicious set of deserts displayed right before you. You can either have a seat to your right in some cozy booths, or take a left and grab a drink at their large coffee bar. 

I think the real treasure at Rosie's are the baked goods. They are cheap and scrumptious. Their cinnamon rolls are about the size of a human head and are only $3. All of their deserts just taste superb. However, the rest of their food is just alright. I ordered the Chicken Salad sandwich and was neither thrilled nor disappointed. The croissant from the sandwich was probably the best part, go figure. I had a side of pasta salad and it was a little bland. Overall it was just ok.

It's a new establishment so there are bound to be some kinks that need to be fixed, but like others have said this place has great potential, especially with it's new management and appreciative staff. They're all so nice. It's lovely!

I got word that they are making a breakfast menu and are going to start serving breakfast next week! I definitely think breakfast will be Rosie's forte. Along with all of their delicious goodies."}
{"text":"My wife and I stop here once, sometimes twice a weekend to get bakery items.  They are that good.  We always get a cinnamon roll and a second item to try.  
Yesterday's visit was an almond scone on the recommendation of the gentleman behind the counter.  On past visits, we have tried the maple bacon doughnut, the cookies 'n cream doughnut and an over-sized M&M cookie.  All, very delicious.  The doughnuts are light and airy but also chewy with an adequately sweet filling, not like your typical cake doughnuts  The cookies are large with just the right amount of crunch to them.  
For us, the cinnamon rolls are the star.  I don't know what blend of flour they use, but they are surprisingly delicious and chewy with fantastic cream cheese icing.  Also, they are huge.  We always split one between the both of us.
I think we have had their coffee only on one occasion, since I don't normally enjoy specialty drinks and would prefer to make a pot of coffee at home.  
They also have other options for hot breakfast and lunch items that we have yet to try and hope to, someday"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a hip scene on Monona Drive and the quality of all of the products and service is outstanding. JBC Coffee Roasters coffee is as good as it gets and the food is phenomenal. The staff is so welcoming and friendly--you can tell that the owners must treat them very well because they're always happy!"}
{"text":"My experience at Rosie's was disappointing. We visited Rosie's for breakfast ordering both the breakfast sandwich and the biscuits and gravy. The breakfast sandwich was on a dense rubbery croissant that felt and tasted as though it as microwaved with cheap American cheese and a egg patty. The biscuits and gravy - awful. Dense bricks of biscuits with a sub par gravy. The worst were the breakfast potatoes coated in dried herbs making them inedible. After a few bites we looked at each other and said \"I'm sorry, this is really bad\" - needless to say we did not finish our food and left. 
The barista stood behind the coffee bar talking about an older woman who put a $0.70 tip in the tip jar and complained that \"that's not going to pay the bills!\" It was a really sad experience - I can't say that we will go back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have driven by this marvelous cafe for months and didn't notice them.  We stopped in for lunch today and found Rosie's to be so amazing.  We both had the daily special, soup and sandwich.  The soup was absolutely wonderful, full of large chunks of meat and a lovely cream base.  The sandwich was delicious on a fresh marble rye bread and plenty of meat and cheese.  The staff was attentive and wanted to ensure we were enjoying our food and had everything we needed.  The young man who took our order was juggling multiple customers and was efficient, but very knowledgeable about the menu.  We met the owner and she was delightful, as were the rest of the staff.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Rosie's coffee bar expertly crafts their coffee, Ronnie is truly an artist and one of the best baristas in Madison. Any coffee you order she makes it with expertise and it will always have the perfect balance of flavors. Kathleen is also great as is the rest of the staff.

The doughnuts here are amazing I recommend the maple bacon or raspberry filled, the simple cake doughnuts are also very good. I must also say I am in love with the almond scone. I have tried the bacon  egg and cheese biscuit and found that to be above average, as well as the main Monona club in lunch offerings. 

If you are looking for a local gem of a cafe stop into Rosie's where the staff is friendly and the owner Coz actually really cares about her patrons."}
{"text":"Had the sunrise egg croissant with potatoes and good coffee. The restaurant is fresh and clean and the service is very helpful and cheery. 

The sandwich was a large croissant with very soft and fluffy scrambled eggs and chives. Add some salt to the rosemary roasted red potatoes and they are perfectly soft (although I roast my own to more crispy). The sandwich is large and a bit unwieldy as a handheld, so grab a fork and eat it like an open face. I wish the sandwich came with meat - sausage would be a nice addition. There are better croissants in town, but that doesn't detract from the Sunrise.

I didn't get anything from the buttery bakery counter, so a return trip will happen. To the extent they are locally sourcing ingredients is appreciated. As is the cheery big band music on the speakers.

I also left a yelp comment on the sausage gravy. Run, don't walk, to try this stuff. I always try the gravy if it's on a menu and nothing is ever as good as mom's. But this one is the first that comes close. You can tell it is from scratch and not low fat. The Avenue's brunch gravy pales in comparison. Trust me. This stuff is the real deal."}
{"text":"I have been to Rosie's to buy coffee and pastries for coworkers everything we tried was delicious.  I was looking to find better than grocery store pies for Thanksgiving, but it was very last minute (the day before) but I thought to give Rosie's a call.  The woman who helped me and took my order was soooo nice and was super accommodating so that I was able to pick up fresh pies that afternoon.  The caramel apple walnut and pumpkin pies were still warm and smelled absolutely fantastic.  I somehow managed to not devour them before serving to my guests the next day.  The quality of the pies was amazing.  Totally fresh ingredients and everything made from scratch with care, talent, and love and they look beautiful.  These pies cannot even be compared to grocery store pies and are completely worth their price.  Both were a huge hit with my guests and I can't wait to order pies from Rosie's again!!!"}
{"text":"Nice environment.  The young lady at the front counter was very friendly.  We had coffee, breakfast sandwiches, quiche and potatoes.  Everything was wonderful.  Thank you for a nice breakfast."}
{"text":"I really like the vibe in this place..I've only been here for lunch and have not had any pastries. I really like their panini pressed sandwich fair. The Madison is lovely little gnosh of humus and veggies. Nothing earth shaking, but a nice little sandwich. This is a great addition for this end of Monona drive."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and delivery was really good, too. I will be ordering again the future."}
{"text":"I bought a couple of cake slices from here when I was traveling through Madison on business. To be honest, they were tasty but not something I'd buy on a regular basis for $5.00 per slice or more. The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the place had a really great vibe, the staff was very nice, it is locally owned, and everything is baked fresh. I like to eat at and support these types of places. I just don't like paying $5.00 for a piece of cake unless it's out of this world. I'd still go there again and try something else though."}
{"text":"Ok, Yelpers. Just got home from my third try at this place. I'd sincerely wish that I could score this place higher, but I cannot. The point that burned me the most is that when they run your card at the point of purchase, they offer you your coice of gratuity before you're even seated. Ok, I bit on the 20% option, only because I've worked for tips, and you'd seriously have to (expletive deleted) me to not earn that. Well, guess what? Ya know what you get in terms of service for your 20 percent? Jack Shit, that's what! I had to go back to the counter for another glass of milk, at which point I was told \"That'll be another $1.57, sir\". Sheesh! Yeah, whatever.
Put it on my tab. So, for my betting against the house for another 20 points, I received absolutely ZERO service at the table, and I cannot believe for the life of me that any of the meals I've had there was made to order. I truly want to support locally owned small businesses, and I've gone out of my way to try this place more than once. I live walking distance away, but the sad fact is that The Clown with the Golden Arches is even closer, and they do a better job with breakfast. At least I can see my hash brown go in the fryer. At Rosie's I've tried the quich twice, and they're batting .500 in terms of their daily \"specials\". 
No bacon for you, round eye! Are you kidding? I can only hope that this Rosie is the same slob I see on TV. That way, I can use the same baseball bat twice. Caveat Emptor, Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I have stopped here several times on road trips and I am always impressed. The baked goods are delicious and the coffee is great. The staff is super friendly and I love that they employ a person with disabilities. I would highly recommend this gem!"}
{"text":"I visited this place, and the customer service was great, and I bought the flourless chocolate cake, and it was very tasty and high quality. 
I would definitely visit this place again. It's the only place I have found in Madison to have yummy flourless chocolate cake. 

They also have a peanut butter cake that looks really yummy. I will have to buy that next time I visit this bakery.

{"text":"Excellent new coffee place on Monona Dr. Multiple plug ins, great coffee, excellent food and bakery items. Spacious updated seating areas as well. Come here to study or have business meetings/lunches... You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Friendly service, and tasty baked goods. We just got donuts and scones to go, so will have to come back another time to try their other offerings. The almond scone was a particular favorite. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Some of Madison's very best coffee, get the poor over, peaberry bean is my favorite. Also love the breakfast sandwiches, and cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"A friend of mine (Kent) brought me some cake from Rosie's tonight. It was chocolate, but there were definite hints of raspberry in there. Hands down, it was some of the best cake I have ever had! I highly recommend this bakery!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Sunday.  Strange location, small, cramped.  Many people standing and talking and nothing on staff's part to help.  Spilled my coffee all over someone because they wouldn't get out of the way of the customers!!  I shared a donut with my girlfriend, white chocolate and chocolate chips was awful.  Terrible donut, one of the worst things I've put into my mouth and I wanted to spit it out, and would have if not in polite company.

The awful donut aside, we had the Biscut & Gravy with potato hash.  The biscut/gravy was good.  Not the best I've ever had, but a solid 4 star UNTIL they put paprika on it, it's strange with it, and makes it spicy.  I'd give it a 2.5-3 star, Ordering it without paprika (they just sprinkle it on) I'd give it a solid 4 stars.  The potatoes are cut up potatoes, and sweet potatoes.  Some of the best I've ever had and total 5 stars.  Bringing up the dish I'd say to a solid 4 (no paprika!).  They often run out of potatoes though, and if they didn't have them, I wouldn't order.  I think it was about $8-9 for Biscut/gravy and that's a bit steep without the best thing on the plate.

I would avoid the donuts, cheesecakes looked good.  I'd try a sandwich,"}
{"text":"Rosie's is my favorite place to gather with friends. The food and baked goods are as good as my grandma's.  The coffee bar is an experience that all coffee lovers have to try. Coz made me a put over that changed my life!"}
{"text":"BEST LATTES IN MADISON!

My husband and I have been looking locally for good breakfast places and this one is my favorite. The menu is not a lot but the food is great! The lattes is what I really go for. I'm a coffee drinker and I can tell good quality-made lattes over bad.  I had a Chai the first time I went and you can really smell and taste all of the spices, which is what Chai's should be like -- not all watered down with milk.  This one tops Starbucks for me. The latte art was also an added bonus :)"}
{"text":"I like Rosie's. I want to love Rosie's.

Their baked goods are *excellent.* Everyone I know raves about their doughnuts and other sweets, and the coffee options would make a java nerd dance a little jig. As a tea-drinker, I highly appreciate a business that understands scalding hot water and leaving the teabag permanently in the drink is NOT how you brew a proper cuppa. (They even give you a timer!)

My chats with the owner have shown me someone clearly devoted to both their business and their vision.

But every time I go back, something's...missing when it comes to cementing it as a place I'd recommend to all my friends on that side of town.

The service is always friendly, but not always prompt. The layout is a bit odd -- as if the place has a split personality. You walk in the door, and are faced with a bakery display full of delicious baked goods. On the left is a coffee bar. On the right is a diner-style restaurant with booths and tables. 

Because the cash register and large chalkboard menu are on the diner side, It looks like the bakery items are all they offer (which would be fine, but isn't the case here,) and  there's no clear indication where to go when you walk in. 

I'm not sure if it's a case of a business with an identity crisis, in need of editing and focus (a coffee/pastry bar would make a lot more sense given their offerings, but may not be sustainable as a business in that area,) or just a location in need of rearranging their interior to make more sense for the customer who walks in the door so everyone's less confused.."}
{"text":"UPDATE: my family has visited this location a few times since the original review and the attitude has improved. Sometimes it's just the way people are. I don't want this message preventing others from checking this place out. Their coffee is great and they have some wonderful meals. They do cakes too! Checkout Rosie's. 

Original Review:

Don't order your latte while you're on your way to Rosies because the older man who answers the phone may not only make you feel horrible for doing so, when you get there to pick up your coffee and you ask for a pumpkin square, he may act like you're an oaf while he tries to figure out what you mean by a pumpkin square by rudely asking, \"what do you want?\" And when you point to the item you want in the case he says, \"oh a pumpkin bar\" as if there is a considerable difference between the meaning of a baked item in square or bar form. 

I love Rosie's, have visited quite often and have previously ordered while on the way to work, but this time was different. The older man was definitely not in a good mood--I'd rather believe that than think he's just a mean person--and then passed that having a bad day feeling right on to me. Thanks. Not really. Take my money, I'm outta here. Maybe I'll stop at Starbucks next time. 

I get it, sometimes you just have a bad day, but this was cold. Not cool. Not cool at all. 

2 stars for great coffee and food."}
{"text":"overall pretty good experience.  Decor is nice, new and very clean. Breakfast menu is very limited. Bakery menu is very large and is apparent that this is what they specialize in.  

Tried a small yellow cake and Oreo doughnut...it was pretty tasty! For breakfast I ordered a croissant sandwich with egg and bacon and a side of potatoes. They only have ketchup packets (this bugged me). 

I would come again!"}
{"text":"Simple but delicious little cafe for lunch!  The baked good are quite yummy, and my husband and I shared two of their sandwiches and were NOT disappointed.  This place is a little gem!"}
{"text":"*Disclaimer: I actually visited back in March; this review has been in my unfinished drafts for awhile. Aaaaanyway....*

Big band music was playing when I visited, always a favorite. The overall vibe is of having stepped back in time a bit, helped along by the large black and white photos of the owner's family weddings of the past; very sweet and charming.

The accent walls are painted in wide horizontal stripes in beige and brown, suggesting (to me, anyway) the layers of a mocha cake. There's a lot of subliminal messaging going on here.

I came for lunch, and ordered a Smokey's Beef sandwich. It was really good, with a super delicious dense bun. Maybe house made? They are a bakery. It was a hard decision because the menu items all sound amazing. Somewhat pricey compared to similar local places with similar offerings, but not too outrageous.

After my meal, which did not include dessert, I chatted with the owner, a delightful lady clearly devoted to her business and her craft. Found out she uses only butter from Switzerland which has a very low moisture content in her baked goods, and only King Arthur flour which is the only flour that the European Union allows to be imported from the US due to its quality standards. Also, they were soon going to be installing a new kind of coffee process, some Victorian era thing, which sounded intriguing. I need to go back soon and check that out. As well as some sweets, which is their forté, after all.

Great coffee, I might add! Cheerful service, overall pleasant atmosphere.

Weird things:

Odd placement of bar/counters and cases, no indication that they serve anything but baked goods from the small glass case placed right smack in front of the door upon entering. I didn't realize they served actual food ,too, 'til I walked around to the side.

An old lady patron complimented me on the perfect fit of my jeans. Awkward."}
{"text":"Stopped in here just this morning, and it turned out to be their first day. Those of you familiar with Kim's Noodles know the space. Rosie's is doing some good things with it--including a fireplace nook that appears to be waiting to be loaded with books. The bar has been turned into a, well, coffee bar. 

The coffee itself was delicious. That is always an important thing for me, and this was as good as any downtown coffee shop. I grabbed a box of donuts, which were a hit with staff here at work. I'll have to try other items soon. 

They also do cakes for special occassions."}
{"text":"Great attention paid to coffee here. They have a full selection of local JBC coffee and offer siphon, pour over and aeropress. They pay really close attention to their brewing. As for food,  we had the breakfast sandwich which was big and the biscuit was delicious. I was super sad the were out of donuts at 11 on Saturday, which they said was unusual. Looking forward to another trip."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Rosie's so when I drove past today I decided to stop in and see what all the fuss is about.  As soon as I walked in the door someone called out to greet me and I headed toward the ordering counter.  Breakfast is supposedly served until 1:30 pm on the weekends, but when I got there at noon, the first three items I tried to order were sold out.  One of those items were the potatoes, so I was offered the choice of greens or paying an extra $1 to upgrade to fruit.  While $1 may not be much, from a customer service standpoint they really should have offered the fruit for free since they were out of potatoes.

I ended up ordering the breakfast sandwich on a croissant (they were out of biscuits), a donut, and tea.  The donut, which they forgot to give me until I asked after all my food had been delivered, was delicious!  They have a nice selection of Rishi teas that comes in a nice pot with a timer and they'll refill the hot water if you ask.  The breakfast sandwich was a let-down.  The scrambled eggs were unseasoned, greyish and overcooked, not light and fluffy. 

I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was just a really busy day (mother's day), but I see in other reviews that running out of food seems to be a recurring issue.  I'll go back, because I do want to try the biscuits and gravy and those rosemary potatoes, but I'll be earlier next time!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Rosie's. The first time I went I ordered a dozen donuts for coworkers. I'm a donut lover so really I bought them as an excuse to eat a donut. When I bit into the donut there was a weird aftertaste. Everyone else said they were tasty so I assumed it was just me. 

Well, now my second visit confirmed what I first assumed. These donuts are not that great. It tastes as if the donuts are fried in oil that cooks other food. I can't put my finger on what the taste is but whatever it is I'm not a fan of.

I also bought two cupcakes to share with my boyfriend (because why not). They were hard and crusty. The frosting wasn't great either. 
 

After this last experience I will likely not be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in this morning for some coffee and breakfast. It was their breakfast \"soft opening\", so I was lucky enough to be among the first to try some of the best biscuits and gravy I have had in Madison. 

The biscuit was homemade, crisp on the outside, and chewy on the inside. The gravy was flavorful and -not- overwhelmingly salty (a huge problem with some restaurants) with just enough chunks of sausage to satisfy me. The side of rosemary potatoes were delicious, too. 

I also saw an egg-y croissant sandwich that looked pretty fantastic, so I will have to try that out soon. Other options include smoothies, oatmeal, strata, and a bunch of breakfast pastries.

Now, the food was great...but one of the best things about this spot is that they serve Johnson Brothers Coffee. Also known as some of the best coffee on the planet. Not only that, but they love their coffee, a lot, and you can order a standard drip coffee, pour over, french press, or have them use a fancy percolator. Pour-over is a fantastic way to enjoy a quality roast, but they do it right so you can expect to wait around 5 minutes for your cup to be ready once they start making it. 

OH! The donut. How can I forget the donut?? I chose a glazed yeast donut. The glaze is sweet, but not overwhelming. The donut itself is chewy and has almost a bit of a tang to it. They look similar to a krispy kreme, but they taste unlike any other yeast donuts I have had before. Very tasty. 

Did I mention that the service is fantastic and everyone is incredibly friendly and chatty?"}
{"text":"Let me say: Great service, great pastries, innovative menu, delicious ingredients...

BUT, this place should really take a lesson from similar cafés like Manna and not cheap out on portion sizes!! For 9 bucks (which is approx the price for most lunch items) I want to feel satisfied and full!! Likely Not going to happen here if you're an average adult. My boyfriend and I were both disappointed by our meager portions... I got the ham/cheddar/broccoli quiche, which came with a tiny side salad.. I mean like 3 fork fulls, and the quiche was amazingly good but should have been at least 50% bigger of a slice to be worth it and fill up on. My boyfriend had a roast beef panini. In his case the sandwich was great, but small, and he commented that the pasta side salad \"actually tastes like something\", and was in a nice heaping portion. 

This place would be GREAT if they offered just a bit more for the buck."}
{"text":"Rosie's is a neighborhood bakery with a little eat-in restaurant that is great for a small breakfast meeting or a little solitude with a book or laptop to catch up on the email (the wifi is fast and reliable). Just six small booths and as many tables, I've never seen it crowded on a weekday morning. I have not sampled much of their bakery fare yet because, at the moment, I'm obsessed with their breakfast sandwiches. Served with either a croissant or a biscuit and choice of sausage, ham or bacon (with a healthy slab of scrambled egg slathered with cheese), these sandwiches are the shit! Not expensive and big enough to satisfy without need for any sides or baked goods.

I have tried a doughnut just for fun, and while good, it didn't blow me away so I'll reserve any further comment on their baked goods until I've had a chance to really try them out.

The final word on Rosies is their coffee. They serve Johnson Bros. Roasters coffee, which if you're a Madisonian, is serious cred. JBC (https://www.jbccoffeeroasters.com) coffee is my long-time favorite coffee and finding a little shop like this in my hometown is golden. Rosies will remain one of my quiet breakfast haunts for the foreseeable future with their unbeatable combo of quiet workspace, killer breakfast sandwiches, and the best coffee in the region."}
{"text":"(Written April 2015, not sure why it didn't post.) My fiancée and I went here for a quick brunch before going golfing at the Monona Golf Course. The only two positive things I can say about it is that the food came out quickly and my fiancé's California sandwich with a side of greens was really good (although the vinaigrette for the greens was disgusting and sweet). I'm vegetarian, and I was very excited to get my breakfast sandwich (eggs and cheddar cheese) on a croissant with the side of bacon given to my fiancé, and a slice of 4 cheese quiche with a side of homemade Rosemary potatoes. Sounded delicious, albeit expensive, with the quiche alone costing about $8. Our $30 breakfast wound up being a flop. My croissant was clearly one of those frozen and thawed kind, but worse, the whole sandwich - croissant, egg, and cheese came out to me fresh from the microwave. Have you ever had microwaved croissant? It's soggy. And eggs from the microwave will burn the roof of your mouth. The whole thing was flavorless. The plate came with a side of cutely cut fruit (Orange slice and strawberry) where all of the fruit was either rotted or close to it. The real disappointment was with my quiche. Apparently the potatoes are pre-prepared with bacon, and can not be ordered vegetarian. That was a huge disappointment for me, and it was probably bad for the store, because they swapped it for greens with their sickly-sweet vinaigrette, and my theory is that the vinaigrette was what made and my fiancé sick after the meal. My quiche was also from the microwave, but since I ate it second, it had already cooled off and was pretty cold. The quiche crust was disgusting - the buttery, store bought frozen crusts. The quiche was pretty tasteless. It actually tasted OK once I poured so much pepper on top for flavor and picked off the gross, microwaved, soggy, buttery crust. In the end, my fiancé and I both left feeling sick. He recovered quickly, but 24 hours later, I still feel sick to my stomach after this meal."}
{"text":"Poor breakfast experience! Stopped in for a quick breakfast. We ordered coffees, bagels, and a donut. There was an issue with their order ticketing and we ended up waiting 30 minutes for 2 toasted bagels. 

The major issue is after 20 minutes, I asked about our food and they realized the ticket issue. It still took 10 more minutes before we actually got our bagels. There was no sense of urgency to get us our food. They were, however, very apologetic.

The bagel itself was decent, not sure where they purchase them from. The donut we had was stale and not very good. Also, 2 different sets of silverware were dirty and we had to go up and get new ones. 

Overall, a pretty bad visit. I don't anticipate coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered the dark coffee, which was bitter, the Rosemary and Goat cheese Quiche, which was the most physically flat quiche I've ever had, the crust bottom was soggy, and the filling had no flavor at all. I was completely disappointed."}
{"text":"Quite remarkable donuts and good coffee. 

Found this place via Yelp and I'm sure glad I stopped by. I do often seek out donut shops and enjoy the gourmet options and unique twists. This donut shop is pretty awesome. The standout donuts are a type of filled/pocket hybrid.  They essentially make a oval shaped pastry, slice it like a bun, and squeeze some amazingly fluffy frosting up inside. The Oreo one was omg amaze balls, and I don't even know exactly what the chocolate one was but it was equally amazing. 

In the words of my family member: \"I don't even normally like donuts but these are amazing!\".

As for the coffee, it was good but the service was disjointed from the baked goods area. It took 5mins or so to make my coffee which is pretty slow. And the store was empty so I'm not sure why it would take so long to push some espresso out and into a cup. 

Overall, great donuts! Would like to see a few more raised donuts with holes in the future."}
{"text":"Just had the baked oatmeal which was delicious, hearty and enough for 2 more meals. The morning person, Jessie, makes the visit terrific. She is friendly and helpful, even very early on a snowy morning. Oh, the coffee is excellent -"}
