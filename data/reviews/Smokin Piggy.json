{"text":"Kinda weird this one... I remember going to this place when it was a food truck between Bradford and Newmarket and I recall that they had more menu  options then this actual brick and mortar place. Tried the shrimp and grits... never had grits before but I guess I had an expectation that it would be creamy, it was dry and chunky.... also I thought the shrimps would maybe be kinda bigger and more flavourful, they were neither large or had much flavor, and I mean common just remove the tails.... I aint eating tails so just take the few moments to remove em off your cheap tiny shrimp please. 

I even went back again and decided to go for the pulled pork mac and cheese.... the cheese (bechemel) sauce was not very tasty or gooey, the pulled pork wasn't anything like real special, and I know this is kind of strange to complain about but they had the multicoloured pasta (with the green and orange and normal one) and it really wasn't visually appealing at all. That will be my last time going there again.... maybe its just me.... but I wouldn't bother with this place, there are better."}
