{"text":"We just finished lunch here and our food was very good. We read Yelp reviews an decided to try it ourselves. We ordered chicken Philly cheesesteak and two house salads. All prepared quickly and good service. Small place-but nice atmosphere. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service
Casual atmosphere
Priced maybe $1 or so higher than you see else where, but the quality is there and so are the portions. 
Patio looks out onto parking lot :(
Great regional & local craft brews
I had the Philly with o-rings; it was delicious and very filling - I should have gotten a to go box, but took one for the team and fished it off. 
My wife had the French Dip and thought it was too salty, but still decent, so you may consider asking for no salt to be added.
We enjoyed it enough that we will be back."}
{"text":"Love the local beer murals and draft selection.  A lot of beer places you compromise on the food.  Not here.   The food is very good.  I had the cobber salad and my husband had the wings. The service was good too!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good bar and grill. Kind of smelled funny. Lots of local beer on tap but not all beers were great."}
{"text":"Great selection in food and beer! Staff is welcoming and polite. I can never know what I want to eat between the Chicken sandwich, chili, bratwurst, cheesesteak etc. Sit either inside or outside, either place there's always great music playing."}
{"text":"BEST chili on the south eastside. Damn good burgers and a good selection of local craft beer."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place and he is very picky about restaurants.  We eat here pretty often, so we have had most of the items on the menu.  Everything we've eaten has been great, but some of our favorites are the grilled wings and the quesadilla.  We have tried a few of the specials and they have been delicious.  The beer selection is great also.  You should definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had lunch and a few beers here the other day and we love the beers on tap. But that's about as good as it gets. The food was barely average. We ordered the dip, buffalo wings and the meltdown, the wings were ok but both sandwiches really had no flavor.The au jus was extremely salty! I love salty more than sweet so for me to say that it was strong. I was really hoping to have found a place near home that my wife and I could enjoy good food and a pint.  So for me the beer not the food is the reason I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Great beers, friendly service and great bar food. I highly recommend The Sankey sandwich. It's similar to a type of sandwich popular in Pittsburgh. Either you know what I am talking about or you don't. This and Dunwellz have the best bar food on the southeast side of town. Go."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for beer and food. Bar and grill normal. Decent craft brew and the Texas Caviar was pretty good. Nice people and pretty fair service."}
{"text":"I always have the hardest time finding a GOOD place for food in the Matthews area. Especially a bar that's not just a sports bar. 

The turkey Reuben was delicious!  I don't think I've ever had better, actually!  

We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the obvious: Great local draft list, most are $4.00 (great bottle selection too). 

They have a variety of apps, salads and sandwiches. We tried a chicken philly and the Sankey - both were made to order and hot off the grill. Their chips are made in-house, so we both opted for those. All the food was delish - of course the cold drafts were too!

Our waitress was very attentive and checked on us just the right amount. All in all we were very happy here and will definitely be back soon!

Oh - I almost forgot my favorite part - their décor! All the paintings are by local artists inspired by NC breweries, very cool!"}
{"text":"Cool little place tucked away off Independce (Hwy. 74).  If you aren't paying attention you will certainly drive right by, but that would be a mistake.  This bar and grill is actually a pleasant addition to Matthews with great taps and a decent menu for those looking for burgers, salads and daily specials.

While there I had a salad and it was really good and of course the beer was great.  I can't remember how many taps they have but there are several.  The service was good (a little slow) but they were inbetween shifts I think as it was around 2-3pm when we stopped in.

Parking is a breeze with surface parking available."}
{"text":"It seems as if there are taprooms popping up all over Charlotte but most are missing one feature - awesome food. Imagine going to a place that serves the best local craft beer and amazing food. Look no further than Sankey's. Yes, there are taprooms  in Charlotte with excellent food trucks in the parking lot, but Sankey's brings the excellent food inside with courteous staff (Andy and Brooke). Make this place a must on your list and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great customer service and good bar food . Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Had the Sankey  meltdown, which was very good. The barbecue sauce was really good. 

Had these crafts on tap, all of which were pretty good. The Bird Song is a bit of an acquired taste, but not what you think it would be. 
Ramble on Red amber ale- my favorite of the bunch 
Nella Pils
Bird song Jalapeño pale ale
Peacemaker pale ale

All in all, as I plan to be back, this is a worthwhile place to frequent when I'm in NC."}
{"text":"What a cool little spot in Matthews. Stopped in today for lunch to celebrate my dad's birthday and boy was I impressed with their food. I ordered the (French) Dip. Fantastic! The roast beef is made in house and was tender and full of flavor. The house made chips are some of the best I've had. A consistent crunch and not all stuck together like you see so often at other places. My mom ordered the lunch special of the day, Thai chicken sandwich. I was fortunate to try a bite. That s#*t was good! Nice spice level too! Dad, born and raised in Wisconsin, ordered the brat. He loved it. Of course one of the things that makes this place great is the craft beers! Lots on tap and very reasonably priced. Most are $4 a pint. They also have a good selection of bottled craft beers too. The staff is friendly and the service was good. A few TVs to watch the games and plenty more food items to try! I've found a new hang out."}
{"text":"This place sits in a strip mall in Matthews next to an Ashley Furniture store.  Inside there are tables scattered throughout and a 10 seater bar to the right.  The decor consists of paintings from the local breweries whose beers are served here.  Loved that idea!!

As for beer on tap, the Big 4 local breweries were represented here....Triple C, NoDa, OMB and Birdsong as well as Foothills, Natty Green, Lonerider and Oskar Blues.  The slogan here is \"No Crap on Tap\".   Craft beer lovers appreciate that!

They have a few bottled beer options as well as wine.  

They also server food of appetizers, salads and sandwiches.  I opted for the Chicken cheesesteak with fries.  This was the best chicken philly I've had in years!  The chicken was so flavorful and the bread was so light and soft.  The fries were good also!

The service was good here but I had gotten there right when they opened so I was the only one there for a while.  

I enjoyed this place and love their craft beer selection and definitely need to come back!"}
