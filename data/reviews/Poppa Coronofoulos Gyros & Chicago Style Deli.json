{"text":"I love this place, have been going to \"Poppas\" for years, started back when they were on the corner of Milwaukee and Stoughton. Best place to get Dogs and Gyros.  The building may be run down, the booths maybe hard plastic, but the Gyros and Chicago dogs are worth the trip for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I so hate to give this place a bad review, because the people in the restaurant are so friendly and the atmosphere is cute with all the Chicago kitsch on the walls, the people eating there seem to like it, and that's worth something. Visually, this really could be a Chicago restaurant. I would have just skipped reviewing them, but the sigh says Authentic Chicago style in huge letters, and I'm sorry, that's just so not remotely true. I was born & bred in Chicago, lived there most of my life, I'm in the demographic that has eaten lots of Chicago style junk food. Now I'm in Madison, I love it here, there is some fantastic food here, but I walk or drive by the sign every week, I sometimes crave food from home, and I definitely can't scratch that itch here. First, please don't even call a food a gyro if you do not have a gyro spit! The spit rotates, hence the term GYRO; if it's not from a spit, it's NOT a gyro. You cannot duplicate the awesomeness of that slow roasting with any other method. The gyros we got were obviously defrosted and cooked on a grill, they were not crispy, not authentic, and not tasty at all. (In Chicago where people are more comfortable with confrontation I straight up ask if there is a spit if I don't see one, if they say NO I say \"Then you have a lot of nerve claiming to serve gyros.\" In all my many years of doing this I have never found a place that actually does have a spit hidden in the back, the spit makes the gyro, they are always displayed proudly in the front of the restaurant. To be frank, it's good advice to just avoid any place that fibs about their food like that, you won't be missing anything.) The tzatsiki is also not great, and good tzatsiki is important. For authentic Chicago style anything you need a mandolin for the onions - big chunks of onion do not belong on a gyro or Chicago style hotdog or sandwich of any kind. I didn't get a hot dog, because I'm super picky about dogs, I'll wait until I visit home and get one at Hot Dougs or Drew's eatery, or Demon Dogs) 2 stars for being cute, friendly, and having edible junk food at affordable prices, but not great and not at all authentic."}
{"text":"We had been in Madison for about 3 months and needed to find \"our\" gyros place--Poppa Coronfoulos Gyros is the place.  The gyros are great, with a very tasty sauce on top of good meat and nice, soft pita bread.  We buy a Naked Dog for our son and were happy with the quality of the hot dog.  And lastly, my husband and I each get an order chili cheese fries--so delicious, even though they do use American cheese."}

Nice staff, funky Chicago stuff on the walls (sleeve from a Chicago album on the wall, Wrigley stuff, the usual and the unusual-Jayne Byrne, anyone?). 

Dogs are tasty and come with skinny fries that are easy to pop into your mouth. I took a chance on a hamburger and found it pretty good--I'd have it again except I feel like I should get a dog when I go there. Just off the Capital City Bike Trail, in case you need an excuse for why you are wolfing down dogs, cola, and fries."}
