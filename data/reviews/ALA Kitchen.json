{"text":"Very good shanghai food, especially the ??? which was juicy and in just the right size. The chicken wonton soup and shredded cabbage nian gao are must try. The place is very packed, especially at night so make sure you get reservations."}
{"text":"The foods were pretty good and services were pretty quick. I went around 5pm on Saturday evening and around 6pm, expect some waits and lineup. The soup dumpling and pan fried dumpling were okay, and the wonton in red peanut sauce was pretty tasty. 
I would still go back but won't be anytime soon and not really craving to go back."}
{"text":"First of all, A La Kitchen is fairly hidden as it is tucked behind First Markham Place. I did not even realize there was a plaza behind FMP until today.

I made a reservation for our party of 8 ahead of time, so we did not have to wait at all. It was not too busy at 12:30 PM, but a small crowd did start to build up around 1 PM.

We ordered:
-Chicken and corn soup
-Steamed pork dumplings
-Small wontons in red (spicy) peanut sauce
-Fried bread (Chinese silver bun)
-Mu Shu chicken with pancake
-Pork wrapped in lotus leaf 
-A La house special fried rice cake with pork
-A La house special fried vermicelli with seafood

The soup was nothing special. The soup dumplings were delicious (comparable to Asian Legend). The wontons fell apart and the sauce was quite spicy (Din Tai Fung does this better). The fried bread was extremely disappointing - only the top was fried but it was not crispy at all, and the condensed milk was watered down (It's the best part! Why would they do that?). The Mu Shu chicken was all right, but the texture of the pancakes was a little hard. The pork was tasty and it was not too fatty. The fried rice cake was overcooked, but not too oily, and I believe it was fried with seaweed (??) which was interesting. I thought the fried vermicelli was nothing special with fried egg, ham and shrimp, but a couple people really liked it.

The food was not salty, and it was not too oily. (They make a promise of 'no MSG'.) The portions were decent, too. One thing to consider, however, is they do NOT accept credit cards. 

I have dined at Din Tai Fung and Asian Legend before, and out of these 3 restaurants, I'm fairly certain I will only be returning to Asian Legend if I'm ever craving Shanghai food again. (It is often crowded but there are many locations and they have always been consistent. Their staple items are delicious. Without a doubt, Asian Legend makes the best fried Chinese silver buns!)"}
{"text":"My family, boyfriend and I decided to try this restaurant on new years eve as recommended by a family friend. We usually order a set menus for the party number as it makes ordering easier and usually ( and let me emphasize on this \"usually\" word) better value than ordering separately and house specialties items are sometimes included.

The set menus was 98 dollars for what seemed like a pretty good deal with soup, appetizer, 5 entrees, rice/noodle and a dessert. Typical set menu at a Chinese restaurant! HOWEVER, when the dishes arrived, WOW it was the SMALLEST PORTIONS I have ever seen in a Chinese restaurant. The dish sizes were the size of a side plate with only the noodle dish maintaining the size of a real plate size. I was so disappointed by the portion size that I waved down the server to literally ask him why in the world were my 5 entrees SO SMALL that it looked like a side dish.

Two servers came and both had inconsistent answers while one said that it was just the plate and not the content that was small. (which is BS because we are not blind and the content was clearly 60% of the actual full size.) the other server said that it was smaller and then my mother became so angry and asked them why did you not let us know that the portions would be smaller?

I have never been to a restaurant that had set menu entrees smaller than the normal menu dish. It was appalling. The dinner was set for 6 ppl and we had 5 ppl and we were NOT FULL. I have never been to a Chinese restaurant and not been full. The other sever told us to order more if we were not full and I just told them to leave us alone as they have already pissed us off enough.

But no, THEY DID NOT STOP AT THAT. They decided to make us even more angry by bringing in the dessert while we were still eating the SMALL entrees in attempt to kick us out faster. We got our food around 650 and by 730 we were out the door and this was not voluntary either. This was a the result of the dishes being so small that we finished it so fast and the fact that they stuffed the dessert in our faces while we were peeved. We could not take it anymore and had to get out.

I had the worst new years eve dinner ever yesterday. I hate this restaurant so much that I will do anything to convince people not to go.

Also, the food is SO SUBPAR that this fact alone does not warrant a first visit, let alone a second visit.

Worst 135 dollars I have ever spent in my life. We still tipped because we are not cheap. We just wanted good food with good company and the first was destroyed by this stuck up restaurant.

IF YOU ARE SMART, DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and ordered a A La Special Fried Rice and the Onion Pancake.  The rice was fried with eggs and had a sauce put over the rice afterward. The sauce had mixture of shrimp, squid, beef and A FISH BALL. I found it funny that it only came with one fish ball in the entire dish. It also came with a fried egg cooked over hard. Overall the dish was alright. On the other hand the onion pancake was bit greasy. I had to use my napkin to soak up some of the oil. 

The service was alright. Food came out promptly after order and the staff were somewhat attentive."}
{"text":"I dined here quite a few times and never disappointed! It is not a huge place, but they do take reservations, so please call ahead of time if you know you are gonna come here. 

I had their sets a few times. It covers their most popular dishes, very reasonably priced and sized.  The most recent visit, I had their steamed dumplings, shanghai pan fried shrimp, the broccoli with egg white, shanghai fried noodles... honestly, everything was good, there is nothing that I don't like.  The only dish that wasn't too good was the wonton in chicken broth, the wonton wasn't too fresh, but we told the manager and he offered us another soup without extra charge. 

Don't forget to order the fried banana red bean paste donuts dessert, it's amazing!"}
{"text":"I love Shanghainese food. From Xiaolongbao to crispy duck, I can eat them day in day out. 

On the evening of crazy hail in Markham/Richmond Hill, a few friends decided to get together and try this restaurant as we all crave for Shanghainese food that evening. We made the reservation for 6:30. When we arrived at 6:30, a table is already waiting for us - what a surprise! I always see Asian restaurants overbook and even if you made a reservation, 10 - 20 minutes wait is still needed. Not on this night though, kudos to them (even though the table they gave us is the one right beside the door LOL).

We started the evening with of course Xiaolongbao (steam pork dumplings). Unfortunately, it is nothing special - Ding Tai Fung's pork dumpling is better. Plus each order only comes with 4 dumplings (most of the places I visited usually come with 6). We move on to main courses such as \"Po Meat Lotus Leaf Wrapped\", \"Special Deep Fried Duck\" and \"Shanghai Fried Rice Cake\". They were all quite delicious. 

I would definitely make another trip here."}
{"text":"Its been around for a while. The owner had a restaurant at yonge & clark but that was not an ideal location and i think she bailed on it to open this place; took some staff too from the originsl joint too. 

The food is above average, as is the price. There was a dish on the menu that i used to like allot, it dont remember the exact name, but it was an appetizer of spicy chicken, tofu, and peanuts; it was AWESOME, and it was the only reason i came to this place. Now that its off the menu, i dont go as often, maybe not at all. 

To the nice owner lady: BRING BACK the spicy peanut tofu chicken dish! (Please). I will definately change the rating to a 4 or 5 if this was done!


Edit: you can request the spicy tofu/peanut chicken dish and they will make it special order!!!! nice. Im changing my rating to 5."}
{"text":"the food was good.....until i saw RATS crawling around the restaurant since across from the place is a construction/lanfill site"}
{"text":"Overall, pretty good Shanghainese food at a decent price.  We ordered the pre-set combo dinner for 6 pax.  The highlight was the smoked duck.  All other dishes were decent and tasty which included a 3 item appetizer (drunken chicken/spare rib/tofu), eel, tofu and beans, kung pao chicken, salted meat/veggie fried rice.  We also order the siu long bau and pot stickers.  They were quite good.  The only disappointment was the sticky rice."}
{"text":"Foods are cold. Not authentic at all. I have no idea why it deserved more then one star. ??, D ???? ..."}
{"text":"A good place to bring your non-Chinese friends or colleagues as they offer a good selection of Northern Chinese cuisine as well as the easy-to-please Beef with Broccoli. Price tend to be slightly higher than the average  Chinese restaurant. Some notable dishes include Moo Shoo Chicken, Hot and Sour Soup, Dumplings and Shanghai Noodles. Make sure you print the coupon that entitles you to a free order of dumplings!"}
{"text":"Tried the food here a few times... Worst food poisoning experience every time I come here. I ordered their Lion Head lunch box and dry salty shrimp and scrambled eggs. Both tasted fine then as soon as I got to a nearest restroom I puked a few times then had the worst symptoms of food poisoning. Please be advised and go try it with a strong stomach."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Dined here a few times I find it an very good choice in and around the First Markham area. 

I've had:

Crab and Pork Dumplings - made proper with a thin casing, taste is good. only restaurant i've seen this dumpling. 
Green Onion Pancake - quite excellent ranks very highly
House Special Vermicelli Noodle - this is good selection of mixed vegetables and meat. 
Beef Tenderloin - Sizzling on an Iron Cow plate. Hilarious and cute. 

One comment the decor could be more inspiring. On the walls and ceilings are bamboo dim sum baskets. Ho hum.."}
{"text":"Can't say that I would ever come again or recommend to others.  So many other Shanghai cuisine restaurants that are better.  And the service is absolutely atrocious!!"}
{"text":"I only come here once every 5 months since it's a bit out of my way, but the food at A La Kitchen is consistent and good. That means something, since many other places start of great and then go downhill. The prices are decent and the food is average for Shanghainese fare. Definitely prefer coming here than Asian Legend!

Came here for dinner tonight with a group of 6 and waited about 20 minutes for a table. We got a table in the back corner, which was nice because we weren't smushed in the middle of the place and it wasn't as noisy. It can be a bit cramped since the place is small.

Things that are good here (in no particular order):

- Fried duck (Item D8A on the menu; $12.50) - a bit salty but delicious. Every table around us also order this.
- Shanghai Noodle (J7; $6.99) - After sitting for 20 mins, still no oil had congealed on the plate. A sure sign of good skill on a fairly simple dish! I didn't find this sweet as all (re: Katrina L's review).
- Hot & sour soup (B1; $6.99) - Regular size was more than plenty for 6. My friend who loves H&S soup approved of this dish.
- Xiao Long Bao (Pork Dumpling - L2; $3.80/ 4 pcs). Good, not great. Still searching for the perfect xiao long bao. 
- Green Onion Cake (L16; $2.55) - eat it while it's hot!
- Mash Red Bean (the gao li dou sha mentioned below. M2 on the menu; $4.99/4 pcs)
- Red bean cake (M7; $3.55)

We ordered 2 desserts and I didn't find them too sweet. The gao li dou sha is sprinkled with sugar and you can brush most of it off - that takes away 80% of the sweetness. 

FYI they don't take credit cards.
FYI 2 - if you are sensitive to MSG, be aware... I finished dinner around 9:30pm and I'm still awake right now and have dry mouth - and it's 7:30am!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty weird...

Been to a lot of chinese restaurants and this is probably one of the weirdest
Don't know how to really describe the food...not your typical chinese restaurant. 

Crab and beans? Wow what a combo

We got this dish where it was like a huge pork joint but it was mostly fat. 
80% pure wiggly jelly like pork fat, and it was covered in this red sauce that just tasted ...like fermented something. Weird... really weird.   

The dessert was a head scratcher deep friend balls with banana inside. Okay that sounds good....BUT! when you cut inside you find this slimy egg white coating. It was like eating a cake where the eggs weren't beaten properly and had baked a egg white patch... When I ate it can't help but think it was good.... yet gross at the same time

The saving grace are their steamed pork buns, those are nice and juicy and full of good flavour and they taste normal. 

."}
{"text":"Not a bad restaurant at all. One thing I am a bit irritated about is not accepting credit cards. Our meal was $200 they expect cash or debit .... Seriously??"}
{"text":"I prefer this place much better than the rip off ding tai Fung across the plaza. The food is amazing and it's not as crowded as ding tai Fung. Only downside is that I get very thirsty afterward. I would assume this place uses a lot of msg."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 8/10
Food: 8.5/10
Atmosphere: 7/10
Service: 8/10

To note, all ratings above are in relation to other Asian restaurants. A \"7/10\" atmosphere would certainly not be given when compared to white tablecloth Italian restaurants, but Ala Kitchen is fine and adheres to the Asian standard.

The food comes out quickly and piping hot. The service is fast and efficient. You'll definitely find your Northern Chinese staples here and they'll be sure to satisfy you: hot and sour soup, soup dumplings, green onion pancake, rice cakes, etc. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: will satisfy your cravings in a usual fast-paced Asian restaurant setting."}
{"text":"The food was not good at all (way too salty) and it is not cheap either. I am very disappointed because I have heard that it used to be good and decided to give it a try. I do not recommend this place, do not waste your money. The service is okay but not great either. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for having dim sum or dishes from the north part of China. The dumplings are especially good and the desserts are not bad neither."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on Sunday afternoon. It was so difficult to find parking in this plaza as majority of the parking spots are 'reserved'. Even tho it was weekend and a lot of the nearby businesses were closed we did not want to risk it. Once we got in, we got seated very quickly. Not much talk from the waitresses. The paper menu where you tick you choices are in chinese only. Howver they do give you a menu book with pictures and the english translations, you just have to match up the #. We opted for a beef pancake, it came wrapped in tinfoil as expected. It's one of he more popular choices. Howver the price of the beef pancake was more expensive compared to other restauarants - I think nearly $7-8. I love to get their steam buns. It always comes with a sweet condensed milk dipping. Only $4.5 here.  We usually get their Shanghai fried noodles. very good. We get it every time. 
As wel their siu long baos are very good too. And their pan fried dumplings too. The only downside with these are they come in very small portions. Only 4 per plate. At other restaurants you may get 6-8 for the same price. 
All in all, service was as expected they refilled our teas 2 times promptly. The bill was accurate. It was a good environment to catch up with my fam. Quick service too. 
I will come back. (If I find parking lol)"}
{"text":"As far as Chinese Shanghai cuisine goes, this place is pretty spot on.

The Pan Fried Dumplings was quite meaty and does seem like they made it themselves. The Shanghai noodles were done right and was not oily at all.  The Shanghai noodles in soup with beef briskets was okay but not as tasty as other places.  However the pieces of brisket we got were not fatty at all so that was a definitely a plus.  The steam dumplings were done perfectly and was meaty and juicy as well.  The last thing we ordered was the glutinous rice roll with the fried bread stick in the middle.  I honestly don't think it was that good, but other people thought was great.  I'll have to order it again next time and judge it again.  The restaurant is very clean and the wait staff was very friendly which is always a plus!

All in all 4 out of 5 items were good so the experience was a success in my books!"}
{"text":"This is a safe spot for xiaolongbao and other shanghainese fare. As the other reviewers had already spoken  to, the food is comforting but forgettable. With other Shanghainese places reputedly \"going downhill\" in terms of quality, A La Kitchen is still surviving. Not being a resident of Toronto, I relish every chance I get to indulge in Shanghai food and A La Kitchen is a safe way to fill that craving. 

Some other interesting dishes I had a chance to try during my latest visit were the crispy rice, and mutton cake."}
{"text":"Location/Service
- It's right across First Markham Place, a newly built plaza. Plenty of parking available, and you can leverage the FMP parking lot as well
- Spacious restaurant and can accommodate big groups. Inside is also pretty bright, making use of the big windows. They have Chinese-themed related decorations, which is pretty nice and fitting to the atmosphere/vibe
-  Staff were nice, attentive and detailed on making sure what we ordered

Food
- Xiao Long Bao. Juicy, thin wrapping. Bite sized so you can taste all everything in one. The meat is mixed well and compliments nicely
- Fried dumplings. Typical and standard with other places. It's not over fried that the skin becomes tough to chew on
- Shanghai Noodle. Again, typical and standard. Pretty good portion to share. Consistency of noodle and meat as well
- ??? (not sure English name). It's broccoli with egg whites, crab meat and a raw egg yolk in the middle. This is one of my favourite dishes, especially once you mix it all together. Everything blends so well. Egg Whites are fluffy and broccoli are fresh and crunchy
- ??? (dongpo pork). Also another one my favourite dish. It's braised pork belly with bak choy. The pork is braised to the right level, juicy and tender. Obviously since it's belly, there's a layer of fat - and it compliments so well


This is sort of to-go place for Shanghai food, so I always try a lot of different dishes. I like how they have a wide variety of menu items for you to explore. They also take reservations and it does get pretty busy during peak hours!"}
{"text":"Recently visited this location tucked behind the Ding Tai Fung plaza at Woodbine and Highway 7 in Markham for a Winter Solstice Eat-up with a hungry crew of GTA Yelpers. 

It's a nice enough place but given the staff, patrons and menu's it would be damn near impossible to visit this place WAA (Without Asian Assistance). Thank goodness I was with a crew of seasoned Shanghai foodie vets (Jen K and Wayne). 

The feast we attacked was a monster with many courses and one of the differences between Shanghai style cuisine and other areas of China that I really enjoyed was their use of steamed buns instead of rice or noodles.

Here is a rundown of our Chinese Winter Solstice Eat Up (according to menu #):

D1 Shanghai Baked Special Whole Chicken $36.00 (aka Beggar's Chicken) 
- This was incredible as it requires an order ahead of time so to bake inside a bread like shell for 7 hours. The result was fall off the bone meat. well seasoned

D8 Special Deep Fried Duck $26.00
- Far and away my fave part of the meal. The 1/2 duck was deep fried and diced, the seasoning and the way it was cooked eliminated the overly gamey taste of the duck letting it's more delicious flavour qualities shine.

C7 Braised Shredded Eel $18.99
- This meal sounds more intense then it was. The Eel (when you could find a piece) was good and the sauces it sat in were good but I found this to be more filler (veggies and the like) then eel. 

C13 Sweet and Sour Boneless Whole Yellow Fish $23.99
- I could take this meal or leave it. The whole fish tasted lovely and the veggies combined with the orange sauce gave it a bright colour. However, not being a fan of Chinese Take-out style sweet and sour sauce (which essentially was what it reminded me of) ruined this dish. Less sauce or sauce on side next time and this would be a winner.

F2 Dong Po Meat Lotus Leaf Wrapped $10.99
- I really enjoyed this dish. Pork Belly with giant Bok Choi veggies. Delicious. Protip, you have to take a whole piece not just the meat layer the fat and sinew make each mouthful a party!

J1 A LA House Special Fried Rice Cake with Pork $10.99
- Don't recall this meal - therefore I assume it was forgettable. If this was the meal with glutenous rice (which I believe it was) there is no meat in this dish so don't think you are getting any. Blahhh... bland... had a spoonful to try (not a fan).

M1 Crispy Deep Fried Banana with Honey   $8.99
- This was AMAZING!!! Banana coated in molten sugar needing to be cooled in a vat of cold water at the table. Crystallized sugar and banana made this a fave dessert which I plan on attempting to make on my own. YUMMM!

M3 Deep Fried Egg White Ball with Mashed Sesame (4) $6.99
- shudder. what a horrible way to end my meal. Eggy buns deep fried and coated in sugar injected with hot sesame paste (black). Just unpleasant for me all the way around. 

Next time I'd rather save room for more Duck and Pork Belly.

Honest review 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"So far I've found the Shanghainese food in Toronto quite unimpressive. This place follows that trend. It really is... average. 

The highlight (actually more accurate description is \"least medicore\") dish was the kung pao chicken. Although that did have way too many peanuts. But tasted okay. 

The xlb were decent as well. 

I can't  remember the names of the other dishes, but most were a little too salty. 

The best thing about this place is that it shares a big parking lot. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Pretty much love Shanghai food, as it's one of the few Asian cuisine I do like. A La Kitchen is one of the better ones in my book as well! 

Usually head over here for lunch, but parking is pretty much a hassle if you come at a busy time. There is only 1 row of spots in front of the restaurant, so you may actually have to park quite far and walk over. The space inside is quite large, and can seat quite a few people, but like most other restaurants in the area, you will probably have to wait for a table on the weekends. 

Overall, the typical Shanghai dishes here are quite good. The Spicy Peanut Noodles are thin without losing texture, and the soup is a good combination of spicy and nutty. The Spicy Beef Noodle is good as well, with the beef nice and tender in a mildly spicy soup base. The Shanghai Noodles are always a fan favourite with lots of ingredients. Just make sure you ask for less oil, as it can seem like it's swimming in oil by the end of your meal. Lastly, the dumplings are all quite good here. Thin skin with soup inside. Have had some days come out with lukewarm soup, so beware and eat ASAP!

A good place if you're in the area and craving some Shanghai food! Definitely a sold 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Came to A La Kitchen around 8pm on a Sunday night and the tables were pretty much all filled. My party of 3 waited for about 5 minutes as the waiters scurried to clear a table for us.

One of my favourites from A La that's a MUST order is the Braised Beef Noodle Soup ($8.99). The broth is slightly spicy and very flavourful. The kitchen gives you a generous amount of beef for the price (4 to 5 pieces per bowl) and the noodles are cooked to perfection.

We also ordered pan fried pork dumplings ($5.75) and they were super crunchy on the outside, but the meat was definitely juicy and hot!

Although we didn't order steamed pork dumplings ($5.25), they are also among one of my favourite dishes here. They have soup inside the dumplings and you add a little bit of the vinegar on the table to it. The vinegar they have there brings out the flavours and it's like a hot and flavourful explosion in your mouth - so definitely be careful of the soup explosion!

We will continually come back here just because of the deliciousness of the food!"}
{"text":"After my meal today, I realized I really like food! having both quality and quantity was definitely the theme here at A La Kitchen. Will need to return to try the rest of the menu when I've had time for my tummu to rest."}
{"text":"For a Shanghainese themed restaurant, the Xiao Long Bao (soup dumpling) were pretty underwhelming. Thick skin, little filling, lacked flavour and not a lot of soup in it. Also 4 soup dumpling per steam-basket, is a little less then what other restaurants generally offer. I would have forgave them in the small quantity if it was reflected in the price (it wasn't).

There's so many good Shanghainese resturants in Toronto that offer much better flavour profiles and value, so defiantly not coming back."}
{"text":"I recently came to A la kitchen for a veritable feast of epic proportions. Jen K. and Wayne C. organized a Chinese eat-up in honour of the winter solstice. We yelpers got to try several dishes, the rundown is as follows: 

The Amazing: 
- IMO only 1 dish tonight really blew me away and surprisingly that was dessert (I am not a huge fan of Chinese dessert). This dish was the caramelized deep fried banana which really hit the spot. The banana came to our table hot from the fryer and covered in honey (or sugar?) and was promptly finished table side by being placed in a bowl of ice water to harden the outside. Very cool presentation! The result was a crunchy and gooey cornucopia of sugary goodness. The sugar on the outside reminded me of a candy apple; it had a nice crunch and great flavour. The banana was deep-fried to perfection. Excellent dish! 

The Good
- Beggars chicken (must order in advance): A stuffed chicken baked inside a loaf of bread for 7 hours, this resulted in a chicken that was falling off the bone. The dark meat was quite tender but the white meat pieces were still a little bit dry. The sauce it was served with had a bit of sweetness which I enjoyed. All in all a unique dish.
 
- Braised shredded eel: served with a lot of sauce which I believe was a soy sauce. The eel had a good texture, and the sauce was a little sweet. The excess sauce made for a good opportunity to dip some steamed buns into. 

The OK
- Deep fried duck: skin was crispy and not too oily; however it was a little bit too salty. There was no depth of flavour; the only think one tasted was salt. This is similar to other Chinese fried chicken dishes I have had and this dish was pretty standard fare IMO. 

- Pork belly with lotus leaf: Big slabs of pork belly with bok choy and lotus leaves served in a clay pot. This dish was a little disappointing; the fat on the pork belly was not melt in your mouth. The result was a rather unpleasant chunk of fat on the palate. 

- Sweet and sour boneless yellow fish: This dish was once again standard fare. A deep-fried fish served in a neon red sweet and sour sauce. The breading and sauce overpowered the flavour of the fish. The sauce was your standard sweet and sour sauce, nothing special. You can probably get this quality dish at any Chinese restaurant around.

The Bad
- Fried rice cake with pork: This dish was bland, not much going on in terms of flavour. I tend to enjoy rice cakes but these were a bit too chewy. I've definitely had better. 

- Deep fried egg white ball with mashed black sesame: This was another of our dessert dishes. Generally I am not a big fan of black sesame; I dislike the texture and am not a fan of the flavour, this dish was no exception. I also did not like the egg white ball the black sesame was in, the taste of the egg white was too strong and very off-putting for dessert. Go for the deep-fried banana for dessert its much better.

Besides the food, the restaurant is quite clean and modern. It was not very busy on a Tuesday evening but apparently gets busy on weekends. The restaurant is located in a plaza directly behind first Markham place which means you do not have to deal with the nightmare of parking at First Markham, bonus! The servers were quite friendly, always making sure we had clean plates and obliging my fellow yelpers' need to take pictures. Overall my experience here was satisfactory but fell short of amazing."}
{"text":"We came here a few times when Ding Tai Fungs line ups were just ridiculous... the food here is Shanghai style as well.

The main dishes are ok, some are very oily. However the four stars are highly deserved for their deep fried egg white souffles with sesame filling. DTF offers the same but with only red bean and while i like both, I prefer black sesame."}
{"text":"Came here for a large family dinner on Easter weekend. The restaurant was surprisingly not packed but we had made a reservation beforehand anyways.

We chose not to do the set courses they offer and ordered a la carte from the menu. My favorite dish was actually from their \"secret menu\", which a family friend told us about. It was essentially braised beef with bean curd knots, I highly recommend this dish.

Prices are very reasonable and the Shanghainese cuisine they specialize in is authentic and tasty. Service was lackluster but not anything out of the ordinary. Would definitely come again but definitely a family-style restaurant and not for small parties."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a saturday night, and it is was packed to the brim. Thankfully we had made reservations for our group, so the wait was minimal.

this restaurant is a Shanghai cuisine style one. It is amazing that one of these is built so close to a ding tai fung. which is a major international restaurant. that serves the same type of food. However after trying it i can see why. First of all Ding tai Fung is not what is used to be, which is probably why this places is so packed during dinner time. 

We sat down and tried the food. Most of the dishes were pretty good, the exception are the soup dumplings that are famous shanghai cuisine, which i found is average. The other dishes really are pretty good, the ones that standout would be a mo shu pork/chicken, which is a pretyy good rendition where they did it with marinated fillings, and therefore you did not need to dip the hoisin sauce with it. as well the snowpea was great.  

overall the food and the restaurant environment was decent, the price was not extreme, and the restaurant was clean cut. its definetely a more family friendly or large group restaurant. 

i would recommend people try this one with a larger group, as this is the type of food where you want to try more diversity and share."}
{"text":"This place isn't as good aa it once was. Seems like it's going down hill now. The Shanghai fried noodles was a little soggy and the sauce was kinda wet when Shanghai fried noodles should be a dry stir fry. The dumplings didn't taste as good as before. Had this weird taste that I couldn't wrap my hands around what taste it was. The only good dish that I had was the jelly fish. The restaurant is nice and clean with ice Decor. I wouldn't mind coming back but it wouldn't be my first choice of Shanghai food to go to.."}
{"text":"We frequent A La quite often or at least we used to until the one at Pacific Mall opened at Steeles and Kennedy. We are only 5 minutes away from this location yet we will drive the 15-20 minutes for better food and service. This past lunch really did it. We were in a rush and asked 3 times for them to check on our pan fried dumplings. They told us they'd check in it. One waiter who is new seemed like he didn't understand a word we said in Cantonese but he still nodded and said, \"OK\". Finally after finishing all of our other food, we asked one of the regular waitresses to check for us and to cancel the order if it wasn't ready since we really had to leave. She came back to say it was only a minute longer. We insisted that we couldn't wait but she said it was already made. So we reluctantly waited and it was at least another 5 minutes. We had to pack it up (which like most Chinese food it doesn't taste the same as a leftover). We were very disappointed in the service as we were late for our appointment. Definitely not going to go to this location very often anymore."}
{"text":"A la is the first real Shanghai restaurant introduced by Shanghai friend back in 2012. Loved their \"Shanghai \" or southern Chinese dishes like cold starters, braised pork belly, crispy duck, spring rolls(never ordered this before since it's quite stuffy and I always wanna try the best dishes); beef rolls are served in lots of Chinese restaurants, theirs are crispy and delicious too.
Desserts are worth trying, some fish dishes (the ones that made from fresh fish) are good.
It's one of those restaurants we'd bring guests, friends and LOs to."}
{"text":"I came here with my family. Again, not knowing specifics of what I was eating. But this place specializes in Shanghai style Chinese food (there wasn't a category for that). I love Shanghai food, so the true test for me is to try their Shanghai styled noodles. Had them, forgot them. That's how good they were. I just remember them being too sweet. Really? Sweet? That is not how noodles are to be made. It is not a dessert, it's dinner. 

We just so happened to know our waitress through a friend of a friend and when the owner wasn't looking kept telling us to not eat there and that the food wasn't great. Uhh, that's always comforting when the chick that is supposed to be promoting this place meaning more business meaning more tips tells you that the food isn't that great. 

It was a bit on the pricey side (for Asian food, probably what you would call 'normal' pricing for other food) and as such, we have never gone back. We were referred there from a family friend and I have then learned that her taste buds are on the sweet side and she loves this place. So, if you love having sugar in your food, well then this is the place to go. But if you want your food to taste well, like food and not dessert and are looking for a cheap meal, this is definitely not the place for you."}
{"text":"This is a great, always busy restaurant in a 'newish' industrial condo mall. It features a good variety of Chinese dishes, but what distinguishes it are the many 'special' complete meals for 2, 4 or 6. Please note that this restaurant is always full at most times of day.

On our last visit the two of us ordered the following:

Hot and Sour Soup
This is served in a non-symmetrical bowl with a handle through the side. I makes for an attractive presentation, and the soup was piping hot, well seasoned and totally delicious. The 'portion' yields about 5 or 6 small eating bowls and shrimps were present in the mix aplenty.

Pan Fried Beef Dumplings (4)
These had a tasty stuffing, were fresh and well prepared, and were not soggy.

Fried Crispy Beef with Chili Sauce
This was a delicious offering, with a 'melt in your mouth' taste, and a nice crispy finish. This is an outstanding dish.

Braised Eggplant with Minced Pork
This is a classic and was delicious. The small eggplants were tender, not watery, well spiced and very tasty. The pork was a nice component of this dish and was not (as it often is) dry and crumbly. 

The whole meal was accompanied by Chinese Tea. This particular special menu allows you to choose from 1 Soup, 1 Appetizer, and 2 Dishes accompanied by 2 steamed rice. We only opted for 1 steamed rice.

This mini feast cost less than $ 25.00 and it was worth every penny. We have been there on a number of occasions and we will continue to support this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from family friends. The food was just...okay.

We ordered the set for four - $50 for one soup, one appetizer, three sides, and one rice or noodle.

The soup and rice dishes were generous, appetizer was as expected, and the sides (drenched in hoisin sauce, soy sauce, and thickened with corn starch, but reasonably tasty) were quite a bit smaller than what you would get for the same price at other restaurants (or maybe it was because we had the set). The dishes came in a really strange order. Soup first, then the sides, and the appetizer sometime between sides, and then we waited a good 10 or 15 minutes before the main dish came!

I don't know if I'd come back here again, it's kind of far from where I live... But again, the food was..okay."}
{"text":"I saw pictures of the soup dumplings on instagram and I was intrigued. However it didn't live up to expectations I had.  The dumplings are filled with a lot of soup which is great, but the flavor isn't exactly there. I also found the brisket noodle soup lacked flavor as well. I felt like I can find these dishes elsewhere but with better quality at a cheaper cost. I also tried their pan fried dumpling and I was certainly surprised because when I bit into it, a lot of soup splattered out. It got all over the food and I wasn't that impressed. I will probably not come back here because I felt the service and food was just mediocre."}
{"text":"The food at this location tastes very good. Must come 10/10. Best food in Markham. Dumplings are phenomenal. Beef brisket noodle soup tastes amazing. The service there is amazing. Everyone is so kind and works very quickly. Washroom facilities are very clean."}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't even have knew this place is here if I wasn't brought here by someone who knew where it was.  It's tucked behind First Markham Place in what kinda looks like an office complex.

This place (regardless of it's deceiving name) serves Szechuan chinese food.  So you're talking about dumplings, hot and sour soup, and spicy chunky beef noodle soup.  I ordered exactly that.  They also have this lunch combo at 28 dollars that includes, soup, an app, and 2 entree plates.  We also got one of those.

The hot and sour soup was not terrible, but it did taste watered down.  It seemed like every other table had ordered one (cause it comes in the same ikea looking bowl).  It didn't really have any body in it so I wasn't really a big fan of it.

The fried pork dumplings were actually not too bad.  My only disappointment is that they only had red vinegar on the table, which is kinda odd for a Szechuan place.  it's usually the opposite.  The dumplings were actually pretty juicy inside and the dough was a nice consistency.  A pretty safe order.

The spicy chunky beef noodle was not terrible... but not exactly good either.  The beef was pretty tender which was nice, but it was weird that they used thick Szechuan noodles instead of their thinner counterparts.  Otherwise, there wasn't anything special about the soup base.

We also had the minced pork with fried beans (not sure if this is what it's called).  The flavour was great, but the beans were kinda soggy and not crunchy. 

All in all, I think the best way to describe Ala Kitchen is chinese fast food in a food court, but in a fancy renovated restaurant.  In an area that is flooded by chinese restaurants, you can probably do better."}
{"text":"Expensive...expensive...expensive...

We got a set dinner...dinner for four...it gave a choice of a main dish, a noodle, an appetizer...

Now when you eat at a chinese restaurant, set dinners have full sized dishes...not here....we thought it was very unusual that aside from the soup, the main, appetizers were all small.  I asked the server if our dishes were full size and she said no...basically when you eat here, these set menus are more of a sampling menu...a pricey one at that.

They have the fried donut with choice of red bean or sesame paste...it's nice but at $2 each it's a bit expensive...

The best value and taste was the beef noodle soup.  Came here twice and don't think we'll be back.  The Xie Long bao's are good but not filling and again, expensive."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night,  the place is only half full. Food were not that tasty and on the salty side. Had the Shanghai fried Rice cake, its just salty. Fried duck, too dry. Pork and tofu soup, which comes with lots of tasteless fat meat. Pan fried dumplings,  green onions pancake, and other vege dishes are just average. I rather go to Ding Tai Fung next door."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with the fiance and some friends. The food was alright. It was only semi busy at around 7:30pm. Service was good and quick.

We ordered a bunch of dishes to share at the table. The jellyfish app was a little bland, and the chicken with peanut sauce was only ok. I've had better. The braised beef tendon app was pretty good though, nice and spicy and tender.

The dish I did not like was the house special fried rice. The fried rice itself was good but the sauce and toppings on it was.. a little weird. There were mushrooms and fish balls and I dunno.. a bunch of weird stuff in a brown sauce. And they topped it off with an over cooked fried egg.

I don't think I would suggest this place to eat, but at the same time if my party wanted to eat there I wouldn't mind.. it's alright."}
{"text":"I'll come here whenever I'm craving for Shanghai noodle.  Their Shanghai noodle is the best!  They use nice dark soy sauce and generous portion of cabbage.  5 stars for the noodle but all other dishes are just average.  Servers weren't that attentive, and 3 stars for the service.  They have lunch special @$8.99 which come with rice, appetizer, soup or soy milk; add $1 for veggie with rice.  It came in a bento; nice presentation!"}
{"text":"I am a big big fan of their Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - if it is not a signature dish then it really should be a signature dish! In my opinion, the only place in town that can make their noodle soup so good.

Apart from that, their mantaos are really good and is also my favourite dish. Two keys item I would get every time I come to visit this location. Also note that there is one in the Pacific Mall upstairs but it is not as good as the standalone by First Markham Place.

Lots of different specialties and food options to choose from as well but I would keep to the same dishes every time I come."}
{"text":"Ordered:
Drunken chicken,
Fried tofu, $4.99;
Noodles with fried pork chop, $7.99.
Pork cake.
Pork belly dish with 4 buns.
Steamed soup dumplings.

Nothing special, very busy, reasonable prices.

Cash only YET without the 10% discount offered by other restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning. We were the first ones there so service was quite fast. 

Pork dumpling (xiao long bao) $5.25 - you get 4 large soup dumplings. They are much larger in size when comparing with other Shanghai restaurants but I don't think this is really a good thing. I'd rather get 6 smaller sized ones which I can just pop in my mouth whole. 

Beef pancake $6.99 - not as good as other places I have tried.

Fried pork buns $5.75 - comes with four buns. Very juicy on the inside with a nice crisp fried bottom.

Fried pork dumplings $5.75 - comes with four dumplings. Good but nothing really worth noting here. 

Braised beef noodle $8.99 - beef was soft and tender with lots of beef to be had. Noodles had a nice chew and soup was good enough to drink.

Black sesame rice ball served in sugar water $6.50 - you get six large pieces in one serving. They were super fresh. Soft and silky smooth and not overly sweet. Simply the best. A perfect little dessert. 

Overall, I though the food was good but there are other Shanghai restaurants that do it better. The black sesame rice balls were amazing though and was the best dish we had.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Not sure why the other yelper gave 1 star but I think this is good place for Shanghai food. Service is good too. The beef noodle is exceptional good and I ordered everytime I come."}
{"text":"3.5.

The crab and pork dumplings is definitely something you should try. Ding Tai Fung only has pure pork, but the crab is a nice addition. Bigger as well.

Green onion pancake is okay, though I enjoy DTF's more.

Everything else is pretty much what you expect from the price you pay.

One thing that drove me nuts was the lack of legroom in the booths (and I'm a VERY small guy!). I had to move around quite a lot.

Free wifi!"}
{"text":"Went there with another family frm Shanghai and we overall enjoyed our experience as there was a decent variety of signature Shanghainese dishes. Snack items like pot stickers and shiu long baos were good. ???? and ?? were also highlights. The biggest disappointment was ???? - $27.99 was simply unjustifiable by the overly sweet sauce and heavily breaded fish which did not taste fresh at all. I would recommend to stay away from that dish and maybe go for the steamed whole fish instead, which, take note, needs to be pre-ordered by phone 24 hours in advance."}
{"text":"Nice decor but pricy and not worth the money. Usually when you get the shanghai dumplings it's usually 6 pieces, we got 4 for $5.49 that's more than a dollar a piece and it's just average tasting, the lunch special pictures look delicious but it doesn't show the portion size which is smallll....I only for 2 pieces of dong po.......I was still hungry after my lunch special and usually at chinese places I always have leftovers to take home"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 8 people at 6:30PM on a Saturday and was seated right away.. they have plenty of seating in the restaurant and it was never at capacity.. though I'd still call to ensure you get a round table for larger parties.

At the beginning, I felt a little rushed to order as the waitress kept suggesting the set menus (which includes only either or choices, and only single orders of soup filled dumplings (4 pcs) which isn't enough for everyone to share...).. ended up ordering items separately to ensure we could have everything we wanted!

The food came fast and we devoured it quick! Overall, everything was delicious.. most notable dishes we got were the soup filled dumplings and sweet & sour fish.

A la kitchen is slightly pricey but the food never disappoints. We also brought a cake to celebrate a birthday that evening and the staff were very nice about it..clearing our table and providing plates, lighting the candle for us.

I would safely say this is my go-to place for Shanghainese food.. although I do wish some dishes would be larger portions for the price (ie. the soup dumplings and some desserts only come in portions of 4)."}
{"text":"A La Kitchen is my goto restaurant for shanghai food. They have the staple \"beef brisket noodle soup\" which itself is 5 star. There's not another place comparable to it. They have great side dishes such as dumplings, Siu loan balance many others. 

Priced are reasonable. Expect around $10 per dish with adequate service. Typical chinese restaurant atmosphere. Highly recommend for others to try."}
{"text":"Saturday 6pm, still plenty of parking. Its a corner unit.  Looks big from the outside. 
Service and Staff was friendly enough. No complaints here.

Food was ... not bad., but nothing i tried made me wanting more.  It was just ok.

Took a few pictures of what we had here, and like i said, nothing i tried was fantastic.
Will i go back... not sure.

Maybe i'm just not a fan of Shanghai food.
Worth a try?... yes
Service - 4 stars
Food - ok"}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas eve when the restaurant my friend and I were going to go to was fully booked. I don't know why this is under \"Asian fusion\" since it's a pretty typical Chinese restaurant. In fact, A La Kitchen is pretty much what I want from a Chinese restaurant: decent food for a decent price, large enough space so that you have some privacy, and a clean and pleasant interior. 

I liked their  more than most other places -- good noodle texture, soup not too oily but still flavourful.

Service was fine. I'm not looking to be babysat or seduced by the service at a place like this. Our waiter didn't seem fazed by our table's mixed communication of Cantonese, Mandarin and English, haha.

It's not -so- amazing that I'd tell all my friends that they have to eat here, or anything, but it's comfort food done well.

Oh yeah, also usually a sign of a good Chinese restaurant: the tea is hot and not watered down."}
{"text":"Very mediocre place. Food is more expensive than your average chinese restaurant. Got the specialty fried rice... did not know it was a saucy fried rice... I did not touch it at all. If I had known it was a wet fried rice, wouldn't have gotten it. Also got the fried rice cakes. Never had this before. It tasted interesting, but as I kept eating it, tasted very mechanical or chemical like... Literally every thing including the meat tasted like it... It was weird. 

Also, most of the plates served on were chipped. Did not like eating off chipped plates."}
{"text":"Bland and boring! There other location is okay but this one isn't better and not even as good. Dumplings lack flavour and taste made from frozen...the dumpling wrap is a bit too thick. The xiao long bao is bland as well. Service was good though, except they don't take credit cards! It was a rare day I brought my cash wallet otherwise I never bring out my debit or have cash on me. 

Not going back!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for the quality of food. 

The gao li red bean dessert was pretty good but I'm sure you can find the same elsewhere for like half the price. (It's 9 bucks here for 4 pieces).

Their special, the deep fried duck was also disappointing. Didn't have much flavour, and was literally just some dry-tasting fried duck. Oh and it was 18.50 for half of one. 

The fried rice was good and the soup was good. Giant meatball dish was just okay."}
{"text":"I love shanghai cuisine but can't find any superior restaurant in Toronto.  A La Kitchen is quite ok among some of the SH restaurants I tried b4.  One thing that I don't like is that if someone is waiting for a table and if u r nearly done, they seem to ask u pay the bill and get the table ready for the next customers.......
 I like dining there because they have the black sesame deep fried egg white that most of the SH restaurants don't have."}
{"text":"The guy above is crazy; this place was fantastic.    It was jam packed at 9:30pm on a Thursday night with Chinese customers which is always a good sign that you are about to eat something good."}
{"text":"Came by yesterday night for a really late dinner. I couldn't find the exact restaurant name to check in. 

We got the pork soup dumplings (xiao long bao) and it came very juicy and soupy! Unfortunately, for the price it came just 4 soup dumplings. 

Everything else was ok. 

The a/c wasn't on.... And having hot soup dishes didn't make it easier."}
{"text":"nothing that really makes this place stand out over other chinese restaurants in a good way. everything was pretty average. my biggest takeaway was the poor service."}
{"text":"We came here because DTF had a long wait line. For the vegetarians in our group it was a three star but for the non-vegetarians who ordered primarily Xiao Lin bow it was a four star experience.  Service was good and friendly"}
{"text":"Located right behind the busy First Markham Place mall, this eatery/ restaurant serves up some of Toronto's most authentic Shanghai dishes.  There is plenty of parking and seating is not crammed.  Service is very friendly and dishes are very yummy and economical.  Lots to try from shanghai dim sum to family style dishes."}
{"text":"Great food... Extremely rude wait staff!

Seriously, when there are so many empty tables why are they forcing me to sit on the table next to the toilet?  Furthermore, the same wait staff who is fluent in English to other (Caucasian) customers kept talking to me in Cantonese. 

1.  i can't learn a new language within the course of one meal
2.  It doesn't matter how loud you are yelling to me in Cantonese, I still can't understand you!!

::banging my head against the wall::"}
{"text":"I absolutely hate this place.  We made reservations here twice and both times, the owners gave up our reservations to give to their friends.  The servers are extremely rude (even by Chinese standards).

I will never ever bother to come back here again.  Their food isn't even that good, I have no idea why the line up is always so long, maybe because it's cheap.  Anyways, I would rather pay more and go to other restaurants in the FMP area that deal with their incredibly rude servers that lack the integrity to hold a reservation. 

DO NOT DINE HERE"}
{"text":"This is an overall good Shanghainese food restaurant. Most of the food I have tried has been good, with the exception of the fried beef strips. They have a great hot and sour soup and multiple sizes of all their soups which is convenient. The dumplings (Siu Long Bao) are average but not as good as some of its competitors. The service is quick and the restaurant is spacious, so overall I think it's a decent choice for family dinners. Nothing amazing but reliable and consistent."}
{"text":"A La Kitchen food quality is no comparsion to Ding Tai Fai! However there are a few dishes that A La Kitchen is better!

I really enjoy the Chicken Wonton Soup! This is one of the few places I know of that you can order a smaller size ($7.99) which is prefect for 2 person. However that are not enough chicken pieces or vegetables in it. The wonton though is really nice, has 4 big ones which are filled with chives and pork ;).

The Mash Seasame I think it is the best here compare to Asian Legends. This is the only place I know of can has the fillings with black seasame. You need to preorder that when you order your main course. They are prepared freshly and served hot hot hot! $4.80 for 4 big ones! This is the must order for me whenever I visit.

However the green beans with minced pork tastes like something that i made in my own kitchen (Jen's Kitchen), not spicy, tasted pretty bland. The beef has too much oyster sauce in it.. though I do enjoy the pancake wraps.

I have to agreed with Katrina L that the dishes were on the sweet size.

Cash or Interac only!"}
{"text":"We came here for some authentic Shanghai dishes with a group of friends. Restaurant is nice, clean, and bright. Service was fast and friendly. And the food was authentic. 
We ordered a number of dishes to share:
-  Drunken chicken and bean curds for appetizer. Drunken chicken was my least favorite. It was a bit bland IMO; alcohol was strong
-  Salted pork, fresh pork, tofu in soup (B8). I was told by my my friend that this is a very classic shanghai soup. I enjoyed soup very much. Broth was very flavourful. 
- Snow pea leaves with king mushroom: it was good, snow pea leaves were done perfect. 
- Deep fried duck with steamed buns: this was my favourite dish. Duck had really good flavour. The outside was crispy. The skin tastes so good!!!!!
- fried Shanghai noodles: pretty good. 
- sweet and sour pork chops: pork was cut into little pieces. Nice blend of sweet and savoury. 

And the trip to a shanghai restaurant wouldn't be compete with some Sui long bao.

- Sui long bao: comes in 4. It was nice and juicy. Very similar to the ones at Ding Tai fung
- pan fried dumplings, and green onion pancakes were decent as expected.


- Desserts: 1)  deep fried egg white balls with sesame this dish was a bit expensive, comes with 4 for $9; however it tastes fresh and very eggy. I would have liked it to have more sesame inside. 2) Deep fried red bean pancakes: small portion but very delish. Rich inside with red bean paste and nicely fried. I would order this again. 

Overall we had a good experience. Food was authentically good (some of the dishes portions are a bit small though). Service was efficient. Will return"}
{"text":"The food was not that authentic, tend to be on the sweeter side, including the string green beans and spicy fish fillet.  The braised bean curd appetizer was a bit too hard and not as seasoned as the better ones we have had before.  The crispy smoked fish tasted like straight from a can... Overall, was not impressed by the food quality."}
{"text":"The first time I came to A La Kitchen, I found the food to be bland and unmemorable. But I'm about giving second chances, so I came back again and ordered different dishes. 

To start off, we shared a large bowl of sweetened hot soy bean milk. I think I still prefer my soy milk chilled, but this was nice for a chilly day. The rice roll with dried and minced pork and fried dough stick, pan-fried dumplings and pan-fried pork buns were all pretty ordinary. My favorite was the fried Shanghai noodle, which was addictively greasy and super flavorful. I love the abundance of meat and veggies. Our dessert, deep fried egg white ball with mashed sesame, was pretty underwhelming, but it might have been because I was too full to enjoy it too much.

All in all, my experience at A La Kitchen was better than my previous one, but I was still not overly impressed by the food. I think that there are better Shanghai restaurants around the area."}
{"text":"went there on a weeknight around 10pm, thinking that they don't close till 1am (according to their listing on ccue.com), only to find out later that they were indeed closing at 10:30pm or so. was apologetic to the waiter upon finding out the updated closing time; he was pleasant and told us not to worry about it. the chefs and other wait staff were leaving one by one, but kudos to he who stayed and remained in good grace.

this is a new(er) place so they have a clean and modern design, which is pleasing to the eye. cost is about average; not very cheap but not outrageously expensive, either. food-wise, we ordered 3 things of appetizers, a noodle, and a dessert, details as follow--

appetizers:
1. \"xiao long bao\" (soup dumplings with crabmeat)--wasn't  tasting particularly \"crabby\", but the skin is soft and thin, and the soup and meat are flavorful. 

2. \"sheng jian bao\" (pan-fried meat buns from raw)--was rather disappointing. the bottom crust (spotlight of the dish) wasn't crunchy enough, and the meat and bun were not memorable otherwise. blah.

3. \"hong you chao shou\" (wonton in red/chilly sauce)--i liked it that it wasn't super spicy like some place would make it to be (or it was supposed to be quite spicy). their sauce has a certain amount of sweetness in it, paired with the chopped peanuts, it was an ok combo. wontons were cooked to satisfaction; the skin (wrapper) was soft and paper-thin. not super fantastic, but still good.

entree: 
\"shanghainese noodle\"--it was, again, nothing spectacular, but on par and as expected. 

dessert:
was deciding between the \"gao li dou sha\" (baked egg white w/red bean paste) and the \"ba si xiang jiao\" (deep fried banana dipped in honey/syrup); the latter which i chose didn't disappoint. though it seemed the banana could be fried just a tad longer (after the ice bath they were getting closer to warm than hot inside), and my bf stopped eating the crust after two pieces coz it might have been too sweet for him. but i liked it.  i liked the crust that's sweet and crunchy, contrasted with the warm mushy banana inside. having the waiter scoop the sticky pieces out of the dish and dump them into an ice bath is a spectacle in itself. highly recommend this dish for first-timers.

in all, food is about average, but fact that they took us minutes before closing without giving us attitude or rushing us out deserves an extra star in itself.  i love shanghainese food, and since i haven't tried out many of the other dishes (ex. soy bean milk and \"ci fan\"--sticky rice roll) here, i would definitely go back unless i'm greeted with a huge line.

i heard they can get quite busy during meal times so it's recommended to make reservations if you're planning to dine at peak hours. also, they are located at the new section behind the main plaza, so you can actually enter via Rodick Rd or through Yorktech Rd to avoid plaza traffic. another thing, they only take cash or debit; no credit card.
:)"}
{"text":"I would give this 3-3.5 star at most. My take away from this is that their dim sum is good, we ordered the ?????(Steamed Pork Dumpings) and ???? (Pork and Chives Dumplings)and that turned out alright. Tasty and soupy like it should be. But they were a little cheap on the vinegar dipping sauce, considering we ordered both baskets, normally you should get two dishes of the vinegar but instead we got barely one with only a few shred of ginger in it. 

The most disappoint dish was the \"A LA House Special Fried Rice Cake with Pork\" if you were to put your name on the dish, you would expect the dish to be rich in flavour and ingredient but what you got was fatty pork shreds, and minced vegetables (I think it is parsley and something else). I definitely would be ashamed to put my name on a dish like that and also not worth the price. 

For dessert we ordered \"Crispy Deep Fried Banana with Honey\" now that dish was well  made. It was good, strong flavour, crispy. I am guessing this dish was designed for four people... for two of us it was way too filling."}
{"text":"This place still stands. (See my original review) My family loves to come here as a casual go-to place for Shanghainese food.

Again, not fine dining here. But for fast, tasty, sit down Chinese cuisine - this is the place to come for a meal.

Tasty fare is guaranteed!

Also: on a recent visit I discovered... free wi-fi. :P"}
{"text":"Hopefully I get the food right this time compared to the last review I did for Yip Maple. :)

Anyway here's the run down of the food (thanks Jennifer K):

Shanghai Baked Special Whole Chicken (aka Beggar's Chicken) 
Special Deep Fried Duck   
Braised Shredded Eel   
Sweet and Sour Boneless Whole Yellow Fish 
 Dong Po Meat Lotus Leaf Wrapped 
A LA House Special Fried Rice Cake with Pork 
Crispy Deep Fried Banana with Honey   
Deep Fried Egg White Ball with Mashed Sesame

So here's the quick summary of it:

The Braised Shredded Eel with buns was the best dish for me.  Just because it was new-ish and I liked that it wasn't too chewy.  The buns (though lacking so I had to ration it) complement it.

The sugar coated bananas were also awesome, though honestly I still prefer the Philippine style turon.  It was very soft and tender inside but crunchy outside.  I would've liked more but there's just so few :D

The Shang-hai style Pig belly is quite okay as well.  Though it didn't come with buns (which I think they should have) I liked it with the the pork + rice patties.  I also liked it when I used the bun from the other dishes to help buffer the fat.  The fat wasn't too yucky oily so I enjoyed it. 

The rest were so-so / standard fare.

The Beggar's chicken I would say is unique and I was excited to try it out.  However, after eating it, I just found it tasted like the standard stewed chicken that I get at other Chinese places including home.  The only difference was it was fall off the bone and had some stuffing, but aside from that I don't think it would be worth the effort of pre-ordering. 

Sweet and sour fish was ok, nothing special

The deep fried duck was nothing really special as well.  It's just deep fried salted duck.  So you just taste salt and duck and not much else.

The worst dish, mind you at that point it was just gluttony having a second dessert, was the deep fried egg white with black sesame.  This one just went in wrong and after eating one I just felt it expand inside.  Usually means my body wants to reject it.  This was the only dish that had a left over.  After eating that I  need a flush of tea to get rid of the bloaty feeling.  However, as I said this was just being gluttony I didn't factor that in on my final star rating.

If price was not a factor then this would be between 3 to 4 stars.  However, considering how much we spent per person for the food we got, I don't think I got the value for what I spent and I was thinking it is between 2 to 3 stars just because of the price factor, but to be fair I think 3 would be the reasonable average.  However, I doubt this place would be something I'd remember to recommend to anyone, especially with Ding Tai Fung close by."}
{"text":"TLDR: craving for steamed/pan fried dumplings? Hot and sour soup? Green onion pancake? And you're around the area? Well, lets go! (A little bit pricey, but not too bad ;)) 

Will not disappoint! If you're looking for a place that stays mainly consistent, this is the place! I've been here three times throughout the year, and it's been a decent experience through all three. The service is also good, they seem happy to work there, even when it's busy! 

My friend and I came here on a Friday evening, it was pretty busy, but the wait isn't bad. We ordered, pan fried pork dumplings, green onion pancake, hot and sour noodle soup, and Singapore noodles! Yum yum yum! Nothing really big to complain about, but the skin of the pork dumpling did seem pretty thick, and the green onion pancake was a tad bit salty for my liking. It's also a bit more expensive than... the dumpling house. 

Overall? I would come back. :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant for family dinners!!! And it was surprisingly generous. Large dishes of food just kept coming, and we kept asking ourselves, \"Is this the last one?\"

I'm going to attempt to translate the 8-person combo we ordered:
- soup dumplings, of course
- a plate of assorted appetizers, Chinese style. So you have salty, tingy flavourful and bite-size food just to get everyone nibbling.
- spicy shrimps (hot-peppers-style spicy)
- broccoli and egg in the centre. The centre egg whites are mixed with fake crab or shrimp or whatever. It's simple but flavourful.
- roasted, crispy duck
- kung pao chicken. this was sooooooo amazing and spicy. I loooved it.
- fish, flavours depend on what they make that day
- stir-fry vegetables

That's actually a D- job of translation... A lot of these dishes are named. For example the broccoli and egg is called \"choi bon hai\" which means \"Veggies and crab.\" Every one of the dish above has a name. When you give this name to any Chinese chef, they know exactly what's in it and how to make it.

It's not like \"I want fries\" and every restaurant has its own style. You see \"Kung Pao Chicken\" has a specific recipe (with SOME chef variation). 

Anyways so everything was made well, I enjoyed all of them. I find their dishes are more \"raw\" so for example the broccoli actually tastes like broccoli. The dishes weren't cover with strong sauces or oil. Which I like.

Soup dumplings were decent, I think 3.5 stars out of 5. The dishes in the combo dinners are traditional, it's nothing unique. I guess I could say they are \"safe\" to order. 

All in all, I had a wonderful time here. Service was quick and staff was friendly. I would take my family and relatives back for more. Probably order the same things... they are not Yelpers after all."}
{"text":"Super crowded on the weekends and since the tables are so close together, it's like a maze trying to maneuver around, especially since my party was sitting in the side room.

I thought the food here was pretty average.  The xiaolong bao was good but a bit too chewy for my taste, great noodles, great rice cake noodles with wild green veggies making it slightly bitter and delicious crispy dumplings although the pork inside looked a bit raw.  

The star dish of A La is the gao li dou sha.  It's a bread with some sugar on top filled with egg and red bean.  It's slightly sweet but not overly sweet and it takes a really good baker for this dish to turn out right.  The bread was fluffy and not too hard so it was probably super fresh.  This is def not the type of food that preserves well in a doggie bag.  Come for the dessert!"}
