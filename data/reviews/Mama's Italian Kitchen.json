{"text":"Years ago when Sal owned it, before he added the mexican section, it was really good. After the Mex section was added, the food quality went down hill. It closed not long after, is now Phil's Filling Station."}
{"text":"I went here one night with my dad.  First of all, it's not just italian...it's also half mexican.  If you can't do one thing right, you certainly shouldn't try to do two things at once.  Absolutely dog food."}
{"text":"Mama's Italian Kitchen is two restaurants in one. One side is Italian and the other is Mexican. You can order off either menu the mexican side is where the bar is located with several tvs and they do make a mighty fine Marguirita. I have had both Mexican and Italian food and have never been disappointed. The owner, Sal is usually there and is always a great host. My favorite waitress Sooshe has a great personality and combine with the atmoshpere makes this my number one restaurant in Fountain Hills."}
