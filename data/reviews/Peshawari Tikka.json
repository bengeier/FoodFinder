{"text":"these guys have an awesome deal where you can get a seekh kabab roll for $3 CAD on Mon and Wed. The roll is AWESOME. Super soft naan. They also put their own orange sauce in it (mayo + sriracha?) which takes this roll to another level. very very good deal and a great place for a quick grab on the go."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I heard this new Pakistani restaurant opened up. The place itself is clean and there is space to sit. The chicken biryani was really good and full of flavor. You get a really good portion of biryani for just $6. The pakoras were also very good. Everything on the menu is affordable and the food is fresh. Service is great as well. I will definitely be returning for some more biryani and excited to try out other stuff on their menu."}

{"text":"Still waiting for order, it's been 40 minutes. With a family of 6. Just how long does it take to prepare the appetizers? 
Update: after 55mins I got my first samosa. As seen from the picture, no plates were served. After 1hr20mins the foods were served. They were kind enough to let us know that if the food was spicy, we could replace. However, this wait time is unacceptable given the fact that they didn't let us know if something was wrong with the kitchen. And it shouldn't be an excuse because there was only 2 tables. It doesn't take an hour to serve appetizers with only 2 tables in the restaurant!!!

The food was alright, a bit too oily to my liking (subjective). I always go to this other restaurant next door, with similar cuisine, which is much better than this one. 

When done eating, the lady comes back with a pen and pencil asking if we wanted more. You think we have all day? 

On a side note, while we were eating, this other table of 2 waited approximately 45 mins."}
