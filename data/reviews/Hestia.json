{"text":"The tea here is delicious! I got rose tea the first time, and a montreal fog latte the second time. The baristas were very friendly both times. Their teas do take some time to make though, so don't go if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"I'm pretty damn sure I've spent my last year of univeristy life at Hestia. This little tea cafe at Guy Concordia area is one of my favourites in downtown. While it's relatively small, it's also super cozy and quiet enough for me to get some work done. My favourite tea latte is their Montreal Fog, which is a hazelnut chocolate mate tea latte. I prefer having the tea brewed for an extra minute (just ask your barista to steep it longer!) for a stronger taste.   They have a royal card system so it's great for regulars who go there all the time! :)"}
{"text":"This place opened in the PVM tunnel a couple of weeks ago, so I stopped by to check out their tea selection. I picked out two oolongs and got a Moroccan Mint tea to go.  The Moroccan Mint was brewed nicely--not bitter, not too much mint. The barista (tea-rista? baris-tea?) offered me a little bit of sweetener, and lo and behold, it was not too sweet!   Overall, I was very pleased with the place. I often get my tea from David's Tea, but I feel sometimes like I have to play Artificial Sweetener Detective with even their most basic offerings, and some of their blends are strange.   Don't get me wrong, you can get all sorts of stuff on Hestia's menu if your tastes go to the more complicated end of the spectrum, but as you can tell, I am a bit of a tea grump and the more basic stuff they offer suits me just fine.  The dude who served me was nice and seemed knowledgeable about their offerings."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this little gem while running errands on my lunch break. I spotted the sign stating that they sold food from Aux Vivres which drew me in immediately. I was surprised to see so much selection in goodies and their tea. Food is tasty and affordable.  There is a points card system that you eventually get free drinks. I tried the Espresso Chai Latte made with almond milk and it was absolutely delicious (and surprisingly addictive).  The employees are friendly, informative, and efficient.  I am always going back for more."}
{"text":"Forget about Starbucks syrup flavoured drinks - this is where the real matcha latte is at. I'm a regular here not only for all the great options this place offers (vegan wraps and salads from Aux Vivres, vegan deserts, good tea, and matcha based drinks) but also because the staff is super friendly and welcoming.   Lucky for me, they now have a fidelity card that you can scan when you make a purchase. The salted caramel matcha latte is to die for"}
{"text":"I hesitant to try this tea spot, but I was pleasantly surprised. Obviously a lot of care has gone into this business. It's clean and the employees are friendly. The chai vanilla latte I tried did not have excess sweetness, which is great. I'm not a fan of too-sweet beverages.  They have a selection of croissants, bagels, and such as well. A cozy spot to enjoy a warm (or cold!) beverage."}
{"text":"I was fully ensconced in my morning grogginess a couple of days back when some purple person on the corner of Guy & De Maisonneuve pushed a \"Buck for a Coffee\" card into my hand. I tucked the card into my wallet deciding to keep the treat for next Friday morning when it would be most appreciated after a week of kitten herding.  Friday morning finally rolled around, as it has done for countless millennium. This particular one was cold, overcast, and had a touch of dampness that sent a shiver up my back. This morning was the perfect time to grab a cup of piping hot spendy joe to go!  The friendly counter staff welcomed me, and upon seeing that I had his promo card proceeded to explain that I could have any of the coffees on the menu for a dollar. Yay, and all that, but I like my coffee black; unadulterated; a symphony of dark bitterness. Kind of like a Guinness, yet appropriate for breakfast.  So that's what I ordered and, once my request was passed on to the barrista, a printed slip of paper was pushed across the counter, accompanied by the words \"You'll have to register in order to get your coffee\"  What?  No.  Sorry.   I don't give out my name, email address, and phone number to save pennies off the cost of a cup of coffee.  What could have been the discovery of a cozy café instead turned into something much less pleasant; a sneaky, underhanded marketing ploy.  So now I have a bitter taste in my mouth from the experience; I guess that's almost as good as a morning coffee, right?"}
{"text":"Tout nouveau salon de thé près de Guy-Concordia, le Hestia propose 21 variétés de thé en feuilles, et entre 6 à 8 mélanges signatures.  On retrouve également les mini-cupcakes de Petits Gâteaux, et les viennoiseries de Arhoma.   On y va pour faire des travaux, rédiger des articles (!) ou encore pour discuter entre amis.   Fait intéressant : Le programme de fidélisation fonctionne avec le numéro de téléphone, finie la carte perdue! On a ainsi droit à un café gratuit après chaque tranche de 10, même chose à son anniversaire."}
{"text":"What a great little tea shop!  Sophie was super nice and explained the menu to us in English even though she said her English wasn't very good (not true). I ordered a plain jasmine tea and my mom got the raspberry hibiscus. There were no other customers so we had the entire place to ourselves. I really enjoyed the decor with the natural wood, and the bathroom was bright and clean. As for the teas, the jasmine was great without sugar although some may think it too bitter. My mom said the raspberry hibiscus was a bit sweet but she enjoyed it nonetheless.   Free wifi and nice and cool inside :)"}
{"text":"I pass Hestia daily on my route from Place Ville Marie to Eaton Centre but had never tried it out until now. The place next door (Tunnel Espresso) always seems to draw in the crowds so because of that, I never gave Hestia a go.   From it's neat & tidy look, I always thought it was just a tea shop of some sort... How wrong I was!  Hestia has a variety of teas to offer as well as some unique coffee blends that are made to perfection. My absolute favourite, which I have not come across anywhere else, is the Chai Espresso Latte. Basically a combination of the rich blend of spices found in Chai tea (cinnamon, cardamom etc) combined with espresso and a touch of sweetness from the almond milk. I never thought you could combine the two but this concoction definitely works and is truly delicious!  I have yet to try the goodies they offer (food from Aux Vivres & various baked treats) so will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"It's a tea place and I still haven't tried any of their teas so I will make sure to post another review later BUT I can say that they sell food from Aux Vivres including lunches served with the famous Dragon sauce ... They also have (one of?) the best brownies in town: delivered by Arhoma. All this between Place Ville Marie and Eaton Center!"}
{"text":"Tasty teas and coffee/tea combos. I like that their flavours are relatively original and the ambiance is nice and relaxed. Good for studying!"}
{"text":"I only tried their drinks once, so I can't tell much about it. The selection is pretty good, and the caramel latte I tried was very aromatic.  What differentiate Hestia is the service and the friendliness. It is rare these days to find companies that will be so focused on welcoming their clients in a warm matter. They take the effort to explain to you right off the bat, instead of you asking for information. Even saying \"have a nice day\" at the end does a lot of difference.  Also, they handle promotions like experts. While waiting for my drink, they gently talk about their buy 10 get 1 free drink deal and their free drink on your birthday.  Also, it's a cozy place where you can sit down and study or have a talk with friends. It comes with free wi-fi too :)"}
{"text":"Their gingerbread chai tea latte is incredible. I seriously thought this was a chain it's so professional. To learn it's independent is very impressive.  Pros:  -Drinks are fantastic -Well-lit -Super clean and well-decorated -Music is great -Outlets are accessible from every seat -Free wi-fi -Near Guy-Concordia without feeling busy  Cons:  They don't serve sandwiches -- only desserts."}
{"text":"Really delicious iced tea. Flavors I've never tried before. Too bad they didn't serve coffee and we had to go next door"}
