This will be a weekly stop for me."}

{"text":"Cute new spot on Huron Rd. In DT Cleveland. 
Nice folks and wonderful Lebanese food!
Great beef shawarma and falafel sandwiches. Perfect lemony hummus as well. Portions are generous."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  We only had time for a quick bite to eat and found this gem. It's been open for 3 1/2 months and had a. Ice steady flow of customers while we were there. We tried the falafel pitas, chicken soup and babaganoush. All delicious. The homemade almond cookies were so yummy and their other baked goods looked great too. The owner was so welcoming. So glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"Zaytoon FTW ! Fresh made in house pita. I had the beef shawarma plater. I have tried many beef shawarmas in cleveland and surrounding cities and Zaytoon has the best marinade and beef around. The flavors were so dynamic yet inviting to all palates. The sauces were phenomenal from hot sauce to garlic sauce! My favorite was the fatoush salad and house dressing . Def recommend coming here and I will be back"}
{"text":"The food is sooo amazing!! David Ina is an awesome chef/owner. The Shwarma and Shish Tawok were full of flavor and fresh. The hummus was the best I've ever had. When you're in Cleveland you need to come here!!"}
{"text":"Zaytoon is fantastic, you have to go! The food is fresh and delicious. The owner and staff are friendly and accommodating.  They are sticking to traditional Lebanese fair and rocking it out of the park. Love it! I've had the beef schwarma, tabbouleh, hummus, pita and grape leaves with beef.  All excellent."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and delicious food at a good price point.  Clean restaurant and great service."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Baba Ganoush ! The pita tasted fresh, well, everything did. Everyone was super friendly too. Also, it looked very clean. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"So good and fresh! I love this place and the wonderful staff. The food has soul and is packed full of flavor. Be sure to try the home made hot sauce."}
{"text":"This is such a cute and cozy spot especially if you want a quick bite. I came in for breakfast and had the manoucheh (which is a thyme pie), the meat stuffed pie, and the fattouch salad. I have zero complaints! This seems like a nice small family owned shop and everyone was extremely friendly. 
They also have lattes and regular coffee, which I did not expect. 
Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Baba ghanouj took my wife back to Jordan. Lamb egg pita was phenomenal! Everything was extremely fresh. The sizzling sounds, colors, & aroma of everything made to order made us salivate before we even sat down with our food. If that was not enough, their great service made our day even brighter!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff, food is great and it's cheap! The coffee is a light roast( my favorite) and fresh"}
{"text":"This may be the Best middle eastern food in Cleveland, which is saying a lot because CLE has some amazing options for this style of food, from longtime favorite Nate's in Ohio City to Aladdin's Bakery to the variety of family owned favorites along Lorain Avenue in the West 120's. 

At Zaytoon, they seem to pay attention to the smallest of details and in addition they have a pretty killer hot breakfast menu with Rising Star coffee & espresso available.  For instance the fries are fresh cut gems - fluffy & crispy w/o being burnt. The labneh is pungent & spicy & will probably cure the common cold with the delectable thickness of Greek yogurt. The chicken kebab is juicy, flavorful, & seared to create a crisp outer layer. They offer a complementary home made hot sauce in small containers, ready to go, in the food pick up area. I also appreciate that they use real plates as I'm frustrated by our overly disposable culture. The window seating is also great to catch the surprising amount of action happening on Huron. 
Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great tasting Lebanese food with many vegetarian options. The staff are always very friendly as well. The dining area is very clean, but is mostly a a few small tables and a lunch counter. Because of the limited seating, it is not good for groups, so best is to order to-go."}
{"text":"Zaytoon never ceases to impress me. I ate here for the first time last week, have been back twice already. Just had a breakfast pita that was PHENOMENAL. Great atmosphere, excellent service and food, and well priced - I'd even argue they could charge more for how high quality the food is. I literally made a Yelp account just so I could give this place 5 stars. I'm very lucky to be just a three minute walk away!!"}
{"text":"Affordable, great tasting food with a friendly staff. Their roasted cauliflower shawarma was amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What a GREAT find!!!  

I always have loved Lebanese/Mediterranean style food.  Have enjoyed this cuisine world wide.

I made a visit to Zaytoon last week Wednesday while on a business trip in Cleveland.  Very urban cafeteria style.  VERY clean. People were enjoying their food.  Visually looked fresh and appealing.  Staff was very pleasant taking orders and also taking the time to explain foods for those not knowledgeable.  Customers' who frequent this restaurant were making recommendations to their guests, while I'm overhearing some of their comments.  \"Best Baclava ever\", \"The fattoush salad is amazing\", \"must try the Chicken Shawarma\".  I ordered the Fattoush salad and a Chicken Shawarma Pita.  I stood to the side and watched the line assemble all the customers food.  Very clean operation.  The owner, Dave (I didn't meet Dave until my second visit yesterday) oversaw the operation and assisted his staff.  My food was delivered timely.  It was received at a great temperature.  I started with the Shawarma Pita.  OUTSTANDING!!!! Fresh! Tasty!, Complex! A winner and one of the best I have ever had.  I believe this because everything is made in house. One sandwich filled me and the salad was going to have to hold until later in the day.  When I got to the salad much later it still was fresh.  The dressing (served on the side for Togo orders) was amazing.  One of the best Fattoush dressings I have enjoyed.  

So... I had another Cleveland business trip this week.  I actually couldn't wait to return to Zaytoon.  This visit, I brought a colleague who never had Lebanese food.  She LOVED it!!!  In fact, she talked all about it the entire flights back to Southern California.  But the best part is I got to meet Dave, the owner this trip.  I told him how much I enjoyed his restaurant.  Living in Southern California, I have many food choices but in my local I do not have the privilege to have Lebanese. I miss it!!! I stocked up!  Two Pita Shawarma, Fatoush Salad, Roasted Red Pepper Hummus and baklava.

This is a great place people don't miss out!!! Dave, please branch out to the Coachella Valley/Palm Springs, CA"}
{"text":"Oh my gracious we could not find this place even using two different GPS. There is construction going on across the street and the signage is not that great. I had to call to find out exactly where they are at. That said they are well worth finding. We had the beef schwarma so tasty with the pickled radish. Only seven and change. Ourdissappointmemt was a dish with chicken , Cole slaw and FRENCH FRIES. Sounds good right? and when the gal described it I said, \"that's for me\". Well she failed to explain it was all wrapped in a flat bread?? Ewww.  Weird and not tasty. The tasty schwarma made up for it. Recommend that for sure."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for fresh, healthy food! All made to order with quick turn around service. Space is cozy but very modern with ample seating along the windows and a few tables in the back. Definitely will be back for me and may be my new go-to lunch spot. Reminds me of my Aunts cooking!"}
{"text":"I visited Zaytoon for the first time before heading to Playhouse Square for a show. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and delicious! I'm a big fan of Al's Deli so I didn't expect anything less from Zaytoon."}
{"text":"We love to stop in for a quick bite before our shows at Playhouse Square. Chef David doesn't disappoint! Lamb Manousheh is fabulous! Hot, crisp, and full of flavor!  Got a Falafel to go for intermission! Can't wait to eat it!"}
{"text":"I visited Cleveland for 5 days, and my last day I just HAD to find some delicious VEGAN food. Zaytoon's was absolutely just what I needed!  I had the roasted cauliflower shawarma plate and some pita. It was amazing and fresh.  The lemon tahini sauce was a great addition, as were the pickled veg! I'm back in Indiana today, but this meal stands out as one of the most comforting and spiritually nourishing meals I had in Cleveland. The service was fast and very friendly too. It was a little off the beaten path, but well worth the effort!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a quick bite! You can get something healthy or not so healthy for cheap. The desert (get the namura) and coffee is fantastic. They don't have spaghetti."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today! Great addition to downtown. Small, more of a take out place but a few tables and window side bar to eat in. Friendly staff, service was great-a bit of a wait but it was lunch time and the food was made fresh. I had the vegetarian grape leaves which came with a lemon wedge, yogurt sauce for dipping and sizable thin pita - which I loved because I don't like getting a loaf of bread with a light lunch. Nice flavor and tang even without adding the lemon! Will definitely be back to try other items - especially breakfast! Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"So happy this awesome little place opened up right near me! Tried some grab and go food here. You can customize a platter for yourself that comes with a meat, rice, pickled turnips (yum) and two sides. I tried the chicken shwarma plate with fries and quinoa salad. The fries were insanely delicious. They come hot and crispy, and include some herb seasoning that you can sprinkle on as liberally as you like (I think it had sesame seeds and oregano?). Actually, everything I tried as delicious and the portions were definitely satisfying. 
I took my food to go but hey have small window seats where you can enjoy your meal. 
Only downside is that it's only open 7-3 on the weekdays and 7-2 on Sat for the working crowd. Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Always quick, delicious, and reasonable! Best staff and very clean restaurant. I'd eat here every day if I could. The pitas and salads are awesome. The fries are off-the-hook."}
{"text":"I've been eating here at least once and sometimes twice a week since I've realized they opened. Absolutely delicious. Miiiiiight be my favorite hummus in town. Hard to say because there is a ton of good hummus around... but theirs has a slight lemon taste to it that give it this extra brightness that is irresistible. My go-tos are the Chicken Shawarma pita sandwich or the Falafel platter which comes with brown rice and your choice of 2 sides - I go with the hummus & fattoush salad (the house salad dressing is wonderful!). Great service and fast. Perfect for popping in on my lunch break. Food so good, it actually makes me emotionally happy while eating it.

Tips: 
-- The garlic sauce is fantastic, but very powerful. I try to remember to order it on the side when ordering the Chicken Shawarma Pita. 
-- It's a tiny restaurant so wouldn't be ideal for a group but would highly recommend for flying solo or with a friend. 
-- They do call-ahead orders and take out."}
{"text":"Pros:
-Amazing fast casual Lebanese food. It took me awhile to get here, but when I finally did, I was not disappointed. The rolled pitas are the perfect meal when you are looking for something that is fresh and not too heavy. We've had this for a quick Saturday lunch and also a pre-Playhouse Square show. Both were the perfect amount of food and didn't make us feel disgustingly greasy or full afterwards.
-Meticulous menu. Some may disagree, but I think the menu is just the right amount of choices and the perfect array of options. It's not overwhelming but there are options for all types of diets and food allergies (yes, gluten-free!).
-Value. Almost every entree is $10 or under. What. A. Deal.
-Bonus hours! They recently added the dinner hour (on limited days) to their operation times. We could never get there for lunch so I was so excited for the new hours!

Cons:
-Good for a few people, but not a large group (unless you are catering). Their indoor space is a bit narrow so I would say to avoid a group larger than 4. However, if it's nice outside, you can always grab and go to the plaza outside of Playhouse Square. Or cater for a big group!

Bottom Line:
I am cray-zay for Zaytoon!!!"}
{"text":"Went here two days in a row and seriously considered ordering one of everything because I brought 5 people with me the second day. Everyone was happy with the bakery items such as the Zaatar Manousheh, as well as the individual plates we ordered of various pita wraps and Shawarma plates. We got the fresh made lemonade and strawberry lemonade that my 6 year old absolutely loved! Before we left we ordered cappuccinos and a LARGE to-go order for friends that couldn't come with us. Going on Friday for breakfast! Lunch menu can accommodate for Vegetarians, Vegans and children. So very sad we are going back home to New Orleans, can't wait to return!

Forgot to mention that the Beef Shawarma options are delicious, well seasoned RIBEYE!"}
{"text":"Yummy ethnic addition to downtown cleveland. They are open for breakfast and lunch and specialize in lebanese fare (think shwarmas, falafel) with a more diverse menu than expected including fresh baked treats. On opening day, they gave free samples of a numura cake which was deliciously moist and soaked in orange syrup.

I ordered the beef shwarma plate ($11) which comes with two sides. I got the lentil salad and fouttoush salad. The beef was tender and flavorful with a generous coating of middle eastern spices. The salads were also tasty despite being salads. The fouttoush salad was unique and they added crunchy crouton-like crackers on top which added a nice textural dimension.

Good food, friendly service. Will be back and most excited to get some namura cake!"}
{"text":"Delicious Lebanese food. Got the shawarma mixed plate with baba ghanouj and shish tawook all of which was really good. Very friendly people and fast service. If I lived in Cleveland I'd definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing! Very authentic! The staff is super friendly. I will walk the extra distance just to go there. I even buy food to bring home with me so I can enjoy takeout throughout the week. I have tried the salads, wraps, and platters and love it all!"}
{"text":"I really can't put into words how much I love the zataar manousheh. This was a revelation. I've long been a fan of Lebanese food, but this delight was new to me when Zaytoon came along. Don't get me wrong, the rest of their menu rocks, too, but I have a definite soft spot for the flatbread. My other favorites include the spinach pie and vegetarian grape leaves. I have a hard time not ordering one of everything when I go. This is a very welcome addition to downtown."}
{"text":"Good options for Mediterranean food. They are very fast and decently prized. Dining in can be difficult as they don't have much seating capacity."}
{"text":"I really don't think I can rave enough about this place! I work in the area, so I've been in several times since they opened, and I've never been disappointed! 
The standout item, to me, is the cauliflower shawarma rolled pita. I've never had anything like it, and it is maybe the BEST vegetarian (vegan?) sandwich I've ever had. It's roasted seasoned cauliflower with hummus, spinach, pickled eggplant, and a cilantro chutney on their thin, chewy pita that makes for a creamy, tangy, flavorful sandwich that is just... you gotta try it! 
Also good- the zaatar manousheh has killer flavor, the spinach feta pies are light and an affordable add-on to any other main dish, and the zaatar fries are great!
The restaurant itself is lovely- it's small but they've done a nice job making the space feel fresh, airy, and modern with beautiful arrangements of fresh flowers to top it off. My only complaint is that I wish there were more seating. There are 2 small tables and a bar with some stools (maybe a dozen) facing out the window. I basically never count on finding a place to sit in there, and just do takeout. 
Please add Zaytoon to your regular rotation! I don't want to lose them!"}
{"text":"So glad that this place opened downtown in the heart of Cleveland. It's fresh, vibrant, and beyond flavorful. The food is prepared in house with care. His ingredients are top tier and everything is colorful and full of life. I've visited a wide array of classic Lebanese/Mediterranean joints all over the country. I actually try to seek out places that serve this style of pita. Much to my surprise, not only is the chef serving the classic style but he's making it in house fresh daily. The flavor of each plate along with sides was bold, and could stand alone on their own! However, served together it's quite the experience. This guy gets it and his menu is dialed in perfectly. I respect craft kitchens. For the time there you don't feel like you're downtown Cleveland. That's exactly what you want when you walk through the door of a place like that. I'll be back and telling all my friends about it! Pro tip: Don't skip the dessert or coffee on the way out!!!"}
{"text":"Go good for a little dinner spot. Casual atmosphere with delicious well made Lebanese favorites. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Well I'm clearly in the minority. At the moment there are 29 reviews: 28, 5-star and 1, 4-star. Then mine. 2-star. I can't go higher though because I have experienced better, pretty much everywhere else. Thinking off the cuff there are 5 comparable Lebanese restaurants in the nearby area. I think the food I had here ranked 6th on that list. 

I ordered the Shish Tawook entree for lunch. I was served a nice portion of two skewers of chicken with garlic sauce and..... coleslaw  and.....french fries. 

The sides were disappointing. While the coleslaw was good, at a Lebanese restaurant that really isn't what I want and I certainly don't want fries. How about something like rice and a small salad? That aside, the chicken also disappointed. I'm not sure if it was dark meat or what, but the taste, texture and quality of the chicken disappointed so much I didn't even finish an entire skewer of it. 

Also, can we have real silverware please? There are real plates for dine-in customers, so silverware would be an easy touch. 

Despite a nice atmosphere and friendly staff I won't be back. There are plenty of other options of Lebanese food - several in walking distance of here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite goto spots.  The Roasted Jalapeno Hummus is unbelievable along with any of the soups or the chicken schwarma.  The staff is also great no complaints from me."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! The food is authentic and the staff is so friendly!  Such a hidden gem"}
{"text":"This food was delicious!. The place is a little small, but has a very nice look to it. I ordered the chicken shawarma entree, but subbed chicken skewers. The chicken was moist and delicious. As was the rice, tabbouleh and baba ganoush. I also got one of the seasoned flat breads, Zaatar Manousheh, which was really tasty. The prices were good too, so all around, I highly recommend. I will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"So lucky to have this so close to work. Been several times and have tried different things each visit without any disappointments. Prompt service and friendly staff."}
