{"text":"Not bad if you want a quick, cheap filling meal.

I shared one order with my mom and we were both satisfied after finishing it.

The food here is pretty oily, but it is understandable as they need to stir fry it, it also complements the heaping pile of white rice you get with your dish. The quality is sometimes a bit off though, sometimes the veggies are slightly past prime freshness, but it's still good. 

You usually also get soya milk with your meal. Yumm."}
{"text":"Fast food place is about speed and taste. This is a pretty good place for Chinese food. I ordered a curry beef brisket on rice. Little pricey then regular food court. But the beef is very tender and they gave you a full bowl of it and the rice is on a separate bowl."}
{"text":"The ladies at the counter are super friendly and provide awesome customer service!!!  (Hugs to them)

The food is quick and prepared with love.  I still have items I want to try, but so far everything has been very tasty. 

Recommend: Rice noodles with beef"}
{"text":"Foodcourt stall selling Chinese food in Pacific Mall.  I ordered beef ho fan (flat noodles) in black bean sauce for around $7.  In no time at all, my food was cooked and given to me.  Some people stir fried the noodles, but they boiled it here, and then put the stir fried beef and vegetables with lots of sauce on top.  After mixing everything up, i found this entr√©e to be delicious.  And the quantity was pretty decent as well.  On top of that, we were given a complimentary cup of soy milk, which was awesome!"}
