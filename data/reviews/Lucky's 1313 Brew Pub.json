{"text":"We recently had the ceremony, dinner and reception for my daughters wedding at Lucky's 1313 in their new venue space.  JJ and Angela were extremely focused and dedicated in ensuring the vision we had for the wedding went smoothly which it did!!  Their customer service and attention to detail was impeccable.  They provided ample servers, bartenders in addition to overseeing the food (appetizers/plated dinner/late night food) which was all delicious!  They also managed the staff when the venue space needed to be converted from ceremony to reception to dance floor/DJ area.  Not an easy feat but they put that together seamlessly.  Very accomodating and hard working staff during the day, especially JJ, Page, and Zac but all the staff was very pleasant!  Lots of details to putting the wedding together with a party of 140 people and the staff at Lucky's did an amazing job making everything go smooth and memorable!  Great venue space and service!!  Highly recommend for wedding venue!"}
{"text":"This place... College bar? Yes. Cool atmosphere? From what I could tell until the bouncer told me and my husband to get out because we carried in Greenbush donuts (our treat for morning breakfast) to take home. Way to support local businesses!!"}
{"text":"Lucky's needs work. Nice place if you want the wrong drinks. Cold and small portions of fish on Friday. The hockey bus ran late got to game 9 mins late. Better go to the Big 10."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome atmosphere for game days, yet at the same time is a nice enough place to take your family on a regular weekday. Love what they've done with the space and how they were able to maintain the original character and auto shop vibe- especially the garage doors. Menu has great variety, and the food is way more than your average greasy bar food. Was very skeptical about the Italian nachos, but they totally work! The best part about this place is probably the service - some of the friendliest, most fun bartenders and wait staff you'll find in Madison. Was sad to see the old Regent Street Lucky's go, but 1313 has exceeded expectations!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice with my coworkers. The first time was with their limited menu and then again with their full menu.  On both visits we had horrendous service. The first time the server was just plain rude, the second time the server didn't seem to know the menu very well and was very, very, very slow.  Also, our first visit was on a cool, fall day and they decided to open the garage doors in the front and back - which made the indoor temperature too cool to remain comfortable while just sitting down to eat lunch.  Both times the food was just edible. None of us are planning to return."}
{"text":"The bar has a great atmosphere and they make a good Bloody Mary!  The food, however, leaves much to be desired. My husbands burger was average, ok. I ordered the chicken Caesar salad. It was NOT a Caesar salad. I should have anticipated problems when I was asked for my dressing choice. I said....Caesar. The waiter told me they didn't have Caesar!! Then how is it a Caesar salad! So, I got Italian. It was, hands down, one of the worst salads I've ever had (including fat food). The chicken was cold and tasted like it was cooked days before. The Parmesan was nearly impossible to notice - maybe 4 small shavings.  To top it off, our service was horrible and unbelievably slow. I recommend that they either fix their menu or take salads off completely! Would I return? For drinks on a game day - yes. For food - no."}
{"text":"I've been a semi regular here for Wednesday night Trivia (If you get the chance to play, it's a blast). They have daily deals for both food and drink.  Food: On the whole it's pretty average bar food, but they have some interesting dishes. The pretzel and nacho appetizers are HUGE and pretty tasty. I really love pretzel buns and Lucky's are great. Their tater tots have a little crunch to them.   Ambiance: I've never been when it's crazy busy, but there are a ton of tables so you don't need to worry about getting seated. There's a big bar you can sit around too and I know there are regulars that practically call this place home.  Service: Honestly a little confusing. Sometimes when we come a waitress will serve us and sometimes they just don't walk up to our table so we will go order from the bar. In general very helpful. They've forgotten the peanut butter on the sticky burger and to switch the bun to a pretzel bun."}
{"text":"Decent, high quality, bar food.  Table of nine with varied menu items and all were first time visitors.  All of us were impressed quality and value."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times over the past 6 or so months. They have their own beers, and i enjoy the red ale the most. I have never been disappointed in my meals here, and the burgers are always a good bet. The nacho plates are good and can be ginormous! The western/cowboy burger is good too.   The place is a converted oil change/car service place, so on nice summer days the overhead garage doors can open for a pretty cool ambiance."}
{"text":"I had never been to a meal at the new luckys before BUT Zach was our waiter and he was phenomenal. We got samples of beer that we had inquired about and the service was so fast. He was great and I would come back!"}
{"text":"Stopped with my UW student daughter today for lunch.  Garage door was open and a beautiful afternoon to have lunch in the open-air.  The setting is really cool and the service today was good, except trying to find our waitress to pay and leave took longer than one would like.    I got the smothered chicken sandwich on a pretzel roll and daughter got the Caesar chicken wrap.  The grilled smothered chicken was very good, the wrap was just ok.    I'll definitely come back for the smothered chicken, and with that have hopeful outlook for the remainder of the menu."}
{"text":"50 cent wings are usually not that good if you know what I mean. Not here. Wings were great. Nice and meaty with a good buffalo sauce."}
{"text":"I love the large area l, tall ceiling and mega space. Someone made a good point regarding their curiosity of winter weather and how it will hold up.  Only thing i had was the Mango habanero wings not as hot as i would think, or want, but... other menu items look great and offer vegetarian options, which i really appreciate, even though i am not a true vegetarian.  Friendly service, love the garage door effect, which i just heard is increasing in popularity in MKE......can't say a ton more, as i went one of the first week or so they were open and it was early afternoon, 2ishpm.  Def would be interested to go for a home and away game day!"}
{"text":"Decided to watch some football there today, arriving around halftime for the Packer's game.  The space is very inviting, with the open garage doors and high, industrial looking ceilings.  Today was a beautiful day to have everything open.  I was by myself and found a single seat at the bar.  Service at the bar was great.  Selection of tap beer was okay....maybe even good, but I have seen better.  I don't like Leiny's Octoberfest and that is the only Octoberfest they had on tap, so I went to the tried and true Spotted.  The place has plenty of TVs.  I was happy that they had a couple on other games, but glad the main TVs and the sound was on the Packers.  I decided to try the food and based on a recommendation from the bartender I ordered wings with a Jamaican Jerk dry rub; these were the absolute best wings I have had in a long time (much to my surprise).  Seriously....they were flavorful, large enough (I don't like really big ones) and crisp.  I wanted more but I needed to hold off.  I am going back this week to try one of the wet sauce to see if they are just as good.  Highly recommended.  Why not a five star.....I need to go a few more times and maybe i will upgrade.  I say try it some evening or some non Badger game day."}
{"text":"Unless you want E. coli, I suggest you stay far away! While eating, I watched one of their kitchen staff walk out of the bathroom with an apron on and walk back into the kitchen! I was so close to reporting them! That is disgusting and I will never eat here again or advise anyone to.   On the other hand, the staff was very friendly and the food was great."}
{"text":"I typically avoid writing a review for an atypical situation but after last night, I feel I need to.  As with other weekends when a state tournament is in town (football, wrestling, etc), many restaurants (on Regent St. in particular) simplify and condense their menu to handle the onslaught of people that visit. I get it, to handle the slam of people, this is a necessity.  It is a perfect storm of St. Pattys weekend, NCAA basketball and state basketball so I was expecting this when I stopped in to meet up with a friend.  My first disappointment came when our server brought our beer back in small plastic cups.  Really?  At least get plastic pint glasses-you are a restaurant not a basement at a frat house.  The bigger disappointment came when I ordered a cheeseburger ($8) and tater tots ($3) as a side.  I barely blinked and the food was already at our table-not a good sign as it indicates they were preassembled ahead of time.  The patty tasted that is was made with a mixture of beef and filler as it had a mushy feel to it.  Cheese barely melted.  The tater tots were luke warm.  For $11, I was served a meal that was worse than what I would have received at a fast food restaurant.  And this is what compels me to write this.  I feel Lucky's approaches these situations as a money grab vs. an opportunity to win customers or at very least, have pride in delivering a good experience.  They assume that most customers are from out of town and that delivering poor food and service is acceptable as they won't be back anyways.  The problem is that there are some, like myself, live in the neighborhood or are local to Madison.  Based off my experience last night between the food, beverages and the shoddy service, I don't see myself every coming back.  There are too many other places (like across the street or right down the block) that actually care about what they put in front of the customer."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. They have a cool atmosphere and the fact that they turned an old car shop into a bar is nice because they open the garage doors on nice days. The food is good, I've had a few of their burgers and recently ordered wings-their buffalo wings are amazing!! They host have fun events to keep you coming back for more too. The service is a little slow at times but they are always very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times -- a couple times with their limited menu and then once again with their full menu. The first couple of times, I didn't not like it, but I didn't necessarily care for it either. We decided to give it a try again, and now I probably won't ever be back. Sure it's a great location for Game day and all, I love the open concept, but the service was pretty terrible. We seated ourselves, and waited, and waited. There were at least five different servers walking around, chatting with each other, one guy even looked directly at us, stared for a couple seconds, and then walked away. After about four or five minutes a server finally approached us with menus, and we ordered our food. Honestly the wait for our server feels like it was longer than the wait for our food- which is questionable as well. Food is pretty average, it isn't memorable or spectacular -- we had one of their chicken sandwiches and their Cuban sandwich. I'm not impressed with their food or service. I'll take my business elsewhere like across the street."}
{"text":"Great location using an old building.  I'm looking forward to see them grow."}
{"text":"I like the casual feel of this place. The feel of the place gets a 4. The food gets about a 3. I have been wanting to check out this place for a while and was super excited when others chose this place for dinner. We were told to check out their $9 Bavarian pretzel (on app menu). IT IS GINORMOUS!  It is best as an app for 3-5 people. It comes with a cheese sauce and mustard sauce. Both are good options. After the pretzel, I opted to share a Cubana sandwich. It was ok. I've had better Cubanas elsewhere. The bread was soggy and the filling was pretty flavorless. Another at my table ordered a burger. It came out over done and kind of dry. For me, typical bar food. I will definitely try this place out during game day. I have a feeling that it gets quite busy and would be a fun place to watch a Badger game with friends."}
{"text":"My partner and I stopped in for Fish Fry Friday around 5 pm. We chose to sat at the bar, and took our seat. Nearly ten minutes went by before the guy behind the bar bothered to ask us if we wanted something to drink. There was another girl working behind the bar, but she seemed pretty busy herself, so you'd think this guy (who appeared to be of manager status- I could be wrong) would pay closer attention to the people sitting at the bar.  He eventually brought us our drinks, and then began to walk away. We had to grab his attention before he left, though, to let him know we also wanted to order food. After receiving our menus, another 10 minutes or more want by. We finally flagged the guy down to let him know we were ready to order. I decided I wanted to take the \"add fried shrimp for $4\" deal - but when I told him that, he looked like he had no idea what I was talking about. The man then walked away toward a register kiosk, punched a few things in, and then let us know he had to check to see if they still had the shrimp deal. He then began talking and joking with his co-workers, and neglected to send our order through or check if we could actually get said shrimp.   After a while, he came back to let us know that they did have the shrimp and that he put our oder in. At this point, we've been at the restaurant a good 45 minutes. We began to wait for our food (and were never offered another beer or water refill)...  The fish was great, the shrimp though, was so overcooked that it was the texture of rock candy. In addition to this already poor experience, the place remained crowded due to unmotivated bartenders and employees - so trying to eat at the bar was miserable, with other patrons basically sitting in my lap.   They ended up comping the shrimp, so that's cool - I guess. But you could tell they just didn't care about being at work, and were more interested in chumming around with co-workers and ignoring patrons.   Needless to say, we won't be back for food - drinks, or otherwise."}
{"text":"Great drink specials! Great atmosphere! Love the look of the old car shop. The bartender was trying to get rid of cucumber vodka, so she was trying pretty bad drinks on us, but that was ok we welcomed it. Food was better than bar food. The 3 stars is due to the closing of our tab. One friend left early so she paid in advance. When we tried to leave (splitting the remainder in two) it was literally many conversations amongst two young bartenders  who just could not comprehend our tab. They didn't seem apologetic, more that it was our fault that our friend left early. Not a good end note for this bar  won't be back until two collage aged girls can divide by 2."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place with a great staff and a solid selection of beer.   My wife and I wandered in here looking to try some beer. The bartender set us up both with $10 flights so we could sample their wares. My wife and I both have different tastes in beer (she prefers IPAs and I stouts), but we both found something to enjoy. We actually both agreed on the Raspberry Porter and can highly recommend it. For a nightcap, she had an Old Fashioned (Wisconsin style with bourbon and brandy) and I had bourbon, neat. Both a good deal as the Old Fashioned was on special for $5 and the bourbon was a solid pour for a fair price.   The staff was great! The bartenders gave us great service and interesting conversation. One of the owners was sitting near us, and he also joined in the conversation. The staff also took care of us by turning on one of the TVs to the Braves game, as we are huge fans.   Overall, a great bar!"}
{"text":"Haha wow. Got the Black and Bleu Portabella Sandwich (without Garlic Aioli). It was awesome. They even do the thing where the bun is glossy and just way better than usual. The bites without portabella, with just the bun, lettuce, tomato, etc. were even good. I think I ordered fries on the side but they gave me tater tots. Don't usually get them but they were good, crispy, etc. There was actually a single french fry in there and the tater tots held their own comparatively. The place was nice inside but I got carry out. Another nice thing was the side of bbq sauce in a little cup sized container, so there was more than enough."}
{"text":"The food at this place is terrible.  Got a flatbread pizza, the crust was soggy and ingredients were cheap - reminded me of an elementary school cafeteria pizza.  My wife got a burger and fries - initially they brought out her order with the wrong cheese and cooked onions instead of raw.  To remedy, they scraped off the wrong cheese and served it to her again, with some of the original wrong cheese still melted to the patty.  Fries were also soggy and undercooked.  Also blasted weird children's and holiday music during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"I've only been on game day.  And it's exactly what I'd expect on game day.  Loud, crowded, and spirited, in a good way.  Drinks are pretty easy to get, but unless it's a beer it's size will disappoint you.  Bathrooms are available but not easily found.  There are a few tables and chairs lurking around if you're LUCKY enough to snag one (see what I did there?!).  Lots of windows and garage doors make for some good people watching when the game isn't on.  Fun atmosphere, easy to hang out there.  It's a good use of the space and I suspect if they keep up the good vibes it will be super popular!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this new place for drinks and appetizers after work. Only wine is single bottles of barefoot. Tap list is decent. Music is pleasant but not creative. Space is inviting especially with open garage doors this time of year. Bartenders efficient and attentive. The Italian nachos were yummy, but not very healthy. :). Killed a lot of flies with my bare hands while eating at bar. Staff never noticed."}
{"text":"Their wrap or salad option is an awesome way to eat healthy on game days without looking snooty! If you're going the semi-healthy route, do not miss out on the Kickin' Chicken wrap or the Going to Cauli wrap. Tater tots over fries all day, and their ranch and buffalo sauce are awesome side kicks! (Garlic Parmesan? Not so much). Pro-Tip: upgrade your side to cheese curds. This is a universal rule."}
{"text":"I've been to this Lucky's location a couple of times now and it is a big upgrade from their former location. The bar is huge, there is plenty of seating, there is outdoor seating, and they have large garage doors that open up for the summer in the front and back of the bar. The waiters were friendly and quick. One thing I like about this bar is the large number of TV screens and they also have dart boards! They just came out with their own beers recently in March, I tried the red ale and the Special Badger, I have to say that I was not overly impressed, they had a flat taste to them and reminded me of bud light. Overall, I love the new Lucky's and I will continue to frequent this bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"Great use of the space and keeping the feel of the rustic shop that once occupied the space...love that!  Drinks are good and I haven't tried the food so I can't comment; however, I'm very disappointed that most of the TV's are not in HD.  Really Rod!?  It's 2016, there is no excuse other than you are too cheap to pay for it.  I pay full price for my drinks when I patronize your establishment please do the same for your HD subscription.  Right now Sconnie's is winning with better tv viewing (all HD) and great food!"}
