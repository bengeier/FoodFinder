{"text":"My partner and I tried Bolan a few weeks ago and really enjoyed the food. 

We split the fresh rolls to start and they were really good. Tasty and all the ingredients felt crisp with a clean flavour. 
I got the Bolan pad thai and it was delicious! I absolutely adored all the flavours. My partner had one of the curries and he said it was really great as well. 

The only complaint I have is I ordered a beer with our drinks which never came. I definitely could have asked again, but truthfully I took it as a sign that I didn't need one, ha! 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"My gf and I ordered from Bolan based on the gorgeous pics, rave reviews and the menu selection. 

First off, they got our order wrong. They delivered us a lemongrass soup instead of the rice dish we ordered. But hey, mistakes happen. Really not a big deal.

Secondly, the pad thai and khao soi we ordered were bland and flavourless. But still, not a big deal. 

What IS a big deal is when my gf has an allergic reaction to the food despite the restaurant assuring us that none of the dishes would come into contact with any peanuts or peanut by-products. That is utter BS! 

It's bad enough eating mediocre thai food, let alone eating it while determining whether your partner needs to be rushed to hospital. Good news: she's ok. Bad news: our search continues for good local Thai food that both delivers AND won't kill my gf."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday lunch just because we were in the area. They were open just a few minutes after the posted yelp time, but no big deal- maybe just 5 past! 

Many people came in for take out, and the servers were polite. 
Prices are reasonable, and the restaurant is fairly clean! 

I had the Khao soi gai (and without chicken) and my husband had the pad Thai (without peanuts), they were flexible to omit our allergies. I asked if I could have beef instead of the chicken and it was an extra $2.50! I opted for the vegetable option instead- probably better for my health anyway! 

All in all, it was a good experience. Both meals were so filling and plated nicely! So yummy! 
Would come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town. I am a big fan of Thai food and Haven been eating it for 10+ years.  This is one of all the excellent places  I have dined in my life and I haven't eaten all across north America. It is smaller, cozy, nice ambience with tasty food. It was served tastefully in nice plates and dish presentation

The service is also friendly. More mom and pop but also professional which make me like it even more."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and intimate and the staff are really friendly - always a bonus to order Thai food in my native language. It's such a great addition to the neighbourhood. The food is authentic and super yummy. I ordered a delivery tonight and the food still looks and tastes perfect. Great place, couldn't recommend more."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, fresh, healthy, and well-priced!! The space is very well decorated, it feels modern and authentic. The staff is friendly and service is quick.

I went for lunch and had their fresh rolls and their Buddha delight stir-fry. Both items were absolutely delicious. The rolls were packed of quality ingredients (i.e. not like those stuffed with noodles and bean sprouts) and very very very flavourful! The stir-fry was perfect: Not greasy, fresh, well presented, tasted very homemade (i.e. not craze sauces from a bottle)

Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Our search for some great Thai food led us to this gem! We ordered the Bolan Pad Thai and the Green Curry, both were very tasty. The Pad Thai was unique from the usual ones we get from other Thai restaurants because of the egg crepe. Would visit again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"What a great little spot and a gem of a find in my neighborhood. I had the Bolan Pad Thai. So delicious! A twist on the classic. Glass noodles, shrimp and an egg crepe really set this dish apart from your standard Pad Thai. Plus, I got a free dessert just for checking in on Yelp. I will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible nook. The green curry, and the two mango desserts (mango sticky rice and mango mousse) are all incredible. 

This will be the only Thai restaurant I'll go to when I crave it, since I live nearby."}
{"text":"This is the worst Thai food I've ever had. The pad thai was too sweet, and the green curry was watery and lacked flavour. The fried tofu appetizer was bland and tasteless.  Very disappointed considering the great ratings."}
{"text":"We were curious about this new place and went in for lunch. The d√©cor is really relevant and charming, comprised of cool and interesting Thai foodstuffs and products: A comfy place to eat in with nice ambience. The service was polite and quick. We ordered the pad se-ew and pad Thai. The dish presentation was better than most other places in the 'hood; creative and well thought out but not overly funky or over the top. The pad Thai comes inside a thin egg crepe with the sprouts on the side; You can mix everything up (like I did), or put every bite together with your perfect amount of egg and veg. The food was absolutely awesome. Really great flavours and not oily which I really liked. The only knock for us was that we felt the portion size was small for the price, especially so for the pad se-ew. You'll be fine if you order an app with dinner, but if you are quite hungry and ordered what we did (for 2 people) and want to be good and full, you may be left a little hungry. Of course this knock is subjective, but if you are a fan of the portion size at a place like The Queen Mother with their noodle dishes, you may be disappointed. Quality over quantity isn't a huge minus here though, because the food is just so darn good.

Overall, I highly recommend it. I think it may be the best Thai food I've had in Toronto. 

The quality of the food is outstandingly and refreshingly superb. Personally I'm going to order the more affordable lunch special to offset portion size woes, but I'll certainly be going back. Again, portion size is subjective and I happen to be a large human being.

Edit: Went for the pad Thai lunch special and was again blown away by the quality, and the portion size was good."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I have had since spending time in Chiang Mai. The pad thai was exactly as I remember it from Chiang Mai markets, the green curry was perfectly spicy,  and the cashew chicken was to die for. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"amazing thai food!! green curry was unreal. service was quick and friendly and food presentation was also quite nice."}
{"text":"Summary:
New Thai spot in the Mount Pleasant/Eg area. 
4 stars for food. 
Lunch special is good value. 
Wish their take out containers were plastic instead of styrofoam. 

Food:
I decided to try their lunch special and ended up getting the chicken pad thai. It was delicious - noodles weren't drenched in sauce, still chewy and the flavour was well balanced (salty, sweet, sour). 

I was told that the lunch portions are smaller than their dinner portions but it was plenty of food for me and I'm a big eater. Also, came with a side, which I chose the thai pumpkin soup, which was essentially similar to a butternut squash soup consistency/flavour, finished with a bit of coconut milk. 

Rating:
I give this joint a 4 stars but need to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Very happy to have such an authentic Thai restaurant in the neighbourhood.  The food was delicious and the presentation was amazing - like a nice dinner out in Bangkok.  The staff was great too -  definitely kid friendly.  I hope it does well in this location!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and authentic thai food! The best in the area with nice presentation of food. I've been eating here since they opened and the food is consistently good with a fair priced lunch menu."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Thai food! They're one of the places that is authorized by Thai embassy as the authentic thai restaurant.  We had vegetarian roll, bolan special pad thai, khao soi and many more. Deserts are also a must try especially the ice cream tapioca. As always I ordered thai ice tea, my husband had the thai coffee which is different from the coffee you buy from any chain coffee shops. It tastes very refreshing yet not too light. They also offer a variety of thai cuisine products including the thai iced tea leaves powder and bottled thai coffee. I now regret that I didn't purchase any. We will definitely revisit this place and highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect at first as the restaurant was a bit empty. Took a chance and went in anyways and thank goodness I did. This restaurant is quaint with some decor (not tacky). The food was great. The presentation was great. Started with the spring rolls and they were served at just right temperature, entree was pad Thai which tasted fabulous! To end the meal it was the best mango dessert I've had!! A definite must try if you are in the Yonge and Eglinton area looking for delicious Thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"A taste of the exotic in North Toronto.  Bolan offers wonderfully complex flavours and generous portions bringing an authentic tasting take on Thai food to Mt Pleasant and Eglinton.  \"Signature dishes\" are not to be missed.  I am thankful I live in the delivery zone although the dining room is cute and cozy.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place a lot. Menu was extensive and caters to vegetarian and vegan needs. It's quiet and intimate and the free desert was just a lovely touch. Will be going back."}
{"text":"food presentation was excellent and taste is also good. met the owner who was very friendly and accommodating to our requests. only suggestion i would have is to ask how spicy their guests would like their meal. im good with spice but the other people i was with found it a tad too spicy for their liking."}
{"text":"I wandered into this place for lunch on a weekday. It's not a super noticeable joint off the street but when you walk inside, the interior is nice, quaint and quite beautiful with a lot of character. 

The service was also great. They greet you and check up ample amounts too to make sure you have what you need and are super friendly. 

I ordered the red curry dish here, which was really good. I'd recommend it if you're in the mood for curry. This place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, this restaurant is a little treasure. Also lovely presentation. Highly recommendable and also well worth the money. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic--don't skip it. Everything is great. Excellent spring rolls, fresh rolls, and deep fried mushroom. The mango salad is amazing. Best I've had. One of the best Thai places around."}
{"text":"This place is a bit or of the way, but well worth it for a delicious, beautifully plated meal. This is a smaller restaurant, but the food is great! The place is decorated well, with plenty of thai condiments for decoration, the food is flavourful- I tried the pad Ka prow (ground chicken with rice and a fried egg), made spicy per our request. Perfectly balanced. Usually restaurants throw in a bunch of chilli powered or oil to make it spicy but this was well balanced! 

We also tried the thai iced tea which was great and came separately  in this cute bulb like cup where you pour it yourself over ice. 

My friends loved their khao Soi. They had plenty of vegetarian options on their menu! 

There's street parking outside. Will definitely visit if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Not a full house tonight however a 18 minute wait for the host to take our order. Then what seemed like another 20 min for our order to arrive.  Little disappointed."}
{"text":"Bland flavours in the dishes. Jumping on hipster trend with overpriced items in smaller portions. Only saving grace, not many other Thai options in the area that are terrific either."}
{"text":"This review is for a last-minute dinner in August for from-out-of-town guests. The owners of this small but pleasant restaurant were kind, hospitable and very accommodating.  We had no problems finding parking since it was a week night, though the restaurant got full.
The food was very delicious and the presentation was aesthetically pleasing. The mushroom fritters and flavorful vegetarian pumpkin curry are particularly memorable.
The -1 star is because of the lack of a ground floor washroom, nor was there one in the vicinity, which was a problem for the older guests."}
{"text":"Had the snow shrimp (starter) and the khao soi with beef.

The snow shrimp description sounded mouth watering; however, didn't deliver the same taste.  The shrimp came covered in a type of rice krispy-esk peanut flavoured topping.  The peanut flavour really overwhelmed the shrimp and didn't go well with the shrimp.  The shrimp came with mayo sauce that helped with the taste.

The khao soi was pretty standard and nothing special.  There was plenty of sauce but I left feeling like I didn't get enough beef.

The place was quiet and service was quick."}
{"text":"I'm Thai and wanna say it is one of really nice Thai Cuisine in Toronto, can say it is authentic one because chef and staffs are Thai. Also, dishes were very fancy, have much more beautiful decoration compared with other authentic Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto. The location is a bit far, but I think it's worth to try to have a great and fancy Thai meal and sharing with your family and friends."}
{"text":"Excellent food and decor. We ordered bolan pad Thai, ka prao gai kai-dow, mango sticky rice and the free dessert from yelp. I loved the presentation of everything! Portions were great and interior was small, modern and intimate!

Everything was very flavourful and beautiful, I would definitely come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I came here for dinner with a group of friends on Friday night.  This restaurant is very small,  so I highly suggest making reservations. I would say they can at max accommodate 8 people,  but it might be tight.  We were a party of 7 people.  This location is relatively close to the subway and for people that drive,  there is street parking and a Green P parking lot across the street too.  
The servers here are friendly and nice.  I like that they constantly came to refill our water glasses without having to ask.  But they weren't over attentive either. Because it is a very small restaurant,  it is not very noisy although they are very busy. 
We decided to order dishes and a bottle of red to share.  The bottle was not expensive at all...  I thought it was very afforable.  The food here is delicious!!  I think I have found a new Thai Restaurant to frequent. The presentation of the food was pretty,  the flavors were good.  My favorite dishes I think was their signature Pad Thai and the Pineapple Fried Rice.  The Pad Thai they use a very thin noodle which is different from most Pad Thai I've had elsewhere. All the prices on their menu are all afforable.  
I am so coming back for more Thai food!!!  I think I am in love....   Lol...."}
{"text":"Got a job nearby so this was recommended to me by one or my coworkers and since I love Thai food I decided to give it a try. I got the garlic shrimp with brown rice lunch special. It was alright, not the best Thai food I've had but certainly not the worst. It came with four pieces of shrimp and the portion size was so tiny. The shrimp wasn't very flavourful or didn't really taste of any garlic. It also came with a side of Tum Yum soup (which, is one of my favourite soups ever) and it didn't disappoint. It was very flavourful and had just the right amount of spice. The takeout service was also pretty fast, I'd say I was waiting probably about 10 minutes.

Overall, I probably wouldn't get the garlic shrimp again but I would definitely try something else."}
{"text":"GREAT Thai food. Since moving to Toronto I've searched around for good Thai and out of maybe 6 places (not many really but still) this restaurant is certainly at the top. The curries, springrolls and Khao Soi noodles are delicious. Really flavourful and fresh. Looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of friends on a Sunday night. Luckily we were after the dinner rush because otherwise the place was quite busy.

After reading reviews on here I wanted to try the snow shrimp but unfortunately they were out. Our group instead ordered the mushroom fritters and deep fried tofu. We had requested peanut sauce to go with out tofu instead of what they usually served and they were accommodating. The mushroom fritters were delicious and were eaten up quickly. I'm surprised no other restaurant I've been to has served battered enoki mushrooms!

Our group got an assortment of mains and all were beautifully plated and served. Usually when this happens that means there isn't a whole lot but I must say that this place gives you proper and full servings! 

All in all it was a great experience and I was definitely pleased to have been here. The others in my party agree and I would heartily recommend others to come here for excellent Thai food in the area! Reasonable prices, good servings and beautiful presentation (a plus for those that take pictures of their meal)."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor in a petite restaurant off the main road. This little joint is packed with flavour and great lunch specials. You can choose an entree with fried wontons or soup. I chose the wontons, they were typical but my colleague chose the soup and it looked really tasty! The pad Thai is a little on the salty side but I think that's typical of Thai places right? I think next time I'll order the green curry because the rice comes in a shape of a star!! The service was alright, very quick encounters with ordering, getting the food and paying, nothing resonated with me."}
{"text":"First visit but not the last. Great Thai food.  We had the Bolan Pad Thai and the Panang Beef amd Egg both were excellent. Also had the Chicken Satay could've ordered another! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"awesome thai food...way better than Pai in downtown! Environment was great too. Really love it!"}
{"text":"I had a dinner with my friends and we shared food which allowed me to try a few dishes. I loved mango salad and fresh rolls. The ingredients were all very fresh and perfectly balanced. Bolan Pad thai  was great and it had a quite unique composition and again very nice balance (ginger chicken with rice is also good). I had mango sticky rice as a desert and this thing is great! And again it is about the right balance. 
I can say that it was one of my best dinners and it was the first time I tried thai food of such high quality. 
Also a few words about the interior. It's a wonderful place for a cozy dinner.  The restaurant has a home atmosphere, nice and clean interior with soft light and good background music. It's a kind of atmosphere when East meets West. 
Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a little mom and pop shop that just opened a year ago. They are very good at making EVERYTHING! I enjoyed the mojito, Mai Thai, Thai ice tea, and BBQ chicken with papaya salad and sticky rice. The service is slow but the taste and presentation make up for it all!! I love the care they take into making you feel like you're in Thailand. The ambiance filled with bottles of fish sauce is neat too."}
{"text":"A nice hidden gem of a Thai restaurant. The prices were fair and I really liked the sauce. We had the pad thai (It was a tad too spicey for my partner's taste) and I had the crispy beef (sauce was too good, but the beef itself didn't have too much taste). Portion sizes are great. The ambiance was great for a date night as it was cozy and there weren't that many other tables, but we weren't the only people there. 

Service: 4/5
Food: 5.5/5 
Price: 5/5

Overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Bolan is now my FAVOURITE Thai restaurant - and as an avid lover of Thai food, that is no small feat! Came with a group of 5 and tried the Pad Thai, Khao Soi, Som Tum, Penang Curry, spring rolls, and Mango Mousse - and ALL of us could not stop talking about how DELICIOUS the food was. My mouth is watering as I reminisce. 

Their presentation is also a 11/10 - the staff truly put effort into handcrafting a dining experience. Their service was also great - the Yelp check-in offer is only valid for one free dessert per table, but the owner gave us two on the house. For $20 for a delicious, filling 3-course meal (shared) - I am DEFINITELY coming back!"}
{"text":"I went to Bolan for dinner on a weeknight -- there was one other table occupied so we were seated right away. The decor is sleek and inviting.

We had the Ka-prao Gai Kai-dow ($15.95) and it was delicious; minced chicken sauteed with veggies and spicy chili oil and topped with a fried egg (you know, the kind with the crispy edges? *drool*) served on a bed of rice. The Bolan Pad thai ($15.95) was also really tasty, wrapped in a egg crepe. 

The service was fast and friendly; coupled with the food it was a solidly good experience. One star off only for the price -- I found it a bit on the pricey side, to be expected for Midtown Toronto. However, I think chipping in the couple extra bucks is worth it compared to Thai chains in the area that serve salty mushy pad thai. 

Bolan may not be as trendy as other Thai spots in the city, but if you're on Mount Pleasant you'll realize it's anything but trendy, so kinda makes sense -- plus, it makes it easier for you to park and get a table. The food and service made me definitely want to come back if I want delicious Thai food in Midtown."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Thai restaurant with very fresh and delicious food! We tried both the green and yellow curries and loved both."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly good Thai for the neighbourhood.  Walked by a couple of times while the place was being constructed and judging by the kitschy decor, it's was difficult to tell if this was going to be underwhelming Thai joint more interested in selling shitty beer (i.e. Salad King) or the real deal.

Happy to report - the food is excellent - bright flavours, fresh ingredients and I must admit, solid packaging.  If it says anything, the lady and I ate there once and ordered (free) delivery from Bolan in the same week (we were extremely lazy that week).

Had a few of their 'signature' dishes and nothing has disappointed yet.  The khao soi gai had very tasty curry and I would say it's one of the better examples in the GTA.  The ka-prao gai kai-dow was very well-balanced.  Their signature pad thai is made with glass noodles and wrapped in a egg crepe - never had it like that before and we liked it a lot.

I will say - the price/portion value is not the best.  If you're expecting a big honking plate of ketchup-y noodles for $10 - you won't find it here.  The portions are pretty modest and the signature dishes start at $14 (though, on the menu, I noticed they have $9 M-F lunch specials from 11A - 3:30P).  That said, this is legit Thai food and I feel the quality matches the price point.

The place is still pretty new, but I have a feeling this is going to be a regular haunt for me."}
{"text":"Excellent place! Well located, nice deco...
Great customer service, spring rolls and tapioca mango desert were AMAZING! Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"All Thai restaurants in Toronto should watch out for this one! Other than its location of not being in the downtown core area, its food was just over the top! All dishes were not just beautifully presented but tasted amazing! The snow shrimp is a must order dish in my opinion - its a twist to shrimp tempura deep fried with popped rice bites(super crunchy!) Although the store claims its the first in market to serve Pad Thai in an egg crepe, Linda's @ Shops on Don Mills actually served it years ago but the use of mung bean noodles really allowed the flavours to be integrated with the noodles and the sweet and sourness was just right. My friend ordered the Pad Sew Ew and in her words, it brought her back to the days in Thailand!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from Bolan the other night, food was terrific, everything was fresh and delicious. We used the online ordering option which was super easy and had a neat feature that allowed you to schedule delivery time, I was able to place an order early in the day for an 8pm delivery.

Looking forward to ordering from there again."}
{"text":"We have been going to Bolan so often since we discovered it that we were really disappointed last month when we found the chicken to have a very strange taste. My boyfriend and I were both very sick that night. I don't think we'll be able to step on this place again."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best, if not the best, Thai restaurants I've been to so far in Toronto. It's been a long time since I've had very good Thai food, so this was definitely a welcome and refreshing experience. The pad kee mao was flavourful and filled with so many different layers of flavour--the way Thai food should be, unlike most Thai places that serve up very one-dimensional dishes where one flavour dominates the rest. Dishes are nicely presented. Service is friendly and efficient. It's a small place, seems like a mom and pop shop. Only about 25 seats or so. It's nonetheless nicely decorated with a bit of charm. Good luck to them!"}
{"text":"Pineapple fried rice was soggy. Pad thai was too sweet and flavourless. Not sure why there are such good reviews of this place. The service was good, seems like they're nice people but the food was gross."}
{"text":"I've dined here once or twice and I get delivery from them quite often. They have a wide selection of thai food and the quality is much better than most garden-variety thai restaurants around."}
{"text":"Bolan Thai is a great small little place that offers delicious Thai food located at Yonge and Eglinton. My first impression of the place was that it is small but the decor is quite interesting. There is a shelf attached to the wall with bottles of soy sauce from Thailand and Thai spices. On a humid day the AC is not very strong but they have two fans to cool the place down. In terms of the seats they are mainly wooden tables.

Their orange coloured menus are unique, small, and interesting to flip through in terms of the design. The menu is bounded by a plastic spiral holder and each page includes a picture of a destination from Thailand. It was like flipping through a photo book or a postcard collection

They offer lots of variety. For instance they have variations of red curry such as peanut red curry or pineapple red curry. I decided to try the pineapple red curry.

My first impression was that the presentation is very cute as it comes with rice that is moulded into a star shape so it makes it fun to eat. The portions are good as well and comes with a good amount of chicken.

As for dessert I highly recommend the mango sticky rice. The presentation was very good and too pretty to want to eat it. The taste was amazing as well as there was lots of coconut flavour. The mangos were sliced, sweet, fresh, and wrapped around the sticky rice like a flower. The texture if the rice was a little hard but I believe it is meant to be like that. What an amazing way to finish off a good meal.

I had forgotten but you can also check in to Yelp to try the dessert of the day.

The service was great and the food preparation was quick as well
Great place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service here was super friendly and professional, but I found the spring rolls AND the Pad Thai were both way too sweet. It tasted like there was much more sugar in the sauce for the Pad Thai, than most places seem to add. I prefer a more savoury style of Pad Thai, I guess. Everyone else seems to love the Pad Thai here, though; don't let that stop you from trying this place."}
{"text":"This is a great cozy place to chill and eat. The food is great, quite authentic. Great service as well. Maybe not as great for large groups like 8plus as the place isnt too big. But still great for smaller groups. Tried the Bolan Pad thai which was great. Also had the bolan thai iced team, loved it as well. For dessert had the mango sticky rice which was probably my favorite part of the meal. My girlfriend has the thai fried beef with curry which was good too. Crispy beef was really good. She has the ice cream with tapioca for dessert which was ok, not as special as the sticky rice. Staff was friendly as well. Overall very good food and service."}
{"text":"One of the nicer Thai restos in the city when it comes to decor and ambience. But the food doesn't hold up to what i now believe is a higher standard in toronto for Thai fare. 

With so many new trendy legit Thai places to choose from, at considerably lower price points it's hard to give bolan more than 3 stars. 

Curry was good (had the green curry with fish but i think it was a basa filet, previously frozen. (Would probably cost about $3 at your local T&T). Mango chicken was decent. Pad Thai was a bit small and the noodles were overly mushy (too cooked?). 

They give you a cool star shaped pile of rice but it's about half of what you need to sop up all the yummy curry sauce. To be fair I asked for more and they didn't charge me. And I asked for chilli oil and they didn't have any!

Not a bad place but I've had better. Still if you happen to want Thai for a special occasion dinner this might be the place to go."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely terrible. Beef panang was very odd, the beef was served separate and was deep fried, repulsive, the curry sauce was delicious though. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Bolan Thai is my favourite place to go whenever I am craving authentic Thai food. I discovered it by accident when I moved into the area and I still think it's an relatively undiscovered little gem of a restaurant in this area. I have tried every single one of their signature dishes: Bolan Pad Thai, Panang Curry Beef with Boiling Egg, Khao Soi Gai are my favourites. Their Spicy Eggplant dish is a must try vegetarian dish too. The decor of the place is lovely too, decorated with nostalgic pieces from Thailand that seems to have come from the owner's personal collection. The presentation of their Pad Thai was unique as well, served with the egg wrapping the noodles like an omelette, which made eating it a lot of fun for me. Give this place a try if you haven't already! Definite recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to Thailand before but I have to say that this restaurant makes better Thai food than most of restaurants I've been in Thailand 

They offer great quality food, however very affordable, especially lunch menu 

I will definitely keep coming back"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai good with great service.  
I went with my friends for get together and ordered most from their special menu.   Love the special pad tai.  They used glass noodle which absorb most of the sauce.  The snow shrimp is a most try... The batter is crispy with soft shrimp in the middle .... The sticky rice is definitely a must try.... Soft with nice coconut aroma.  This is absolutely better then Pai in downtown.  I will rather come here beacuae the parking.  There is a indoor level parking across the street, street parking and parking lot up the street."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant, the food is not only delicious but is also well presented. I've eaten here a number of times and also ordered delivery twice from here. The food has been great everytime. I've had their signature Boland special pad thai, their normal pad thai, other noodle dishes, green curry and spring rolls."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food with great plate presentation. Quality Thai food for the same price as your corner fake corner Thai place! Tried the snow shrimp, the pad Thai and the khao soi gai and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times with friends. I really enjoy the Khao Soi and the pumpkin soup. A small quaint little places with some deliciously authentic flavours. Definitely glad I checked it out and I would come back."}
{"text":"This place is the best Thai place i found. Better than Linda Thai. Small and cozy. They have authentic Thai dishes and also desert. Lunch special is good price too!"}
{"text":"Bolan Thai is another one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto. 

Located Mid town, there is always ample parking on the side streets. An option for me if I don't feel like TTC downtown for some decent Thai food.

Service is warm and Thai friendly.

Snow Shrimp - Beautifully plated, tastes light and crispy
Red Pineapple Curry with Chicken - Nice flavour and they able to make it mild
Bolan Pad Thai - I love Pad Thai wrapped in an egg crepe! Just like the street food I had in Chiang Mai

Worth checking Bolan Thai Cuisine if you have craving for some good Thai food!"}
{"text":"I see there are good ratings here. It was not my experience but then maybe it's a matter of taste. 

I think the place recently open. To be upfront, I went there for their lunch special so maybe it's different for dinner.

I had the chili chicken with vegetables/rice along with some kind of soup that tasted like squash. Unfortunately the chicken was sparse and the sauce was blast. It was one of the worse Thai meals I have ever experienced and I have eaten a lot of Thai food. In addition, the soup was horrible but again perhaps it's my incredible sense of taste LOL! 

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Very nice small  place with excellent service! I took the Bolan Pad Thai, and that's the best one I've ever tasted. For that price, don't waste your money in fast food pad Thai restaurant!!"}
