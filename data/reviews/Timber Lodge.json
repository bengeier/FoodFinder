{"text":"Great food and we have always had a great experience.  My only request would be to bring back the pork chop with baked apples permanently.  It was a great menu item and I miss it!"}
{"text":"All the food is terrific but if you're a prime rib fan, don't go anywhere else.  Not the cheapest place around but for really good food, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"My family and I have been dining at Timber Lodge (formerly Steve ' s Dakota Grill) for many years.   We've always had an excellent dining experience.   The staff is friendly and attentive and the steaks are absolutely delicious!   Save room for dessert because the brownie delight and bread pudding are  enough to share and awesome as well!  Anytime we visit other steakhouses it's simply not the same!  The owner Ron is always available and is very involved in the entire operation ensuring his guests have a pleasurable dining experience!"}
{"text":"We have celebrated two New Year's Eves at Timber Lodge.  They have been outstanding!  If a restaurant can turn out wonderful food and maintain quality service on such a busy night, that is the sign of a great restaurant.  We also patronize Timber Lodge during the year and always leave very satisfied.

{"text":"Very popular, expect a wait on the week-end. Got a salad with beef on it, delish.  I would go back."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I really liked this place. Portions are huge and food was seasoned well. Very cute decor inside. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent the Timber Lodge often as it's a way to meet in the middle with his parents since we live in Lakewood and they live in Cuyahoga Falls, and get some excellent food! Our favorite starter is the French onion soup, simply the best! The specials are always explained well and sound delicious, the cuts of meat are well prepared and flavorful! We are greeted promptly and our server is knowledgeable and courteous.  If you are in the area stop by and check it out, you're in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Timber Lodge is a casual steakhouse. Delicious, and expensive, but worth it--the portions are huge.

Two words: prime rib. You'd be a fool to come here and not order it as it's what they are known for.

We also ordered a special: three lobster tails and three scallops. The lobster tails were a little bland, but that's nothing some butter and salt can't fix. The scallops were cooked to beyond perfection, as if that were possible. They are served with some sort of red pepper aioli. I loved it, but if you aren't a peppers person, you aren't going to enjoy it.

The kitchen messed up one of our lobster tails and management was extremely accommodating about it. They replaced it with an 8 ounce lobster tail (instead of the 4 ounce). 

I recommend getting the mashed potatoes as one of the sides.

Our server Alysa was nice and friendly and very knowledgable about the menu and restaurant.

My only complaint? The wine glasses. They felt cheap and looked cheap, but that's just me being a wine snob."}
{"text":"Love the food and atmosphere.  Always a busy place, so arrive early. Prime rib,  steaks,  seafood,  lobster  bisque...have tried and enjoyed them all. Can't wait to dine here again!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch with a large group on Sunday morning. Wonderful service and food. I had steak and eggs, A+. Other members of the party had chicken'n'waffles & roulade (both delicious). Glad they share!  Great atmosphere and other specials."}
{"text":"Every visit the rating gets lower and lower. Clearly this place does well and doesn't need business or care about keeping customers since they treat customers so rude!!!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 8 all though our dinners were great  and service prompt. A very pleasant evening."}
{"text":"Prices are a bit steep, food is of higher quality and their steaks, prime rib, and cuts are good. Service is mediocre since there are many younger waiters/waitresses who are not so experienced for the type of price you pay and ambience you expect."}
{"text":"Food was good but the heads staring at me was unappetizing. Nice decor otherwise. Just get rid of the taxidermy in at least one area of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love that we were greeted at the door by a nicely dressed young man who asked us if we would like to dine outside which we agreed that we would.  We later find out that the dining room was full with a waiting list but instead of going inside to be told of a wait time we were instead greeted and invited to sit outside.  Very classy.  Our waitress was very well trained and informed about the menu, the wine and drink specials, and the food specials and presented it all in a charming way.  The menu is diverse with something for everyone.  We love that nothing here is frozen and all is fresh. And you can totally taste it.  I had the red snapper in garlic cream sauce which was delectable.  It was Presented beautifully with two asparagus spears on top and a side of perfectly cooked slightly crispy green beans.  My husband had the halibut with asparagus and raved about it and my son had spaghetti and meatballs and loved it.  It is a bit pricey and the atmosphere is rustic but the food and attentiveness of staff make it completely worth it. Our only negative is that the PA system blared out the next party to be seated. It had nice soft jazz style music playing and then interrupted by the loud announcement of a table ready.  I think investing in buzzers or texting to cell phones would be much better.  But We will for sure be going back.  Especially for the fresh seafood."}
{"text":"Last evening we returned to the Timber Lodge for a special dinner. Our last visit was when it was a Steve Dakota's. Same owner similar menu. Specializes in steaks and chops. Also has some seafood items on the menu but we went for steak. Our waitress Lisa was terrific as well as the rest of the staff. Spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer. Very good. Wife ordered a small sirloin and I went for the prime rib. Steaks come with a small salad and a choice of sides. Salads cold and very fresh. For sides we both chose garlic smashed potatoes with \"the works\" toppings. Very tasty but they were very large. Next time one of us will order the potatoes and the other will order a veggie and share. Plenty for two. Steak was very good but my wife described it as a little chewy. Prime rib cooked to a perfect medium rare. Had a wonderful evening and brought home a dessert. We would surely go back. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"The steak!!! It's so wonderful.

Timber Lodge is a great place for a relaxing, delicious dinner. The steaks are to die for and the service has always been really good. It's our favorite place to go in Medina and I recommend it to anyone - except maybe vegetarians."}
{"text":"ASK FOR KIM! She was the best server ever! Very polite, knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. We didn't have to ask for anything. And she kept the drinks coming. The entire staff was great. The food was excellent! I had their signature prime rib and it was so tender and juicy. This is not a \"cheap place to eat.\" However, the portions are huge and you do get your money's worth. Well worth the drive from Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! This has been our favorite steak and seafood stop for years. Today, we celebrated our anniversary for dinner with our son. Amber was a great help and our meals were wonderful, incredibly quick and perfectly timed. As usual, our experience gets an A+! We will be back."}
{"text":"Tried the Lobster special last weeek. Lobsters were good size and succulent!
The trimmings were also excellent!
Our server, Becky, was spectacular and really made the meal a memorable experience.
Am returning for a celebratory dinner next week with 5 other couples and have alresdy arranged for Becky to be our waitress.
Highly recommended to be sure!"}
{"text":"Ah-ma-zing! We were promptly seated and greeted by our server Becky. We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and entrees, all of which were delivered with perfect timing. The steaks were seasoned to perfection & cocked exactly as we had ordered. Our waitress really knew what she was doing, and had a great attitude! We will definitely be back, thanks Becky!"}
{"text":"50 minute wait for two ended up only being 30 on a Saturday night. Spacious bar provided an excellent Bud Light draft, and an overly liquored blue drink I can't really remember the name of. Server was Becky, she's great. Very professional and knowledgable and just really nice. Had appealing chef specials, but we both decided on a simple sirloin steak for each of us and a 1 pound lobster to share. Bread and salad came out at reasonable times, homemade ranch dressing was intriguing and I wanted more. Entrees also came out in a reasonable time. Breaking down own lobster turned out to be a little messy and time consuming. But it was cooked well and tasted great with the butter. Steaks were cooked as specified, but seemed bland and in need of some type of seasoning despite the awesome side of onion straws. Highly recommend the pumpkin cheesecake for dessert. Despite some bland steaks the overall experience was great and would have no problem returning and trying other menu items."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was good. Why 3 star? Well, for my wife and I we got 1 appetizer, 2 steaks, and two 8oz lobster tails. The bill? $140 BEFORE tip. No alcohol, just food for 2. The 8oz lobster tails were $35 each. So, while the food was good, at those prices, you're putting yourself in competition with upscale Cleveland restaurants. If you want me to pay upscale Cleveland prices, you better deliver upscale Cleveland quality. And this was not upscale Cleveland quality."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice. The wait staff friendly and knowledgable. The prime rib was delicious. The wine selection was a bit less than spectacular...but otherwise I would definately recommend a visit. We were told the seafood is a must try and I intend to try it on my next visit."}
{"text":"Very large portions, bone in strip was almost as good as the chocolate cake.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Well Timber Lodge, you did it again.  Another delicious meal.  My husband made me try something different,  although I really didn't want to. Tonight I tried the ribs.  I'm kind of picky on ribs, don't like them to fatty,  they have to be fall of the bone(hate when they get stuck between your teeth,  even though I carry floss every where I go), not to spicy,  not to saucy either. You nailed it! Mm, mm, mm. One thing bad here. ..you're making my decisions harder each visit!!! Keep it up! :)"}
{"text":"Affordable, delicious, and high quality service! We go once a month and the consistency is always there."}
{"text":"Took the family and some friends for my son's 21st birthday. Excellent prime rib and steak.  Kim our server was even better, highly recommend."}
{"text":"My family used to love this place.  Now I don't think we will be back. My wife ordered her burger med-well, same for my steak. We had to send her burger back and after all that I didn't want to send my steak back too. I spoke to a manager and I wasn't asking for money off but he needed to let the kitchen know they are sending food out to quick. Instead he said he checked on us earlier and I didn't ask to send my steak back. So I guess it's my fault not the kitchen staff. Poor response and I even said I don't want money off just giving constructive feedback. I hope the dog won't mind the rare leftovers. Definitely not coming back, more from management response than the ooops on our food."}
{"text":"It's always a pleasure to dine here.  Food and atmosphere is amazing.  Staff very knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"I was a fan of this place even when it was known as Steve's Dakota Grill. I was really surprised to find a steakhouse this nice and this good in the middle of nowhere in Medina. The food is absolutely wonderful. I've gotten prime rib here and I have had the porterhouse a few times. My wife is had prime red and lobster. Have probably been here about nine times and have never been disappointed. The relaxed atmosphere is also enjoyable. I would never wear a T-shirt to this place although I've seen some people do it. They have a nice wine selection as well as quite a few beers. The steakhouse discussion on the yelp thread made me remember that I have an yelp this place yet!"}
{"text":"We were promptly seated just before the dinner rush and our waitress, Becky, was pleasant and professional. We ordered the calamari appetizer, which was delicately breaded and flavorful. I ordered the prime rib and could not recommend it because it tasted like it was prepared in advance, was dry, and had no marble. Tony ordered the halibut that was approximately 8 oz. but cost $28. Overall, I view this as a three-star   restaurant worthy of a night out but at four-star prices."}
{"text":"I didnt want to leave a bad review but after contacting  Lynsey at the restaurant through email she really didnt care to help me. Which is a shame because they have some really great reviews on their service. I ordered the beef wellington which should have been great for the price I paid but it had a soggy bottom crust and a sickening sweet demiglaze that ruined it. The restaurant was cold and drafty that day so the waitress Whitney gave me the option to substitute a soup for the salad. What she didnt inform us was that there was an upcharge. We were not aware of this beforehand and when we asked her about it she just drifted away. It took awhile to get our check and I heard other gusts complain too. You see they must have been having a kitchen christmas party because at first they were in pajamas and then disappeared to change throughout our meal. I should have spoke with a manager before we paid for the meal but they were visibly busy and I figured that an email would suffice. thats the last time I let anything slide."}
{"text":"Been here once the food is a little pricey but it also depends on the cook in the kitchen or on duty."}
{"text":"Fun staff, warm and cozy with fireplace on a snowy winter night, and great food all made for a lovely evening. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Loved it! The wait staff is friendly and patient. The food is delicious and presented beautifully! I got the prime rib and it was phenomenal! The chefs selected dessert was bread pudding and it was by far the best bread pudding I've ever had! I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Timber Lodge. Danielle and i went there on our first date and have been back a few times since. 

So many great food options. obviously the steaks are great but they have great seafood options as well. and some pastas. 

I stick with the steaks. i've tried a few of them and am actually partial to the fairly inexpensive \"Flat Iron\" Steak Marsala. it's topped with a delicious marsala mushroom sauce. mmmm. 

D always gets the salmon (as she doesn't eat beef - and it was her idea to eat here) and just loves it. 

they have a pretty decent selection of beers w/ a beautiful bar in the center of the place. 

ugh, just thinking of it makes me want to go back there right now. 

the only complaint i've ever had was based on our first visit. Danielle had a gift card. she wasn't sure how much was left on it. our bill was about $52. i had $100 bills (y'all!) left over from my Christmas bonus and used one to pay the bill. turns out the gift card had $50 on it. instead of coming back and asking if i had smaller bills, the server broke the 100 for $2 and change. nitpicking, sure. It just seemed weird to me. whatever."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place to order steak or any seafood dish in medina. The wine list is extensive and has many suggestions of which dishes to pair them with. The waiters and waitress are very knowledgeable of the menu and the specials. It's more expensive compared to the other restaurants in Medina (longhorn, Applebee's, panera, chipotle, Arby's, etc). You can taste the price. It is worth it."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere service was above and beyond Jamie was fantastic! Food was Excellent try the stuffed mushrooms lobster bisque wasn't my favorite but it was different."}
{"text":"Seriously the best restaurant in medina. The owner is there every weekend, he truly cares about his staff and the quality of service and dining that his customers get. The food is always superb, the staff is beyond gracious. We bring all our family and out of town guests and the reaction is always positive. Their brunch is delicious too, the $.99 bloody Mary's keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Timber Lodge! What can I say. It doesn't get better for steaks and great food. By far my favorite restaurant in the state. I have been here over a dozen times. I have never once had a bad meal or a so so meal. This restaurant is amazingly consistent. I dove into their porterhouse steak last night. Excellent cut of beef. No salt or steak sauce needed here. I also had to get the baked potato with butter and sour cream. It's a meal in itself. I have tried the prime rib several times. It's delish. Their seafood is fresh and cooked properly. A place like this makes it hard to get apps because you know you don't want to fill up, but the rib logs can not be overlooked. Really well done BBQ. To top things off, this place knows how to pour drinks. If going on a Saturday night, leave yourself enough time for a table. Like I said, have a drink and wait. Then be ready to throw down like a king. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good Lord...back to the same ole same ole....waiting forever and ever and attitude with service.  Come on Timber..get it together...I'm sitting here at a Half empty bar for 52min w one drink and no food order.   I'm staring at management..you have got to be able to,see the unraveling!"}
{"text":"We come here often and the food and service are always excellent. Steaks are very good and they have great daily specials. Our waitress Allie was impeccable. A wonderful place for any occasion."}
{"text":"Our first time at Timber Lodge. We arrived around 5:30 and were seated immediately. The ambiance is so intimate and cozy. The service is above par. Our waitress was thorough without being overbearing. My prime rib was perfectly cooked and tender. Seasoned just right with a touch of rosemary and the Asiago mashed potatoes were out of this world. All of their sauces and dressings are made in house. We will most definitely be returning and recommending this place to others!"}
{"text":"I would have liked to give this review a higher rating.  We were a party of four out for a birthday dinner.  Most of food was very good overall.  They do have some flaws.  The service was good but needs improvement.  The server was a friendly but seemed little too eager to push certain items.  First the server greeted us with a bottle of wine they wanted to sell at $29 a bottle which we did get.  She mentioned the specials but did not give any prices for the items.

One in our party had the lobster special which was very good.  Another had the prime rib which was good but nothing special.  It did not have much flavor.  Two others in our party had the rack of lamb which ended up being $45.00 each which was not mentioned by the server.  We should have asked.  There did not seem to be very much on the plate and had this sweet sauce of the lamb.

The table that we had was very cramped for four people and were stuck under a hot heating vent.   The server did spill the wine twice.  Also when grating the cheese she got it all over the place including my pants.

Overall I think the meal could have been a little better for what they are charging.  We got there right at opening and by the time we left there was a line out the door.  It was a Saturday.  If you do decide to go here stick with the printed menu items."}
{"text":"Amazing place. First time out here. Beautiful ambience very nice people . Luved the rustic atmosphere. Great selections of wines and super selections of food. Enjoyed the live maine lobster feast. The fresh clams were amazing.  Tim at the bar is a great guy and made it a wounderful experience. Angie was super awesome and took great care of us. Yes this place is 5 ***** all the way. Would highly recommend this place. 
Thx 
DR MD"}
{"text":"Always excellent food.  Usually a wait so plan for that.  Sitting on the porch by the fireplace is wonderful when the weather nice."}
{"text":"Ordered the clams appetizer.  I normally don't like clams.  These were delicious.  The sauce they were cooked in was fabulous!  Could have made a meal of the clams and the bread rolls.  Great for dunking !!  Highly recommend.  Our waitress, Kim, was great.  Will definitely ask for her again."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been since the name change. 

The food, as usual, was amazing! The filet mirth non was cooked perfectly and was juicy. The mashed potatoes were on par and the Caesar salad didn't have too much dressing on it like many places. 

I give the overall rating 3 stars because of the service. The bartenders were rude and impatient. The waitress seemed bored and uninterested."}
{"text":"Went there recently for father's day and honestly, I knew what I was in for. Can't expect 5 star service on one of the busiest days in food service. However the service wasn't what docked this down a star. Our service, although understandably a bit slow- was decent, and I have no complaints. My main gripe was that it was literally 82 degrees inside the restaurant - I looked at the thermostat that was right by our booth. LITERALLY 82 Degrees. The poor kitchen staff, when I walked out after paying I told my dad this was the first dining experience that I left feeling like I needed a shower. I couldn't even enjoy my food. I got the beef Wellington that had a much too sweet Demi-glace, it was almost as if you could taste the worst parts of the wine without the flavor, which I didn't particularly care for, but chalked it up to the heat. When I got home I very much enjoyed my left overs san heat and san Demi-glace. The Asiago mashed potatoes were phenomenal and the Wellington was cooked perfect. Well probably go back sometime in the fall, I think."}
{"text":"The best value for your money in the Medina area.  Our server, Carolyn, was very welcoming, knowledgeable, and professional.  Food was outstanding.  Beautiful decor.  Great for everyone--groups, families, or just a nice night out for two."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here for dinner and was not disappointed. You are approached my friendly, smiling faces who opens the door for you and are seated with the same positive attitude. Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu (thanks for giving us all the guidance, Becky!) and thoroughly explained the specials and what paired well with what. I settled for the surf and turfed with was three, two ounce filet mignon and three scallops. Both were cooked to perfection! You get an option of cesar or house salad and one side item. The side item is of good portion!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful experience! My husband and I went on a Friday night. They were busy but able to seat us immediately. The bread and butter was SO good. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable of the menu and nicely explained everything to us. We ordered the surf and turf with the 1lb lobster tail and it was possibly the best steak and lobster I've ever had. We were thoroughly pleased with our meal and dining choice for the evening and we will certainly be going back as soon as possible! This would be a great place to celebrate a special occasion or just to treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Definitely our new favorite steakhouse. Came for the prime rib which did not disappoint. The seafood looked delicious as well, and The specials almost changed our mind. They advertise Sunday brunch which we will definitely be back for. So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! We were in town from Buffalo, this was one of the recommended spots for dinner.We were nervous though, because the reviews for \"Dakota Grill\" were less than impressive.(We didn't know there had been changes).We decided to try it out anyway and whoa! Very impressed.The spinach artichoke dip was the best we have ever tried, and we order it at every opportunity. 

The pasta dishes were just as amazing as the steak dinners.My Bloody Mary was perfect.Even the salads that come with the main course were well above the average.

Very cozy space,great service and reasonable prices.I wish it was local to us!"}
{"text":"Our first time was yesterday, New Years Eve. Well worth the wait. I had the most wonderful Chilean sea bass I have ever had, Caesar salad, garlic smashed potatoes and asparagus. Hubby had filet and scallops, all were beyond belief. Def going back. Anxious to try their brunch on Sundays as people had a lot of good things to say."}
{"text":"First time at Timber Lodge and it was amazing.  Our server, Laura, was so friendly and very knowledgeable.  She was attentive to our needs and made us feel very welcomed.  We all ordered the prime rib and it was \"perfection.\"  I've been searching for a great prime rib for a long time and the Timber Lodge has it.  They have a nice wine list with wines that anyone can afford.  Meal portions are substantial, you won't leave hungry.  Prices are right.  No doubt we will be back and will be recommending the Timber Lodge to our friends and family.  My family got a big laugh out of how excited I was that there was even \"mouth wash\" in the restroom.  What a nice touch!  Thanks again for a wonderful birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Prime rib, and scallops were delicious. They were done perfectly! Good service, food, and atmosphere. The owner was there to greet us! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Havent eaten here yet because they wouldnt seat us for a table of 4 until the rest of our party showed up. I can understand this if the restaurant was busy but it wasnt even close to it on a Friday night at 545pm. We are going to a different place for our appetizers and a drink since they didn't want our business and will go back 5 min before our friends show up. And then we probably wont go back. What a stupid policy."}
{"text":"If you are going to splurge, go here! We always try to pick a super fancy place for date night,Since we don't do it often, and this place caught my attention. Nestled off on a side road, this lodge has all the rustic feels you are looking for without giving up the quality of food! I suggest you try really any of their appetizers, we had the seafood stuffed mushrooms and the calamari with three dipping sauces, both were amazingly flavorful. I got the 12oz Delmonico and my fiancé got the 14oz prime rib. The flavor on the steak was so good, when they say cooked over an open flame they mean it, and it doesn't lack in taste! Becky was our server, she was very knowledgeable, and attentive, asking if we needed anything, and bringing our refills.  Overall, we will be back here again, well worth it and for the amount of food we got, the check was not that expensive. Also, get the berry sangria if you go, best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Went on Christmas Eve was looking forward to a fabulous meal but instead it wasn't what I thought it was worth.  Ordered Prime Rib Rare.. made sure I told the waitress as rare as possible.  Instead it came out medium...I would of complained but it seemed the waitress was having a complaining customer at the table next to use so being in the spirit of Christmas I just let it go.  But next time I will surely speak up especially when your paying a pretty penny to get prime rib.  Everything else was fine."}
{"text":"Hands down, THE best steak joint in the area. The prices aren't even worth mentioning as the QUALITY of their food is simply amazing! If you are anywhere NEAR the area, Timber Lodge is a MUST stop. No questions about it. The 24 oz porterhouse is easily the best menu item they have, or maybe their prime rib, THATS the best....unless you count their TWO POUND LOBSTER TAIL....this is too hard. It's ALL good!!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with the lack of customer service this place demonstrated.  On a Sunday night when there were plenty of open tables, they took over 45 minutes to seat a party of 6.  The waitress was not very friendly. and to top it all off, they ran out of the lobster that they were promoting.  granted they offered a lobster tail for the same price, but for the cost of the meal money could be spend at a restaurant that wanted you there.  The food was good though."}
{"text":"Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. The prime rib here is the best in Medina county. I recommend ordering off menu. If you ask, you can order as large as a piece that you want!! And it wasn't that much more expensive for 4 oz more and that's a lot of prime rib! They had call ahead seating at one point - make sure you do that!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. It's my favorite for special occasions  Decor is fantastic like the medina of yesteryear.  But the food. The food is the best. The 1 pound lobster tail is always made just right. The sweetness is just right. The consistency is just right  never ever a disappointment.  
Now the steaks.  People come from miles around for the steaks.  They make a filet taste like a sirloin and it melts in your mouth. Just cut it with a fork. Mussels are unique in the flavor they have.  Man don't miss this place   Pricy but worth every penny. And the wait staff is also top notch"}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite and most consistent restaurants for both food and service. Alas, I must take away a star for a recent evenings event. We had a party of 6 ( not 12 or 20 mind you). We called ahead and were told they did not take reservations or call aheads on the weekend. So we got there, put our name in and were told it would be maybe half an hour. I'm fairly sure they were not completely full but 45 minutes later we left. It is a no brainer to push two tables together. It's hard to believe they can only accommodate 1 party at a time of more than 4 people. It was a very poor way to treat customers and a shame because I'm pretty sure there are 6 people that won't return. There are many restaurants in the Medina area so I wouldn't think an establishment would want to turn anyone away."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and have yet to be disappointed 
Waite staff is top notch nod to John and Beckie 
Great prime rob and everything else we've ordered 
The carrot cake has ruined me every where else 
It is so good"}
{"text":"Timber Lodge is the place my family knows we can always go to for an amazing meal. It's almost always the place everybody in my family wants to go to celebrate something. It's my favorite place to go to, to fully embrace being a carnivore because their prime rib is AMAZING! Literally the best, most flavorful pieces of meat you can have. It's cooked to absolute perfection. Their Jams are HUGE and delicious. The specials they feature always sound incredible, but I can never pass up the prime rib. My brothers often get the different featured seafood and always rave about how delicious and fresh it is. The desserts they have are also awesome! They have a chocolate tower cake, that goes above and beyond let me tell you. 

My favorite memory of Timber Lodge, is when the food comes, and I get to eat like a Queen."}
{"text":"Head's Up, Timber Lodge aka Pine Tree Inn!  I read that although this is ONLY a new name to Steve's Dakota Grill, I also read that they kept the former chefs and restaurant management.  BE WARNED that means if you see the \"For Hiring\" sign is constantly out front, it means that the same BAD COOKING HABITS of the kitchen manager still are there.  It also means that the new people they bring on aboard see the disgusting nature of the Kitchen and what goes on with people's food.  I guarantee you that means the Kitchen Manger is still putting his licked fingers in people's steaks and other food before it gets served.  How disgusting!  Why doesn't the Health Department do something about the managers here?  Do not go here during Shift Change either.  YOU ARE TOTALLY IGNORED!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Best French onion soup and prime Rib around. Call ahead seating, no reservations- bummer. Full menu available at the bar, as well as bar menu."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a steak. Lovely atmosphere for dining here, has a lodge like style with a cozy feel.

-Plenty of choices on the menu.
-French onion soup is delicious.
-Salads are nice here, they do a great job with them.
-Steaks are winners here, had almost all the cuts and they have great flavor and quality.

Been coming here for years and always had a great meal. Solid choice for a steak house."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous Father's Day dinner today. All of our meals were delicious, the service (thank you John & Angie) was superb! We left very pleased! Thank you to everyone for working hard on this special day!"}
{"text":"Huge plates. Delicious. Kim, our serve was phenomonal. Family of 4 for dinner had: Prime rib and lobster tail with smashed garlic potatoes; Delmonico, loaded baked potato; Filet mignon, sweet potato; Strip Steak, asparagus. Clam chowder, onion soup, calamari for appetizer. Adult rootbeer float for dessert. SO MUCH FOOD.

We were the first table of the new year, celebrating a birthday and it couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"First visit. Sunday Brunch and regular menu offered. I ordered Prime Rib from the regular menu with Asiago mashed potatoes.  Bread was warm and fresh. The house salad was not fresh. Looked like it came from a bag and had been plated for a while before it was served.
My meal was excellent and so was the service. I will visit again."}
{"text":"It was good but not as good as I expected. 

Our server mentioned the specials but didn't tell us the cost of each special. We had to ask. Then we were told two prices for the same thing. Our baked potatoes were warm, not hot. Still good, but should have been hot. 

I was disappointed. Just expected more"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here since we moved to Medina 6 years ago and I have never been disappointed. The portions are huge and everything taste fresh and comes out hot. We recently went and I had the house sirloin (such a good cut and size for the price) with a side of grilled shrimp and everything was cooked perfectly. My husband had the rib eye with sautéed mushrooms and onions and there was plenty to share. I love the side salad that starts the meal, particularly because of their house Dijon Vinaigrette. They have a great wine list, and good martini's (particularly desert martini's). It's cozy and a great spot in medina for a romantic date night out!"}
{"text":"First time visit and food was great- not too many places actually serve REAL sea scallops.  The portion was huge- filet and scallop combo for $30?!  Great deal- would recommend highly!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. Holy crap the chicken cordon bleu was fantastic. I cannot believe this place is in Medina. We ate at one (and I assume the only other steak and seafood place in medina) called medina steak and seafood and it was way over priced for the portion you got but this place is not like that. Relatively pricy, I guess but the portions make up for it as does the taste!!!! Freaking fantastic!!!! I honestly could go on and on about this place. Great wine too!!! Go here before you go to medina seafood and steak. Trust me!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Had a NY strip and it was mouth watering good. 
The service was great..everything came out correct and in a timely manner even though they were packed!
Absolutely going back soon"}
{"text":"Agree with most of the reviews... Know that you will go there and the service will be underwhelming. Had a really bad experience with a rude owner/manager that acted as if he was doing us a favor to let us consider dining there. Finally got there Sunday with the family and must say the food was great. My wife and I are always seeking out good prime rib and this was the best we've had in years. Entire party enjoyed the food. Set your bar low on service sad to say, but they can cook a steak!"}
{"text":"Another fine meal.  Lobster Tails/Diver Scallops special and Fillet Mignon to die for.  Will be back yet again..."}
{"text":"Great service and a really nicely done Beef Wellington.  Excellent evening sitting on the patio.  Thank you Team Timber Lodge!"}
{"text":"We have dined at the Timber Lodge twice and both times the dinner and service were excellent. We came back the second time because of the warm, inviting and friendly atmosphere. Besides the roaring fireplace and friendly greeting, you will experience a truly wonderful meal. 

 Megan was our server and was extremely attentive and was knowledgeable regarding the menu, specials and anything else we desired.    She provided us with a wonderful evening.  It's easy to see that everyone in the restaurant was having a wonderful time.  The food was well prepared and served in a timely fashion. We had the cold crab cocktail - very nice to share, we also ordered a strip steak dinner which we shared and ordered an extra salad.  The entire dinner was enough for both of us and 2 more dinners the next day. We have yet to try the lobster and prime rib - I know they have to be good.  For those diners that miss the ambiance and charm of non-chain restaurant - this is the place to go.  We love this restaurant and don't mind driving from west Akron.

{"text":"The reason to go here is the prime rib. Don't worry there is other stuff on the menu, but you don't want the other stuff you want the prime rib. The service is top notch, drinks are cold and the sides are wonderful, but once again it's all about the prime rib. You could serve it out of a hotdog cart and it would get five stars."}
{"text":"By far, this place has the most customer-centered staff in any restaurant I have ever been to.  The food is amazing, high marks to the filet, carrot cake and generous cocktails!  We have planned two private parties there and had great success on both!  The wonderfully rustic setting makes all feel comfortable.  The Sunday brunch and special Bloody Mary's are a real draw. Owner Ron, Manager Lindsey, Chef Ray and all the wonderful people at the Lodge know how do it right!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal- took the family there- Great wine, great prime rib and Caesar salad with real anchovies !
Hope to go again !
Topped the night off with a big slice of carrot cake !"}
{"text":"Our favorite anniversary place. You are going to drop a wad of cash but the food is totally worth it. I ordered a steak and it was delicious. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I've only been on the bar side, but from what I can tell, it's the same menu only the attire is fancy. I had the spinach salad and the dressing on it was AMAZING! It was a warm bacon vinaigrette that had a garlic undertone to it. Oh my god so good. The salad itself was a little boring. Just spinach, hard boiled egg, onion, and feta cheese. It was also supposed to have mushrooms on it but I am not a fan. Some other vegetables or fruit could have livened it up a bit. 

The service was ok, but my mom was able to substitute chicken for shrimp on her salad without charge, which was nice. I will definitely be trying something else at this establishment soon!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious every time! I like the Fliet Mignon. My husband likes the prime rib. The ribs are tender, smoky and delicious!"}
{"text":"We have always loved this restaurant until yesterday, 06/26. The waitress was rather rude and snooty. My daughter ordered the \"jumbo shrimp\". It turned out that they were more medium size. My son and I both ordered the porterhouse steaks medium-rare. They both came out more medium to medium well. When my son showed the waitress she was less than apologetic. She almost criticized him and was snarky with him. She did get him a new steak but brought it out practically raw. This is not how a restaurant should treat customers. It will be a very long time before we go back, if we ever do."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  We've been here twice now and we had excellent meals both times. I had the fillet the first time and the prime rib the second.  They were both cooked to perfection. They have a great wine list and you can take the bottle home if you don't finish it with no corking fee! That's a great deal.  The staff is always very friendly and attentive. I will be back time and time again."}
{"text":"Had the Delmonico steak prepared medium. Much more fat than meat, but super tasty. Everyone enjoyed their meals. Prices are good. Would recommend. Decent wine and beer selection as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience for being out of state. The food was absolutely delicious! We were figuring there would be a wait considering it was 6pm on a Friday but we were immediately seated. Our waitress, Maria was absolutely fantastic! If you want an amazing waitress ask for Maria. Meals were cooked to absolute perfection, drinks were made perfectly, and we had a wonderful time. Did not feel rushed to finish our meals and leave. Maria is very personable, funny and makes sure everything is perfect for your meal. Hope to visit here again in the future!"}
{"text":"We went here 1st time in July to celebrate my birthday at 5:30pm weekday.  Our waitress was a snob who was geared only to sell wine (we don't drink).  My sister ordered a seafood dish, and I ordered the filet mignon between medium rare & rare (specifically).  The waitress argumentively replied \"We don't do that here\".  I told her \"well, you will in the end when I send it back\".  We were paying top dollar for dinner - she was dead wrong to treat us that way.  When our food came, she hurried away before I could check it.  We literally waited 20 minutes, trying to flag her down to return to our table to tell her to send it back and cook it longer.  We were ticked off big time.  In the end, my filet was cooked right.  I am not complaining about the food, I am complaining about our waitresses ATTITUDE.  We had the manager come over & told her what happened.  Her reply was \"Well, we have regular customers who frequent here that we make exceptions for re doneness of steak etc, but generally speaking we don't cook steak that way\".  We spent over $100 for a mean waitress.  We will not go back there."}
{"text":"Great place for a Great steak can't wait to bring my family when they come visit the server that we had Megan was the best will be requesting her every time we eat!!! love it !!!!"}
{"text":"Just OK for us. The lodge potato appetizer possibly the best potato appetizer I've ever had!  French onion soup very average. Waitress was great on the upselling side but not so much on the attentive side. Had to ask for drink refills more than once. Prime rib good / portion good. Lots of food for fair price so only 4 star for us this time."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Long wait but totally worth it. The grilled shrimp was phenomenal! The white wine flight was delish and well worth the price. Laura, our server, was so nice and professional, we'll ask for her next time!"}
{"text":"Steaks, Prime Rib, Pastas, and chicken are all good! Have eaten here many times and have to say its one of my favorites in medina.  Start out with thier featured wine (its always good) and then for an appetizer i recommend the crab and shrimp florentine stuffed mushrooms YUMMMMM!! They have a great selection of features for the weekend usually being an amazing fresh catch of the day.  YOU NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE OUT! I am confused on how there are bad reviews on here.. service is absolutley amazing they tend to the pace of your meal and are always attentitive. GREAT SERVICE GREAT FOOD GREAT ATMOSPHERE!"}
{"text":"My wife suggested we visit Timber Lodge recently for dinner and I didn't object because I usually pick where we dine. We called ahead and were told that we would have a 10 minute wait for a seat. We waited 15 minutes and were seated at a table. The restaurant is pretty old and it has some nice history. It's decorated like a hunting lodge with deer and moose heads on the walls. There are scenes of pine trees and flowing rivers painted on the walls.

Our server was friendly, detailed, and very attentive. She went over an extensive list of fresh items that were not on the menu. She also brought a bottle of wine to the table that they recommended. For once, I took two of her recommendations - the 21-day dry aged steak and a glass of that wine along with a salad. My wife ordered a chicken and rice dish.

Our salads were very tasty and the wine was excellent. A while later, our dinners were served. My dry aged steak was delicious! It was cooked medium, as requested. I also tasted some green beans, which were also very good. The asparagus was lacking seasoning, but it was cooked correctly. All meals are served with onion straws, which were tasty, but I didn't want to fill up on them.

The meal was a bit pricey, but it was very good and the service was excellent. We'll probably visit again."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars, but the restaurant was a great disappointment.
Next day after I checked out I talked with the Manager in the reception, just to let her know what was going on. She gave me a very unexpected discount. Make me feel better. I will definitively come back and give the restaurant another chance...otherwise I will continue to come back but eat somewhere else....

The rest of the staff was very attentive.

KUDOS manager."}
{"text":"Being from Texas it's hard to find good steaks anyplace else except very high end steakhouses. I was amazed at the quality of beef and taste.  I highly recommend the 12 oz. filet.  It was cooked great at medium rare.  I'll be back in town again soon, so save me some carrot cake.  Next time I'll save room for a slice."}
{"text":"One star only because a selection needs to be made. Beware! The service is slow and awful! Food poorly prepared 3 of 4 steaks at our table were severely over cooked, it was to late in the evening to return them as it took an hour after seating to get our order taken! To pricey for the lack luster service and quality of food, especially for a steak house! This is supposed to be what they are good at! Swing and a miss! Buyer beware..."}
{"text":"Stopped in once for dinner and would have probably only given the place 2 stars, but I gave it a second chance at brunch and they absolutely redeemed themselves! 

You just can't beat .99 cent bloody Mary's and the food is great! I've since tried a few of the omelettes and waffles! They're totally enjoyable and such a nice little brunch to enjoy with friends! I will say, I wanted the bacon waffle to be more impressive than it was, but all of the omelettes have redeemed it. 

Overall, I won't be back in for breakfast, but give brunch a try!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit having recently moved to live very close to Timber Lodge (last time we were here we drove an hour to get here). We we very pleased. My wife had crab legs and I ordered Delmonico ribeye. We shared calamari and New York style cheesecake.

I ordered my steak medium and it came out closer to well (brown throughout). The server whisked it away and had a replacement to me within minutes which was cooked just right. The crab legs were very large and amazing. Probably the best quality crab legs we've had in a long time. The (optional) anchovies on my Caesar were tasty!

Angie our server was very attentive and graciously held the courses until we finished each. It's nice not having a pile of salads, appetizers, and the main course piled around while you rush to eat it all while it's hot.

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"35 minute wait at 7 on a Friday. We sat at the bar and were served one drink in 35 minutes. The bartenders never checked on us or even closed our tab. We had to beg once they called us to be seated. But our waitress in the dining room was AMAZING. Her name is Sarah. The food was delicious and she knew so much about their wine. I got the oysters as an app, the full rack of ribs, and the MOST DELICIOUS bread pudding for dessert. It came to $52. The bloody mary's are $8.99!! But it's worth it to treat yourself."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night for my wife's birthday.  I ordered french onion soup, NY Strip steak with garlic butter and sauteed mushrooms, steamed broccoli, and a side salad.  My wife wanted to go here to get their Prime Rib.  

The french onion soup was very good.  The broth had a deep rich onion flavor with nice cooked pieces of onion.  The crock was topped with a couple croutons and melted cheese on top.  The side salad was also very good with shredded cheese, half hard boiled egg, croutons and dressing.  The broccoli was overcooked.  I prefer broccoli to be crisp tender.  The broccoli had a more mushy consistency.  The steak was ordered medium.  It was cooked medium rare.  The outside of the steak was medium while the very center was medium rare.  Sauteed mushrooms were perfectly cooked and the butter on top slid to one side of the steak and hardened.  It didn't melt.  The food besides being over or under cooked was still tasty.

Whitney was our server and she was very polished and knew her stuff.  She was able to rattle off the features and answer any of our questions with ease.  She kept our glasses full.  And kept the dinner moving at a perfect pace.  I'd highly recommend her.  She had help with bus boys and food runners.  When a food runner brought food to the table it was delivered auction style.  When my dinner came out it went to 3 different people at our table before it came to me.  That isn't Whitney's fault.  That was just the way they have service set up.

We sat at a corner table in the front of the restaurant along the windows near the front door to the restaurant.  There was cold air coming off the windows and every time the front door opened a gust of freezing cold 10 degree air blew into our table area.  I sat with my winter coat on at the dinner table the whole evening.  Unless someone at our table had a heavy sweater on they ended up with their coat on as well.  The restaurant itself has a northwoods log cabin rustic feel with stuffed animals on the walls.

Overall I'd give this place a 3.5 out of 5.  I rounded up to 4 since Yelp doesn't have half stars."}
{"text":"Our first time here. The service and food was outstanding!!! Kim and staff was awesome. Highly recommended and will be back. I have driven by this place a thousand times, so glad we decided to stop in!"}
{"text":"First, I must preface my review by saying that I visited with family on Father's Day and the place was extremely busy. That said, we had a large party (14) requiring multiple tables because the place really is not set up to accommodate more than 4 person parties except at one or two tables seating 6 or 8. Two in our party left because their booth was too far away from the group. Everyone else in the group enjoyed their meals, which are well prepared with fresh ingredients. Steaks here tend to be cooked to perfection and taste great. However, on this visit I ordered the daily special, which was an aged  Bone-in Kansas City strip and it wasn't that good. It was a lousy cut streaked with muscle. Cooked correctly, but it was tough, no flavor, 1/3rd of it was bone, and it was grossly overpriced at $42, which I didn't find out until after the fact. Speaking of overpriced, don't order from the \"kids\" menu. It's ridiculous. $15 for a simple burger with steak fries. $20 for ribs. Really?!? Kid friendly?? Ah...no. I would have given more stars if my food experience and the kid menu hadn't sucked, because I like the place. Atmosphere is nice, service decent, drink selection? is good, and the rest of the group enjoyed their meals. Maybe next time I'll enjoy it more."}
{"text":"My first experience here was fantastic. There were six of us dining and the food was excellent and it was impressive how the Staff stayed on top of everything despite it being really busy that night. Would definitely go back."}
