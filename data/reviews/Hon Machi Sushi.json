{"text":"Hon Machi may be the closest sushi place for us, but continues to disappoint. The sushi is just ok but it's the service which is really lacking. No or slow refills on water, have to ask several times for the check, and still wait a long time for the waitress to come back. The staff is friendly, but has no attention to detail. Sushi Room in Chandler may be a little more out of the way but worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have been here several times.  The staff is always very nice but they just don't seem to have enough wait staff.  Sometimes you are left with several dirty plates for long periods of time and it often takes quite some time to get drinks and your check.  The sushi is ok.  The Green Chili roll is excellent."}
{"text":"#1 Sushi place! I love the location, friendly staffs, good food, reasonable price. 

Recommended dishes;
King Kong roll
Lollipop roll
Dynamite roll
Las Vegas roll
Spider roll
Sashimi combo"}
{"text":"My first time eating there wasn't a good experience. I had to wait over an hour for my food and check. However, I decided to try the place again a year later. The place has improved. I was impressed with the food and service."}
{"text":"Ordered Mango and Avocado Salad and Aloha Rolls. The salad is a bit salty but overall is OK. Aloha Rolls are very nice. Will go there again for Sashimi Salad and other sushi."}
{"text":"They made us move tables when I wasn't ordering the gross deep fried stuff.  But since that gives them the biggest profit margin, they moved us and treated us like B class citizens when I refused to order that."}
{"text":"Food: Hon Machi Sushi has probably one of the best sushi in Phoenix/Chandler area. I mean it's amazing. I definitely recommend their Las Vegas, Hon Machi, Lollipop, and Jalope√±o Bomb. I want to go back and try their food (other than sushi). 

Price: They are not cheap, but I say you get what you pay for. You're paying for quality sushi. However, go during their happy hour (half price) or during their lunch specials. 

Service: Servers have always been friendly. Never had a complaint.

Ambience: Casual.

Parking: It shares a parking lot with other stores/shops, but it's never been difficult to find parking."}
{"text":"The Hot lava roll is amazing!! Their happy hour is great, I recommend the Honmachi roll as well. This family owned restaurant is always super friendly and welcoming. This is my neighborhood go-to for sushi, the patio is nice & relaxing when the weather permits. It does get busy, because the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I bought a Groupon for this place. He absolutely loved the spicy tuna roll... which says a lot because I don't hear him say that often!!!  :)  Cucumber rolls were pretty good but I didn't care for the veggie rolls.  It was a beautiful day out so we sat on the patio and really enjoyed our experience! The server was very friendly too!"}
{"text":"So 3 years since this review and I've been to a lot of good sushi places in Tempe, Scottsdale, North Phx, Glendale, and downtown...Hon Machi is my go to place in Chandler."}
{"text":"We love Honmachi!  We must come here at least every other week.  Since we are seekers of inexpensive and delicious places to frequent, Honmachi tops our list!  We always go during their happy hour which includes many rolls for half-off, provided you order at least 5 rolls.  There are many rolls to choose from the happy hour menu and we are always pleased with each one we try.  The Arizona roll is a constant favorite!  They will bring you a miso soup immediately after you order, which is great on those days we walk in so hungry!!  How often can two people have a great sushi dinner for less than $25?!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give this a 1.5 but since I can't I gave it a one.

The sushi was horrible.  I eat sushi a lot and so does my friend and we were so turned off by sushi after this experience that fish didn't look good for days.  People who say this is good sushi don't know what good sushi is.  Almost all of the rolls had cream cheese in them, which can be good but not in every single one.  Also the cream cheese in the rolls was huge- which overpowered all the other flavors.  

The service is horrible here as well.  My friend and I went together and while picking out sushi kept on being interrupted while we were obviously picking out sushi.  Once we had finally chosen our sushi choices a waitress could not be found.  We tried to make it very obvious but waited at least 10-15 minutes before having a waitress come get our slip.  When a waitress dropped off our sushi she plopped the plate on the table said \"here you go\" and left.  She didn't tell us which roll was which or where a missing roll was.  There was a lot of other stuff as well but I think it can all be summed up when my friend and I left and were trying to figure out who was our waitress and if we really had one.

If all the other sushi places in Arizona are not open then I would go back.  If there are any other sushi places open I suggest you go there before ever eating here."}
{"text":"This is my 10th time I went to this place and it's always great ! I went  there yesterday for All you can eat sushi ($19.95) on there beautiful patio ! We had such a great time and we were so full at the end ! Be back for sure !!"}
{"text":"$8.95 for two sushi rolls at lunch. Oh yes, delicious. The server also let me know that they have $25 all you can eat sushi rolls and appetizers on Mondays and Sundays... I will definitely be back for that!

P.S. The entry door is around the side, not on the front. Don't worry, they are open! :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I go usually after 9pm mon-thurs for their reverse happy hour. The sushi tastes fresh, and sushi chefs are friendly. The service may be lacking at times but my friends & I come here often and always have a great time."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place. Though during certain times of the day it does get busy and loud. If you go at 5pm it's usually quiet. Everyone there is always friendly and says hello upon walking in. The sushi is good and have many options."}
{"text":"Good food but bad service. First time we went there it took one of the rolls 40 minutes to come out after the other roll. Second time they told us it was happy hour so we ordered a couple happy hour rolls and then when the check came they said it wasn't happy hour. They apologized and said that one roll will be happy our price then charged our cards the non happy hour price."}
{"text":"Price was fair, but portions were smaller compared to other places. Quality was mediocre but edible, nothing outstanding. I would probably go somewhere else unless I was right in the area. Not horrible, not great."}
{"text":"This is easily the scariest sushi place I've been to. We ordered mussels as an appetizer but it came last (we had no problem waiting and the server never informed us it would take long). We had to swat away flies during the entire meal (which we didn't finish). The sushi was cut in huge uneven chunks so I asked if I'd could be cut into normal sized pieces. Although there was only one other table being served we waited and watched our newly cut sushi sit on the bar for 6 minutes  before I got up to get it myself. I gave this disgusting excuse for sushi two stars because neither of us got sick."}
{"text":"This place serves fantastic sushi. I've tried nearly ten different kinds at this point, and have always been delighted. It's rarely crowded, has lovely outdoor seating, and some of the best and friendliest waiters I've ever encountered. I wouldn't take more than about four or five people here as it isn't that big, but it's very well decorated and the many windows make it feel comfortably spacious. The sushi selection is quite wide, so it's easy to find something you're certain to like, and the appetizers are cheap and delicious. If they were in a more expensive location I'm sure they could charge much more, so enjoy the relatively cheap prices! If you become a regular you'll be recognized and extra-welcome, which is good since if you like sushi you'll end up going back often."}
{"text":"Why am I taking two stars off?
1- The fridge where they store fresh fish was dirty. It's located in the bar area and I can see how dirty one of their shelves was. It was a disgusting thing to see. (see attached photo)
2- I ordered green salad and I chewed an a sticker/label attached to a tomato. Made me wonder how good do they wash their vegetables. (see attached photo)
3- Their crab mix is smothered with mayonnaise. 
4- There were more than a couple of flys roaming the bar area, probably because it was next to a lake.
5- They only had one sushi chef so the service was slow.

I think all the above can be easily corrected. Hope they can address them because I really like the location and how cozy this restaurant is."}
{"text":"My stand-by sushi place.  Always fresh, and has pretty much all of the standard fare, plus a few unique rolls.  Also the calamari is not to be missed.  They rarely if ever have Toro though, not sure why that is.  Would rank as 5 stars, but service is sometimes a little slow.  Outdoor seating on the patio overlooking the water is nice on a cool night."}
{"text":"Good sushi, excellent lychee martini, and contrary to other reviewers, we had great service.  We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite sushi place in Chandler. Great prices for happy hour! Service is usually good and fast! Parking lot is usually packed but it's worth it."}
{"text":"They take reservations but apparently it's up to the manager to make sure your party has seating or not.  Worst service ever."}
{"text":"Not cheap, but very yummy! I love the view of the lake. Always good customer service and fast. We come here often since we live close by. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I like this place, have been here probably 4 or 5 times.  Great ambiance, not too busy when I was there, and could hold a conversation with date without having to shout.  The lake and coffee shop a few doors down are a good thing to hit up after eating.  I'm not even remotely an expert on what \"good\" sushi is, but I didn't have any issues with the food served here.  Good portion size, seemed freshly made, was tasty.  The miso soup is similar to what every other sushi place in the area serves but it's not bad.  I don't remember what the pricing was like, but that's probably an indicator it wasn't outrageous.

It's definitely worth visiting in you're in a mood for sushi."}
{"text":"Love this place! Green chili roll is amazing! Nice atmosphere to kick back and relax by the little lake!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but the food was terrible! Sushi did not taste like sushi! Crab puffs were burnt! Service was okay but was in and out within 15 minutes due to terrible food!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! This is my go-to spot when I have dinner with friends who are iffy about sushi. They LOVE it after they go here!! I have been going here for about 6 years now."}
{"text":"I checked out this places website prior to visiting not wanting to spend a ton on dinner that night. The prices seemed  reasonable for teppanyaki per the menu they have loaded on their website. Once we actually got there and sat down however we were given a completely different menu with entrees averaging around 18-20 dollars. They also charge around 2 dollars extra for fried rice. Food was fine but I felt a little deceived....Please update your website!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is not always perfect, but the sushi ALWAYS hits the spot and is good quality. I highly recommend coming either for lunch specials or during happy hour where you can fill up on delicious sushi, at an unbeatable price. 

The owner is so sweet, the staff is very friendly, and I think one of the sushi chefs has been around since I started coming here about 8 years ago. Sometimes they are slow about bringing your check and if they are really crowded the sushi can take a while since there is normally only one or two sushi chefs working, but I find both things totally excusable because the sushi and prices are so great."}
{"text":"Today I spent some good quality time at a hidden gem in Chandler...Chef Andrew was top notch, as well as the rest of the staff. I had some of the best Yellowtail there is..this place is the truth!!!..cheers to Hon Machi!!!..see you soon"}
{"text":"Freaking love this place Fish is top notch and presentations great they can fix the place up a little bit but I love this place I go there at least once a week"}
{"text":"When my sister told me about her favorite hang out/Sushi Bar in AZ, I was very skeptical!

Having had Sushi in LA, SF, Maine and several cities in Japan, I usually won't give a Sushi restaurant in AZ 5 stars!!!

The fish has to be very fresh, the sushi chef Japanese, the ambiance authentic, and the service superb for me to even consider 4 stars.

After several visits to this restaurant I can truly give them a Positive & Objective review.

Although I like traditional Sashimi dishes like Torro, I'm opening my pallet to the creative rolls like Dragon, Lolly Pop &  Las Vegas Rolls!

If you are a big Sushi fan like me you will definitely love this place..."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and went to Hon Machi with a bit of trepidation (and my Restaurant.com coupon in hand). It is in a strip mall, but, when nicer weather finally arrives, there is a lovely little patio out back. It overlooks a lake. Some of the twinkle lights are out, but maybe they'll get them fixed up.

I can see why some would complain about stacks of papers, etc. It IS like their home. But they also welcome regulars and are so sweet to children. That was nice to see.

Our main gripe was the godforesakenHEAT. It was like the air was broken. They had set up fans, but that isn't enough. After some time we acclimated and stopped sweating. Our other complaint is the oddly sticky wood tables. You know when they get cleaned but they still feel tacky? Yuck.

Our server (a young lady) was prompt when greeting us, refilling beverages, etc., and she kindly explained the details of the coupon to make sure we were clear on minimums and gratuity (we can read so we knew all that, but it was nice they made the effort).

On to the food! The starter garden salad was huge and included sliced avocado. It was delish! We both got one. We also got goyoza, which was just ok. I got a rainbow roll. I could smell a little eau de poisson, which always makes you wonder if your dinner will come up later (it didn't, I can report). My caterpillar roll, though, was incredible--not overly sweet with the eel sauce, just delicious.

Hubby got the tootie (not \"toostie\") roll, which was crunchy and amazing. We also got a baked roll that was a bit mushy. That could have been our fault ordering; we may just not be baked roll folks.

In the end, we thought it was a decent dinner, even with the heat."}
{"text":"Come here whenver I'm craving a bento box for lunch.  Btwn letting my dining companion order whatever they want (how nice am I?) and my 3 choice bento box (only $1 more than the 2 choice), there is plenty to share and variety.  Honestly I never order any sashimi/sushi here (not enough folks for me to trust turnover)...pork katsu, tempura (comes w/ 2 shrimp), and one of the rolls..."}
{"text":"Sushi was really good! However they lose a couple stars for cleanliness. They need a good cleaning/dusting of that place! I look up at the lantern above my head and its FULL of bugs and dust. Hopefully none of that dropped in my food!"}
{"text":"I took a group of colleagues from work for a social/get to know each other kind of outing. The atmosphere was good, the view of the lake is nice and the food was delicious. I had the medium sashimi plate and honestly I'm a little full, which is not normal for me with sashimi since there are no carbs. Everything was fresh and smelled good. The white fish was chewy but... that's kind of the way it is. Pieces were large and everyone went out satisfied. The service was a little lacking. It would have been nice if they were more attentive. To be fair we walked in as soon as the doors opened so there was probably some just opened work getting done. One of our rolls sat for quite a while before it was delivered. Not a big place but seating was adequate. I would definitely go back but it probably wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Decent sushi, not as good as Shimogamo. A less-hip Sushi Eye, perhaps?  Chairs are uncomfortable and the furnishings a little dated and tacky (literally - our table was sticky!).  Might be nice on a night when you can sit outside at the edge of the lake.  

We had a variety of rolls and Nigiri.  The surf clam was pretty gross (tasted fishy-I nearly gagged), but everything else was pretty solid.  Tempura and edamame (nice and warm) were really good, but it's hard to go wrong there.    Wait staff was nice enough, not overly attentive.  I had to ask a couple of times for more to drink.  Sushi chef had wild hair and no hat, which was a little disconcerting.  We were there until they turned off the music at 10:40 (they close at 10).

Might give them a try for lunch sometime, but no more surf clam for me!"}
{"text":"I was going to write a review about \"hey, maybe if you don't like waiting for cheap sushi, fuck off.\"

I've changed my mind.

Put in the order for sushi and an egg roll at 6:50. Got the food at 7:30. 

It wouldn't be such a big deal if you didn't see people who came in after you get their shit. I'm an only child and this the one time I've felt like a foster child taken into a home that just wanted me for government money. 

Here's the thing, I was all sorts of boozed up on the happy hour sake bomb at 7:30 when I asked for the check. Oop! Got a catch, I was soberly pissed off at 7:55 when I actually got the check. 

So, here's the deal. If you're in a time crunch, don't ever go. 

If you like cheap drinks, check it out. Decent sushi, cool specials.

Staff doesn't know how to handle more than 2 tables at one time."}
{"text":"Was going to go somewhere else for dinner but noticed a sushi sign. We decided to try it out. All you can eat for $19.95
Best deal ever. Sushi cam rout in a timely mannor, service was great. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Nice work! I'm so happy to see that this little gem stepped it up. From the new entry to new decor. Most of all, the sushi was superb AND so was the service!! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because there were fruit flies hovering by the bar as there were boxes of fruit behind it. Other than that, keep it up!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at some of the reviews of this place.  
The service was okay.  The drinks were a little slow, but the time on food was fine.  There were only about 5-6 tables of people at the time I was there.  

The food is mediocre, but not as bad as some of the other sushi bars in the area.  They make decent nigiri.  I didn't have any \"signature rolls\" or anything.  I had the agedashi tofu as well, it was pretty weak.

My biggest complaint was the cleanliness.  This is why I rated it as low as I did.  A sushi bar MUST be clean.  There was a big sticky ring right in the middle of the bar where I was sitting.  My allergies suck right now, but my wife said it smelled fishy.  The area behind the bar (and for some reason the ceiling above it) were far from spotless.  For me cleanliness is a deal breaker at a sushi bar so I will probably never return.

Of course the bathroom totally sucked as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for dinner on Saturday night. It was her birthday and she was eager to use a $25 Dollar Gift Certificate. We love Sushi and we hadn't tried \"Hon Machi Sushi\". The server was very nice and was very helpful which made it easy for us to overlook the \"extremely\" sticky table that had to be wiped down twice. We are not that type of people and I was very reluctant to ask, however, it was so bad that i looked around to see if there was a camera crew ready to jump out and laugh at us. My hand literally made a noise as I \"pealed' it from the table. 

With that said, I again, was pleased with the servers attempts to help. On with the evening... They displayed several types of Cold Saki and the one I DID want, which is a personal favorite, was really a Sample bottle for Display only. Ok, I can dig that... time to order... Sushimi and Rolls all came out at the same time... we never were served the appetizers we ordered so I very nicely cancelled them... along with the plate of shrimp tempura and rice plate that my wife ordered and never received... 

Ok, now, skip to the bill. We rendered the $25 gift certificate at the time of the order... basically, we had to order $45 worth to get the $25 off. We were then informed that the alcohol does not apply... ok... I can understand that , but in looking at the bill to order the \"5\" dollars in food to put us up... we discovered that they were charging us for the things they didn't serve us ??? The appetizers and the main dish that never arrived... Ok, now my \"keystone cops\" radar is alerting me... we reluctantly order about 15$ worth of food and wait for it to go... we get the bill and it's not correct and we lost the will to fight it... we were double charged for the main dish..!!!! we paid twice ...for something we never received. 

By the way, food quality was \"ok\". Service aside, I would not return for the Sushi... there are some fantastic Sushi Restraints within a stones throw that are much much better. Voting with my Checkbook, no thanks in the future... 

Don't fall for a 25$ certificate btw..."}
{"text":"Went here Friday night with some friends. We had the dragon roll, a king kong roll, and a crunchy spicy tuna roll. They were very good, especially the dragon roll, but that may be I'm partial to dragon rolls. The albacore was totally awesome, and I really liked the fresh water eel. Tried a few other sushi and all were good. 
They were moderately busy and service was nice and friendly, I got plenty of iced green tea. Overall we had a good time and plan to return to try one of the all you can eat sushi nights."}
{"text":"I eat sushi every chance I get coast-to-coast.

I love sushi like a ginger loves sunblock.

I've had some mind-blowing sushi in the past 15 years and I've had some that was as bad as the midget standing waist high to your girlfriend telling her that her hair smells nice.

The decor wasn't bad at all in the place, I liked it a bit except for the 2 giant plasma TVs on a golf channel. I hate that crap. Either go traditional sushi bar style or go Scottsdale style. People don't usually go to sushi bars to watch sports and it switches the focus away from the preparation on the sushi which is a great part of the experience in my opinion. 

Once the waitress served us I ordered some edamame, miso soup,and  the seared tuna tataki. The edamame was too soft, shriveled, and tasteless to eat. I sent it back because I could make better myself in a microwave from the frozen foods at Costco.The tataki is something I ALWAYS order at every sushi bar that has it. It's my fav dish if it's even done 1/2way right with fresh fish and the sauce is made well.

The Sake-bomber set ups came out but they didn't carry the mid grade cold sake I usually use for bombers so we got stuck with some hot sake that came out of a space bag box (The cheap crap)  I don't like doing bombers with hot, space-bag grade sake but I wasn't going to spend $40 on a bottle of good stuff for bombers and they lacked the option of a mid grade.

The tataki was cut too thick but this was to hide that the tuna was either old, hadn't been kept very cool, or been squashed. It was thick slices and it was just falling apart. Then there was the sauce. Bland and watery as any sauce I've ever had. Worst Tuna Tataki I've ever had and I've ordered that dish over 100 times in the past decade. We ordered a bunch of different rolls, some were interesting but nothing that I'd bother to type about.

The service was crap all night and there were only 4 tables with people in the whole place. Just a lack of caring.

We were all done with our food and had a enough beer left and almost enough sake to fill 1&3/4 of the 2 tiny shot glasses for the two of us to do 1 last sake bomb. I asked the guy if he could top it off (It was out of a plastic tube so it couldn't cost much!) and he laughed at me and blew me off.

I just spend $75 w/ everything at full price + tip in a 80% empty sushi bar with crap food and crap service and you can't come off less than a quarters worth of Sake so we can finish our last bomber? LAME."}
{"text":"The best sushi ever in town we tried multiple hands-down this is the best, excellent food excellent customer service ..."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi.   I was just grabbing a take-away order but I sat next two some regulars who seemed to have a great rapport with the sushi chefs."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant, and we came here on my mom's birthday! I feel terrible for letting this place put a damper on her special day.

Our server wasn't rude. She was scatterbrained and completely incompetent. I have no idea what she's doing in the service industry because she's clearly not cut out for it.

She didn't know the menu or happy hour specials at all. My dad actually had to walk outside with her to point out the advertised beer that he wanted. She spent lots of time at the hostess station doing nothing. Our waters stayed empty. When she checked up on us, we asked about one of the rolls we ordered. She just stared at us dumbfounded, and then presumably went to put it our order. However, the roll never came. When she checked on us again, we repeated the same process. I was getting very annoyed at this point. I went up to her at the hostess station and told her to cancel the order if it wasn't coming out soon. She said the chef was making it, but 10 minutes later, still no sushi. At this point, the hideously uncomfortable chairs were causing all of us to have back spasms. Now I know why people were sitting outside in August without fans or misters. The metal chairs out there were better in comparison.

Finally, I went up to her again at the hostess station and told her to ring me up right then and there so we could leave. She kept saying the roll was almost ready, but I wasn't going to be fooled twice.

Needless to say, this place is on our black list, and we'll be telling as many people as possible to avoid it."}
{"text":"I went on a scooter ride with a couple friends, and we decided to do a sampling of several sushi joints in the East Valley. Shimogamo was our first choice, but closed for lunch during the weekdays with the exception of Friday. So we did a quick Google search and found Hon Machi.

We entered the restaurant, and asked to sit on the patio. It sits on the lake and has a beautiful view. I think this restaurant could do a little more in the design part of their place; it's pretty old school sushi.

We ordered tuna, yellowtail, and salmon nigiri along with a crunchy spicy tuna roll, and eel nigiri for \"dessert\". Everything tasted great, and the fish was fresh with excellent texture.

This place also has a great mid-week happy hour. But don't be afraid to visit anytime because the food is an excellent value and cheaper than a lot of other places."}
{"text":"Food is really good! There are some unique rolls and huge portions. Prices are pretty standard and no happy hour on the weekends. Only thing that really sucked was the service- super slow when there were only two other couples in the place. Took forever to get waters, food, and our checks. Don't come here if you're in a hurry!!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite sushi place.  Very fresh, which is most important in a sushi resturant. Combats sushi I've had in japan. Owner Jackie is very sweet and always gives us a warm greeting. Service has always been horrible and slow, which made me glad, so this delicious sushi place would be kept my little secret. The last time I was in the service was quite a bit better. If you're a big sushi fan like me, great taste overrides waiting a while for your drink or check.
Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I really like the owner, Jackie. She is extremely friendly and outgoing, and she makes sure we always get the best sushi and service. The sushi is fresh and there is alot to choose from. Sometimes it may get really busy, but their staff tries to make sure our needs are met. I love how it has that 'mom and pop', small restaurant feel and there is a nice view. Since I am originally from the Bay Area, CA, I have a high expectation of sushi, and the food from here is practically the same thing. Love it."}
{"text":"Sushi and Cocktails is our favorite place to go. Right on the lake with a wonderful view and delicious food that is always served quickly. I like that we get in, enjoy our time, and get right out. We will always come back!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Hon Machi since about 2007. I don't go as often as I use to anymore; however, each time I come back, it's the same quality. 

There's usually one sushi chef working (two on occasion) so sometimes it takes a while longer for the food to come out. My last stop in was a pick up order so I did not get to see if that still holds true. It was a pretty slow night - I came in around 8pm on a Saturday and there were only a couple tables dining. 

Jackie is normally very friendly whenever I dine in with my family and compliments us with a free mochi ice cream dessert."}
{"text":"It's my new favorite local sushi place. Nice outdoor view and food is good. Friendly service and good happy hour."}

It's not about fusion this or that. It's about appreciating the chef and the quality of the food. 

The food is outstanding and the vibe is laid back. Definitely a local favorite."}
{"text":"Fell upon the all you can eat night so why not. 
Full service sushi bar and extensive cooked menu. 
Greeted nicely upon entering. Sat at bar. Two options for all you can eat. I went with the $19.95. 
Started with Sunomono. Excellent! Well flavored. Fresh. Now to the sushi choices. 
Tuna, Salmon, albacore, smelt roe about a dozen choices for the $19.95. Especially good Tuna, Salmon and Albacore. In fact doubled up. Smelt Roe was fresh. Not a huge fan of the Octopus. 
There are a dozen or so rolls to chose from and chef was more than willing to leave out an ingredient if you preferred. Golden Cali was my choice. Lots of masago on top of a crab mix. It was nice. Next time I'll come more hungry as there are a lot of choices. Service very good."}
{"text":"Ask for the boat!!  This place is great and every accommodating. Make sure to check it out for happy hour- best prices."}

{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years and my overall impresiion is that the sushi chef is burnt-out. He has been there the whole time and I will not go in if he is the one preparing the sushi. The manager is nice and seems to want to do a good job but that chef needs to go!"}
{"text":"Went in with a Groupon. The atmosphere was good and we were immediately seated. We ordered a few different items and were pleased by the presentation and the taste of the sushi.

Heres when it went wrong.... It took FOREVER to get the bill because they write everything out and add it up with a calculator. When I went to pay, I told her that I had a Groupon and she got really nasty! As she was re-calculating it for \"Groupon Prices\" she complained to us the whole time that we should have told her we had a Groupon.

WAIT! What's the deal with different pricing for Groupons?! Why would it be different pricing? This place is a rip off!

Oh - the best part? We all had food poisoning afterwards."}
{"text":"Had some sushi here a couple of weeks ago and it was quite good.  It was probably the best philly roll i have ever had with a huge chunk of fish, not alot of rice, and the perfect amount of seaweed.   it wasnt cheap, but it was reasonable for the amount of fish.  True, the service is slow, but our waitess was nice.  As long as the server is nice and respectful, I do not mind slow service."}

Meh. It was ok... but the fish wasn't as fresh as I wanted to see. 

Customer service was lacking and there were very few customers."}
{"text":"My favorite place for the past few years. We eat here at least once a week. They also make us custom hon Machi chips when asked."}
{"text":"I like the food, and the sushi chef is very hard working, friendly, and always gets our orders right.  Sometimes the wait staff is slow and doesn't check on us though, which is the main reason I only go there at night when I am not in a hurry."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times. The food is always fresh and good. Sometimes the service is a little slow. Happy hour is really good m-th until 7pm. Good for lunch, bento  box combos are a good deal. Nice outside padio."}
{"text":"Whenever we head to Chandler and are craving some sushi this is definitely one of our go to spots. The katsu here is delicious, always crispy and in large portions! Definitely enough for two people. The jalape√±o bombs are delicious as well. The lunch specials are awesome two rolls for cheap or even a bento box. The service lacks at times, so don't expect too attentive of staff. When Jackie (the owner) is there you can see she cares about her business. She makes sure all your needs are met, and makes sure her staff is on point. I also love that it's right next to the lake, if you sit on the patio sometimes the ducks will come up and say hi during your meal. Once, one even came into the restaurant by accident!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. The view out of the back window really made the experience good. (As well as the sake bombs haha) But I'm giving this 5 stars because the waitress was actually really good. Also the food was excellent. I've been eating sushi since I was about 10 years old and I've become somewhat of a connoisseur. I always have to try a sushi place if I haven't seen it before. This one is in the top tier. 10/10 would dine repeatedly."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I'm not a seafood fan, so I don't eat most sushi,
but I love the Green Chili rolls they serve here (probably not available in Japan!)  I come here a lot for happy hour, and enjoy the $5 Saki Bombers, as well as dining outside near the fake lake.  Always a great start to the evening..."}
{"text":"FYI - it's called Hon Machi, not Han Machi.  I'm surprised by the two other reviews-  portions are small?? Same size as Kona, RA, Sakana, sushi eye, etc.  It is always full from 5-7 for happy hour. The lunch special is $8.95 for two rolls and I get them to go all the time. The owner, Jackie, is awesome and always friendly and helps out when it gets busy for the other servers. The sushi  is fresh and delicious. I really like mom-and-pop places like this. It's nothing fancy but in the three years I've been going here it's always been great and never a disappointment.  My favorites are the Las Vegas roll and Hon Machi roll(both are on the happy hour special)."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi restaurant left in town. The owner is very sweet and will always stop eating her lunch to help out the staff when it picks up. Both the regular chefs and serving staff know us and each time we sit at the bar, even if we don't go for a month will ask if we want our usual. They're all so friendly and the fish is always, always fresh. Softest salmon I've ever found."}
{"text":"Hon Machi or Sushi & Cocktails? Well, whatever... \"sushi place by Sprouts\" is what we call it. This is my neighborhood sushi spot. This is the type of place you go for the fully cooked kind of sushi rolls (baked, tempura'd and the like). Not really for the fresh fish type of sushi.

I love their baked dynamite roll here. Not too many places make the sauce right. Here, it's pretty damn good and plentiful. Lots of scallops and krabs (yes, I'll admit I'm a fan of krab) with mushrooms smothered in dynamite sauce. Tempura Calamari is also good. It's lightly battered and seasoned with salt and pepper. Yummy! especially with tempura sauce. I also like their Dragon Rolls, Las Vegas Rolls and plenty of other rolls. Ooohh and the Lychee Martinis :)

I enjoy coming here every so often. It's clean. The staff is friendly. It's close to where I live. Parking is easy. & the cost is reasonable."}
{"text":"Tried the Las Vegas roll - found a new favorite! Love this place - great service, tasty fresh food at a good price."}
{"text":"Sushi is really good service sucks. So the first night it was busy they were short staffed we waited over an hour for some one to even check on us after we ordered. We waited 90 minutes to get 1 set of sushi and another 30 for the second set. Both were ordered at the same time. I didn't post a review because I thought it was just that they were short staffed and really busy. So my husband and I gave it a second chance. It was the same and still not as busy. We waited over an hour for food and no one ever came to give us a refill on our drinks. My drink was empty for over 45 minutes and not one of the staff including the owner  ever stopped. I had to track the server down to get a check. We will not be returning which is sad because the food is good but service is horrible."}
{"text":"The service was awesome and the selections are outstanding. The staff are friendly and they make you feel right at home. The owner is outstanding and checks to make sure everything is correct."}
{"text":"What the holy guacamole usually things like this don't bother me but believe there daughter was working here her shorts were so dang short you could possibly see her tonsils as my mom would say. I am trying to eat people... beer glass was broken glad didn't cut a lip. Sushi not so great.  Floor not so clean sure it has a lot to do with shorts girl wiping them down straight on to the floor. There is a bit of a smell when you walk in we almost walked  out .. (dang it) ac not working so good if working at all. Don't think I will be back.. omg bug in my water."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in our part of town. Walked in on a Saturday night, seated immediately and on the cute patio too! We had the mussels that were OUT OF THIS WORLD! I ordered misago w quail egg. Quail egg and misago were fresh and super tasty. The Honmachi chip was light, delicate but most of all delicious! I wished there were 4 instead of 3! We tried a new one tonight, the chimichanga roll. We were wow'ed! A nice roll and no rice! Saw all you can't eat on Sunday/Monday. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"I've been to Han MAchi a handful of times and decided to have my birthday party of 15 there. I made the reservation at 11am the day of, providing my contact information at their request.

Upon arrival, the restaurant was busier than i had ever seen it and there were no tables available. My party waited in the lobby for 30 minutes after my reservation time before some guests became restless and started to leave. The staff scrambled to ask other guests to move to other tables and cram us into what tables they could scoot together.

There was one overwhelmed waitress trying to serve the entire table. Dishes all came out at different times. One guest was served an hour and a half before others. They even brought out some mochi with a birthday candle in it for me before i received all my dinner.

Many guests canceled their orders after waiting for two hours. They did not apologize or offer to erase any items from the bill to compensate."}
{"text":"i love this place!
HAPPY HOUR  LOVE IT !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices M-Thu for sushi, appetizers and sake bombs. We always enjoy the satellite radio station bumpin' Old Skool R&B and new Justin Timberlake, wouldn't be the same without that ambiance.  The sushi is always satisfactory and tasty, never had a problem with it before.
If going within the final hour of happy hour, beware you might have to wait for a table.  And any time you visit beware of a wait as they seem understaffed and kind of slow. But overall a great little spot we can walk to - so 5 stars for that!"}
{"text":"This might be my favorite sushi place. Beautiful setting on the lake -- pleasant servers that all attend to you not just one person. Fresh and delicious sushi: presentation awesome. Not inexpensive but worth it. Parking was a nag. I returned again last night, and it was again the most wonderful sushi. Begin parking lot was busy, but I guess that's what you get for great sushi. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I was VERY skeptical about this place but my brother insisted its good.  First thing I noticed is that it was located by a man made lake.  That is pretty cool except in the summer, the lake will attract bugs. So don't sit outside in the summer. Even at night.

We had ordered a variety of sushi, some on happy hour and few that were not.  Our order consisted of Spicy Tuna, Las Vegas, California rolls as well as a couple Sashimi items like Yellowtail, Salmon, and Ebi.  Everything was good.  The only thing I did not eat was the Las vegas roll, but my brother said it was just okay.  

Service was good.  She was not the friendliest server, but she was efficient and we never had to wait for refills on drinks or wait long for the bill.

I would grade them a B-"}
{"text":"Hon Machi is delicious!  It's my favorite Sushi place in the Chandler area.  I highly recommend the sashimi salad, the king kong roll, and the aloha roll. Great, tasty place."}
{"text":"Love their sushi but wow, service can be slow and disorganized. I've gone 6 times, average dinner time takes about 1 hr with 20 minutes of eating. Sushi rolls come out one at a time and fairly slow. See http://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-kee-tempe#hrid:hRO30ARaKzuPU9nuyvLnRg/src:self 
I haven't been back to Hon Machi since."}
{"text":"BUGS!! Do not eat here. Check photo posted. Dirty dishes everywhere. Bugs in the eating area. Can you imagine the rotting food in the back? Bugs in a sushi  (raw)place is dangerous!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. $8.99 for two rolls and they tasted amazing. This is favorite sushi place in AZ. Highly recommend eating here. The staff is fun and friendly too."}
{"text":"Worth another visit for something different. 3 stars for now! I didn't care for the dragon roll..too much sauce and I wasnt impressed by the imitation crab meat. I hear this spot has a great happy hour though!"}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend yesterday. The staff was really friendly and the sushi was fantastic. It didn't take long to get our order either. It was our first time having hand rolls and they were really tasty and filling, which I find sushi usually isn't all too filling. I would definitely recommend the Rock N' Roll. It wasn't on the order sheet so you have to write it in, but it was great and instead of being wrapped in rice it was wrapped in cucumber. It made it difficult to pick up with chopsticks, but it was delicious and creative.
Also they have a really nice back patio, and though it was raining outside and we didn't get to sit on it the view was really nice. There are some apartments with a man made lake in them and it is not everyday in Arizona that you get to eat with the view of a lake. Not to mention I would certainly consider it affordable, happy hour or not."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was terrible. What kind of sushi restaurant serves sushi without wasabi? Let's just say this place is far from authentic!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. When you walked in one side of the restaurant was like someone's house, complete with high chair and papers stacked up. Food was good, but the service was bad. We waited, and waited, and waited some more. Our waitress wasn't very friendly and ignored us. We had to hunt her down a few times. When I asked to speak to the manager, the manager only apologized and told me I shouldn't leave a tip. That's not good business. I despise  this kind of service. Will never go there again. There are so many other options."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour and got just items from the happy hour menu, OMG I am beyond full. For just under $20 we got three different kinds of sushi rolls, goyza, cucumber salad, and a chicken side. This place is awesome, plus a view, feed two people for $20."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi place.  I'm so glad we tried this.  The sushi is so fresh, it's prepared right in front of you if you sit at the bar. The staff is so friendly.  I've been to a lot of sushi places and this place is amazing. I can't convey how fresh and clean the fish was. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here for HH!  Pretty sweet deals on some of the sushi rolls.  I really liked the spicy salmon roll, the fish tasted fresh.  Sake Bombers = $5 , very good deal!  You get a large bottle of beer along with a small sake bottle. Nice view of the pond also.  Would have to come back again to try the other sushi rolls at regular hours!"}
{"text":"Very delicious sushi with decent pricing for happy hour. The regular prices weren't too terrible, but having to get full rolls it isn't bad. 

You may have to wait a while to be served but the waitress we had was very nice and explained a few things for us. 

The view is calming since you can sit next to the large windows looking out to the lake. When it is nicer weather I would most likely try sitting on the patio. 

It was not loud at all in there and would be a perfect small spot for a date. Would come back any time."}
{"text":"Very good sushi! I think I have found a sushi place to frequent regularly now! Everything was very fresh and creative. It seems if you like spicy sushi, this may be a place for you, but don't worry it's not all spicy, they just have some great things to try that are spicy. The sushi chef at the bar was friendly too! This place is in walking distance of my place so I am definitely going to try their 5-7pm happy hour soon. It is located right on lakeside property so you can also have a romantic dinner outside overlooking the lake, but probably want to save that for this fall :)"}
{"text":"When one hears the word sushi they might think \"Ew dead fish\" but when prepared at Han Machi sushi becomes an amazing meal. On hot summer days I enjoying going into Han Machi and enjoying their refreshing assortment of sushi. It is prepared well and with beautiful presentation whether at the fun sushi bar or in the dining area. The restaraunt is rarely busy and the service is always great. My water has yet to run dry and the \"on the house Mizo soup\" is to die for! I definitely recommend the California rolls and if you are feeling a bit more adventurous, the Shrimp Tempura. You will surely be satisfied. 
 I have yet to try any other cuisine at Han Machi but the Teppanyaki looks delicious and entertaining. The master chefs fling and fly savory foods at the guest in a fun and safe way. As i enjoy my sushi i also enjoy the show. At Han Machi it is a simple chill enviroment for family and friends to enjoy a delicious and exotic meal. 
Prices at Han Machi are very reasonable. I often go on Mondays thru Thursday where the sushi is half price for 5 rolls and up. You can get a California roll for only 2.50 a roll, it should almost be considered theft. There is also \"all you can eat sushi\" on sundays from 4-9 which i have not experienced but will sure to soon. Definitely two thumbs up to the people and food of Han Machi."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, our chef has a great sense of humor, and service was fast and kind. Went for Valentine's Day and couldn't be more please!"}
{"text":"We just love that place! The location is very nice, right on the water. We come here during Happy Hour. Usually, sushis are very expensive, however the deals on happy hour are just awesome! $3.75 for a Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll! Plus they are very good and tasty. 
We love to sit outside and enjoy the view, we recommend that place to our friends and they always love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and good area by lake.
Just need to work on good service and dependable people serving customers. Servers are slow and require owner presence to follow thru with orders and good service. Please play Japanese music sometimes since you are serving Japanese food. The staff including Sushi chef can all use a little hospitality and friendly training from the owner. Everyone should smile rather than staring at you when waiting to be seated. I don't mind spending the money but please earn it, I shouldn't have to get up and go get napkins, chop sticks and water myself because I got tired of waiting. 

That's all, I hope it helps it's just my opinion based on my experience."}
{"text":"I brought my family of four with me for an all you can eat sushi dinner. The kids were well treated and the sushi was ridiculously good. They even cut up an orange for one of my kids. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for sushi. The sashimi salad is so good and frankly it has ruined me.  I compare all others sushi spots to it and they just don't stack up.   Tons of sushi on it and it has a delicious dressing. 

The restaurant has been recently upgraded and with a cover back patio overlooking the lake.  Very nice outside especially this time of year. 

The staff and owner are very friendly and personable as well.  

Check out this amazing little spot!"}
{"text":"We went on a weekday for happy hour. Got a bunch of things, and didn't give much. I don't know if it was the happy hour sushi, maybe they cut on quality, but we ordered six different things and except the spicy tuna, all had the same flavor. A lot of cream cheese and deep fried stuff in most dishes. Appetizers came after two sushi plates, so they are not considered to be appetizers any more. Really slow service. Nice patio option though. I wouldn't say that I won't go because the poke bowl seemed famous ($12), and maybe next time we'll just stay at the bar for happy hour. Beer prices are good too."}
{"text":"If u want fresh sashimi?  if u want yummy sushi? dont miss here ? i like here so far? everytime i been here i got everything i want? whatever the servese food drink ? i like it? TRust me?"}
{"text":"Great Patio and relaxing place to have lunch.  I ordered the Sashimi lunch special which consisted of tuna, albacore and salmon.  The pieces were sliced proportionately, nicely placed on the plate and delivered in a timely manner.  If you are considering cooked dishes, the Shrimp and Vegetable Udon noodle is plentiful and the broth was seasoned to perfection."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The waitress was super friendly.  The patio seating was ideal with a beautiful evening patio view.  But when it really comes down to it, the food and drinks were the main reason my friend and I visited the place.  We decided to start off with some sake bombers, a Vegas roll and some freshwater eel.  Then, everything turned sour...
*  It took about 30 minutes to get our food, which seemed a bit long considering there were not many other diners.  Thankfully, we had good conversation going while we waited. 
*  They were out of Sapporo beer (my fave with sake).  
*  Our Vegas roll was soooo greasy, I forced myself to have 2 pieces (thinking it was maybe just the first one). We noticed the plate had a pool of oil/grease where the pieces we had eaten had been placed.  We couldn't even eat the freshwater eel or the remainder of the Vegas roll because we were so grossed out.  We simply drank the remainder of our drinks, paid our bill, left a tip (the waitress was very nice and it wasn't her fault the food was so horrible, right?) and left to another bar/restaurant hoping it would redeem our wasted money/time the beginning part of the night.  I did mention we did NOT want to finish our sushi because it was so greasy.  The waitress simply apologized and took the food away.  I kind of felt something more on the behalf of the restaurant should have happened?  But maybe that's just me and what I would have done.

We will NOT be coming back and are in search of a local sushi restaurant that is up to par.  Will let you know if/when we find one! :)"}
{"text":"By no means is this the best sushi you will ever have in your life. What it is, is reasonably priced, fairly quick, and pretty good overall. My friend LOVED his squid salad and I really enjoyed my yellow tail tuna and shrimp tempura rolls. They have great happy hour and lunch specials so make sure you go during one of these times for the best deal. They also have a patio overlooking the water so be sure to check that out."}
{"text":"Never going back!
We went here with one of those restaurant.com coupons ($10 off $20).  First, the service was non-exisitent. The waitress ignored us the entire time minus when she dropped off the food.  Our meals were not even done at the same time. Half of my boyfriend's order arrived and by the time he was done with it mine arrived. When I was done, the second half of his meal arrived.  The sushi itself wasn't bad.  I did however not like the fact that my teriyaki salmon was burnt black and very overcooked.  
They took the food and we literally waited 20 minutes trying to get the waitress's attention for our bill. She took the coupon and gave me back a bill that originally said $49.99 and the final after coupon was $35.00 including an 18% tip. WTF?
Breakdown:
salmon - $15.00
crunch roll - $6
las vegas roll - happy hour $4.5
chicken yakitori - happy hour $4
2 waters - free
Total = about $30
We should have been out of there about $20 after coupon.  I was so sick of being there that I just paid and left.  BTW, according to restaurant.com, they never even activated the coupon.  Save your money and go to Cafe Wasabe in Tempe."}
{"text":"Great Sushi! We also love the tempura veggies. Perfectly battered. A nice choice of sakis too. Such a nice little patio sitting right on the lake."}
{"text":"This is my favorite next door sushi place since coming to Chandler. Their rolls are delicious! The main sushi guy is always friendly and personable. Also go during happy hour too! You cannot beat their prices"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is great! Why the 3 stars? The service is SLOW. We came on a Friday night, we were 1 of 3 tables inside( plus maybe 3 outside). The time it took to bring us menus when we were sat, to the time we were checked on and orders taken, and so on... all took too long. The service was friendly, just could have moved at a faster pace. On the positive side, the food came out in a timely manner, and did taste very good. I'll come again, the food is worth another shot. Maybe we'll have a better experience."}
{"text":"MY favorite place to eat for sure! Ive been here about 7 times with my boyfriend now. always have good service! the sushi bar and the all you can eat sushi is amazing! They let you order no matter how many shush rolls you want with out limitations. Sushi has always been fresh and fast. love this place!"}
{"text":"We walked into this restaurant and noticed it had a strange smell.  My husband thought it smelled like a fish market, which is a tad better than my first thought, that it smelled kind of sewer-like.  Maybe it was due to the location of the restaurant, since it is right next to the man-made lake in Chandler.  Undaunted by our olfactory caution though, we headed in with a mission to use our Groupon and gorge on sushi.

Hon Machi itself serves up OK sushi, nothing too spectacular, although they do have an interesting selection of rolls to choose from.  Go here to get cheap sushi and appetizers, especially during happy hour, or to pig out on all you can eat sushi on Sunday and Monday nights (~$20 per person, limited selection).  We decided to go a-la-carte, and got a few rolls, and hamachi collar as an appetizer.

The timing was a bit off, since we got our more basic rolls first, while our appetizer actually came out with the 2nd set of rolls we had ordered.  I've never tried hamachi/yellowtail collar before, so I can't really gauge its quality compared to other restaurants, but here the fish was tender with good flavor.  

The rolls themselves were just OK.  We got a selection of spicy salmon, spicy tuna tempura, and soft shell crab.  My favorite was the soft shell crab, and the least favorite was the tuna tempura because the rice ended up tasting gummy and mushy.  

Service was good.  Our waitress was very attentive and constantly filled our iced teas as needed.

I'll definitely be stopping by here again to try out more sushi.  Hopefully it'll smell better next time I'm here!"}
{"text":"I was craving sushi for my 20th birthday and my cousin recommended this place for us. Half of my party ended up at the other location 5 miles down the road so make sure to clarify which one you are going to with your friends, haha. :)

The food wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either. Average sushi for around the price of $8-$12. Not all of the sushi comes with 8 pieces so make sure you ask if they do because otherwise it's not worth it for the price. 

Service was nice! My cousin asked if we could have our sushi delivered in a boat since it was my birthday for a special occasion and they said sure. Overall 4/5."}
{"text":"The sushi is awesome & happy hour is on point! If your craving sushi and beer at a great price come here! A+ service!"}
{"text":"Spicy salmon roll was best I have ever had. The service was extremely slow and she forgot a few things. Prices are decent. If you have an extended lunch hour, check them out."}
{"text":"Any concerns about the speed of service should be tossed aside. My family went on a Saturday night and quickly were served the best calamari I ever have eaten, outstanding rolls and melt-in-your-mouth sashimi. Our server was outstanding, and a duck even walked over from the lake to say hello (and bit my finger).

My mom, who is allergic to avocados and let the server know it, was given a roll with (you guessed it) avocado in it. But she loves Hon Machi so much she forgave the chef."}
{"text":"I've been here two times. Once on a Sunday afternoon with my husband (all you can eat sushi) and once alone on a weekday during Happy Hour. When I came alone for a quick dinner, it was packed. I was surprised that my rolls came out within 5 minutes. The happy hour prices are phenominal. One of my all time favorite rolls is the Las Vegas Roll, and anywhere you go, that's always one that's in the higher price range, anywhere from $9-12. It was $4.50 during Happy Hour! Woohoo! I got 2 rolls for $8.50!! I'm definitely a fan and the sushi is delicious :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to this sushi bar since 2005. They do not always have the quickest service, but their happy hour menu is great and the sushi is always good! 

Sitting on the patio is wonderful since they are right next to a lake - but you may often be forgotten by your server. The music is obnoxiously rappy and not relaxing, which is why I often opt for the patio in the cool weather.

I have sometimes waited over an hour for my check, even after asking for it several times. They go through waiters often, and the lack of attentiveness is frustrating. For as long as I have been going to this restaurant, not a single person knows me there. If it weren't for the sushi, I would not return to this location."}
{"text":"Over-charged during happy hour. They said their prices had increased from what they said on the menu. We said no one told us, they said too bad. Extremely unfriendly. Felt taken advantage of/discriminated against. We were the only customers there until leaving. Avoid."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, we are much bigger fans of the the Hon Machi on Alma School.  The service was horrible and the food was sub par."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I've been to this restaurant more than once.  My last experience is how I decided to give it a 2-star, maybe I would have given them a 3-star based on prior visits. (At first I was tempted to give it a 1-star but I reserve that rating for visible creepy crawlers, etc.)

630 - We arrive to make sure we are in time for Happy Hour. 
645 - Our order was taken 
653 - Edamame and salad arrive (no utensils, napkins, water or beer).  The lower into the bowl of Edamame we get, the less fresh they taste. 
655 - Napkins and utensils arrive.  We ask about our beer and water (it's Happy Hour, remember?!)
658 - Water arrives, Happy Hour is over so they take away the menu.
702 - Beer arrives (Where are their priorities?)

Then sushi arrives and it's mediocre or even worse than mediocre.  Maybe I should say, you get what you pay for?

Definitely not going back here."}
{"text":"My favorite crab puffs I have ever had. They are always piping hot and have lots of crab whereas many places the cream cheese is the only thing you can taste. The patio is lovely when the weather is nice. This is a smaller place and depending on how many people are working and dining you might have to be a little bit more patient than at a larger chain. But it is worth it"}
{"text":"the night started with a resturaunt next door. The three of us eyed this place as we walked next door for dinner. We were sat down, but after 15 minutes of Sitting and no one even taking our drink orders, we walk out to try Honmachi. The atmosphere was nice, and the place wasnt too busy. We order 6 different rolls and ALL were amazing. This is by far one of the best sushi joints i have tasted.  The sushi was very fresh, and definately made to order. The first bite was nothing like any sushi i have had before. It was a burst of flavor, yet subtle. It was simply amazing! The happy hour specials make this place even better! Going back again this week! It is so hard to find good sushi, and this is now my go to place!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst sushi in Chandler. I have eaten here twice, felt quesy both times after. I ordered chirashi and the food was not fresh or authentic. Stay away, I know good sushi is hard to find in Chandler but even if you are desperate, don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Nice.

We hadn't done a sushi place in a while, so when my wife and I were out, and the question came up as to where we were going to eat that night, the fact that there was a sushi place right where we were at the time essentially answered the question for us.

But how was the food?  Quite good!  I'm not much of a sushi kind of guy, but I'm all for a good beef teriyaki on a bed of rice--thankfully, that's what they have here.  As for my wife, she's a lot more into raw fish, and Hon Machi did a tasty job there too.

Not too expensive, not too fancy, just good Japanese cuisine in a friendly atmosphere.  I can't let that much time go by between eating Japanese food again.  Now, I know a good spot to go to. . ."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for midweek happy hour. We got 3 appetizers and 5 rolls for $30. Service is a bit lacking during a big rush, but still very polite."}
{"text":"This is a good place if your feeling lazy don't feel like cooking. Quick bite, nothing fancy at all just typical things you'll find at a sushi bar. The people don't seem happy but they are ok, good prices. I usually come here with my kid after a workout. Pic posted is Jalape√±o popper tool but not deep fried, Delish!"}
{"text":"Great little sushi place nestled by the lakes. They have a good selection of lunch special. We had the 2 rolls for $8.95 plus the whitetail and snapper nirgri.  The snapper was very buttery and silky. 

We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the chef prepare our sushi. The service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Greatest when I walked in. Service helped me with the menu. Ordered a cucumber and a veggie roll. Both were fresh and good. If you like sushi check them out. They have indoor and outdoor seating. I order carry out and the rolls did not make it home. Check'm out check' out!

Peace"}
{"text":"If it's wasn't for the great sushi I wouldn't come back. The service has gone to crap here. The girls are awful, no one knows what they are doing they have not respect or courtesy. It's always a disaster of 3 servers running around confused. Not sure if they are having problems staffing see there is always a hiring servers sign outside. One of the girls literally stomps and runs everywhere and the chef has to come out to greet people. It's bad but the sushi is the best."}
{"text":"My kids always have a fun time at the tepan grill! The chefs are so comical and the food is amazing! I really enjoy taking the family out to Hon Machi for a fun filled night."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this spot for years now. Every time I learn about a great new sushi spot, I go check it out. Invariably, I wind up back here though. Quite simply, there is no better sushi in the area, either in flavor or in value. The portion sizes are generous but not large. The prices are typical for sushi, but do not get frisky with $20 specialty rolls. Unlike many places, I can order a custom roll and it is not an issue. The sushi chefs enjoy being asked to get creative. The non-sushi menu has enough variety to please just about anyone.

The drink selection from the bar is somewhat likited, but includes anything one would expect in such a place. The sake selection is great. 

Lunch specials are fantastic and can hardly be beat.

The place has a winning happy hour. A person can eat dinner and walk away with a buzz if they want for under $25 (after tip) if they stick to happy hour.

The view over the lake is nice and people watching there can be a hoot."}
{"text":"Came in hoping to find a new sushi spot and definitely did not. The place smelled like a bathroom. Servers were in the middle of shift change and didn't know we were not being helped. Table and menu were extremely sticky. We asked to be moved outside and were refused. Music was played from radio and really unsuitable for sushi place. A couple bugs crawled on the table while we were eating the sushi and my girlfriend got a bit freaked out. The only saving grace was that the sushi was pretty tasty for the price, but needless to say, I'd rather  eat at RA. If you're looking for a good sushi place, try Stingray or, in the area, Sushi Eye or Mido (for cheap and quality). Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is really good and friendly. If you like sushi get the Las Vegas roll and hon macho roll. My gf is really picky and she ordered the chicken fried rice and she loved it. The price is high which is normal for sushi but it's well worth it here. The parking sucks because of all the restaurants nearby. The setting is really cute and there is outside seating by the lake which is really nice."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place, specially on happy hour. Try the jelapenio bombs off sushi hour and the jelapeno pops on sushi hour. Eat on the lake too!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, been here quite a few times, had sushi, poke, yakisoba, calamari..

Consistently great food, and the staff are very friendly.. Plenty more of tvs to catch any sports action and great patio overlooking the lake (lol)..

Now, the biggest reason this just became one of my goto places, is the hospitality and the Calamari.. One my top 5 calamari places now.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"I come here often.  The food is FANTASTIC, the happy hour specials are great, the all-you-can-eat deal on Sunday and Monday is wonderful, the atmosphere is comfortable, and there's outdoor seating by a lake (ducks included).  If you want to watch the game while you eat, there are a couple of TVs at the bar, but the TVs don't dominate the room and won't interfere with your dinner if you prefer to dine at a table and not watch the game.  I recommend the Las Vegas roll, Hon Machi roll, Golden California, Hawaiian, Lemon, sake and kani nigiri...I've probably had half the things on the menu, and haven't had one i didn't like.  The dragon lemonade is delicious, and the iced green tea goes really well with nigiri sushi in particular, and their house chardonnay is nice and dry.  The staff is always very friendly.  One of my favorite places to eat ever!"}
{"text":"A good friend of mine swears by this place, so I have tried it out on 2 occasions now. This review combines the 2 experiences I have had here. First off, the atmosphere is drab. Maybe it's me.. and this may seem snobby to you, but the appearance and decor at a sushi joint really means a lot in my book. I love a sleek setting with the right lighting for sushi. It adds to the experience. Hon Machi looks dated. The odor when entering was not appetizing, and on the second visit during the day, I did notice some small flies inside the restaurant. On trip #1 (a Friday night), we sat at a table. The place was dead, but service was still very slow. The food wasn't terrible, but nowhere near what some of my preferred places do. Maybe they had an off night, so I gave it another shot here recently. Trip #2 sealed the deal for me. The rolls were all falling apart. Nothing seemed fresh. The owner even apologized to us for how bad the sushi was as she delivered it to us from the chef's station. Crazy right?. Flies, stank, slow service, and sub par sushi.. Truly a disappointment-"}
{"text":"I honestly love to give good reviews. with that said... Rude, wrong, and incompetent. no food , but the one table ordering it just looked like mounds of rice. (I don't do rice)

I would give this 0 stars if possible. I  went the the web site because I purchashed a group on. I want to say i  purchase these groupons because I love good sushi,and spend a lot of money on sushi monthly. so finding new places with different chefs is always a wonderful adventure. I have found my favorite sushi bar through groupon, what a great option.  as I tour the web site for Hon machi sushi, on a Saturday afternoon it says ¬®closing soon¬® it is about an 18 minute drive, and they closed at 2:30 according to the web site. It was 1pm, so I said to my 7 year old, lets go, We jumped in the car and drove across town, to find a CLOSED restaraunt, It looked like a slum, pictures drawn like cartoons huge across the front and a sign that said 2 rolls lunch special 8.99.  I was frustrated that they were closed that there own website said open!  I  relaxed and We went to Sakana sushi, luckily they were open and took care of us, we spent about 60.00 with the tip and everything was devine, my 7 year old orders an expensive cattapillar roll and I order everything from sashimi to nigri to hand rolls no specials for me. I am a real sushi fan. no cooked stuff either.  I can spend that much alone for dinner easy peasy.  the chefs all know me, and my daughter for the past 5 years.  service always good, and variety of fish and fresh always! yesterday i walk in to this Hon machi that looks awful the door is open, and there is no parking so my spirits rise.  I am disabled and have to walk across the parking lot litterally, I expect to see a full  sushi bar, it was empty!!!! they refuse my groupon immediatly (waitress) she says Oh no not for lunch. i said I am not going to order lunch, she says nope u have to come back, well as u know i am disabled and i have already driven to this dive before. I explain I am ordering dinner not lunch,  she refuses and rolls her eyes.  I sit at the empty bar and call group on, who tells me , it says nothing on the groupon that they won't accept it for lunch so I get a full refund. I said nicely Put it on my account, it isn't your fault  they are  incompitent.  they must be laundering money, the place looked dity all the way to the picture of the cat hanging crooked on the wall.  I drove once again to Sakan sushi and again it was perfection! I  never got service the  place is a dump and the people are rude , and they are not open when the website says 0 stars right?  yup . I  still have anther groupon  for sushi and  i am going to try, but I likley won't be back sakana is my place. I did find sushi Ave, friendly  decent sushi, and they don't close for lunch. in my area so  I will go there oor sakana no way will I ever purchse a groupon for a dive  again. iknow whats good and I won't suject mself to  the bologna again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere nod excellent service! The sushi is great! They have a gorgeous outside patio as well as a cozy inside. We were immediately greeted and seated. Our food was promptly brought to us even though it was busy. We never once felt the service dwindle due to the high volume of people. Prices are consistent with other sushi locations in the area... Yet the quality is outstanding. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Looks can really be deceiving...

I found this place and wanted to try it out because they seemed like they have REALLY good specials and the pictures looked good. During happy hour a majority of their rolls are 50% off. We ordered the Philly roll, salmon sashimi roll, vegas roll, & I think it was the crunch roll. Everything was mediocre especially for the price that you're paying. 

The worst parts? We sat at the sushi bar and there were gnats flying around. No lie! How horrible is that!? 2nd? Customer service was terrible. After we were seated and got our order placed we never saw our waitress again. My friend had to ask for her glass of water maybe 4 times. When someone finally brought it, it wasn't even our waitress but a different one. They never once came by to see how everything was or if we needed anything. 

They have good specials and it's very close to my house but I definitely won't be coming back with that type of service."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 2 1/2 stars out of 5, but it was either 2 or 3, so..I went with two. 

I'll go ahead and explain my reason for wanting to give 2 1/2 out of 5: It's because the food is great, but the service sucks. 

First time I went, it was with my roommate, and a friend of ours who goes there all the time for big family dinners and big business dinners., and due to his frequency and the subsequent big spending, knows the owner, Jackie. 

On our first visit, they greeted my friend by name, and the entire visit was stellar. Food was great, service  was fantastic, and I quickly decided that Hon Machi was my favorite new sushi place.

I went back by myself a couple of weeks later, and while the food stayed great, service went completely downhill.  They seemed surprised and a little dismayed that I was there alone.  The server kept asking me is I was \"sure\" that no one else was going to join me.  Uhmmm..yeah, I'm pretty sure about that.  I was the only one in the place and the table they sat me at was filthy.  As in, sticky spots of what appeared to be soy sauce, and shriveled piece of edamame at the far side of the table, and a few rice kernels.  Seriously. I'm the only one in the place and you sat me at THIS table?????

So, since the hostess hadn't sat me down with a menu (that's right-no menu) and disappeared right after she showed me to the table, I got up and got my own menu, and sat back down at a clean table.  They seemed put out by this until I pointed out the soy sauce edamame and rice on my previous one. No apology, and they didn't even clean it off during my entire visit.  

I placed my order for 2 rolls, one of which being the Las Vegas roll, which is always fantastic.  In fact, the food is always fantastic here, no exceptions.  After I was done with my 2 rolls, which came out 1 at a time, and took about 20-25 minutes for the first one, then another 20 for the second, they brought me the bill.  I decided to take some home to my roommate so I placed an order for a 3rd roll to go.  The server seemed confused by this, and went and got the hostess, to whom I explained that yes, I wanted another roll, but no, I didn't want to eat it here. I'm taking it home for someone else.  If I had been ordering a roll that involved raw fish, I could understand their hesitancy, but, I was ordering a fully cooked, non-tempura'd roll, so the reason for their  puzzlement over this to-go order still eludes me to this day.

I went back a month or two later with another friend, and it was his first time there and we sat by the lake on their outside patio.  As per usual, the food was great, but dinner took over 2  1/2 hours because the service was so slow.  He ordered some yellowtail sashimi, but they delivered tuna sashimi instead, and w/o thinking, he started eating it. He had never had it before and loved it, so when he was halfway done with it, the waitress came out and said \"this should have gone to someone else's table\" and started to take the plate away. My friend said \"That's fine, it actually tastes great, so you can just put it on the bill and I'll finish it.\" The waitress actually seemed upset by this! It was already halfway eaten to begin with, and my friend even offered to pay for it(this has happened to me before in restaurants and they've never asked us to pay for something that was delivered accidentally) so..was she planning on delivering it to the table that ordered it or something???? I mean, it was her fault that we ended up with it to begin with.  So, she sighed really loudly so that we knew just exactly how frustrated she was with us and went back inside and the owner, Jackie, came out and we explained that yes, it was accidentally given to us, but, thanks to a stroke of luck, we liked it anyway, and would be happy to pay for it. Jackie seemed to understand, and was fine with it.  At one point during the visit we hadn't seen our server for about 25 minutes, so I actually had to go inside and walk up to the bar with my empty glass and ask for a refill of my iced tea. 

Another time I went in there alone just as they opened the doors for lunch, and the server really acted as though it was an inconvenience having me come in and sit down and order something.  Other than the owner, the staff is rather unwelcoming and unfriendly.

So, I give this place 2 1/2 stars out of 5 because out of most restaurants goal of great food and great service, they're getting it half right.  Luckily, it's the RIGHT half to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants. Location is nice because it's overlooking the lake. Food is always prepared in a reasonable time frame and tastes very fresh! I love the Hon Machu Roll. They also have incredible lunch specials and great happy hour."}
{"text":"Amazing green tea, sushi boat, and miso! The wait staff is super friendly and attentive. The location is awesome right on the water. Not some where I would usually have gone but that's to Yelp I went. And I am sure glad I did! We went for business lunch and it was an absolute blast.
Totally fair pricing, tonssssss of food great great place! Eat inside or out."}
{"text":"After many months without a bite of sushi, I was excited to receive an invitation to join a friend for lunch at Hon Machi on Ray Road and Dobson in Chandler.  I arrived early to study the picture menu displayed outside the restaurant.  They  have lunch specials including 2 rolls for $8.95, which I happily indulged in last Friday afternoon.  The spicy salmon and Hon Machi rolls were outstanding!  In fact the Hon Machi roll was one of the best I've ever tasted!  There are plenty of options even for those who don't care for raw fish and seafood.  The best part of the setup is the lovely back patio, overlooking the pretty lake behind the restaurant.  Five stars well-deserved for outstanding service, delicious sushi and attractive decor and location."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for sushi. The sashimi salad is so good and frankly it has ruined me.  I compare all others sushi spots to it and they just don't stack up.   Tons of sushi on it and it has a delicious dressing. 

The restaurant has been recently upgraded and with a cover back patio overlooking the lake.  Very nice outside especially this time of year. 

The staff and owner are very friendly and personable as well.  

Check out this amazing little spot!"}
{"text":"Service is really bad here. The servers act like they are being forced to serve you food. No smile or welcome. Don't expect any drinks after the first one. There is normally only one server for the entire place. She obviously hates her job. The sushi is not that great. Salmon still had bits of skin in it."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall place. I'm not sure if a lady there is the owner or what, but she is there most of the time, very friendly. Every time I go there for lunch around 1pm, the place is not too busy but they have great Poki bowls.  You can customize it anyway you like and they end up giving you tons of awesome stuff in the bowl.  Tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Great spicy tuna roll, but the service tends to be below average. Stick to relatively slow times (early dinners etc) and you'll have a delicious and cheap meal."}
