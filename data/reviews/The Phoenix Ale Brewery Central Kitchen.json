{"text":"The beer is obviously great, i love the Orange Peel IPA and my wife loves the Watermelon Ale, but today on what is about our 5th visit we shared the pork shoulder taco's and they were sublime, well worth \"all the effort\" of building your own taco, brilliant."}
{"text":"Definitely a new spot in the rotation. From the street it's hard to tell if it's open because of vacant suites in front but go around back and it's a whole new scene. 
The food is excellent, it's probably the best bison burger I've ever had and I travel all over the U.S. for work. The atmosphere is 5 star, really inviting and super chill. There's a patio and plenty of light inside so it you could hang here for hours with friends, coworkers, family or just stopping by by for a beer. I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Crisp moist perfect fish n chips. Shrimp scampi & mashed potato pizza out of this world. Never had watermelon beer before. Worth the drive from Sun City Grand!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place based on the reviews.  We were greeted promptly and seated a few minutes later.  My first observation was how outrageously loud the music was.  The server basically had to lean in and yell to explain the menu.  Forget about any conversation with my girlfriend, we couldn't hear each other in the booth we were in.  The main course came out before the appetizer which was annoying.  Five small wings for $6 wasn't worth it.  I ordered the spicy chile wings and received the bbq wings, I didn't say anything since I torn on which type to get in the first place.  The only reason I would come back is to try the pretzel bites, which they ran out of.  Also the parking lot was large so you don't have to worry about finding a space.  2.5 stars for being disappointed, but I will round up to 3 for ambience of the brewery. I might come back for a beer, not food."}
{"text":"Food is soooo good here! Great fish and chips. Yummy pork tacos and the pretzel bites and cheese dip is fantastic. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Don't miss out on trying this place out soon! What a great atmosphere for sitting down with friends and family. Great brews and specialty cocktails. There were 5 adults in our party and we each tried something different on the menu and each very happy with our selections. Amy, our server took awesome care of us and the GM, Justin stopped by our table and made us feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Sunday night and was happy to see that it had a crowd and a pretty good following already. This place was very well designed, although a bit on the noisy side when it's busy. Between the overall look of the place and the menu selection I was immediately excited and thought this would become a go to spot. Unfortunately after the meal, my opinion changed. I had the beet salad and the fish and chips. The beets were good, the fish and chips were ok. The fries were a bit soggy for my liking. The fish was on par with pretty much any other bar fish and chips. Nothing stood out. I really wanted to like the place, but left feeling that it probably won't be my first dining choice in the future. Like so many places in Phoenix, the interior design is great, but there was a disconnect on the food."}
{"text":"The wings were soggy and fatty, pizza ok, and the pepperonis were cupped liked a Totino's. The orange IPA was decent. Would I come back? Maybe?"}
{"text":"We had a great afternoon with Nicole at the Phoenix Ale Brewery. First of all we didn't get killed going south on 7th. If you're from out of town approach from the south so as not to cross traffic. Parking is on E Palo Verde Avenue, as is the entrance.
My wife enjoyed the Boulevard Blonde while I was very happy with my Ironwood Porter, especially on Happy Hour prices.
I enjoyed the pretzel bits my wife not so much. We each had burgers nothing fancy but very good. The sauce on my bison burger was nice and tangy and both were cooked perfectly. The crosscut fries were a perfect side.
Very dog friendly with seating in the shaded covered patio. Nicole did an amazing job of serving us and checking us regularly, we felt very welcomed."}
{"text":"Pass, menu is hard to find a good choice. A big fan of Freddie's beers. So you choose."}
{"text":"Terrific service,  food and choice of beer.  Went here with friends and everything was great. Root beer tacos are the bomb."}
{"text":"Portions are very small. My husband ordered fried cod, which was very good but there were literally 10 fries on his plate! That is not fish and chips. 
Server was OK. Came by infrequently but nice when she did.   Did not get a name, she never introduced herself. 
I ordered the beet salad which was yummy but small for $11. More like a side salad than a full meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I were very pleased with our first experience at Phoenix Ale Brewery.  We liked the new, but sort of rustic theme. It seems fun and comfortable.  There are lots of big screen TV's with sports and concerts showing.  Although I thought it rather odd to show a concert when you can't hear the sound.  It's not too entertaining.  Stick with the sports.

We sampled three beers, the porter, pale ale, and amber ale, and I ordered the amber.  All were very good.  And I really liked them because they weren't overly hopped like so many craft brews are these days.  Please don't change the recipe to mega IBU's.

We shared the beet and arugula salad and the fish and chips.  Both were very good.  I especially like the fish.  It was some of the better fried fish I've had, especially at a craft beer place.  We also liked their slaw that came with the fish and chips.  It's is unique.  It's not sweet or overly sharp with vinegar.  It was a perfect balance.  My wife even liked it.  And she usually won't eat slaw.  The french fries were good too.

The man that seated us was very friendly and pleasant to talk with.  And our server was nice and did a good job serving us.

When the weather is right we think we might like to try sitting outside on their patio.  It looked like it would be a pleasant place for a meal. 

Overall we were very happy with out first visit and we will be back."}
{"text":"Central Kitchen is amazing!! Love the pizza, chicken wings, salads, fried chicken, steak, burgers, and beer. 

My family and I have been frequenting this restaurant since they opened over a year ago and we can't say enough about the relaxed atmosphere and phenomenal customer service. The wait staff and management are second to none (shout out to Justin and Coly).

Great place all the way around!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff here really goes above and beyond. I ordered online last week, and DoorDash had some kind of tech disaster that resulted in their drivers not getting orders until hours after they'd been submitted. Not only did one of the guys at Phoenix Ale Brewery call to let me know that my food had been ready for half an hour and check if I'd cancelled or not, he also had someone wait on hold with Door Dash trying to help figure the situation out, and called a couple more times later to update me as we tried to get things sorted. When the delivery guy FINALLY showed up much later, the guys re-cooked a whole new order for me fresh in record time, and they even called me the next morning to let me know they'd finally got through to DD and I'd be getting a refund. The situation was a big hassle, but the whole time the guy I spoke with at Phoenix Ale was always friendly and helpful.

On top of that, the food was great! The pretzel bites with caraway come with a really awesome cheese sauce and whole-grain mustard. It's a good-sized portion and they really don't skimp on the sauces. We were tempted to eat the extra beer cheese with a spoon, it's so good. The 10 inch pizza is surprisingly large, plenty of food for two people. We had the Calabrese, which was spicier than I'd expected. Good amount of toppings, not too heavy or soggy despite the thicker crust. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'd definitely like to go back in person."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic. The vegan options were flavorful. And, of course, the beer was stellar."}
{"text":"This is a good place.  The food is a solid B+ and the beers are excellent.  Love the atmosphere too.  I hit this place up to hang out with friends and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  The food and beers are good, but it's pricey and nothing special.  You can have the same experience at North Mountain for less money and attitude.  Or head across the hall to Okra, which is unique and has a killer happy hour."}
{"text":"Absolutely, hands alllllllll the way down .... THE BEST pizza in phoenix!!

Damn! good good goood ....im sitting here and cannot remember the last time i'd even written a review; this deserves it! Trust and believe me, chewy and crunchy, unbelievable sauce and sausage similar to 1980s dominos pizza ....it is a good nite to die."}
{"text":"Perfect for your inner Foodie! Interesting, modern flair to some old favorites. Who doesn't love Mac-n-Cheese in a skillet?! Pork Shoulder tacos were incredible, and had a unique spicy flair. Hint: Have the house made jalapeno infused tequila with the tacos! Perfect combination.
Also try the Bourbon Almonds. Amazing!
First time trying PAB brews, but it won't be the last. Everything we had was a solid contender. Glad to have found Central Kitchen! A new Phoenix favorite.
Entrance and parking is tough to find, as you don't approach from the main street, but once you find it, there's ample space."}
{"text":"I want to like this place because I want to like local breweries.  Unfortunately, I don't. I tried both IPA's (Orange Peel and Camelback) and both we're mediocre:  flat and uninteresting. The camelback was a little better, but nowadays that is not good enough. 

The food was ok - I had a steak salad. It was fine. 

The atmosphere was pretty good; cool bar overall, but too loud and too dark. 

My server was attentive and nice enough - best part of the night.  Too many other places to come back, though..."}
{"text":"Fact: Arizona's restaurant industry posts the largest in growth, sales and jobs in the nation. It's probably all due to the wild storm of building activity on Seventh Street in Phoenix. No wonder they're calling it \"Restaurant Row.\" New eateries are spreading faster than a grease fire on a kitchen stove. 

The latest spark is Central Kitchen, located at the Crown on 7th, the hub for Chef Cullen Campbell's restaurant Okra, and other choice retail and service shops. This neighborhood-y, casual, wood-heavy sports video bar-slash-restaurant with a definite \"straight\" vibe is friendly and emphasizes a great choice of over a dozen sudsy craft beers and foam capped ales. Got the hungries? Their pantry is packed with pots and pans, plates and platters ready to be filled a variety of vittles to please your palate along with a hint of which beer will enhance the taste and culinary experience. 

We started off Pretzel Bites for $8. These dense, mini-rolls of traditional Bavarian bread are fresh from the over, sprinkled with salt. The warm Bird City Pale Ale cheese fondue is blended with caraway, giving the flavor a twist. Try the to-die-for house-made Ironwood Porter mustard with whole mustard seeds. The $4 ramekin of  Orange Peel IPA Marinated Olives are deliciously oily, although we couldn't detect much in the way of the beer marinade that we noticed. Two kinds of Chicken Wings, a Charcuterie Sampler, Chicken Tenders, Black Bean Hummus and peanuts help start the meal and great for sharing. 

The Roasted and Pickled Beets are a vitamin and mineral powerhouse. Here they're served with an all too small dab of whipped goat cheese, crushed almonds and grilled focaccia. Not bad (if you like beets--we do) but expected so much more to warrant the whopping $11 price tag. 

If you've got an appetite, Central Kitchen has a six main courses specializing in \"comfort food\" from this side of the border as well as the other. The Ale House Chicken Fried Chicken was so good it had our tongues knockin' out the back of our front teeth just to get at it. The Orange Peel IPA-brined boneless chicken breast, mashed Red Bliss potatoes with chicken gravy reminds you of what made America great. For $13 it was a winner, winner, chicken dinner. 

Fish and chips, Macaroni & Cheese, Root Beer-brined Pork Shoulder Tacos, Steak 'n' Taters and and a Grilled Gulf Prawn Tostada round out the Main Menu. 

Love pizza? Central Kitchen founder Rich Stark is the former CEO of NYPD Pizza brings his know-how with the Black Iron Pizza, a baked thin-crust pie, hand-formed available in 10\" and 14\" sizes. Six different styles, plus a \"Do It Yourself\" option are available. The Brewmaster ($12.50 & $16.50) includes house sauce, smoked mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage and bacon. The perfect crust wasn't too thin, the toppings were plentiful and the flavor couldn't be beat. 

Central Kitchen has a selection of burgers and sandwiches, plus plenty of soups, salads and chili. Finish your meal off with one of Mamma Toledo's mouthwatering pies, baked locally. 

Your meal can be complemented by the craft beer on tap, which ranges from 4.8 to 10.1 per cent alcohol content (quaff carefully!) Not only that, Central Kitchen participates in the Cicerone Beer Certification program, making them experts. Can't decide? They'll help! Try a flight with four sample beers. (You'll go nuts for the White Chocolate Ale.) 

Pay it forward. \"Buy a Buddy a Brew!\" Pick out a pint for your bestie, give Central Kitchen your pal's name and email, and they'll have 30 days to belly up to the bar and bend their elbow, thanks to you. Plus, you'll see your names scroll by on the screen, so you'll feel like big shots. Or pints, in this case."}
{"text":"First time, had lunch. Enjoyed the tasting flight of brews. Good fish & chips, wonderful romain salad & shrimp. Nice inside, comfortable. Was late lunch so not too busy, attentive server. Will return to sample the guest brews & the steak!"}
{"text":"Our experience was not good overall.  The service was dreadful, and had it not been for a cheery young woman who seemed to be the hostess who was darting around troubleshooting, we would have been really ticked off.  There were some pluses though few.  The steak salad contained steak that was impossible to eat, and the cheeseburgers were just so-so.  In general, because of the chaotic service or lack thereof, and the spotty food quality, we won't go back."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite place. The tomato soup with grilled cheese was excellent !  Great service at the bar and I loved the watermelon ale."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices and the servers were very friendly. The only thing we didn't like was how dark it was inside. Overall though this place was great. Their fried chicken is the best!!"}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood hang-out! Great decor, craft beers and craft food, with a friendly vibe that invites you to come and stay awhile. Wait staff is excellent - friendly and efficient, attentive without being annoying. Dog-friendly patio that overlooks a nice green courtyard is a great spot to meet up with friends and give Fido an outing too! It's a little hard to spot from the street, with parking/entrance around back, but well worth searching for. I've already been there several times - just can't resist those pretzel bites - and it's definitely on my list of must-go-back-soon favorites!"}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere and the bartenders are knowledgable of their beers and other locals. The Koffee Kolsch from Sonoran was my favorite. I'll be back to try the food."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Phoenix Ale Brewery! They're were many options to choose from and cool events going on that you could sign up for! The only confusing part was my GPS took me to the front, where there was not parking for the restaurant, you have to park in the back! Also they kept filling up my water, which is great, but there was much more ice than water in my glass. It was a good atmosphere, nice waitress, and overall good experience! I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have always had excellent service here and the waitresses are always very nice, great food too  Sounds like Kris T. Might have been already been having a bad day before dining here!  And who evesdrops on a private conversation and then post it. Hmmm..."}
{"text":"We had great beer, simply amazing food (I forgot to take pics, it was so good) and the servers were friendly and helpful. 

Just a great time. 

Parking is in the back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a great time at Central Kitchen last week. The wait staff was very accommodating and attentive to our group. The wait staff also help us surprise our friend the 'birthday boy' with their 'Buy a Buddy a Brew' promotion.  He was able to try several of the beers including King George Amber and Biltmore Blonde.  All of the food we ordered was delicious--I especially like the Mashed-Black Iron Pizza.  The atmosphere was modern and clean.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and staff here is awesome! Had the Beet salad and Biltmore Blonde for lunch.  It is delicious"}
{"text":"Love love love!!!

From the second we walked in, we were greeted by 3 people who were all smiling. Love that

We were sat and I always get wine and my husband gets beer, very reasonable prices. Pizza is amazing and I've gotten it a few times. I like the one with all the meat. My husband got the fish and chips and he also said it was delicious. Service has always been great and consistent. It's nice that they work as a team to make sure guests have everything they need. What else could you ask for?! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"We just discovered this place and EVERYTHING we ordered was delicious! We had the wings, chili, mac n cheese with chicken a d the black bean hummus! Besides the food being awesome the service was amazing! Which being from the midwest I find hard to find sometimes in AZ. Also, a server took our drink order and while we were waiting 2 other employees came up to us asking if anyone got our drink order yet. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Casual ambiance with outdoor patio seating. In this particular visit there were a ton of families with little kids which made me question if this was a place of choice for families. There is a little grassy area for kids to run around in outside, so maybe. Food was good, service was great. I'd come back here."}
{"text":"There are some good ideas on the menu but the execution is lacking a bit. More attention to details would help this place a lot. I like deviled eggs and they can be a great appetizer. While there was nothing wrong with the eggs we were served, they wasn't anything special about them, either (especially for $3 for 3 pieces.) Bourbon spiced almonds sound great but these were mostly sugared almonds with barely a hint of spice. I ordered the roasted and pickled beet salad as an entree. It was served piled high on a plate, which is a serious pet peeve. It is much easier to mix a salad in a large bowl rather than trying too keep everything on a plate. More importantly, there were no pickled beets and the salad really could have benefited from the tang. Again, it was OK, but could have been much better. My partner ordered chicken wings and they were...fine. They would have been better if they were served with a dipping sauce (ranch was provided after we asked) and a side of carrots or veggies. We did not have beer but our dining companions did and reported that it was good, which I guess is the main reason people will go here, but there are many places to go in Phoenix for good beer. Good food will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all, won't bother to go back. Really noisy but nice facility. The beer was not cold enough for me so I asked for a frosty mug and the waitress told me the beer was intended to be served warmer. I told her I like mine colder. The bison burger was very average at best. The chicken fried chicken was good."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my husband and I were completely under whelmed by our experience today when we randomly stopped in for a late lunch. All of the staff members seemed to be moving at a sluggish pace. The restaurant had maybe 4 people at the bar and 3 occupied tables, so certainly not enough people to warrant waiting for 15-20 minutes to receive a beer. Our server forgot to bring extra bread for soup that my husband ordered. Additionally, the draft beer was only slightly chilled. The food was average - not bad, but not anything memorable. We ultimately felt like the staff didn't want to be there, were not engaging, and it left us saying (before the food even came out) that we would not be returning.

I will say the one thing I did like was the decor, which is the reason for not giving only 1 star. The seating was comfortable, and the patio was cute."}
{"text":"Great start for a new restaurant! Great staff - saw quite a few familiar faces and met some new people. Food was delicious. I had the Melrose pizza and my husband had the chili. We both shared the pretzel bites and the guajillo wings. I don't really have any complaints other than the price in the beer rang up wrong. 

Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food and service is excellent here. All homemade and fresh. Very kid friendly too! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Beer cheese pretzel bites are GREAT!  I have to say that again... Beer cheese pretzel bites are GREAT!

The breading on the Fish and Chips was very good.  My wife really liked the veggie burger too!"}
{"text":"The entire dining experience was flawless!  More than ample parking behind restaurant, great setting-very comfortable, not noisy, very attractive-kudos to physical designers, great selection of brews with descriptions and innovative cocktail list, excellent food. Some items never seen around town before. Loved the pretzel bites and how they were served, the grilled romaine was a nice change from the usual caesar salad, and the black iron pizza was excellent. Can't wait to go back again. Rich Stark really has shown he knows what it takes to put forth a new and interesting food/drink emporium in the Phoenix-Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"We found Phoenix Ale Brewery on Yelp and we're excited to try a new-to-us Phoenix spot with such a high rating. Unfortunately, our experience missed the mark. I knew it was a bad sign when it took more than 10 minutes to get a drink order in. The restaurant was not busy. The service staff seemed confused- we had 2 different people as servers but both were unsure about who had taken our order. This might sound dramatic, but it then became my responsibility to make sure that our order was placed instead of being taken care of by our server(s). We ordered the pretzel bites, Mac and cheese with bacon, and the chopped salad. 

The pretzel bites were fine- they came out piping hot and had great presentation. However, they had some sort of herb on top that wasn't our favorite.

The Mac and cheese was too spicy to eat- and I'm all about the spicy life. We didn't finish it or take a box. The chopped salad was just....a salad. Nothing exciting. We also added avocado and we got two small slices of an unripe avocado. 

No one came and checked on us during our meal. After sitting for a while, I finally had to go get our server so we could pay. Again, frustrating when we came for a relaxing experience. Perhaps this is a good spot to grab a beer in nice ambiance, but I won't be back for food."}
{"text":"Awesome all around! Abby and Justin, you rock. Love the brew and food too. Best service. Go Scorpions!"}
{"text":"This place was okay.  Burgers were dry, unfortunately.  Good fries.  Fried chicken was good, but the breading had corn meal in it, which I didn't really like.  Over complicating fried chicken is a no-no.  Mashed tatters and gravy were good."}
{"text":"Incredible craft brews. Light and fun atmosphere. Great happy hour. Good service. Friendly crowd. Wish there was a larger draft but still not too bad of a selection! 

It's located in the back of a plaza and it has ample parking as well. Their hues brews are just as good as their in house brews. My favorite was the Cali Dreamin Cream Ale!"}
{"text":"Excellent beers. Service was friendly and frequent. Ambiance was....woody. Fish and chips were so fresh and crunchy. Nice place to talk about deep heartfelt issues and also crack up about silliness of life."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing smoked salt and pepper wings! Great service, inviting atmosphere, pretzel bites were fantastic as well."}
{"text":"We came here for a company lunch. I ordered a burger and it was a little rare for my liking. I asked my server if she could have it tossed on the grill for a little longer. She did it and was really nice about it, I have a lot of social anxiety and things like sending food back are really scary for me. I have always had a really pleasant experience coming here, but today they really went above and beyond for me and all of my colleagues. Will definetly be coming back here!!"}
{"text":"I ordered wings, pretzel bites, and the bison burger. On a Saturday night, they ran out of the pretzel bites by 8p. :(

The sauce on the wings was good, but the chicken was overcooked and not memorable.

The bison burger was ok, but it was like the bison patty was in witness protection--hidden and drowned in BBQ sauce with canned mushrooms, and again with the canned mushrooms...why? That's just not necessary. 

In short, the burger doesn't compare to burgers at other local joints (e.g. Joe's Midnight Run, Ingo, etc...).

Ambiance and waitstaff were nice overall.

Too bad...I was looking forward to this place based on the great reviews, but then again, I didn't order beer or pizza."}
{"text":"The owner responded promptly and made the situation right . We will see you this weekend. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and was very impressed with the menu and the beer and food was great.  I had the Brazilian Black beer, which was very good.  We started with the pretzel bites.  The caraway seeds gave them a slightly different taste than your normal pretzel bite and I really liked that.  For entrees, my husband had the Chicken Fried Chicken and said it was fantastic (the couple next to us were also raving about it, which is how he came to order it).  I had the Citrus Orange Peel IPA Grilled Chicken.  Everything on there went perfectly together.  The bun was slightly sweet and very soft, the chicken perfectly seasoned and cooked and the pepper jam and whipped avocado were the perfect topping.  It was excellent and we will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"We were there last night (Fri). Couldn't find the damn place, the front had a \"For Lease\", \"Open in Back\". We couldn't figure out how to get in the back. When we finally did the place was so dark we only saw the restaurant next door and a, \"Crown Parking Only\" sign. We called for help and the dummy who answered the phone was NO help, \"We're right here!\" Duh. We finally saw it and found out we could park there, the music was so loud we couldn't stay inside so we stayed on the unheated patio, which was quite cold. We had Brazilian Black Ale which was good and smooth. Husband had a bison burger which was also good. Our servers were nice. I would not go back and deal with the music and the patio which is probably either too hot or too cold most of the time."}
{"text":"Really cool space and great beer selection but food was just ok. 

Came for dinner with wife and friend from out of town. Share the pretzel bites, mashed potato pizza and grilled chicken sandwich. All weren't bad but weren't great either. 

But we are true fans of the beer and the selection they have. They do a great job of truly running the gambit from light to dark. 

Biltmore blonde is simply but is really one of my all time favs."}
{"text":"The fact that I am giving it 4 stars even though I'm not really a fan of their beer should say a lot.  The location is great, the service was flawless, and the food was above average.  I ordered the pimento grilled cheese withe bacon and it was pretty tasty.  My wife and I also shared the black bean hummus.  Their tortilla chips were sprinkled with Old Bay, I think.  Different, but good.  If you're in the area, you should give it a try.  Always support local business!"}
{"text":"Beer was descent. Food was pretty good. I got the bison burger and it was awesome!! But my Dad got chicken fried chicken it was not great. My wife got tacos, they were a little odd. Wasn't too impressed. The pretzel bites pretty good. Music was a little loud. The manager was great!! All and all a good experience."}
{"text":"Beer was great and food was good.  I especially enjoyed the crispy thin crust pizza baked in cast iron.   Our issue was their policy of not allowing a party of 5 to sit at a bigger table.  The restaurant was empty, but we were forced to sit at a table for 4 with 5 very tall adults.  We had no room for beer and food.  We asked about it multiple times - it became a joke.  But the staff was adamant that despite having an empty restaurant, we couldn't move to a bigger table."}
{"text":"Yum! Came here with my partner and was not disappointed. I had a Baja fish taco (happy hour $4) that was perfect - nice light, crispy batter! We also tried the orange peel IPA olives, which were also excellent (the bread that comes with it is fabulous, think there might be rosemary in it). For our meals, I had the avocado toast with added egg and he had the black bean burger. The toast was nice, nothing crazy but still really good. The burger was very tasty (and the waffle fries we chose as the side - DOPE). Overall the food was really good and the service was excellent. We will definitely be back soon to try the beer"}
{"text":"Met up with a good friend for brunch recently---we had a LOT of catching up to do and wanted to try a new place.  I was excited about trying this place, as it had an interesting menu and was centrally located.

We both arrived at around 11ish and were the only ones seated inside.  I talked with the hostess for a bit about service and she mentioned they had had some problems in that area.  As an aspiring cafe owner and someone who dines out a LOT, I really notice good and bad service and know what an impact it can have on success.  Many times it is more important than the food and beverages.  

We ordered some pretzel bites with beer cheese and some fabulous cold-brew coffee on our waiter's suggestion.  We caught up for a while before ordering breakfast.  Their menu is simple but I was intrigued by the opportunity to order breakfast foods a la carte.

Our waiter, Justin, was on point!   He made suggestions, kept our water glasses full, and made sure we were entertained.  HE was fabulous.  The other staff, not so much.  We were studiously ignored most of the time, even when I attempted to flag down a passing server.  

All in all, this was a disappointing experience overall.  I really want for this place to succeed---it's cute and nicely located but I suspect I won't be back unless things improve dramatically"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place after an afternoon happy hour hopping on bikes. After being disappointed with the shit service at several other spots, we went by The Crown development and popped in Phoenix Ale.

Dig the building, looks very cool. The bar for Phoenix Ale is awesome, and has an interesting mid-century industrial look. 

Service was great. Very helpful and friendly bartender. Walked us through happy hour specials and was happy to chat about menu items.

Ordered a pizza. A square pizza that came in a baking pan. It was awesome. Sort of \"Detroit\" style, but with a thinner crust. Their happy hour selections of sliders and fish and chips also sounded epic, but I was too full to throw down. Next time, for sure...

They lose 2 stars because of the beer selection. House beers are AWFUL! Seriously some of the worst I've encountered, the IPA is garbage. Arizona cannot create good beer, and I wish Phoenix Ale would expand their offerings to include more drinkable beers. The 3 non-house beers we had were fantastic, 2 of which I'd never seen anywhere before. Good shit."}
{"text":"What a great place to start our Arizona tour! The manager? and server were so helpful here with their recommendations! As we consider ourselves beer tourists to everywhere we go, it's always great to get the insider tips! I mean, how many cars are waiting in parking lots with two under age youth before  11:00am before a brewery opens? This place was amazing with recommendations for up north as well as quinine at the brewery, would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Service is great. Staff is friendly and it's a great atmosphere.  Beer is cold and they have a great selection. The Orange peel is a must try if you like IPAs. The pork tacos are delicious and you can't go wrong with the wings."}
{"text":"We stopped in the other night with a few friends on the way to a concert. The place was crowded and we were seated outside. We all ordered various drinks and the watermelon ale was by far the table favorite. Food was excellent as well.  The pork shoulder tacos, bison burger, and mac n cheese were all fantastic! Great food, great drink selection, great atmosphere! 
Our only knock would be drink service was quite slow and I don't think the patio heaters were working. However, it was early evening and not that cold yet.
Prices are moderate to the higher side but, the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"First time here.. great layout and atmosphere.  The grilled wings were fantastic. Smoked Pulled port tacos were lacking spice and a bit dry.  Needed green chili sauce to make this a winner.  Flank steak was the hit at the table.  Great service. John was terrific and all staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"First visit:

Business opened in May 2016.

Dropped in, by myself, on a Wednesday, just after the lunch rush.

Location is easily accessible from downtown. About 5 miles north of Washington, on N 7th St. Also, not a stretch, from PHX.
From the street, I wondered if they were open. There are some boarded up windows, but that is misleading. Find your way your the parking lot and entrance, at the back of the building.

Cool gastro pub decor. Industrial chic.

Varied and numerous choices of beer. 8 or 10 of their own, plus about that number of guest handles.

Food: I ordered the Mash Pizza. Mashed potatoes, green onion, garlic, and added sausage at the recommendation of the bartender.
I've had potato pizzas, before, so it wasn't a big leap, for me. Not something you see everyday. Pizza was cooked and served in a square, deep pan, though it was more of a thin crust. Absolutely delicious!! I ended up purchasing tix for a special,  upcoming for & beer event.

Service: Fabulous. Post lunch rush, I received so extra special treatment. John (beertender/server) and I talked beer & food. I got a couple little tasters, for free. Justin (GM) spent some time with me, especially after I mentioned my membership in Scottsdale Beer Club. He hooked me up with a couple Buddy Brews, where you buy a friend, a future beer. Program gets your friends on a mailing list. Cool idea.

Loved the place. I'll be back. This area is booming with great gastropubs."}
{"text":"Finally tried Phoenix Ale Brewery Central Kitchen after eating across the Hall at Okra several times. Was not disappointed. Enjoyed the streak and mash along with the Biltmore Blonde which I thought was great value for the money and very tasty. Will be coming back for the pretzel bites and other menu items I thought sounded good."}
{"text":"Tried this for Mother's Day.. excellent service from CE and great food and beer. Local beer was really good. We had Chicken fried chicken, salads, wings (which were excellent) pork shoulder tacos and cocktails. My Manhattan was just okay but it's an alehouse so I give them a little leeway there. Overall, excellent food and service.. a good experience. Will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"I ate here Sunday night it was my first time.  It has a neighborhood pub atmosphere.  Staff was friendly and attentive. I had the Brew burger it was very tasty with the carmelize onions very good, for my side I tried their Mac n Chees it was delicious.  I am not a beer drinker but they do offer mixed drinks and wine.  I would recommend this place for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I love the industrial feel of this restaurant. I really enjoy fish and chips and this place didn't disappoint! I enjoyed a sour beer with my meal and left full. The food was hot and the waitress was cool and friendly. My friends' meals all looked delicious too."}
{"text":"Everything thing about this brewery restaurant is great! Beer is excellent along with there food and service! The black iron pizza is the best pizza that I have had since I moved here in 2000! Fish and chips are to die for along with the rest of the food that has creativity in all of there dishes! The General Manager is great and very knowledgeable about the food and beers! You will be a repeat customer!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The music had a good vibe. The service was dreamt. The steak and taters taste pretty good. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  This place has near perfect service and excellent food.  The location is also what makes stopping by a must. I could not give them stars is that they have a a watermelon ale that is horrible.  This is one of their their brews that is said to be excellent l, and it is not. So I am saying go and have an awesome time with fantastic service, great food..just don't get the watermelon ale."}
{"text":"the food is pretty good and the beer is pretty good but they refused to put NASCAR on the TV. the same game was on 3 TVs they said they would not put NASCAR on no big deal I can live with that but then someone came in and they switch to golf. that's pretty crappy wouldn't let me switch it to NASCAR but let this yo-yo turned 2 golf I guess you gotta know someone here we obviously didn't everyone was waiting for okra to eat next door anyways"}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 3 stars is the beer. The food was mediocre at best, but the local beer selections were pretty great. Will definitely be back for a drink--I'll just make sure to eat before."}
{"text":"This was my husband and I's first time here. Aside from not knowing where the entrance was, I really like this place!!! The atmosphere is super cool with a modern/industrial vibe. The space was very open with a huge bar and big t.v.s. 

I ordered the Hess My Own Vice, which is a sour. It is not often that breweries have sours on tap, so I was really excited! My husband ordered their Dragoon IPA and really enjoyed it. Monday through Thursday's they have discounts on growlers and crawlers so definitely stop in one a week Day to get some delicious brews.

We were in a hurry so we just ordered the pretzel bites. They were good, not too salty. The cheese sauce was creamy and had good flavor. The mustard was a little strong for me, but with a dab of that and then dipped in the cheese sauce, I found it delightful.

Looking forward to going back for some lunch, a couple of sours and a growler"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Amazing staff! Amazing manger! Amazing owner! First time here and  they really know how to treat their customers here! Plus the food and drinks are really good! Walked in with my wife and we had the best time start to finish! We will absolutely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Once we figured out how to get into the restaurant, everything was great. We walked in the door and knew we were in the right place. Cool vibe and decor...immediate service with a smile. 
The menu had a lot of variety...the kids had no problem finding something yummy. Great beer selection and they do a fine job with their brews. We had the orange peel IPA and a seasonal wheat beer. Perfection!
Miles was our waiter and was very knowledgeable about the beers and food menu. He provided a lot of good suggestions. 
The big thing for us was how they handled a mistake. My wife ordered pizza and they burnt it, requiring them to make a new one. The manager came over and was extremely apologetic and bought her a beer. They also took the cost of the pizza off the bill. 
Great food, beer and service! Can't wait to go back and try more of their menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time. It was during their restaurant week, so they had a three course meal for $33 a person, it also included two beers per person. Overall it was very good. Atmosphere is exactly what we look for in a brewery/craft kitchen. The grilled Romaine and pretzel bites we delicious. Some of the best we have had. The choice of burgers and pizzas was great and they have a decent beer selection. Only reason for four stars and not five is because the prices of their food and beer, aside the $33 menu, were very high for the quality. Altogether though it was a great first experience and we'd most likely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Had a great first visit last night and we'll definitely go back soon!! We started off with a flight of beer and chose a couple more after that. I also tried the Blanco Saguaro, the hint of jalapeño gave it the perfect bite. The pretzel bites were yummy, my husband enjoyed his BBQ bison burger and I loved my steak and taters......and I could of eaten two more servings of the sautéed kale!! Thanks for a great date night!!"}
{"text":"Through a total organizational failure on my part I left work early but ended up two hours early to an event in midtown Phoenix, 30 minutes from home and 30 minutes from work. With some time to kill, I found this brewery in walking distance and decided to hang out for a bit.

They have a ton of local (indicated by a Phoenix label) and other well known craft beer in their tap selection. I had their orange peel IPA which was fantastic, and super reasonably priced, especially during happy hour. I didn't have any of the food, but they had a pretty appetizing menu of pub grub like Mac n cheese, tacos, burgers, etc. Would definitely be worth a try if I had been hungry. 

It's a medium sized venue with a kind of woodsy/modern vibe accommodating booth and various table seating. While I was here there was a pretty large group of what looked like coworkers hanging out, seems like a pretty nice spot for that. There's also a patio with a deck and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this spot. Of all the places that have opened (and closed) on 7th St recently, this one is the most solid when it comes to food, beers and service. Justin is the GM and a great guy. Rosemary has taken care of me at the bar in multiple occasions, and is so much fun! The smoked wings are the best in town. Mashed potato pizza- where has this been all my life? Stop in and support local businesses and tip your server well!"}
{"text":"Great service from Mariann and Miles!!! Pork tacos were the bomb!!! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The bison burger is bomb and the wings are the 2nd best I have had in Phoenix. Not to mention the pretzel bites with the beer cheese fondu is also bomb. It's just great all around plus the beer is great too!"}
{"text":"Central Kitchen! I can't rave about their food enough. Wings, buffalo burger, pork tacos, and the fish and chips(especially those) have been consistently better than average! Even 30 minutes before close (we were accidentally \"those\" people) it was still as fresh as the dinner rush. AND! Our bartender, Johnny, was friendly and gave great beer suggestions! My 5th time here and I'd give it 5 yet again."}
{"text":"Came for Happy Hour with a friend before they left for the airport. Had a great selection of local brews which he got and I got a hand pressed margarita which was phenomenal! On the happy hour menu we got the waffle fries to share and I got the pork belly sliders which were very tasty. The service started strong and tapered off towards the end of the meal but I did speak with the owner who was very nice and personable. I look forward to coming back for dinner soon!"}
{"text":"It's been quite a journey for the Phoenix area microbrewery scene.  For the longest time you'd be hard pressed to find 3 or 4 locally based microbreweries in town despite the valley's exploding population.  Only in the last 5 years has the valley started to see the microbrewery scene blossom with great local brands.  Phoenix Ale Brewery being among them.  Having sampled their beers before and having a discount dinner coupon on me, I decided to give Phoenix Ale's Central Kitchen a try with my Dad for dinner on a Sunday night.

The location is set in the back of a completely redone shopping center that I believe at one point was home to a giant Hobby Lobby-type craft store.  Its a little hard to find the restaurant if you don't know the area, but just be sure to park in the back and look for the entrance right next door to another restaurant called Okra.  The inside incorporates a hybrid look of beer tasting room and sports bar, with plenty of seating both inside and on the patio.  This would be a great place to catch NFL Sunday midday.  

For my first time meal here, I decided to go with a burger.  The one I went with was the Ale House 3 Meats burger.  Basically a burger with two types of bacon and mozzarella as the cheese topper.  Served with regular fries.  The burger was solid as I loved the mix of the leaner Canadian bacon with the mozzarella cheese.  But the biggest compliant I have and the reason I docked two stars was the price.  For the portion of burger and fries I got, this was pretty pricey at $14.  It was a good burger, but I could name a number of establishments that serve up a bigger burger and fries portion for equal or lesser price than Central Kitchen.  

Total price for my burger and beer (as well as a regular cheeseburger and beer for my Dad) plus tax and tip came to about $45.  For the amount of food we got, that's pretty steep.  The burgers were good, but can't say they were OMG good.  I had a coupon this go around that docked $10 off my meal, so that softened the blow.  But if I came back here again, it would probably just for a beer or perhaps I'd take a gander at their happy hour specials to see if those are a better value.  So the moral of the story here is come for the beer, stay for the food only if you're not on a budget."}
{"text":"This place works for all things, been there for a beer after work. Took the GF for a couple of drinks and some appetizers (full bar).
The patio is dog friendly and kid friendly. Had a few beers with some friends while watching the game. Always had a good experience with the kitchen and bar."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio. Service was good. Food was better than good. Great buildout-very industrial cool. Plenty of TVs if you are a sports fanatic.  Beer selection was good-heavy with hops. Wait staff was knowledgeable and offer a sample when we were unsure about a selection. A lot of bar seating and outdoor seating. Very hip and bathrooms were clean!"}
{"text":"Came here originally to try some beer one night a few months ago. Really loved the beer and didn't think twice about trying any food or even thought to ask about the food. Boy was that a mistake! Went back a few weeks ago for some beers once again. The bartender offered us  a food menu. We decided we were hungry and why not give it a try. BEST DECISION EVER!!! So now, not only are we in love with the beer, we are in love with the food!! 

When we were here the other night. I felt like I had walked in to a dream. The first thing the bartender asked me was \"Can I recommend something I'm really excited about?\" I said \"Of course!\"   \"Well if you like Sour's...\" I stopped him there. I said, \"Say no more, my answer is yes!\" and he poured me a delicious Sour Beer. Then he recommended the STEAK 'N' TATERS So we gave it a go. SO GOOD! I have never had a \"Flat Iron Steak\" that tender. And that Porter Mushroom Gravy... \"Excuse me... can I get a gallon for home so I can put that ishhhh... on everything!?!?\"  Then we decided on the ROOT BEER-BRINED AND SMOKED PORK SHOULDER TACOS. Just perfect. They pickle some jalapeno's in some of their IPA. Uhhh... yum! I will say these meals are not sharable. They are the perfect size for one person. BUT I also recomed doing how we do and eat half of eachothers meals. Because the food here is too good not to try it all. I can not wait to come back and try some new items."}
{"text":"Visiting from Portland. Quick service, great food, good selection of drinks. Sports bar flavor location but nice diversion with kids. All around hit. Pork shoulder tacos were awesome. Keep in mind I was there on a Saturday night at 5:30 so your mileage may vary"}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday to check out the Phoenix Ale Kitchen after really enjoying our beer tasting at their original brewery location.  The space is bright and open, the staff is very nice...especially our great and helpful bartender, the drink and food list is extensive and everything sounded great.  I enjoyed a cider, my husband enjoyed their amberand and we shared an order of pretzel bites with beer cheese fondue and mustard - yummy!"}
{"text":"John F behind the bar is nothing short of  a rockstar ! He greets you with a smile and friendly hello .The drink menu is a real crowd pleaser.His presentation is impeccable,the drink concoctions are premium,delicious,far from ordinary .Professional,personable and resourceful are all words to describe John and his team! FANTASTIC SERVICE i received .I give my highest recommendation !"}
{"text":"What a find! We came here after a hike after my sister-in-law's recommendation, and we're all really happy that we took her up on it. I'm not a beer drinker so I can't say much for the brewery aspect, but my table tried about five beers and it sounded like everyone enjoyed what they got. We also got the pretzel bites, pork shoulder tacos, chicken sandwich, mashed potato pizza, guajillo wings, and chili. The pretzel bites come with a side of mustard, and a little cast iron pot of melted cheese! I wasn't a big fan of the pretzels themselves, as they're topped with salt and caraway seeds and I don't love the seeds. The cheese fondue was amazing though, in addition to being really cute! I got the mashed potato pizza and it was awesome. I used to eat mashed potato pizza in college (https://www.yelp.com/biz/bar-new-haven?osq=bar+pizza) and when I saw it at the menu, I couldn't resist. This one comes in a slightly different form factor as it's square and instead of clumps of mashed potato on the top, the potato is incorporated below the cheese. It was so tasty! I highly recommend it. My friends only had good things to say about the rest of the food too.

Happy hour is 3-6, Monday-Friday. The beer and well drinks are $4, wine is $6, and a few of the appetizers are $1-2 off."}
{"text":"Would rate 10 stars for our service if I could! Our server, Chris, was wonderful! So friendly, funny, and attentive, but still very genuine. We went here for restaurant week, so you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert for a set price. The fish and chips, and churros with beer anglaise were so great! I have to reiterate the amazing service Chris provided! 10/10!"}
{"text":"For a new restaurant the food was very good and the wait staff friendly.  The steak was cooked properly, the fish (COD) was tasty & the chicken crispy.  I would go back."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!!  I have nothing but great things to say about this establishment. 

I was pulled in for restaurant week. I always like to try out new places during this time and they had an awesome deal for $33. 

Started off with a flight of beer. We were restricted to only their beers for the restaurant week deal. (I'm not sure if this is how it always is). Nonetheless it was still great!  The flight only counted towards 1 of the 2 drinks we were offered in the deal. 

Everyone in my party got their own appetizer. Can I say the salt & pepper and the BBQ wings were both exquisite!  So much flavor and nothing was drowned out by too much sauce or seasoning. 

For my entree I got the brewmaster pizza. It's their version of a meat lovers. HIGHLY impressed. Even after sharing the pizza I still had 4 pieces left to take home so I'll be happy later today when I heat it up. 

I ended with the churros. They are so fluffy on the inside. I've never had a churro that was as light and airy!  The sauce that is made out of their beer was such an added bonus to the amazing churros.

All these great flavors on top of the incredible service the waitress, RoseMary, offered us just amplified our awesome experience. 

Please stop by and give this place a try.. you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch on a Tuesday and the lunch special was pulled pork tacos which came with a pint of beer for only $10, and it was excellent! The tacos were served generously & were excellent! We tried their Porter & Orange peel IPA, both were excellent. The server was a really nice younger guy who made a good experience even better. I'd highly recommend this spot and hope to return."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and my husband and I LOVED it!!! Greeted by a super friendly smile and great warm atmosphere. Yes TV 's are here to watch your favorite game! Fish and chips and amazing crispy fries! The  Chicken fingers are perfect! We will be back over and over again! They didn't have cocktail sauce so the general manager made some from scratch!!! Way over the top , incredible service! Thank you Coly and team for exceptional customer service! See you soon!"}
{"text":"They are so nice, so generous. The food is delicious and MY GOD THE COLE SLAW! Their chicken gravy is yum and I wish I could inject their BBQ sauce! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Nice patio, decent service a bit slow. Some interesting items on the menu but over priced."}
{"text":"If you come down to this area at a busy time, I definitely recommend coming here over some of the other restaurants! The food is amazing, and I've never had to wait long to sit down. The beer list is great too, and everyone on the staff is super friendly. They also have the BEST grilled cheese I've ever had :) 

The back patio area is great for live music, too!! If you ever hear of a local artist playing, definitely come by because it's a really fun spot. They'll even serve you food and drinks on the lawn!"}
{"text":"OMG we LOVE this place! Amazing customer service (we love Justin), great beer on tap, delicious food. You can also buy a beer for a buddy (future use) which is fun."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites places in Phoenix! Our work Christmas party was there, and the food and service was excellent! Definitely suggest going."}
{"text":"Very trendy place. Nice selection of brews. We tried the black bean humus it was good. Pretzels bites were good also. They had all long weekend happy hour. Will return to enjoy more brews soon."}
{"text":"The food was really good.  Everything fresh and delicious. Unusual items that you don't find a million other places.  The beer was nice too (though I will be honest that I liked the guest beers better than the house). But I want this one to be about service.  

Service sucks these days.  You're a commodity to be rushed in and out.  Tonight's manager Jarod was a stand out from this expressionless crowd of hustlers. 

To be clear, our waitress Coly was great too.  Friendly.  Quick.  Attentive.  Appropriately solicitous with her opinions on food and drink selections.

But Jarod bought it home.  He came and asked if I needed a refill on my empty beer 15 seconds after we had ordered a new round.  But after we said we were fine, he thrust out his hand and eagerly wanted to meet us.  This wasn't a drive by.  He was actually concerned about his customers.  And then, barely 5 minutes after we ordered our entrees, he sheepishly came back to the table and I was ready for what is expected.  \"I'm sorry, we are out of what you ordered.\" Happens to me all the time.  Nope.  \"You ordered the pizza right?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well it was made wrong and I'm so sorry.  We are making a new one right now.  On us.  And can I get you an appetizer, on me too?\" No excuses. Honest, up front customer service. And with as quickly as the remake came out, I would've never known anyway.  I had to in good faith decline his offers.  It was really no wait anyway and I was charmed by his service.  But he apologized again later about the wait (when there really wasn't any).  

Kudos to the bosses for hiring people like Coly and Jarod.  

You want service from people who think your good time matters?  Come here."}
{"text":"Fretzy fans from back in day.  Happy to see this restaurant open up.  Some kinks to work out but menu was diverse, location good and varied beer selection.  We ordered the charterie.board and pizza.  Board was unique and really good.  Pizza was ok, my only complaint was that it needed more cheese.  Other than that, looking forward to see this place evolve."}
{"text":"***UPDATE***
 Rich went above and beyond to address my concerns and remedy the situation. Thank you for your honesty and addressing the issue. Looking for to trying Phoenix Ale again on better terms. 


I ordered through DoorDash so I'm most certainly screwed. I ordered two orders of chicken strips and fries. I received a breast battered in salt a dollop of mashed potatoes and a soggy ear of grilled corn. 

QUITE POSSIBLY THE SALTIEST ITEM IVE EVER EATEN. IT WAS OFFENSIVE AND NOT EDIBLE. WHAT WAS I SERVED? Nothing like the description."}
{"text":"This place is so adorable. Great concept. Awesome patio with TVs and a grass area that they use for private venues if needed. They have a program where you can buy a buddy a beer. Buddy shows up and their name is on a board with a free beer on the ready. Love that!  The beer was good (both hubby and I had the King George Amber Ale, Amber Ale, ABV 5.2%, IBU 35). We also both had the cheeseburger. It was ok. Definitely over cooked - definitely med well and then some which made it a little more dry and chewey than I would prefer. Note that they did not ask how we would like it cooked and we didn't volunteer that info either. So we got what we got. We should have specified. The cross cut fries were good. No condiments on table so I asked for mustard and ketchup and they brought 2 small dishes of each. I knew that wouldn't be enough ketchup for my burger and both of our fries so I asked for more and they brought another fuller dish and that was plenty. They had blankets avail Incase you wanted to hang on the patio when it was chilly. Also we were told as we were leaving that they are planning a bbq in two weeks with live music - might need to check that out."}
{"text":"First and last time customer unfortunately. Went in for a quick lunch and that didn't happen. Service was unbearably slow with no apologies. We even asked for our check before we got our food so we didn't have to wait after we were done. We had our check for 20 mins before we got our two salads. Salads... We should have left after waiting 20 to give our orders. There was a large group outside but this was unacceptable. No second chances here! 

Update: I was impressed that the CEO Rich contacted me privately to address my experience at his restaurant. He offered a free meal for my next visit. I haven't been back but will update my review if I do."}
{"text":"The steak and eggs is ridiculous! So delicious! And the bread. Oh the bread was wonderful. I might just stay for lunch. Staff is very friendly with great recommendations. The decor is awesome and they have NFL Ticket so I'll be back on a Sunday. Check it out. A+"}
{"text":"Wow this place just opened and it is fantastic. We were in town for the Giants games. Stopped here on our last day. Excellent options from their own brewery plus some guest brews on tap too. Pretzel bites were tasty and their food was in general great. I was a little bummed that they were out of their Watermelon Ale, but it says a lot that they went through 2 kegs in about 4 days...it must be tasty which means I'll be back on my next visit. Staff are friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable. Love the decor too. It's only been open for less than a week, but I'd say this place will be around for a while. Definitely recommend this place to local friends and those visiting.
UPDATE: just a note to be patient...it looks closed from the front but actual entrance is on backside. So you need to drive around to the back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour.  The beer selection was good...enjoyed the mother Earth Cali.  Food was delicious.  Service at the bar was excellent."}
{"text":"I got the wings and buffalo burger! Both were amazing! I also got the watermelon ale, it is so refreshing on a hot day! The service was great and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Beer connoisseurs know that draft beer is better than bottled beer (unless it's draft beer in a growler). This is an important point, because until tonight, I didn't realize what I was missing. My good friend Bob was in the valley and he was excited to try the very new Phoenix Ale Brewery's Central Kitchen.

I would imagine most valley residents are familiar with Phoenix Ales' variety found in local stores (Fretzy's, Camelback IPA, Keeper!). I've enjoyed them too and thought they were pretty good, but not exceptional. Personally, I like Keeper! best. But my opinion went out the window tonight over two beers. I enjoyed the Orange Peel IPA and a Watermelon Ale with my dinner.

I have a new found respect for Phoenix Ale Brewery! These beers represent my two favorite styles: IPA & Wheat Beer. The IPA's orange citrus wasn't overwhelming, it had a great juniper aroma and the bitterness that lingered on the back of my tongue was an experience. It wasn't going for a knock-out blow on the IBU scale. Rather, it was a solid IPA with a different personality. And then the watermelon... This one hit me in the face. Watermelon isn't a particularly strong flavor, so it's good that the melon flavor isn't subtle. No mistaking the flavors here. It's watermelon and its deliciously refreshing!

I've been rambling and haven't even mentioned the food. The menu here is impressive and upscale. Our Charcuterie Sampler appetizer was outstanding! And our server Vince explained what was house made and other items that were locally sourced. Vince was extremely attentive, knowledgable, professional and friendly.

Add to the mix a cool atmosphere, a nice central patio and generous portions of food and you've got a restaurant poised to make a stand on 7th Street. There are lots of options in this part of town, and I am willing to drive past them to enjoy another meal here. (Just remember the parking is behind the building.)"}
{"text":"Chicken drummettes for starters have a fiery addictive spice, fish & chips are a must (crispy delicious batter on the outside & moist flavorful cod inside), bison burger for protein lovers, Phx Ale beer speaks for itself & mama Toledo eclair pie is a no-brainer!!"}
{"text":"Something for Everyone

A friend and I went to The Phoenix Ale Brewery Central Kitchen yesterday for the first time.  We both ordered  the beer sampler (5 beers of your choice). 

The brews were very good. I really enjoyed the Camelback IPA and the Orange Peel IPA both were freat.  We spent an hour or so visiting while sampling a flight of beer. You can see the brewery from the tasting room. We didn't take the tour, but could see that several people did.

A neat place to go.  The prices are reasonable, and the  service was very good.  Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is absolutely a great place. Amazing food and amazing customer service. I like that it's a little hidden. Not overcrowded. Great vibe."}
{"text":"New in town for sports events and yelped this restaurant.great beer selection as well as wine 
Had the fish and chips, amazing! Nice outdoor patio seating as well. The place is well done, a little hard to find as it is behind the Main Street out front but great setting back there!
Hope to return sometime in the future!"}
{"text":"This place was a great choice to come to with 2 other couples to hang out and catch up. There were 6 of us on a Friday night, so I called ahead to make a reservation - Lindsey helped me out and was extremely friendly and accommodating on the phone. We arrived a few minutes early and our table was already ready.

The place gets very loud in the evening on the weekend, so be ready to sit close and speak loudly if you want to have a conversation. The vibes are so good here though that the loudness isn't really a bad thing.

Their beer selection was great - I'm really glad they had a seasonal rotating beer I could add to my flite, as well as other local beer options. Everyone's food at the table was amazing - I had the Cast Iron Mac with bacon and it was plenty of food to fill me up.
 
I will definitely be back, especially when it cools down so I can check out their patio!"}
{"text":"I have been to Central Kitchen twice now.. The first time our service was definitely lacking, but let's chalk it up to being new and I am sure there were some kinks to work through. Our server seemed extremely overwhelmed. 

Second time. Our server was so great she could have convinced me to order one of everything off of the menu. She was extremely enthusiastic, personable, and very funny. 

The pretzel bites are too good to pass up, we even kept the cheese to dip our fries in and we love the brownie!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! 
The wait was a little long, but I guess that's just 'cause it's so popular. 
A large selection of beer, wine & cocktails. Very flavorful food and friendly staff! 
A great night out with friends!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give a four star rating overall but there is no way to explain how great our service was! The staff here truly works to spoil you and give you a great experience. I'm really sorry I didn't get our servers name so I could shout him out here.

Clearly this restaurant works hard to keep their people happy and it shows! Well done! My husband likes dipping sauces. We let our server know, and he got creative and came back with a plate of five sauce recommendations. It was my birthday and we had brought our own cake. He went and tracked down a lighter for us and a big knife to cut the cake. Little gestures of customer service go a long way! 

Other remarks, the food here is good! A large pizza is enough to feed three or four people. The value here is good. It is a bit confusing to find from the street since you enter around back. They have a great looking patio and I look forward to it being cool enough to sit out there."}
{"text":"A group of us tried dinner here tonight. Love the vibe and not too big so that it is so noisy as many places are these days. We tried the pretzel bites. I wasn't blown away. They were ok. Cheese dip was also not great. Maybe just not my thing. I did like the addition of the caraway seed. Best part imo. Maybe if they were warmer? 
Several ordered the pork shoulder tacos. Mixed reviews on those- the consensus was they were good if you like smoked meat. The root beer made the meat very tender and two of the three liked the smokiness.
The pizza was loved by all. Great flavor and crispy edges from the pan. 
I had the shrimp tostada. It was good but not that memorable. The shrimp needed more flavor. The black beans and peppers were a nice touch and it would have been very blah with out those. 
Overall, we had a nice experience. Our waitress was nice and helpful. We will be back to try a few more items and get a real feel for it. Oh, and maybe try the beer (hottest day of the year and no one ordered an ice cold beer!)"}
{"text":"Coming into town because I moved near here to go to school and decided to check it out. We walked in and the bartender Rosemary was super friendly and explained to us which beers were the breweries, etc. she told us what beers go with what food. The beers are great and the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is pretty spacious and walking distance from other cool restaurants and lounges; great location guess what I'm saying.

For drinks, I went for their flights since finding a right brew can dangerous since I want to keep drinking till I find the right one!  Needless to say, the place has a large round bar in the middle while the atmosphere is very sports bar-like.  

We started with appetizers; the King George Amber Beer Wings.  I found it very plain and basic.  For our entree my partner ordered the Alaskan Cod and Chips while I went for their Calabrese Pizza; house sauce, salami, cheese blend, chili flakes, and arugula.  Overall, the fish were extra crispy atop some waffle fries; great texture and complimentary to our beers.  The pizza was loaded with toppings and served in a square cookie pan, which is unique!  However it worked since the crust had a subtle crunch while keeping the topping moist and sauce juicy. 

In the end, Phoenix Ale Brewery seems pretty chill place and the food seems to be a hit or miss and/or nothing to rave about. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and the food and beer options are delicious and well priced but tonight I mistakenly ordered a vegan chili and the speed and kindness (I was at bratty/hangry mode) to which Mary got me a new version with steak was incredible. The chili was AMAZING and the service even better. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the original Phoenix Alex Brewery a few years ago, so I was elated when the new kitchen opened closer to my home! Beer selection has a great variety... Try the watermelon! We liked it so much we took two crowlers home! The food so far has been pretty tasty, a bit pricier, but fair. We have had the Buffalo burger, an exceptional option, the chicken sandwich with the marmalade is worth a try and the pizza is a great compliment to a cold beer! Looking forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Clean atmosphere, great food, and friendly bartender! We went during the week (on a Wednesday) not crowded at all and quickly sat at the bar. Try the Mashed pizza! The BBQ Bison was good, I got it without mushrooms, and liked it! So yummy!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and the food and service never fail! The food is excellent! If you get the chili, it's HOT! They make it HOT. If you don't like it, don't get it! The fish and chips are AMAZING! The fish is light  and flaky with a crunchy batter! GET IT! 
We had a bad experience with one employee one hour before closing, but the management reached out to us and restored our confidence. Marcos is an excellent!  This one of our favorite haunts in Phoenix. Seriously GOOD!"}
{"text":"Great selection of brews and the bison burger was amazing. I recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a good brew and a good bite to eat."}
{"text":"Have had two amazing experiences here! Figured I should give credit when it is due. Justin was amazing and personable along with Marian! They have made tonight another fantastic evening. Food was delicious and combined with the service made our experience outstanding. Thank you and keep up the good work we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Giving them four stars for now we went for drinks and just had a few snacks fries and Codie's both good. I don't think I can give it a full review without trying more items. The owner rich is super friendly and we will be coming back frequently. My hopes are after trying some more of the food I will be editing this review to 5 stars. Cheers"}
{"text":"New place that just opened up in my neighborhood, we were sat at a booth, shortly after people were sat in the booth behind me... It was like sitting in an airplane with a kid kicking the back of my seat... NON STOP. WTF, u should make sure there is enough room (or padding) so we don't have to deal with this. The food is good, the server, very nice, the beer GREAT...but all I want to do is get the hell out of here, I can't imagine coming back"}
{"text":"I brought a friend here from out of town and she enjoyed the beer selection. The watermelon ale was delicious! Jonny the bartender made great recommendations and the beer pairs perfectly with our food. I shared the chicken tenders and macaroni and cheese with my friend. It was a perfect amount of foods. We went in on a Sunday evening it was nice and quiet. The service was great. Would recommend for a date or catching up with friends."}
{"text":"I love everything about the beer here They have a great local selection and even some of their own. Not many places have growlers you can fill but they've gone a step above a have different sized growlers for some variety. The pretzels are a great start to any meal on their menu! I used to live in walking distance which was amazing."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Phoenix Ale House several times. This new brew spot has a great look. Its a little confusing from the road with the boarded up windows, however they are in the back of this building along with another restaurant. Totally worth the find.
The beer selection is great. Lots to choose from. ..cant make up your mind. No problem. They have beer flights. 
The service is the only reason for the 4 stars. Out of the 2 times we've visited. Its seems they have a rotating server. Always someone different coming by. Im not a fan of this because it can cause issues and delays. Which happened on visit 2. Maybe they just are working out the bugs of being new.
The food was excellent.  We will come back again"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very modern brewery compared to other ones.  Nice selection of beers and very tasty.  I really liked the watermelon ale and the orange Peel IPA those were my two favorite.   For dinner I had the BBQ bison burger, which was just ok.  I didn't think it was worth $15 dollars. Just wished the meat had a little more seasoning on it."}
{"text":"So I gave that black bean burger a second try management kindly reach out to me and let me know that that experience was a fluke! so I said okay well we're going to see! I went back today and that burger was 10 times better it looks better it tasted better everything was amazing not to mention that the atmosphere was so great the service was so great the overall Vibe of that entire place was just really nice it's a really nice cozy friendly place to be... so welcoming... you feel invited you don't feel like you're just going somewhere to eat you feel like you're one of the family!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Plenty of parking the owner was absolutely wonderful! I brought my shelter dog here to get some exposure and he absolutely loved his 2 sides of bacon! We were all in love. I on the other hand had the vegan black bean burger and it was delicious. This is a great place if you love beer, food and a great atmosphere not a single downside and the service was phenomenal."}
{"text":"AMAZING TEAM!
I am in love with the shrimp tostada and can I tell you that the baked potato pizza is out of control! Seriously, the staff is very attentive. The place has a friendly, urban vibe and the wine list is darn good for a place that specializes in beer. My dining companion was tickled to find that they serve Jack Daniels. On my second visit I treated myself to the pretzel bites and the cheese dip curled my toes. I wanted to take a swim in it. Welcome to the neighborhood guys. You've brought a gem to CenPho!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and daughter on a Monday at lunch time. Extremely friendly staff (yay!) Our waiter, Chris was awesome; good personality, communicated when our order took a few more minutes, knowledgeable on his recommendations (well done, management ). Clean, relaxed atmosphere, and delicious food. They offer a $10 deal for another ahuge burger with a beer. Great deal, and I may have to come back on a regular basis for the AMAZING porter beer and fantastic hamburger. The chicken fried chicken strips are a must also! I am always impressed when a restaurant manages to have an environment that accommodates families AND day drinking groups AND couples."}
{"text":"Pros: Great vibe, terrific beer choices if you like craft beers 

Con: Tremendously mediocre pizzas. We had the \"meat\" version and the mushroom/jalapeño version. Literally, there are at least 3-4 significantly better pizzerias within a mile (Federal, Corleone's, Spinato's...). 

So, maybe for a beer and some apps, but that's it."}
{"text":"Another review that I am behind on. This was a couple of weeks ago ...So hubby and I were planning on eating at Okra but they weren't open yet so we decided to dine here instead. Must say that I'm kind of glad because we really enjoyed our meal here. We started off with the appetizer of Pretzel Bites and the they were amazing! The flavor of them all by themselves were enough to make me want to keep eating them but add in the cheese fondue and mustard that they serve on the side -  I would be content with having that as my entire meal. I ordered the special that they had for the day which were the pork tacos and they were scrumptious. The pork was so tender and the toppings add so much flavor. Hubby had The Ale House three meat sandwich that was piled so high with meat and tasted really good. It came with a side of homemade pickles and their cowboy caviar that I could just snack on all day long. Unfortunately I forgot to take any pics so I don't have any to share  Also our waitress (and all the staff) was great and we will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Live literally down the street and was excited to try. Service was awkward. Food was incredibly over priced for how disappointing it was. Ordered the pretzel bites and the cheese was not even cheesy and the mustard was honestly awful and the pretzels themselves were.... Costco-y but with rosemary on top?? I hope that makes sense. Also got the 'skillet mac and cheese' which did not come with the 'pretzel crust' it claimed to have- is that what a pinch of bread crumbs is? Pretzel dust?? Paid an extra $3 for bacon and I kid you not I might have found one tiny morsel of bacon and that's it. Can't believe that they charge for that. Really bummed. Also the table next to use was slurring racist banter. WHAT?!"}
{"text":"Very warm and inviting vibe to this place, as told by the decor, ambiance, staff, and well designed menu.  They also have a cool Buy a Buddy a Beer program where your friend gets a surprise beer the next time they come
in! (probably hacked the name, but you get the gist)

I love the mostly-local beer selection and it pairs very well with the food items. Many of the dishes that you can choose from also have beer incorporated in some way, which makes it even more intriguing. This is definitely not your standard brewpub food.

Recommendations:
Drink-
Watermelon Ale
Orange Peel IPA
Sonoran Pepper Saison

Food-
Olives
Grilled romaine
Guajillo Wings (must try)
Potato pizza (name?)
Fish and chips"}
{"text":"We liked most of the beers. The Biltmore Blonde is now one of my favorite local beers. We had a couple of bloody Mary's as well. The mix was ok definitely had better. Now a days if you're going to advertise your home made mix,  then send it out with something interesting in it. Maybe a piece of bacon or jerky, or some pickled okra. A slice of jelapeno and red pepper isn't very exciting. The food was just alright. Nothing I'd bring someone back to try. We got there at noon on Sunday and had the bar to ourselves. Very cool atmosphere and design. We would come back and drink and socialize, very nice drinking spot."}
{"text":"My husband's love for burgers led us here. They had happy hour going on, but didn't have very many food options with happy hour prices. There was one server who also was seating customers so service was a little slow. Hubby ordered a beer and the BBQ bison burger and I ordered the Steak & Taters. Hubby liked the burger but I took a bite to try and I wasn't a fan of the mix of BBQ sauce and goat cheese. However, my entree was delicious. The steak was tender and juicy and the gravy accompanying the steak was good. I practically ate the whole plate by myself. Portions were not generous - good for one, not for two. I think prices are a little higher than average. Our bill was close to $40 excluding tip. Will we be back? Not sure."}
{"text":"We always love coming here for the chicken strips and beer! 

The bar has great craft beer, plenty on draft and the .perfect selection! 

We really enjoy the chopped salad, chicken strips and pretzel bites! Everything is cooked perfectly and the flavors are always fantastic! Love the beer pairing on the menu too! 

I can't believe we didn't find this place sooner!"}
{"text":"Excellent local beers, great ambiance & super friendly staff.  Spicy sweet pepper jam was fantastic on the citrus orange peel IPA grilled chicken!  Cilantro slaw is creamy & delicious!  Bird City Ale cheese was very tasty with the pretzel bites & I hear it will be on the macaroni!  3 meats burger was perfection!  This place will be in our rotation for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Folks!  This is an awesome restaurant!  This needs to be on your go to, regular, date night, game night, I don't have any food in the refrigerator night place.  

The food?  Outstanding.  The beer?  15 handles of Phoenix Ale Brewery, so none better!!  Give this place a shot and ask for my buddy Rich.  You can even buy your buddy a beer at this joint and put their name on the big screen!

Must try it!"}
{"text":"We saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. What a wonderful surprise. Fabulous food and a fun atmosphere. The staff was fantastic as well. We tried the Orange Chicken sandwich and it was perfect. The chicken fried chicken was also superb. We enjoyed the pretzel bites and our kids all loved their food. What a great gem!"}
{"text":"Stay away from the chicken!!! I ordered chicken wings for myself and chicken strips for my daughter. When I was cutting up her chicken it right away looked and felt rubbery. The wings were the same way. I tried a little of each one to see if it was just one bad one, but all were bad. It was the worst quality of chicken I have had in a long time. I can only assume that it was frozen and then thawed and frozen and thawed again... who knows how many times for it to taste and feel that bad. I'm not one to send food back cause I feel there is no point most of the time.  I am kinda angry with this place! I'm angry that they served such crap meat to me and my daughter. It's a place for beer not food. 

Screw you guys for serving your customers such crap meat!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really cool place with good food and a nice beer selection. The pizza is awesome! Even my picky husband noted that the chicken was really good. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Nice atmosphere  would definitely be back!!! It was our first time so glad I found this place on yelp - had the pretzel starter - fabulous!! 
Then the Mac and cheese sooo yummy"}
{"text":"Our waiter was friendly and efficient. My wife order soup and macaroni.   She ate neither.  We had pretzel bread and fondu. The fondu was tasteless.  I ordered cod and chips.  The cod was good.  French fries are not chips and should not be considered chips, a far fatter potato size. This was our Thursday night new eatery suggested by a friend who lives near the establishment. I eat at a different restaurant every Thursday and write a review."}
{"text":"We stopped at this place because we were looking for a modern, casual and fun place, with TVs for the basketball games, and delicious food, on a Sunday afternoon after a lot of walking in the city.  It met all of our expectations."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite brewery in Central Phoenix! Great indoor space with a patio open to a grassy courtyard. Beers were great and the food even better. My boyfriend ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and although we all really enjoyed our meals we were all stealing bits of his pizza because it was so delicious. You would think only being open about two weeks they would be working out kinks but not at all. Great service, great food, and an overall great addition to central PHX."}
{"text":"The greeter was friendly and our waiter was nice but a bit on the slow side ever though it wasn't too busy. 

This place was a hidden little gem, and we came by for the beer and great reviews! 

We ordered chicken strips and OH MY GOD they were the best chicken strips I've probably ever had! The battle was AMAZING and had a great pepper taste and were so crispy and crunchy- but without any grease! The waffle fries were fresh and crisp and super delicious! We pair both with gravy, ranch and ketchup. 

This will be the only place I come for chicken strips from now on!"}
{"text":"We have been here three times and the first two were on a Saturday night, so I attributed the slow service due to the fact they were busy. However, we came during the week and ordered a salad and pretzel bites and it took 25 minutes for the food to come out. The server was great and friendly and the food is always good, but just very slow kitchen. We will still come back, but just have to remember the kitchen is slow."}
{"text":"Beer is okay, guest beers are better. Plenty of tvs to watch games. Haven't tried the food yet."}
{"text":"Great little spot, Gina bartender is spectacular. Owner is kind and loves his work. Great food, neat little atmosphere priced very fair. Ill be back, frequently."}
{"text":"The pizza is SO good. A generous 10 inch square with some many crunchy edges. The crust is beautifully crispy bot not at all charred. Very much reminded of what I grew up knowing as Sicilian pizza.  Thick tasting crust but thinner than a chain hand tossed. Very much enjoyed the bartender/manager conversation as I was here solo. 
There is still more construction here but from the insode of the bar you wouldnt know. Excited to see what else develops. 
My favorite part tho... nice big drafy beer menu boards are easy to read and list both ABV and IBUs. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Was here last night for a second time. Great place to hangout and food is your typical bar food. Not a great selection of premium vodkas \"kettle one\" was one though. We were seated outside as there were no open tables, and it was a bit nippy, thankfully we had our coats with us  ecause their heaters were not working. I ordered the fish and chips it Flavorful and loved the coleslaw that came with it, but the amount of chips (fries) was disappointing. 

I'd definitely come again and I hope heaters are fixed :-)"}
{"text":"Chris, our server for Sunday brunch, was excellent.

Gave this place two tries. Food took forever...for no reason other than unorganized staff and poor management.

See the pic of a breakfast burrito which was utterly embarassing for poor Chris to bring to the table. That sad tortilla with a smattering of eggs and other stuff might pass as food in Trump's America...but this is real America. This is occupied Mexico! I can get a real burrito in a hundred places within 5 miles from here.

This chef should be embarrassed to even have made this brunch menu. I'm certainly embarrassed to have eaten from it. It is literally as though the person who designed this menu has never been to a place that serves breakfast, or is simply against breakfast as a meal. The 'Cajun Eggs' weren't spicy, the servings were small, the potatoes invisible, the toast is served dry with no option for a spread (jelly, jam, or even butter)...where does this chef eat breakfast?

On a side note, on both occasions eating here I ordered a soda which was dropped without a straw. That's kind of weird.

The regular menu is fine, not great, but fine. The prices are as though you are getting excellent food though."}
{"text":"This place has great food and great beer. Probably the best wings I've ever eaten. Great big tables. I loved everything about it."}
{"text":"We had the ALASKAN COD AND CHIPS. Standard fare and $16.

Second visit we had the ALE HOUSE CHEESEBURGER.

Not bad but not great at $13. Some of it is that the beef used is so lean it has no flavor. Fat = flavor, but people probably prefer healthy.

The pickles are excellent. I love pickles.

Third visit we had BRING HOME THE BACON for brunch at $12.

The bacon was very tasty, I love bacon also, and my companion loved the Wildflower 9 grain.

The fingerling potatoes tasted like leftovers from Saturday.

Hoppy hour every day so worth a try."}
{"text":"Read about this brewery online so decided to try it out. Great venue. Nice selection of beers. Too hot today, but hope to sit on the patio sometime. The bar is horseshoe shaped so it's easy to converse. Very enjoyable time."}
{"text":"The drinks were good, specifically the sour monkey but the food was sub par. It's also pretty small inside so if you go during the winter it could be a bit crowded."}
{"text":"Dropped in to check it out and were so happy. Great dog friendly patio. Comfortable seating and attentive friendly staff and fantastic food. 

Started with the buffalo wings. They were some of the best wings I've had since wings began. The buffalo sauce was very tasty and just the right amount. The blue cheese sauce was very good too. 

I went with the white French onion soup and the steak salad. I've never had white French onion prior to last night but I really enjoyed it. The salad was great. My steak was cooked perfect and then cooled so it wasn't all hot on the lettuce. Yummy

My man had the mac and cheese because if it's on the menu he has to eat it. It was very good. I'd go with light hatch as it was a bit spicy.  Very good!

The brownie and gelato is a must. 

Can't wait to try the tacos. The watermelon ale is a must try"}
{"text":"I love this place! This place is great for dinner! I like the menu- it's like comfort food with a twist. We tried the charcuterie sampler, and it was amazing! We got a couple of pizzas for the table which were also pretty tasty. 

The beer and cocktails are yummy as well. My favorite beer is the Koffee Kölshe. It is delicious. It smells and tastes devine!"}
{"text":"We showed up early after having to put our 15 year old dog to sleep, and it was like they knew. They let us in early and poured us drinks, and took an advance food order, and then asked what we wanted to watch, put it on and let us stare.

Then they brought out the best hummus in the valley, and kept the drinks coming. The service is so amazing, the atmosphere is calming, and this is officially our new favorite place:)

Thank you so much Phoenix Ale House, we really needed you today and you came t"}
{"text":"I had the Atlanyic Cod and my boyfriend had the chicken fried chicken.  Soo much food but absolutely delicious.  The service was fabulous, everyone was helpful, but our waitress, Gina was terrific.  She gave great recommendations and better service.  Such a great girl."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Phoenix Ale. I have been wanting to try it for a while but with so many great new restaurants its hard to fit it all in. I am so glad that I tried this place and I WILL BE BACK! 

Its rare that I try a restaurant and enjoy it so much that I plan to visit again soon. 

Service: great service. Everyone was friendly and professional the our server (I really wish I had her name was great! She was very personable but didn't try to be our 'best friend'. Service was fast, and consistent. I was seated where I could see the door, and noticed that overtime a guest left the restaurant, an employee rushed to door to see them out. This is a personal touch that I find to be very special and its a small attention to detail that separates them from other restaurants. 

Ambiance: the decor was simple but well put together. They did not go over the top and the place is not pretentious. 

Food: We shared a charcuterie board, BBQ bison burger, cast iron mac and cheese and the brownie dessert. All of it was very very good and reasonably priced.  

I WILL BE BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!"}
{"text":"I was coming to spring training for my birthday for a couple of weeknights. I found the Phoenix Ale Brewery Central Kitchen on Yelp and chose it for my birthday dinner based on the Yelp reviews and pictures. We were not disappointed! It was pretty quiet on a Monday night a couple hours before closing but I loved the decor and vibe, and the wait staff was great. The food was yummy; I got the flat iron steak with mashed potatoes and kale. My bf ordered the guajillo wings and they were HOT. Just a warning! I tried the cast-iron mac-n-cheese and they were okay, can't say there was anything that special about them. What really sealed the deal was that the wait staff happened to overhear my friends mention my birthday (between ourselves) and they brought out a free brownie/ice cream desert. I thought that was super sweet of them. The brownie was SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD. Definitely give this place a whirl! The beers were great and they have local picks to sample from. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Easy to get to.  Excellent parking.  Friendly staff.  And they give you coupons!!"}
{"text":"We came here straight from the airport after reading the reviews on Yelp.  The staff was great in making suggestions and being attentive. We ordered the chicken wings which was grilled to perfection and their burger was very tasty.    I will visit this place again when I return."}
{"text":"Yay! A new neighborhood restaurant that got it right. Here's what it's not. It's not overpriced. It's not trendy or hipster or fussy. It's not lacking in creativity or variety in the menu. It's not suffering from clueless service. It is casual and comfortable. The service is friendly and expert. The menu is spot on, something for everyone, well-prepared and flavorful. We tried the grilled romaine salad, fried chicken and pizza. Pub comfort food with little twists here and there. It's a place I'll come back to."}
{"text":"Fantastic feel to the place...great parking, good menu selections & great brews! Maybe a bit pricey fro lunch, but worth it!"}
{"text":"All around this restuarant was spot on. 
I was looking for a centrally located Phoenix restuatant for a group of 10 party for a Saturday night at 7pm. We were originally going to go to The Vig but they were not accepting reservations. After searching a bit on Yelp I came across The Phoenix Ale and Central Kitchen. I read a few reviews which were all 5 stars (no surprise here). When I called to make a reservation the person that answered was so friendly and accommodating. They recommened calling the day of to confirm which I didn't have to do because they ended up calling me. Honestly, we didn't need the reservation because there were plenty of open tables when we got there. It stayed consistant with customers but never became overly busy.

Our party came between 7 and 7:30 even though our reservation was at 7. Our server was great with the fact that we were coming in a different times. She was patient, friendly and constantly checked on us as people arrived. 

We started with drinks and appetizers. We tried their charcuterie board and pretzel bites with cheese sauce. I really enjoyed their pretzel bites. The charcuterie was just okay. 

My friend and I shared their mac and cheese and their grilled cheese. Both were very delicious. Some other items were chicken tenders, chicken wings and fish and chips. All which tasted really good. Pricing is average about $14 a person per entree.

Parking gets confusing... you park in a lot that looks like its the back of the restuarant. The entrance is on the side of the building and the togo side is in the front. We accidentally went into the take out area.

They have some really cool features where you can buy a friend a drink. You write their information on the information card and pay for their drink. Next time they come in they just give their information and you get your drink!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pepperoni black rock pizza and a steak salad. The manager brought us an order of the bacon popcorn because our order was delayed. It was incredible!! Our food was delicious! The port and the IPA were wonderful! Great place! Great service! Great atmosphere! You can't go.wrong here!"}
{"text":"Did you know they have beer here?  Hell YES!  Great selection and the server was a super guide.

We shared the pretzel bites and the steak salad.  Super flavorful.  Ambience is great.  Sports on the tvs... but not too obnoxious."}
{"text":"My husband, our 3 kids and I all ate here Saturday evening.  The service was WONDERFUL.  Seriously, when you walk into a restaurant with 3 young kids, not everyone is thrilled to see you all the time.  Central Kitchen staff was enthusiastic and super helpful--suggesting recommended items to order.  We had the beet and goat cheese salad and ordered the Brewmaster Pizza (along with kids meals).  Our waiter forgot to enter in our pizza and as we were in a bit of a rush he boxed it to go and comped both the pizza AND a desert for us as an apology. The few other times we have had something missed on an order while dining out, we had to alert the server.  But at Central Kitchen our waiter came to us and apologized, took full responsibility, and made it right before we even realized we had been waiting long. The Brewmaster Pizza was delicious that night and the next day as leftovers.  And their selection of draft beers was also wonderful.  We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"tremendous menu!  we had  house beers, appetizers and burgers - all so tasty!  friendly and knowledgeable staff. dog friendly patio. also great happy hour pricing on snacks and beers.   Our 2nd visit  here and look forward to bringing our  friends."}
{"text":"I had an event here last night for 46 people and Central Kitchen was so accommodating! They were absolutely wonderful to work with and the servers were really spectacular.

The beer is fantastic and there's an awesome selection of food and mixed drinks. It's too hot to sit on the patio right now but in a few months i'll be back to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I love the lay out, there's an open feeling inside, it doesn't really ever feel like a crammed bar, even when busy. The Orange Peel IPA is delicious. They also have a killer sour on tap. We started going there to fill our growler. The bartenders have been very professional and kind the times we've been in. Highly recommended it if you're a local brew fan."}
{"text":"Just ate here and gotta say it's just ok.   Had the pretzel bites and they were so so.   Wife had the grilled cheese and tomato soup she thought sandwich was good but didn't like the soup cuz it was chunky.    I had fish and chips which was good."}
{"text":"Being from out of town, this place made me feel right at home.  Great food and even better beer. I had a great time chatting my waitress Lyndsey (sp) throughout her shift, and I enjoyed my brief conversation with one of the proprietors, Rich.  I like what they have going here with local craft food and local craft beer.  Visit here and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We showed up short notice for the Super Bowl party. Had a group of 18 guys in from out of town. They got us all seated and we had the best service. Nicole is amazing, she handled all the food and drink orders. The wings here are truly the best, I mean the BEST I have ever had anywhere!! Pizza is amazing also. We had a great time. If you are ever in the area, or live here. You should make it your regular spot. I know I would!  Five star bar. Craft beers, good mixed drinks. Friendly people. 
The staff is top notch!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times...nice sports bar ambiance with the tvs.   Less than a mile from home, so convenient.  Good beer selection.   Square pizzas are tasty, as are is the 'steak and taters' entree.  Got to go back to try the wings, they look good."}
{"text":"We pretty much loved everything. Good food, good beer, good service. Wu-Tang 4ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer, great vibes, great food. I really enjoyed this place. My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and it was awesome! 31 beers on tap and only one I've tried. I'd highly recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and management and good food! Managment went above and beyond adding extra toppings to my boyfriends burger that were not on the menu."}
{"text":"Two of my favorite gut busting foods are pretzel and cheese and the end crusts of pizza. This wonderful brewery/gastro-pub must have had me in mind when creating their menu. 

Hurray to Bird City Pale Ale cheese fondue and an even bigger shout out to the cast iron square pizza. Crispy cheesy crust with the ingredients spreading all the way to the ends... Mmmhmmm. 

The food here is so good I almost forgot to mention the wonderful local beer selection (thank you PAB). The happy hour is on point and you can get growlers to go. What are you waiting for!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place!!!!! The customer service is outstanding, they are on another level. Now for the food, incredible!!!! Their chef has put together a very unique menu, unlike any other, packed with flavor and plenty of options. As for the beer, well we gifted last Christmas and featured only Phoenix Ale beer at our wedding. Need I say more? 

P.S. they have beer pairing suggestions on the food menu"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Salad and wings were awesome. Beer was cold and plentiful. A good time."}
{"text":"Another great place to go to relax and enjoy a meal, a drink and enjoy some conversation with friends, the weather is beautiful now to sit on the patio also a very nice area, I love the friendly staff and the great food, I have enjoyed the Burger and Fries numerous times, also tried the Steak and Taters, very good. One great place to go on 7th."}
{"text":"Our server was friendly and fast. Our beer flight was amazing! The watermelon ale was the bomb! We had cod and chips and the Mac n cheese both amazing! We will be back!"}
{"text":"A must go to! The service couldn't be better! The staff and management is all really awesome and make sure
you have a good experience! The food is top notch and I haven't had a beer yet that I haven't enjoyed."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of beers and apps. Server disappeared after bringing us 1st order and he disappeared. Had to go to the bar and order more beers. Apps were so so. Bad 1st phoenix restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Would have given them a higher review if there taps were working. Only two taps worked but the orange IPA I tried was good."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio and diverse menu. We sat out on the patio and tried a few of the starters and cocktails. The warm olives were delicious, great cocktails and service was five stars."}
{"text":"I have never tried Bison so I thought this would be a great chance to give it a taste. And I was not disappointed, the Bison BBQ burger was excellent, the combination of the King George amber ale incorporated into the BBQ sauce with the mushrooms and goat cheese on a pretzel bun, wow, what a combo! One of my biggest complaints with BBQ sauce at most places is it's way to sweet but not in this case it was perfect with just enough sweetness. My wife had the chopped salad with shrimp and she also enjoyed it very much. The shrimp were huge and there were a lot of them. She had also tried the King George Amber ale as her beer and enjoyed it too. 

Miles and Mariam our servers were excellent, there when we needed them but not over checking on what we needed. Great service!

The restaurant itself is very nice the interior was well thought out with plenty of room to move through it. We ate out on the patio which was comfortable with a great courtyard adjacent to it.

I was very impressed with this establishment and am looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Okay, this is my new favorite place to eat! We've been there 3 times in the past 2 weeks, even though it's about as far as we can get in our Fiat Electric without needing to stop and charge it up!

They have a Happy Hour between 2pm and 6pm, and the beers are just $3. There's a Happy Hour menu as well and I am addicted to the sliders! The chicken sliders are amazing, but the Pork Belly sliders are to die for. Both are done in title Hawaiian rolls, and are just DELISH! I'm drooling just thinking about them.

We also tried the mashed potato pizza. Quite different, but again, delish. Next time we go, if I can resist the sliders, we'll try the fish and chips.

Did I mention the waffle fries! Wow! :0)

What's really good about this place though is the service and friendliness of the owner and staff. They make you feel welcome from the first time you go there. We will be regulars from now on."}
{"text":"Beer dinner tonight. Beer was okay. Wine was good. Food was disappointing. Small portions. Meat overcooked in several courses. And we've had tastier, more palatable food at...Pei Wei even. Need I say more? Certainly not worth the price."}
{"text":"Brought the family here for dinner and enjoyed it. The bison burger was fantastic as was the arugula pizza. Kids had the brewmaster Pizza and chicken tenders. Also good. If the crust had been a little crispier this would have been a five star rating. The cast iron Pizza pan is a nice touch but I think it keeps the crust a bit soft for my liking. Orange peel IPA was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great environment, awesome brew and the food rocks too. This should be a place to put on your roster of places to check out in Phoenix you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our new favorite spot in Uptown Phoenix!  There is a really good fruity beer that I liked and I'm not a typical beer drinker.  The pineapple ginger drink was very refreshing!  I had the bison burger and bf got the wings.  The wings can be very spicy, but were delicious!"}
{"text":"I had a yummy lunch a few weeks ago here.  In staying with my 'ordering my entrée off of the appetizer menu' tradition I ordered the Charcuterie Sampler with an assortment of meats like capicola, salami and Canadian bacon.  Some pimento cheese, and smoked gouda, some sweet bread and butter pickles, sweet pepper jam, mustard, and grilled focaccia.  My only complaint is that I would have liked a different cheese option to split with the Gouda.  (Maybe half Gouda, half something else...?  It was a lot of Gouda in one sitting.)

For my libation I enjoyed a spicy cocktail with jalapeno infused vodka and blueberries.  I can't remember all of the ingredients in this cocktail or what it was called, but I know it was slightly spicy and I enjoyed it enough to order two of them!

We noticed their 'Buy a Buddy a Beer' board and we really liked it.  We tend to frequent tap houses, bars and craft breweries (that probably speaks volumes about us) and we hadn't seen that feature anywhere else, yet, but we'd like to.

The architecture in here was also cool, in a repurposed industrial kind of way and I liked seeing the bones of the older building reused for this creative new space.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience ever. Management overheard berating staff.. I will not return. Service was SLOW. Food was meh...."}
{"text":"Ok - yes - was very much worth the 15 minute drive. Great beer selection, nice flight of beer. Mix of Porter, IPA  Food was first class - great Beet salad followed by a nice steak n taters meal with some sautéed kale. Delicious.
Bartender Rosemary very knowledgeable, gave good advice. LOVE THAT!!!"}
{"text":"As we pulled up the windows were boarded up as they are just opening this location recently and haven't finished the exterior fully.  After our experience they may as well leave them up with the level of competition that is right down the street! 

One star only because I had to.  Stopped in for a beer and lunch, 20 minutes in and we couldn't even get a water. This after sitting AT the bar as service is usually better at the bar. Not even a water! WTF? Isn't that standard service protocol? The couple seated next to us had a similar experience based on what they were saying to there friends on the phone."}
{"text":"Very nice and quiet outside patio. Dog friendly. They even give out free dog treats. The beer is top notch, and frankly the reason i go there. $4 happy hour for PAB beer. 
I had the mac and cheese pizza. It was very good. Il be back here for sure"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the pimento grilled cheese and Daniel had the fried chicken. Both were phenomenal!!! My husband had a seizure and was convinced on his mothers grave that they swapped two kegs so there's that for what it's worth.  Amazing and we will be back!!! I had the Ballast Point Pumpkin Down and it was so good! What a hidden gem. Justin is great and will walk you through the beer selection! Go here."}
{"text":"As I make my way through Phoenix and all the restaurants it has to offer, this place is on the list of greats! Any place that offers the best avocado toast I've had and a flight of beer is fantastic in my book. I'm also not that hard to please. Good food, good service, and beer variety is a win for me. Oh, and if you order the avocado toast add the egg and bacon. You will thank me later."}
{"text":"The kitchen was absolutely horrible in getting our food out. The manager said they were down an employee but I have no idea why after 30 minutes of wait time the food came out cold. I ordered corn tortillas because it listed them as an option. The tacos came out in flour. I inquired about the corn tortillas, which the manager told me they were hybrid tortillas made of both corn and flour. I'm Mexican and in 40 years of growing up on Mexican food. I've never had a hybrid taco made of both flour and corn. It was pretty clear the tacos were wrapped in flour. After all the waiting and shitty service the manager apologized and comped our meal and gave us vouchers. Only thing is the vouchers expired in a week as if we have no life and must come back within one week to use the vouchers. Absolutely ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"Had our first visit on Saturday night.  Had made reservation and when we arrived, I mentioned it as they were half empty.  I thought it odd that hostess didn't speak, rather showed me reservation list on iPad for me to pick out.  Our meals were good, burger, two pizzas and chicken strips.  Our only criticism was the service.  We had multiple people stop by table, but we waited long periods for drinks, food etc.  Our 'main' server spent way too much time chatting with other staff (don't recall his name - tall blonde).  I waited about 20 minutes for my beer.  I'm sure he forgot.  My favorite for the night was the apple cider... was delicious!  Not sure if we'll return.  Just too many other places to try in this area."}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I went around 5:30 on a Saturday night. The place had a good buzz- a decent amount of people and activity- but wasn't packed. Sat at the bar and were helped by Justin-who was awesome! Very friendly and knowledgeable about beer. Food was delicious, great beer list, and fantastic atmosphere. Free parking outside... What more could a girl ask for?"}
{"text":"This place is ok sub par service.. I work in the food industry I am a chef and I run two different restaurants and it took 35 mins for chicken fingers and fried fish.. I don't like bitching but if they read this please get your shit together!!!! Please..."}
{"text":"This is a simple review on beer and ambiance and service. Since I already had breakfast across the way this was a nice find I would come back to. The presage peel IPA was great and I wish I had another stomach as I saw the food go by .... I'm def coming back on an empty stomach. Great craft brews and guest choices as well. The ambiance is urban industrial with an awesome patio which I will be sitting next visit . Plan to bring my fam when here for TG visit as well. Cheers to the love of social foodies at the weekend."}
{"text":"This one of my favorite places in Phoenix. Solid selection of beer, I'm currently in love with Brazilian black. It's a black ale that starts out malty and finishes surprisingly light and crisp.  The ABV is less then 5, which means I can have another ... right? The food is simple but very well prepared. The mashed potato pizza stands out, give it a twirl, trust me!! The service has been outstanding, and really sets them apart from some other brew pubs I've been to. Oh and their weekend brunch is bomb."}
{"text":"First visit.  It was very \"ok\".  The bartender was nice enough, same with the host.  The decor is pretty cool.. It pretty much ended there.  They were out of several beers on the list.  Service was very slow (as in the time it took the food to come out on a 30-40% occupied room on a Sunday afternoon).  The chopped salad reminded me of a pre-made, boxed salad you would buy from the chilled end cap at Safeway (in both taste and appearance). The romaine was substantially more white tough spines than leafy greens.  The pizza was average, at best.  I would compare it to one of the major chains (Pizza Hut, etc.)   Nothing special here.  I probably would not come back except to have a guest beer if something cool came up on rotation, and maybe then i would try something other than the pizza or salad off the menu."}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere and service are top notch. The servers were very knowledgeable about the menu warm, welcoming and great with suggestions and pairings. Loved this place and will definitely be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The bartender Gina was really knowledgeable of all the beers on tap and really took great care of us. The owner happened to be beside us and he suggested the pretzel bites, which were actually super yummy! Can't wait to come back and bring our friends here. It was so nice and cool inside, it was such a good spot to stumble upon. Definitely check them out guys!"}
{"text":"The guajillo chile wings are to die for. They come with jicama spears, perfect touch and crunch! Pair these with their watermelon ale and you'll be in heaven. I also tried their chicken chipotle chowder, yum! My mouth is watering right now. We sat at the bar, service was great. For beer lovers, this place has delicious craft beer, great food and a nice ambience."}
{"text":"I wanted Phx Ale Brewery to be a go-to destination for our neighborhood but instead it's become something we \"settle\" on.  I'm still trying to come to terms with that because I've wanted so much for it. Heck, I even longed for it all those months I saw the \"coming soon\" sign. The building itself is really cool with its spacious brick/wood combo. And the patio is cute and dog friendly (major plus!). I've had great servers who were attentive and successful at up-selling us on drinks and food items. And although I've only had appetizers, the food has been delicious. (I suggest the blackbean dip and wings!). I'm not even going to complain about the beer really, because there are several great brews on tap and you're more than likely to find something you love.
Butttttttttttttt
I guess it's just the atmosphere - or something in the Vibe  - that I'm missing.  This might be somewhere you take your manila folder carrying insurance agent, or realtor to sign escrow documents vs. a group of friends looking to get rowdy. 

It's the type of place that literally plays Hands by Jewel while you sip your beer and contemplate what the hell you're doing with your life.  (It comes on literally every time I'm in there!)

I feel like every time I go in there the life gets sucked out of me and instead of amping up for a night of beer drinking, I'm just stopping in for a bite to eat. Which isn't fair to a place that I KNOW can do it. I'm not looking for a club - if I wanted that I'd go to the Yard. But its gotta have a little more oomph to it.  They've got most of the equation right!  Modern & beautiful place, Great Beer & Food...Hopefully it will sync for them soon! There is so much growth and competition within a mile radius from Phoenix Ale Brewery that It just needs to figure out its niche, who its catering too and Voila it'll be THE destination"}
{"text":"This place really had great food, but more important to me was their outstanding customer service. They were very helpful with the menu and suggestions as well as any questions we had. This was throughout our questions about the food and the beer selections. On top of that they were not pushy for us to try anything once we said no. I personally don't like IPA's nor certain things in my food. When I told them that they understood and helped me with my selections while leaving that stuff out of that. Overall great experience will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing beer, food and even better service! Came in yesterday for my first time and back again today. I was greeted by the friendliest host this evening and continued to receive happy, informative service while sitting at the bar. I will continue to visit central kitchen as well as telling others to check it out."}
{"text":"Good place to grab some local brews, but wasn't ecstatic about the food. I visited The Phoenix Ale Brewery Central Kitchen for lunch with some coworkers during the week. 

We started out with the Black Bean Hummus with tortilla chips and fire roasted salsa. We ended up eating all of the hummus, however, it wasn't an appetizer we were all raving about. I did like the fire roasted salsa, they should provide a larger serving since it was pretty good. I would probably try something else if I decide to come back again. 

I had the Roasted & Pickled Beet Salad with Chicken. I thought it was overall pretty good, the chicken was aggressively seasoned, which I liked.
It was a little dry, but the flavor made up for it. I wish they cut the beets differently because it was difficult to eat the beets when they are thinly sliced and sticking to the plate. No beets should ever be left behind and sadly... my beets were left.

Coworker 1 had the BBQ Bison Burger and was pretty content with it. He said it was juicy and had a lot of flavor. He wasn't a big fan of the fries though. 

Coworker 2 had the Ale House 3 Meats Burger with chips. He said the Burger was dry and was missing flavor. He asked for a side of BBQ to give it some flavor, but wasn't a fan of the BBQ sauce. 

Overall, I would pick Okra (next door) over this restaurant any day of the week. I asked my coworkers about their overall experience and they claimed it was good and would probably give it another try and order a beer while not on their lunch hour."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff, but food is so-so.  Been here a few times and feel that the value for the portions is not good.  Pretzel fondue was ok, another restaurant not too far from here is WAY better and you get twice as much.  Do not get a salad.  I think \"chopped\" means the lettuce is chopped up.  Mine was not and was literally something I could have thrown together myself.  When you spend that amount on a salad it should be really good and filling.  The other visits I ordered different items and felt the same way, not enough food for the $$.  We eat out at least 6 times a week, have to say they better step up their game with all the other restaurants in the area or they will not last.  Nice atmosphere and great staff though.  Maybe they will improve their food in time.  I hope so..."}
{"text":"The VERY best Brewery/Restaurant we have been to in the Phoenix area.  Great brews & food - prices reasonable.  Hope you are lucky enough to have a chat with Justin Madsen (GM) he shared info on some other places of interest.  We look forward to going back & highly recommended this gem."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and always enjoyed their beers.  I happened to be at another restaurant within in walking distance so took advantage being so close and walked over. I mainly come here for the beer but I have tried the food and it was all good too.   Some of their salads are huge.  Pizza is great.  

 
They rotate many of their beers so there is something to try and something they don't have anymore that is missed, hopefully someday to return.  I can't recall having a beer that I didn't like.  I love their Porter, at 7% alcohol they put it in a smaller glass.  Very full bodied yet smooth.

I went there yesterday long after happy hour and the place was pretty much packed with diners and drinkers, family and couples, groups of friends too.  I sat at the bar and even with the crowd service was good. 

Another thing I love about this place is no mandatory Valet parking!  Yay!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! I enjoyed the watermelon ale, as well as a vanilla-rumchata shake! yumyum! The scampi pizza is irresistible."}
{"text":"Very decent bar style food.  Chop Salad was the best item, excellent.  Churros were light and very good.  Excellent service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"You'd think with it being slow, you would get some pretty decent service... you'd think. 

Food took so long to arrive at the table

Waitress walked away to refill soda, went and chatted with the chef, return with soda 5 min later

Brother ordered a bison burger, she asked what he'd like for a side, he asked what the cowboy caviar was, sounded great so he said \"yes I want that\" , they brought him fries 

When we are all done eating we sat around waiting for the waitress ... went to the restroom , she was on there talking to another employee about \"the fucking hot bathroom with no ventilation\" and \"I didn't get PTO for Coachella and I've been here for a year\" ... you realize you have tables waiting for you right??? 

Gave 80 cash for a 60 something check... waiting forever for her to return with the money... looked over to where she was, she was standing with an employee at the register talking and staring over at us while we waited... yes, I would like my change back. No, I'm not tipping you more than 10


The stars I did give... the food was decent."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 27 stars if I could. 

Google lists their open hour as 10am - it's actually 11am. We showed up an hour early for brunch and the staff saw us and let us in early. We were given multiple beer tasters and told that they'd go ahead and cook whatever we wanted despite not being open yet. Service is amazing here, great beers on draft, an amazing menu, and really cool atmosphere. Can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new and different and stumbled upon this gem!! Great atmosphere, friendly personable staff and the Mac n cheese with bacon..... OOMMGG! We also ordered the orange peel ale chicken sandwich... The flavors were amazing but the chicken was a little small for the sandwich and that's the only reason we didn't give 5 stars! They've only been open 4 days and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Cool place and nice happy hour. We arrived at 3 during the week so it was slow. I had the pretzel bites and a watermelon ale and both were good. Don't remember what my friend had, but she enjoyed whatever it was! The bartender (cool glasses) who's name I forgot ( like my friends order) was awesome. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our Son Michael  & His Beautiful Bride Tracey Were Married Here On March 10th. What A Wonderful Celebration. From Start To Finish Everything Was AMAZING!!! All The Employees Took Excellent Care Of Everyone. With Over 60 Guests Plus An Entire Restraunt Open For Service, They Killed It!!! The Food Was The Bomb!!!! The Cocktails Were Delicious!!!!! The Vision Tracey & Michael Had Was Carried Out Perfectly. Even A Little Rain Didn't Dampen Anyones Spirits!!! Thank You So Much For Making This Special Night Something We Will Never Forget!!! 
If Your Thinking About Celebrating A Special Occasion Here......DO IT!!!! They Really Went Above & Beyond For Us & I Am Postive They Would For You Too!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Phoenix Ale Brewery a few times and have to say it's a bit hit and miss. First of all, the beers and beer selection aren't fabulous. This could just be my personal taste in beer, but I haven't found a brew I love from PAB. They do have some serious legit food (read: their mashed potato pizza which is sooooo good and sooooo bad for you..... the crust and flavors are amazing, I go here just for this pizza) and then they have some food that's a bit disappointing (read: pretzel bites.... for 8$ I should be getting a lot more than 6-7 tiny pretzel nuggets.... I was left with tons of cheese after finishing the bread). Will I return? Yes, most likely.... just for that potato pizza!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out a few weeks ago. This place has a dog friendly patio and great local beers on tap! The watermelon and bubblegum beer are some of there best. The service was good and our dogs received plenty of water thru out the night. I forgot what I had to eat, but it was very delicious and the dogs liked the french fries. I would highly recommend this place any day of the week."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The beer selection is different from all the usual choices everywhere else. Tried the pretzels, pretty good , not at the level like the yard but still tasty. Meat and cheese board was really good, all ingredients on it are local and/or made in house with their beers  I like the rustic layout and all the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Great beer, delicious food, and wonderful service! Will definitely be back. Thanks Phoenix Ale!"}
{"text":"So I saw this place on door dash and I thought this looks kinda cool and they have some nice local brews so let's give it a try. So we had a Friday night chill date. It was fantastic customer service to start very friendly and cool staff. Age diverse crowd also very cool to have something for everyone. We had the bacon Mac and cheese and it was super duper. The mashed pizza potatoes on pizza shut up! It was freakin yummo. We had a few different beers a mother's milk nitro shut the front door that shit was bomb. Husband had two IPA's which he enjoyed. We started with the pretzels and the cheese is liquid delish the pretzels are bread they might be better called bread bites not pretzels. Nice decor decent noise level. Oh ya we had that porter brownie and gelato too and it was pretty good. We definitely had plenty to eat and very satisfied bellies"}
{"text":"The Phoenix Ale Brewery has a great local selection of beer and even some of their own. They also have their own growlers you can buy and get filled.  Remember you have to park around back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Fish and chips as I am trying new things. Fish was great and the waffle fries were really good. The staff make the experience really great. Justin is amazing and Jeff do an amazing job Rosemary is an incredible bartender I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"great food and good beer selection including their own house beers along with guests taps.  only down side slightly pricey."}
{"text":"Great intimate spot in the middle of the best new part of Phoenix.  Good beers (and other), great food and even great root beer on tap for my kid who loves it.  Service is excellent too, with managers making sure everything is good to go.  Bison burger is my favorite along with the chili wings, the grilled romaine, and the chicken fried chicken.  Tons of parking but you need to know it's in back.  Thanks PABCK!"}
{"text":"Incredible gastro pub in the central Phoenix corridor. Excellent beer selection with excellent paired food, plus has a happy hour Monday through Friday from 4 to 6. Very friendly attentive knowledgeable staff that is here to serve and help you. If you are in the neighborhood you should definitely check this place out. I will be back."}
{"text":"First time and WOW, the food was amazing.  There was three of us and we all ordered something different so we could each try multiple items.   I ordered the pork shoulder tacos.   I often don't eat park, but this was a guilty treat, smoked perfectly with tons of flavor and a great portion size.  The others ordered the black bean burger and chicken fried chicken.   I am not much of a black bean burger eater, but it was seasoned perfectly, though slightly mushy texture for my liking.   The chicken fried chicken was also seasoned perfectly and I would eat it without question.  Prices are reasonable for the food.  The beer is just a bit overpriced, bit very good.   Our service was exceptional and I am particular on service, 6 stars easily.   If you haven't been, treat yourself and go."}
{"text":"The service and staff is by far the best part about this place, great great service my server Jonny was literally amazing! I also had the macaroni and cheese which has the perfect blend of super cheesy and a little spice, chicken strips were good as well, the bar is super hip, and trendy love the idea of the screen where you can buy a buddy a brew"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. They've got a good mix of Phoenix Ale taps as well as guest taps. Nice mellow vibes with a friendly staff. Plenty of TV's that have games on which is nice. The chile wings are great but the pizza is what this place is all about. It comes in a black iron pan which makes the crust perfect. It's not deep dish, not thin crust, somewhere in the middle. Great beer, great pizza, what else is there?"}
{"text":"Great new find. Sort of tucked away off of 7th street but once you find it and their huge parking lot, you can't forget. Great hosts, service was excellent. Beer selection is very good. Birthday Suit and Orange Peel IPAs were our favorites. Loved my fish n chips, came with waffle fries. I am a bit if a fish n chips snob. These were nicely battered and fried, not greasy at all. Tried the chicken sandwich as well. Was tender and flavorful, just wish it had other toppings to add more texture. Overall,  I really like this place!"}
{"text":"Definitely not ordinary Bar Food. Finally a Brew Pub that put as much effort into the food as it does the  beers. I have visited several times since they arrived and must say the Uniqueness and Freshness of the food draws me back. Two of my favorite menu items have to be the GUAJILLO CHILE WINGS & the BREW MASTER pizza. Another must try is the Coffee on Tap; nitrogen-infused coffee: roasted, blended and poured straight from the keg. Service is extremely attentive and friendly! The dog friendly patio and ice cold water are a plus!"}
{"text":"Nice place to go for happy hour and to catch a game. The chili and the wings were pretty good. Nice to taste the samples before deciding on a selection. Service was great, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Uuu the beer selection is of fine wine status. Super uncomfortable bar seats but nice staff so it evened out. Nice patio outside with sun protection. Only had drinks but food smelled delicios. Will go back for the beer selection."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food!!  Me and my husband shared chicken fried chicken and the fish and chips and omg!! The best ever! I will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent beer, excellent food, excellent service. You can't go wrong!!!! We got the charcuterie plate and 3 meat burger...fantastic choice"}
