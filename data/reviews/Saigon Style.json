{"text":"The food was just meh. We had Pad Thai. However there was no tofu, and we thought that they didn't make it with authentic noodles. Plus the chicken tasted like BBQ chicken and there were very little peanuts. None of the ingredients were really correct. 

The service was quite slow. I.e. We had to get up to ask for more water. And the server slammed down our plates, without taking the appetizer plates first. To top it off, the table was sticky. :("}
{"text":"This is a Vietnamese restaurant.  When we walked by, it looked like a busy, modern, and clean (!) space  inside so we thought it'd be a good bet.  Everything on Rue St. Catherine is tourist-y so we were trying to find some authentic eats.

The menu is in French and English, and there were also pictures to help you order.  There's a good selection of soups, rice platters, appetizers, and drinks.  I ended up getting a rare beef pho and husby got a bbq ribs rice plate (very similar to Korean bulgogi).  We both had combinations; mine came with a few imperial rolls and his came with a small cup of soup (same broth, I think, for the pho).

When the food came, they were a good enough-sized portion.  I felt like I probably could have eaten more, because I'm used to huge sizes at my local pho place.  What I was disappointed with were not enough garnishes.  They had half a handful of bean sprouts and literally 3 leaves of basil.  There was no jalapeno and no hoisin; though they did have Sriracha and Kikkoman soy sauce.

Husby loved his bbq ribs rice plate and ate it in no time flat.  I know him though- he could have eaten double the portion and still would have been hungry.

This was a decent stop to eat and fill up our tummies a bit before going to explore Montreal some more on foot.  If you just want a simple bite to eat, and you want to eat lightly, this is where to go."}
{"text":"I'm salivating just thinking about this place! So i'm keeping this short and to the point. Food is DELICIOUS, everything my boyfriend and I have tried was great. BEST Imperial Rolls in Mtl that either of us has had. The food is all super tasty and filling, but doesn't leave you feeling disgustingly full after, it's all light and fresh! Service is very friendly, i've never had to wait too long for my food, the restaurant itself is clean and modern looking, and best of all it's all at a great price! :)"}
