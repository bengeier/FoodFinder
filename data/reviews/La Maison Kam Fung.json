{"text":"It was definitely good food. But the price was really off putting. Rather expensive compared to other dim sum places I have been too."}
{"text":"It was ok- trying to get service for drinks was the longest.  Extremely warm in restaurant"}
{"text":"Dim sum place, the food is awesome. This restaurant is very popular. It can sit a lot of people and it's always packed on weekends. This in itself says it all. Never tried something I didn't like. My favorites are sumai, chicken feet and fried calamari."}
{"text":"Definitely the best dimsum in the Montreal area and no resto comes close. Definitely try out the regular shrimp and pork dumplings, shrimp and beef rice rolls( cheun fun), fried shrimp dumplings, deep fried seaweed seafood rolls. If you are on the adventurous side definitely try out the braised chicken feet, honey comb beef tripe, or braised tendons.  This place loses one star due to their service, dim sum ladies have a bad attitude."}
{"text":"The first review i've ever written, and it goes to Kam Fung. Probably one of the fucking worst Chinese dim places i've ever tried in my life. I've eaten from several Chinese dim sum restaurants bur Kam Fung is on a whole new level of disgusting. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Waitress's attitude puts me in a wax. They were FUCKING RUDE!!! The chinese lady who brought our check, she was horrible!!!! She was asking for the tips, yelling to me with horrible english. I tried to talk to manager at the front. All the workers said yu no manager or supervisor. That was bullshit!!! Their food was horrible, never have eaten such disgusting Dim Sum in my life. I WISH I COULD NOT GIVE A STAR!!!!! Save your money.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good dim sum , all prepared in like baskets carried around on carts. No waiting time for food :) good variety. The siu Mai was large and meaty. Service was fair but not exceptional. Seems packed on a daily basis from 11-1 for dim sum and 7-8 for soupper. Would recommend to friends, at least they seem to be clean and organized. Also Kim phat is next door so that attracts a lot of Asian customers as well. It is situated next to the highway for the 10 est and west so it's very convenient. I wish they served bubble tea but they don't :("}
{"text":"First, I thought this place was a buffet style, it's not, and you don`t go there for the decor. Its a huge open hall with over 100 round tables and 2 huge golden dragons in the background.  You go there for the amount of food that is placed on your table. We had our 2 kids (12 and 14) and we ordered 2 menu to share for 2, it was menu A and the Peking Duck dinner for 2. I can tell you that we had way too many plates on the table. It comes with dessert, not sure what it was, since they never served it. Oh we did get 4 Chinese cookies. We took home a huge doggy bag. The food was good and tasty.  Yap, I'll go back."}
{"text":"We are regulars here (because we live in the neighborhood )for dinner and the food is predictable and decent, but not over the top good. 3 times out of 4, we have horribly long service. I've never tried the dim sum though."}
{"text":"A very good place for dim sum. I would argue that it is at the time of writing this, the best dim sum in town. Clean tasting, fast trolley rotation and good variety. Above all, a clean tasting dim sum, which I cannot say I experienced so far in montreal.  I measure against kowloon grand in hong kong which was almost a spiritual experience with choice teas and huge stir fry varieties to boot. This place gets busy on the weekends so expect a wait of 10-30 minutes. There is a good asian market next door so one stays with number and the other shops. It's worth the wait.  favourite thing here is the steam rice with ribs and the fried seaweed roll."}
{"text":"Today was our second trip to this dim sum.  First time we liked it very much.  Today we made a special trip to Brossard from Montreal for lunch.  After being seated we waited almost 10 minutes for tea and dipping sauce to arrive, and only after I asked.  When it did arrive, paltry amount of chili sauce and a dollop of mustard, both in the same little bowl.  My husband likes hot mustard, unable to get anyone's attention, he went up to the 3 waiters who were just standing around doing nothing and asked for more mustard.  Was begrudgingly given a small dish of it.  Got an order of eggrolls, that came with a vinegary sauce.  We asked a waiter for some duck sauce.  When he failed to return, we asked a female hostess for some.  She returned with a small portion of watered down sauce.  Subsequently, the waiter returned with a duplicate duck sauce.  When he saw the other bowl there, he took his back saying, \"Only get one.\"  How cheap!  Egg rolls were greasy and overcooked, so even the watered-down sauce did not help.  We ended up getting only 3 other dishes (all of which were cold to lukewarm), since most servers just walked right past our table, without stopping to ask if we were interested in what they had to offer.    To top it off, a woman who just finished refilling water glasses at the table next to ours came to our table and dumped what was left in her pitcher into our pot of tea.  NO LIE!  Did not know whether to laugh or cry!  Finally just paid the bill and left - still hungry.  When I tried to report these issues to the hostess and the manager, no one was the least bit interested.  Will never return."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from this place before and have eaten there many times. A little pricey for Chinese food but the flavors are good. You can't really find authentic Chinese food here in the south shore so we have no choice. The last time we ever went back was when we found a huge rubber band in our won ton soup container after someone mentioned the soup had a weird taste. I'm not talking about a small rubber band used to hold veggies or what a girl uses to tie her hair. I'm talking about a big thick red one you would see around lobster claws. How the hell it ended up in our soup and no one saw it, I will never know."}
{"text":"Not the place for dinner. Took a long time to get our food, the waiters was rude. You better go for the dimsum brunch . Less hassles and almost self serve."}
{"text":"AWesome, delicious food!  I would dare say this was better than our usual experience in Chinatown downtown.  Food was very fresh, tasty, hot.  The staff were friendly (which is a change from other dimsum spots in the area). All in all, a very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome Dim Sum. Always packed. During the week I've been here worth people from work. It's worth the drive across the bridge besides, it's quick and super easy. Food is fresh! This is pretty much the only place I'll eat squid that's not fried like calamari,  it's super fresh and tender almost melts in your mouth. Been here on Sundays too but you have to get here early otherwise there's a lineup to get in."}
{"text":"The waitress forget to order our food to the kitchen,  waited for 1:15 for the first out of six plates. Returned the chicken sweet and sour,  too hard and couldn't see the chicken but flours, no bowl,  missing napkins and on and on.  The waitress didn't bother to see us to apologize,  serving desert or giving us the bill.  In fact we waited for 15 minutes for the bill before asked them directly from the front cashier.  Only 1 of the 6 plates were decent. Will go to Chinatown instead for the future."}
{"text":"Bonne bouff...dans le bruit cocaphonique...mais cela fait partie de l'espérience...pour le beunch du dimanche attender vous entre 30 et 45 minutes..Mais cela vaut le coup...."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Montreal, my family always ends up here for lunch first. Since it always happens on the weekends, there would be a massive wait time to be seated.  When we arrived, we quickly went into the restaurant to get a number and I say it took about 30 minutes until we were seated.  After we were seated, we looked around for the usual dim-sums: ha-gao, egg tart, congee, noodles and fried crab claw. In less than 3 minutes we mostly had everything we wanted. Then, we ate!  The waiters and waitress are all mostly friendly except for a few who had a sour face on... We got in and out of there quickly because we wanted to spend the rest in Montreal but this place is a good dim sum place for anyone and anybody who has never tried dim sum before and want the basics.  Would come back again! But at earlier times to get seated quickly."}
{"text":"Dim sum assez authentique parmi ceux à Montréal. Grande variété de choix avec service amical. Sauf que plusieurs de leur serveurs ne parlaient pas français. J'ai vraiment aimé comment ils ont gardé la veille tradition de dim sum c'est à dire encore des madame qui font la tour des tables avec les chariot. C'est quelques à faire POUR vivre une expérience typique. LE prix est correct, MAIS à chaque que j'y vais ils rapetissent la grosseur du plat ou la quantité de nourriture."}
{"text":"We went there on Dec 24,2015. There was a wait. I order Peking Duck for 40.00$. I order a bottle of wine for 22$. The food cake out and I couldn't believe all the food we were getting. I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for the last 4 years. It is the best in Montreal for authentic dimsum served every lunch time. Cantonese style chinese and their main course dishes are excellent too. The restaurant is also very clean and well maintained compared to most other chinese restos in Montreal.  Only negative is the service is generally slow and waiters can come across as a little rude but that is common in all chinese restaurants.  Favourite dishes:  all steamed dumplings, general tao tofu, vegi chow mein, ho fun noodles with black bean sauce..oh and parking is free and easy.  Tip: on weekends the line up for dimsum can be up to 1hr. Get there by 11am and it is generally 10mins."}
{"text":"Great dim sum! Lots of tables but there's also a long waiting line on weekends. Good variety, service isn't great though. The waiters barely come to your table so we sometimes eat our whole meal without having been able to order something to drink..."}
{"text":"An excellent  dining experience.. My boyfriend and  I first found this treasure   during Christmas week of 2015..There  wasn't much opened..My boyfriend was already a  big fan of  decent  Chinese  fare.. this restaurant  far exceeds  that  rating. We dined there  several more  times that week . So to celebrate  my birthday we went  back and  tasted several different  dishes  ..they served a  large  pot  of delicious tea  with our  evening  meal.. They have a  very extensive  menu...in English, French and  Chinese.. they also have a  fine  wine  list available  ..Our  selections  this time was the  pork dumplings, a birds  nest  seafood salad and  a  pork dish ,,sliced slender  and  served with a  spicy and  crunchy onions  and  peppers..also small dish of  rice  to complement  the  pork dish. mmmmm."}
{"text":"The place is bustling with people. A great dim sum experience in montreal, with very tasty food. Prices are pretty decent, and is great for groups of people, as well as solo."}
{"text":"Pretty much the only place for dim sum in the morning! A bit pricy but the food is well worth it! I love their Cantonese noodles! I really like having diner here! Food is amazing and not too pack or too loud! Very enjoyable here! The only negative thing is during super time some waiters are not friendly and complain in your face if you don't tip them adequately!  However, I can't say all waiters are like that there since I encounter a few that are pleasant and friendly!"}
{"text":"I set my expectations pretty low based on what everyone told me about Montreal dim sum and also being from Toronto. Even so, I left Kam Fung disappointed.  I'm not sure if it was an off day, but there was just very little food coming around in the carts. That was the biggest problem. My girlfriend, her parents and I were just looking around eagerly awaiting food. The rest of the restaurant also looked the same.   The service was also pretty slow. No one really came around to refill tea, pick up empty containers or even to get the bill. Granted they were busy, but usually these popular dim sum places are a well-oiled machine. Not so here.   The food was also just okay. I found many of the dishes to be cold or way too hot. The jia leung (rice cruller) dish was a bit small, but tasted good. The fun gor and siu mai were okay. I was very thirsty afterwards, so I suspect generous use of MSG here.  Overall it was an okay dim sum place to get your fix, but I would try other places in town before going back."}
{"text":"Hmm, I really have mixed feelings about this place.  On one hand, the food is exceptional, huge portions, fair pricing, and the environment is really neat. The service is prompt and they refill the teapot fairly often.  On the other hand, the chariots rarely pass in front of my table whenever I'm seated near the entrance, especially the ones with the congee and the chow mein, two of my favorite dim sum dishes. They arrive when I'm already stuffed with other goodness, and then I order them nonetheless and eat until I have stomachache.  Please, ask to be seated near the windows or deeper in the dining room, you'll get more varieties of food in less time. Also, if you come in during the weekends, make sure to arrive before 11am, or endure the long, torturous wait."}
{"text":"We came here for a New Year dimsum while we were in town. The entire experience reminds me a lot of my childhood's family dimsum experience, I felt like I just stepped out of a time machine and went back to 20 years ago. It's located in an older building. There was already a pretty long line when we arrived so we had to sit by the front for our queue number to be called out before we could go inside to our table, which I believe was just 10 minutes or so. We ordered our standard dimsum items from the menu on the table and from the carts that they pushed around the restaurant: shrimp har gow, shu mai, shrimp dumplings, shrimp rice roll, noodle, and mango pudding. And they all were pretty tasty. Staffs were quick. Our experience was nothing special, all pretty standard but did bring back the nostalgia from my childhood memories."}
{"text":"Dim su  souvent et c'est excellent  Ce soir nous avons soupers,  un samedi soir.  Service excellent.  Plats généreux et très bon.  General Tsao goûteux.  Woonton noodles parfait.  Brocoli xhinois et boeuf WOW!  House fried rice Top niveau.  Le half peki  duck viends en deux service.   Surprenant car nous avions mangé la peau croustillante avec les crêpes quand le deuxième service est arrivé avec la partie VIANDE du canard...  Qui était tendre comme je ne l avais jamais eu avant...  Merci Kam Fung."}
{"text":"Best in Montreal. Recently relocated from west coast. This certainly is better than current number 1 rated in china town. Only missing some key items traditional items, shantow lo mei fan, fu pa goon etc.  I suggest they get a cart to fry some dished directly at table like lo bo gao, Yu to gao etc. Try it you will like it"}
{"text":"I happen to know the owner of Kam Fung, and it must be said, the Kwan family had been in the Chinese restaurant business since the early 90's. It's a family bus through and through, Mr. Kwan's daughters have taken over the business and are carrying on the family tradition, I'm really pleased to see that.  Unfortunately my last visit wasn't particularly up to standards. The service was pleasant and friendly as usual, but the quality of the food was noticeably lower than what I am accustomed to at the chinatown Kam Fung over the last several years.  When Kam Fung Brossard opened, I remember the food quality was excellent and the place was always packed. Such was not the case on my last visit for dinner.  I hope this was a random one time occurrence, and the standards go back to what they were."}
{"text":"Came here alone for Sunday dim sum. =jackpot. Still a long wait for seating but once I got seated the servers took care of me like fruit flies to light. I loved it! got to try authentic dim sum and leave happily with good service. Solo dates yes please."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to eat there. It was later than regular lunch hours so unfortunately the dim sun hours had just ended. We ordered from the regular menu and the food was delicious and the portions very generous. The only thing to not have a 5 stars was the food being a bit salty so next time I would ask the chef to be lighter on the salt.  Definitely will go back and I recommend"}
{"text":"Very nice salt and pepper sea food. Love the General Tao and Ginger Chicken. Chow Mein with crispy noodles is terrific."}
{"text":"Indéniablement le meilleur rapport prix-qualité-goût en terme de cuisine chinoise sur la rive-sud. En groupe c'est particulièrement appréciable de se retrouver là autour de ces grandes tables rondes où on vous laissera tranquille durant tout le temps que ça vous prendra. Le seul bémol c'est que ça peu être passablement bruyant là dedans par moments c'est pourquoi, autant que possible, j'y évite les heures de pointe."}
{"text":"I would be more of an early person if I could eat here everyday! Their dim sums taste like no other place and it's simply amazing. You should go there around 10am on busy days (on weekends especially) since there's always a big line up during lunch time."}
{"text":"This is as top-notch (surrounding) Montreal can get with Chinese food.  The quality and quantity of food served here is excellent.  This is authentic Chinese food (I have no clue if they serve general tao though...If they do, thumbs up for trying to cater to clients with a North American palette).  Where do I start with my review?!  Dim sum: The best.  It serves all traditional dim sum choices.  You've got the grease that comes with the fried foods, the melt in your mouth first bite out of a steamed bun, and the slippery texture from the more \"exotic\" choices i.e. tripe....Because you know there's no other way to do dim sum! Yes, as the other reviewers advise, it does facilitate making better food choices if you and the server pushing the carts speak the same language, but, do consider that the WAITERS/WAITRESSES and busboys speak fluently in Eng and Fre.  The wait staff is friendly for the most part and even make (corny) jokes with you...Even if you are not Asian!  Feel free to gesture to the nice lady pushing the carts to show you what each of the items are.... They'll uncover the steam trays and you'll forget the language barrier anyway...you're here for the food!!! Nom nom nom nom!!  Dinner service: Yes, they are open for dinner service, people eat here for more than the dim sum, y'know!  Once again, spectacular food!  The menu is extensive but that's what you want!  This is authentic Chinese food folks!  Just consider that this place has built a reputation as a highly sought after wedding venue (it's absolutely gorgeous inside with a large chandelier, clean white walls, grandiose space and can accommodate hundreds of people).  Being said, come summertime, expect the restaurant to be a) completely closed for a private wedding reception b) be partially opened...Half the place may be sectioned off for a private party and so the remaining space is business as usual.  As was my experience last night...An 80th celebration was going on.  It was quite entertaining... even though it was sectioned off with a curtain in the middle of the resto, you hear their speeches and music.  We got a glimpse of a Lion Dance... but, it was to the tune of J.Lo's \"Let's Get Loud\" ...There was a line up to get a table and to accommodate more guests, they set up a makeshift table at....the entrance .  Overall, even if a visitor to Montreal or surroundings, it is worth to take a cab here from downtown if you want satisfying Chinese food."}
{"text":"I don't know...I feel like all dim sum places in Montreal taste the same, including this one. Must be just me, though I am no dim sum expert. Anyhow, this one seemed decent. Ate here with my bf and his mother and the experience was interesting. We decided to share a table with 2 other groups because we were just starving from waiting. It was extremely busy at the time we came, and we just wanted to eat. The hostess accepted our request and put us at a large table with 4 other people. She was very pleasant.  Now onto the food! The har gow was not heavily stuffed with shrimp, rather it was smaller in size. I noticed that some dim sum places make extremely large har gow...too much shrimp like it's overkill. The flat shrimp pancake rolls were slightly on the dry end, and this happens to be my favorite dish. Bummer.   Overall the food was decent, service was ok except they messed up the bill making us pay 15 dollars more than we should have. Thank goodness my bf and his mother rechecked the bill!  Come here for dim sum if you're in the brossard neighborhood, it's fair priced and acceptable. Also the establishment holds a  lot of people, so it is quite spacious."}
{"text":"L'endroit est idéal si vous invitez 500 personnes au mariage de votre fille qui marie un Chinois. Mais à part ça, il n'y a pas grand intérêt dans ce vaste, très vaste restaurant où l'on y sert une cuisine bien ordinaire et quasi industrielle tellement il y a du monde, beaucoup de monde. Je passe."}
{"text":"I am used to order Dim Sum dishes through a menu with pictures. I do not speak any chinese dialects and getting what I want was abit difficult. I had to ask the pushing cart ladies to show what they have.   Prepare to wait awhile for a table. The fare is as expected. Good, nothing far from the usual."}
{"text":"They have a large selection of Dim Sam. Service is fast and the price is quite reasonable. We really enjoyed it. As good as it gets for Dim Sam!!"}
{"text":"My best dimsum place :) Crab claw cake is good but the shrimp with green onions fried dumplings are to die for Service is good and food is super fresh"}
{"text":"3.65 rating.  Was okay, they mainly have carts, very spacious and big. The fried calamari looked good but didn't taste as good bc it had been sitting out too long..yak. That ruined my appetite so do not get it unless it's fresh. Other than that, I did enjoy the other things like the egg tart, shrimp dim sum, and cheong (shrimp rice wrap)."}
{"text":"Good food with so-so service; unless you are with Asians. Horrible to say but it is the unfortunate truth."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum place and Chinese food restaurant in Montreal/nearby. Generous portions, affordable price, usually friendly staff and the food is GREAT. Go for the seaweed fried rolls, the fried squid, the shrimp fried dumplings, the Rice with pork spareribs and the general Tao if you are there for lunch.  For supper try their salt and pepper( insert your choice of pork, shrimp or seafood), ginger beef, fried shrimps and chicken mayonnaise ( ask for mayonnaise on the side).   Meilleur restaurant de Dim Sum / Resto chinois a mtl et aux environ. Les portions sont hyper généreuses, les Prix sont ridiculement bas, le personnel est générallement très courtois ( La plupart parlent en Français en plus de l'anglais). La nourriture est SUCCULENTE. J'y suis accro depuis ma première visite et ma famille fait souvent le déplacement de Quebec pour manger à cet endroit."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese I have ever purchased, we trashed it all it was totally inedible a waste of $59. So I hope to warn others before you waste your money. The order arrived over 30 minutes late. The vegetable rolls were greasy and soggy took 1 bite and spit it out. Sweet and sour pork was 17. and didn't come with rice or anything and the pork tasted rotten, trashed it. The fried pork dumplings were not even browned and were disgusting. The hot and sour soup was just sour and nasty tasting 6.95 for a small serving. 7.tip and no apology for being late."}
{"text":"S'asseoir entre amis autour d'une grande table, dans le partage et la joie de se retrouver, quel bonheur! Et ca ne coûte pas très cher pour un \"repas familial\"! $288 plus taxés plus pourboire pour 11 personnes, c'est $35/chacun pour une soupe, un plat de poisson, crevettes, pétoncles, homard, buf , poulet, canard de Pékin, riz et nouilles et dessert! Accompagné de 7-Uo, Coke (LOL!!), eau et the! Un vrai délice pour les sens!"}
{"text":"Typical dim sum restaurant with a decent variety of dim sum. The only gripe is the service, we had to flag people down on multiple occasions to pick up empty dishes when we were done with everything.   I'm from Los Angeles so it was interesting to see how they served different types of dim sum. They had meat and rice bowls that resembled clay pots, but they were definitely lack luster in flavor.   They had carts filled with a variety of different fried foods and noodle dishes you can order by the small plate. The food was ok, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Chinese restaurants with traditional Chinese foods in montreal area. If you have a celebration and want to have family style Chinese and you want a decent meal then this is a good choice besides the Kam Fung in Chinatown and Ruby Rouge. If you are serious then the Papa Resto in Brossard and Heung Ma Ma is a better choice.  We got the family style with six dishes. The chicken was alright but the beef and the eggplant hot pot was quite salty. The lobster was good. The steamed fish was a bit fishy taste so not sure how fresh it is. The vegetables were the best. The rice was taken from two bowls apparently and part of it was really soft like congee. When we asked for it to be changed, the waitress came out with another bowl sitting on too of ours!;(  The dessert was the red bean soup which was fine. They allowed us to bring our cake in and that was nice.  Overall a fun experience with the servers singing with us!"}
{"text":"L'endroit est immense à l'intérieur et décoré correctement. Pour le service, il y a du personnel qui se promène de table en table avec des charriots remplis de nourriture. Si vous ne connaissez pas la place et que personne ne vous explique le principe, vous risquez d'être déçu, comme ce fût le cas pour moi. On nous apporte à une table, jusque là c'est correct. Ensuite, on nous laisse le menu, c'est correct aussi. C'est là suite des choses qui se complique.   Il y avait de quoi au menu qui m'intéressait, mais ceux qui passe avec les charriots de nourriture vienne nous voir et nous propose plein de petits plats. Je me dis, pourquoi pas. Je prends un plat, pis un autre et un autre. Ensuite, lorsque je veux commander à partir du menu, on me dit que vue que j'ai commencer avec les plats servis aux tables, je n'ai plus accès au menu.  DÉCEPTION total à ce moment là. Le personnel ne parle presque pas français et très peu l'anglais. Donc, lorsque je voulais savoir ce que c'était tel et tel plat, les réponses étaient pas mal difficiles à comprendre. Un peu frustré, je demande à quelqu'un du personnel de m'expliquer un peu. Elle me redonne un menu et quand les dames passaient aux tables, qu'elles mentionnaient c'était quoi le nom du plat, je regardais le menu et pouvais mieux comprendre c'était quoi.   Au final, le prix est raisonnable, les quantités à bien du sens, mais la qualité de la nourriture est très moyenne. Je trouvais que toute goutait presque la même chose et ce n'était pas un des goûts les plus agréable en bouche."}
{"text":"Great dim sum in the Montreal suburbs.  Our first visit, got there before they opened, got a table right away.  Placed was packed with a line out the door within 30 minutes of opening.  Always a good sign!  Good variety of very well prepared items:  sticky rice, pork shumai, shrimp dumplings were all terrific.  We had several steamed items, no fries items were out until after we were full.  I noticed they were carting a steam chafer with lo mein, thick and thin noodles, it looked good.  Service was slow, not enough servers for the amount of patrons.  Good value for the money.  Will definitely visit again, as it's the closest we can get to dim sum from our home."}
{"text":"Worst dim sum I have ever had in my life. Stay away! One of my fellow yelpers mentioned that she sat outside the restaurant to cry after the meal because it was so bad; it was no exaggerated. Some of the meat items did not taste like they originated from animals."}
{"text":"This review is for Kam Fung, located in a suburban shopping center in Brossard and outside of Montreal. The restaurants have the same name, but are confused on reviews posted on Yelp. We ate dim sum here on a Sunday. Arriving at 10am is key as the parking lot gets super busy with shoppers at nearby Kim Phat and people eating at the restaurant. It is a big banquet hall and dim sum is delivered via carts. The overall quality is good and satisfying for someone craving the typical fare. The servers were considerate and the facilities were clean. We would come back here if we want to skip going into Montreal."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. Had me a soup and some dumplings for a late dinner, not to mention some cheap wine.  Service is a bit frantic here, as this is a very large restaurant with wait staff milling about like the ghosts in Pac-Man. Sometimes it was hard to flag someone down, but perhaps only because it was getting late, and they were more focused on cleaning up than serving food.  Just -1 star for one thing. I had the wonton soup, and the peanut butter dumplings. The two dishes have the EXACT same dumplings in them! A shimp-filled gyoza type. Now don't get me wrong, these were very good dumplings, but having two iterations of pretty much the same thing was a little disappointing... the waiter could have told me what I was getting into.  Still, a very good and filling meal, and not too expensive. Considering I'm a Chinese Food snob, that should speak volumes."}
{"text":"I love everything about Dim Sum except waiting for the table. The prices here were very reasonable but the service wasn't on point. My mumzy is very knowledgeable in the realm of Dim Sum menu items and we leave her pretty much in charge of getting food on the table. There were a number of dishes that we didn't see or only saw when finishing our meal so their rotation for the dishes around the room wasn't the best. It was also nearly impossible for us to get water. We tried flagging down the relevant staff but no one was really bothering to eyeball the tables for service. Even when we managed to get a staff member and ask us for water, they said they would bring us a pitcher and needless to say they just walked away only to return to resetting the tables and never bring us water. Came out to $117 for 6 of us and we had some sticky rice and noodles to take home. Flavors were all great and everything was well cooked.  TIP: If you want more water, leave your tea top open. That's the \"its empty and needs to be refilled\" signage so it'll at least get a staff member to your table who you can then ask for water."}
{"text":"One of the few places that I used to eat dim sum at in Montreal was Kim Fung in Chinatown. I'm not sure if these two are related but I mistakenly thought in my mind that Kam Fung was Kim Fung. Oops. Well, if you find yourself crossing the bridge and heading to the south shore, this might be worth a try.  On Boxing day, we decided to brave the crowds and head out for dim sum. Lucky for us, one of my relatives got there early and managed to get the #1 spot. First one seated! All I can say is get there early because the lineup was pure insanity. The seating area is massive, think banquet style, yet it was completely full by 11:00am. When we were trying to exit, it was like leaving a zoo.   There were 15 of us so no way good pictures were going to happen. We ate the usual staples (ha gow, siu mai, cha siu bao, ha cheung, woo guk, tripe, bean curd, fried squid, rice with spare ribs, and jouk to name a few). The prices are in the $3.75 - $5.50 range if I recall correctly.   Decent dim sum but pretty standard in my books. I wouldn't drive all the way off the island if it was my choice."}
{"text":"This is one of the few dim sum places left in Brossard. I ate there before and I am always amazed at the service and the attention the waiters have for us.   Since I haven't had dim sum for ages, this one fit my appetite. When we came in at 1 pm, the place was packed with Chinese families. The ladies came over to our table with their trays and they let us know what they have. All the ladies were very kind and they joke with my father. It is one of the perks of speaking Cantonese because most of the service people were from the Canton areas or Hong Kong.   All the food are delicious. The place is well-kept and it is still a popular place to have decent Chinese food. The dim sum started at 10 or 11 am  and it ends at 3 pm."}
{"text":"I have ordered food for takeout here and I probably would've given 4 stars if I had written a review then.  The scallops in lobster sauce, in particular, was quite memorable. However, eating in the restaurant my experience was very far from that.   The restaurant was not too busy so we were seated immediately. (Note: this place is extremely popular on the weekend. We gave up on the lineup last time we tried eating here). We were immediately served water and jasmine tea and that's pretty much the only time we got service the whole time we were there.   We had to wait for 30 min before our order was taken. The waiter seemed pretty annoyed with our menu pyramid that we built to get his attention. Other patrons were regularly flagging the waiters through various other methods (raising their hand, calling the waiter, standing up etc.) We couldn't quite figure out the most efficient method to get their attention.   The food came pretty quickly after we ordered. Unfortunately, nothing was exciting. The beef in black bean sauce was extremely bland. We got duck in a different sauce (not sure which, sorry) that basically tasted the same. The peking duck was so underwhelming. And the young chow fried rice was disappointing. Last time I ordered this same fried rice and it was really good but this time it was just boring and tasteless.   The portions are very generous which would be an advantage if the food was palatable. We took it home to avoid waste but we're not too excited about the leftovers.   Getting our bill also took an unreasonable amount of time (and creative strategies to get a waiter's attention).   Overall, I was quite disappointed especially considering my previous experience which was positive. It wasn't disgusting but it didn't hit the spot for my Chinese food craving. The lack of service also tarnished the whole experience. Some of the waiters did seem friendly, though equally lacking in service."}
{"text":"One of the most popular dim sum restaurants in Brossard area of Montreal. Hug seating area but still gets extremely busy during weekends.   Dim sum prices ranges from 3-5 dollars per plate so it is reasonable but you can get better deals else where! I found the dim sum dishes hit or miss depending what you choose! You cannot go wrong with the classic selection of shrimp dumpling hai gou and pork dumpling siu mai. My favourite here is the beef tendon and sticky rice.   I advise you to come between 10-11 during weekends or you would have to wait for a while to get a seat!"}
{"text":"Food is decent compare to others however service is non-existent after the welcome rush."}
{"text":"if you are a white female, forget about decent service. have been going to this restaurant since before they moved to this location. one old grumpy waiter actually laughed at me using chopsticks, even though i have been eating Asian food with chopsticks for a very long time......having lived in Japan briefly and eaten in  Chinese restaurants all over the world, you should prepare to be insulted. brought 2 white friends with me who used to live in Hong Kong, they spoke to the waiter in Cantonese, were insulted. they truly think white people are a joke, except some of us Gweilo have eaten in more Chinese restaurants than most of the people there...... they have become too successful for their own good. arrogance prevails."}
{"text":"Food:6/10 The food is nothing comparable to Proper Asian dimsum, but in Mtl beggars can't be choosers. It is not consistant though. Some days, you might be hot, freshly cooked food, and other days, cold and stale. It's a complete crap shoot.  Variety-wise it's pretty decent. It's got chicken feet which is quite good.  Service: a solid 1/10. It's a complete mess. I have to stand up and walk to the tray to get food sometimes. Otherwise they pass by you at 100km/h Waiting time: maybe 30mins to 45 mins. Like I said, beggars can't be choosers. Such a lack of good dim sum places in Mtl.  Overall- 3.5/10 ign"}
{"text":"BEWARE! 3 Dead fish in the aquarium behind our table. Very unhygienic. Do not go here!"}
{"text":"This is where I do take out dimsum. It's not great but it's the best we've got around the area. Hey not everyone can be like GTA with their choices!"}
{"text":"Good dim sum, but pricey even with the favorable US $ to Canadian $ exchange rate."}
{"text":"We only had their dim sum which I felt was solid. We have better places in LA.  I thought the food and service was good. They were quite busy especially for a weekday before noon."}
{"text":"This must be the only dim sum restaurant left in Brossard since Jing Hua closed down- it looks wildly succesful, my family has been a couple times and there's always a line up out the door if you arrive around lunch time. It's a huge open space, decorated nicely, red carpeting, chandeliers and gold dragons on the back wall however, despite being fairly new, you can tell there's been high traffic. Dings and scratches on the walls, curtains and hanging liquor license and other plates are crooked and look unkempt.  Food is delicious, probably the best I've had outside of China - it actually really reminds me of being at a busy dim lunch right in Hong Kong, so many locals! Portions are generous and everything tastes fresh. Only issue is if you don't speak Chinese, staff can't help you too much. I had to ask 3 different people for a fork and getting a glass of water was equally challenging.  Carts came around quite often for being seated at the front, but after half an hour of trying to track down some type of radish patty dish I like, it was all gone by the time it came near me.  If you're a \"foreigner\" to dim sum, I strongly recommend checking out their website for pictures of the menu that way you know what to expect when the trolleys come around."}
{"text":"We tried this south-shore restaurant hoping it would be like the dim sum place in Montreal given the name.  The restaurant looks like a former banquet hall which means there's never a line and although it's not dim sum, you can't go wrong for the price.  Quick service in French or English and copious amounts of food.  Don't be fooled, the portions are all enormous and great for family-style meals where everyone shares (or takes home a doggie bag and eats for the rest of the week).  Order soup or dumplings and you definitely risk leftovers. The parking lot always seems full, but there is ample parking hidden in the back."}
{"text":"I really dislike this restaurant because there's always long wait and the dishes are overpriced. The flavouring of the dishes gets worse and worse from time to time that I go there: too salty, too oily... To avoid on weekends because lineups are crazy."}
{"text":"1er novembre 2012 Une belle occasion pour essayer ce restaurant. À première vue, tout est impeccable en entrant. Une grande salle de réception, évidemment,  puisque ce restaurant offre les Dim Sum, donc beaucoup d'espace pour s'installer et apprécier le repas. Les chariots passent mais moins souvent lorsqu'il est déjà 14h00, l'heure à laquelle je suis passé. Mais tout était très bon, un service courtois et attentionné. Le menu est très varié, cuisine vapeur, cuisine frite, plats à la carte, etc...  vous préférez emporter votre commande, aucun problème, ils offrent l'achat au comptoir.  J'y reviens assurément.  November 1st 2012 A great occasion to try this nice restaurant. At first glance, everything seems in place. The available room is impressive, but of course, they also serve Dim Sum. The waitresses navigate troughout the room with their small cart full of good stuff. It becomes less crowded when you are there around 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Everything was excellent, great service. A well composed menu, steamed food, fried food, \"à la carte\" meal, etc...  You prefer \"take out\", no problem. They offer it too.  I'm a new regular customer."}
{"text":"great varieties, fresh, not too greasy, i was able to eat almost everything gluten free, what a treat, the ambiance is amazing restaurant was full full full with huge line up, go Brossard! coming from plateau it is a real culture shock :)"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely packed at even 1pm, which is when we got to the restaurant. When we finished around 2pm, there was still a very long line to get in. I was kind of confused at the sight because the food honestly wasn't that great. The biggest issue was the food wasn't hot enough or their heat wasn't turned up high enough because it turned room temperature very quickly. Aside from that, the dim sum was pretty standard although I've been pretty spoiled by GTA dim sum I guess.   Also, they have way too few waiters for the number of tables in the restaurant and there were long waits for everything (bills, water, attention)."}
{"text":"Kam Fung is a very old school dimsum restaurant. there are no frills whatsoever. you get a # upon arrival if its packed, and they shout out your # when your table is ready. the system is very efficient. once your # is called, the hostess walks you to your table, asks you for the kind of tea you would like and puts the stamp card on the card holder on the table.  middle-aged ladies pushes carts along the aisles, sometime shouting out what they are offering but if you have dimsum often, you will know which cart has what by looking at the plates/steamers.   i typically get the same items in every dimsum restaurant, hargow (shrimp dumpling) suimai (pork and shrimp dumpling) chicken feet, steamed rice roll (with shrimp or with fried dough, or both), spare ribs and sometimes buns to be a filler if im still hungry.  for the most part, if you dont speak chinese, the ladies know enough english to let you know what the item is or what its made of. so have no fear if something look funny.   all in all, i like this place, although this time we mustve sat at a bad location, the carts with the common items didnt swing by much or often, but other than that, this place is legit."}
{"text":"Out of all 3 Kam Fung locations, this is by far my favourite because of the quality and freshness of the food, the attentiveness of the wait staff and the timely service.   This location is quite large, perfect to accommodate large groups, even weddings. They are busiest on Saturday nights around 7-8ish, so I would suggest Friday nights between 6-8.   Being creatures of habit, we normally order one crab claw for me (OMGGG SO DELICIOUS!!) and Danny orders spring rolls (he's allergic to seafood, so he doesn't get to partake in the yummy deep-fried crab claw indulgence). For our mains, we get chicken fried rice (with soy sauce, very very important), chicken chow mein, and beef and chinese broccoli. So, so, so good. Every dish we try is always super good; so far, we've had the pepper chicken and crispy spinach (one of my ultimate faves), crispy chicken, beef and chinese broccoli, chicken chow mein, chow fun with black bean sauce, lemon chicken, general tao, chicken fried rice, crab claws, spring rolls.. I'm sure there are more, but I'm just torturing myself at this point with the trip down memoery lane!   What makes the meal that much better though, is the tapioka soup that is served for dessert. Normally they will either bring you orange slices or banana with chocolate sauce and fortune cookies unless you ask for the tapioka soup. There are 2 variations, one hot and one cold, and sometimes they have a sweet lentil soup. All are yummmmm. Definitely worth the trip over the bridge for you \"island\"ers."}
{"text":"Ordered Beijing roast duck. Extremely dissatisfied. It's dry and hard to bite. Other dishes are very oily."}
{"text":"Wow quelle belle découvertes. Si vous desirez gouter la cuisine chinoise traditionnelle et non le genre americain c est l endroit par excellence. Les portions sont généreuses et tout est sublimement delicieux."}
{"text":"Sunday dim sum! I live downtown Montreal. When comes the time for dim sum, i would cross the bridge and come here to satisfy my craving. It's just because there is no good dim sum restaurant on the island anymore!  I usually come here at the opening (10am) because it gets busy really fast. Unlike today, we decided to come here at 11 am with our friends to have dim sum. It was full! We waited for about 20 minutes before getting our table. That's to be expected.   The carts kept on coming and we kept on ordering. Mainly our classics but some unfamiliar items as well. For those who like the chicken feet, this place does it quite well. The har gow (shrimp dumpling) and the siu mai (pork dumpling) are especially good here. What about the baby squid and steamed pork chop pieces on rice? Devine!!! The fried items are a bit on the greasy side but oh so flavourful! Don't be afraid to ask for extra hot sauce, hot mustard and soy sauce for they don't always have it automatically on the table. Service is really nice and fast. Even if their english or french is broken, the staff make a really good effort which is always appreciated!"}
{"text":"One of my Montreal friends recommended me to this place. It was kind of hard to find because it's located inside a mall. The restaurant had a line, but it didn't take long for me and my friends to be seated.   I ordered a bunch of dim sum and it was great. All the food I picked was fresh from the pork buns to the egg tarts. I would recommend this place to anyone out of town that wants dim sum!"}
