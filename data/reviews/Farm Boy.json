{"text":"I've loved Farm Boy since my very first visit a few years ago, (another location, of course). Last year, I purchased their pre-made Christmas dinner which was fantastic and easy to prepare... It was beyond my high expectations. Not only are their products unique, they're superior to many. And in addition to their outstanding products and their insanely hospitable and helpful service, they pay attention to every little detail. They cater to some \"little things\" that other chains wouldn't even think of. Little things, like how they'll core your pineapple at no charge. I couldn't be happier that one is about to open a few blocks from my home!

Highlights - what's in store at Farm Boy Etobicoke:

Abundant, high quality fresh produce; with organic and local in season.
Hundreds of Ontario-made products including organic, natural and gluten free items.
A 52-foot wholesome and healthy fresh salad and hot bar, with fresh sushi and pizza made to order.
Deeply marbled premium Canada AAA beef, aged a minimum of 14 days.
Over 400 local farmsteads, artisan, international and Canadian award-winning cheeses.
Fieldgate, hormone free, fresh organic beef, pork and chicken and eco-friendly, sustainable fresh seafood.
Fresh Oven Roasts cut to order with premium meats, slowly roasted without preservatives.
Over 400 fresh Ontario dairy products including Ontario organic milk delivered fresh.
Over 15 varieties of fresh soups, all made from scratch and served hot or available cold."}
{"text":"Yessssssssss!!! Farm boy opened today in Etobicoke (March 1st) and the day was a huge success! Tons of crowds, beautiful store, excellent products! I am so happy that this store is in our neighbourhood! This plaza was so depressing for way too long. Now, the parking lot is full and bustling. So pumped to have sushi and stone oven pizza within walking distance! Lol."}
{"text":"Got up bright and early to go to opening day to get my FREE $20 gift card cause #YOLO. Kidding it's because I don't start my new job for another few weeks and I needed a reason to get out of bed before 11am. I'm always on the quest for the perfect grocery store and this ticked all my boxes...although I still can't find a place that has chicken apple sausages outside of America but apparently Canadians haven't discovered those magical flavours yet. Since no one carries them, no demerit points...but if any of you grocery stores wanted to sell them and are reading this, I'd love you forever...or at least the next 50 years!!!

Back on topic. Farm Boy is bright, well stocked and nicely laid out (the swinging monkey is perhaps a bit tacky but I'm guessing some person high up insisted on it and you do you design guy). I liked the variety and prices too. Lots of chicken and turkey sausages...but just to confirm, no chicken apple sausages...yet. Good gluten free items as well. There is fresh, affordable produce (from near and far and organic and non). 

I normally don't get pre-made food cause it's pricey but when you have a whole $20 to spend, why not. I got their stuffed mushrooms and hot damn they were good. 2 for $5 and stuffed with rice, sausage, cheese and potentially love. Threw them in the oven at home and they were delicious. I Highly recommend them.

There's also ready to eat food a la Whole Foods style. I think it's about $2.19/100 grams - not sure how that compares to whole lotta dollars foods but I'm assuming it's cheaper. Is anything more expensive than Whole Foods? Like aside from a Tesla? Farm Boy does breakfast and lunch at the pay by weight buffet/salad bar. Breakfast looked great with eggs, potatoes, sausages, bacon, wraps, beans etc. Then there are pizza, sushi and stir fry stations. You can have your cake (and well whatever you want) and eat it too...cause what else would you do with cake? Sayings...am I right? 

They apparently have lots of cheese so if you are not a monster and like cheese - here's your place! 

In conclusion I'm a fan. It's not the most convenient so hop in an uber or car pool and get on over! Be sure to ask them about chicken apple sausages - let's start the revolution people!!! These are the important issues of our time..jokes it's definitely all about gun control in America but I digress."}
{"text":"This is definitely a nice supermarket. But one that only sells food. Don't come here looking for toilet paper, toothpaste or anything other than food because you're not going to find it. 

What you will find is lots of produce, prepared foods and take out stuff that I would say matches what you would get at a Whole Foods. The prices however are about similar to what you'd get at your local Metro or Loblaws. 

I've only been once, shortly after they opened but when I find myself in the area I will definitely go again. There's more to see and hopefully it will be worth the trip."}
{"text":"A grocery store that was desperately needed in the Long Branch/South Etobicoke area! 
They have a great produce section, awesome Farm Boy brand/made dressings, and lots of interesting finds! I love the Fauxmagerie Zengarry vegan spreads they carry, and I also love that each time I visit, they seem to have more vegan items. The hot table/counter area has a lot of options and things are conveniently labelled very well! The staff are super nice and really helpful, which makes it easy to love coming to Farm Boy to do my regular shopping!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a smaller yet cheaper version of Whole Foods.  I would not call it the Canadian version of Trader Joe's though.  The branded and packaged groceries (i.e. pasta, cereal, oatmeal, etc.) are about the same price as Real Canadian Superstore, but where Farm Boy wins out is that they have their own branded items that appear to be all organic.  

In addition, their hot food section is really good for a grocery store.  They have a wood fire pizza oven, a stir fry station, salad bar and a hot bar.  

I've had the pizza from their Kitchener location and it is really good.  From this location, I chose from the hot bar and there were plenty of vegan options.  I remember getting multiple types of curry, a General Tao chicken variation and some rice. It was very tasty.  It's also cheaper than Whole Foods at $2.19/100g.  

The only thing that is missing is that there aren't many unprepared vegan options you can buy here (they have plenty of fresh meat, none frozen) as they don't have freezers.  

Verdict: Great for hot food and packaged foods and probably fresh meat (I can't tell, but there was a huge lineup when I went, so I assume it is pretty good)."}
{"text":"When I heard about Farm Boy and that it was opening up in Toronto, I knew I had to check this place out. You see I'm a huge fan of Trader Joes. And while I have reluctantly accepted that we may never get a Trader Joes here in Canada, I was excited to hear that there is a reasonable alternative already available in Canada. 

I think the best way to describe Farm Boy is that it is like a Whole Foods crossed with Trader Joes. You get the freshly prepared foods and hot and cold food bars as at Whole Foods, but also many of the reasonably priced organic and healthier produce and packaged items similar to what one can find at a Trader Joes. Looking for zucchini spirals? Premium almond milk? Amazing lemon garlic vinaigrette? Organic or wheat alternative flours? Pecan butter tarts? Organic produce? Farm Boy has all that!

Conveniently located close to the highway, Farm Boy has a an impressive selection of organic, local, and vegan options. If I lived closer to this store, I'd probably avail myself of the fresh made food, hot table food options, salads, deli, pizza making and stir fry to order options. I was overwhelmed by the plentiful selection of cheeses in their cheese and deli section. I bought the small batch hazelnut gelato because it looked interesting and like something Whole Foods would sell for at least 1.5 times the price. 

I walked away with 2 bagfuls of groceries for $36. Not a bargain but not the whole pay check that I've come to occasionally spend at Whole Foods. I look forward to returning with the hubby to sample more of the freshly prepared food."}
{"text":"Farm boy had it goodn'. I came here cuz ma told me there's sum up yonder north of here, and it so happen that it was its first Saturday open. Hoooo weeee, was it PACKED with people from all round! 
 As for prices it was reasonable as I heard that all of its products are grown in Ontario with PLENTY of organic food stuffs and all sorts of hearty meats red, dark, seasoned etc. but it mind boggling how many people there was... lots of options for take out food. To name a few things that you can take out: paninis (grilled on the spot), many healthy salads, pastas, pizzas, soups, and much more! 
 I definitely will come back to shop more in depth especially after having a sample of this \"Nupasta\" that's pasta made from a plants root called Kognac, it sounds like the liquor, con-yeea-aak... something of that nature. 
 For you hardcore carnivores there flinstone steaks with bones so big that you can use it as a handle! I could go on but there's too much to say!"}
{"text":"Great store, will definitely visit again.  Very nice and clean inside.  The only negative for us would be the location is too small.  Was there around 12pm on Saturday, and it was fairly busy.  Gets hard to navigate around the check-out area when the line starts to back up, which is right by cheese, bakery section, but we managed with 3 kids and 2 carts.  

For the most part,it seems the prices were pretty fair and on par with other stores.  We notice some items in the dairy section was priced higher, but not too surprised since it is dairy products.  It was also neat to see some items you don't normally see in other places.  

We just had lunch so did not try any of the fresh foods, but they looked good. They had a variety of flavours to choose from for the ready-to-go chickens.  There were also sushi, pizza, salads, soups, and sandwiches.   

I would compare Farm Boy to a Whole Foods more than any other store, minus the ridiculous prices on everything.  Plus I think they are actually a Specialty Store?  But that being said, you might not find some basic items that you would see anywhere else. For example, we were looking for a big iced t or something for the kids. But the drinks section was very limited. Not much of the regular drinks you see anywhere else."}
{"text":"Boy you should have seen the Asian grocery store that was in here before....  A mess of a store (failed).  Farm Boy took it's time and built a beautiful store in Etobicoke.  Really great to have this variety and option in the area.  Clean, lots of parking.  There was never a reason to visit this mall before Farm Boy (boring Dollar store, not much else..).
I will mention; a relatively medium sized salad was over 10 bucks.  Plus a medium sized butter chicken/mac n cheese also expensive.  The salads are decent, also costly.  For these prices a restaurant would be more alluring."}
{"text":"3.5 stars ... if you treat this more as a true grocery store and not the Trader Joe's the media have been pushing, it's a great spot.

The media truly hyped this spot with it's phrase of \"Canadian Trader Joe's\".  For all those who know about Trader Joe's, you know thats the awesome spot in the USA to find super affordable and great house brand snacks, cheeses, drinks, alcohol (2 buck chuck anyone? ugh), and did I mention snacks?? 

With that in mind, I came to Farm Boy and realized it's not a Trader's Joe.  Rather it's a step up from a regular grocery store but certainly not in the same pantheon as Trader Joe's.  The size is similar to a Longo's. So you can do all your shopping here if you wanted and it has enough variety. 
 With a focus on local and organic, I can appreciate the enthusiasm from other reviews.  If I were very focused on only sourcing organic, this would be a great spot as the organic is not a 2 ft by 2 ft spot in a corner somewhere.  There is a lot of fruit and vegetable offerings in addition to a decent butcher area.  Looking at the prices, it sits somewhere in the Loblaws price range for normal organic ... I do have to admit one thing, the items here look better than some of the wilted items at Loblaws.

One thing that Farm Boy takes on that other places don't do very well... the ready made items.  Nearly a quarter of the floor space is dedicated to their pre-made salads, sandwiches, sushi, deli, pasta, soup, and pizza area.  Looking at the condition of everything, nothing looks gross but some things were looking at little aged.  I guess you can't expect too much when it's 2 hour before close. Judging the weight of some items, your take out meal can easily hit over $15.  For just take out, it does give me pause but if it's made with only organic items... maybe it's worth it.  Though I never saw signage that spelled that out.  

As for the organization of the store... full kudos.  It's clean, it's bright, it's well spaced, and at 7 pm in the evening, there's enough parking that it feels like a regular suburbia store.  

Lastly... the snacks.  This is what brought me here to Farm Boy originally.  It's safe to say the small area is definitely a smaller footprint than a Trader Joe's.  Sure they had some interesting few items like the Farm Boy maple chocolate covered nuts but it was really a few shelves.  Definitely not the eye catching and hunger inducing offering of the Trader Joe's.

So if you're looking for a locally focused grocery store, this would be a good spot to check out.  Seeing how the parking lot is small and the other reviews say it's mayhem during the day, perhaps check out during the evening.  Just leave your media commentary off to the side and you'll like this spot."}
{"text":"Its an ABSOLUTELY beautiful store.

Very helpful staff and management.

Lots of fresh produce, meat, store brands, etc.

I had a loaded pizza with artichokes, goat cheese, onions, pineapple, olives etc.  It was AWESOME! 

They have a huge salad bar, plus custom panini, etc etc.  Which I can't wait to try. 

Their farm boy brand clam chowder was terrible though.  No flavour, at all.  No herbs, no salt, nothing. For $6.99 for 2 small bowls, I won't be buying it again. 

Great store!  Great location.  Hopefully they do well!"}
{"text":"I've never really found a compelling grocery store offering in Canada- either they are expensive with good quality or cheap with passable quality- Farm Boy manages to have high quality, excellent value, and really unique hyperlocal products.  I stumbled across some ketchup made in North York, Fair Trade dark chocolate milk, some excellent sushi, super good produce of all kinds and lamb shanks, which up until now I had to get at a specialty  butcher.  And their flyer specials were AMAZING!  It could easily match a local No Frills or Food Basics.  I will DEFINITELY be back again.  (Of course there are some more expensive items- but well worth it.)"}
{"text":"I really like this grocery store, I just wish it wasn't so far. They have a great selection of organic food and farm boy branded products which are priced reasonable. What I love most about farm boy is that their labels have an indication of whether they are vegetarian or vegan. This has cut down on my shopping time. It's so easy to pick out vegan products.
The aisles are kept clean and the shelves are always fully stocked. Hopefully they will open up a location in York region."}
{"text":"Really great products! I definitely would compare it to Trader Joes but it has a Longos type layout. I didn't get to spend enough time in the store but all of the items I brought home were super fresh! Looking forward to going back again!"}
