{"text":"We stopped here on our way home from our little trip to Kalahari.  My kids love this place so we figured what the heck.
     This was just your typical CiCi's with the same ole' pizza choices, pasta and small salad bar.  My kids think the pizza is the best but I think that they know when they are done, we will let them play for awhile in the arcade.  
     The service was average but they did keep the pizza's fresh and stocked on the buffet table.  They do have a new desert pizza which was dough topped with custard, sweet white icing and chocolate drizzle.  Was actually pretty tasty.
     This was a great way to end our trip as it made the kids happy and we enjoy watching them be happy."}
{"text":"they really need to deep clean this place, everything looks so sticky  and dirty mainly the floor!!! they never have reg pizza out it and when they do it looks like its been there for a while, the lettuce was wilted"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza and wings here for the first time today.  I've heard alot of great things about the food so I had to judge it for myself.  I was definitely not disappointed,  the pizza was awesome and the wings were even better! Anyone reading this should definitely take my word for it as you to will not be disappointed.  Great friendly staff and even better food!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. I wouldn't feed this to my dogs. If your a fat ass who likes to gorge themselves to the point of bursting then knock yourself out. But this place has inferior carcinogenic delights."}
{"text":"Food looked like it been cut a couple days ago, pizza was hard, and the brownies were undercooked. horrible experience"}
{"text":"Used to be good but hey, THEY ARE CLOSED!  Why can't Cici's keep its restaurants open?"}
{"text":"this place is great honestly staff is great the chicken noddle soup is deliciouse the cinnomon bread and fudge is awesome u can stay here as longAS U CAN KEEP REQUESTING EVERYTHING U WANT WITH NO EXTRA CHARGE AT ALL ITS AWESOME"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here but they do put in the effort into making a decent pizza. The prices are legitimate and the delivery time was very quick.I ordered 3 medium pizzas with 3 toppings on each with 3 dipping sauces for $27 including tax and free delivery. Pizza was hot and tasty with fresh toppings. I've  also passed by the place and seen that their walk in deals are enough to make a miser smile at how affordable they are. Only drawback for me is they don't offer debit on delivery which for me is a real sore point. Overall though they do merit repeat business."}
{"text":"I recently viewed the Cici's commercial on TV advertising their $3.99 all-u-can eat pizza special. $3.99 for all the soup, salad, pizza, and dessert I wanted? I had to check it out. I purposely skipped breakfast, and showed up on a Sunday around 1pm. After waiting about 15 minutes in line to pay, I paid about $6.25 for the buffet with a to-go cup for soda. The family of 7 in front of me paid less than $20 for all of 'em. What a deal! 

First stop, the big premade salad bowls. The ranch salad consisted of lettuce, bacon bits, and ranch dressing, and the latter was lettuce, red onions, black olives, and grape tomatoes with Italian dressing. Lot's of lettuce and dressing, with a little bit of the rest. 

Next was the chicken noodle soup, which I passed on. Next to it was a big troth of pasta sauce, with a couple corkscrew pasta noodles in it. I took a bowl of the bland, flavorless sauce with some bread sticks. On to the pizza! 

I took the baby plate, and started to load up on the minuscule slices of pizza. Macaroni and cheese pizza, BBQ chicken pizza, buffalo chicken pizza, pepperoni, there was a good selection to choose from. After swerving my way through about 200 kids and screaming parents, I finally got a soda and attempted to locate a table. I guess everyone in Phoenix saw the same commercial, because they were all there. I found a table near the exit and started to sample the goods. The macaroni and cheese pizza was disgusting. The corkscrew pasta I left for someone else was on top of a cold crust with some old cold cheese sauce. Next the BBQ pork pizza. Surprisingly, this was the best of the bunch. The sauce was sweet and tangy, and there was actually a good amount of cheese. The bread sticks were also great, along with the alfredo pizza. The buffalo chicken pizza was also nothing to write home about...a piece of bread with buffalo wing sauce on top, and tiny chicken cubes. Yuck. 

All of a sudden I heard some singing...something about \"yippee yipee Mexican pizza\" or something like that. I excitedly ran up surrounded by a bunch of rug rats to grab a a piece with some other cardboard samples. Returning to my table less than a minute later, everything was gone. My pizza, my plates, my to-go cup I paid extra for, even my Sunday paper. I looked behind me to see a girl with the dirty dish bin on wheels patrolling around, clearing off tables in the madness of people. She looked at me like a deer in headlights, and ran. I laughed, got another cup for my soda, and continued to grub. 

The Mexican pizza....bread with sauce, lettuce and 2 shreds (yes, cold not even melted small individual straight from the bag) of cheddar cheese. Great, I now have the recipe on how to make Mexican food at home. Want some Mexican ice cream or Mexican egss? Just throw just shredded lettuce on top and voila! The only thing Mexican about the pizza was the name of it and the nationality of the lady who put it on the hot plate. The rest of the other pizza was the same, little cheese, sparse toppings, little sauce, cold...off to dessert.

I stood up and saw the bus lady lurking, she was everywhere I turned. I told her \"I'm not done yet, I'm still eating\" and went back to the buffet line. I decided to try the dessert, so I got a plate of cinnamon buns and brownies. I headed back to my table just as the bus woman started to clear my table. As soon as she noticed me, her eyes got big again and poof! She was gone . The dessert was an excellent surprise! The buns had delicious icing, were gooey, and warm. The brownies were also warm, chocolaty, and melt in your mouth. 

All in all, Cici's was like a bad acid trip.  Every time the door opened, either by a person or the wind, the crew \"enthusiastically\" screamed \"Welcome to Cici's!\" or \"Thanks for coming in! See you next time!\". By the hundredth time hearing that over the first 10 minutes, and listening to the screaming kids and parents who could care less if their kids were rude, loud, and obnoxious, I was ready to claw my ears off. On a good note, the staff aimed to please. I saw an elderly couple come in, go to the counter, and ask for a spinach pizza. 10 minutes later, they had a whole spinach pizza delivered to their table, all for themselves, at no extra charge. For that, the dessert, the barbecue pizza, and the bread sticks, I give Cici's 2 stars. Also, where else can you feed a family of seven an all-you-can eat meal with free balloons as toys for less than $20??? 

Will I go to Cici's again? If I lose my job and life savings, become homeless, don't eat for a week, and find $5. on the side of the road, I would possibly consider spending my day at Cici's. Or if I have a burning desire to eat all the BBQ pizza, cinnamon buns, and brownies in an attempt to gain a ton of weight. However, I don't for\"Cici\" that happening anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"When i am having a bad day and I want some pizza (buffet) for cheap and dont feel like cooking... ($5/person) and they have military discount Cici's Pizza is the place i want to go most!! 

I love their taco,buffalo chicken,macaroni and cheese (i know sounds gross but man I promise it is phenomenal!!)

They also have salas,soups, pasts and dessert pizzas!!! 

I think the best thing is that you can tell them what pizza you want (or are craving) and they will make it for you and bring it to your table!! Any creation you can think of they will make!! :D 

The staff is great they are always peppy and make you feel welcomed!!"}
{"text":"When your stretching the dollar, Cici's fits the budget. It's an all you can eat buffet. If you've never been, you will find some odd pizza combinations like macaronin and cheese or taco (which is decent).  The pizza taste isn't particularly traditional, even the regular ones like sausage or pepperoni.  I can't quite place it on the cheese either, not quite mozarella, slightly different.  They have 2 salad types in the buffet and a couple of desserts (one is always a baked cinnamon roll)  Very much family oriented. The stellar staff and low prices make up for the middle of the road tasting food."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza ever, but it's dependable as a \"I don't feel like cooking\" alternative.
Also LOVE the wings!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! They have a new manager who is polite, fun and very accommodating. Glad I got to meet him."}
{"text":"We just left the place and I feel like I need to shower. Holy obesity! 80% of people in there were morbidly obese which made the smell unbearable. The remaining 20% looked like they fell straight out of the trailer park. I was afraid to eat the food definitely steered clear if the soggy looking salad and nasty pasta. The pizza was ok cinnamon rolls yummy but sooo not worth inhaling the body fat odor and holding down your food from the distasteful scenery."}
{"text":"Short and sweet: Staff is very engaging and polite. Hannah(works cash register) and the new owner are extremely professional and nice. The ladies that were in charge of cleaning up the tables after guests leave were friendly, but very chatty with each other. Our plates sat on our table the whole time we were there. We had to move them to a clean table, which we felt bad about but what were we supposed to do? Dining room wasn't very clean.
Food: Ok I suppose. It is almost never hot. Lukewarm at best. The ingredients are awful and cheap. You can pick out cheap pizza fairly easily by look and taste. They all had the same crust, and even as they ran out, they never brought out new pizza. The deserts were really good, however. Very hot and sweet. Can't complain there. All in all, if you have a big family to feed, or just want to load up on food, it's good. If you can afford to be picky, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"If I was craving pizza and this was the only restaurant that was open, I would probably order something else. Their wings are quite good, the garlic bread and potato wedges are fine (actually they taste like the type you might get at the hot counter of a grocery store), but the pizza isn't my style. For a cheap meal combo, though, and some decent wings, I'd go back."}
{"text":"I walk by here all the time and finally decided to give it a shot the other day. What a pleasant surprise. Great value for your money! Perfect ratio of dough, cheese and sauce which I find that many other places can't get right. Definite repeat"}
{"text":"This is a great place for kids under 12.....for adults it is simply terrible"}
{"text":"EXTREMELY upset that they changed the cinnamon rolls. They are now thin, flat pieces of bread that taste like pizza dough with cinnamon and icing on top. GROSS!"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, get what you pay for. Buffet so I guess they shoot for quantity and not quality. Also the dinning room needs improvement. The one wall looked pretty beat up, looks like someone got happy with a knife. Will go back as it was cheap and when we are in Vegas we are on a budget."}
{"text":"Do not go their they may put in jail for using your own credit card.
Talked to the owner Mike on the phone and he said I was doing credit card fraud
By using my own bank account 





I will never go their again
Customers beware DO NOT GO THEIR"}
{"text":"I discovered Cici's when I moved in to my boyfriend's bachelor apartment in the heart of Parkdale six years ago. It was only for a month before we moved out to a larger apartment in a different neighbourhood but during that time we managed to cram as much Cici's pizza into our bodies as possible.

It is not a fancy place. At any given time in the summer there are flies indoors. There are only a few spots to sit, and you probably wouldn't want to sit there anyway. But if you can look past these things, you're in for a real treat.

Cici's has the perfect combination for a classic pizza: not-too-thick soft crust, simple tomato sauce, plenty of cheese, and enough pepperoni that it doesn't overpower the rest of the flavours. Altogether this makes for a mean pie.

Less than $9 +tax for an extra large pizza is a steal. This is one of the few things I miss about living in Parkdale!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.  Good place to take young children just because it's so noisy there.  Note to self though, do not go on a Saturday afternoon at lunch time.  I really didn't want to go today at that time, but we were in the area....much better to go on a Friday afternoon when everyone is at school and work (yay to 4-10 work weeks!)  A bit too crowded for my liking but the pizza isn't horrible and there is a lot of selection.  You just have to deal with the typical family of 20 and greedy folks that pile 50 slices of pizza on their plate like they aren't going to make anymore."}
{"text":"Quite good pizza-style pizza.  Remember the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon from the 1990s? And remember how delicious the pizza always looked in that cartoon?  This is that type of pizza.  It's just... pizza.  Nothing remarkable about it, but when you're craving this type of pizza nothing else will do.

The hot wings are really good and the pizza/wing/garlic bread/wedgies combos are a good deal. 

If you're looking for a solid greasy pizza and wings place, look no further than CiCi's."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice within 3 days and not because I wanted to.  I'm not a fan of buffets for my lack of self control.  LOL  Monday I brought my daughter and her friend for lunch.  Immediately you are greeted by all the employees \"Welcome to Cici's!\".  Pretty nice little greeting I must say. The girl at the cashier asked \"how many\" and I said 3.  As I started to ask about the child rate she handed me a receipt that said 3 adults.  I simply asked her what was the age for the child rate.  She in turn asked me how old the girls were.  I replied that both of them are 11 and in passing asked \"oh is the age 10 and under\" and she replied back \"no its 11 and under\".  She proceeded to look past me to help the next customer and I shook my head and decided to just dismiss that whole convo.  Challenging stupidity doesn't make for a good lunch with my girls.

We quickly found our seats and the girls were up and at em.  We each grabbed a tray.  A couple of the dishes I picked up were dirty so I just set them to the side. The pasta is one of my favorite simple things however when I got up there the pasta needed refilled.  I asked the girl behind the counter if they knew their pasta needed refilled.  She replied \"yes\" and continued with her pizzas not even headed to the pasta to see what I was referring to.  Instead she addressed some \"regular\" customers behind me-hence the immediate dismissal of the question.  Kinda awkward to say the least. Finally 10 minutes later it was refilled. Sigh.

They serve pasta salad, salad, soup, corkscrew pasta with red and white sauce, breadsticks & garlic knots, a plethora of pizza and a few dessert options.  Their  food is what it is....a really cheap family buffet.  With that said the pizzas leave a lot to be desired, don't have much cheese or meat, have a lot of dough but is all good for the carb-evore in you!  This place really should be named CiCi's CARB Buffet! Its a bread lovers dream! You seriously need to put in some cardio time after eating here.

The place is pretty beat up.  The walls, floors and tables are scuffed up and chipped.  Its definitely a place to bring all the children and your neighbors children.  You can tell they all have been here! LOL  There are TVs mounted up high that had children shows on them.  You cant hear the sound so I'm always not sure why restaurants even bother.  There is a small arcade in the back that the kids love.  There's a community board that has a few things posted but looks all greasy from little hands touching it.  Another dirty detail.

Now while the girls were spending their couple dollars on the arcade I was checking in on my handy dandy YELP app on my phone.  While I sit there and observe the chaos around me, my eyes found there way up the wall in slow motion....  Eeek! The Health Department grade!  Like an elephant in the room-how did I miss it when it was right in front of me the whole time I was eating!  I can say I'm not surprised however at the same time I'm not even sure if I had ever seen a C Grade in person.  Hm. That's right Graded a C!  Thank goodness it was after we ate because that is a sure turn off to me regardless of the details.  I do watch Restaurant Impossible! LOL

On a side note, at the end of our meal the manager came over to ask if everything was to our satisfaction.  I decided not to bother to inform him of the awkward and lazy service from his employees.  I think the place is run with super young people with lack of guidance possibly.  He was just a baby himself-or I'm just old.  I beg to differ.  LOL  

Needless to say, I will not be back anytime soon.  This is only a \"when I have to\" place to eat - category of Chuck E Cheese. LOL.  I will for sure be checking the grade next time though with curiosity of an upgrade! ;)"}
{"text":"Cici's is my go to place for a pizza buffet. Why? It's cheap, tasty enough and the cinnamon rolls are awesome.

The salad selection's lame, but what the heck I only add that onto the plate to kid myself I'm eating healthy...

Value for money?: I'd value this lunch at $6.49, but since it's usually cheaper then I always feel like I get a good deal. For me that pushes it from a solid 3-star place into a 4-star place."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in i was enthusiastically greeted by the staff paid for the buffet only 4.99 a great value.  The salad was ok lettuce was a little limp, and there was all different varieties of mediocre tasting pizza nothing to great about it except the price.  In the back there was a little arcade played air hockey  a dollar a play.   I would go back just for the prices but I am sure there is better tasting pizza out there."}
{"text":"I just want to thank Terrance his evening crew at CiCis on Decatur who helped us on Thursday 8/27/15. 
I made a reservation for 20 plus people so my Cub Scout Den could meet and start the new Scouting year off. The staff was very polite, courteous and helpful... They even had reserved signs on our tables.. The pizza was always fresh and hot. They kept the tables clean and always asked if we needed anything..  Thank you for a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Oh man did I take a wrong turn. I had to grab lunch with a co-worker and we had limited time, so we stopped into this place. They had a 5.99 all you can eat pizza buffet, which included salad and desserts. I can understand why families with children would want to come here...but I would definitely not come back that's for sure. If you're looking for pizza even something halfway decent this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Having lived in Texas for many years I used to love a cheap pizza buffet so I was excited to try one again...the only reason it gets 3 stars is for the BBQ pizza they have. I had them make me a fresh one. I love love love it. Always have. 

The downfalls were waiting at the counter and having to go find someone to pay, the crap lettuce for the salad bar, dirty silverware, dry dry dry pizza that was sitting there, and the worst part was the god awful loud ass music they were playing. The only other table in there kept saying how terrible it was as well. I asked the girl at the counter if corporate made them play that. She just smiled. Ugh. It was baaaad. 

I think I'll skip this place for now and remember better times in Texas."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! I'm definitely what you would call a pizza snob. My go to is double pepperoni and double cheese. I also love the wings. I definitely recommend this place if you're in a pizza mood."}
{"text":"It's been about a year since the last time I ate at Cici's and, even though the deal is good and kids would like it, the quality of pizza has gone down.
What bothers me is that some of the music that gets played in this restaurant (as well as other locations that I've been to) is completely inappropriate for young children. As we were sitting at the table, I actually heard \"Funky Cold Medina\" playing. If you don't know this song, look up the lyrics and tell me if they're appropriate. When mentioned to the woman in charge, we were informed that it's the 80s channel and the parents seem to like it. I'm sorry... The children are the impressionable ones.
If I had kids, I wouldn't bring them here."}
{"text":"This location is very clean, and the staff is very attentive. The manager announces the pizzas as he puts them on the line so you know if it is something that interests you without getting up and wading through kids to see what's up there."}
{"text":"So there's this conspiracy in the SF Bay to advertise us food that we can't get there. This only mildly upset me when they start playing commercials for Sonic in the middle of the night (the nearest one being 47 miles away). I became enraged that I was being taunted by commercials for Buffalo Wild Wings (which I dearly love) because the closest one is 402 miles south. 

But Cici's. You were the icing on that cake of \"shit you can look at on TV but not touch.\" As far as I can tell you don't even EXIST in California. Why are you advertising here every 30 minutes on every channel? Is this some sort of joke? Why are you taunting my poor starved little college wallet with the promise of a real meal for under $5? Do you know how much it costs to eat in Silicon Valley??!  You can't even get a side salad that cheap most places!

Oh Cici's, I lusted after your promise of an end to my Jack in the Box catered everything. 

Luckily I spend most of my free time in Phoenix, which actually has Sonics and BWW's and Dave and Busters. And now, Cici's! I couldn't wait to get in and try everything! This is indeed a mortal paradise, a proverbial garden of cheap pizza delights.

I could never have foreseen the horrors. 

Eating at Cici's is like marrying the man of your dreams and finding out his entire extending family is moving in with him. All of them, every niece and nephew, sister and brother, cousin and half cousin, grannie, grampy, great grannie, all of them. All of them AND their children. The noise...THE NOISEEEEE.

I have never felt  so claustrophobic  in such a large space. There was no where to turn, no where to hide. It was like a food fight in a bad 80's teen movie. Screaming and laughing and crying to the sound of food hitting the floor and full glasses being knocked over. Grubby hands smearing pizza sauce everywhere. And Cici's employees floating around asking everyone how their experience is, smiling like they've got guns pointed at their backs, working that good old fashioned doublethink, \"this is fine, everything is fine, keep smiling, KEEP SMILING, everything is under control, oh my god, KEEP SMILING.\" 

To be fair to Cici's, it's not their fault. You open a cheap chain and you're going to attract the families in search of deals. Families with lots of hungry children. Hungry children are ill-behaved. Especially when there's 100 of them.

The food is exactly what you expect for a $5 pizza buffet. It's fine, it's totally passable, if you spend $5 to eat there you will leave feeling totally ok about that. It's not a deal, but it's not a rip-off. 

No, the rip-off is what happens when junior #23, #32, and #47 all conspire to tear your cargo pockets off your shorts while you're trying to fill your soda. Or when they decide to trip you onto the floor by the Mac and Cheese pizza and strip your carcass to the bones. 

Keep back, you filthy little hooligans! This place is madness!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! The manager has poor customer service skills,  never ever again! Don't bother asking for a higher person he said he didn't have a number for them"}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza deal in town. And fantastic pizza and wings to boot!

Unlike other discount pizza places, the pizza at Cici's is always fresh and cooked perfectly. They have a realy unique way of making their crust. They use a spiked rolling pin which puts hundreds of little holes in the dough which lends to a nice airy and crispy crust. The pepperoni is always crispy and has a great flavour. 

I order this deal:
1 large pizza with three toppings
24 wings (the hot ones are really unique)
Potato wedges (or fries)
4 cans of pop
Dipping sauce

For 24.00!!! Including tax and delivery!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, both time with coupons. Joined the email club for one, and one came in the mail. This location is fairly new and very clean.
The counter staff is super friendly, greeting you when you walk in and leave. The pizza variety is awesome, esp cheeseburger and this deep dish ranch sauce pepperoni :d there is also a streusel Pizza akin to cake and pudding that is just divine.
They have a jukebox, a tv that always has on icarly, and a small arcade for kids.
Will definitely be back for more because I love variety!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza at a great price!  Best I've had in Toronto!  The ingredients are made fresh and you can really taste the difference.  my favorite is a large pizza with pepperoni, green peppers, onions, bacon for $11!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I completely agree that Cici's has good pizza for an incredible low pirce! That's a good thing when you want to eat with friends but you're  on a budget. The thing that bothered me when going to this Cici's was the un-professional staff! We came for dinner with our friends {that hadn't been before} and a worker handed my friend a rag to clean our table while three employees talked and laughed like whatever. As we started eating our plates piled up with nobody to come by and clear them..we watched as the manager slowly cleaned around the soda machine and around the food area. It just seemed by watching the staff that the employees really didn't want to  be there and looked bored and didn't want to work. Regardless of price I feel that a place should always always be professional didn't expierence that! Two stars just to be nice."}
{"text":"From the time you walk in the door it becomes amazing!!! A friend of mine asked me if I would like to go to a $5.99 pizza buffet, I thought yeah, right would be a fast food dumpy place. When walked in the door we were immediately welcomed very genuinely. My friend immediately commented about the cleanliness of the dining area. For $5.99 the buffet was very good, the deserts outstanding and everything very fresh. The manager Trevor is amazing with both customers and the staff. The floor server Arlene was beyond fantastic. I thought this would be a one time visit, but will be returning to this $5.99 pizza buffet!!!"}
{"text":"People who work there are great, especially management . It's a great place if you're broke and the kids want pizza. Not the highest quality , but the price is def right on."}
{"text":"Great pizza with a crust you enjoy eating. 
Their wings are pretty decent too.
Great walk-in deals. 
Nice staff."}
{"text":"The worst CiCi's pizza I've ever been to.
I've been to many CiCi's pizzeria's in my life, but this one is the worst by far. The restaurant did not have regular cups to drink out of, so everyone had to drink from to-go cup's. The restaurant also had no silverware, so everyone used plastic forks and knives. Also there were no bowls, so everyone who got pasta, had to use a to-go bowl. Someone tried to get water from the machine, but the machine would only dispense pink lemonade. Also the sauce for the pasta was cold and the noodles were very sub-par. The pizza on the pan was not organized, it was scattered around all over the pan. CiCi's is one off my favorite pizza places because it is inexpensive and a buffet, but after today I will no longer be going to this CiCis. I am highly disappointed and would never recommend this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, great value. LOTS of screaming kids running around."}
{"text":"I love CiCi's! What is better than all-you-can-eat mediocre pizza?! And for those people that complane the pizza is horrible, well what do you really expect from a pizza BUFFET?! If i want high quality pizza, this is not where you go! If you want lots of tasty food that hits the spot, then this is the place! You really do have to grab a cinnamon roll though, mmmmmn!"}
{"text":"The last time I had my friends over to watch the NBA finals I decided to get pizzas from what was a damn good pizza spot. But I think there was some miscommunication. When I told the lady that we need a few pizzas, I think she heard that we need a few shields to fight and defeat Thanos and his infinity gauntlet. 

This thing was well forged, the crust was definitely made from a dying star or maybe a whole galaxy. No mortal or immortal mouths could break this juggernaut. 

So over and all a very bad pizza experience. But I hear DC might release Darksied sometime soon. His omega beams are no match for CiCis Pizza. Pizza Power."}
{"text":"Got delivery. Cheap but very small. Also ordered extra cheese and there was hardly any cheese on it at all. Showed up cold. I added cheese and put it in the oven. Large pizza could hardly feed 2."}
{"text":"We just ordered for the first time, delivery. Honestly, all the chain places and \"quick service\" can bite me. This is our new pizza place. Taxes are already included. The food is delicious. I have no complaints, and that's rare. This is my neighbourhood pizza joint now.  love you guys"}
{"text":"Such good pizza! Prices are a steal, but good quality for any price point. Perfect amount of sauce every time"}
{"text":"Yes, I have a very soft spot for pizza which is definitely contributing to the soft spot on my belly. It's greta when you have a bunch of people together to order a massive special, but even iff you are alone you can get pizza, wings, potato wedges and carrots and celery and a dip for CHEA CHEAP CHEAP!! 

Their pie is very tasty their wings hot when you want them hot and quite speedy delivery. If you are near Parkdale, definitely check out this joint."}
{"text":"I love the selection of pizza here, 2 of my favorites are the buffalo chicken and the macaroni & cheese."}
{"text":"My wife and I are in our early 50's and we are retired. As vegetarians we like to eat at buffets so we have options. We go to Cici's about once a week. The price is great! We go at off-hours, when there are few other diners, like mid-afternoon. The food has most always been fresh, they'll make any kind of pizza you want, the prepared tossed salads are kept fresh, the desserts (especially the cinnamon rolls) are tasty--we have been extremely happy with our Cici's experiences. They have been very accommodating, even willing to turn the music lower when we have asked. For a cheap meal this place is well worth it. Just don't go when they are real busy!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great, ordered it last night for the Blue Jays game. Service was on time couldn't ask for more. Would definitely recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"We love ICcis usually, and love bringing our family but tiday is by far the worst experience we have had at our neighborhood location. WE came in around 1 pm. and with it being the last day of school , many others had decided to do the same thing so it was fairly busy. AS we came in and began to get our food, we noticed that there was not much in the way of pizzas available. We got some pasta and sald, and my girls got a few pieces of pizza that were available. When we went back up about 10 minutes later, there was NO PIZZA No brownies . There was only a few cinnamon rolls and bread sticks. WE watched as the one gentleman in the back was frantically making pizzas and sat back down in the hopes there would be some soon. I few minutes later the man who I believe was the manager was yelling to someone about a Wing order. Whenever we have been there in the past and we had ordered something they would bring it out to you. This man Just YELLED it over everyone. Startling many in the room. We did get a couple of more pieces of pizza, but eventually ended up having to leave not really getting our fill. I had one piece of pizza. I don't know what is going on  there , if they were short handed or ill prepared for the rush they got.( do they not pay attention to things like the last day of school??) but I don't know that I want to take a chance and pay for all 6 of us to go there again and leave hungry and with no  dessert."}
{"text":"It's been a longtime since we have been to a CiCi's. 1st time at this location and the pizza was good. The staff is very helpful. Asked for a veg pizza and it was at our table a few minutes later. Our table was always clean also."}
{"text":"Rand H. and I went to CiCi's Pizza for an early lunch. The second we walked in the door we were greeted with a \" Welcome to CiCi's\"! one from a young lady at the cash register, and two voices from somewhere else in the kitchen. We paid $4.99 and I proceeded past the soup and salad to the row of 15 fresh, hot and tasty pizzas. I enjoyed everything I ate. It was an amazing value!!! If I were to have combined all the pizza I consumed on one plate it would have stood 12 to 14 inches high.... How does this place stay in business? I dunno!!! Mucho Gordo! Four Stars People... . !! 
       Oh . . . as we were finishing our meal the Manager came to our table and asked us how we were doing."}
{"text":"This place is great for families and large groups. Also great place for quick eats for lunch or dinner  They always have a variety of pizza on the buffet but if you do not see your favorite pizza they will make it for you.  The employees are always friendly and helpful at this location."}
{"text":"OMG. Someone wake me up from this bad pizza dream. NEW OWNERS!!!

Ordered CiCi's pizza on Sat night. My bf called and the girl that answered the phone was apparently 12. 

So it seems there are new owners. The crust was doughy, sauce was ok, but it wasn't the CiCi's pizza that my bf and I love.

The wings were okay, I liked them, but I'm mostly sad about the crust and dough. PizzaPizza like dough. *barf*

I'm very sad. Where am I to get a great Za in Parkdale now?"}
{"text":"Gotta come here if you have kids. It's a smaller version of Chuck E. Cheese only cheaper because of the fact that its a buffet. Instead of buying a pizza or two for about 15 bucks a pop, you only pay about 5 bucks for kids 10 and under and its only another dollar for adults! Drinks not included of course but even with that its still a good deal if you are on a budget.

Now for the food. Ehhh.....its alright. But to a kid, its all good! You have a little something for everybody like salad, pasta with your choice of alfredo sauce or marinara, chicken noodle soup, breadsticks, garlic knots and of course pizza! They bring out different kinds once some of the ones that are out are low. Dont like what you see? You can actually request a pizza to be made and they will bring it out to you! They even have desserts like cinnamon rolls and apple pie pizza.

The times I have gone here were when they had customer appreciation day where it was only 2.99 per person. The other times were when they would have lunch specials which are only 5 bucks a person.

Some bonuses are that they have a couple of flat panel LCD's which they usually show the big game if it applies. There is an arcade room towards the back which includes an air hockey table.

Service is decent here and it should be based on the fact that you serve yourself. They usually do a good job of cleaning up any of your excess leftover garbage on your table so be courteous and leave a buck or two for tip.

All in all, this place is a good place to take your kids so you can save some money. Its just that I always have that im full but ate what I really didnt want feeling. Hay, as long as the kids are satisfied, as a parent, that means that you have done your job even though you are sacrificing your own satisfaction.

{"text":"Probably won't be winning any \"Best Of\" awards, but $9.00 gets you a manhole sized pizza, and you will definitely have worse wings at other pizza joints. Their walk in special prices can't be beat and when they say it's ready in 10 minutes, you can take that to the bank. They'd earn a 4th star with a bigger drink selection (very much specifically Tahiti Treat)."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of cicis pizza and always have been. Nothing better than a pizza buffet for a good price"}
{"text":"My 11 year old son always wants to eat here when we are in Las Vegas.  Some of his favorites are the deep dish pizza and macaroni and cheese pizza. you can help your self at the buffet or ask for a special order pizza.  For dessert, there is a delicious cinnamon roll pizza. if you are not a pizza lover, you can always from the salad bar and pasta bar."}
{"text":"CiCi's Pizza has always been a staple in Huntersville. They have most likely been the longest tenant in the Rosedale Shopping Center. And that's got to mean something, right? I remember coming here during high school with my friends and slowly tapering away as I started to branch out.

Nowadays, I come here solely during my hourly lunch breaks when I'm craving pizza and soup. For an all you can eat buffet, you can't complain on the price. Under $7 for a meal and a drink? I'll take that. You get what you expect though for that price. Small pizza slices with little sauce, cheese, and meat. Nearly 1/2 of a slice is the crust and the rest is the lightly sprinkled pizza toppings. Folks, I'm not expecting top quality pizzas or anything like that; however, when the pizza is basically just tomato sauce and cheese, you feel cheated. 

Their soup and salads are mediocre at best. The usual salad options which come from big bags of prepared salad mix. Soups that lack any flavor or base; the noodles and chicken tend to be mushy. Just your typical soup and salad at a buffet, basically.

Service is excellent and they're ready to make something you want at any time. And you're bound to get the 'Welcome to Cici's\" greeting when you walk in. 

If you need something quick and easy, but want something where you can sit down and eat, come to Cici's. Don't expect top-notch pizza and seasonings though, just something to fill you up before dinner."}
{"text":"I went to CiCi's for lunch today since with was raining and seemed like a pizza type day. People may be wondering why someone would give 4 stars for CiCi's Pizza. Well for starters, the cost of my lunch was $6.04 for all you can eat pizza, soft drink, salad, soup and desert. I don't waste my stomach on soup and salad. 

Their Cinnamon Buns are decadent and delish and the main reason for the 4 star rating. For the price of desert at a Claim Jumpers or similar type establishment you get dessert plus the main course at CiCi's. Now the pizza is not the greatest in the world but it is way better than most pizza joints I've been to in the metro Phoenix area. This place is affordable for families. And if you don't see a pizza you like, you can order a specially made pizza and they will deliver it to your table at no extra charge."}
{"text":"Quite honestly, I was a bit unsure about this place.  Cause the last Cici's we went too, made us think twice about eating there.  This Cici's Pizza,  thrown those doubts out the window and became our favorite place to have pizza.  

Located off North Decatur and 215, behind Walgreens, and next to Best Buy, is Cici's Pizza.  Took us a while to find it, since we weren't really use to the area.  But, it is a decent size to have a pizza buffet.  I like the fact that it has a door way that you could only enter threw, and a doorway you could only exit out.  So you won't be bombarded with little kids running in and out, when you're trying to get in, or out.  The dining area is very well kept in a cleanly setting.  Enough room to have a decent size birthday party.  As well as an arcade room in the back.  The staff seem very friendly, and very alert.  They make sure that you are greeted, once you walk in.  

As far as the buffet line goes, its fresh as it can get.  Salad bar look fresh and they have some one behind the counter, to put dressing on your salad.  The pizza looks good and never hard to chew.  What kind of interest me, is the different kind of pizza they had.  Like the Macaroni Pizza, which was different but really good.  Of course the usual pepperoni pizza is my favorite.  What topped it all off was the cinnamon rolls.  Very tasty and very soft, it had to be one of the best things about Cici's.  

It got to the point that we decided to order from Cici's To Go menu, every time we wanted pizza and cinnamon rolls.  Plus their pricing is really really good.  2 medium pizza, large bread sticks, and large cinnamon rolls for under 20 bucks.  Guess what's for dinner!?!?

Overall, a well recommended place for pizza lovers who are looking for a cheap place to have good pizza and dessert at a buffet restaurant.  Also a good place for take out as well."}
{"text":"So have had my eyes on this place since we moved into town - FINALLY got the chance to go in last night!!!!

From the curbside, this place does NOT look like it holds a lot - but looks can be deceiving! The space is huge inside! And you can easily fit large groups in without a problem.

Single Buffet price is $5.49, then you pay for the drink on top of that. Those who are military - you basically get the soda fountain for free.

You can get the salad bar, pasta dishes, and of course the pizza's galore! You do have to fight the battle line at the buffet area. Getting past the battle at the line - the service is awesome from the staff! Staff are very quick to offer to make you a pizza if they see the piece you were going for is taken away before you get to it. Or if the pizza you wanted is not around, they will of course make it available to you.

My particular favorites last night were the spinach pizza (yup, I'm the female version of Popeye, just my arms don't get super big after eating it!), veggie pizza, and a herb pizza (had lots of italian flavors, with olive oil and garlic - VERY tasty). Cinnamon rolls were scruuuumptious! The brownies - eh - not my fav, but ok. And the dessert pizza - a little much on the sugar overload - but the cinnamon rolls were juuust perfect.

Staff are also very good at swinging by your tables to pick up the used plates, without disturbing the flow of your conversation with others. (They almost sneak attack in - but it's awesome how well they do it with hardly being noticed!) And when you get too caught up in the conversation - there are employees who are more than willing to come out carrying a pizza in tow fresh from the oven ready to serve you table side! They aim to please! And they will swing by your table to ensure you are happy about your service!

There is a back room - which is a mini arcade to entertain your ants in the pants little ones old enough to game.

It's not obvious where the restrooms are - ya have to look around - they are located in the arcade area.

Final verdict - fun night out for all!"}
{"text":"As a parent with 3 hungry children, CiCi's is a great choice for dining out.  Great price and the food really is pretty decent.  The fact that it is all you can eat makes it a great value.  The employees have always been very friendly.  I love the fact that you can make a special request for a pizza that they don't already have made and they will gladly fix it up for you."}
{"text":"Ugh.... Cici's Pizza buffet ugh.... This is what I now say whenever I see a Cici's Pizza buffet commercial.  Why you ask? because it is a buffet.

The first time we came to Cici's it was the greatest thing ever! all the cheap pizza you can eat? Yes please!  Second time there, still good but not as much excitement... Third time... ugh.... Cici's Pizza buffet ugh....  Needless to say, it's great for cheap pizza  but don't expect anything spectacular, it's cheap pizza."}
{"text":"This location is the closest to my house, it's a pizza buffet, you can't screw it up too bad. The service is inconsistent and other patrons can be bothersome. I think that should of maintained whatever customer service they had before but they seem to play favorites with customers. We had to get our own high chair, which was fine but another party they doted on, got their high chairs, moved other chairs out of the way and went the extra mile for them (it was busier when they showed up). I don't like how they conduct managerial tasks up at the front phones. I'll keep going here as its not a badly priced and the pizza is good."}
{"text":"Cici's pizza is great for families. The staff here is always very friendly.  They work hard to keep the place clean, and turn over the buffet quickly. They will take custom orders if you do not see a pizza you like.  You have to try their speciality pizzas as they are unique and tasty.  Now, do not expect the best Chicago style or Brooklyn pizza you have ever eaten or you will be disappointed, but for $4.99 all you can eat you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"When I was young my parents used to tell me that we would all meet up again in Heaven. At the time it seemed pleasant and relieving to think that I could just do my own thing now and catch up with everyone after we were all nuked to death in the zombie apocalypse.

And then it dawned on me that Heaven might not be my scene. I imagined an afterlife where I was forced to spend all of eternity with all the gun-toting, bible-beating homo/xenophobes I spent my whole life antagonizing. Them looking all fucking smug and happy, Peaches Christ it makes me want to throw a shark at a mailman.

So I have since decided that I will do whatever it takes to get into Hell. With all the drinking and sexing and, you know, changing my gender and all, I'm sure eventually I'll check off enough boxes to get me a backstage pass to Damnation. 

I occasionally burn down a village and smash a goblin's head in with a rock just in case I can get into Valhalla. 

Yeah.

So Ci Ci's Pizza.

Just like that.

It sounds like heaven. A pizza buffet under 7 dollars. As much pizza, soup, salad, and dessert you could ever gorge yourself on. Every variety of pizza you could imagine. Fettuccine and spinach pizza. Taco pizza. Hawaiian pizza. Macaroni and cheese pizza. BBQ chicken pizza. 

And like the meal dispensing machines from \"Red Dwarf\", the kitchen is infinitely flexible. Want a flavor of pizza not currently available on the buffet line? They'll special make it. Just. For. You. They'll even send out one of their underpaid lackeys to bring it out to you on a tray, like a secret waiter without dignity who won't expect a tip.

Ahh yes. It's a venerable heaven for a pizza lover.

Until you realize it's everybody else's heaven. Everybody else you hate.

Parents who bring their five kids because Little Timmy hasn't developed table manners yet and would just embarrass them at a real restaurant. 

The unreasonably picky eater who keeps taking one slice of each pizza on the line, taking the smallest of bites, and deciding its too salty too cheesy too saucy for his tastes and throws it away, forcing you and the staff to watch at least three whole pizzas thrown away before he finds a flavor he likes.

The family that wisely figures that since Grandma has a hard enough time walking to Red Lobster, they might as well bring her somewhere she'll have to give her legs some exercise just to get some salad.

All the underpaid, bitter and apathetic high schoolers who all lost their jobs at Harkins when they showed up for work with their name tag missing...THE THIRD TIME THIS MONTH!

It's a shame Ci Ci's has such a suck infestation. Because they'll probably be shut down by the health inspector before anyone realizes that they aren't just pizza makers; they're wizards. No, alchemists.

Only an alchemist schooled by The Beast himself would be able to take a lump of dough and make it into breadsticks, pizza, cheese bread, cinnamon rolls, and apple pie.

This isn't just a cutesy metaphor. It's seriously the same dough. 

Fun Fact: The first time I came here I was approached by a manager and offered a job, not based on my experience in the food industry or my impeccable customer service, but because I had a quirky t-shirt on. 

\"You have the sense of humor needed for this.\"

Funny. I imagine Peter saying the same thing to me once I get to the front desk at the Pearly Gates.

For the love of trolls, Odin. Give me a sign already."}
{"text":"i figured it out, Young people especially kids and teens have no frigging taste buds, cardboard garbage, but as I looked around all the kids and teens were dogging it out going back for more and having so much fun.. I just dont get it....No taste buds"}
{"text":"I came here because I kept seeing their commercials on TV for their $5.00 September buffet and since I was in the area I decided to try it out.

Let me tell you, the commercials were misleading.  I thought there was going to be a long row of pizza.  Instead it was a small little section of pizza.  I kind of liked it this small because sometimes the big buffet can be overwhelming.  The best part is that if you don't see a pizza you like, you can ask for a specific one and hey will make it for you and deliver it to your table.  How awesome is that?!?!?

I'm not a huge fan of pizza (only because the ones I tried hasn't really been the one to say \"this is the best pizza ever) and I cant say this is the best pizza I ever tried nor is it the worse.  This is a good place to fill up on pizza on little $."}
{"text":"So, don't hate me but I love Cici's Pizza.  Period.  Now, let me say upfront that I grew up on East Coast pizza.  All styles and all quality.  I also have to say, pizza would be my last meal on earth (probably).  With that said, some people might turn their nose down at Cici's.  But not me.  I love the crust, the cheese isn't gooey and the toppings work.  We're talking buffet here folks, so gluttony is the word of the day.  Well, okay, you don't have to fill yourself to the rim, but you can enjoy good pizza, salad, bread sticks and more, for less than some cups of coffee.  And I don't feel bloated when I'm finished like some pizza can do.

This Cici's location is nice.  Large space inside and it seats a bunch.  Have a large party for kids?  This is the place to go.  The staff is friendly, as you should find at all locations.  This staff seemed extra attentive.  Don't see the pizza you had in mind on the buffet line?  Ask and they will have one for you quicker than you'd expect.  Tell them the number of slices you'd like or just ask for the whole thing.  The tables were clean.  They do a good job of cleaning up used plates and such, as you use them.  So, yeah, that's about it."}
{"text":"Ci Ci's is awesome. I use to go all the time when I lived in Louisiana and was stoked to see them here in AZ. For only a few bucks you can stuff your face with mediocre pizza, pasta and salad. Its great, seriously. They have tons of different types of pizza and you can even request a pizza and they will make it for free. They have Mac N' Cheese pizza, taco pizza, white pizza, spinach  pizza and all the regulars. In Louisiana they even has shrimp alfredo pizza every friday. Their cinnamon rolls at the dessert bar are awesome when they are fresh out of the oven. Just humble yourself and go."}
{"text":"So I heard good things of CiCi's Pizza and seeing I live near the place decided i'd give it a try.

So the first thing I noticed was the place was pretty small and not much to it. No tables or places to eat, Just a few stools for waiting for your order. So we ordered meal 3. What we got was wedges, wings, extra large pizza with 3 toppings, 4 pop and a dipping sauce. All for under $30 which is a great price.

As for quality all were decent, Could have been more cheese on the pizza, and tasted a little under cooked. The wings were the best thing of our meal. 

So all said it really comes down to the price. For what your paying your getting your money's worth plus. I wouldn't recommend somebody going out of their way for this place but if you live in the area go for it. 

Even with such a great price delivery is free!!! Can't beat that"}
{"text":"OK! Watching the commercials on TV for this place, I've always wanted to try this buffet but none exist in the Bay Area. I've been teased long enough! Finally had my fill at this Cici's in Vegas and I was more than satisfied. The pizzas keep coming out fresh, and if it's not out on the line, they take requests. 

I especially like their Mexican Style Ole, their Pepperoni/Jalepeno, and something they called The Flip (a calzone style pizza). I've got to give honorable mention to their freshly tossed salad, but c'mon, salad is salad; and the pasta? eh...it's ok. Oh here's the kicker...their fresh out-of-the-oven cinnamon buns...they just hit the spot after all that pizza!

Customer service was great. They have a friendly and attentive staff. The place was always clean. I'm going back!"}
{"text":"ordered 30 wings - 15 med, 15 hot - no celery sticks, $1 each for commercial tublets of blue cheese dressing - medium sauce  was sparse, hot were hot for 15 min - wings were kinda small too - guess i learned to NOT save a few bucks and sacrifice quality - service was weird too - i can't believe she compared her wings to duff's - not even close - i will go to duff's on tuesday nite for their special"}
{"text":"Awesome family run business!
Always fair priced food, and best pizza. In Parkdale!
Such a beautiful family :)"}
{"text":"Normally I try not going to any type of buffets because I try to eat my weight to get my money's worth, then I cannot move and need to be rolled out to the car.  For this lunch trip I did not know where we were going, the \"boys\" at work picked it.  We rolled in the parking lot and I was like OMG it is a pizza buffet and I am not equipped.  I need my stretchy pants not the tight jeans.  LOL!  

The place was pretty quiet.  Only three other tables there.  You filed in a single filed and paid.  You walk down the path and find pizzas, salad, breads, pastas, soups, and deserts in LIGHTS!  All flashy and have that pick me sign hanging over them.  The pizza was ok, too doughy for me.  Everything else tasted like canned foods you re-heat at home.  I know it is super cheap and you should not expect gourmet pizza or anything.  So you get what you paid for!"}
{"text":"Cici's is just down the street from me so I have stopped in for lunch three or four times. I'm surprised I returned after my first experience because that time there were more tables piled high with dirty plates than clean tables when I went to sit down. There were noisy kids running all over.

All of the times I visited for lunch after that have been fine and happily uneventful. After paying $4.00 plus drink for my lunch, I asked for a spinach pizza. They made it for me and brought me a few slices shortly after I finished my salad.

I LOVE the Cinnabon dessert and unlimited Dr. Pepper. She'll be baaaaack!"}
{"text":"The pizza isn't the greatest in the world, but it will do....especially when it's all you can eat for $7!  My friend lives around the corner, so he recommended coming here for lunch.

I didn't know what to expect, but was happy to find a really clean place.  The restaurant was about 1/2 full during lunchtime on a Tuesday.  On the buffet line you will find at least 12 to 15 different pizzas.  Since I love Pizza and can eat it morning, noon, and night I was in heaven.  I was about to screw up all of my efforts from the morning workout.

Here's a list of what I can remember eating...the slices are small, so it's not as much as it appears...although it was a lot!

Pepperoni - Regular Crust
Pepperoni - Thick Crust
Pepperoni - Thin Crust
Pepperoni & Jalapenos
Macaroni & Cheese - Yes, it's a pizza!  It was just ok though.
Ham & Cheese
Veggie Thin Crust
Mushroom & Pepperoni
Pepperoni & Sausage

There were many others that I didn't try.....BBQ Chicken, Hawaiian, and several I can't remember.  Overall, it was great value for the money.

The people who work here are very friendly too.  They greeted everyone who entered the door & everyone who left.....and it sounded sincere not fake.

There was a small selection of video games & other games in the back room and tv's.

Will I come back?  When I want to gain 500 lbs....yes!"}
{"text":"I know, I know it's been a long time since I've done a review but I've been busy trying to lose weight.  After 5 months of trying and losing maybe 5 pounds I decided ah, what the hell?  Might as well go back to doing some reviews!  Being away from Yelp wasn't helping my quest for six-pack abbage anyway.  That's what the extra cardio is for!

Now I've been to several of the Cici's here in LV and I'm reviewing this one mainly because it's the nicest one I've been to.  Cleanliness is very important folks!  The manager treats me well here so kudos to him and his staff.  Plus, this one is in the same shopping center as Best Buy and Costco!  Killin' all the birds with one stone.  Assassin's Creed 2 video game?  Check.  Fiber One bars?  Check.  Cheap but tasty lunch?  Check.

This place gets 3 1/2 stars from me.  Pretty good in my book.  I know other places have much better pizza, but you gotta give it to Cici's for attracting all the folks with a $4.99 all-you-can-eat pizza buffet.  Where else you gonna go that's this cheap and also keeps the kids happy?  This place is hoppin' it seems almost all times of the day, especially the weekends.  They even got a little arcade in there so they can suck a little bit more of your money before you leave!

But back to the food.  Once you pay for your meal, you get started off at the salad bar.  I eat tons of their salad when the server makes it with fresh ingredients (not sitting long) and the ratios are correct (not too much dressing).  Cici's has 2 basic salads, their 'House' Italian salad with lettuce mix, tomatoes, red onion, banana peppers, olives, and their special dressing.  I swear to God, this salad tastes almost exactly like the salad at Olive Garden!  And that's a good thing (if you like Olive Garden's salad...which I do).  They also make a decent Bacon Ranch salad with lettuce mix, bacon bits, tomatoes, and ranch dressing.  I hear in other states with a Cici's Pizza they have a full salad bar available (I'm lookin at you Austin, TX), I wish they would do that here in Vegas too.  That would inch you up probably to a full 4 stars.  

After you pass the salad options you get to the soup/pasta station.  Yes, they only have one soup that I've ever seen but it's very good when it's fresh.  It's a chicken noodle soup made with their popular rotini pasta (yummy yes, traditional no).  Good soup with lots of chicken cubes, rotini, onion, peppers, lots of spices.  Goes great with their garlic breadstics.  They also have a pasta option, which is always rotini pasta with marinara.

But you all know we came here for the show...the pizza!  Cici's has at least a dozen different pizzas on their serving line at any one time, and the variety is vast.  Key here is to get it while it's fresh...always tastes the best.   Some of my favs are the Thin Crust Italiano (thin and crispy with sausage and spices), the Zesty Veggie (fresh veggies with a zesty ranch sauce), the Mexican Ole! (thin crust with ground beef and cheese, topped with fresh lettuce and tomato), the Hawaiian (ham and pineapple), the BBQ (pork BBQ with cheddar and mozzarella),  and the Buffalo Chicken (chicken breast with spicy ranch sauce and buffalo wing sauce).  I also like their Deep Dish pizza a lot with my fav being the Supreme (pepperoni, sausage, peppers, onions, olives, mushrooms, cheese).  Of course the kids love their signature Macaroni & Cheese pizza!

Here's a tip that many of you might not know, you can special order a pizza at Cici's at any time while dining in.  Just tell the server behind the counter you have a special request.  They'll ask what kind of pizza you want and how many slices.  Then they ask your name and give you a colored cone for your order.  When it's ready it's brought straight to your table!  I always order a Supreme pizza this way.  I order a whole one and share it with my family.  This way it comes out hot, fresh, and not touched by some kid with booger hands!

They also have a small dessert and drink station.  Cici's makes some decent brownies, but their cinnamon rolls?  They're addictive, like crack!  Their excellent when they are just out of the oven, warm, gooey, light, and fluffy all at the same time.  You'd be hard pressed to find another decent cinnamon roll in this city.  I'm also very happy that Cici's is a Coke serving place, so drink away I do!  I just wish they had Cherry Coke on tap (Sam's Club I hate you...but love that you have this on tap).

Little known fact:  Cici's Pizza was voted one of 'America's Healthiest Restaurants' by Men's Health magazine in 2009.  Hurts soooo good!  

Overall, not a bad place to stuff yourself silly off of fat and carbs...and for the same price as a Subway $5 footlong!  Just save some room so you can stand and play the 'Stacker' game in the arcade afterwards.  One day I will win that damn big prize!"}
{"text":"The pizza was ok here...it's not much you can choose from. But, for $5 what more do you expect?? No waiter service. You serve yourself. But, if you want a different kind of pizza that isn't on the counter you can order it and they'll bring it to you.

It doesn't busy here, so you don't have to worry about waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Gourmet, this place just ain't it.  Edible and cheap, we have a winner.  I've only eaten here once but, since moving the area this is my go-to for take out.  They can get a pile of pizza ready to go in ten minutes and I can be out the door with four huge boxes of food for less than twenty bucks.  I can't complain about that.  The staff have always been friendly over the phone and in person.  The time that I did stay to dine in the line was taken care of with plenty of choices and pies coming out every few minutes.  The bread sticks are yummy and you can't go wrong with the cinnamon rolls.  Again, don't cry that it's not super fabulous, you get what you pay for.  For a budget minded gal with a healthy appetite I'm certainly a fan."}
{"text":"Ahhhh Cici's Pizza... what can I say?

My first experience here a year ago at a different location was not good at all. I seen a 3.99$ price and was sad since they closed down the Pizza Hut Buffet by my house so opted for this place. 

When you first walk in theyre very nice with their standard \"Welcome to Cici's!!\" welcome. Our cashier was very friendly and we paid. For drinks its 1.89$ for a small and 2.29$ for a large, childrens drinks are .99$. We got a seat and proceeded to the buffet, Im not a fan of pre-made salads and here they offer only 2 choices, a blt ranch, and some Italian one. I opted for the blt. I went on to get breadsticks and was excited when I seen the deep dish and macaroni pizza. I sat down to try all my yummies. The salad was meh and the macaroni pizza was ok. The deep dish was def yum, and I was surprised I liked it bc it had white sauce on it.

They also special make slices for you! I get the deep dish with pepperoni and jalapeno, super yummy!!

Come here for cheap eats and pizza! Right now the buffet is only 3.99$ which is a killer deal for pizza!"}
{"text":"After calling two other locations that didn't honor the online value packs because they are just \"corporate offers\" I talked to the manager at this location. Not only did he help me find the best deal for my 10 large pizzas, dessert, and cheese sticks...but he also carried it all out to my car for me in the pouring rain. Even after I told him I could handle it. GREAT customer service!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for kids, average to below average for adults.  Friendly staff, good price.  Not the best tasting, but you can tolerate a slice or 2.  Limited dessert and salad options."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal, the pizza was soft, salad was fresh, soup was warm on a cold day, tea was good, cinnamon rolls were best, brownies a little under done. Wish there were more veggies and toppings on the pizzas. Left satisfied, friendly staff, happy children playing, happy group sitting next to us."}
{"text":"OMG this place is soooooo yummy!!!!  It's a buffet of pizzas!  Pepperoni, sausage, buffalo chicken.  Even macaroni and cheese pizza.  Cheeseburger pizza.  Just pizza overload.  YUM!  There's also salad, usually some kind of pasta and a few desserts.  If you're on a budget or just plain craving pizza, give it a try.  It's not the world's best pizza but it's so yummy!!  It's like $7 for all you can eat pizza!  Seriously!"}
{"text":"Not as many screaming kids as I thought there would be.  Only two things I felt were worth mentioning, the mac and cheese pizza and the cinnamon sticks, otherwise ok food. Not bad for the price tag."}
{"text":"Can't beat the price
For 5 bucks!!
The service is  better than some fine dining  restaurants in same complex ."}
{"text":"Quick buffet that is good for kids. Limited salad bar so don't plan on eating healthy. There is a small arcade and the prices are cheap but do realize you get what you pay for. Definitely not high quality food here."}
{"text":"Max from this location was amazing and just because of him I would definitely come back.  He was so fun and helpful!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Cici's pizza is ok. It's cheap pizza for lunch. Their price matches their quality.  Service is nice and they are willing to make a special pizza/slice for you if requested.  

Their brownies and cinnamon rolls are FANTASTIC though.  

I'd go back."}
{"text":"Abondanza! 

Already hooked on Cici's. We tried it for the first time a few weeks back when they had a $3.99 special and we go every week now. Cheap, decent quality, awesome quantity and incredibly friendly people. (and NFL Network on the tv don't hurt)

Buffet style pizza, two types of salad - premixed with either ranch or italian dressing, some kind of corkscrew pasta that's the one lowlight - just avoid it and save the tummy space for the 'za, and cinnamon rolls and brownies that are to die for. Oh, and aycd fountain drinks and tea (sweet tea, too!), of course. There's always bread sticks and some sort of stuffed-pizza'y-squares-concoction that I kinda dig, too.

It's not the greatest pizza on the planet, but there's plenty of it and plenty of variety. I like the buffalo chicken, mac and cheese, and veggie as my favorite little triangles of goodness. You'll be greeted with lots of hello's and smiles when you walk in, everyone is super friendly and will get you anything you need if you don't see it on the buffet. They keep the pizza fresh and rarely will you see an empty pan on the counter.

For the money, it's a steal, they just need bigger plates! It's always interesting to watch the gluttons build a \"Leaning Tower of Pizza\" rather than just eat a few slices and make their way back.

Ciao! (or, i guess it should be, Chow!)"}
{"text":"Ok so this may be partly my fault...I had never been to a Cici's Pizza before and had expected a lot more out of the experience. 

The only thing I thought was good was the cinnamon roll things. Everything else was not great...or not available. There was no salad or pasta available the entire time we were eating (we were there for about 25 minutes).

I guess you get what you pay for here. It's cheap."}
{"text":"Shame on you for the low sanitation score of a B-83. Clean up your act!! We will not eat here again until the score has gone way up."}
{"text":"Upon entry I was greeted with a smile by almost every staff member on duty. Manager Kim and staff members Brianna and Trevor were at the counter. When I advised two adults and two children Kim asked my kids ages and explained they would be free due to age. They even added our military discount. During our dinner services I watched staff clean their food and common areas almost every 5-6 mins and even helped each other out without question. When I asked about a certain flavor pizza they quickly made it to order with a smile. I watched staff swap out pizza that sat there untouched for about 10 mins. Replacing it with fresh, hot ones. Their pizza was always hot, fresh, and delicious! Many staff stopped by our table to make sure everything was perfect. We watched the smiles on the staffs faces every time someone walked through the door. Staffed danced to the music with smiles on their faces as if they enjoyed their jobs and their management. Awesome job! You've gained a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I feel like none of their food is good except the Bavarian pizza and it's a dessert. Staff is really friendly but the pizzas taste like cardboard . However , it is an extremely affordable buffet."}
{"text":"Finally!  After watching all those damn commercials...and being deprived of this chain in NorCal, I had an opportunity to visit this fairly new restaurant in Las Vegas.  

Right when I walked in, and throughout my whole dining experience, there were a few things that really stood out.  For an all day buffet...this restaurant was surprisingly clean.  From the buffet bar to the tables, I noticed that the staff was attentive and quick in creating a presentable and sanitary dining environment.  And they were so darn friendly and full of life!  I wish I had that much energy at my work!

All-you-can-eat pizza was shockingly impressive!  I was fortunate to always get fresh, hot, crispy-crusted pizzas.  I enjoyed most of their specialty pizzas:  Spinach Alfredo, BBQ Buffalo Chicken, Mac & Cheese, Zesty Pepperoni (also in deep dish), Alfredo, and Mexican Style Ole (taco).  The regular one/two topping pizzas weren't bad either.  

One of my favorite items was the Flip, a seasoned pocket style pizza with pepperoni and cheese.  Their tossed signature salads were okay.  I thought that the BLT Ranch was better than the Classic Italian.  I didn't have room for their soup or pasta...since I was eyeing their freshly baked brownies and cinnamon rolls.  Brownies were too moist for me, but their hot cinnamon rolls may be the reason why I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Best Cici's location I've eaten at so far.  The marinara is better and less watery than some locations.  The management staff is very good and very accommodating.  This place is perfect for birthday parties or after little league.  This is not gourmet pizza, but.....for a Cici's it gets 4 stars.

Only complaints.....Cici's quit being so cheap and actually put cheese as a topping on the salad bar....and get some better arcade games and better prizes in the prize crane game.  Gotta love the sticker vending machine that dispenses tramp stamp tattoos....classy....only in Monroe."}
{"text":"Yeah, I had to check it out for the little ones. I went on a Saturday night around 6pm, which may have been my first mistake.

The place was sooo loud and insane, it was like Chucky Cheese, without the distraction of the arcade games for the kids. The line for the drink machine was ridiculous. There were 8 people in front of me! I tried the salad with the Italian dressing, which wasn't bad although a bit wilted. The pizza was a joke. I tried the Mac and Cheese, BBQ, Ham and cheese, and the pan cheese pizza. If I had to choose one it would be the Mac and Cheese that was almost decent. The pizza dough was flavorless and quite similar to cardboard. The bread sticks had to be my favorite thing, because they were the only thing that I could stand to eat more than one bite of.  I couldn't even bring myself to try the cinnamon rolls or brownies.  My Mother-in-law ordered the chicken wings...which I would like to refer to as Mistake #2. They were like microwaved frozen wings, completely soggy and disgusting. She ordered mild, yet they were drenched in a hot sauce that the kids thought were too spicy. I tried one and it was alot hotter than mild. 

The only reason I'm not giving this place 1 star is because the service was actually commendable. The bus persons kept the place clean and swarmed the tables as soon as people left. The people making the pizza were also quick to put in special requests as well. 

I think I'll stick with Chucky Cheese next time. At least there I can MAKE my own salad and the kids are preoccupied by arcade games."}
{"text":"Every time we go there we are treated like royalty from manager Jacob. He always gets our special pizza correct and it's delicious. Great place and very reasonable prices especially for us seniors on a limited income."}
{"text":"For the walk-in price, it's good. I got the large $6.99 pizza ($7.80 with tax). My one topping was extra cheese. 

problem is, there was barely any cheese on it, and this was an extra cheese pizza! 

But for the price, it's a great deal. If you want extra cheese, however, you'll have to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Awe man I don't know what I was smoking when I decided to go in here lol, the food isn't satisfying and u might think since it's super cheap u want to stuff ur face, u won't want to!"}
{"text":"Worth it!  As long as you don't expect gourmet pizza, you're gonna like CiCi's.  They have about 6 - 8 pizzas out on the buffet at any given time and it is always hot.  They have pasta and a small salad bar.  It's a great way to get a pizza fix because you're not stuck with the same pizza.  Want buffalo chicken?  Next a mac & cheese?  Then you can finish off with one of their many desserts.  They have 2 dessert pizzas and brownies.  Plenty of seating and a game room in the back!"}
{"text":"I remember the last time I was here. Of course it's closed now. the last time I was at this location, I noticed that it was mostly deserted, except for some teenagers that were clearly gang members or something. One of the young guys kept trying to flirt with a woman that worked there. She was kinda cute...about my age. She kept shooting down his advances as politely as she could but he kept flirting with her. A seventeen year old punk trying to hit on a woman of thirty years old...that's unsettling in a way.

The pizza was okay if you enjoy thin, tasteless crust and bland cheese w/ toppings. But I must congratulate them on their attempt at variety. The drink station wasn't bad but it could have been better. While they had plenty of various refreshing soft drinks, the area was almost always wet with soda puddles.

I can't say I'm unhappy this location is closed. But I sure hope the woman who worked there has a better job now."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I visited Cici's.  With Mom in town, she wanted to experience all you can eat pizza.  She was not disappointed.  The pizza was hot and fresh and the flavors were varied (buffalo chicken, spinach, macaroni & cheese, pepperoni with jalapenos...) I could go on.  The buffet includes salad items and a couple soups - they were almost empty when I checked.  In any case, I ate my pizza, had more pizza, and then started on the dessert pizza.  The flavor was like a cinnamon bun...I had several slices.  All in all, Mom enjoyed the dinner, I enjoyed the dinner, and the kids enjoyed eating what they wanted.  I gave the kids fifty cents for the arcade area and then it was time to go.  This is something you will have to keep a handle on with the kids.  I look forward to returning to Cici's especially since I have a $3.99 coupon (reg. price is $5.19) for completing an online survey!"}
{"text":"For some reason Ci Ci's has never made it to California which would explain why I'd never heard of it til I moved here. Went here last week with some friends away from our usual area a few blocks north on Indian School. Geez, what a difference a few blocks makes. 

Don't get me wrong, I appreciated Ci Ci's \"recession prices\" of $3.99 for the buffet. That is hard to beat. But it's also the big draw for the crowd that was in there. No sign of any urban hipsters or young professionals. Quite a few mallrat-types or guys engaged in some sort of eating contest--I suppose they could have just been hungry. And I don't mean to sound harsh or judgmental, but it's depressing seeing that person who is not just eating by himself, but clearly overeating. Actually the overeating was also being done by a couple of groups of very obese people. 

As for the food, the buffet I suppose was worth about $3.99. There are two salad choices. The bowl with the one I wanted, tossed with Italian dressing, was almost gone when I got there. It seemed like they never bothered to make a full bowl for the rest of the time they were open. The soup didn't look very appetizing. The pasta option was just elbow macaroni that looked like it had been tossed in canned tomato sauce. The pizza was fine. It didn't have any unique flavors. The combo I did like, surprisingly, was the mac and cheese pizza. No sauce, just cheese--orange the way it should be when dealing with macaroni. Figures I'd like the one choice that would make one's carb allowance skyrocket. I skipped dessert so no idea if their brownies and cinnamon rolls were any good.

The staff was nice though. The clerk politely explained the choices to us old-timers. And they will make a whole pizza if there's a combination you want. Still, I won't be in a big hurry to eat here anytime soon."}
{"text":"After years of patronage I've stopped going there. Ordered a walk in special, they completely cheaped out in everything, especially the cheese, not even covering the pie. The FU attitude when I asked about it has sealed it for me. Go anywhere else, a business that does these things doesn't deserve a cent from you."}
{"text":"Pizza, as pizza is supposed to be: convenient and cheap and full of flavour and made with the right stuff.

This is the pizza of my youth; from the days when Toronto was filled with Italian immigrants, and there were small family-run Italian restaurants all over - before they all became real estate tycoons and moved to Vaughan and Concord.

...yes, I am getting gawddamned old.

This pizza should be a revelation to you young'uns brought up in a world of Pizza Pizza and Dominos. Crusts that taste like an Italian bread you'd be happy to eat on its own - not the rubbery thick dough of the aforementioned chains, nor the cracker-crusts of the trendy wood-oven joints, but a perfect platform for generous toppings. Covered with cheese that has flavor, and is neither gooey nor elastic. And tomato sauce that tastes like tomatoes. 

Is everybody starting to get it?

This is one of the last old-school pizzas in town - right down to their pricing: a large 4-item delivered for $15.

 I'd been paying almost twice that from King Slice. And King Slice is good, and they know it - but Cici's is better."}
{"text":"I love a good cheap slice of chewy, hot pizza from a take out joint. 

The vegetarian and pepperoni slices from CiCi's always hit the spot. I've only had it with my wee one on long walks in the hood, but I think I'm going to try one of their hot, fresh pies soon! 

Sweet staff, sweet slices, takes all payments. CiCi is as cool as it comes, and is a Parkdale staple."}
{"text":"It's just a great value and a no-brainier ! This location in Monroe is always clean and staff is super friendly . It's a win win"}
{"text":"This used to be a decent place to go.  Things have changed. It's dirty, the quality has gone way down, there aren't trays anymore, paper cups, plastic utensils, etc.  There were several items we are used to that weren't on the buffet. There are less tables.   The women's bathroom was disgusting.  I don't think we will be back."}
