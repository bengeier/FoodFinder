{"text":"Excellent food and attention.  Hamburgers are very satisfying, big portions and well done. Low prices.  I will go  back."}
{"text":"we went on a Groupon and were relly pleased..great concept of Quebecoise stye food in a fast food eatery that has a classy and sit down area.   The creton starter was fantastic..too much but you can take home the little jar for later.   Our burgers were devine..nothing to complain about...I had the duck, done perfectly and my fries were hot and overflowing. My man had the surf and turf and just adored it.   We had a surprise little ice cream at the end with a cabane a sucre topping..in a sucre a la creme with crunchy bits.   Only 2 people working..but we ate quickly. I will go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers an exceptionally brutal experience. Expensive burgers that are mediocre, a lack of ingredients for basic menu items like salads. A useless waiter who got everything wrong. My friend ordered his burger without cheese, and when it first arrived with cheese, he sent it back, and the damned thing came back with the cheese Half heartedly scraped off.  Never going back. So bad I'm embarrassed I invited friends there. And the elevator music and fake kitch d√©cor made me want to blow out my brains by the end of the ordeal."}
