{"text":"Really good food for for the price. Portions are also large on what I've ordered.  I've been here twice and each time the staff has been very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! We are fairly new to Pittsburgh and found Armstrong's by happy accident. :-) Enjoyed fresh, hot, delicious homemade mushroom soup. For spicy food lovers...the hot stuffed banana peppers are a MUST! Not a bad thing on this menu. Portions and presentation are great. Dine in section is small but adequate and very clean."}
{"text":"The food especially the meatballs and penne vodka are consistently delicious.  The wings are great as well.    This last order we tried the garlic Parmesan wings and the were outstanding.  I tried the corned beef bistro sandwich and I didn't see on the menu it had fries and slaw on the sandwich but it was overstuffed and just delicious.   We have always ordered from here but after 3 bad takeout ordered from bj brew house we will probably order more often.  Great food great service great portions."}
{"text":"This is a great hidden spot in Bridgeville

They have great food and what I think is the best cheeseburger

I normally call in and get me food for pickup but they have a few seat by the window."}
{"text":"Been going to Armstrongs for many years and can honestly say tonights meal was terrible. They are pricey but the food is usually good.  I spent 16.50 for six cheese raviolis that did not taste right  and 7.95 for 5 bland and undercooked zuchinnis.  The hoagies were good but I am disappointed with the quantity of the food.  I usually end up with bigger portions that justify the price.  If I end up with another meal like this I can say I won't be back! Why don't you have a website or an email address in this day and age??"}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal. Prices are reasonable. Quick service. Best for take out due to limited seating."}
{"text":"The first few times I ate here, I wasn't crazy about it. However, after trying different things and splitting meals with friends, I have found that this place has a meal for anyone. I always get it takeout and it is always ready when they say it will be, which is always less than a half hour. If you are eating there, there is little seating but it is still very quick and easy. I have enjoyed it many times over the years and I would urge others to as well."}
{"text":"What a great place for upscale takeout. After putting in a 12-hour day, AE is my saving grace. I've ordered here at least a half dozen times recently. The service is always super fast, reliable, and always friendly. The order is always right. They don't skimp on the bread(gotta be fresh mancini's), salad, or other side items.

The main courses are always delicious and plentiful. We've had the chicken parm, veal parm, chicken piccata, steak salad(real steak!), fettuccine Alfredo, and other items. They have all been superb tasting. The best part is having leftovers for lunch the next day!

While AE's might be more expensive than your average Italian takeout, there's simply no replacement for the real thing. They've got it going on there, and I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I got takeout from here for 2 reasons: 1. The reviews were fantastic, 2. It's literally a 2 minute walk from my hour so it's extremely convenient. I got a grilled chicken sandwich which was absolutely fantastic. As crazy as it sounds, the bread here is what really makes there sandwiches great. The chicken was cooked to perfection, and the fries were wonderful as well. I would definitely recommend this when your looking for a high quality, reasonably priced meal. My only problem is that they don't have a web site and that the menu posted on a few sites wasn't very legible. They gave me a menu and now I'll be a customer for life."}
{"text":"Had the Cajun wings and Italian calzone. The wings were good, but lacked more Cajun flavor and were a little greasy. The calzone was outstanding. Also their ranch is DA BOMB. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our family picks food up here more often than I would like to admit and feel fortunate to have a place like this close by. Also just about the nicest folks on staff greet us every week.....er.....I mean every time we come in."}
{"text":"This place is very good I can say I have never had bad food from here with several visits.  There is not really any were to sit unless you go in the summer they have a nice patio."}
{"text":"Awesome Armstrong's!  Been a regular customer for several years.  All take-out(there is a counter w stools inside & sitting there to eat is not a problem).  Excellent menu.  Convenient location.  Very pleasant staff ~ whether calling to order or ordering on site and waiting ~ they are experts at packing & wrapping to make it home intact and warm.  
The menu covers all the bases for a terrific Italian/American selection.
A pasta dinner is enough for my wife and I.  Sides are the usuals, but the wedding soup is dependably good and the Soup of the Day may be a delicacy ~ such as the Red Rocks Seafood Bisque or Vegetable!  
A Rueben should be shared, half-n-half with someone, unless you have 
a  pillow and blanket in the car and time for a \"happy-nap\" after consuming the whole sandwich.  Prices are spot-on for the serving sizes.  Parking can be sketchy is about the only issue ~ they and the neighboring businesses can be busy and just be careful in the parking lot ~ follow the arrows and use the meter machine.   A reliably Fine Italian restaurant that is designed for Take-Out tucked into the heart of Bridgeville.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Everything is amazing and not very expensive! Section to eat inside is not large they do a lot of takeout."}
{"text":"How did I not find this place earlier? If you are looking for take out in Bridgeville, Armstrong's is your place. As mentioned in previous reviews, Armstrong's is best for take out. They do have a couple tables at the front by the window but, I wouldn't count on them being open for you to sit and eat your meal. Another note is that your GPS will probably not take you directly to Armstrong's as it is in the back of the small plaza by the coffee shop. The entrance is in the parking lot, not directly on Washington Ave. 

I decided to order the fried zuchini appetizer and the penne vodka with chicken. The meal came with a soup or salad and I opted for the wedding soup. When I arrived, I was surprised by the cleanliness and efficency of this restaurant. There were several workers behind the counter working closely as a team to ensure that everyone got their orders in a timely manner. I know that I should not give extra credit for the food being ready at the time I was quoted or for actually receiving everything I ordered down to butter for the bread, but I feel that it is very rare to receive my complete order (condiments and all) in a timely manner when ordering take out from a restaurant. Armstrong's seems to have a smooth operation. In addition, I was pleasantly surprised by the portion sizes. The amount of pasta I received could easily serve two people. The zuchini was crispy and delicious. The pasta was also very good though if I have one criticism, it is that the vodka sauce was a bit creamy for my taste. I'm rather picky about my vodka sauces. All in all, I will definitely be going back to Armstrong's for take out . . . maybe even tonight."}
{"text":"Best takeout in Bridgeville!  Baked Ziti is the best and the Pasta Dishes all can feed two people.  The only downside is the parking"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Grilled chicken salad all the time!!!  Chicken Parm and Veal Parm are great sandwiches!!! Wings are huge too!!!"}
{"text":"Great place, food is always good and service with a smile everytime. Try this place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I always love stopping in for lunch at Armstrong's express. The reason I say lunch rather than dinner is not to say that it's not a good place for dinner too, it's just that there isn't much seating aside from the window bar and the outdoor patio. For lunch, it's totally fine, but for me personally, I like to sit somewhere a bit more \"comfortable\" for dinner.

As for food, though, Armstrong's is awesome. Their food is very good, especially considering the prices - which, in my opinion, I believe are very reasonable. Great salads, and very good sandwiches. I go here decently often and I've never had a bad meal. And the staff is always very pleasant - overall, you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Great place for some take out since there is not a lot of seating inside. Their Italian breadsticks are always fresh and delicious. They are golden brown pieces of dough sprinkled with parmesan and parsley that are perfect dipped in their marinara or ranch. 

Their grilled chicken salad is also huge and satisfying with fries, cheese, mushrooms, onions, olives, egg, and some garlic bread. Also, their ranch is probably my favorite ranch in Pittsburgh. I don't know why but their ranch is what other ranches should aspire to taste like. 

They are also great for catering parties and gatherings. We have used them for big trays of pasta and its always a hit. Everyone raves about their penne a la vodka and alfredo. The alfredo is super creamy and totally worth the gazillion calories."}
{"text":"Of course I love this place but I have to say it's probably a good thing I no longer live within walking distance because the pounds would be building. I did order out from here often. Probably once a month or so when I didn't want to cook. The portions are immense and the food is always above board for taste. Everything from the bread to pasta and meatballs are impeccable. Love the chicken parm. Be hungry when you order. Be very, very hungry!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time on Monday, as I had just finished spending over 3 hours at Dallas Beauty Lounge next door. I had been out of my house 14 hours that day and honestly forgot to eat lunch so by the time it was 7 PM I was starving. The staff at Armstrong's was so sweet to me and the food was delicious. As I was leaving the cashier asked if I wanted more bread because I had a long drive home. It was such a small act of kindness but it was such a nice gesture, as I was utterly exhausted that day. Now I really look forward to going back! It's so hard to find such wonderful customer service these days, but this place goes above and beyond."}
{"text":"Wow!  The food here is really amazing!  

The prices are NOT CHEAP, but the quality and the portion sizes are amazing!  I got the baked scrod and it came with a big, beautiful salad and a bowl of their really great wedding soup, and lots of Italian bread - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Everything was truly delicious, and I took a full meal home with me because of the big portions."}
{"text":"Really anyone who likes this place is totally confused! Ordered out for a family of 5 calzone was less than par and soggy, turkey sub was warm with lettuce and tomato... really you warm a turkey sub... why? Same goes for the beef... and the MOST bland subs! Ordered chicken nuggets that my son said tased like dust... I tried them and immediately tossed them. DISGUSTING! LAST BUT NOT LEAST... spinach salad... also awful, wilted and warm! Please don't waste your time on this place! I always heard great things but a HUGE disappointment!!!!"}
