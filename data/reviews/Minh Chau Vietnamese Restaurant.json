{"text":"I have to say that I NEVER write reviews especially if they are negative but this place left me extremely disappointed and enraged.  I was very excited for the new owners and surprised to find the food was pretty good so I kept running and getting their sate beef soup for lunch. However on my last visit I paid with cash and noticed the lady helping me giving me less change. I pointed it out and she shrugged it off saying she thought she gave it to me. It made me wondering if that has been happening before but I just never noticed. Last week I had someone visit me and they decided to pick up lunch and ended up at the restaurant. The food they ordered came to $38 but at the end bill they were looking for $48 saying that $10 is taxes.. Last time I checked we only have one and it's not 25% ?!  I can not believe these people are in business and that's the way they treat their customers. I'm not sure if this is the owner or just the wait staff trying to get a bigger tip but this is absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Excellent food, quick serve time. I really enjoyed it. Would suggest it. The price is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"I would describe this as an interesting little place in Inglewood.  The decor is plain (but not bad), the food was good, and the service was friendly enough.   There certainly were some funny little things that happened to lighten up our dining experience.  The server was nice, but also direct - no standing around to listen to anything special about our orders or when my friend asked for extra sauce.  When ordering 2 waters (I had to get up and go to the counter), only 1 was brought so we had to ask again when she came around to collect our bowls.  Also, the bill came all together (which was fine), but there was no breakdown in the prices for each meal, so we were left to guessing/remembering what our individual meals and drinks costed.  Oh yes, and the server started to vacuum while a few tables were there eating.  That made me laugh for sure.    It's a nice quaint little place and I would eat there again.  Good prices and quirky atmosphere, it's all good to me."}
{"text":"I wish I had the same experience here as Starsia, but I wasn't as lucky today I'm afraid.  Inglewood's rich with historically protected buildings... most places I've been to in this area have been renovated or at least well kept. This place... not so much - it smells and the carpets look as though they haven't been changed since the 70's.  All that stuff is secondary to the food of course, but they failed in that department.  I use to work around this area and definitely wondered what how this place was... I mean, was it just another local dive? or could it be a hole in the wall that I've been missing out on all these years?!  Unfortunately Pholks, it wasn't the latter. On the bright side, I wasn't super disappointed because 1) I wasn't expecting much in the first place 2) my curiosity is now satisfied but killed this cat and 3) I was treated to lunch at this restaurant by one of my close friends. Although, they had never been to this place before either so it was just one of those lunches that will never be brought up in conversation again hahaha.  Oh and BTW, it took 45 minutes for them to serve us our order... partly because they ran out of steamed rice... but I think they were kidding cuz who runs out of rice at an asian restaurant right? :P  So, it is with great displeasure I have to write a sad and disappointing review such as it is, but its the real deal kids.  I still love Vietnamese food and always will. If you're down for some pho anytime, lemme know! except I will say no if you suggest this place haha :)  PEACE"}
{"text":"We waited for an hour for our food, 40 mins for our drinks. Service was beyond slow and the food was mediocre. Save your money on someplace else."}
{"text":"The quality and taste at Minh chau have vastly improved since my first review. Now it is our go to Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"It's not bad but not the best either. It'll do in a pinch as there aren't any other Vietnamese places in Inglewood. Charboiled pork overcooked, so it was tough and dry. It wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant many times and so far it has the best pho I have had in Calgary. Most of the soups are quite good, the vermicelli dishes are decent and the chinese food is quite goodd as well (try the salted black pepper pork).  The restaurant  itself is quite old but everything is very clean. There is also lots of free parking available in a side lot; something you rarely see in Inglewood."}
{"text":"Great place for Pho.  Love the lemon grass chicken over rice verm.  Kind staff and wonderful staff!!  Love this neighborhood staple!"}
{"text":"Even if I don't order for months they remember me and what I like just by my voice if it's for pickup. I love their avocado shakes and if I forget to order one she reminds me because she knows how upset I'd be if I didn't get one. The quality of the food you get for the price you pay seems almost unfair to them. Even a small soup is meal sized. I can't think of one item on the menu that they don't do well. When you eat in the restaurant even when it's busy your food comes out fast. If you have never tried a three bean shake or an avocado sake I highly suggest you leave preconceived notions behind and try them. I have never had pho that tasted better. They were even named best pho restaurant in Calgary a few years ago when all the popular pho places were compared in the newspaper. You can't beat this quality, price and service."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite mid-week and ordered the shrimp appetizer to go on my way to an after-work meetup. Maybe they were having an off night; the counter staff was surly, and the portion was smaller than I expected. Every impression counts, and so I'm not inclined to go back."}
{"text":"Team Fam came here and I got a good taste of the following:  Pho Tai Gan (Vietnamese noodles with beef slices and tendon) Cha Gio (spring rolls) BBQ Pork and Rice  The beef in the pho comes well done here like most Calgary pho restaurants.The slices were chewy but lacked much flavour unless I doused them with hoisin sauce. The tendon fared a little better in flavour and the quantity was good for both toppings. Compared to the simple Pork and Rice dish though, I don't think the broth was good enough to warrant only having pho here.  The Cha Gio here are made with the unexciting kind of skin and not the rice paper skin. As such, they are quite hard and do not have the chewy crunch you get from more premium spring rolls.  The Pork and Rice were my favourite dish from this meal. The BBQ marinade is nice and gives the meat a subtle sweet taste that mixes well with the rice. If I went back I'd probably order another rice or vermicelli dish and skip any pho or spring roll cravings."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Minh Chau is in the Inglewood area of Calgary, which IMO is the community that closely resembles Winnipeg's Osborne Village. From what I know it's the only pho restaurant in the area, so if you're in the area this is probably your only choice.  Interior decoration isn't really much, which is expected for places like this. The menu is quite extensive, although I found the prices a bit higher than what I'm used to.  I had the beef stew rice noodle soup, which has lately become my go to for pho places. It was decent, though not the best I've had (especially given the price). It certainly wasn't as flavourful as the other beef stew noodle soups that I'm used to, although this could contribute to the lower MSG amounts that I felt at the end (didn't drink that much water during my time here).  Service was very good, and the place was quite busy at 1:30pm, so the business case was definitely there. However I would probably look somewhere else for Pho in Calgary next time."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. I've only tried a few dishes and both were pretty good. Drinks are overpriced (as is the norm for Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary these days.) I was pleasantly surprised that they have rice crepes with Vietnamese ham. The crêpes were a little doughy and overcooked for my liking but still tasty nonetheless. Since there aren't many great places for Vietnamese anymore this is probably one of the go to places for inner city. At least parking is plentiful and food is acceptable."}
{"text":"Last Thursday of the month means Garden Variety Show at Loose Moose Theatre! Have to grab a bite nearby, stop for noodle soup.  salad rolls and pho tai. Flavourful clear broth, speedy service, fresh sprouts and basil. Not the best pho in town, but definitely the right bowl at the right time.  Only complaint was that my soup could have been hotter.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Minh Chai's is great for a quick Vietnamese lunch. I like number 59 saté beef on vermicelli or 50 lemongrass chicken with spring rolls on vermicelli.  The price is decent, there's lots of meat, and the environment is bright and clean."}
{"text":"Are you Pho real? Ohh, bad pun. Awful way to start a review, but I went there anyways.  I stopped by this weird little place last night after absolutely crushing myself in the gym. I feel it's important that the reader understands that I was feeling extremely manly and also very hungry.   The guy at the front door was incredibly attentive and got us seated right away. I ordered what I normally get when I go for Vietnamese: Vermicelli noodles with spring rolls, shredded pork, char grilled pork and char grilled shrimps.  I was feeling a little tense, so I picked up a Tiger beer as well.  Decor was ... well, confusing. It looks kind of like an upscale truck stop in there. Maybe that doesn't do it justice, but it WAS clean. So.. there's that. Don't go here if you're an atmosphere glutton.  Now, I don't think our server was Vietnamese. In fact I have no idea what he was. He was just large, and friendly and very good at his job. Well done, man of mysterious ethnicity - well done.  When my meal came it was large, hot and full of delicious meats - just he way I like it. I immediately doused it in fish sauce, hot sauce and whatever that brown sauce is (as I normally do).   And then, dear reader, I ATE IT. I ate the whole thing. I ate it with chopsticks like a champion. I shoveled that vermicelli in my mouth like it was the last bowl on God's green earth. Had one of the ladies I was with tried to steal a spring roll I would have probably gnawed her fingers off - that's how famished I was.  And by the end, I was full. I was pleased. Joy coursed through my veins.  So, on the whole this is pretty standard Vietnamese. There wasn't anything special about it, though like another writer pointed out their meat is really well done. I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for some Viet in Inglewood."}
{"text":"Our rice vermicelli noodles with beef and lemongrass chicken and spring rolls were absolutely delicious.  The beef was tender and the lemongrass chicken had a fabulous lemongrass taste.  Sometimes I find it is too mild, but this one was noticeably lemongrass-y.  Delicious."}
{"text":"STEPH JUDGEMENT: Decent Vietnamese eats in a pleasant, casual setting.  The bf and I found ourselves in this part of town on a drizzly day and the prospect of a hot bowl of pho sounded too good to resist. We'd been surprised by the overall number of Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary, but there weren't that many to be had in this particular area, known as Inglewood (way cooler than the Inglewood in LA, btw). It's not fancy, but it was pretty spacious and clean, and had a nice variety of items on their menu. I got the seafood noodle soup and the bf got the vegetarian pho--they do have a good variety of vegetarian items, we'd noticed. I'd requested egg noodles with mine--twice--but got rice noodles instead -_- I didn't want to have to wait around so I just ate it with the rice noodles; it was fine. The spring rolls tasted a little greasy, but for the most part it hit the spot. The service was also pretty good; I'd say for the area it'd be my go-to place for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Everything was over cooked and cold. :( grilled shrimp were petrified and cold - telling me they were precooked and then rewarmed. The charboiled pork was so over cooked it was like jerky. Noodles - over cooked. The bottom of the bowl was loaded with bean sprouts so the dish looked larger than it actually was. Lettuce - limp.  Not a happy diner at all and won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Generous portions, good food. Very basic atmosphere and although the service is not unfriendly, you will probably have to go find someone if you want anything else after your order is delivered to the table as they will not return to check on you. Despite this, the prices are low and the food is definitely delicious and of good quality."}
{"text":"Was in the area for a wedding and needed some lunch after the ceremony.  It has pretty decent food.  I got a vermicelli bowl with grilled pork, spring roll and grilled shrimp.  Portions size was good, decent flavours and the restaurant was Clean.    I was with a friend who had a toddler.  She needed her diaper changed and they don't have a change table in the bathroom.... She had to change her daughter on two seats.... But honestly... They just need to invest in a wall mount change table for their customers."}
{"text":"We took a chance on a magazine review and tried out Minh Chau Vietnamese Restaurant in #Inglewood #yyc for the first time last week. It turned out to be a great discovery.   The menu had over a hundred items to choose from so there was no shortage of dishes to try. It was not a long wait to be served our dishes. All the food we tried was wonderful and it was loaded with more flavour than we have experienced in similar dishes recently at several other Vietnamese restaurants around Calgary. We both said to each other that It tasted like very high quality ingredients - no skimping. And the presentation was well-done.   The restaurant is located right on 9th avenue in #Inglewood so it was easy to find and the restaurant-only parking was great. The interior was clean and very well kept. The staff were very friendly and helpful at every moment.   It was an all-around nice dinner experience and we will definitely return with our friends (maybe some clients too).   Thanks Minh Chau,  ~ Shane"}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Went at lunch. Staff was friendly and food was quick.  If your going for lunch go early as it fills up quick!   We had the Pho and Deep friend won tons."}
{"text":"I arrived on a sunny Sunday with a large group and a hankering for a bun bowl of soup.  We were quickly greeted, seated and given tea!  That is always a good sign. I ordered the lemon grass and spring roll vermicelli soup.  It was fast to come and supper fresh!  So don't just walk by next time you are walking down 9th in Inglewood-go in for a yummy meal"}
{"text":"I get the tofu sub here. I pass a dozen or so sub shops on the way to Minh. I love that the buns are soft and fresh, flavours are spot on, and all the other vietminese tofu subs I try just don't compare. I haven't tried anything else here and don't plan to - it's the subs!!!"}
{"text":"pretty delicious! I had the veggies & tofu on rice, and it was great. Amelia got lemongrass chicken & springroll vermicelli - she said it was amazing. what I wish most for this place would be a cozier atmosphere, but whatever. service & food wise it's perfect, though!"}
