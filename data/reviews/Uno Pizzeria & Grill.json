{"text":"Went to Uno for lunch on a work day.  I have been there for happy hour but not for lunch.  Sit down and place our order and all seems good.  I get some soup, pretty good, and then they bring my wife's salad.  Good also.  Then they bring her half sandwich.  My ordered pizza of the day is nowhere to be seen.  10 minutes, nothing, 20 minutes nothing...some vague explanation that the kitchen is busy as everyone is ordering pizza.  Look around, no one seems to have pizza.  30 minutes go by, still no pizza and I need to get back to work.  Then told there was a large takeout order and my mini pizza somehow could not be made.  Asked for the bill and was given a to go pizza 35 minutes after ordering.  Thought I had found a nice lunch spot, now no lunch or happy hour business in the future..  Pizza tasted fine.  Some communication could have fixed this, but no one seemed to care."}
{"text":"The food was great. Deep dish pizza is my favorite and I was so happy to find that they served it! However, our waiter was horrible. He never took our dirty appetizer plates away when our meal came, he never offered us refills on our drinks...We had to ask for everything ourselves... I would hesitate going here again just solely based on service. And the structure of the building is awkward. We were seated upstairs and it was this little crowded compacted room. The table next to us was less than an arms length away so it was really uncomfortable trying to get out of our seats."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch and had the Roasted Eggplant, Spinach & Feta Flat Bread Pizza and a Mango Lemonade both choices were delivered quickly and were very good. I would definitely ordered these items again. Service was very good."}
{"text":"This is not homemade food.  This is a chain restaurant.  That being said, it's a good one.  I really like their pizza.  Maybe its something they put in the crust but they keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"It is sad to know that I live less than two hours away from Chicago, yet there are no local deep dish pizza places around.  To get my thick crust, cheese and sausage fix, I go to Uno's.  I never leave disappointed and always leave full. I like going there when my boyfriend and I can't really decide where to go for dinner because, frankly, you can ALWAYS eat pizza. :-D"}
{"text":"It's OK. We were staying in the hotel nearby and the roads were terrible, so we walked over. Some interesting local craft beers on tap, but not a single pale ale; three stars there. Interesting pizza choices on the menu, and other choices for people who wanted something different. The pizza was good--not great, but better than your average delivery pizza. I like their crust, the toppings tasted fresh, and sauce had flavor--food 3 stars. Service also three stars--friendly & prompt.  For a chain restaurant, Uno's is better than most, though would much prefer a locally owned pizzeria. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FYI From Mens Health (should you care about such things):  Uno Chicago Grill Chicago Classic Deep Dish Pizza  2,310 calories  162 g fat  123 g carbs  4,470 mg sodium  Downing this \"personal\" pizza is equivalent to eating 18 slices of Domino's Crunchy Thin Crust cheese pizza. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Of course it tastes 18 time better, so there is a trade-off..."}
{"text":"My wife and and I just flew in from D.C.  Just had a great meal at UNO. Food and service was fantastic. I was skeptical of the service based on some of the comments I read on Yelp however, could have not had a better experience. We were seated very fast. The waitress, Annie, was prompt, sweet and welcoming.  She swung by table through out the meal just to make sure we were doing well. Not intrusive at all. Even the manager came by to ask how we were doing. Very pleased and UNO did not disappoint.   Loved the deep dish Chicago Classic. And the \"Not so Mini-Chocolate Peanut butter cup\" was a perfect sweet finisher."}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunch! Such a large variety on the menu, it will surely meet anyone's needs!"}
{"text":"Well, it started well. Food was okay. Deep dish pizza was good. But the salad we had - too tiny portion!!! We were greeted and seated well. But later the service was not all good. Bad bad service. First of all we had to ask for everything we wanted. The server didn't even had courtesy to ask if we wanted anything more or would like to go for deserts. She just handed over the check when we even didn't ask for it (we wanted to order more). Later when we talked about this in the front, the girl there also just listened and said \"okay\", not even a sorry once!!! I would not like to go there again... :("}
{"text":"Good, clean pizza/bar place.  Numero Uno pizza is the way to go and they have a decent amount of beers on tap.  Wait staff is nice and friendly.    This is a chain, so you know exactly what to expect every time.  Good consistency."}
{"text":"I am a former fan of this establishment. Not so any more. First off, the lady with pink hair standing at the counter in what looked like the reception station ignored us for several minutes. When my wife asked her if we could be seated she rudely replied that we'd have to wait for her coworker. The hostess finally did show up but she was seemingly new and overwhelmed. The gal with the pink hair did not help her at all and directed rude comments at her coworker that only increased everybody's stress levels. Finally, when they called our name after twenty minutes of waiting (during which we counted eight open tables) they comically ignored us when we answered their call. Others waiting came to our defense and told them we were answering and standing right behind the hostess. Then we were seated at a small table next to the front door and hostess station. The family seated right next to us were seated at three two person tables that were shoved together but made an unlevel larger table that way. After ten minutes of being seated in the draft of the doorway and not having been given one bit more of attention - we left.  I am disappointed to say the least. Too many other fine restaurants in Madison to give this one another try."}
{"text":"We got a cold pizza!  We told our waiter who wasn't very personable and he said okay I'll take it back and reheat it. When he brought it back to us the edges were piping hot but the center was still lukewarm . So if you want lukewarm microwaved pizza then this is your place. They had maybe 15 other people in there besides us so they were not busy at all."}
{"text":"The menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive. For 2 personal pizzas (the size of pizza hut) 2 beers and 2 salads, we paid over $50 bucks. The personal pizzas alone were $11 each... If you want pizza and beer go somewhere else-pasta appetizers, or sandwiches... this place is good."}
{"text":"Horrible. I went there once and had a horrible waitress. I ordered a small deep dish pizza and it was dripping in grease. The only thing good about my experience was the beer I had, but you can't really mess that up. I don't suggest going to this place at all."}
{"text":"Food was delicious--try the pizza and steak and mini desserts! Fries were extremely salty. Stars off because tables were dirty, wait was long to receive food and waters were not refilled. 3.5 stars because they comped our desserts due to wait."}
{"text":"I had the spinoccoli deep dish pizza and i loved it! It was very delicious but the only thing keeping me from 5 stars was that I understand that It was small and the pizza wasn't as filled as I would like it to be for the price. I also had the chi town appetizer platter and it was not bad. I could tell that the chicken tenders were made from scratch and the avocado egg rolls were pretty good! My meal overall was very filling and I'm extremely happy with my meal and service overall."}
{"text":"Worst experience please don't go this shitty place Long wait for order delivery .for fucking sandwich they took 1 hour, the bartender is very careless and replied to me \"i am not making it \". Damn worst service in my entire life. Manager is also worst and racial."}
{"text":"Went for the Pizza Day promo, small free pepperoni pizza. First they said we could sit at the bar for the promo. Then they said we couldn't but could sit at a booth in the bar. We also ordered nachos, a mistake. Nachos had chili which was sweet, peppers had a kick, other ingredients were unremarkable and chips got soggy quickly. There was live music in the bar. All in all, nothing special. Slow bar service but there was only 1 bartender covering all drink orders, she was a bit in the weeds."}
{"text":"They're really trying hard to improve. Wild mushroom Flat bread was best flat bread I've had in a long time. 2 choices of flat bread, we chose 9 grain. Salad was Ok. They made a great effort to making sure my order was completely accurate. Appreciated it. Keep it up"}
{"text":"Ordinarily I wouldn't go here, but since it was walking distance from my hotel and I had no desire to drive on the snowy roads, chain food became acceptable fare.   I want to know why this place has Cajun blackened mahi-mahi on the menu when they don't cook it with an ounce of Cajun seasoning?  I got a plain grilled fish.  The cauliflower and cheese side was nearly indistinguishable from the mashed potatoes.  Only small chunks of cauliflower which probably had all the nutrients cooked out of them signaled which dish I was eating."}
{"text":"My family and I frequently eat here and it's my aunt's favorite restaurant!! I love the atmosphere and how it has tons of decorations on the walls reflecting Chicago. The pizza is delicious, especially the Deep dish pizza, and I particularly love the veggie pizza which has a diverse variety of veggie toppings on it. I love the dinner salads as well,  especially the strawberry walnut salad and the honey chicken salad. The beer is very good as well.  This fine establishment in the Waterfront will continue to be a favorite haunt of my family and i for years and decades to come."}
{"text":"I've come here on many occasions, my food is usually great! It can be greasy but usually still very tasty. I was very disappointed today however. We got the Shroom pizza. They didn't even use fresh mushrooms, obviously canned....c'mon Unos, GET IT TOGETHER!"}
{"text":"Bland, not at all Chicago Pizza.."}
{"text":"Was there the other night with my family for dinner. Had one of the best waitresses I've encountered. Kristi H. knows customer service. I have 3 little kids, she engaged with all of them. Her personality was terrific. Everything and anything we asked for she was on the spot with. Another guest was being seated near us, and she in passing welcomed the guest and acknowledged she would be right with them. A very nice gesture of the 10ft rule. Most wait staff at high end restaurants would do that.   If the rest of your staff is like Kristi H. you have one he'll Uva great staff. Thanks for the great customer service"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative  stareview I would, but I'm forced to give one star I guess.  We were told our pizza would be here in 30 to 40 minutes. After one hour I called, and was told they were very busy, and my delivery driver was on the way. After an additional half hour I called again and was told that there was a mix up and in fact my order had never been made.  So they lied to me to get me off the phone the first time, and never actually made the food.  Thank you so much for allowing me to eat crappy frozen burritos from the hotel freezer. What a great night Uno you've done it again!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. My friends had the deep dish pizza and said it was not as thick and delicious as the one they had at Uno's in Chicago. The salad they ordered was mediocre, nothing special. I had the 5 grain thin pizza with eggplant spinach and tomato, which was okay. The most memorable part of the meal was observing our waiter who kept a dead-pan expression and lumbered slowly back and forth from the dining room to the kitchen. He only provided silverware for the salad eaters, not for those with pizza who might like to eat ingredients that fell off the pizza onto the plate. Shouldn't have to wait and request eating utensils. We all agreed we would not return."}
{"text":"The best pizza crust hands down! We rarely get to eat here but it's always good! Friendly waitstaff and really good food."}
{"text":"Can't complain, Uno's pizza crust is to die for. Love it!  I hadn't been to Uno's in years, but I took my mother there because I had received an email from them with a take out deal - buy one pizza, get a second pizza for $5 (takeout only). We went on a Sunday around 3pm and wasn't greeted when we entered. Decided to sit at the bar and have a drink while we waited for the pizza to cook. The bartender knew of the deal and assured us we could order ANY two pizzas. We ordered two medium size pizzas and enjoyed our drinks. Got our to go pizzas and our bill. $40!!!! ??? We asked for an itemized receipt and noticed that we were charged for a large pizza. When we inquired, the bartender told us that the deal was only for large sizes. Not what he told us before and not what we ordered.  Also, \"large\" pizzas are small in diameter. Thankfully the thick (and delicious) crust sorta made up for it. But two drinks and two pizzas with a deal was not worth the price."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with the food. It was overcooked and not seasoned very well"}
{"text":"I was contacted a few days after I wrote my review by UNOs and was asked to email them all the details of my visit which I did. I than relieved another email apologizing to me about the visit and asking me to call them. I must have tired at least ten times to call them!!!!!!! It left my frustrated and upset that every time I called no matter the time I was given a answering machine recording. I eventually just gave up trying to call them. I will give them credit for reaching out but I'm really disappointed I could not see it through"}
{"text":"This was my first experience here. Crab and shrimp dip appetizer was good. My wife and I ordered a deep dish pizza with spinach, feta cheese, pepperoni, onions, banana peppers, and garlic. They forgot the banana peppers and the garlic. We also had a few Long Island iced teas. We sat near the bar. The bartender/waitress wasn't really very good. The food and atmosphere was awesome. I would've rated it better except for the bartender/waitress. We went there around 2:45pm. So it wasn't like it was too busy either."}
{"text":"Do not eat outside. The service is miserable. The food was cold including the amazing ability to have cold melted cheese. Pizza cold. In short miserable dining experience. The host was irritated that we wanted to sit there in the first place. He was a guy with black curly hair that does not care."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Fast and friendly service. Nice options of combos like salad and soup. Soup and burger. Soup and pizza. I am fan of the soups here. They are really fresh and i can try more than onesoup in all you can eat soup. Great value for the price you pay. I have to try to for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Food bland and service spotty in the bar area. Table wasn't cleaned well and some condiments missing. Spinach and artichoke dip not creamy and full as you would expect - more runny. Burger was not seasoned and the garlic mayo was thinly applied and hardly \"garlicy\"."}
{"text":"We went with a coupon around 4pm on a Sunday so it was rather empty. It's a family-friendly restaurant but don't go for the food; go for the atmosphere or the evening deals.  My BF ordered the whole hog burger which was PACKED with toppings (and it's price reflected that). It was greasy. Unremarkable. He ate only half which is rare for him. It did come with sweet potato fries and delicious onion rings.  I ordered the nine grain Farmers Market individual deep dish pizza. It was dry which detracted significantly from a good flavor. I've been to the other UNO pizzeria in the area and I loved my pizza but I had a normal crust so maybe that was a factor.   Overall, service was good. Food okay."}
{"text":"I had the deep dish pizza and it was very good!  The individual size was smaller Than I expected for $12 but I wasn't starving so it was very filling.  Our waitress April was very nice and attentive for how busy it was.  We had about a 30 minute wait but it was worth it!  I can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"solid food....very good service and kid friendly....a sure spot in the dells rotation."}
{"text":"Overall it was a good experience at Uno. This was my first visit and I could see myself going again. I ordered a pomegranate Margarita and a flatbread. Our group contained about 20 people so our server had a lot of running around to do. I was the last person to receive my drink about 10 minutes behind everyone else. I just chalked that up to our group being so large. The margarita was okay, it wasn't worth the money in my opinion. The food came out in a timely manner and my flatbread was made just right. Hot and crisp with a generous amount of toppings. I'd like to try other things on the menu. Everyone at our table seemed to enjoy what they got and no one had any complaints."}
{"text":"Stopped here after camping in the Dells. Such a good decision. Service was awesome and the FOOD!!!! Whoa.  It was Tuesday so the kids are free after we ordered the Windy City Thin crust. Just wow."}
{"text":"Got our seating right away, asked for a table, got a booth, strike one. Waitress was serving us and working behind the bar as well, we were secondary, strike two Appetizers took 20 minutes to arrive in a restaurant that was less than 40% full, strike three I ordered the \"whole hog burger\" with fries and onion rings, probably would have been a lot better if it was warm when it arrived. Probably ready for at least 5 minutes before it was brought to me, she was busy making drinks, strike four. After we were done eating it took 15 minutes to get the check, strike five. MESSAGE TO MANAGEMENT: GET EITHER A WAITRESS OR A BAR MAID. PEOPLE DOING DOUBLE DUTY DOES NOT CUT IT !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to actually like this place.. but its highly disappointing as well as insultive when the manager comes to your table (when you let your wait person know you are dissatisfied with your order) and he tries to CONVINCE you your order was made correctly and there's NO issues.. uhhh really!?? Total MISS ... I'll pass on the pizza.. thanks but NO thanks.. I'm NOT paying for what I wanted I'm now paying for YOUR mediocre!!"}
{"text":"I went with a small group because they were advertising a \"craft beer night\". Apparently, \"craft beer night\" means four easy-to-find local beers that are always on the menu... are on the menu. Except for one, which they were out of. This is mildly irritating, but not a disaster or anything. Just a forewarning to anyone else who might be drawn in by false advertising. The \"event\" also involved half-off appetizers and 50-cent wings, which were pretty good, according to the people in the group who ate them. The main problem was the service, which was really, really bad. Except for one young black guy (sorry, I didn't catch your name!), who was great, everyone we interacted with was some combination of clueless and rude. It was very slow, and the waiter didn't know what was on the menu or how the specials worked. This would have been fine if he'd been more assiduous about figuring it out and getting back to us, but he wasn't.  Everything went way downhill when we tried to pay and leave. We got the wrong check three times, with long stretches of time in between and the first two massively overcharging us for the food and drinks (more than $20 for 15 50-cent wings?). When we mentioned this to the waiter, he stared at us in confused silence, then tried to argue that the check was correct.  When we spoke to the manager, she was snippy and aggressive from the beginning of the interaction. The third iteration of the check was still incorrect, but we had been trying to get out of there for close to an hour, and none of us wanted to keep dealing with the manager. I'm usually a 30% tipper, but I left nothing."}
{"text":"So good! From Pizza to salmon, great food! Very accommodating to our large group and very good service!"}
{"text":"I grew up @ another UNO's and LOVE this place so much! I was here all the time and grew up loving all of their food.  When we discovered there was an UNO's here we were SOO excited!  The Pizza Skins app was great and the Pizza was great as well.  I do have to say we miss their old menu though (ie. Tuscany Bread, Four Cheese Pizza and Spinoccoli Pizza).  However everything was still delicious!!!  As for the service, it was not very good, and there was one other tab l taken in the place. We waited to be seated for 3-5 minutes, seeing no one till we walked around...  Then the app took 20 minutes to come out.  Ordered 10-15 min later and the pizza came out just after the app arrived.  For no other tables here at this point the wait was ridiculous. I'd give this review a 1-2 star if it were not for the amazing Deep Dish Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"How does this place still exist of every place on the waterfront!    I won't lie, I do like their Lobster Bisque but every time I've gone it's just over priced, average quality with semi ok service.  Skip this place all together and get pizza at Pizza Company and take it home."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  All menu items are good and service is always above par.  Good childrens menu."}
{"text":"I've had their pizza once at the restaurant and once in its frozen form purchased at a local grocery store.  I get the supreme and must say that it has a lot of flavor!  The veggies are actually able to be tasted unlike similar types of pizzas at other locations.  I don't remember what I paid at the restaurant, but for $10.50 in its frozen form, this is pizza I will continue to purchase.  Granted it's more expensive than a tombstone or Red Baron, but then again, it's WAY better and local."}
{"text":"The service at this location is slow, the prices are outrageous, the food is totally sub-par, the drinks are always made super duper weak, and they close really early. I don't suggest coming here for a good time. The servers are nice, but I would suggest going to a more delicious location."}
{"text":"It's basically the only Chicago style pizza in the Burgh. Not having had authentic Chicago style pizza, I don't know how this chain's pizza compares. However, the pizza is decent. The crust is thick and buttery and the toppings are abundant. However, don't be fooled, they serve up much more than pizza and sometimes, it's nice to have that variety when you're coming with a large party and when not everyone wants pizza.   I like the versatility here with the varied menu. Sometimes, I don't even come here for the pizza. While the pizza is definitely the star of the show, their steak is also pretty tasty as are the sandwiches.   The food is enjoyable but the main reason why this is a go-to for me and my friends is because the service is usually very quick here. There rarely is a wait and the wait staff get us in and out right in time to make it to a movie. With food being rather consistent, it's hard to go anywhere else and chance the long wait times."}
{"text":"The deep dish pizza here is absolutely scrumptious! So cheesy and saucey, the crust is almost pie-like. Even when they are absolutely slammed we never have to wait long for our food. This place quickly became a favorite."}
{"text":"Great pizza, but on the small side. Everyone needs at least half, and probably a whole, pizza to themselves. This makes them a bit pricey."}
{"text":"The only reason to come here is because it's a fun place to eat. It sure isn't the food.   Too much dressing in a salad that didn't even fill the bowl. Like so many before it, UNOs is making me leave hungry. It was a salad with Walnuts, Goat Cheese, and Blueberries, and while it was good, there was absolutely no value in this meal. One of these days I will learn to stop eating at big chain restaurants, kind of like not shopping at big box stores.   It's a nice atmosphere and generally crowded and loud. Some would call it fun and I think it is. But, sometimes it's worth a little extra to get what you really want and need in a meal. That's what adds value.   In the future these places will be relegated to the last ditch effort when nothing else is available. Only in a pinch."}
{"text":"I was staying in town to break up a drive back from visiting in laws and decided to stay at the hotel and order delivery instead of going out as we had originally planned. On the room key there was an advertisement for Uno, so we decided to give it try. I ordered what appealed to each person in my party. When finalizing payment I was asked how many sets of silverware I needed, I indicated 3. Apparently there was some confusion about what was listed on the menu they placed in the hotel vs what was actually available (ordered fish and chips but got a call back that indicated it was not actually on the menu anymore). We were able to select another item without issue. Upon a timely arrival I took care of the credit card part and started to up pack everything.  The BBQ sampler was not sent complete and no cutlery or a single napkin. Pretty disappointing considering we just got out of the car from being on the road all day. Fortunately I was able to call and speak to a manager so they would have an opportunity to use this as a training moment. I can't say that this experience will prevent me from visiting one of these restaurants in person should I encounter one again, but will never try them for a delivery scenario in the future. Beside the error in preparation of the BBQ Sampler the food was what I expected for delivery. Hope this helps you decide what you want to do."}
{"text":"8/10/13 and 8/11/13 We stopped in to enjoy the bar.  They had Ale Asylum Hopalicious, Lake Louie Warped Speed Scotch Ale, and New Belgium Brewing Rampant Imperial IPA on draft along with several others.  Tasty craft beers found at a chain restaurant are rare from my experience.  We learned it was happy hour all day on Sunday for several food items.  Their chili nachos and Caesar salad were tasty.  We enjoyed their deep dish spinoccoli with sausage.  It's not on the menu, but they still make it.  They play a nice and varied mix of music and have several TV's for sports watching.  We plan on stopping in more frequently.  In the past this wasn't a personal favorite."}
{"text":"Not quite authentic but good enough for Pittsburgh. It's the only place that I've found that even comes close to a classic Chicago style deep dish. I also had the french onion soup that wasn't bad. The croutons were still crunchy and it had just the right amount of cheese.  My girlfriend really enjoyed her Caesar salad and said she'd come back just for the salad.  Overall, I enjoyed it and would come back the next time I get a craving for a deep dish pizza. It wasn't authentic but it certainly was not terrible."}
{"text":"If I could do one star, I would. We ordered a drink that wasn't good, asked to send it back, and the RUDE manager Ron Lamberty came to our table and told us we were unable to be unsatisfied with their product if we ordered it. He wouldn't allow us to cancel the rest of our meal because we ordered it. The appetizer including the quesadilla, chicken bites, and meatballs was abysmal. Caesar salad was over dressed and just bottom line I have NEVER been treated so horribly by a location manager EVER. He was aggressive and disrespectful and it was completely uncalled for. I will never be returning here and I suggest nobody gives their business to someone who treats their CUSTOMERS so poorly."}
{"text":"Poor management, plenty of empty tables, but line is still over an hour. Waitress had a negative attitude when we asked to have another minute to look at the menu & stormed off."}
{"text":"There are many choices for lunch including  salad with all you can eat soup.  The rest of the lunch specials are on the back of the menu.  Eventhough this is a chain, I wasn't sure that they'd cater to a fast lunch crowd."}
{"text":"It gets 5 stars cause it jogs up a memory. Back before Pizza Hut turned into a fast food restaurant, the Pizza Hut my grandfather used to take me to was a really nice restaurant. And this location has the same look and feel as the old pizza hut before it went take out.   So this is the old style pizza hut.   Very family orientated dining style. You can sit here for hours. And so we did. We had a heap of use in a long table.  I ordered one of the small pizzas which were buy 1 get one free. Disappointed in the selection of that. Seeing other choices... I regretted going on the cheap.   Prices are moderate. 12 for a little pizza... but with all the dough, you get full. Can't say I walked away hungary. Nor did I finish my second mini pizza.   I want to come back and get that spanich fetta looking pizza!"}
{"text":"Food was ok had a steak w/ shrimp side Ass mashed potatoes. Everything was ok not a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Fast to  get in. Food was tasty. Except the steak was a little well done. Salmon was amazing and the farro salad delicious. Friendly waitstaff and hosts.  We came with a coupon so it was more affordable,. We will be back."}
{"text":"If I could give it less stars I would!!! First of all we had my bother who had just run the IronMan! We sit down the waitress (Shay) was shy, when she finally brought our drinks she didn't set them on the table she handed them to us she didn't seem to know who had what, might be a little bit picky but true. Then we had a few questions about the menu and how many wings you get she didn't know and was guessing. We all ordered our food and my dad also ordered soup and asked for it to come out b4 the rest of our food. Considerable time had passed, the soup still didn't come so he got her attention, asked where the soup was and also ordered a second beer, the soup came out shortly after that, she handed it to him and he didn't take it from her so she awkwardly put it down like she wasn't sure what to do. We finished the soup and still haven't gotten the beer. Again my dad caught her attention as she was walking by and said where is the beer, the soup was done, at that time we ordered two more drinks and they all came out together a few minutes later. We finally get SOME of our food, we got 2 out of our 5 meals, finally 1 more came but didn't have any sides with it she asked did you want side with it, I said yes then I asked what were the sides she didn't really know any but fries! The sides never came so all I had was a small piece of chicken, we asked when the other pizza we ordered was coming about three times, for the man that did the iron man, she said let me check by this time we had all finished our meals and he was still waiting! She came back finally and said it never got made! She never offered him anything else to eat!! Then she said I will talk to the manager about taking the pizza off and possibly getting a discount. She came back and said the manager took off the pizza and my sides that never came and a discount. The manager never came to the table, she didn't really apologize at all she said was that the kitchen was busy! It wasn't busy when we got there! The table next to us got the wrong beer and took them our entire meal to get their appetizer!!! Not impressed nothing was handled right! There were also 6 tables around us and most of them were not cleared the whole time we were there!"}
{"text":"While visiting relatives in Somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town of Homestead.  My aunt insisted that we have lunch at Uno's Pizzeria & Grill as the food was delicious.  When we arrived I had to admit that I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the place.  It was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease.  I settled on a Turkey, Bacon and Avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times.  They have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages.  The food arrived in no time and was DELICIOUS!  The portions were just right for lunch, I was definitely ready for an afternoon of shopping.  The four of us had items off the Two for U lunch menu, our bill was less than $30 which meant that I might could afford the shoes I wanted to buy!  My aunt was right, you cannot visit Homestead without stopping to eat at Uno Pizzeria & Grill, it is FANTASTIC!!"}
{"text":"From the hostess to the server to the food - just poor. Must be poor management to allow such a sad experience of dinner. Nobody cares about anything, don't waste your time. Others Unos were great but this one was anything but great."}
{"text":"I can not explain how amazing the food is here, the topping to actual pizza ratio is perfect!! From the pizza sauce to the crust of the pizza and not to mention the toppings all taste so good. The deep dish pizza especially is phenomenal, I would highly recommend Uno's for a nice place to get some greatly made pizza!"}
{"text":"Visited recently for a work lunch.  Everyone was impressed with their food selections.  Pizza and salads were really good.  Fairly standard pizza but it was very good.  Service was ok but nothing too special."}
{"text":"Very good service and great pizza! The staff did a great job with refills and making the 4 kids in our group comfortable. The bloody Mary bar looked great."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Wasn't impressed. I had the cheddar and mushroom burger. Didn't care for it at all. Ended up eating the top bun and throwing the rest away. Wife had the Cajun pasta and said it was ok. Probably will try somewhere else next time in Madison"}
{"text":"Great service and good quality food for a decent price. Went for lunch and had soup/salad. You get a bottomless bowl of soup and can switch kinds. Fast lunch for the working person during the week."}
{"text":"I had an Italian Wedding Soup (the soup of the day) and one of their artisan pizzas with Prosciutto. The soup was pretty okay. The pizza was great. The crust's texture was lovely, a slight chewiness on the inside and a delicate crispiness on the outside (though sadly this quality did not survive refrigeration). The flavor was interesting and worked. The server was fairly prompt and the food came pretty quickly, too. A solid place to eat."}
{"text":"I do like this place.  The pizza is really good, and is significantly different from most, if not all, of the other pizza I have had in Pittsburgh.  DISCLAIMER:  This is NOT full-on, proper, Chicago-deep-dish pizza.  I have been to the original in Chicago, as well as to Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, and Giordano's, many times, over the years.  If you want real Chicago pie, you will be disappointed with Uno's \"deep dish\" product.  That said, it's still really good in its own right.  It is pricey, but it is pretty thick and will fill you up, so you will not eat as much as you think (so is it really expensive?).  Service is pretty good, the restaurant is large and accommodates big families and groups well.  The side-salads are fresh and good.  They have lots of easy parking.  So overall, it's good, and fit's Yelp's description of 3-stars:  \"A-OK.\""}
{"text":"Since writing my review, we have had UNO successfully deliver to our apartment three times, so perhaps the glitch in the system is fixed!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place has a huge menu and some healthy options... That's the good. Try to order the 9 grain crust and you'll see the bad... I've had servers forget it, Ive had servers blame the kitchen, \"oh, so-and-so's working, they always forget the special crust.\"  Every time... There's a problem. Every time. And it's not like I go on the weekends when it's super busy. Usually a late weekday lunch around 2 PM. Today, the server brought me the pizza and announced it as \"tomato and cheese with the nine grain crust.\" I took a few bites and noticed it was probably not the nine grain crust. So when she came to check on me, I asked her if it was, and she looked at it and said she wasn't sure. She went back into the kitchen and came out with an unbaked nine grain crust to show me because the cook had said that whoever made the crusts didn't make them correctly.  So that's all they had to work with that day. Ridiculous!  And the pay at the table kiosk: why am I doing your job for you? Their loyalty cards don't work at the kiosks.  Half the time, gift cards don't work at the kiosks... So why would the server even offer it?  The Manager did come over and apologize for the crust, but by that point I was so irritated because the server had to take my credit card and the loyalty card because the kiosk didn't work and I was ready to leave."}
{"text":"I recently had to visit Pizzeria Uno for a group meet up right after lunch time on a Monday. Aside from our group, the place was virtually empty. They sat us in what I can only assume is the room they have set aside for groups and it was FREEZING! Despite asking for the heat to be turned up it never got warmer. The person I was accompanying was on a budget of $20 for lunch. He ordered a cranberry juice and a gluten free pizza. Despite NOT asking for another juice he was brought...and charged...for a second glass. I myself ordered the personal pan pizza and a soda. I am still finding it hard to believe that the SMALL pizza and soda came to almost $20 and his was almost the same. The service was terrible. I really don't like to leave negative reviews but between the value of the meal for what it really was and the service I'm fairly certain that unless work makes me have to go back I won't return on my own. We could have filled the car up and gone to Chicago to buy a deep dish pizza and made it back for the same amount we paid that day."}
{"text":"In college there was an UNO Pizzeria not far from campus. I have fond memories of amazing pizzas and the famed chocolate chip cookie in a deep dish pan. UNO was the best, especially since Old Chicago put too much whipped cream in places it didn't need to be.   However, if this is the state of UNO, I can see why it has closed in multiple cities. The spinach artichoke dip was mediocre at best. The signature UNO pizza was lacking in toppings and size. AND the signature birthday cookie is no longer! Now, the birthday treat is one of their mini desserts and I could find a better brownie in the Hostess aisle at Target.  Besides the food, service was really great! They were attentive and friendly. If only the food hasn't had me wishing we had chosen Old Chicago instead."}
{"text":"We weren't really impressed. The service was fine, but the pizza wasn't very good. We got the Margharita and the basil was all wilty and dry. We probably won't go back even though we live within walking distance as there are better pizza places in town."}
{"text":"HATED IT.. RUDE and incompetent waitress. We walked out after 15 minutes. She spilled drinks and didn't apologize OR clean up the table. We had to ask for silverware upon getting our appertizer. She returned 5 minutes later and said..sorry you have to wait until they WRAP the silverware in the napkins! I said just bring us some FORKS. She ACTUALLY GRUNTED and said something under her breath. I slammed down the menus and said WE ARE OUTTA HERE! And made a HUGE scene as the hapless manager followed us out the door. BUH-BYE!"}
{"text":"Vicki is the greatest bartender ever at UNO's Madison East! Go see her. Great appetizers and wonderful variety of pizza. I love their pizza skins appetizer!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and am a big fan. Once boyfriend and I stopped in after shopping to have a beer, the other time we had drinks and the spinocclli pizza. Both times we sat in the bar area.  I have no complaints about this place. It's quick, the vibe is great (in the bar area), and the food is served hot and delicious. The staff is friendly and we enjoyed ourselves.  The only qualm I have is that the serving size isn't very large so you'd have to buy a few pizzas if out with more than two people.   A good place to come for dinner and drinks with friends or a casual date."}
{"text":"Awful everything. From the bad service, to the diluted soup, to the lame-no chicken on the chicken salad, to the PRE-fabricated pizza. AVOID THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Met my family here after work on a weekday. Not many people dining here at the time but our dinners seemed to take longer then they should have considering not very busy. As we were waiting on our pizza the waitress handed us a trivia game console to use. We played 2 games of trivia and the game of life. The pizza came and the crust was very dry and not much flavor to it. When we were presented with our check we noticed a charge of $1.99 that we didn't know what it was for.  When we asked what the charge was for they charged us for the games that we played on the console that they gave us while waiting for our dinner. I have never heard of anything like it. I wonder how many people used the games and were charged the fee and paid it without noticing it on the bill considering it was hidden discreetly in the middle of the bill. Then when we were ready to pay the bill with cash. We couldn't get our server to come and take payment. Was very disappointed. It will probably be awhile before I go back if ever."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and split a pizza and pasta with my girlfriend. We started with a garden salad which was brought to us with the wrong dressing. Then when we got our pizza they brought it to us on the wrong crust. Our pasta was below par as well. After being disappointed with those entrees we decided to order a pizza to go which we waited an extra twenty mins for, when it arrived it came on the wrong crust again so I said something to our waitress who instantly put the blame on the cooks when our receipt said original when we I specifically requested multigrain. My girlfriend then decided to talk to the manager about the poor service. When she came back our waitress Jenny came over she rudely apologized for the service and didn't take responsibility for her mistakes on our orders. We have been to UNOs many times and had  been highly satisfied  but this appalling visit  left us with negative feelings towards UNOs as a whole."}
{"text":"We have stopped at Uno's in the Waterfront, several times in the past. Dinner or lunch has always been a hit or miss.   Our last visit has been very good. I have always loved the potato skin pizza, the salad was very good with the homemade dressing. I however did not like the Italian Wedding Soup.   The service was very good. Helpful & friendly !!   I also have to say that management was wonderful in securing a lost item, that I called about the next day.   The new menu is great ! We will return !"}
{"text":"Last week was my first visit to this place. The raspberry tea was amazing. We got the app sampler,  it was very good except for the homemade guacamole. I ordered a side salad, hardly any dressing on it, and not very fresh. I ordered the stuffed chicken with broccoli & grilled vegetables.  Waited along time for the entrée.  The chicken was good but a small portion.  The broccoli & veggies were water logged. Lots of water on the plate. Tried my friends fried shrimp, it was good with good flavor. Might have just been who was in the kitchen that night so I would give it another shot."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the waterfront, visit this place. Their pizza is the best I've ever had in my life! They have a build your own pizza section in their menu, you can't go wrong. Their drinks are delicious and the prices fair for their quality and portions. The servers are nice as well."}
{"text":"I think the location in homestead has ruined this place. Dirty dirty dirty.  Bathrooms unkept, entry door handle and windows filthy  Pizza had too much sauce on it and was drenched. Server was coarse, not refined  Serving items were old and rusty. Temperature of food was not hot  Low quality, but probably ok with pittsburgher s"}
{"text":"Service here is quite good.  Zero complaints for service or atmosphere.  Everything seems to be in order for that.  Food quality though leaves a lot to be desired food was somewhat cold and not very well prepared.  Seems more like food you find in a diner in the middle of nowhere i.e. \"The Greasy Spoon\".  Certainly not on par with other Pizzeria UNOs I have been to like in Orlando. Giving it 2 stars as nothing is actually wrong with the restaurant just the food is really horrible."}
{"text":"I am a straight up sucker for Uno's Spinoccoli frozen pizza at from Woodman's. Yeah, that's right. FROZEN PIZZA. My husband cooks it to perfection at home. Loved it since he introduced it to me 3 years ago. So why not go to Uno's for real?  I tried my hardest not to order anything spinoccoli related. The menu was extensive enough with some pretty good choices. Even so, my husband ordered the chicken spinoccoli pasta. The chicken breasts were stuffed with the vegetables and was surprisingly moist. He really enjoyed it.   Since it was Friday night, I had the fish fry--which was perch. It was reaaaallly delicious. The breading wasn't overkill so the fish was plentiful. I haven't had too much exposure to fish fry here in Madison, but it's my favorite so far.  Service was average. Nothing too special, but not terrible. Since it's closeby, it's likely we'll come here again to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my fiance and another couple on the way from Chicago to the dells for dinner. Place was pretty quiet for a Saturday evening which was surprising. Food was your typical UNO's experience, if you have never been to an Uno's try the deep dish pizza it is pretty good, Though like most Uno's the menu is huge but i always get the pizza, service was good,fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Unos has been around for ever, & I feel like this restaurant chain peak in popularity in the 80's. Honestly the decor inside still kind of looks 80s to me even though its nice with sleek booth and exposed brick.  If you haven't died and he recently I ordered you to come back and have a meal here again because honestly the food is really quite good!  They have the best chicken salad wrap ever! I love that rap so much I want agreed to walk the south side River Trail from where the Steelers practice all the way to the damn waterfront just because I knew that I could convince my boyfriend to go to Unos with me for lunch.  Full disclosure:  I made him call is a cab and we took a taxi back to the parking lot after lunch.  Listen... The food and pizza and service are very good, surprisingly so! I don't know why this place is not busier but next time you're down at the Waterfront please do consider dining here!"}
{"text":"Real shame.  Had not been here in a year or more. Sorry to say rumors of its demise are true.  Once had top flight staff and food.  All very average or worse now. Even signature deep dish not great anymore. Lots of signs place is becoming run down."}
{"text":"After some birthday shenanigans at Dave & Buster's, our (soon to be) birthday boy wanted to eat at Uno, so that's where we found ourselves.   When we walked in,  the hostess greeted us with a smile and a friendly \"hello\", asking us how many, getting a name and letting us know it would be about 10 minutes.   We were sat at a table within 10 minutes and our server,  Amy,  appeared within a minute with a smile, introducing herself, asking us how we were, and taking our drink orders. Our drinks (water, iced tea, and a lemonade) were brought back promptly and we ordered an appetizer.   As we studied the huge menu, we flipped back and forth through the pages & finally decided on two entrées each,  which would be narrowed down to one each as Amy answered our questions about each.  Immediately after we ordered our entrées, Amy came over with 'bad news'.... that they were out of the appetizer we had ordered.... No biggie to us,  as we understand! She brought over a menu so we could pick a different app & took the order promptly. They came out quickly and were delicious!  (Oh!  We ended up getting the Zucchini)   Our food came out in a timely manner. Amy brought us refills,  a ramekin of ranch, and a box (because looking at my meal,  I knew I was going to need it). We enjoyed every bite of our meals. Amy checked on us a couple of times, ensuring things were wonderful.   The prices for what we got were great. The food was fantastic. The service was wonderful! We will certainly go back next time we are at the Waterfront and we will ask for Amy's section, in hopes that she will be there!"}
{"text":"Very poor service in the bar. Tried to order a cocktail, and the bartender didn't seem to approve. What she lacks in knowledge, she makes up in churlishness. Didn't try the food. That would require having to stay longer."}
{"text":"I suppose if you like Uno's already you would think this was a great place. It was very clean, the service and the waitress SUPERB! The pizza - meh, I've had much better. Its just a personal taste thing. Im from Chicago and love thick pan pizza, but not from Uno's. They may have invented it, but Lou Malnati's has perfected it! My salad was very good, cold & crisp, the hot artichoke appetizer was delish and I was told the shrimp scamp was very good, but the highlight was the chocolate cake. It  was outstanding! The piece was large enough that we cut it into 14 pieces and all had a taste (we had a bday in the group and no one wanted dessert cuz we were full but a few bites was fine).   We had 14 in our group, each couple had their own pizza, some ordered appetizers or salad, each a different drink, and one special gluten free pizza. Anastasia, got everything right, kept glasses filled, the orders correct and everyone's bill was right and delivered to the correct couple. She did it all on her own with a smile and conversation with all of us. She had a great sense of humor and joined us in our merriment.   I wouldn't go back for pizza, but would try something different and would definitely ask for Anastasia.   I like mild Italian sausage on my pizza and this pizza had a kick I wasn't expecting nor enjoyed. Im not sure if it was the sauce or the sausage but I just didn't like it.   All in all we had fun, prices reasonable, service & server terrific. You'll have to make up your mind on the pizza."}
{"text":"Horrible experience tonight.   Orderded a small thin crust  cheese pizza.   When our food arrived, the other two meals at the table were good (shrimp scampi and a burger).  My pizza on the other hand was not.   It was missing cheese on about a third of it.  The center of the pizza was just dried sauce baked on crust.  I  obviously sent it back.   45 minutes later a replacement came.   That was a good 15-20 minutes after the others at my table completely finished their meals. At that point I just asked for a box and left.   The other Unos in Madison closed.....if it was run like this location,  I completely understand why."}
{"text":"If you are looking for something similar to Chicago style pizza, this is probably your best bet.  However, it is nowhere near what you will get if you go to the Uno's in Chicago or a similar place in the city.  My favorite thing about the deep dish pizza in Chicago is how fresh the dough and ingredients are.  At the Uno's in Pittsburgh however you don't really get that.  The dough did not taste house made and the sauce tasted like it was canned.  The pizza also fell apart very easily.  For someone who loves true Chicago deep dish, this place was a major disappointment."}
{"text":"THIS LOCATION IS NOW CLOSED!  We used to go here A LOT!  In the past year it has declined markedly.  Menu screw ups - even for allergic reaction prevention - were frequent.  Training the kitchen staff would have been helpful to PREVENT THIS LOCATION'S CLOSING!  I will not go to East Towne for Uno's. We will miss the Rattlesnake Pasta.  I could no longer order the Cobb Salad."}
{"text":"We were promptly greeted at the entrance and led to a comfortable and clean booth. The waitress came by to take our order. The food was delivered to our table at a good pace. My berry and goat cheese starter salad tasted delicious so was 5 stars. The nachos entree did not have enough cheese so was 3 stars. Our entrees of a deep-dish pizza and chicken parmesan and pasta tasted OK so were 3 stars. The waitress was friendly but never brought drink refills, so we were out of drinks and thirsty at the end of our meals."}
{"text":"I ate here at around 8:00 on a Saturday night.  Reading the other reviews, it makes me wonder if people were a the same restaurant I was.  Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  You should know that going into any chain, really.  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price.  We were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.  Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food.    My fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  I had the potato skin appetizer.  It reminds me of a \"baked potato pizza\" that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo.  It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.  Overall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?  It won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago."}
{"text":"For an upscale chain, Uno actually left a decent impression on me. It's certainly much better than say Applebees. The prices are a bit high, although they seem to have all sorts of different daily or late night specials all the time. For our part, we came here because we got a random $10 gift card in the mail.  The menu was pretty extensive, and it was difficult to narrow down our choices to anything. In the end we chose to go with their nominal Numero Uno deep dish pizza, along with the Chicken Spinocolli pasta. Our waitress tried to ask us to order more, though she wasn't overly pushy. The food was pretty good. I was surprised at how filling the deep dish pizza was, despite its deceivingly small size. The individual portion was definitely enough for one. The pasta came with a stuffed chicken breast full of cheese, sauce, and vegetables. All the while I was eating it, I felt guilty for my arteries but enjoyed it so much.  I'd probably deduct a star because of the lack of service we got after the food arrived. Our waitress checked on us once, but it was quite a while between us finishing and her bringing over the check. It was near closing time so there weren't as many people around, but she was nowhere to be seen. Maybe it was just a bad night.  I will probably make a note to try the steak and/or flat breads next time. But overall an okay place."}
{"text":"We went there on Monday found out they were closed. Not big deal we went somewhere else. So we tried again today Tuesday and it was slow so we figured it would be pretty fast. We got seated right away but didn't see our server for at least 5 minutes. Not even someone saying I will be right with you just to acknowledge a table. Being a server myself for over 10 years even if you are busy you just let the table know you will be right with them. Our food came fast and was good but my husband didn't get steak sauce and she didn't come back to check. We were done eating and the server was no where to be found. We could not get a box and finally went up front to pay. We just ended up leaving the left overs there because we were not going to wait."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot about 4-5 years ago. But then I stopped for one reason or another.  I came back again tonight after the long hiatus, and I was disappointed. The deep dish personal pepperoni pizza wasn't very good -- the sauce tasted bland, the crust tasted oily and a bit overcooked or stale, and there wasn't much flavor to the cheese. I haven't been feeling well and thought it might just be me, but my husband tried it and said the same thing. He also said his chicken parmesan sauce tasted bland.  I feel bad -- it was a little like looking at an old Taylor Swift album you used to love five years ago, except now you realize the songs were sappy and she looked completely different. I used to love Uno, but it's not at all what I remembered it to be."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Good food and great service! It was a slow night so the bartender played trivia with us. They always make us feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Great staff and food. The potato skins deep dish thing is amazing. I don't care much for salads normally but love the honey crisp chicken salad."}
{"text":"Expensive for food that is mediocre.  The wait time for the food was incredibly long and they weren't even that busy.  Lame."}
{"text":"My girlfriends made reservations here for my bachelorette party last Saturday. I highly suggest that you make reservations because we were able to just walk right in and sit down. There were people there waiting 30 minutes+. We had the sangria which was amazing. Our sever Alex recommend it and it was perfect for the 4 of us.  I had their thin crust pepperoni pizza which really hit the spot. My two friend had salads which they said were amazing and my other friend joined me in ordering a pesto chicken pizza. Let's just say there wasn't any food left on the table when we were finished.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst overpriced pizza there is.  Nearly $20 for a pepperoni pizza for two would be okay if it were good.   Crust is extremely dry and unflavorful.  If you want a good deep dish pizza, try Burghs Pizza and Wing pub in Bridgeville.   Their deep dish is thicker, tastier crust, better sauce, and a lot more cheese/toppings.   Cheaper too.  Service was just barely adequate on this visit."}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to some shroom pizza and a visit to UNO. The only time we get it, is when we hit the Dells or IL. This visit really sucked and was super disappointing.   Walked in. Waited at the host stand for 5 min. I get it the host was busy. He was sweet and eventually seated us. Thank god he got our drinks. We sat there for about 15-20 minutes before our server finally came over. She just seemed really non chalant and we asked to order. She was like, oh ok. After sitting there for that long we knew what we wanted.   Pizzas were okay. Seem to take awhile for two little pizzas. The número UNO had hardly any meat on it. The shroom was good. Our server asked if we wanted to box it up to go because it looked like we had our hands full with our toddler. We were both like, no, we'll eat it here. Our toddler was just hungry. He did spill his milk. I asked for some extra napkins. Those came way later.  I asked for the tab before we were done. Again, that took forever.we had our card out she left and then sauntered back. Everything just took a super long time when it didn't have to.   I usually tip even with bad service at least 10 percent, but this service was just terrible and the inference of asking us to box our food up and leave was just the last straw. Maybe it wasn't meant that way, but it was the last straw. There were kids acting worse than ours with spilled milk and no napkins to clean it up. Yes, we cleaned it up after the 2 napkins finally came .  Such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Ate here a couple months ago and food and service were terrible. They were out of stuff on the menu for both the items we ordered including (a pasta dish and a pizza). They ran out of napkins and sent someone to giant eagle to get them. The workers congregated at the door talking and not waiting on customers. Will not go back. Absolutely terrible service. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Wham! 4 stars outta the park! The deep-dish pizza we had was amazing. I wasn't crazy about the avocado egg rolls, but the chocolate chip sundae was superb. Great service too from Maranda, a doll. Decor is cute. Ambience is lively. Recommended."}
{"text":"Watch your credit card slips Rick will change the tips on them.   I complained and came in again for the first time since the issue ...saw him and still have a bad taste over it."}
{"text":"I really love deep dish pizza. The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy, peppery sauce that can singe your tongue. The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:  French onion Chicken bites Pizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano  Looking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good.   I really never want to return."}
{"text":"My my what a turn of events! This was a lunch setup that we wanted to go for another round of their Deep Dish that we'd liked from our previous encounter. Not sure if the chef is different between Lunch and Dinner but boy this was disappointing (See my notes below)  Now, having recently been to Giordano's, I can now say for sure what a Deep Dish REALLY is. Still, our last time with Uno was a good \"Almost\" deep dish pizza. This time was a shocker. We ordered a Large Deep Dish pizza with Chicken, Ham and Onions. Here are my thoughts:  - The pizza did not have the crust of a deep dish pizza nor did it have the amount of cheese and tomato you expect - Chicken was bare minimum with a small piece each on almost every slice! - Finding Ham on the pizza was like finding Big Foot! - Onion was in scrapes and mostly burnt - Crust was a little soft from underneath - Best for the last : We had a Green Paper sticker thing baked into our pizza (Pic attached)  I'm saddened by our recent experience because I really thought this place had a decent deep dish to offer outside of Chicago. You just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Had the most horrifying experience at this place!!!! WARNING: DO NOT GO HERE!  We went there for the first time for some deep dish pizza and were expecting a Chicago deep dish pizza experience but oh boy, little did we know what we were in for!   So after watching a nice movie we went there for dinner and added a deep pan pizza with our favorite toppings! What we got was shameful! Our pizza was out fairly quickly to our surprise but just after taking one looking at it we could tell that it was made some time earlier that morning!!!!!! The pan was not even hot or mildly warm! We called the waiter right away and told him that the pizza was ice cold and the least we expect is freshly made food! He wasn't too happy that had to do extra work but he took the pizza back into the kitchen for a new one.   You guys will not believe what we got after that!!! Some 20mins later we were served the same pizza which was BURNT!!! I kid you not literally BURNT ( ALL THE TOPPINGS WERE CHARRED) we could not believe our eyes and the people running that place! Firstly the chef did that on purpose cuz only a blind person would serve someone that!! I guess he got offended that his customers asked for fresh food cuz that's an offense at this place! Secondly the waiter had some balls to serve us that black charred pizza!!! I mean was he blindfolded too!!! My husband and I looked at the pizza and we asked for the cheque! Glad they did not make us pay for that s***!! I guess the waiter did feel a little embarrassed at the end but god only knows how that place is still running! We left that place hungry and ended up getting McDonalds! So watch out for this place!"}
{"text":"I've hit this Uno's everytime I'm in Verona/Madison for my deep dish cravings. It is a nice location with a nice building and multi-levels and rooms. Huge menu of options with tons to try other then their awesome pizza (a must have/try). There is so much to try on the menu that sounds awesome... but other appetizers, I just have to get my pizza each and every time. So I have to taste sample from every one else. I'm working my way faster through the menu that way ;)  They also have a large Gluten Free menu, with pizza even (and it was tasty).  Staff is friendly and accommodating. They even did a private room with private buffet of pizzas and salad for a large group we had and just did a \"pay per person\" at the end.  They also have a large selection of beers and drinks to choose from. And Spotted Cow on tap... which if you're in WI, you got to sling a few back."}
{"text":"I don't care what Cub and Bulls fans think, this Steeler and Penguins fan thinks deep dish pizza is not all that. First, the crust tastes like a biscuit, and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza. I will give UNOs a thumbs up on it's flatbread, it's better pizza than some pizzerias In the area. When I look over uno's menu almost nothing excites me, this place is a dud. Guess what? Chicagoans don't know how to eat hot dogs either!"}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal and the service was excellent. I was very impressed by the waitress and the manager checked in with us as well. They got one of our orders a little incorrect, but we had never been there and wouldn't have noticed if they hadn't pointed it out. We told them it was fine, but they went above and beyond to correct it, anyway. (They were right, it was even better made the correct way.) I highly recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Had a chance Friday night to visit an old favorite. My wife and I were in the mood for pizza and we hadn't been to Uno's in awhile so, viola!   The best thing about Pizzeria Uno is that you know what you're going to get (in a good way) and that is great Chicago style deep dish pizza. This trip didn't disappoint. We decided to mix things up a bit and also order their new thin crust pizza. Both were fantastic. The deep dish was everything you wanted deep dish pizza to be, flavorful, gooey, cheesy and filling.  The thin crust was a great complement. You still got the flavor and the cheese but also a light, airy crust that really had a good taste in its own right.   Our server was great and very attentive without being overbearing. The manager even stopped by to see how our visit went. We sat in the bar and it was very clean and there were TVs to watch if you were so inclined.   All in all, the Pizzeria Uno in Madison is still a great place for deep dish pizza and some good wine or beer.  I highly recommend it and wonder why my wife and I didn't visit there sooner."}
{"text":"My friend and I have never eaten here before so last night we decided to check it out. For a Thursday it wasn't that crowded and we were seated promptly. There were plenty of flat screens and warm lighting that made the place cozy. We ordered a thin crust pizza: on one side there was chicken, hamburger and pepperoni (for him) while the other side had just pepperoni (for me). I was expecting the pizza to be bland and warm but it was surprisingly hot and savory. I even tried a slice of my friend's pizza and the hamburger and chicken were moist, not dried out. This wasn't bad for a first visit so I will definitely be back in the future to try more menu items. I'm only giving Uno 4 stars because the waitress brought us a plate that still had old food stuck to it. Hello! The plate was yellow! How could she not have seen that?!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after seeing a movie across the street.  The place wasn't very busy for a late Saturday night and I think we were the only ones sitting in the bar area.  This place had some New Glarus on tap which is a must anytime I am in Wisconsin.   Our server was great and got us everything we needed quickly.  It wasn't till after we were served our food that we realized we didn't have any silverware.  It took a while for our server to come back into the room but once he did we waved him down and he promptly brought out silverware for us.    We both really enjoyed our pasta dishes.  And there was plenty of food and I ended up taking half mine home."}
{"text":"Well this visit started off good. I was seated right away, no wait. Was given a good beer selection of some PA Craft beers. Ordered the traditional deep dish pizza, but with no onions. Now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. Was never asked if I wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. My pizza still had onions in it. Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza.   Now onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point. I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for.  Bottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as I don't know how the rest of the servers are. Was just horrible."}
{"text":"As a recent Chicago transplant, I've really been missing Chicago pizza. Imagine my amazement when I discovered that there was an Uno's in Madison!   Wrong. While the original Pizzaria Uno (at Ohio and Wabash) is wonderful, something is lost in translation here. I can't even explain it. It's just bad.   The hunt for good deep dish in Madison continues..."}
{"text":"Today was a good day at Uno.     When you join the Uno rewards program, you receive coupons and points. Today was kids eat free for the holiday. The kids menu has an make your own pizza option, which is always a fun activity for them. They also have a choice of a personal pizza(not a make your own), Mac and cheese, tiny Dino chx nuggets, kids sliders, and hot dog, and more. They also had a good choice of sides for them as well. Fries, grapes, broccoli, a side salad, and rice.    The lunch menu is what we ordered from today, which is a must when you go for lunch. They have a pick 2 menu with 3 pick options. $6.99 you can get a choice of endless soup bar with 4 different soups, and a choice of salads. $7.99 you get a choice of endless soup bar and either a pizza of the day or sandwich or a salad. And the 8.99 choices(I didn't make it that far on the menu for choices), I think it was a choice of salad and a choice of either pizza or pasta dish?     The kids personal pizza was about 8 inches and filling. The Mac and cheese was also big and had a side of a breadstick. Both choices were good portion sizes to fill my lil ones bellies.     The honey crisp chicken salad was a dinner size(it was big), with lettuce, tomato, red bell pep, onion, cheddar cheese, little crisps, and crispy chicken tenders, topped with a honey mustard dressing. It was a big portion and very delish. The 2nd choice was a personal deep dish pizza. Very good.    The soup bar today had minestrone, clam chowder, broccoli and cheddar, and tomato. All the soups at the bar were served warm and very tasteful. And the fact that they had tobasco at the bar, won my heart. The second lunch choice was a flat bread prosciutto and arugula. The flat bread was brushed with a garlic and oil, with mozzarella, then the prosciutto and arugula, red bell peppers and topped with a balsamic glaze! It was the regular dinner size and so yum for half the cost!     The amount of food they serve you for the lunch specials is beyond my understanding. I just don't know how they do it. The food was very good and the service was very good as well. This is a definite return choice for lunch again soon. Very pleased!"}
{"text":"If you like your pizza's crust to be more buttered than Donald Trump's butthole, this is the place for you. Buttery, flaky, and just down right American inside and out; this pizza was pretty good."}
{"text":"I would write anthems, poems, novels about their pizza.   I've dreamed of their pizza since I was a child. My only encounter with my beloved Uno was when my mother came home with a take out box that she ordered for lunch that day.  I would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off the loose toppings from the box. The cold 4 hour old pizza has since plagued my mind.  I desperately tried to find an Uno but found that the nearest one had closed down. CLOSED DOWN. My dreams were crushed, my psyche disturbed. I had become a changed person. I wanted more. I needed more. My mother stopped coming home with Uno take out boxes. I stopped eating pizza. I hated the flimsy crusts that were just cheap variants from my beloved Uno, I despised the New york style that you could so easily fold. Feh, I would resign from eating pizza till I had my precious. My precious, my Uno deep dish.   It wasn't until that fated day when I drove past an Uno. The neon lights called out to me, it was like seeing heaven for the first time. I stumbled into the Uno. Dazed, the smell was like nothing I had ever experienced on this green Earth.  There was nothing I could compare it too. I sat down and ordered the Numero Uno with a side of fries.  \"No not personal...Regular.\" I wanted the entire thing, not just a wedge of a dream. I wanted the whole thing.   It came out, steaming. Bubbling. Oozing. Fresh. So fresh. I took a bite - the cheese was perfectly melted. And then another - the dough was so thick and tasteful. And then another - ooh that sausage... Until there was nothing left.   I had achieved my dream. But I will be back for more. I will be back..for my precious.   But the fries were mediocre."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when I walked in, but I am now a fan. There is a cool way to review the menu on a touch kiosk to find out the calorie count.   The place looked nice. It was clean and really cool looking. The food was really good and our waiter was nice and friendly. I will be going back to try their pizza and other food.   We had a burger, which was really good, and we had the lobster slider. French fries were good to."}
{"text":"Good food good service. Went today around 5 pm and had a female waitress and a trainee and both were excellent and attentive. The tablets on the table are entertaining and fun. Its a bit pricey for us but nice once in a while."}
{"text":"Pulled into the parking lot with a friend on 2/14, around 1pm and all the signs were gone, no cars in the lot, it was dark inside and the doors were locked. Can anyone confirm whether they are still open for business??"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night.  Boy was the place dead!  I was the only only Customer at 8:30PM.  Ordered a thin crust pizza with extra cheese, pepperoni and mushrooms.  It was pretty good.  Could of used more cheese.   I wasn't in the mood for the heavy crusted deep dish pizza. This is my first time at this location but have been to several of the other locations in the US.  It was just like the others.  The Caesar salad with anchovies was very good.  The service was very poor.  My waitress spent a lot of time chit-chatting with the hostess.  It was a chore to get water refills from her.    They have big screen televisions in the bar area which can be seen from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered online and picked up...20 mins later, I was enjoying deep dish and artisan style pizzas.  Pizzas were great and affordable...will def order again. Glad it's very close to me."}
{"text":"This will be the best deep dish you can get in Madison. Falbos-eh. Pizza Extreme-wet mess. We ordered a buffalo chicken pizza with pineapples instead of tomatoes and it was really good. They no longer offer it so we haven't found the opportunity to come back. It is a tad pricey but yummy.   We need to address this very serious issue. Where are the peppers? No banana peppers. No jalepeno peppers. Those two are extremely delicious and you refuse to offer them, meh I guess I'll pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good food.    I guess one reason I like this place is they don't hide how bad the food is for you. There is a little Kiosk with all the calories right by the door.  All in all I get the flat bread pizzas and really enjoy them  The steaks are also good and the price is reasonable.  Service is always friendly and the establishment is kept really clean and neat"}
{"text":"This place was gross. I paid almost $10 for a drink I'm fairly certain had no booze in it (it was a Long Island iced tea!) and I paid another $12 for the slimiest portobello mushroom sandwich I've ever encountered. Room temperature, too! Which is I guess the only way to serve a slimy mushroom sandwich. My husbands burger looked like it was made out of tires. I was so pleased with my decision to upgrade my side ($1 charge) for FOUR delightful onion rings. That were also room temperature. Also something smelled really bad in there. ALSO I asked about how the soup bar worked and our server looked like she had no idea there was one.    Never again."}
{"text":"Love the honey crisp chicken salad. It's my go-to dish here.  I actually crave it.  Nuff said. You can feel free to order pizza. I'll stick with my salad."}
{"text":"Good food. Somehow the deep dish pizza takes less time to bake/come out than it would in Chicago. I used to live in Chicago and the pizza is just as good as what we'd get there. Good service. Good atmosphere. I just wish that the carried some other Chicago comfort food (Chicago style hot dog or Italian beef)"}
{"text":"Me and my friend went to eat over there. I order myself a Burger with two pettys one of pettys was well done and one of them was medium. And the food wasn't that tasty and it wasn't fresh. On top of that me and my friend got sick for the past two today. Highly not recommend!"}
{"text":"We woke up late and missed the breakfast hours of our favorite place. We needed to go to the Waterfront for errands so we decided to have lunch there. It was around 11:30 and the restaurant was mostly empty. They say is in the back near the doorway to the kitchen. We were waiting and waiting for our waitress to come. During that time we realized that there was a child's birthday party 2 tables away. There were 3 tables of young boys and a table of parents. They were mostly well behaved but they were LOUD!!  Our waitress finally came and took our orders. While we were waiting for food there was a waitress standing right inside the kitchen door complaining about her day job. She went on and on about how bad it was and how she was looking for a new job. So in one ear I had a complaining waitress and birthday party in the other.  We were about to get up and leave when our food came. I had the Wedge Salad. It was ok but not something I would order again. My husband's salad, Italian Chopped, was better. It had a brightness that my salad lacked. IF I ever went back, and that's a BIG IF, I would order that salad. I had the personal size Chicago pizza. It had huge chunks of tomatoes, sausage, and cheese. For something that took so long to get it should have been hot. It was room temperature. I only ate half. My husband got the ziti with sausage. It was salty. I managed one bite and was done. My husband has a higher tolerance for salt so he was able to eat it. What we came away with from this experience is to leave. Don't try to stay when the experience is that bad. We were throughly disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The food is decent. The Atmosphere is nice too. Service was just average each time. I would come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Uno's for dinner last night. We were promptly seated by the host in a section with 4 other occupied tables.  We sat and waited over 20 minutes and no one stopped at our table. There were other tables seated after us, which were promptly greeted by servers.   We decided to leave and on our way out,  I informed the host that no one had been to our table yet despite several employees (including a manager) walking past us.  Unfortunately,  the host was too busy chatting with a server to really care.  He asked if we wanted to speak to a manager, but we were so frustrated with the way we were treated,  we decided to leave instead of listening to a manager make excuses for his inattentive staff."}
{"text":"I give it 5 at the bar. When I'm in the waterfront shopping, hungry and thirsty I stop in for a snack and a beer. Jen is great and the happy hour specials are nice, I'm always happy with a draft and flat bread or salad."}
{"text":"Had our car in for service nearby so decided to try lunch.  OK atmosphere.  We ordered what we thought was a personal size deep dish pizza to split since we didn't need a huge lunch and this looked ok for $12.49.  Hubby thought it was OK, I thought the crust was tasteless and the sausage was fatty.  Then we got the bill - and the pizza was listed as $20.99!  Well, we misread the menu.  The thin crust 10\" was $10-something so we thought the $12.49 would have been the 10 inch deep dish.  Not so!  The $12.49 was for a 7\" pizza!!  The \"REGULAR\" pizza was a mere 10\" and was barely enough for the two of us and was $20.99!  And to top it off, hubby's 14 oz beer was $5.29!  So our \"inexpensive\" lunch cost us over $30 with tip - what a rip off!!! Better be sure you read the tiny little print to know what you're getting.  Now if you want the REAL Uno's pizza, take a drive to Platteville, WI and have one of the best pizzas of your life!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am glad that Western Pennsylvania has one remaining outlet for the great Chicago-style deep dish pizza offered by Uno, its pioneer.  Dining here brought back memories of an excellent meal I enjoyed in Chicago last month at Uno subsidiary, Pizzeria Due.  The restaurant is attractive and comfortable, and the outdoor seating by the river a delight.  The tables outside, though, are too close and if all are occupied, one can hear every word of what is said at neighboring tables.  The spinach and chicken pizza, appetizers of zucchini chips and spinach and artichoke dip were all delicious, but the zucchini was extremely salty.  Our server was pleasant and attentive, performing many quality checks.  $20.99 is a lot to pay for a pizza, but the deep dish pies are hearty and plenty for two people. $7.75 for a small glass of house wine is excessive.  The $4.99 tariff for the single serving appetizers was fair for the quality and the portion sizes.  The weak link was the young lady who seated us.  She was glum, unfriendly, and without a smile.  Instead of saying \"Enjoy your meal\" when seating customers, she says, \"There you are.\"  How a customer is greeted can set the tone for a meal and this is an important facet of the front of the house operation. At The Cheesecake Factory, the host staff is trained to engage the customer in pleasant conversation while leading the guest to the table. The individual at Uno got us off to a poor start.  A nice touch would be for a manager to provide a quality check and make the diner feel welcome."}
{"text":"I really don't know why I bother with chain restaurants anymore.  Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.    My husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.    When the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: \"chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.\"  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate \"drizzling\" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.  What we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.    The \"numero uno\" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.    The ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.    And lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?  It's baffling."}
{"text":"My family went here tonight for the first time. I have two young children one is three and the other one is six months. I found it to be very family-friendly. When we entered a very nice host seated us at a very nice table. He was all smiles and very friendly. He gave us a booth with lots of room for the car seat. We sat down and we were greeted immediately by the waitress. She was very helpful with my husbands dairy allergy. She took our order quickly and with a smile. The zucchini chips appetizer was delicious. We Ordered a pizza with eggplant on it and it was really good. I would definitely order that again. The vegetables were grilled perfectly and the sauce tasted really good. The cheese wasn't undercooked. The pizzas little expensive for the size they are but they are really tasty. The only other negative I would say that the floors under the booths were a bit dirty. Other than that I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"All in favor of a deep dish pizza say I!.......IIIIIII,  ok now that i have that out of my system. This place is such a great hangout/eat-in spot. I hadn't been here and years and some friends invited us out for the evening. I was so glad they were paying cause  I was low on funds at the time.  We arrived on a friday night and of course it was busy there. We waited about 10 minutes to get a table which wasn't bad considering the crowd. We looked over the menu and they have so many great choices. Pizza, pasta, appetizers, seafood, burgers, salads and sandwiches.   After ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food. We both are going gluten free which is tough but UNO's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. Plus! They make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. My hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and I ordered the Guac-alicious burger with a Caesar side salad. My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.  I'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount.   We came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what?? I will probably always eat this pizza whenever I come.   Only down side is slow service. It took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked. He got the numero uno which was ok but mine had way more flavor!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday , small crowed for 12:30 on a football day , our server was very friendly , took 5 try's before I found a beer that they had in stock but we made it , I'm crazy when it comes to craft beers and trying the selection you have but keep them in stock it's not that hard anymore , had the 2 for $12.99 , I had the Chicago classic and Italian salad both out standing salad was very large and pizza was just the right size for a lunch , all in all great place for lunch just buy some beer"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a bite and a beer. Service is quick, friendly and accurate. They've got a respectable selection of craft beers and the atmosphere is very clean and comfortable. Good view of the TV from any angle in the bar area (watching a Bucco's game at the moment) and the bar itself is full service. The Baked Stuffed Spinoccoli chicken that I had was delicious. I have no idea why I don't come here more often... I should!"}
{"text":"Update- This Unos has improved. Lunchtime service is fast and Very Friendly. Almost as delicious as the buttery crust and fresh tomatoes. Salads are crisp, even if dressing is average. All in all a solid lunch place. Very affordable. The atmosphere is cozy and good for talking with colleagues. Lunch meetings away!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a Guacamole burger and fries for lunch a last week. It was good but not memorable."}
{"text":"Large portions of pasta. Delicious pizza- as always. There is a large outdoor deck with a lovely view of the sunset. We had plenty of food leftover for a second night. Fast service. Fun environment. It was lovely!"}
{"text":"Holy cow the pizza was amazing. So was our cranberry, almond, and grape salad. And we really enjoyed the Wisconsin Spotted Cow beer. Our server gave our children the option to make their pizzas at the table. Elise was great, just how a server should be. She anticipated our needs but was never obtrusive. A great meal, and a great value too. We'd certainly come back next time we're in the area. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I had the Lemon basil salmon (very dry) with under cooked brussel sprouts & bacon.  It took long for our food to come out & when it did, I still had to wait for my mashed potatoes.."}
{"text":"Strawberry Walnut salad was excellent - tender chicken, fresh strawberries and mixed greens, and perfectly sweet candied walnuts with feta cheese sprinkled throughout! The roasted eggplant, spinach, and feta flatbread also tasted fresh, which surprised me considering the short wait of 5 minutes or so. The entire dish was layered with thick slices of tomato, and I liked actually being able to taste the eggplant. The pesto sauce was prominent without overpowering the other elements of the dish. Well worth the $12 Pick and Choose price IMO. I did find a curly, black, and fine strand of hair at the side of the salad plate, so a small star off for that.  I had a coupon for a free dessert,  so I asked for the mini chocolate peanut butter cup. It was good but not memorable. I liked that there were mini chocolate chip with the peanut butter though. I'm not sure if the outer chocolate was intended to be rock hard or if the cold ice cream on it had simply hardened it, but it was extremely difficult to cut through with a mere spoon. For a free dessert, it satisfied me though.   The server, Christy B, was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal as well!"}
{"text":"Pizza is a staple for me. I love everything about crunch crust, a nice rich tomato sauce, and a thick layer of melted cheese. I have never tried Chicago style pizza before and when we had to rescue our friends from car troubles, Uno's was right there so we decided to try it out.   Only a 30 minute wait for a Saturday is pretty good for any restaurant in the Waterfront. We were seated at a booth in the bar area. The tables were clean and it was a big booth so the four of us were not squished. Only complaint, the bar was loud and when they did blended drinks you had to pause your conversation because the blenders were so loud. Good news, only happened twice!  The four of us decided to order two pizzas, the Pepperoni and the Farmers Market. I also ordered a Caesar salad because I needed more vegetables in my life.    The salad. It was a big salad that I shared with my boyfriend. The croutons were huge and very crunchy. The Caesar dressing was not creamy, it was vinegar based and had a little bit of a \"bite\" to it as Chris kept on saying. I thought the bite had more to do with the vinegar than anything spicy, but who am I to say.  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy and they even added tomatoes like I requested.   The main dishes came out about 10 minutes later. I do not know what I was expecting but the pizzas were not as large as I was imagining. Two of the larger pizzas looked like personal pizzas to me. But!!!! I was soon to see that even if they are a bit smaller they were filled to perfection.   The Farmers Market pizza had caramelized onions, spinach, SUN DRIED AMAZING TOMATOES, regular tomatoes, eggplant, pesto as a sauce, and a blend of cheeses. The crust was perfection being so crisp and light that I stole Chris' extra from his plate. The sun dried tomatoes were great adding just enough sweetness to the pizza that I went looking for the slices with the most on them. It was a really really good pizza. We even ended up taking slices home with us! My eyes deceived me at first with the size!   Then our friends told us that we had to try the cookie pizza. Cookie pizza? What sorcery is this? Matt, the one who suggested it said that we would not be disappointed. This cookie came out in a really large, bigger than our pizzas, dish. It had three scoops of icecream on it with a pile of whipped cream. WARM, right out of the oven, fresh cookie pizza. Oh sweet heavens, it was good. I am glad that I had enough room in my stomach to pile in that sweet goodness.   Chicago Pizza, I would absolutly try again."}
{"text":"Deep-Dish vs. Thin Crust: A needless ideological war. Both are valid and are equally delectable when done correctly. Having gotten that out into the sphere of discussion in the hopes of diffusing the silly, stylistic hostilities, I'll have to admit to not eating much in the way of deep-dish pizzas in my time simply due to a lack of exposure. Face it, kids. We're in Pittsburgh and not Chi-Town. That's not a slight against Pittsburgh's doughy pies, which have a right to exist and do so respectably and deliciously. Nonetheless, I could use more deep-dish dining experience.   Ever since feasting (beasting?) on a deep-dish, torte-like masterpiece at Juliano's in McKees Rocks a few years ago, I'd been craving that manner of pizza. A segment on a Food Network program about Chicago's famed Uno further billowed the flames. A trip to the Waterfront for shopping purposes led us to One! A singular sensation! Cue the dancers!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOhpkxi-lOc  I don't do musicals.   Maranda, our gracious waitress, brought to us an oven-demon of our own conception.  We doubled up on the goat cheese and added sausage to a pizza  within a pan that resembled a circular fortress of cast iron. Maranda would make the first cut, a mozzarella/romano blend would stretch like protoplasm, forming gossamer strands of milky, lardy, lusty desire.   The sausage came in juicy, deformed gobs. The sauce was chunky, gory, and malevolently robust like a dark, vampiric lord. The crust, which had a taste and mouthfeel somewhere betwixt an animal cracker and Brioche, was scrumptious enough to eat by itself. No chain pizzeria, despite its admirable pedigree and historical weight, has a right to be serving up such brilliant, compelling evil.   If these pies are pre-made or processed or whatnot, then Uno's is being guided by unseen forces that are not to be tampered with by foolish mortals.   Eschewing Uno's other warm, ice cream-topped desserts, one of which involves a large peanut butter cup (!), I decided to stick with a classic in the Uno Deep Dish Sundae. Akin to the late Gullifty's Killer Kookie For Two, an oversized chocolate chip cookie is baked to order in a seasoned, blackened pan and is garnished with the usual creamery accoutrements in hot chocolate sauce and vanilla. The key to chocolate chip cookies I've found is salt, and it propelled the igneous, decadence-studded devil disc into anti-cosmic orbit. The ice cream and whipped cream kept the colossal cookie from being overly indulgent by cutting the sweetness and richness down a few meters. These types of sundaes are commonplace (Uno's offers up a brownie version as well, of course), but they are so only because they are magnificent when made properly, and Uno's is almost definitive.   My deducted star is not due to prejudice against chains but for the avocado eggrolls we had as an appetizer. We didn't need 'em. Maranda said they'll be taken off the menu soon, and it was easy to taste why as they were lifeless packets of sour, hot guacamole. Dismissed. No, a crisp, fresh, tasty, already ranch-dressed (just enough I might add) salad, the pizza (which we didn't finish, taking the remainder home), and a shared dessert were plenty of dinner for Kay and I.   If this is a taste of The Windy City, then I'm runnin' late for the next train. So long...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkwYL2BKdfI  P.S. Hardly tacky, I rather fancied the decor and lively, fun, cordial, happy-hour climate of Uno's. The service was honestly superlative to boot, and aside from the appetizer, everything was impeccably prepared. Fast food this wasn't. Give your snobbery and regional biases (what is a 'real pizza' anyway?) the night off and enjoy yourself here."}
{"text":"There isn't anything special about it, but I do appreciate that they have gluten free pizza and it has worked out well. We have had our order wrong a couple times when it was busy, they were very apologetic, but still annoying."}
{"text":"I hardly ever give reviews but felt this needed to be said. Hopefully UNOs will fix the problems they see in their reviews. We live about 40 minutes from UNOs and try to get there whenever we can. Our entire family loves deep dish pizza. We always get 2 so that we can have leftovers for the next day.   Today we stopped in and ordered 2 pan style pizzas, Chicago classic & pepperoni. Got home and sat down at the supper table to a pepperoni pizza and a black olive/green pepper pizza. Imagine the disappointment driving all that way and then only being able to eat one of the pizzas(kids won't eat black olives & parents can't eat green peppers). Very disappointed family tonight.  So my experience prior to this was about a month ago. The restaurant was busy for a Sunday afternoon. It was raining so everyone was inside. We put our name on the wait list and decided to sit in the bar. The bartender didn't acknowledge us. She was too busy talking and joking around with the waitstaff. We waited 20 minutes before our table was ready and no drinks. We decided our visit today that we would order pizza at the wait station and go sit in our vehicle so we wouldn't have to sit in the bar. We didn't want to risk another disappointment.   I think we will be searching for a new pizza restaurant. Sorry UNOs."}
{"text":"We called in an order for delivery from our hotel, which advertised them on their room keys and gave us a delivery menu, only to be told they don't start delivery until 5pm. So...take note of that.  The pizzas were decent. We got some crazy deals, I think, because our order *should* have come out to waaaay more. Maybe it was a discount for them not delivering at lunch time..."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a hybrid of Applebee's and CPK, which isn't to say it's bad, but nothing to rave about either. I got their slider meal, which was tiny (for me) and my friend got their steak (which was way tiny). The food was fine and the service was okay, but really felt like an Applebee's knockoff (and Applebee's isn't even worth knocking-offing anyway).   3 stars"}
{"text":"I was a very big fan of the delivery because they have more than just pizza. New York strip, which was cooked perfectly however I am not a fan of the bourbon sauce on it. Overall a great place if you plan on dining in or delivery in the area."}
{"text":"This was my first time at an uno's in about ten years. My kids ordered pizza which was just ok.  I however was pleasently surprised with what I ordered, the bbq firehouse chicken sandwich was absolutely awsome.  Two big thumbs up for the sandwich.  Wait staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great service by Amy, amazing wings and good pizza. I enjoyed my lunch there today. We will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Just went to Uno's with my husband and 3 children. As always the food is excellent, but unfortunately we will never be back. The wait and service were ridicules! The restaurant was not busy at all. Walked in and had to wait for the hostess. We were seated and waited for 10 minutes for a waitress, then waited for another 10 minutes for our drinks. We had to ask where our appetizer was after 20+minutes. The manager came to apologize, offered us a free dessert. Really? A family with 3 young impatient children who have been sitting in a restaurant for over an hour does not want to wait for another long time to get a free dessert. Oh yea, then we had to wait for the check! My husband, 3 year old and I went there about a year ago and service was very slow. We contributed it to being a Saturday night, guess we were wrong. Hey Uno's, if you want to keep business maybe offer a discount on our check! Lost another customer."}
{"text":"Teenage host was unable to help me navigate the online menu to figure out food allergen information (I usually check out new places online before leaving the house, but we decided to stop spur-of-the-moment). Nice kid, but please learn how the company presents allergen information for its customers so you can answer our questions and instill confidence in the dining experience. We moved on to another restaurant. Diners with food allergies proceed with caution; staff might not be the best in helping you make wise choices here.  P.S. In response to the comment from Uno's below, let me further explain: at the time of my visit, I hadn't had a chance to check out the website because we stopped last-minute, so I was using the kiosk in the restaurant to obtain allergen information. The teenage host was unable to answer questions or be of much assistance when I had clarifying questions about the process because Uno's allergen website/kiosk is not as intuitive in its design as other restaurant chains."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service.  I went twice before writing a review.  the first time I thought maybe it was an off day.  The second time, they lost me as a customer.  The wait staff was more interested in talking about their weekend plans than serving customers.  The food was okay, nothing special.  But, for the price, I expect a little more service from a staff that realizes they're not working at Denny's.  Hell, Denny's usually has pretty solid service.  This place will have to go to an extreme to get me to return.  If I could give them zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"Being just moved here, this was a place that was highly recommended to me. One of my favorites is the 9 wheat thin crust BBQ chicken pizza. Its healthier option plus deliciousness makes it one of my favorite places for take out. They have a take out curb-side option which is great. The one time we did dine in, the service was great. The booths that we sat at was a bit dusty and dirty, but nevertheless, we still order take out from this place quite often."}
{"text":"UNO's PIZZERIA absolutely amazing FOOD deep dish little Italy so Delicious,  the best Clam chowder I've ever had. My waiter Ben prompt friendly. I Highly Recommend to Everyone."}
{"text":"I always avoid giving bad reviews on yelp.  I know the impact a review can have on a restaurant, and I respect the level of hard work it takes to be a server, bartender, or manager at a a place like this.  So I don't like to write things that affect people's livelihoods in a negative way.  Sometimes though, experiences happen that are really irritable, and it deserves mentioning to warn others or the establishment that they need to work on improvement.  I've gone to this location quite a few times over the years, and usually it's FINE, but nothing special.  The experience I had tonight was not acceptable for service.  I met my Dad at the restaurant at 7:30, we were going to celebrate my brother's birthday with dinner with him and his girlfriend.  My Dad said the hosts did not approach him at all when he walked in, and him and other customers had to get their attention to put a name in or find if a table was available.  When I got there, the place wasn't that busy, pretty typical dinner service.  I grabbed a seat at the bar with him, and watched as two bartenders circled around the bar but ignored us, mostly talking to themselves.  The bar isn't very big, this was just the first sign of poor service.  Eventually I had to raise my voice and say excuse me to one of them, and was able to get a beer.  We get seated at our table, everyone is in good spirits for my brother's birthday and happy to see each other.  We're talking and looking over the menu, and waiting for our server.  And waiting. . .  Finally after 10-15 minutes he comes by, doesn't seem to be fully aware of what is going on around him, and awkwardly takes our order.  He was mostly friendly during the course of the night, but as time goes on he just doesn't seem to know how to do his job.  He rarely ever checks up on us, and everytime he does he's forgetting things; napkins we asked for, doesn't bring any plates with the appetizers, etc.  We ask for plates for them, and by the time he brings them we're finished with the food.  We order a deep dish pizza for the group, and try to get the largest one they have.  We're talking, but noticing that the time is ticking by.  We're waiting over an hour, with barely a sign of our server.  We flag him down and ask him if he could check on our food.  We then see him start bringing dishes out, to mostly what looks like tables that came after us.  He comes by and brings us a dish we didn't order, and it turns out it's for the table next to us.  All the while, there aren't many tables or people in the place, so I'm really confused as to what his confusion is.  He's looking around the room even when he doesn't have food on his tray like he's unsure of what to do.  He comes back over in a few minutes and tells us the kitchen's backed up and it will just be a little longer.  Well, about an hour and a half or more after we order we finally get our pizza.  It's cut into 6 slices for 4 of us.  Needless to say, 2 slices get left basically for no one, and it's just more frustration on top of the service to beginwith, especially being that everyone is hungry by now.  The waiter seems oblivious to the fact that there's anything wrong with how things have been going, and while he's gone I go up to the front and ask for a manager.  The guy I ask says he'll go find one and has a deer in the headlights look on his face like I just asked him something crazy.  He goes to find the manager, comes back and says she'll be right out.  I wait for 5-10 minutes, and no one comes out.  I tell him to just forget about it as I'm here for my brother's birthday and would like to spend time with him and at this point it's just unnecessary.  I was hoping we could get some kind of discount on the bill and I could explain how our night went so far.  Well, finally we get our bill, it's expensive and no comps.  My Dad and I ask to have it split in half, the server seems confused but says ok.  He comes back and says he really wasn't sure how to do it, and we have differing amounts.  We pay, finish talking and leave.  Sorry, long rant over.  Bottom line, UNOs you need to seriously improve here.  Extremely disappointing and a bad capper on what we were all hoping was going to be a nice evening for my brother.  He works long hours and we don't get to see him very often, this was a real shame."}
{"text":"I've eaten here with my family as well as with coworkers.  The menu accommodates a wide variety of diet choices.  My wife eats gluten free and I work with vegetarians.  All are full when we leave.  Yes, the pizza can be a bit greasy.  But they also serve other foods including pastas and seafood.  Our service has always been wonderful and the food good.  It is a bit pricey though."}
{"text":"My kids who are 3 and 5 ordered the make your own pizza. I initially had some reservations but it was actually fun for them and tasted pretty good too. I'd suggest it for anyone looking to do something sorts cool with their kids for dinner."}
{"text":"Our server was very nice and our pizza was good, but the restaurant floors were very sticky and it didn't give off a very clean vibe. I would love to return and see that the restaurant was cleaned better."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars due to service, I would.  Here with soccer team and kids, and literally had the server put wines in the middle of the table and tell the ladies to smell them and figure out what kind they are.    The server was the most rude I've experienced in years."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my daughter on Father's Day. It was a beautiful evening so we sat outside on the patio. Noise is sometimes an issue here, as the patio is situated at the front of the building on a busy street. However, they do have thick shrubbery to block the rather unattractive view and buffer traffic noise. Service was very good; we had an obviously young waiter who appeared to be a complete novice. Despite his lack of experience and knowledge, he was attentive, found answers to our numerous questions and brought everything out in a reasonable timeframe. My salad was enormous and flavorful. I would have liked almonds or something crunchy on top, but was otherwise very satisfied. My daughter had fish and a couple sides and was happy with it as well. We redeemed a $10 off coupon which was a nice bonus. That, combined with the lovely weather and good food made for a great night."}
