{"text":"Pretty good but overpriced for what you're getting guess it's just the area. Not much value for dollar"}
{"text":"Really good, fresh food . I always add pesto to my sandwiches. You can get a lunch combo for about $10.00 which isn't bad if you want something that will leave you feeling satisfied after lunch."}
{"text":"Overpriced, disgusting food, awful owner.   Not only is Georgie the most unaccommodating owner I've met, he's also CHEAP. I was short .50 while buying a sandwich (I didn't expect prices to be so outrageous) and he wouldn't let it go. He went back and forth with me and finally when he was on the verge of harassing me for the .50 he \"knew I had\" an elder lady behind me gave him a dollar and walked out.   I would have overlooked his awful behavior if the food was amazing but sadly just like his personality it was disgusting and full of nothing, and no one washes their hands in this place! The sandwich had no meat and absolutely no flavor, kind of like him I suppose...   There are definitely far better places to eat in the area where you won't get treated like scum but rather an actual person. Save your money and put it towards a kind person, not this low life.   I've never written a review this long, can't imagine that it would have been if I wrote directly after my experience."}
{"text":"The Financial District is littered with food court offerings most of which are standard and boring chain fare. Fourno offers something a little different, great sandwiches and salads. They're all premade and pressed to order but that is what you need to expect during the lunch rush in this area, but the combinations are novel and the salad offerings are also a change from other options for a quick lunch in the area."}
{"text":"Located in the PATH specializing in panini sandwiches and I have to say...YUM!!!  This was my first visit to the new food court offering and I was impressed. They had a staff member on the customer side of the counter letting new patrons know how to order and what sandwiches were popular. I thought this was very helpful.   I ordered the chicken club made with pancetta and it was delish! They don't over stuff the sandwich with lots of different ingredients or sauces but rather keep it simple and the flavour and freshness really stand out.  I should mention that it is an $8+ sandwich (no drink, no side) but recommend that you give it a try.  Next time I think I will try the ham and swiss on a croissant!  Enjoy!"}
