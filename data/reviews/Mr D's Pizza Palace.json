{"text":"Pizza and crust is the best in town.  Usually have it delivered and are at the house when they say, but give yourself an hour.  Wings are a little overcooked, but still good."}
{"text":"I placed a pick-up order at 7:40 and was told that it would be 20 minutes. That was fine by me as the usual wait that I've had is around 15 minutes. I walked through the doors around 8:10, expecting to immediately pay, get my food and leave. After all, that is the point of carry-out, is it not? Unfortunately, that didn't happen.  When I walked in I gave them my name and paid for my order. But then I had to wait more than 10 minutes to get my food. Unacceptable. There was already a 10 minute buffer that I allowed but apparently 30 minutes still wasn't long enough to prepare two subs. Not once during that extra wait was I acknowledged or told what the hold up was. If I had not already paid for the food, I would have left. When I finally got my food, I didn't even receive an apology for the ridiculous wait time.   When I and the person I was with finally got around to eating our subs, we could taste onion in certain spots. We didn't order onions and there weren't any on the sub. But someone had to have put some on them and then taken them off because onion had clearly permeated parts of the sandwich. My sandwich didn't even have true tomato slices. Just chunks of tomato.   The quality of food and service was sub-par here. This was such a sour experience. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza and their cheese steaks are awesome as well. They deliver which is convenient, and I would recommend trying this place if you haven't. One of my favorite in mt holly."}
{"text":"This is actually my favorite pizza place in the area. It's loaded with toppings and cheese and tastes great. The sandwiches and wings are good too and the blue cheese is amazing. I usually get takeout because I am no longer in the delivery area but have also ate here a few times.  The dining area is ok could be a bit nicer but passable. The food is a little greasy but that should be expected with lots of cheese and toppings. Their meat pizza is my favorite by far."}
{"text":"So I've tried a couple different things here and I'm yet to be impressed.  Today I got there \"Calabria panini\" ...it came on a toasted hoagie bun, with 1 skimpy tomato slice and regular mayo (was supposed to have pesto sauce). It was so bland and the fries were also gross.  Needless to say, this will be the last time I order from here!   Definitely wldnt recommend!!"}
{"text":"The Food is very good and affordable.  They have a decent variety to choose from although it is primarily Italian food.  They stay open until 10 most nights so that is a plus also.  With very few non chain restaurants offering delivery they rank pretty high as far as local owned businesses go.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  It is not a fancy place nor is it a big place!  The pizza's, subs, spaghetti and fries are great!!"}
