{"text":"The ice cream is amazing. It is the only vegan ice cream I've had that wasn't icy or watery-- it was creamy, rich, and absolutely delicious. The only downside is the price, using cashews and almonds makes for the fantastic flavour, but it does raise the price (it was about $5CAD for a single scoop). However, I think you get what you pay for, which is quality. I will say that I was not that impressed by their chocolate ice cream, but their cookie dough, oh my goodness THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. Best cookie dough ice cream I've ever had ever. Vegan or dairy.
The staff was very friendly and the venue has a cute, retro, space-aged vibe.
I haven't tried anything from their main menu, but I'd definitely be willing to go back and try it again."}
{"text":"3 of us went to their new years even prix fixe dinner. We were very disappointed. 
The appetizer was crackers and pate. the crackers were all out of a box, rice crackers, tortilla chips. the nut pate was quite bland but not awful. I think if they had made the pate half the size and added a homemade vegan spreadable cheese then this would have been a better experience. The entree was the real disappointment. They offered beef bourguignon. This dish was over 80% just white rice with no flavoring to it. no spices, herbs or sauces- bland, bland, bland . The mock beef itself also had no spicing or flavoring to it and was very bland and there was only a tiny amount of it. For veggies they had exactly 3 green beans on each place and one small broccilli sprig. This dish would have been more tasty and healthful if they had cut the rice down by at least half, flavored it and tripled they amount of green veggies, and made a vegan protein with some flavor to it. for $30 you expect to eat more than bland white rice for your entree. The desserts were both very good and that is what the two stars are from . I think that this restaurant specializes in desserts and that is what you should go there for. They also offer lots of commercial vegan candy for takeaway. 

Maybe their lunch, brunch food is better though. I have not tried this. They did serve us quickly and the servers were nice."}
{"text":"Appetizers were good (got the dorito-tofu and the mac and cheese balls), as were the desserts, but the service was less than great. The waitresses were nice, but there were only two and it seemed like that wasn't enough for the large amount of guests on a weekend-night. I'd recommend it for the treats, but I don't think I'll be coming back for a sit down meal."}
{"text":"Had the creamy vanilla ice cream and was pleasantly surprised by how smooth the texture is considering its vegan and not made with any dairy products. It has a subtle cashew taste that balances pretty well with the vanilla flavour. Great alternative to those who can't take dairy or are vegan. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service. Forgetful wait staff. Missed orders

The bill was incorrect and was split in an overly complicated way, even after we asked for one bill, to simplify things. To top it off, an 18% gratuity was added, when none of us wanted to tip at all

The food was decent, but nowhere near worth enduring this experience"}
{"text":"Wow! Super delicious ice cream!! I had a scoop of death by chocolate and cookies n' cream.  Very creamy  but I didn't get any cookie dough bits in my scoop...I don't know if there was supposed to be lol but hands down death by chocolate was crazy good!!!"}
{"text":"Best ice cream on the planet - I think they have ruined me for other ice cream. Incredible flavors, too! I went most recently for my birthday and got the ice cream apocalypse - 6 scoops of ice cream and a bunch of awesome toppings. Among the ice cream flavors were eggnog, earl grey chocolate, and cake chunks. The food I've tried (lentil stew, lasagne) were both amazing and flavorful as well - this is food you both want to savor and inhale at the same time."}
{"text":"Looooved my experience so much that I might go back on this brief visit to Toronto :) I had the french onion soup (even though it was at least 30C outside, haha - it was so worth it!! And rum raisin ice cream? Cashew based? Omg! It did not disappoint.
And, to ammend this review after reading others, the service was great - friendly and fast . Any possible smell of weed has no bearing on the restaurant - they can't control their neighbours, and that didn't strike me as relevant at all"}
{"text":"Love this place. The mac and cheese balls are addictive. How are plain french fries so good. Only wish they had the tacos all week long and all year round. Hard not to like an ice cream sandwich where you can choose your flavour of ice cream and your flavour of cookie. 

Love that since everything is vegan I can just choose from the menu without having to ask any questions to be sure."}
{"text":"If you're seeking vegan ice cream or vegan food, this is the place for you...look no further. I read other yelp reviews in search of vegan ice cream and decided to check this place out. Upon arrival I decided to get the Chicken Pot Pie and my brother ordered the Mac and Cheese Balls. Both plates were delicious! We finished out meal off with a combination of Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough and Berry Cheesecake ice cream. 1. I am a vegan ice cream connoisseur 2. The ice cream was creamy and perfectly churned 3. I don't like cheesecake, but that berry cheesecake flavor was like a holiday!! Lastly, the staff was friendly, attentive, and kind. 

So, if you want great vegan food and/or ice cream...stop what you're doing and make your way on over! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"While in Toronto for a short vacation, we went to Cosmic Treats three times. Three times!  Everything we had was wonderful - the sausage & peppers sandwich, the \"chicken\" pot pie, the soups, the Dorito-encrusted tofu, the root vegetable fries, the baked desserts, and the cashew ice cream (which they make themselves and is creamier and richer than any dairy-based ice cream I've had).  The staff and owners were so nice and helpful, and we loved the place.  We'll definitely find ourselves back there the next time we go to Toronto."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to have a full meal here! My only wish is really that I'd saved enough room for some ice cream.

Service is really great; they are staffed by endearingly quirky people who are genuinely friendly and helpful. It feels like a great team of people, and the atmosphere benefits from this. 
I ordered the breakfast - it wasn't anything too spectacular, tofu scramble was a little too heavy on the turmeric but the pancakes were nice. My partner had the chicken pot pie; the crust was to DIE for. Overall, their diner style food is totally fine, not bad, not excellent, but filling and creative. 

THE DESSERTS THOUGH. We split a brownie and the PB choco cheesecake. Real good. Texture, flavour, portions all on point. I definitely recommend saving room or just coming here for the sweets. I look forward to trying more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends while walking around Kensington Market, in search of a cold treat. The first notable trait about this place to me was its service - the waiters and waitresses were extremely friendly and helpful. They recommended other places we could go to in the area, and were really accommodating while we were uninformed of the place's vegan nature. I ended up getting their mango soy froyo, while my friend got the mint chocolate chip milkshake. Both tasted amazing - we couldn't tell it was vegan. The prices were also very well-priced, considering how most vegan places are quite expensive. Overall, a great stop in Kensington market for vegan food!"}
{"text":"Must surely be Toronto's premier vegan dessert place. Their ice-cream pie and cheesecake are out of this world. Nothing else like this place that I know of. Looking forward to returning to try their regular food offerings -- all vegan as well. The sky is the limit for this destination."}
{"text":"Amazing. Phenomenal. These are the superlatives I have chosen in order to rate my satisfaction of Cosmic Treats. 

Where to start? Wait staff was kind and courteous. The owner even made a brief introduction to our table. He seemed really genuine and sweet. 
As for the food? So tasty. Not a vegan,but this place suited both mine and my sis's needs for some delicious food. I got the cheese sticks (a good dish for those of you who like a little spice in your life) and a sundae ( we are talking about a 2 scooper with oreo birthday cake and cookie dough ice cream topped with mint Oreo cookies and rich butterscotch sauce). My sis had the peppers and sausage sammie with a beautiful side salad. She also noted that the dressing was delicious ! 

All in all, a delightful time was had. This food is outta this  world (pun intended)"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch using Foodora. I ordered the Chick'n Pot Pie with a market salad on a side, and a Banana Chocolate Chip Sour Cream Cake. Overall, I was pleased with my order. This is a restaurant I'd try again. I gave 4/5 stars for the great pot pie. I wish the price was cheaper though but it's understandable since most vegan restaurants have this price point. See details on the food below!

Chick'n Pot Pie = 4/5 
I really enjoyed this one. When it arrived, it was a bit warm, which is expected since it was delivery. I bet if I had this in the restaurant it would have been hot, comforting, and perfect. It had potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, red bell pepper, beans, peas, and a nice crust. I wish it had more chick'n though. The salad had spinach, shredded beets, red bell pepper, tomatoes, cucumbers, and balsamic vinaigrette. It was definitely filling and I'd order it again.

Banana Chocolate Chip Sour Cream Cake = 2.5/5
This was a fancier banana bread. The size reminds me of those school safe banana bread snacks you can get from Costco. It basically tastes like that - sweet. I was disappointed with this one since I found it pricey for what reminded me of a school snack. I thought it would be a slice of cake, but it looks just like that snack. I wouldn't repurchase this again. Definitely try a different dessert."}
{"text":"meh, ok. I was excited by all the gluten free items the menu offers, but they actually didn't have any of it, not even the gluten-free ice cream cones. Our server seemed very uninformed about what they did have and needed a lot of awkward encouragement to get us the correct information."}
{"text":"The vegan ice cream here is amazing!  It is really expensive ($8 for a large waffle cone), but for someone who hasn't had ice cream for 5 years due to lactose intolerance, the price is worth it.  I'll note though, that the scoop was very large, and I gave half to a friend because I couldn't finish it.  I tried the maple and cookies and cream flavours, and would definitely recommend the maple!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day for the Veggielicious event with a friend but decided not to because what we wanted to order was cheaper than the price packaged deal... Lol we were greeted almost immediately, handed a menu and water. 

While looking over the menu, what caught our eyes was the Dorito covered tofus. That actually turned out good with  a good squeeze of lime over it. Not too fond of the sauce that came with it though because it was too much flavour overpowering what is already good. We also ordered a lasagna and omg.....it was terrible. I took one bite out of it and it left a really bitter/sour after taste almost as if dish soap was mixed in there, we dug around the lasagna and figured out it was the tomatoes! It just tasted terrible and bland. I'm not vegan but I've had vegetarian /vegan food many many many times in my life and never have I ever tasted anythingso bad.  I truly lost my appetite after taking a bite out of the lasagna. There was also a couple next to us who also gave us an idea that the food was not good either , I'm more than sure they came for the Veggielicious event as well and what this place offered Sloppy Joes as a main dish and tbh it looked like puke and probably tasted like it too. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you MAYBE want dessert.."}
{"text":"Fun place! I like the retro motif. Kind of like the Jetsons. Super friendly owner Eliot greeted us and gave us samples tastes of the the delicious cashew ice cream. We tried the chocolate peanut butter ice cream pie with Rice Krispie crust. We also had a banana split, a moist cinnamon bun and a \"blizzard\" (don't judge, there were 4 of us!) Everything was delicious! Can't wait to come back and try their food menu."}
{"text":"From reading past reviews, the chicken pot pie used to be around $12 and now it's $15....definitely not worth the price at all. When I order food at restaurants, I typically try to choose items off the menu that would be too much of a hassle to make at home, something I wouldn't have the time or energy to make myself...so I chose the chicken pot pie. But as I found out, I would have definitely been able to make a better version at home. The pie was filled with mock chicken (tasted like rubber), chunks of sweet potato, etc. - it was super small, bland, mediocre and lacking any flavor whatsoever. It was just sad. For the side I got the lentil soup because it was cold as fuck out and honestly, that was even sadder...it tasted weird and tangy and had an unpleasant texture. It felt like I was eating baby food.

I also ordered the Far From Pedestrian Sunday and chose the cookie dough and salted caramel flavors. Two stars for it. It was delicious. Just so creamy and dreamy. Although I did start to feel a little bit sick after a couple of scoops of the salted caramel (it's REALLY salty!). 

Overall, the food here is seriously shit. If you're going to come here, don't get any of the mains or anything. Just come for dessert. You won't get any service after you order your food anyways."}
{"text":"Had the cupcake sundae with cookies and cream icecream. Absolutely delicious! Couldn't tell it was vegan. Service was great too, staff seem very fun. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"One of my go-to vegan spots in the city. The icecream is amazing, some of the best I've ever had (vegan and non-vegan included!). The staff is super friendly. They have a large range of sweets to choose from but also have a menu with food. They have comfort foods like mac and cheese balls and have amazing brunch items like banana pancakes w/ peanut butter, marshmallow fluff, chocolate drizzel, coconut whipped cream & a scoop of icecream. They stick to a theme with their decor which is cute. 

Overall, this is a place I go to over and over again because of the good (and creative) food, friendly staff, and the clean and nicely decorated environment."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot! We only went for the baked goods and not for food but their food looked and smelled delicious! I want to try the chili cheese fries next time. We tried the brownie and banana bread, they tasted really amazing! The service was good and very friendly. I really liked how they give you water when you choose to eat in, I'm a thirsty person LOL"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food & ice treats! I would definitely go back and try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. I've tried this place twice and I think there's better vegan food in the city. Mac and cheese balls are okay (much, much better at Doomie's), caesar salad wrap is okay but there was hardly any chicken and the sweet chili heat tofu was pretty bland"}
{"text":"Couldn't choose between all the delicious ice cream flavours so we ordered all of them! so tasty!"}
{"text":"Courteous staff. We tried the peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake, berry cheesecake, cinnamon roll, jammer cookie, chocolate mousse cake. All delicious. Definitely recommend coming to this vegan treats shop! The shop also offers plant based savory comfort dishes that smell mouth-watering."}
{"text":"Kind and tentative service paired with pretty awesome food. I had the sampler trio with Mac and cheese balls, moz sticks and jalapeño poppers. Flavours were just like their nonvegan counterparts but the portion was quite small for the 10 dollar price tag. I sampled their ice cream and it was rich, creamy and flavourful. 
Would return but would dislike the steep price."}
{"text":"Best place to go for dessert in Toronto. Also some really damn decent brunch, lunch, and dinner foods. Everything is vegan BUT even if you are not vegan you will LOVE IT. Here's the best thing I've experience: me and my boyfriend shared the Ice Cream Apocalypse. Here's what it includes: 

- 6 scoops of ice cream (flavors change frequently, we had chili chocolate, early grey chocolate, lavender, lemon tart, creamy vanilla, maple)
- 3 sauces (we got chocolate fudge, butter scotch, and salted caramel bourbon) 
- 4 toppings (many choices, we got crumbled cookie-brownie, peanuts, maple leaf cookie peaces, mint Oreo pieces)
- Whip cream
- Maraschino cherry

It was DELICIOUS. We couldn't finish the thing (it's very big!) and they gave as an ice-cream container to take it home. 

Go here. You will feel like your childhood dream is being fulfilled. We were giddy with joy."}
{"text":"Delicious home-cooked tasting vegan comfort food, ice cream, and drinks. Super cute decor and the owners/staff are so friendly. Their brunch is yummy and I can't wait to sample everything from the menu."}
{"text":"The staff was very helpful in accommodating a soy free diet even though the majority of their items are tofu based. Definitely try the banana chocolate chip pancakes! The"}
{"text":"We went for dessert, so we didn't get to try any of the other dishes they also offer. My friend got the chocolate chip brownie and I got a salted caramel brownie with a side of chocolate chip cookie dough cashew ice cream. 

So I'm a huge ice cream fan, and I'll never get over how cashew ice cream tastes so good! It's one of my favourites. And this place has the best that I've had. I was chatting with the man who works there and he was mentioning how they make all their ice cream in house which I think is pretty cool. The two brownies tasted great as well. Because it was super sweet, I suggest if you don't have a big sweet tooth to maybe get a cookie or just the ice cream. They also have a selection of cakes and cheesecakes if you prefer something like that. 

The service is slow, but everyone is super nice. And if you are a regular at the vegan food festival in Toronto, you will recognize some people. The vibe is great as well. Looks super funky and there are some pretty cool decorations around. The area is easy to get to and there's a lot to see if you're just in the neighbourhood. 

There is a shelter close by and we were approached by a woman asking us to buy her food. I thought I would since I usually do if someone is asking for something to eat. She was asking for a salad so I bought her one. I believe she comes in often because the man working there donated the juice for her as well. I'm mentioning this because the worker handled it very well and to know that because there is a shelter down the street it might happen when you're there!"}
{"text":"Came here today because my friend never shuts up about this place! 

This is a super chill vegan dessert place with many food options too. I got to try the mac & cheese balls and those were super great. But the best is probably my berry blast milkshake with soy milk!!! 

The menu seemed reasonable priced. We ordered take-out and we did not wait too long for our order. 

The service here is amazing, the staff were very friendly and suggested many great options. And there are also all-gender washrooms!

Definitely check out this cute little place when you're around the Kensington area!!"}
{"text":"Great vegan restaurant. The sausage and pepper sandwich was really tasty, but the Mac n cheese balls might be the best thing I've ever eaten! The boozy milkshake was also supreme.  Small restaurant but didn't feel crowded."}
{"text":"This is definitely not my kinda place. I had a cheese and veggie lasagna. Honestly the worst lasagna of my life. The cheese was awful, the whole thing was just a sad imitation of lasagna and I've had veggie lasagna before that was amazing. If this was my first time having vegan food I would never want to try it again. The service was friendly but the entire menu was disappointing and nothing I tried tasted good (french onion soup was also a pale imitation and the fried tofu was only good because of the bbq sauce).

I didn't bother with dessert after all the unappetizing food we had."}
{"text":"Vegan  food can be a hit or miss!  I ordered some mac & cheese balls and chicken pot pie and some sort of tofu square.... I got delivery so I don't know what the ambiance would have been like! I enjoyed the mac n cheese balls the most!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by \"vegan gains\" so I had to check it out.

I ordered two scoops of waffle cone ice cream: chocolate and cookie dough. Chocolate flavor is classic and you can't go wrong with that. Cookie dough is very creamy and I recommend it if you like Oreos.

Honestly this is the best vegan ice cream I ever had. And I have pretty much tried them all. Super friendly staff even though I walked in during closing time. I'm a huge fan of the place and I'm surely coming back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"More yummy treats in the market. Now in addition to the frozen vegan options at Sweet Olenka's and Hibiscus, there's this entirely vegan ice-cream parlour, bakery, snack bar, candy bar and straight up bar with a front patio in the space that used to be Aspetta. 

We got two milkshakes - one cookies n' cream, the other a mix of cookie dough and Turkish coffee. It was hard to tell them apart flavour-wise, and most of the chunks had been liquified but it was tasty regardless. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dessert stop with a friend. Service was a bit slow given there was only one server/cashier. However the food did make up for it! I got the birthday cake ice cream and they also had cinnamon rolls. The server was nice enough to throw in an extra for free. The ice cream wasn't overly sweet and very creamy, but I personally prefer coconut based ice creams. They do give generous portions with their ice cream though. Their small scoop is easily shareable. The cinnamon roll was amazing, it was a nice bread-y consistency and wasn't too heavy as some cinnamon rolls are. 

Definitely give this place a try. I will have to come back one day to try their savoury offerings!"}
{"text":"I came here because a friend posted about this place and on this day before a networking event, I had some time to spare, so I stopped by for a treat!

Everything at Cosmic Treats is vegan. The manager Alexis is absolutely lovely and she makes all the ice cream, which is all cashew-based. All the baked goods are also vegan, and made in-house. 

Don't let the name fool you, Cosmic Treats doesn't just offer treats, they also offer full vegan meals. When you look at the menu, you'll see menu items that you see at a pub or restaurant, but all vegan! Like mac and cheese balls, or jalapeños poppers, or even an all day breakfast menu. Yeah, all day vegan brekkie! On the weekends, they have a different menu to offer brunch.

Cosmic Treats is fully licensed, so they have a selection of beers, wines and a selection of bar alcohols so they can concoct a mix with your favourite vegan ice cream.

They also have a patio area and with the garage door opened, Cosmic Treats is going to be a hopping place for the summer. While I'm not vegan, Cosmic Treats might just be one to convert me."}
{"text":"Okay to start: Their desserts are AMAZING so so good. So many ice cream flavours and cookies and cupcakes. I had the cupcake sundae and was in heaven.

However, their breakfast was a bit disappointing. I brought my non-vegan but anaphylactic-to-dairy friend with me and we were super excited to try the breakfast with tofu scramble.

I ordered the scramble with blueberry pancakes, and she got hers with waffles. The waitress said not everyone loves the pancakes because of the oats? i think it was. But I have made some vegan pancakes at home that I've loved. When the food came out, I understood why she didn't recommend the pancakes. The actual taste of them was really nice so it wasn't a recipe issue, but the middle was totally uncooked. I could only eat the edges!  My friend wasnt complaining about the waffles. The tofu scramble also disappointed us both a bit. Yeah she's used to eggs, but I've made more flavourful tofu scramble at home. It was pretty dry and with very minimal spices. They could've pumped up the spice a bit and maybe used less firm tofu. 

Still, those desserts are so good that I adore this place. I'd be willing to try their Doritos encrusted tofu next time as well ;)"}
{"text":"best vegan ice cream i have ever had. toasted marshmallow til i die.
and nathaniel,my server) was an absolute rockstar!!  
i give him 10 (out of 5) stars"}
{"text":"Cosmic Treats is what my vegan food dreams are made of.

I ordered the southern breaded tofu + root vegetables. Oh. My. Gosh. I've always been wary of ordering tofu in restaurants because it feels very hit or miss (based on my relatively limited experience). This meal was incredible. The tofu was cooked perfectly, the spicy BBQ sauce that came with the meal was AMAZING, and the root vegetables were delicious.

For dessert, I ordered a soy milk + maple ice cream milkshake. Again - insanely delicious. I can't even handle how good it was. When I went vegan I was pretty concerned about whether I'd miss milkshakes, ice cream, dairy dessert things. Cosmic Treats has reassured me that I will never miss those things again. Not to mention - the milkshake came in a massive metal 'mixer' that contained enough to re-fill my Old Style milkshake glass about 3.5 times. Insane.

The service was fantastic - so friendly, prompt and fun. Cool decor; very casual - I love that they also have vegan candy for sale at the cash register, along with baked goods and more ice cream."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto over the past week and found another new favorite vegan place!  Cosmic Treats has a menu that is creative, fun, and exciting!  Some favorites include Tofu encrusted with Sweet Chili Doritos, Birthday Cake Ice Cream, Cookie Brownie Bars, Fried Cheese Sticks, and so much more.   I went there three times this past Saturday alone and several times over the past week as I simply could not get enough of it.  Coming from Hawaii and not having many vegan options, this place was a dream come true.  I also met both of the owners who were lovely!  Thanks Cosmic Treats!  Can't wait to come back to Toronto!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed after seeing all these amazing reviews.. I came here to eat my feelings in vegan food today and I was not impressed.

We sat on the patio. Sat at around 6pm, it was warm and the weather was 20+ so why not? Bad choice. It's expected but the smell of weed from all the passerbys could've made me get second-hand high. Service was good for the first 5 minutes, we were given our drinks and menus almost immediately. I was pleased to find the extensive menu but even though I wanted to eat everything, I did not have much of an appetite. I was surprised to see stuff like dorito tofu though. I ended up ordering the peanut and tofu salad after finding out that they ran out of chicken pot pie. Bummer. Flagging down the server took 20 minutes because nobody was coming our way and there were a bunch of customers standing, blocking the line of view to our table. I was getting hangry. 

When we finally put our orders in, we watched the people of the street stroll by. From old ladies smoking a joint, to young hipsters, we saw it all. We even saw 2 cars being towed. All of this was not adding well into my hunger. Where was our food? Literally 3 tables had sat down and got their food and LEFT before we had contact with a server. Our water ran out after 20 minutes and there was no refill. The lady finally rushed over at 6:50 (yes, that's almost a damn hour) and told us it would be out in a few minutes. I was so hangry at this point that I just wanted to leave, but I knew I had to be carbed up if I wanted to continue living. 

OUR FOOD FINALLY CAME OUT AT 7:15PM. By that time, we were cold and unhappy. The food was mediocre and I don't understand why it took over an hour to put together some lettuce, carrot shreds, peanut sauce and panfry some tofu. I make the same dish in 10 minutes. My friend that ordered the dorito tofu.. it was interesting but.. :/ it was dry and unappetizing after the second one.

I feel like most people that like this place are non-vegans because of the hype of vegan food. For somebody who eats several meals of vegan food everyday, I left this place thinking 'never again'."}
{"text":"Went to Cosmic Treats yesterday afternoon for the first time. As soon as I walked in it really felt \"cosmic\" with the awesome wall art that make you feel like you're in a spaceship and the futuristic-looking light fixtures. The atmosphere was great! I'd have to admit the slanted glasses tripped me out of a bit, haha! I ordered the lasagna main dish that comes with a side of salad. It was SO good! The best lasagna I have ever had, I'd recommend it to everyone! Decided to get a treat after and went with the birthday cake ice cream. It was my first time trying cashew milk based ice cream and boy was it delicious! Also, the staff is super friendly and welcoming. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I love that they had vegan froyo! It's made like yogen-fruz (with incorporated frozen fruit). There were many vegan baked goods, and ice cream as well!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried food from the regular menu, but I had a cupcake sundae and it was the yummiest dessert I've ever had. And I'm not even vegan! Our server was also friendly and prompt. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Cosmic Treats is an all vegan spot here in Kensington Market. They have a cute little space with desserts like pies, cupcakes, ice cream cones and ice cream. We were up for something sweet so we decided on a slice of pumpkin pie, which was really delicious. The pie itself was smooth, creamy, and had a great flavor. My only complaint is that the price is pretty steep, it was over 5 dollars and the slice was pretty small. For that price I would expect a bigger slice. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the taste."}
{"text":"All vegan spot. Great atmosphere and amazing customer service. 

A decent amount of selection on the menu, ice cream made from cashew milk, and pastries.  A bit pricey for the amount of food we received. 

1. Chicken pot pie with vegetable root fries $12.75: Pot pie was okay, freshly made. Flaky crust and good amount of filling. I felt it was overpowering in the pepper and lacked other spices. The fries was very good, sweet potato and Yukon gold potato. Thick cut and  very sweet. 

2. All day breakfast with waffles $12.25: Tofu scramble with roasted potatoes and half of a waffle. The tofu was bland, just the yellow coloring. Roasted  potatoes were flavourful with enough seasoning. The waffles were good, thick and fluffy. Wasn't gritty. 

Overall, great service, good food section with desserts. Decent portion. In a great neighborhood."}
{"text":"Omg if this would have been the first vegan restaurant i tried, I would have hated Vegan food forever.
We got lunch at the office from here, I asked for pasta and meat balls.
Oh what a terrible mistake, there was no flavor what so ever, the sauce yuck taste like it was just put straigth from the can or bottle, meat balls no flavor, i could only taste the spices. 
Some people got the sandwich and potpie, people agreed this restaurant was a bad choice.
I think the side salad was edible. Really Sad!
We should have oredered from Grasshopper!"}
{"text":"Group of 5 came here on our Kensington Market journey.  Cosmic Treat was the 2nd stop on our agenda.  This place focuses on Vegan made meals, though the title, Cosmic Treat sounds more of a confectionery we decided to give this place a try.
Upon entering, the atmosphere is chilled out with ample seating along with patio seating available in the summer months.
If driving down here, parking can be a challenge, however nonetheless its worth trying once.
As for food, we all kept it light with appetizers to share:
*Vegan Mac and Cheese balls - probably the best choice
*Vegan jalapeno poppers - had a slight kick but would have preferred hotter.
*Cheese sticks - good choice.

Maybe its my pallet, but I found the cheese strange, I guess because its vegan-ized cheese :) 

As for desserts we had the opportunity to try their vegan brownie and peanut butter bar. Both were extremely decadent - which really saves this review LOL!!! 
I'd personally come back for the desserts and the food. (being non-vegan)"}
{"text":"We will go back - food is very filling and tasty (read NOT bland). My husband got the sausage sandwich, and gazpacho (which is perfect in this heat!) I had the tofu salad. The ice cream is very satisfying and the flavors are amazing. Definitely kid friendly."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great vegan option but I cannot say that I will return. The food is good but I found it to be very overly salty and a little lacklustre. The service was good but the restaurant was very busy and I felt a little rushed. Overall, the experience was good but I was not wowed."}
{"text":"Vegan cupcakes?  Is this such a thing???

Nestled in kensington market, this cozy vegan cafe is a nice cozy departure from the hubhub of the busy market.  Offering a nice spacious place to relax after navigating the eclecticness of the market.

Now, onto the cupcake itself.  They are stored in a fridge and i was bracing for a cold and dense chocolate cupcake...

What i got was a soft, chewy cupcake that melted in my mouth.  Definately recommend!"}
{"text":"Kensington Market has a ton of unique food options for anyone looking for a meal, snack, or a sweet treat. Cosmic Treats manages to offer delicious options for anyone looking for any of those things. I made my second ever trip to Cosmic Treats on Saturday while showing some American friends around the city. Originally we just planned on getting a quick treat here, once my friends saw all the options on the menu we ended up grabbing a table and ordering some food. I ended up giving the Southern Fried Tofu a try and it was a decision neither my mouth or stomach regretted. The food didn't take all that long to come out and when it was finally served, it was worth whatever wait there was. The potatoes were little, well seasoned, and tasty while the southern fried tofu was soft, crunchy, and tasted great all at the same time. Not only was I pleased with my meal, but my 3 friends all enjoyed theirs as well. Sadly, I was not able to try any of the dessert options this trip but I've had some of the ice cream in the past and it was delicious as well. I highly recommend this place to vegan's and non-vegan's alike, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice, and most of what I ordered (and tasted off friends' plates) was just not good. To be fair, I didn't try any ice cream or other desserts, which seems to be what they're known for - but if you can't offer other food that's good, please just be a dessert place!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Food & staff super awesome 5 stars all the way. Been to many vegan restaurants & bakeries but cosmic definitely perfected there recipes!!!"}
{"text":"Ah take out just as good as in person!

Pot pie, lentil soup, Sweet Chili Heat Doritos encrusted tofu, fries, huevos rancheros and cupcakes!"}
{"text":"Cosmic Treats is a fun new addition to Kensington Market, with a retro diner feel and familiar comfort food menu options. 


DECOR: Minimal, but it's still new.. White walls, orange seating and orange lamps, and some outerspace posters. Could use a bit more funk but that's just me. Loved that there was an outdoor patio which will be great in the summer, especially since they serve homemade ice cream. 

STAFF: Friendly and knowledgable. Food came quickly.


FOOD: I loved that this menu isn't your average seeds 'n lettuce vegan menu, and it doesn't shy away from using gluten. There are salads and fresh dishes of course, but there's alot of familiar classics which will certainly appeal to those non-vegs like myself.
1) Cheese poppers: Daiya (brand of vegan cheese) in a panko crust. Gooey and sinful and MMM. 
2) Root vegetable fries with aioli: Can't ever go wrong here. Generous serving size and the aioli had a great level of spice.
3) Sausage & pepper sandwich: The italian sausage was tofurky (i'm pretty sure) and it was smothered in sauteed onions and a delicious marina sauce. It was incredibly filling and I barely registered that I was eating tofu. 
4) Tofu barbecued in sweet chili heat Doritos: I don't know how else to describe this other than \"hallelujah, i have found a tofu dish that actually has personality\". 
5) Cupcake sundae: Vanilla soft serve in between a chocolate cupcake, with our choice of sprinkles, marshmalllows, and chocolate topping. The softserve was a little too soft for the cupcake, I'd pick a different flavour next time. But the cupcake was rich and the ice cream itself was sweet and refreshing. We sampled a few of the other flavours too, and they had a really good consistency thanks to their cashew base. 


OVERALL: I really enjoyed everything I tried at Cosmic Treats and I'm definitely going to return with non-vegan friends because this menu of comfort foods, milkshakes, and ice cream is sure to appeal to anyone."}
{"text":"Service was great, no complaints there. I've been trying to try out various vegan places since going vegan recently this January. 

The food that I ordered sucked. I got the lasagna and it had the most unfortunate spice in it and I could only eat it if I doused it completely in the hot sauce. My friend got the cheese sticks and those were really good. We both got some plain ice cream and we both found it to be sub par and overwhelmingly sweet. I've never had such sweet ice cream in my life. It didn't feel very refreshing. I don't think I'd ever go there again as the lasagna and cheese sticks were the only things I felt I really even wanted to try because the rest of the menu sounded unappetizing. Hogtown vegan far exceeds this place in terms of food. 

Really, don't order the lasagna."}
{"text":"Venue - patio only seats about 12, but we were lucky enough to grab a spot Friday evening. Inside has a couple small tables. 

Food - For snacks we got the Dorito crusted tofu, and mixed root vegetable fries. The tofu was tasty and the fries were pretty good, although I was expecting more unconventional root vegetables to be used (ie. Beet, taro, etc). (Those Terra chips set the standard..lol) 

For dessert we got sundaes - all the ice creams here are unique in that they are one of the only vendors I know that offer a selection of cashew based vegan ice cream. The texture was very smooth and rich;  the lemon tart was really good (I don't even like lemon ice cream and this one blew me away), and so was the cookies and cream (they also had cookie dough, vanilla and chocolate flavours). 

I did find it a bit odd that the sundaes were served in a tall milkshake cup, vs a boat or cup, but next time I will maybe ask for that. 

Service - awesome service, so sweet and accommodating! 

Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Probably my third time visiting Cosmic Treats but this time was definitely the last. My friend, who is a vegan, purchased dessert. We were asked if we would like to dine in or take the treats to go, however, we said we would take it to go, however, since we had purchased food at another restaurant and wanted to sit down and enjoy our meals and dessert, I went back to the server and asked her if we could eat our food outside. She said yes. While we were eating our food, minding our business, a loud voice beside me said, \"DID YOU GUYS BUY ANYTHING?\" Shocked, we answered yes and explained. I wasn't sure who the person was, but answered yes and the person acknowledged and sat down to eat their food. While we were eating, I still felt a cold glare and felt a sinister vibe from the unknown person but decided to pay them no attention, as I was unaware as to why they were truly so upset with us. Said person went inside only to come back out maybe 10 minutes later and tell us that he is the manager and that we need to pack our things and go. I do not remember everything he said mostly because I was honestly shocked at how this was the second time he was speaking to us in such a hostile and demeaning way. He told us that our food wasn't vegan and that he does not allow  food that has been purchased elsewhere. I asked him if he told his staff that due to the fact she had told me it was okay to eat our food. He said yes. However, this was not the end. He then proceeded to tell us that we were \"sitting there obnoxiously\" eating meat at a vegan restaurant. However, my friend who is vegan, was obviously eating a vegan, cruelty free meal. I, who am not vegan, was eating a meal that contained meat. Honestly, if his demeanour and attitude had been different, he would've received a genuine apology because it was not my intention to disrespect the business or the vegan lifestyle. I have a few vegan friends but I am not involved in their lifestyle and do not know much about it. It was very hurtful and shocking for a MANAGER to approach and berate two women, who not only remained very calm but also respectfully obliged to his commands. While he continued to slander us, we could see that he was shaking with anger, and it was very unsettling and at one point a bit frightening, mainly because neither of us had snapped and were calmly speaking to him. At one point, I found him very aggressive and told him to go back inside because it seemed his goal was solely to go on a hate-driven tirade and to get a reaction out of us, so that he could potentially escalate. I don't remember much of what he said but what I received and the words he verbally affirmed were:  regardless of our support of his business, we were not welcome and that apparently we were obnoxious and disgusting. I will NEVER go back to Cosmic Treats and I will make sure that the people I do know who are frequent buyers of their goods definitely do not support a business that claims to want the best for people but treat people as if they are unwelcome and most of all defames the character of those they do not know. Really hoping that this manager receives proper business training and mental health support that his behaviour demonstrates a serious need for.  Support businesses that take the time to educate and do not disparage customers! 

sorry for the essay, at first decided not to write anything about what happened but later voided that lol."}
{"text":"Oh thank goodness... Everything's vegan and my daughter was thrilled!  She went with a Canadian .maple milkshake to go.  Loved it!  Staff very young and helpful."}
{"text":"I can't eat dairy so vegan desserts are always a nice  treat. I ordered the chocolate mousse cake and it was chocolately smooth deliciousness. So rich and so good! A little pricey but try it out!"}
{"text":"Not even remotely healthy, but that aside, I really like it here.  Fast friendly service, interesting food, great treatment of tofu.  Comfort food for sure."}
{"text":"I visited this place with a friend was greeted by a staff  member who  recommend a caramel brownie after giving us the menu.  When my friend and I decided to order something to go the cashier lady didn't take our order and asked us to have a seat that someone else would come help us I was a bit confused as I wanted a brownie to go!! Didn't think I would have to wait more then 10min to not even be acknowledged.  We ended up leaving and the second we got up the girl came and took the menus away not a care in the world."}
{"text":"The banana split is *definitely* to be shared by at least two people, if not three! If you can't decide on your allotted amount of toppings, sometimes they'll be nice and do a bit of each. I looooove the decor and wish I could play with the light fixtures all day/night!  Ooooh! and the fondue!!!  O.k., you get the point now, I love this place!"}
{"text":"At this point will always hold this spot close to my heart as it was the first vegan spot that I came to while in Canada!! 

One of the coolest vibes/decorations in a restaurant and even the area it's in is very holistic, raw, and real (to say the least). The first thing that caught my eye was walking up to the front and seeing the sign out front that plainly has VEGAN written in huge letters (kudos!). 

The second neat thing had of been the small \"fine print\" that they had on the front of their menus about even though the food may say it contains meat it's all imaginary (I got a good laugh out of that. 

My girlfriend and I went a little crazy and ordered the following: All day breakfast, chicken pot pie (not chickens were harmed in making this), cheese sticks, and Mac n cheese balls. As much as we tried to finish all of this we couldn't. I personally got the chicken pot pie for myself (with a side of the jalapeño poppers) and it was outstanding! Full of flavor, the \"meat\" in it looks so real and the crust was perfect (not to much and not to little). Overall I was very happy with my choice! My girlfriends scramble was amazing, the flavoring they add is out of this world (no pun intended) and the sautéed spinach they add is a good finisher. As for the two appetizers if I had to pick I'd say the cheese sticks were my favorite, they were vey tasty. 

Overall I would highly recommend this spot to anyone that's in the area and doesn't want to the hassle of altering their plates to be vegan since it's all vegan! Plus they have amazing desserts (cheesecake specially); sadly we were to full to try but it looked mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"Got some cashew based ice cream here. I got a regular size of the flavors latte and Canadian maple. It was pretty smooth but still a bit grainy in texture and a bit crystallized."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. The Mac and cheese balls and the sausage and peppers are to die for. And I'm not even fully vegan. They have something for everyone. For dessert we enjoyed the chocolate chip cookie dough cashew icecream and a Nanaimo bar. Also fantastic. 
The service was friendly and accommodating, and made our out of town experience **out of this world**. Yay cosmic treats!"}
{"text":"The yoghurts were definitely low in calories, however also tasteless...
Healthy can be tasty too. This was not the case unfortunately.

Also, my friend was given ice cream with a dirty testing spoon (meaning that this dirty spoon was first inserted into container full of ice cream waiting to be served to unsuspecting customers).

On the positive note, staff was friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Had quite a high expectation coming in based on all the positive review and was really disappointed. Ordered chicken pot pie with root vegetables, the pie was decent, not flaky but quite fragrant. But the filling lack in flavour and was too runny. Only found one piece of chik'n. The root vegetable fries taste like every other fries. Had a taste of friends Doritos tofu, totally lack in flavour. Worst part - service. The server forgot my friends soup until we asked him. And instead of giving my friend the soup, he first started to learn how to put the order in the POS system. So my friend ended up getting her soup after we both finish the main dish. Never once did the servers come to ask how the food was, and never check to take away the dish after we finished. Had a sample of a few of their ice creams, again, lack in flavour, not creamy at all. Overall, mediocre food with very disappointing service."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! The service was kind and prompt. Elliot (the owner) was very warm and present. We did go when there were only 3 other tables though, so I can't speak to their speediness during a busy time.

The offerings are delicious with a good variety. I loved the ice cream especially - so creamy, sweet, and satisfying. We tried the cheese sticks which were huge, spicy, and had excellent mouthfeel. The pepper sausage sandwich was huge too - over 12 inches long with savoury marinara and crunchy peppers.  My sister had a sundae and it was honestly the best she's ever had.

Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Came here to have dessert after tacos at Seven Lives because I've never tried cashew based ice cream (I'm not vegan) and reviews were good. I sampled two flavours and ended up going with a scoop of Bahama Mama (coconut, mango, and ..vanilla? Or pineapple?).
It was definitely creamier than expected for a non-dairy ice cream! I really liked it more than I thought I would in comparison to coconut milk based ice cream. I couldn't really taste the cashew until near the end of the ice cream but even then it was pretty subtle."}
{"text":"lasagna, rich and flavorful.
dorito encrusted tofu, great idea, delicious."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and quick at Cosmic Treats. I'm not sure if they're ever very busy because I'm always first in line when I arrive here, and don't usually see patrons hanging out. I do show up early in the mornings and afternoons, so perhaps that explains it. This is one of the many places in Kensington Market that I'm likely to stop by out of the blue.

The milkshakes are really good here. They're the reason I've come back. You can mix flavours and they're pretty cool about helping you bring together a good flavour combination. Almond milk tastes great in a milkshake so that's a plus. I've tried some of their treats as well, and they aren't lacking in taste even for a vegan spot. They're a solid little bakery off of the beaten path and are very reliable."}
{"text":"First off, the service was a bit slow to start but then was fantastic. My server was so friendly and thoughtful,  she made my day. The cashew ice creams are delicious,  I especially love the rum raisin. I went with the Doritos crusted tofu bites but felt they were bland and lacked flavor bit the sweet sauce they came with didn't suit them. I also had a sampler platter and loved the mac and cheese balls and mozzarella sticks. The jalapeno poppers were so so."}
{"text":"My all time favourite vegan place in the city! Food is amazing (both their savory stuff + their sweet stuff) and their brunch especially is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Vegan and not healthy. Most of the food is fried, processed, and greasy."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Cosmic Treats since hearing about it from a friend. At the moment it is only open on the weekends, but they promise more hours during the week. After stopping by and discovering it closed on weekdays we were glad to find it open to try it out. 

The place opened on Augusta Avenue in an abandoned store. It is always nice to see another vegan dessert place, increasing the options for vegan desserts. The place is long and narrow with a garage door that faces west on to Augusta Avenue. Spartan in design in style there is a small outdoor patio allowing the garage door to rise on nice days creating a nice flow between outside and in. The blank white walls cry out for some campy artwork or murals that explore the name and theme they are going for. There are a collection of tables with retro styled chairs and some fun death-star exploding like-lights throughout the place. The kitchen is located behind an ice cream counter featuring their daily flavours and a small collection of baked goods. I opted for their ice cream sandwich with chocolate ice cream, while my friend had a chocolate cone. The ice cream is delicious and the cookies yummy and sweet. We also tried samples of some of the other flavours which were also delicious (although I would love the strawberry to have a more strawberry flavour and maybe some pieces of strawberry in it.) 
Next time I want to try their banana split, can't remember the last time I had one of those. They also have a small collection of chocolates, which I would love to see expanded. Is it too much to ask that someone in Toronto would carry vegan dark chocolate peanut butter cups? Or for that matter, vegan chocolate eclairs? These are things I dream of.  

They also have a small selection of lunch options with a collection of sides (love the fact that a side option is gazpacho, this should be a more regular option in restaurants). The name and the selection of options positions the place as a modern take on a soda shop. I look forward to watching them as they grow and find their place in Kensington Market. I am sure we will become regular visitors."}
{"text":"OK
Started off the night at a different location but had Cosmic treats bookmarked. Since a bunch of us (5) were in the Kensington market area, we decided to check this place out. We had the jalapeño poppers, Max and cheese balls and the mozzarella sticks! Everyone was impressed. When I went to the counter to pay (I also wanted to check out the ice cream flavours) they had a cookie brownie and a peanut butter Krispy bar (I'm not sure if that's what it was called), but they were delicious. I do not have a sweet tooth but the cookie brownie was delicious and I would definitely travel all the way back just to pick one up!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm not vegan, but I'm lactose intolerant, so I am super happy that they offer amazing treats that are dairy free. 

I've been here 3 times, twice for cheesecake (tried their blueberry cheesecake and coconut mango cheesecake), and came here for brunch once. The tofu scramble was amazing, my friend didn't even realize it was tofu, not eggs! 

I got their tofu scramble with cornmeal waffle, and mixed veggie root fries! You have to pay at the counter, so it's kind of a fast casual setting."}
{"text":"My second time here and What a disappointment :( I went on a Sunday night and the place was not very busy so I figured I could pick a quick treat. I waited for a while to get the attention of the server, but it seemed like his main job was to attend to the tables. I waited a little longer and finally asked him if I could order with him. He snapped at me asking me to wait because people at the tables had been there for a while. I felt pretty shocked at how he snapped so I left.
As I mentioned this was my second \"visit\",  I had a similar bad costumer service experience the first time, but I figured maybe they are having a bad day. Avoid this places if you can."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better review because the food was quite good but the people were not. My cousin and I met up from our respected work places for our lunch breaks to grab a light bite. I wanted the lentil soup and when I said \"for here\" the girl said we could just sit down and they'd serve us from our tables. My cousin wanted hers to go because she to our time crunch she wanted to pay upfront and be able to take the rest to work if she didn't finished. I agreed and requested the same. We also got a dessert to split. Before the girl actually took our order she went to the back for a good few minutes which was super weird. We waited at the tables outside for our food and when we heard a ding we got up to get it. We brought the food outside and began to eat. The takeout containers were a good call since the portions were huge. I got the lentil soup and she got the root veg fries. Well, about 10 minutes into sitting there the girl comes up to us and goes \"oh, I thought you wanted it to go\" super weird and uncomfortable and unnecessary, especially since the place was EMPTY! She clearly was just bitter about not getting a tip but sorry, I'm not tipping on pre made soup and dessert LOL! So  rude."}
