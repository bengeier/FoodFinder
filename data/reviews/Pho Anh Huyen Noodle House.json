{"text":"#19 is probably the best bowl of soup I've ever tasted.  It's more like a Tom Yum, like you would find in a Thai place.  Been ordering it for years and it never gets tired.  Not too familiar with the other menu items but I know other people have their favourites too."}
{"text":"My partner and I came in around closing time yesterday (unbeknownst to us - we hadn't checked the hours). Our server was a bit rushed and pushy, but I assume that must have been the reason, so I can't fault him in retrospect. I ordered the beef sat√© pho and my partner ordered the egg noodle soup with chicken (I believe that's what it was called). The taste of the broth for each dish was definitely above average. Both dishes were delicious and the portions were massive, especially for the price (~$10/person). We will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing vermicelli with curry - beef, chicken & pork. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the curry chicken soup here! Great flavours, large portion and very reasonable price. The salad rolls are good too. I highly recommend this restaurant - definitely not a fancy establishment but that's fine with me!"}
{"text":"I have to say, this place is absolutely yummy! I eat here at least twice a week because it's close to work, but the proximity is just a perk. It really doesn't look like much both from the outside and the inside. But let's get things straight, it's very clean and the food is fresh and healthy. The staff are super nice, they are honest and prepare the food quite quickly. Once we paid for ice tea and they forgot to give it to us. We didn't even notice. Well two weeks later, when we went back, the guy remembered he owed us an ice tea. It's a mom and pop shop a la Vietnamese! :) Some of my favorites include...Pho Ga Sate (chicken vegetable sate noodle soup), which is great for colds! Watch out for that spice, it's sure to unplug your sinuses! I also love their Bun Ga Nuong Cha Gio (chicken and spring rolls on vermicelli) which comes with lots of veggies! So, if you want good healthy food in a hurry, head down to Pho Anh Huyen and enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"A secret pleasure.

It's easy to pass by and miss Pho An's unassuming facade on Centre Street. Yet it features one of my secret pleasures. #30 is a spicy coconut curry chicken soup. It's like a warm hug, highly addictive, it's crack in soup form. The broth is rich and creamy spiked with an intense but smooth heat, full of flavor, titillating to the senses. I can't really say anything about the other items on the menu, since this dish is so good, I just haven't tried anything else yet."}
{"text":"The food is authentic, well priced and has good portions. The restaurant is clean and inviting. My first visit to a Pho restaurant in Calgary and I've tried many in Vancouver."}
{"text":"Wonderful little noodle shop.  Have only tried the won ton soup so far but good so far.  Nice soup base that isn't too salty.  The wor won ton had a huge amount of veg.  The all pork won tons were a good size and flavour.  Wonderful egg noodles with good texture.  Definitely coming back to try some other soups on the menu."}
{"text":"My partner and I stumbled upon this little noodle house a few years back on our very first trip to Calgary and had one of the best meals we've had in all of Alberta.  On our recent return to that fair city, we sought it out again.  

The food is fantastic.  And I love that they have an extensive vegetarian menu.  I would encourage folks to stick to the soups.  They are hearty, filling, and so amazingly delicious.  On this recent trip, I had the curry soup.  Such depth of flavours!  I counted three different types of onions (white, green and fried), each adding another layer of taste to an already intricately seasoned dish.  Lots of other crisp vegetables (carrots, broccoli, etc.) and the right amount of noodles.  The fired tofu kept its texture and crunch.  

The spring rolls are exceptional.  And the milk shakes are so satisfying.

For us, no trip to Calgary is complete without a stop at this gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious food, big portions, good price! Friendly service, too.

I feel like I'm in Southeast Asia when dining here."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. The curry soups are to die for!! Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Calgary and worked nearby.  This place was amazing.  I'm vegetarian and I would always order the 58 or the 62 (the tofu curry soup).  The tofu curry soup was so good a lot of meat-eaters would opt for it.  Since leaving Calgary, I've never found anything as good.  Not even in Toronto or Ottawa.  I miss this place."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good vegetarian selection, and if you go there often enough, they remember you and smile when you walk in :). I never had to remind anyone there that I needed peanut and not fish sauce. During certain times of the day, you can watch a little old lady carefully rolling up all the spring rolls. Their veggie spring rolls are crispy and succulent, full of delicious veggies and taro root. Their coconut juice isn't overly sweet and has lots of coconut meat slices. Perfect on a hot day!"}
{"text":"I seem to crave Pho on a daily basis... is this weird? I just cannot get enough of it and I figure, it is a brothy soup - it has to be healthy enough right? So, I had an hour to kill between appointments and fighting traffic to go get my husband from work downtown. I love dining alone at times at an informal place to just say AHHHH and relax with a magazine and my thoughts as I eat. I am the type of person that once I get my meal, I kind of need 5 minutes of silence to breathe everything in, to see and taste. Too intense? Maybe but that makes me foodie-ish for sure.  So anyways, I wanted to be on or near Centre St NW and I quickly asked my hubby via phone about this place once I pulled into the parking lot. (was so glad there was parking and it was easy to find on the street, I totally picked a place at random) Hubby gave it a thumbs up from what he saw on-line so in I went. It was deadsville as it was an odd time of the day - 300pm or so. This was good as I got to talk to the owner's son and learned they had been in biz 12 years. I asked what the most popular soup was and he responded, \"Curry Soup\". Me, Janna who goes against the grain on most things ordered something else - the spicy seafood soup (had a chile printed next to it so right up my alley) and ordered no calamari but extra shrimp instead. No problems with that, so crabstick and shrimp it was. As I pondered my surroundings I thought, \"Yep, this is a hole in the wall as the others said it was on-line and the floor could use a good sweep but these places serve the best food, right?\" Hot Jasmine tea came out straight away and I was so thankful - 1 - because I love it and 2 - it was a billion degrees below zero. Brr. The server was relaxed but aimed to please and I never felt in a rush. My food came out piping hot and I took it all in at my leisure. YUM. I was told that the Mom here makes the soup and wow, I wish my mom lived close by and could cook soup like that! The rice noodles in the soup (my fave) were the perfect texture, fresh onions floated about, the seafood was plump, delectable and the broth, perfect, Just like Pho should be. It was the Large bowl, I cannot imagine what the other choice would look like, the Extra Large bowl! The meal came with lime and bean sprouts and basil. Yum! It was a good experience and a cheap one at that! Under $10 including the free tea!
I am coming back here for sure and darn it, I am going to go for that curry soup next time!! I love supporting family restaurants and this place being open 6 days a week sure earned a good review."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time with this place. Read the reviews and were told by a friend this place was good but were very disappointed. Ordered rare beef pho and pork vermicelli and both were very bland with no flavour. Will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great service. Delicious, well priced and authentic food. Take out or sit down and have some tea. Great with kids. Have the coconut curry noodle soup for a glimpse of heaven via your tongue. Your welcome."}
{"text":"Vietnamese food is a staple for me. It is the fast food I go for as I think it is a good balance of fresh and healthy, tasty and affordable. I tend to have Bun over Pho. I hadn't been to Pho Anh Huyen for years but a couple of friends were in the area and since it was convenient and fairly easy to get parking we ended up here. 
2 of us ordered the Bun and my other friend had a stir-fry ginger chicken on rice. My friend had the Chicken and Spring Rolls and I had the Chicken, Pork and Spring Rolls Bun. The biggest disappointment was the Chicken. It was dry and hard and the outside had a yellowish tinge from some type of spice. The chicken had obviously been pre-cooked and grossly overcooked. It was dry and hard. The pork I had was okay, well-seasoned. The Nuoc Cham was good, balanced between sweet and sour and very important to the overall dish. The chicken was palatable after it had been soaked in the sauce. The stir-fry was on the bland side and needed more ginger. I am giving the review 3-star because overall the taste was ok, the pork was cooked and tasted great, the portions are generous and the food is generally fresh (other than the chicken which I would recommend you avoid at all cost). They have a small parking lot which is shared by the take-out Chinese BBQ place next door. 
Pho Anh Huyen is family owned and it is the same husband and wife that have operated this establishment for YEARS. I think that there might be items that I would find as favourites and only come here for. It is like most Vietnamese restaurants for me, there are dishes I only order from some because they have what I consider the best of that dish. I tend to go to Pho So 1 for Pho, another place for Bun, and another just for their salad rolls.
Unless I have had a really horrible experience I tend to give a restaurant at least 2-3 tries before I either leave it off my places to go to. Service is friendly. They obviously have some loyal regulars so based on that I would come back and order something that seems to be a favourite of the regulars."}
{"text":"This is a cute family run restaurant. Husband is in the front while wife is cooking in the back.  I used to live around the corner from here and went there on a weekly basis. It was an addiction.

My standard order is the seafood curry pho (#31) and salad rolls.  Both are delicious. The curry pho has a creamy, spicy and coconut-y soup base that is totally addictive. It's unlike any other noodle in soup/pho that I've ever tried.  Seafood consists of prawns, squid and alaskan pollock.

Portions are generous, staff is friendly and the tea is complimentary!"}
{"text":"omg soo rude hung up when i asked for delivery"}
{"text":"Their chicken curry soup, shrimp roils and house special vegetable curry are all excellent dishes. The salad rolls are made fresh for each order. They have not been setting on a tray in the fridge waiting for someone to order to speed things up. The owners are like my friends, as I have been going here for years. The old gas station building hides a very special noodle house, so do not let appearances deceive you.."}
{"text":"The really special thing about Pho Anh Huyen is their coconut curry soups! So delicious and I haven't seen this style of soup elsewhere in the city. Spring rolls are very good too!"}
{"text":"\"It looks sketchy, but it's got the most delicious curry soup I've ever had.\" So said New Friend Jenn when we decided to meet for lunch this week. Turns out Pho Anh is her fave restaurant ever and I'm really glad she decided to share it with me!

Don't be scared of the outside, go inside. Sit down. And take in the oodles of choice soups on the menu. For real, there was like two pages of it in the first half of the menu and more selections in other areas. Though I didn't try the curry soup New Friend Jenn raved about, it sure did look delicious from across the table. Instead, I went with a Thai soup filled with octopus, shrimp and other meats I can't remember. The bowl was huge (and it was the regular sized one). I definitely fished my way through the soup to make sure I got all the meat and I inhaled as much broth as the rest of the cracks to fill between the meat in my tummy would allow. In the end I think it amounted to, like, half the bowl.

New Friend Jenn also taught me a superior way of eating all of those noodles. Instead of trying to slurp them up with her chopsticks, she'd use the chopsticks to put a few of them in her little spoon, and then eat them out of the spoon with a bit of broth and a piece of meat on top. Brilliant! She's the first person to ever eat soup with a spoon... ha! I'm only joking. But in all seriousness, it'll save you from any broth splashes down the front of your shirt.

Tip: At the end of your meal, don't wait for the bill. It doesn't come. Go up to the counter to pay instead."}
{"text":"I have continued to visit Pho Anh Huyen every so often since I last wrote my review. I appreciate it for its proximity, convenience, and affordability, especially when most of my friends and I are broke former Bachelor of Artists. 

My go to is usually a vegetarian vermicelli dish with no fish sauce, but I have also tried one of their soups (not pho) in the past, and triple check to make sure it is NOT beef or chicken broth, and am very clear that I am a strict vegan who requires veggie broth. Really, it's all one can do to make sure they are eating something that suits their requirements. The last time a vegetarian soup was ordered at our table, the manager explained what ingredients made up the soup; I would highly doubt they would be dishonest as my friends and I are recognizable by now and they know we would just order something else.

I was disappointed to see a review about Pho Anh Huyen using beef broth for their pho dish, but would also not be surprised because that is the case with most pho establishments I've experienced with a couple exceptions and I typically avoid it unless I am at one of my favourite joints where I've grilled them a thousand times over. Pho, but it also doesn't surprise me as far as a Pho dish goes if they do, because that is the case with most establishments in the area, except for Pho So 1 to my knowledge.

{"text":"My coworker and I came here for lunch - great pho!  

As with pho places, you don't come here for the decor!  It's a pretty small place where the staff are really friendly and it looks like there is a set of regulars who come here.  

I had a large number 8 which was done perfectly, amazingly good pho.  We also ordered spring rolls, which were also amazing!  Piping hot, perfectly crisp even after they'd cooled down slightly.  

The only complaint I had was for my coconut juice which was a little bit on the lukewarm side.  Otherwise, if I lived in Calgary, I'd come here often."}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary and this place is the best. Great quality, big portions and the place is clean. Not too many Vietnamese Restaurants have all 3 qualities."}
{"text":"My friend told me about this Vietnamese restaurant.  We ordered a plate of spring rolls which were quite tasty!  Our ordered noodle soups arrived -
- Curry Beef Vermicelli Soup
- Curry Seafood Vermicelli Soup 
These 2 noodle bowls had the same light coconut curry broth.  The soup was not spicy and once you squirt some lime and throw in some mint and bean sprouts, the soup comes alive!  Great broth!  The vermicelli is actually \"lai fan\", thinner, round rice noodles.
- Shrimp, Crab, Chicken, Squid Egg Noodle Soup - a big bowl of hot clear and delicious broth with egg noodles.

Fast service. I'd come back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent, hot and flavorful soup!!  Great service too!  This was our first time here but we'll be back.  The same people have owned this restaurant for 16 years."}
{"text":"Best I've found in Calgary. Great menu, great food, great grotty soup kitchen ambience. Everything I've tried was wonderful, and although not cheap, was priced reasonably. Check out the quail appetizer, and the curried seafood soup.

If you've seen my other reviews of Vietnamese in Calgary, you'll know I'm rather picky, so I'll let loose with my complaints about this joint: first off, it's all the way across town; secondly, they don't stay open late enough to conveniently go there regularly.

If you're local, you're damn lucky."}
{"text":"Went there last week and I find the young guy who served us unfriendly and seems like he is upset to be there. The dad however is very friendly and very warm and accommodating. 

I find the price a little bit more so than normal pho places. Coz the add on for tendon is 3 bucks vs my fave pho place $1.
The soup was really good though. Like its tasty and the portion is ok.
The salad roll was good. 
I would go back if I'm in the area but I wouldn't drive all the way to center street to go eat there.
The place is ok. Outdated but it gives the place it's home feeling."}
