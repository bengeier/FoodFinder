{"text":"This place is nice! Its small and quiet but a good place to sit and chat. Drinks are good owner is nice. Chess boards are nice. Place is very clean. I highly recommend and will visit again and often. Hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a coffee shop that WASN'T Starbucks and we stumbled upon this little gem located less than a mile East of the Best in the West shopping center.  The Owner was nice to chat with, helpful in making suggestions and genuinely enjoyed her work.  It is a comfortable and relaxing shop with paintings by local artists for sale.  She talked about the chess lessons and tournaments they have, she shared photos of previous events.  My husband had a plain coffee (his premise being you can tell a lot by the base coffee before trying the lattes and other drinks) and I had a hazelnut frappe.  He said the coffee was great and would definitely be back to try the others.  My frappe was one of the best I've had, you can actually taste the espresso in the drink, it is not overwhelmed by the taste of sugar like Starbucks.  We will definitely be back, the drinks were great and we like supporting the small business owners."}
{"text":"Super friendly and great atmosphere. Good Wifi and a nice patio for the days when Vegas isn't competing with hell for who's hotter.

And of course, with 5 stars, the coffee is gooood!"}
{"text":"Chess House is one of the most relaxing cafes. The drinks are delicious and you can enjoy the artwork they display for local artists as you sip your coffee. The staff is always friendly and wonderful."}
{"text":"Great place and atmosphere! Wonderful, fresh coffee. It's the only local coffee shop open on Sunday which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Great place! Went there this morning to get a cup of coffee and found out that it wasn't opened yet. But...great news! The owner was there and opened up the place for me. All I can say is the experience was awesome. The coffee was great and better yet it's close by. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Warm, inviting coffee shop with an incredibly friendly staff. Plenty of room for groups or individuals to relax or work. Definitely a great place to go if you're looking to get stuff done over a good cup of coffee"}
{"text":"This is a very quiet little place. Not very busy and they have 3-4 chess boards for use. Only 4 options for tea and the typical options for espresso drinks. The place isn't cozy like coffee house but the coffee is good."}
{"text":"Very friendly coffee house.  They use local Desert Wind beans. Open on Sundays. Nice and quite for studying.

Good coffee. Grabbed a pour over and it was fantastic!  Cheaper than Starbucks.
They are near the best buy, TJ Maxx, Ulta Beauty so you can grab some coffee and then go shopping afterwards."}
{"text":"I'm in the process for studying for an exam and needed a place with free wifi to study. I found Chess House on Yelp and it did not disappoint! Chess House is AWESOME, and black-owned :)

Drinks: I ordered a mango smoothie, and it was perfect. My smoothie had the right texture and had a delicious flavor. I would order it again, especially in the hot summer months. Did I mention it was reasonably priced?! I also noticed small bites on the menu such as croissants, muffins, sandwiches and wraps.

Environment: Upon walking into the coffee house you will find beautiful hand painted artwork on the walls. There is smooth jazz/neo-soul playing, and a friendly face to greet you. There is plenty of space to study or play chess. They also have a drive-thru for those who don't want to get out of their car, although I do think it's worth coming inside. It's also an impeccably clean establishment.

Owner: I was lucky enough to meet the owner, Garnita. She is absolutely amazing! You can tell that she has put so much love and work into making this coffee shop a place where all feel welcome.  I really wish her the best of luck and plan on being a frequent customer!"}
{"text":"Great location! Very chill 
Not overpriced at all pretty good price and also the environment is very calming and relaxing 
The double chocolate cake  is very good too! 
I suggested any of the lattes or teas."}
{"text":"I've driven past a few times and this morning decided to try out new coffee shop. I pulled into the drive thru at 8:40 am. One car in front of me. It took almost 5 min for the clerk to get payment from that customer. After another 3 min I backed out of the drive thru and left. I have a job to get to. It should not take almost 10 min. All I wanted was an iced tea. I couldn't even order my drink. If you can't move your drive thru during rush hour (when there was not actual rush) you will not last. If you want people to take their time in your establishment I suggest doing away with drive thru. I will not be stopping inside if this is how they treat customers."}
{"text":"LOVE these ladies!!! They make the best coffee in town! I used to follow them at the different farmer's markets. They are a total novelty!"}
{"text":"Love this new coffee cafe.  Relaxed setting and super friendly staff.  If you want to learn how to play or already love playing chess you have a fun new place to do just that while enjoying a great coffee selection  
Great spot to meet up with friends or plan a gathering."}
{"text":"Nice spot to add a coffee option to the area, props for utilizing the drive-thru which likely gets them more business. Interior is on the plain side and the bakery case is limited. My skinny vanilla latte was okay. Nothing in particular stood out here and though the location is quiet, it's still so new and bare that it didn't quite feel like a spot to linger and get some work done. Hopefully they will add some umbrellas so that the patio seating can be utilized."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Delicious Gourmet Coffee! Had a Skinny sugar free vanilla and hazelnut latte, actually the best one I've ever had. And they have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"So happy that there's a coffee shop so close to my house! We used the drive thru since we had our pup with us, and although the placement is kind of awkward, the service was great! It's a very basic menu, and I'm not quite sure if they would do special requests, since we just ordered a blended ice mocha. 

My only issue was probably due to personal preference: the drink was a bit too icy and not caffeinated enough for my taste. Maybe I'll ask for an extra shot next time.

Other than that, keep it up, Chess House!"}
{"text":"This is probably the most comfortable spot to study I love it here . Good energy the owner is very kind and a lovely person always making my coffee really good."}
{"text":"TWO THUMBS UP!

The internet at my house went down, so I was thankful my boyfriend already knew all about Chess House Cafe.  The Chess House Cafe has free wi-fi that is highly reliable and saved me, as a remote working employee.  If wi-fi at your coffee shop is a MUST, this is your place!  There are also TONS of outlets so you can charge your electronics if you are looking to work from the coffee shop.

Okay, now onto the more important things...  

COFFEE!  Chess House Cafe has a really get selection of coffee options, hot coffee, cold coffee, the works!  Even if you aren't a huge coffee fan, they have other options such a tea and smoothies.  This is something here for everyone.

SNACKS!  There are some snacks for your to purchase when you are having out at the coffee shop.  There are donuts, croissants, bagels, chips, wraps, and even grilled cheese!  All of the fares are perfect for your breakfast or lunch needs.  I've only had the bagel and cream cheese so far, but the bagel was nicely toasted and the cream cheese came in a single use packet.

OWNER!  I, unfortunately, didn't catch her name, but the woman who owns this awesome establishment is SO INCREDIBLY FRIENDLY.  Smiles from ear to ear, remember's people who have come in before, and is happy to converse over her early years of playing Chess with her Dad (hence the theme) and her first cassettes and records.  I love supporting small businesses and super awesome owners.

ENVIRONMENT!  As the name hints at, Chess is a big deal over here!  There are several Chess boards running around and you can frequently find a friendly face to play with.  There are also some other games such as Checkers and Mancala, a bookshelf full of books, and a giant table that fits about eight to chill out all of your friends.  There are more than enough tables to have lots of people hanging out or working.  There is also a radio playing some groovy music.  It's not loud enough to interrupt your discussions, but loud enough to hear.

DRIVE THRU WINDOW!  Haven't used it, but there is a drive thru!  No excuses for not stopping here for your morning cup of joe!

Most recently, I got two 24 OZ coffee and a bagel with cream cheese for about $10!  Seriously?  Only $10??  Who needs *cough* Starbucks *cough*!  Personally speaking, the quality of the drinks, the price of drinks/food, and the atmosphere are exactly what I look for in a local coffee joint.  Make sure you come on down and support your local coffee shop!"}
{"text":"I love my coffee especially when it strays away from the Starbucks chain. And I also love me so Drive thru for those lazy days. This new spot is located in a little plaza off Torrey Pines and Lake Mead. I tried the Drive thru since I was rushing. There's no speaker where the menu is and you order when you get to the window. Thankfully there was no one in front me, so the wait was very short but if there was a line, having no speaker would slow down the service I imagine. I tried ordering a java chip frappe but they were out of chips :( , so whom I perceive to be the owner, suggested the blended mocha for me and I enjoyed it very much. She also gave me a stamp card which was nice. Its nice to have a new coffee spot in town"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee in a wonderful, relaxing environment. I love the local art on the walls, the bookshelf full of books to read and the chess games ready to play. The hummus on organic wheat toast was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place out for a few months and finally got the chance to today. The store is quaint and cozy, though much larger than it looks from the outside. The owner was working the counter and was very helpful and sweet. She explained that they're still going through changes and working on improving the food menu. We ordered a java chip frappe, a green tea matcha frappe and two chicken Caesar wraps, as well as an iced mocha to go for my boyfriend. The coffee drinks were very good, I'm not a coffee expert but I really liked the taste of the espresso they use. The matcha frappe was ok, but had a chalky kind of aftertaste, and the Caesar wraps were also just ok. Using grilled chicken instead of what tasted like heated up pre-fried chicken strips would be a great improvement. Overall this place has great coffee and a nice atmosphere. The owner seems really excited and passionate about her business and it's understandable that they're still working out the kinks. I'll definitely be back in a month or two to see the improvements and will update my review."}
{"text":"Great coffee and atmosphere! It's not super noisy so you can get your work done, and the owner and her team are always very friendly. Definitely recommend this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Has WiFi so if I can't find a live chess opponent I can play Internet chess while enjoying a great iced coffee.  Relaxed easy going environment conducive to chess, studying, reading, or anything else requiring quiet while enjoying caffeinated refreshments. Now if we could only get a few more chess players to show up regularly....."}
{"text":"Visited the other day. Cute interior design and the server was very nice ! Nice relaxing atmosphere and delicious matcha latte"}
{"text":"Popped into this coffee shop while I had some spare time. It's a really great vibe & the staff is super friendly. It serves as a great meeting place with numerous tables of varying sizes, or a great place to do some work privately (this is what I did). 

The prices are super reasonable & the coffee is good. I highly recommend this coffee shop. 

Ps - Chess fans rejoice. There are chess boards on some of the tables. 

Well done!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool, you can tell it's new, loved the concept as well. However, I do wish they had more breakfast type options like bagels, muffins, etc, even some breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"We were looking for a small coffee house and happened upon this great spot. Comfy, friendly staff and great drinks. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First off, I avoid the mainstream coffee places and seek out locally owned places, and I'm glad I did. This is a gem of a coffee house. There are beautiful paintings on the walls and of course, games of chess to play. They also have checkers, mancala, and a bookshelf full of book options. The owner is lovely and makes a good strong coffee. You can grab a quick snack like donuts, muffins, and a few different kind of sandwiches and wraps. I'll definitely be a return customer."}
{"text":"Great little coffee place right across from of our Church!  The folks here are friendly, warm and caring and the coffee is freshly roasted right here in town!  It's also a great place to get some wifi and read a book or play a match of chess (or checkers for the kids!)"}
{"text":"I heard about this place opening and had to visit. Chess House Case is what every coffee shop should be. The atmosphere, the owner, the coffee and the people all get 5 stars! I will be back for a panini and cappuccino!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here just to grab a quick coffee and post them to work and I met Garnita the owner. I ordered a wonderful sugar-free vanilla with cinnamon latte over ice very tasty very quick service nice interior and hear great artwork open-air , cool great music definitely a spot all frequent either for chess or work on my laptop or to just be still.
Tonight they're having spoken word which will be fun."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee. The beans are from Desert Wind coffee so you know it's good. Granita, the owner, is super nice and accommodating to your tastes and makes sure the drinks are to your liking. She's really sweet and friendly too, which is a lovely bonus.  Plus, there are books and chessboards to keep you occupied if you're in need of something to do! So whether you want a pick me up, to study or are bored, this place has got you covered!!"}
{"text":"The coffee was great! Inside the store you can play chess. The owner is a lovely lady who cares about bringing people together. If this coffee house were closer to my regular routes I would definitely come here more often!"}
{"text":"I really love this coffee house. The drinks are great, staff is friendly and the place is really clean. This place deserves to do well because you can tell it's run with love. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Nice coffee house with a great vibe. Owner was there brewing coffee and was really friendly. With good music, some books, and tables set up for chess or other games, this place becomes you to hang out all day."}
{"text":"Very beautiful Ambience good coffee equal to Starbucks. People go try nice to have in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"My son and I had a banana foster frappe and a caramel macchiato.  The drinks were great.  The owner and atmospher are top notch.  I would recommend going there for your drink and possibly a wrap, etc."}
{"text":"This is officially my new hang out spot! Fast free wifi with an excellent selection of coffee.  This place is brand new and so cute!  The owner is just as sweet and humble as can be and very welcoming.  I'm excited to see this place grow and offer more bakery items as I personally only indulge in hot teas.  I love the chess theme so nerds unite!   Can't wait to bring my boyfriend up and show him how it's done!"}
{"text":"The owner is such a sweetheart!! She has been here all 3 times I've been here, and is always so accommodating. They have chess boards on most of the tables, and she will move them if you need to study and want a certain table. Delicious coffee, frappes and lemonade!!!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, great food, and great atmosphere.  Good place for a game of chess, to relax and read, use wifi or hang out with friends. Sometimes there's even live music or entertainment. Every time I come, I feel welcomed."}
{"text":"The owner is very pleasant! The ambiance is relaxing! Coffee taste better than Starbucks to me! Plus I enjoy supporting local businesses and will return to try other menu options."}
