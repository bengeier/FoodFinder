{"text":"Love  this paella and caterer!!  JJ makes it all seem effortless and the food is so delicious!  All of her cooking equipment is portable so she can set up in a quiet corner of your yard, campsite, or anywhere you desire!  The cooking process is a show of its own and entertainment for your guests. Amazing appetizers as well!"}
{"text":"I recently attended a house party with Saffron Pig catering. Wow! Everything from the savory appetizers to the dessert was amazing. I didn't think I Iiked paella until I tried Chef JJ's version. She talked to us as she cooked, telling us about how she made it. She is so personal and interesting. My mouth waters every time I think of those warm dessert empanadas. Whether a private party or a corporate function, this catering company will leave guests smiling and well-fed!"}

She made Tapas (potato bravas and these cheesy stuffed peppers) and awesome paella and even Sangria (best sangria ever everyone agreed). I studied abroad in Spain and had loads of paella.. Saffron pig is authentic and delicious! Will definitely recommend!"}

Our guests were just thrilled with the concept of paella as a catered event and absolutely loved the food. We cannot thank you enough JJ!"}
