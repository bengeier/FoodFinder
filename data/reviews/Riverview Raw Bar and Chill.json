{"text":"Nice casual place.  We had raw oysters on the half shell. They were excellent quality expertly shucked.  Also had oysters Rockefeller, again quite good well done.   Then tried the Maryland style crab cakes.   We are from Baltimore so we know good crabs. And let's just say we tried \"Maryland style crab cakes at many many places and they all failed, and riverview was no exception.   What is so hard about lump crab meat. Very little filler then bake or fry?!?!"}
{"text":"We ate at the original Riverview around 2-3 times a month for over 30 years.  It was a big disappointment when they closed after 67 years at this location.  We were excited when we learned the Riverview had reopened, so we went to check it out.  They did a facelift on the interior and added a new bar.  They kept the casual and homey feel, which was nice.  They have removed most of the seating in the large back dining room and converted it into a game room and dance hall with a bandstand.  They mounted a bunch of TV's around the restaurant and they were tuned to college basketball.  We were there for dinner, so these additions were of little interest to us. We were seated quickly, and our drinks were brought at once.  We ordered the blackened oysters appetizer.  It took 25 minutes before the appetizer and salads were brought out.  The salad was unremarkable and the spoonful of dressing was not enough.  The oysters were essentially raw and coated in spices.  Fortunately, we like raw oysters so we really didn't have a problem with that, other than the powdery taste of the spice.  If you are expecting to have your oysters cooked (as 'blackened' usually indicates) steer clear of this dish. A short time later the entrees were delivered.  But, they weren't OUR entrees.  The waitstaff apparently got their tables mixed up and they belonged elsewhere.  Our entrees finally arrived almost an hour after we ordered, and the food was NOT worth the wait.  I ordered the Mediterranean Tuna cooked rare.  The fish had barely touched the skillet, was not seared properly, and was pretty much cold and raw throughout.  Again, I like sushi so the lack of cooking was not the problem, rather the black olive chutney they covered the fish with was bitter and unappetizing, totally ruining the meat.  The menu said it was served over rice, but I didn't get that.  Instead they substituted a bowl of bland grits.  I also tried the slaw, but it was totally bland also.  I was really hoping they had gotten the original Burns' Riverview sour slaw recipe, but clearly they did not. My wife got the blackened salmon, which was cooked nicely, but her sides also included the grits and a mixed veg bowl that she did not care for.  A slice or two of lemon and some tartar would have gone a long way to improving the dish. As we looked around (plenty of free time during the wait) we saw that we were not alone in receiving slow food service. We spoke to the manager, and he apologized for the long wait and cited 'equipment problems' in the kitchen.  He offered to comp the meal, but when the check arrived we were charged full price.  To be fair, the manager spoke to us as we were leaving and offered a refund, but at that point we just wanted to leave. If we see feedback that they have improved their service and quality, we may give them another try sometime in the future, but, after this experience, it is not on the horizon."}
{"text":"First off I've lived in charlotte for over 30 years and never noticed this place until one of my coworkers took me here this week. At first glimpse the place appears to be old on the exterior, however I'm glad to say that the view is much better in the inside. I ordered the pick 3 seafood platter and choose the crab cakes, flounder, shrimp and side of southern style fresh collars greens. All that I can say was that this food was some of the best I've had in years especially for such a low price.  This spot even gives you the option to get your seafood blackened, fried, or prepared with salt and pepper. The flounder was fried perfect and the breading on the fish was light and wasn't overwhelming like some places prepare. The shrimp were not over cooked and had a great flavor. Did I mention what I would call the slap your mommy twice collard greens. The collard greens were seasoned so perfect and cooked down as perfect as anyone could ever ask. For desert I also ordered homemade key lime pie. Me and my coworkers couldn't stop talking about just how good and affordable this place was. It was as if I'd discovered a hidden treasure that was literally right in face all of this time. The places is very convenient to the airport, Belmont, and is located right after the big amazon warehouse building on Wilkerson boulevard. Later that night I told my mom about this place and she ordered the Philly cheesesteak and kept going on and on about how delicious it was. Seriously speaking if you want a menu which includes a wide variety of different foods from Philly cheesesteaks , to fresh seafood , to cheap beer with a country feel visit this place !!!!"}
{"text":"We wanted this place to be a lot better than it was. We were drawn in by the idea of it being on the water.  We requested to be sat outside on the patio and after sitting there too long, had to go ask for service. Someone did come over promptly after the request. The menu looked ok, nothing stellar and not much creativity. I wanted something light, so I opted for the salad bar. Mediocre selection and it looked like most came out of a can, but it did appear to be maintained and mostly stocked. My fiance got a burger and fries, this was also a mediocre choice.  Beer selection was ok, food was ok, service was ok (one of the draft beers the server was unsure of, I think there were only 4 on the list. They also did not make an effort to find out), the view is ok. I am sad to say I would not suggest this place and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Its a hole in the wall kind of place. Very laid back just had the apps and a few drinks but fast service and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was worried the first time we drove up. It looks like a typical fish camp--total dive. Don't let it fool you. The interior is cheesy and campy. Not upscale at all. The prices of the food is in the $15-$20 which for G-town is a little expensive. But this place really delivers. The fish and seafood is really good. The side of saut√©ed veggies are hand cut squash, zucchini and onion--not the standard frozen blend of carrots, broc and cauliflower. Their mussel appetizer is delish. Best of all are the Thursday Crab Leg nights for $13 you get 1.5 pounds of steamed legs, salad, and two sides. I always take the sides home because I'm stuffed. Only one point off because sometimes the seafood mac and cheese comes out cold and underbaked. When it's baked properly, nice and toasty-it's heavenly. Also, the manager/owner (?) is super attentive. When I mentioned some issues he was very prompt to rectify it. We've been several times and it's always a nice escape."}
{"text":"Here we go Saturday night and they have prime rib. So it was not hot and mashed taters were warm and I say order it now. The flavor was awesome. A must do. Appetizers was fried green tomatoes they were phenomenal. Salad was crisp service was excellent beer was cold. Hush puppies were great excellent herb garlic butter. Just all around good. Not del friscos but not the check. Go check it out and enjoy. Really nice for the price I recommend."}
{"text":"Very Disappointing! We ate there on a Friday night.  The staff definitely needs more training. Our waitress had tables all over the restaurant so it was difficult to get her attention. We waited a little over twenty minutes for our beer which arrived only slightly cool. Our salads arrived at different times. By the time my husband's salad arrived our entrees were being delivered. When my husband complained a manager did come talk to us and offered to redo the entrees so my husband would have time to finish his salad. Appreciated the gesture but didn't want to send our dinner back. Manager did comp dessert which was nice. Our waitress seemed to forget about us and did not seem to know the menu or beer selection very well.  The scallops in the Seared Scallop appetizer were overcooked and tasteless. The Seared Tuna was ok but nothing special. The BEST dish we tried was the shrimp and grits-definitely a winner. It gets the stars!  The restaurant was loud with the vibe of a bar not a restaurant. There are too many other options so we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Purchased a goupon and thought we would try this restaurant.  Sorry we wasted our money and evening. Were told we had 69.00 to use...didn't say that on goupon... said one appetizer, 2 drinks and 2  meals.  I have purchased lots of these and know how this works.  After sending two meals back...we were told were still owed for drinks... I told the \"owner\" \"manager\" to just take my meal off since I didn't eat.. .he said you owe and I paid and said we would not be back.  do not waste your money or your time with this place...with this attitude they won't be around..."}
{"text":"So, its kind of gross.  When you first walk in, you will know what I mean.  The food is OK.  I got a poboy and it was average at best.  My wife got fish tacos.  Also average.  However, if you are after oysters, they do a great job.  Super fresh and well prepared.  Service is good and the view is nice.  My recommendation, pass."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday for the first time since the old Riverview Inn closed and loved it!  It still feels like a neighborhood joint and the menu has great options for everyone (even me as a gluten-free diner).   The tuna appetizer had quality raw tuna with a healthy dose of wasabi on the side and the humus was delicious too even though I ate it without the pita. I've heard about the events they hold here regularly and will definitely be coming back for Sunday morning yoga and mimosas, then some karaoke! This is a new summertime favorite."}
{"text":"Based on reviews we were hesitant but also thankful for the preperation provided by fellow yelpers.  True, not the best configuration to enjoy the water which I find so confusing. I mean, it's on the friggin river folks!  Gut that place and put up windows all the way across the back. Anyway on to the food. I've been itching for some oysters and they actually had them, very fresh on the half shell. I was a little shocked honestly because there were literally no people in there. We didn't have any other real food but I can say I thought 3 beers and 18 oysters for 35 bucks was a little steep. The menu looked like your normal fair. Fried fish, burgers etc.  So the real reason for the mediocre review is the bartender. She was kind of stand-offish which is fine but then leaned over our oysters and said \"I ain't ever had oysters cause they look like snot\" .  Sooooo, yea still eating sister. That could have been shared later or possibly not at all. It's certainly not a fancy place and it's not trying to be.  I might be back in the summer to see if it's a fun afternoon place."}
{"text":"Husband and I visited there on my birthday we had a Groupon and dinner was OK. The appetizers were good the salad was very good. It was very fresh and the dressing was homemade. As for dinner it was so so... Crab legs my husband ordered were average and I ordered shrimp and grits which were ok but wouldn't rave about them. The location is awesome on the river and I really like the environment. It's  a cool little bar in a little town. I thought it was a little expensive for what we ate however the service was awesome! I would go back if I was in the area but not make a special trip. I don't think we ordered the correct things off the menu for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Much more that I was expecting. The food was great. I would recommend this place if you are new to this area like I was. The peel and eat shrimp is what I had. The view overlooking the lake just added to my dinner experience."}
{"text":"The blacken flounder was so good. I could have had 2 more plates. We went tonight because they were having comedy show. (Spanky Brown). It was a good night enjoyed the adult night out. Will be back for more food and fun."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place. If I can say anything good, it would be that the outdoor seating is so pretty and relaxing and the staff is VERY friendly, however the food is terrible. I ordered the charbroiled oysters, my Husband ordered the jambalaya and my daughter got the shrimp. ALL three dishes were disgusting! Worst 100 bucks I've ever spent. I recommend this place ONLY if u want to sit outside and have a few (very expensive) beers. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Great service, Joy was a pleasure! Funny the look the hostess gave me when I asked if I could sit outside. In the sun. It's hot and humid here yes but as I'm heading home to a winter storm warming I need to soak up as much as I can!  Peel & eat shrimp were good but I would have appreciated a wet wipe after. Raw oysters on the half shell weren't as briny or fresh tasting as I remember from living in Texas but as these were shipped from Louisiana I guess that's understandable. If I'd known I would have ordered them cooked. The shrimp and grits however was absolutely incredible, very filling!!"}
{"text":"I had hot broiled shrimp. Side order of collard greens & baked potato. The shrimp were large & Great with flavor. Baked potato was good, not exactly worth $2.50 extra. Didn't care for the collard greens. They were very bland. live band the night we went, a bar atmosphere. Staff was nice. Waitress was a little distant but no real complaints. Older building so it had a lil odor like closed up smell."}
{"text":"This place is situated right on the Catawba River, very close to the US National Whitewater Center.  I had a nice lunch here on the deck, and enjoyed seeing a crane out in the water.  Apparently you can feed the turtles as well, but I didn't see any while I was there.  The hummus was a decent appetizer.  Tried the shrimp and ahi tuna tacos for my entree, and they were both good.  Slightly spicy sauce on them.  Service was good and the people were friendly.  If you're in the area, it's probably worth a stop."}
{"text":"1st time visiting was this past weekend, 7/8/17.  What a great place!!  It could use a little lightening up is about the only bad thing we can say.  I cannot say enough for the staff and especially the owner (can't remember his name right now), they were all so friendly and we felt the true southern hospitality we moved from New York to find.  They welcomed us (including our 2 pups) right in.  The oysters were off the chain, biggest and freshest my fiance has ever had.  I had the tuna tacos, FANTASTIC!! and he had the shrimp po' boy, was delicious too.  Great beer selection too!  We live in Steele Creek and will visit as often as we can, wish it was closer...such a better choice than T-Bones for sure."}
{"text":"Oysters on the half shell were served on polished shells. Oysters bot in bulk and laid on polished shells. Lobster $21.95 might have know, tough and rubbery. Coleslaw was hot. Server said it was under the warming light to long. Don't waste you time food bad."}
{"text":"We had a great experience tonight at the Riverview! We had Ashley as our waitress and she was fabulous. Ashley kept the drinks coming and was on top of the food orders. I had the Ribeye and Salad with the Italian dressing. I could drink that Italian dressing. We will for sure be back and hope to catch some live music."}
{"text":"A hidden gem and one of the few restaurants on Lake Wylie. They serve all you can eat crab legs on certain days of the week. Pleasantly surprised one night when they had stand up comedian- pretty entertaining. Decent beer and menu selection. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I've had many great meals at Riverview.  There are only 2 restaurants on Lake Wylie and I will never eat at Tbones again after we found Riverview.  The oysters have always been excellent! The interior has a dive feel but we have always eaten on the porch outside.  If you come to this place trying to make it something its not, then you will be disappointed.  If you want good seafood 200 miles from the ocean without paying crazy prices, this is the place."}
{"text":"Fried oysters at a Raw Bar should be awesome.  The hush puppies looked better on my plate.  Shrinkage was the reason the waiter said came from the chef. I've eaten fried seafood as a New Englander all my life...what you start with is important.  For $16 I let my waiter know I was disappointed. Ultimately they let me slide out ...probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Well, I too am of the crowd that went here back in the day. As a kid I used to love coming here for seafood and to see Captain Wendy. When we moved near this side of town, I was so disappointed that Riverview was closed. Now it's open again, but new and improved!  The food is not the same fare as before. That's fine though, because it has an updated vibe. I personally love the Oyster Po Boy, probably about as close as you are going to get to New Orleans in Charlotte. They also have excellent raw oysters.  The staff is generally pretty friendly and knowledgable, I haven'y really had any issues. The view is great. When it's a nice day, the deck right next to the water is awesome. This place is huge though, so when the weather isn't nice and the crowds aren't out, it can feel a little cavernous. I went there for lunch today and me and my buddy were literally the ONLY people in there at a place that seats hundreds.  With the food being good, and reasonably priced, and decent beer prices, I hope it will stick around. I'd say if I had to offer areas of improvement, get a better beer selection. They have some craft brews, but they've got room for more.  Atmosphere: Inside 3.5 stars, Outside 4.5 stars  Food: 4 Stars Service: 4 Stars Price / Value: 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I have to avoid gluten, so i ordered a dozen raw with veggies and mashed potatoes. It was great! I had a fun time here with Joy as my bartender and shot the sh!t with the owner until close. It's a real gem if you ask me and I would eat there weekly if I lived in the area (I got stuck in Charlotte overnight due to a flight delay). Good times, don't miss out!"}
{"text":"My diverse group of friends have mentioned their experiences at Riverview since its opening in November.  We were finally able to make our first visit this past weekend, and I'm glad we did.  This will be the first summer season for the restaurant, and with the great weather we enjoyed while sitting upon the patio, this will definitely be an awesome destination to \"chill\".    The expanded outdoor spaces of the restaurant made a great first impression, while the food selection helped to seal-the-deal.  Fresh seafood, healthy portions & reasonable prices made the decision of what to eat very difficult....so we sampled plenty of selections starting with the appetizers all the way to the desserts.  We've known the owner, Jason, for a several years now.  He is as dedicated and energized with this new venture as he is with everything he has accomplished previously.  He visited with each table of guests, exchanging laughs and spreading the excitement of the season to come.  For all those within the Greater Gastonia area who are looking for a great option to enjoy food, music and friends while supporting local businesses, Riverview is for you and yours."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  Everybody is always friendly, and I've never had anything to eat here that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.  I am currently so full and content that I think I will go home and go to bed."}
{"text":"Went in here to eat on July 4th. I had the salmon. I wasn't that impressed with my meal. The salmon was okay and my homemade chips tasted old and were cold. The salad bar was mediocre. The service was very good though. It is boat accessible which is the way we got there and convenient."}
{"text":"We attended the \"old\" restaurant and were very pleasantly surprised by the upgrades and the food quality/price.  We went on a Wednesday night (around 7pm)  and sat outside on the deck in the non-smoking section.  Service was quick and the waitress stopped by on a regular basis to ensure we had everything we needed.  Portions were huge and the prices were very reasonable.  There were four of us and the entrees we had were the fish tacos, fish platter and two salads. All the food arrived at the same time (in about 20 minutes from our ordering) and everyone enjoyed their food.  In talking with my neighbors, they have all been here multiple times and had good service and enjoyed the food.  It is nice we don't have to travel all the way down to Buster Boyd bridge to have a waterfront meal.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Good place.  Daily specials.  Friendly staff. Rustic but comfortable. Have been here twice for oysters and haven't been disappointed. Need to try some of the other good looking things on the menu."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting.  We live in Mt Holly and decided to check it out.   Owner greeted us and was very friendly.   Ordered Cajun Oysters.   Very good.  For dinner my husband ordered the crab cake sandwich.  Crab cake very big and  fresh. The bacon on it was kind of a joke. 1 very small piece of bacon broke in half.  Don't call it a BLT when you skimp on the bacon.   I ordered Shrimp tacos and I was brought the shrimp plate.  The waitress realized she made a mistake and apologized.  By the time I got my dinner my husband was done with his.   The food was good but the service is average although friendly. It wasn't horrible.  We will give it another try.   The seafood was fresh and the best around."}
{"text":"If it was possible I would have given no stars however that's not how this rating system works. We wanted a nice date night and we decided on this place because our experience there last year was great. They had  just reopened for the year and our visit tonight will be the very last. The appetizer was greasy and smothered in cheese and usually that would be ok since I love cheese but considering this was to be a crab and artichoke dip we ended up only eating about half the food. The deal breaker was my riverview crab cake meal. The cakes were made with claw meat and doing so caused a horrible overbearing fishy taste and I lost it. My grits was cold and french fries were hard. Just to mention this was my favorite dish last year. My husband's food was fried oysters and he wasn't impressed with his either. So rather than send everything back which is not our style I told the waiter the food was horrible and we just want the check so we can go. We were charged full price on everything and he then walked away. That's all well and good but word of mouth goes further than $60.00 however knowing a complaint on the subpar food and refusal to have it replaced should have been enough for the manager to at least offer an apology the very least rather than have us ignored"}
{"text":"Great place for a drink on lake wylie could use a serious update would increase  their business 10 fold"}
{"text":"This place was a amazing breath of fresh air. Right on the river this place has it all. We had the mussels, pulled pork plate, and a crab cake BLT. All of which were the picture of perfection. The staff was vefy attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. Located right off 485 makes it accessible to anyone in Charlotte. Highly recommend this place as it definitely is my new favorite restaurant bar."}
{"text":"Love this place. I love the casual but beautiful river atmosphere. The live music. Breeze off the water. It's all very relaxing and perfect after a long work week. The service was great and very friendly and attentive. The food was also really fantastic. I highly suggest the oysters. Fresh. Good. The shrimp was good and husband enjoyed the flounder sandwich. Awesome beer specials too. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The outdoor seating is great for a sunny day. The food is good. I would definitely recommend oysters on the half shell :)"}
{"text":"Great dinner last Saturday night w/ Joe & Robyn. Place was packed so we had a couple beers at the bar before we were seated. Other than being out of salmon visit was great. Shrimp platter was enormous, Fish Taco's looked good too. Everything was perfectly cooked & delicious. Good music from the live band they had playing out back. See ya again soon!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money. When they first opened the staff and food was great. Since then it's gone way down hill. FYI- do not, I repeat do not use the bathrooms'"}
{"text":"Just about everything about the new restaurant is an improvement since it reopened. The band playing while we were there was great. Our waitress was fantastic! We'll be going back for more oysters, wine, and entertainment."}
{"text":"Just left this place. Upon entering the foyer there was a bad odor maybe it's just age. Folks standing at the bar all turned as we walked in and my husband made the comment that we were the only minorities in the building. It showed on the hostess face as well. He looked at the seating chart and said that there was a 30 minute wait but there was no one else waiting. Will not be going back not welcoming and no place for minorities! Shame!"}
{"text":"Went there for Restaurant week to have some oysters. After we ordered our drinks the server came over to take our order. I ordered a  dozen of steamed oysters. He then told me they were out of oysters on the half shell. We drove 20 min to try this place out. Come on, aren't you suppose to be a raw bar? Really bad timing to run out of something that was included on the restaurant week menu."}
{"text":"There isn't a lot of view at the riverview unless you're out on the deck - and even then, it's only a small section. Probably better to pack a lunch and eat from the parking lot.  Inside, the place is cavernous - and there are not a lot of tables inside either. Most of the customers we saw (all three of them) were gathered around the bar, which naturally had them facing away from the river.  As to service, they were apparently also facing the bar, because it took a long, long time to get served, and when we finally did, it took a long time to actually receive anything we ordered - not that it's a bad thing, because we at least were able to take in the view of a couple ladies smoking on the patio.  Once the food finally arrived, it was completely underwhelming. Should have packed the picnic."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible restaurant. Have been there more than once and literally seen rats and other creatures in and around the restaurant. Poor service and rude staff. Place should be condemned"}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon for Riverview and due to the decent reviews, thought we would try it out. Should have saved my money and time.   The food was flavorless and left much to be desired. The service wasn't horrible, our drinks were constantly being refilled and everything came out in a timely manner.   Ordered the fried calamari because I was intrigued it came with banana peppers; thin calamari pieces, weak batter. Should have tried the shrimp instead. Entrees of seared Mediterranean tuna over rice pilaf with hush puppies and snow crab clusters with the tomato cucumber salad and yellow grits. The tuna entree came out cold; not even lukewarm. The \"Mediterranean\" topping on the tuna (described as tomatoes, feta and olives) was just olives. The tomato cucumber salad was soggy as though it had been prepared many days ago and left to sit. The grits were bland.   When we were ready for the bill and told the server we had a Groupon, her demeanor instantly changed and she was cold and rude.   Couldn't even make it home before we started to feel sick. I would NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great Resturant off the beaten path. Nice relaxing water views and outdoor seating.  You can tell a lot of their customers are repeat and have been coming there a long time.  The wait staff were really sweet and food came out fast.  Great chargrilled oysters and awesome oysters Rockefeller.  The crab dip though recommend- I sent back because I could not taste one bit of crab or artichokes.  The steam pot was pretty good but could be improved-ie the sausage and crab legs were cooked great but the corn was not cooked fully and the shrimp were completely overcooked.  But still great low key place to eat seafood with no frills."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food, service, entertainment, atmosphere, and prices are perfect...if I say so myself.  They have Sunday morning Yoga by the water, and I hope to be able to come check that out soon.  Great place."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a local. While the view was so nice, right on the lake. The food needs improvement. The drinks were spot on!"}
{"text":"Riverview could be so much more with a little effort. I've been with friends on a boat several times for drinks just to have an alternative to T-Bones because Duke doesn't allow much on Lake Wylie so we're regaled to these two choices. My bf and I went yesterday, thought we might have a nice seafood platter. It appeared dirty and unkempt. The guy at the host stand was nice enough but everything just seemed unorganized on the front of the house. Our waitress, a very pretty African American girl with long hair said she didn't know what I meant when I asked what imports they had on tap ... bless her heart; don't just grab a young girl and throw her out there with a pad and pencil, lol. Train her. Not her fault but just didn't seem to have a clue about server standards, technique, their offerings, etc. I got a Blue Moon in the bottle and she informed me it was the last one, wth, they weren't busy at all. Needs new management, training, etc. could be a gem on the water but definitely not worth the drive.  I love dogs and am not bothered by ppl bringing them to an outdoor venue. That said, my Bf was turned off as there were a lot on the deck when we got there and the table closest to us was letting theirs eat from the table. Not really sanitary in a commercial environment - and yes we have pets in the house.  I'd think with their deck not being on the water it's out of the constraints of Duke Energy and they could rebuild and angle for a better view/clean it up. Just kinda rough/old/needing repair all the way around.  We only got one beer and ordered a chicken quesadilla so we could go elsewhere to eat. To the kitchen's credit the quesadilla was very good. Unfortunately I feel if they have great food or kitchen talent, many ppl may leave without trying their fare based on the roughness of the front end.   Unless I hear it's made a 180, doubt I'll ever return. A shame we don't have more choices on the lake."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I've had ever! My 23.00 steak was unseasoned and rubbery.  The 18.00 crab cakes were disgusting according to te people that ordered  them. I had 4 to-go orders and even though we had a party of 9, they added mandatory 18% tip for parties of 10 or more saying th to-go ordered counted as part of the party. The service was so terrible, I requested my to-go meals separated from my check as to not have to tip on the total. Our waitress even appeared to be high on something.  When I requested the separate ticket for the to-go orders, I was approached by the manager on duty who refused. I asked him to cancel the to-go orders and I would call them in separately. He laughed, refused, and then proceeded to ban me and my entire family from the restruamt and escorted us out.  My entire family had to leave immediately at meet down the street at the Dairy Queen to discuss what happened! It was my nieces birthday and it was ruined.."}
{"text":"I rate a restaurant on affordability, quality, and ambience. Affordability 4 star, quality 4 star, ambience 3 star. The steamed shrimp were quick to come out and very good. I had fried oysters and she had grilled shrimp. I liked the oysters a lot. The shrimp were a little small. Overall was very quick preparing the food, brought out hot, and a good price. We came on a Sunday about 5. Not very busy at the time."}
{"text":"Nice Fish Shack.   Cool spot to come sit by the lake, or drive you boat up to the dock after a hard day of boating.  The quality of the fried seafood was really good, Some of us got plain batter, I got salt and pepper, and other got grilled.   All were done really well.  I got the flounder plate and it was a lot of food for a really good price.  It also was really delicious. (But don't get the rice pilaf though, get something else)  I also tried the battered shrimp and it was awesome too.     If you have a hankering for seafood and beer, come here and get your fix."}
{"text":"Came here with a soon to be groom later today for a last lunch! Outside bar was really cool near the water, good music and the bartender Barrie was great! I loved the ribeye tacos and tried the chicken tacos as well...no one was disappointed with their food. Loved this place"}
{"text":"Riverview off Wilkinson, thanks for your billboard otherwise we wouldn't have discovered you and so glad we did!  New to CLT, went to Botanical Garden in Belmont, discovered you enroute and tried you on the way back to uptown.  Delicious mussels, fab crab cake, terrific service, lovely setting and live music (Sunday afternoon).   We will talk about you and, return!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We went here with a table of 10-15 and they were awesome. Sometimes when a group that big just strolls in a restaurant struggles to keep up but they took it completely in stride.  I was so impressed by the food, the service and the atmosphere. This is my go to spot to stop when I'm on the lake. I highly recommend the crab stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer and the tuna tacos!"}
{"text":"Steamed clams with chopped up hot dogs on top. Classy. Too bad this place is so close to home and I'll never go back."}
