{"text":"I wanted to give this a higher rating, I really did.  This was the first time I have been here since the remodel.  It took me awhile to go because I REALLY loved Metropolitan Cafe, was there on their last night before they closed for the remodel, and was very upset that it was changing.  I was worried that the atmosphere might be too casual, but it was nice.  We had a booth where we could look out to W. 6th.  The atmosphere was great, and it was very crowded.  However, we were able to get a table without a reservation.    I was happy looking at the menu, to see there were decent entrees available, and that the Wedge Salad remained on the menu.  Love the Wedge Salad!  I will preface my food review, and say that our service WAS great.  Drinks: I had an X-Rated (rum, pineapple juice, and something else.)  It was ok.  They could probably expand their martini menu a bit, but their beer and wine selection seemed extensive.  Appetizer:  Calamari.  I really enjoyed this.  It had some type of thai sauce on it, and it was truly delicious.    Entree:  My boyfriend had the chicken.  Huge portion, he said it was good.  Now, here is where my disappointment sunk in.  I ordered the scallops.  I am not a cheap person by any means, but when you are paying over $20 for scallops, there best be MORE THAN 3 on the freaking plate!  I can get good scallops for about the same price at Pier W, and they give you 5!!!  It was served with risotto, and I did like that.  The scallops themselves were good, but overloaded with salt!  Now, I like salt, I enjoy it, even though I know how bad it is for me.  I had 3 glasses of water before bed because of all the salt.  (Maybe it's better there were only 3 scallops on the plate, for that reason alone).  Dessert:  Since my significant other doesn't like chocolate (!!!), I always try to order something we can share, so I went with the Pineapple Upside Down cake.  It was....ok.  Just ok.    I don't think one bad entree will deter me from going there again, as I could try other entrees on the menu, and try a different dessert as well.  For now though, i have to give this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"Let me first say thank you to the staff and fellow patrons for making us feel welcome and by us I mean 10 New York Jet fans the night before the Jet v. Browns game.  Our server was great, very friendly and helpful with the menu and there always seemed to be someone there attending to us...maybe b/c they saw a big bill in the making.    I had a personal pizza some chicken and pesto concoction and it was quite good....a bit oily, but tasty for sure.  Devoured the entire thing.  Two words....CHRISTMAS ALE....what a delicious beer that is supposedly brewed down the street and has much more alcohol content than normal beer!  Score.  Lastly....desert.  I can't even put into words how ridiculously great the Nutella alcoholic milkshake was, I wouldn't do it justice.  I didn't even want desert b/c I was so full yet I managed to take this thing down in no time.....felt awful after, but it was worth it.  Some guys tried the Whopper milkshake too and said it was great too but nothing compares to the Nutella one....nothing.    Very affordable place, considering it is a nice place and in a great location.  Our bill for 10 guys eating appetizers & dinner, drinking a lot, & desert was about $375 I think, including tip and tax.    THank you Metro...the New York Jet fans left very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out Metro Bar and Kitchen for happy hour because I heard it's not only awesome food and drink specials, but it's also a really cool scene.   I'm thinking I went on an off night -- I mean it was a cold, snowy Wednesday night in the CLE.  So I'm not ruling out Metro just yet.  We tried to order drinks from the Happy Hour menu, but alas, we were not in the Happy Hour section.  Note:  I could reach out my arm and touch said section, BUT we were not given the choice to move.  Okay, fine, I can deal since it was still Ladies' Night and I could still get a $5 Flirtini.  The waiter was a bit rude, and therefore tarnished the rest of my experience.  However, he could not ruin the food -- it was that good.  I'm on a health kick; with a wedding four months away, I really need to cut back on the carbs.  So I ordered the Metro burger with turkey and swapped out the bun for a lettuce wrap.  It was delish, as were the brussel sprouts with hazelnuts and pomegranate.  YUM.    I will definitely head back to Metro.  But I think I'm going to wait for the warmer months to take advantage of that swanky patio.  So, I guess I'll see you there... in about July."}
{"text":"Metro Bar gets an A for food and a C- for service. Went there this past Saturday to celebrate a birthday with a party of 10. The food was delicious, but near the end of our meal, our server seemed to stop caring. It was like since he knew he had a guaranteed tip with gratuity he just stopped serving us. Never offered dessert. Took us at least 30 minutes after we finished our meal to get our check...took 15-20 minutes to come back and collect it...and another 10 to run our card. They were busy, but not crazy. There was no apology, no offer to refill our drinks or for dessert.   I'll go back because I love hanging on their patio in the summer...where I have always had great service. I'm hoping we just hit our server on a bad night."}
{"text":"We went last week for a friend's birthday.  The metro was a very good martini- mixed well and the alcohol meshed together nicely with the juices. The sangria was premixed and they only used white wine- it was more juice than wine.  The presentation of the absinthe was nicely done with the water and spoon.  The basic price of 8.75 for a drink is a bit high for the juice ridden sangria, but well worth it for the poppy.  The food was relatively all right, I ordered what the waitress recommended. We ordered truffle chips (7.50)- overcooked and brown.  The balsamic vinegar sauce and the blue cheese didn't mesh well together- something is missing to tie the ingredients together.  The basic pizza (10) was good- not the best, but good.  We ended up trying the blue cheese crusted boneless short ribs (17-18)- it was very heavy on the blue cheese.  The blue cheese overpowered the ribs, all I tasted was the blue cheese and a salty sauce.  The fried risotto patty was very good-possibly one of best I have had.  It was perfectly crusted and crispy.  It would have tasted even better without the ribs or blue cheese.  I don't think I will get that again.  The atmosphere is busy and amazing.  I ran into so many people I knew and struck up random conversations with strangers.  I like how the bar sits lower toward the ground near the back of the restaurant.  I also like the modern fireplace in the back near the drink tables.  The glass facade allows a nice view of W.6th and St. Clair, which is nice- We got a view of all the people going down for Pauly D. @ the Tequila Ranch haha :)  The restaurant is modern, yet warm and comforting.  The service was great at first, but it slowly started to slow as night went on.  We waited a while for drinks, food, and the check to come around.    Bottom line:  Expect to spend a fair amount of money for pretty good drinks and mediocre food.   Maybe I picked out the wrong dishes and appetizers to get- I'll try their mac and cheese or burgers next time."}
{"text":"Metro is now closed and being turned into a Bar Louie.  So sad.  No more truffle chips and milk shakes.  So long, non-chain bar!"}
{"text":"Had a dinner here the other night with a friend, a couple drinks and appetizers.  Truffle (oil) infused chips, crab cakes and a raucous bar.  It's somewhere between shishi and a sports bar, with a mix of dark woods, brasses and LCD screens.  Price point is lower, suggesting an orientation towards a younger crowd.    Service was mediocre; moderately attentive, but a tad brusque.  Had fun with my party - and that's what matters.  For me, it's a place to bar-hop, perhaps, but not a place to breathe in ambiance.  3.5, given the price point; rounding down due to the plethora of alternatives just around the corner."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about our most recent dining experience at Metro! We went on a Monday and therefore had the opportunity to sit at one of the few tables with 4 large, red velvet chairs that were ultra comfy. We ordered the Tuna Wonton and Lobster bisque as an appetizer and they were out of the world, talk about knock your socks off! For our entrees we both ordered the Filet with the potato gratin, the filet was outstanding the gratin was not bad, just wish it was a bit more creamy. The service was outstanding, our server was one of the best servers we have had in quite some time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Let me first say it has been awhile that I went to this place so technically it would be my first time since they changed the outlook of it as well as their menu. I was a bit disappointed by their limited items of seafood at least that's what they had in their previous menu. I ordered the salmon and it was just bland. The atmosphere is inviting and hip. If you ask if I would visit again, I would but not for dinner. Probably a place for happy hour"}
{"text":"They have done a great job with the remodeling and reinvention of the menu. The restaurant is reminiscent of NYC or Chicago urban style restaurants that are energetic and lively.   We went on the second night it was open and was seated promptly in the backroom where the fireplace and faux oil paintings are hanging on the ceiling. The ambiance is lively and spacious in the main room with the exposed kitchen, bar with numerous flat panel tvs and lounge area with large red comfy looking chairs. The backroom where we were seated was of a quieter ambiance. The service was excellent, with various staff including the the owner coming by to check on everything. They were very friendly and attentive; not sure if it was due to recently opening, but hope it continues.   Now onto the good stuff...   Drinks: Great draft selection (15 or so on tap), they have Goose Island Pere Jacques on tap!!! Very well done my friends, well done!!  Great selection of martinis, including various fruity and herb infused flavors. Plus \"Adult Milkshakes\"! (Get your mind outta da gutter) Didn't get one, but they sounded tasty. (Nutella: Vanilla ice cream, Nutella, Frangelico and Hazelnuts; sounds almost sinful to put Nutella and alcohol together)   Food: Pat La Frieda burgers here in Cleveland?!?!?! Yes you heard right! Sourced from KY and previously exclusively sold in NYC is available in Cleveland. Same purveyors who make the \"Black Label\" burger for $26 seen on \"No Reservations\". Anyhow I got the \"California Dreamin'\" Burger ($7.90, gotta represent my home state). It has watercress, avocado relish, jack cheese and tomato. Delicious! Juicy, cooked to perfection and fresh ingredients. The side of hand-cut fries with \"malt mayo\" had just the right amount of kick and flavor.  My companion got the Marinated Amish Roasted Half Chicken ($13.90!). They aren't kidding with it being a Half Chicken. Definitely a large portion cooked to perfection! Juicy on the inside with crispy skin on the outside. The herb mashed potatoes are awesome! I love my potatoes to have some punch, and these had great intensity of flavor of garlic and various herbs.   I look forward to heading back to try other tasty options. All the entrees are below $22!! $5.90 for a burger! I consider this a bargain if the rest of the menu is as good as the food we got. Other tasty sounding options: Ribeye, Scallops, Steak and Eggs, Ribs, fresh daily fish, brussel sprouts with hazelnut and pomegranate (interesting!). Sounds like they will have a nice large patio opening for the summer. They also have some great happy hour deals, daily drink specials and have late night food items as well. I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I have one question for you: Have you tried these burgers?! Because I'm not even hungry right now, but I'm drooling just thinking about them. Nom.   In my eyes, this was one smart restaurant remodel. Instead of competing with it's 5 star neighbors on the corners of St. Clair and W. 6th, Metro decided to reopen as a posh, modern new spot with a more laid-back, reasonably priced menu. Great happy hour deals, delicious sandwiches, burgers, apps and salads, and the coolest patio in the Warehouse District. This place attracts young business people after work like flies. And the nightlife folk keep the place buzzing Lionel Richie style, alllll night long!   You know how I was talking about those burgers? Good laaaawd! They are the juiciest, freshest tasting burgs eva! I'm not kidding you... Although I admit I'm no connoisseur. You can literally have a cook come over to your table, tell you when the beef came in, when they ground it fresh in house--hell, they'll even tell you what the friggin' cow ate before it got on your plate! I like to know what I'm eating, so that's a nice luxury that I wouldn't mind paying a lot for. Fortunately you don't have to here! If I can recall correctly, I think it's like $6-7 for a burger. That's unheard of at a nice, downtown restaurant.   The burgers aren't the only things on the menu that rocked my socks off. Shall I list off all the things I've tried that are delish? Well, OK...but we might be here for a while..  - Pretzel Bread sticks with homemade mustard & caramel dipping sauces (Heavenly) - Wasabi Tuna Wonton  - Fresh Truffle Chips (Oh...my...god..) - Wild Mushroom Sandwich (AWESOME veggie alternative!) - Homemade Milkshakes w/ booze!! (Seriously...just try one)"}
{"text":"mediocrity.  would better service help it?  i have no idea.    Hmmmm. I stopped in on a random weeknight to check out the relatively new Metro. The sparkly young lady at the hostess stand was most accommodating. And then it went progressively into a downward spiral.   We were seated in the lounge area of the bar, surrounded by 3 huge televisions showing various basketball games. There was no escaping the visual assault of bright colors and commercials. There are TV screens throughout the dining room as well, everywhere you look. I was wondering if this atmosphere could induce epileptic seizures like some video games can. Add in that the tinny music made me feel like I was in an 80's time warp.   After about 5 minutes, our server arrived and took our drink and appetizer order. And then we sat. And waited. And waited some more, until after some time, a young manager type brought over a now flat beer. \"These were sitting on the bar for a while, so I thought to bring them over\" he said. Ummmm... OK.   Ten minutes later our server came with our appetizer of the truffled chips. This was the highlight of the meal. They were very good and we did enjoy them, but we did not find any of the candied pecans in the mix that was described in the menu. He also took our dinner order - a burger and a salad. It appears they must only cook the burgers the way it eventually arrived, medium-well, as the temperature question was never asked. \"Eventually\" means almost half of an hour in this case.   My burger was good. La Frieda beef is used, and it's flavor is much better then generic ground beef. Just fatty enough, not drippy. The side of fries did not include the malt mayonnaise that, again, was made mention in the menu. (That's twice now... I see a pattern....)  The Wedge Salad had no ingredients missing, but was decidedly bland. The \"onion crostini\" served with the salad was stale.  Even though we were having a meal, there were no water glasses on the table.   We had finished eating and watched our server buzz around the dining room, oblivious to our table. After a solid 15 minutes of waiting for our check, I roamed the dining room in search of anyone who could get our check to us. I spotted the manager, and asked him to have our server bring it, which he immediately did. We waited some more, put our coats on, and the server appeared to clear our plates. I asked him for the check again, and he proceeded to go get it, but not before asking asking us if we were really finished, and taking the time to get another table's order. (Dude, we have our coats on, and had to ask the manager for our bill....)   So there you have it. OK food, marginal at best service. I may give it another try, but too many better options abound in the Cleveland food scene.   Carry on."}
{"text":"I want to love this place. I really, really do. I can walk there, the food is really good and the drinks are amazing.  But the service.  The service is just so... weird.  The place was renovated to be affordable, trendy, and appeal to a younger crowd but I'm not sure that the wait staff got the memo because they all seem uptight and formal.  Now, I don't mind uptight and formal service when it's good, but it's not. Which brings me back to just weird.  We've had a lot of good meals there - they have good steaks, great burgers, and the short ribs are heavy but great.  If they could just get the service right, it would be 4 stars for me."}
