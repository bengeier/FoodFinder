{"text":"This place doesn't get anymore authentic. They have Classic Mexican that taste great."}
{"text":"I love this place. This place is a real hidden gem in Las Vegas, it's my go to spot for an authentic Mexican meal. The entire menu is outstanding and very affordable. The people are great, very comfortable, homely atmosphere, very welcoming. Soups, tacos, gorditas, huarache, tortas, flan....everything here is great. Highly recommended.  Everything that I've had here has been great but so far my favorite bites have been the enchiladas Pollo De Mole and consomme loco.  The enchiladas pack a punch of flavor with the mole and the consomme loco is just a great example of less is more."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The employees are always really nice and the food is amazing!  The chicken soup tastes like something grandma would make.  The enchiladas are rich and delicious.  The flan--homemade and everything flan should be.  Everything on the menu is awesome!  Great prices, but it's cash only."}
{"text":"Stopped by to cure my hangover hunger :) on a Sunday afternoon. I live in the area  but never been to this hole-in-the-wall yet so I was kind of intrigued after seeing review about this place in LV Weekly.  Ordered few tacos and sope and quesadilla. All was good but I'd like to come back and try more stuff to see what's the hype.  It should be all good because place was packed (although it is very small  inside)."}
{"text":"Food was ok only came here because we seen aaron sanchez  ( food network ) and his taco trip show was here we had the pambazo . It's OK not the best in the  world."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexian place in town.  They have so many optins.  Go with the chicken mole verde.  It is delcious.  Enchiladas rock, the alambra is good too.   Shrimp cocktail isnt that great though- I've had much better."}
{"text":"The food is made to order and tastes great.  It's a small place and based on the food alone, is probably busy all the time."}
{"text":"So good , there is no better food. My mom LOVES everything on the menu. I recommend the millanesa and alambre. BTW my mom loves their tostadas"}
{"text":"Mmmm. It's been many years since I was last in Mexico City, so when we randomly wandered in here fresh of the plane, I got excited. The service was wonderful, the prices were reasonable, and the food! It took me right back to Cuernavaca."}
{"text":"I don't get over to the east side often so Los Antojos has been on my to try list forever, but I finally had the opportunity to give it a try. Walking in, I was overwhelmed by the menu. I wanted one of everything. I settled on the enchiladas with mole. I don't find it too often outside of my visits to Mexico so I had to try it. The husband ordered something else that sounded delicious. I don't recall now what it was because there was a mix up in the kitchen and they served two orders of mole. It mattered none to us. No sharing needed. Although, the mole sauce was bit too bitter.   When I find myself in the area I'd seek our Los Antojos again and try another menu item."}
{"text":"The DEA needs to raid this place because it truly addictive. Love the chicken soup. Being a Gringo I would have never thought Chicken, avacado, and celantro would ever be teamed together. WINNER. Tried the Pambazo but it was overshadowed by the OMG LUCY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE Cubano. It is the Best Sandwich in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I been frequenting this place for the last 6 years. The food is really authentic Mexican Food. The place is not the fanciest nor the biggest, however, the flavor, quality and portions of the food makes it an 5 star rating. I live 45 minutes from here, but the food makes the trip wort it."}
{"text":"Fantastic D.F style Mexican food. Been going here for years, very consistent good quality food. The quesadillas are delish! Also, the chicken soup is so simple and perfectly filling. Love this place. Small space definitely worth the wait if there is one."}
{"text":"This place has one of my favorite dishes in this town. And while I know everything they put out in this place is not perfect, the consistent perfection of this one dish garners them five stars in my world.                    CONSOMMÉ LOCO  Consommé is a clarified chicken stock. And theirs is a complex concoction served with chicken pieces (white meat only), rice, cilantro, onion, and avocado. And I add a few hearty squeezes of lime for good measure.  It's soulful and simple and demands attention.    I always get the soup and a carne asada quesadilla. The deed fried quesadilla is always perfectly seasoned and crisp. The gooey cheese and crispy pocket puts those (healthier, lighter) quesadilla to shame.   Aside from that amazing soup and the delicious quesadillas, they are one of the few places that has a deeply interesting and flavorful sauce on their chilaquiles.    I've tried their tacos and a few other plates and been satisfied. Not overwhelmed, but satisfied. I would not recommend their tacos when there are so many other great things to try at Antojos.   That said, I have such respect for the consistency and quality of the food coming out of this place. I'm always surprised that they are not more crowded. Oh, there won't be many open tables when you get there for lunch, but you'll order and be served very quickly.   I don't know if this place is still considered a hidden gem since it has been lauded and discussed in a number of publications. But it is one of the rare gems in this valley. And I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Huaraches with carne asada are the best food to eat from here.But if you have a large party I wouldn't recommend dining here because it is very small. Very fast service and great customer service"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch.  Found this place in the book \"Eating Las Vegas\" along side Michelin star restaurants.  Small, clean place with pictures of their plates and hand written specials on the wall. I'm not a mexican food guy so I was a little intimidated but the guy who took my order was very nice, spoke English and was able to make helpful suggestions.  I tried their Mole de pollo as recommended by fellow yelpers. Wow! Though I never had mole before, good food is good food and the mole was delicious. Chicken was tender and moist. I mopped the plate clean with the steaming hot tortillas that come with the plate. They had a drink called \"Mango water\". Amazing. So good. Refreshing and not too sweet. I complimented the mole as I was leaving and as we talked about the food I could tell that he took a lot of pride in his food. I will definitely be back. Viva la Mexico!"}
{"text":"It's a tiny hole in the wall in a sleazy shopping center, but wow, that torta was so delicious. For the first time ever, I tried a torta. I always passed them up since I figured a sandwich is a sandwich, but I was wrong. The torta is mainly a hot sandwich with different type of fillings than what an American sandwich would have. I had the Cuban. It had both roasted pork and ham with melted Mexican type of cheese, tomatoes and maybe guacamole. It was so good and I've been back to have it again. Now I'm hooked on tortas. My Mexican friend, who had been there, told me to try the pierna. It was good but not as good as the Cuban. I tried their rice, beans and tacos. They were only OK. The service is friendly and good. I definitely will be back for my Cuban torta fix!"}
{"text":"I've only had one item on the whole menu. El consome loco... I am sure everything else must be just as good but I can't come here and not order the consome. One day I will attempt to eat something else... Or maybe not."}
{"text":"I first encountered cochinita pibil at the Taco Bus in Tampa, Florida, and I've been searching for it ever since. Although there is a version of it at Border Grill at Mandalay Bay, I wanted something a little less upscale, and when I read about Los Antojos on Yelp, I couldn't wait to try it.  My husband loves cochinita pibil even more than I do, so he ordered the plate lunch. For less than $8, he got a platter of tasty pork (seasoned with citrus and achiote) with the traditional picked onions, along with rice, beans, and tortillas. I had two cochinita pibil tacos, which were like the small street fare I expected; and a small bowl of the consomme loco, which is a simple chicken, rice, and cilantro soup topped with avocado. Although the soup was tasty, next time I think I'll stick with the tacos, and maybe try one of the others listed on the menu -- the ham and pineapple (jamón y piña) sounds intriguing.  The restaurant itself doesn't look much different from the dozens of similar strip-mall establishments located throughout the city, but the variety of menu options -- especially the inclusion of the aforementioned cochinita pibil (did I say how much I love it?) -- make this \"hole in the wall\" one worth visiting."}
{"text":"Flautas are a must have.....mmmmm good. Nice people Great food... that's a winning combo!"}
{"text":"I was visiting LV for a conference and coming from CA I'm used to good Mexican food. When the valet at my hotel told me the place was goooood and to bring him back a surprise I wasn't worried at all.  The place is divey for sure, but it's great! I had the chilaquiles (a personal favorite) and they didn't disappoint.  It was so good I brought 5 CA colleagues back with me for dinner the same day. They were pleased with their meals as well - we all cleaned our plates.  One person said the tortilla soups was \"out of this world\" and another said the beans were nice a light - it's so easy to make them heavy.  It's in a strip mall and easy to miss, but make the U-ie and try again - it's worth it!"}
{"text":"it was okay.. nothing more.  the place is really cramped with tiny plastic chairs (like in a classroom) and small tables to match.  this didn't bother me much because i'm tiny too.  the tables weren't sticky either, so that's a plus.  we went at around noon on a wednesday and there were 3 people sitting there eating or watching the olympics on the television.  the guy at the counter was really nice and spoke more english than i expected.  he explained to us what certain things on the menu were and poured us two cups of water.  from your tables, you can see the kitchen right behind the counter and it looks really big and clean.. so one star for that.    i took my mom here and we ordered two tacos and the highly recommended consomme loco (i got a junior size).  all together it costed around 6 dollars and some change.. so that wasn't that bad.  the tacos were the size of a toddler's hands (super tiny) and according to my mom, they were nothing special.  the consomme loco came in a medium sized bowl with pieces of cilantro and onion floating around.  there was shredded chicken and mexican rice in the bottom of the clear broth.  now lets talk about the taste.. it tasted almost exactly like slightly watered down chicken flavored top ramen.  i don't know if it's that top ramen is really good, or this soup is really bad but i didn't really think it was as good as other people said it was.  after eating that soup, i'm left with a really dry and thirsty taste in my mouth.  even though i got the junior size bowl, it was actually really filling and i had to force myself to spoon down the last few drops.  for filling me up, i'll give it another star.    overall, the food wasn't great but at least it wasn't nasty.. i grew up with a lot of mexican friends whose mothers made delicious soup for us all the time, so that's what i was expecting when i came here.  it's not a place i would come to again.   p.s. cash or debit only"}
{"text":"Bookmarked this place after seeing their PAMAZO TORTA listed in an issue of LV Weekly, as one of the Top 10 Mexican Meals of the city. I don't remember the ranking, but the description was enough to motivate me to seek this place out.  I ordered the torta and a mushroom quesadilla, based on another review. The quesadilla is damn delicious when you actually get something in your bite that isn't just cheese. Wish the mushrooms were more plentiful, or more evenly distributed, because once you get that perfect bite, there's no going back.  But back to that torta. To say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. Even digging in right after I received my order, the bread was soggy with grease to the point that it was difficult to eat. I know better than to expect something healthy when I eat Mexican, but this was overkill. What was most disappointing was the flavor: there really wasn't any. I could tell I was eating potatoes, and in addition to the grease, I stumbled upon some crumbles that let me know my meal contained chorizo, but nothing had flavor.  I added salt, I added salsa, but there was no perking up this dish.   I don't know how this torta made anyone's list of great foods, or if I simply received something other than what they usually serve- but this is not something I'd care to eat again."}
{"text":"I'll trek across town for this mole again, for sure!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday for lunch for the first time. Small hole on the wall type restaurant with 5 small tables and a counter. Employees are super friendly and responsive. I had the consume loco and the tacos cochinita pibil. Both were very delicious! The soup starts off a little bland but throw in a few scoops of green salsa, a couple of the red and a squeeze of lime and now we're talking!"}
{"text":"Drove over 30 mins just for this . Food was old service was great will be here again forsure !"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place on KNPR I decided to come down, with my best Mexican friend in tote (just in case I needed translation on the menu), to try this place out.  I do not recommend using Google maps to locate this place, instead look out for it on the southeast corner of Sahara and Eastern.  Upon arriving, it does not look like much, and at first glace I thought I had arrived upon a venue that did not sell food at all, but after reading the words \"taco\" and \"enchilada\" written on the glass window, I breathed a sigh of relief.  We entered and saw the crammed 9 table (plus bar top seating on the side) seating area with a counter top right behind.  After trying my best to decipher the Spanish on the menu (with the help of my friend), I settled on the chicken mole enchilada (~$8) and the tortilla sopa (~$5).  My friend, who had also brought her roommate, got the milanesa (~$10) and the chicken flautas (~$8).  After ordering we sat at one of the tables stuffed in the corner to await our meal.  On the table was an open container with what appeared to be some type of hot sauce, typical of Mexico City style fare, according to my friend.  Our meal arrived complete with rice, beans, and a few tortilla chips right on the plate.  My mole, which can be explained as a curry-like sauce containing chocolate, was rich, sweet and savory.  I tried some of the flautas, topped with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and queso.  Crispy on the outside with soft, juicy chicken on the inside.  The milanesa, according to my friend was good too.  The tortilla sopa was savory and sour from the lime and sour cream.  Definitely a must try.  The questionable sauce in the open dish was, in-fact, hot sauce, chipotle hot sauce to be exact.   All in all I gave this place 5 stars because the price is decent, the food is good, and the staff is friendly.  I will definitely come here again, possibly to try out the other goodies on the menu.  I recommend this place to anyone who is adventurous and loves good Mexican food at decent prices.  This is not a place for those who are expecting a fine-dining, or even a Chili's-style dining experience, nor the obsessive compulsive clean.  **CASH ONLY**"}
{"text":"i would give this place 5 stars if they would spend some extra money to fix it up. not much eye appeal but very clean. it was rated one of the best hidden places in vegas by npr critics.  the food is amazing at take out prices. oh and they didnt accept cards a few months ago so check before you go"}
{"text":"I have only been here twice, but so far it is the best Mexican fare I've had in Las Vegas.  They had a good chicken mole taco, a satisfying consommé, and authentic Mexico City offerings like the huarache.   My only complaint was the limited and undersized chairs and tables.  I am not sure if their usual clientele are umpa lumpas or elementary school children, but some adult sized tables would be an improvement."}
{"text":"This place is the business! best MEXICAN  restaurant on the east side!!! although i don't ever dine in (just because it so small, and a place like this you wanna take your time and savor every bite!.....that great!....and i don't want people giving me the evil over  over a table). Its so worth it. I recommend the Hurache and Alambres but everything on the menu is great thats just my personal FAVORITE."}
{"text":"Rumor has it the flautas are amazeballs. Let's see...  The above comment was my check in at Los Antojos.  The excitement ended with that sentence. It wasn't good at all. A Flauta, at least where I come from, is pretty simple. Take everything that a taquito and/or rolled taco is and instead of using a corn tortilla use a flour tortilla. Los Antojos uses Corn tortillas making these not flautas, but rolled tacos. They were pretty good, but not at all what I was expecting. I also wasn't crazy about the take out presentation. Instead of topping off the fake flautas with sour cream and lettuce they were all packaged seperately. I apprecate the consideration of soggy fake flautas, but one thing I love is the pre-made orchaestration of my rolled tacos and/or flautas. I accept the fact that the middle one may be a 3-napkiner, that's okay. Don't make me construct my own lunch though.   Given the reviews I was disappointed, but I only tried one thing on the menu. Not sure I will be back to try another. I will say the place was packed for lunch and several people were eating soup, so maybe I should go a different route if there is a next time."}
{"text":"Saw a previous review of someone unimpressed with the Consume Loco and was prompted to write a rebuttal. Perhaps they forgot, or did not know, to add the lime and salsa to taste? All my childhood summers were spent in La Capital and nearby Cuernavaca, this is authentic as it gets. I even get flashbacks of my aunts with every bite. I dare you name a place in Vegas that comes anywhere close."}
{"text":"Whole in the wall  off the strip  small and ususally crowded (which means its good)  everything in this place is good. everything. try it, you will love it.   I ate at the Wynn buffet the night before...I paid $36 at the Wynn...for food that lacked flavor and personality. At Los Antojos I paid $12 for food that is made fresh, with love, with flaovr, perosnality, just amazing.   5 stars."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST place in town to get mole. Hands down.   A friend of mine, who is from Juarez originally, and is married to a guy who's from Mexico City, turned me onto this place. I was craving mole and Yelping desperately one day at work. And she was like, \"Um, I've got you on this,\" and proceeded to order over the phone and picked the food up and brought it back to our office. I took one bite of the mole enchiladas and immediately fell in love. The depth of the diverse spices, the chocolate undertones, the intensity of flavor and warmth - oh. my. god.  Words are not enough to describe this mole. Nothing can suffice. You can't go to Leticia's, Lindo Michoacan, nor Viva Zapata's and get this quality of mole. This legit tastes like they've kidnapped somebody's Nana, or at least her recipe, and make magic daily. This is the very best mole I have ever had in my life, and unless you have someone making it for you from scratch, this is - no doubt - the next best thing. RUN to this mole."}
{"text":"I love this place. One of my favorite Mexican spots in the city. Every dish I've tried is excellent. I highly recommend if you're looking for very good authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Everytime I pass by this place I have to stop and grab a bite. The consommé is simply made with a generous portion of chicken, avocado, and rice. The flavor is savory, and comforting inducing feelings of home. It is absolute perfection! I suggest ordering the largest size because you'll be craving more!"}
{"text":"The food in this joint is based on street food you find in Mexico city. It's not fancy Lindo Michoacan type where the waiter makes you guacamole at your table . It's a small place, so don't come here expecting great seating."}
{"text":"Go for the tamarindo drink. That was pretty good.   Tacos were somewhat dry. Mole was less than I expected, although I have to say that not too many places do mole. Consomme was pretty good, but it's chicken broth, avocado and strips of chicken. It's gonna be good! I had the taquiza. The rice and beans were awesome. The taco's different meats were just not too impressive. I tried the Suadero, Tinga, Al Pastor, Mole, and Tripa. Their meats are not juicy enough for me. The tortillas here were perfect. They were soft and fresh. Everything was really fresh, but the culinary desire for more leads me to rate them a three-star. Even their white onion and cilantro could have been more finely chopped.  Their chicken enchiladas came with mole. I have had many great moles. This mole was not a great one. It was a good one.   I lived in Mexico City, D.F. The tacos I had there were absolutely mindblowing. People would stand around taco stands and they would give you consomme as well. The animal fat would serve as the grease for the backdrop of flavorful meat for each taco. The toppings such as cilantro and onions were finely finely chopped. The grill that they used were the ones similar to the ones being used at Tacos El Gordo, even though TEG is Tijuanan style.  At Los Antojos, I feel that the execution of the food could have been so much better and reading all the reviews, I had high hopes for this place. Yes, perhaps some may say that I'm harsh, but if they advertise a regional food, and certain people go there for that regional food, that food should reach or exceed the standards. If this were in Mexico, it would have been one of the least busiest stalls in even areas like Tacubaya.   It is possible that the person cooking my food was an employee instead of the mama other people mention in their reviews. Thus, I will definitely try to come back when the mama is there."}
{"text":"I like this place because of the \"hole in the wall\" atmosphere and it's family owned.  The reason I return over and over is because of the chili rellenos. They make it right on point here and the sauce is seasoned and mild. (** = Must try)  PROS: Chili Rellenos**              Bottled Coke              Lengua Torta              Chicken Consomme**  CONS:  Carne asada meat is on the tough side               Loud TV"}
{"text":"If I had the option to put no stars I would. This is by far the worse Mexican restaurant I have ever been too! Nice staff but terrible tasting food and very hot small place. Again I can not stress on how terrible the food was. I went with friends, family, children included and no one was satisfied. Try at your own risk..."}
{"text":"OMGGGGG food is awesome!! The cashier girl is very sweet and kind, and I guess was the owner eating at one side of the counter next to the cashier was very nice person too, we eat guaraches and gorditas de chicharron, piña water and even order more gorditas to go!!! Lol, what a great food this place have, i will comeback for sure, and i will recommend this place to may friends and family cause is a hidden jewel on Las Vegas and people need to know about this place!!! I will get everybody names next time i go there, jezzz i even like the quiet guy with glasses who clean the tables was very kind too"}
{"text":"Best garnacha place that it has food from Mexico City. Everything is delicious. My favorite disches: Quesadillas, Pozole, Chilaquiles and Guarache Space is little."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last five years. I live on the other side of town on Blue Diamond in Fort Apache. However, every time I feel like In a mood for some good authentic Mexican food, I drive all the way here (yes they are that good). They serve the best Alambre in town. The place is not the fanciest, but if you were able to look past that you would not mind the good food."}
{"text":"Finally! Mexican food with SOUL.....with 2 strikes(Casa Don Juan, and Las Islitas) I guess third time's the charm...  Los Antojos does Mexican food typical of Mexico City and they do it pretty good! Inside is very modest with simple tables and chairs and pictures and signs of different dishes they offer. Sorry, you won't find Quesadillas that the general American public is familiar with, nor will you find Burritos here....you have been warned.  We ordered some Tacos-Tripa, Lengua, Suadero, Cochinita Pivil, and Mole de Pollo. We also got the Consomme Loco, Quesadilla de Rajas and a Huarache de Asada. I also got an Horchata-Homemade, not from the machine/instant.  All of the tacos were good, but the standout was the chicken mole, just like mole should taste. The Consomme Loco is a perfect example of simple food done right, DO get this if you ever dine here! Our first spoonful of this soup, the lady behind our counter saw our smiles and said \"Como Su Casa\"(\"Just like home\") It did feel as if we were guests in her home as she and her husband always checked on us to see that everything was okay. The Quesadilla was different in a good way...deep fried masa stuffed with cheese and strips of poblano peppers with a crisp exterior. The Huarache was good, but the carne asada was a little tough. We shared a cup of Strawberries and Cream and a Peach Gelatina for dessert. Overall, a good dinner, and definitely worthy of a return visit. You never know if you'll run into Chef Alex Stratta-Yup, this is his spot for Mexican fare....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"I've never been one for Mexican food but this place has changed my mind. Most items seemed to be small plate-esque so I ordered two small looking items to get variety: sopes and quesadillas.  The cashier went out of his way to explain that the quesadilla wasn't the typical quesadilla but through the pictures I had figured as much.  It was smaller than what we typically expect and it was fried...still cheese filled and amazing.  The sopes was a corn shell with beans lettuce and sour cream on it.  They had other varieties but went with vegetarian.  Both items were under $3 which makes for a cheap lunch.  They also offer soda pop in the old retro glass bottles which is kind of cool.  Now, why I almost take away a star.  A man walked in to apparently try and sell customers some items...meanwhile the cashier/maybe owner/manager locks the door.  Maybe I am just paranoid but it felt like they were trapping us in there.  There just seemed to be a lot of looks being shot around the room and it was freaking me out.    If I am in vegas again I would surely stop in but mayhaps take it to go. But seriously, amazing food!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place on Yelp Talk Vegas and thought I'd give it a try for lunch today.  It's located in an older, ethnic area of Vegas that has a large Hispanic population, so I thought I was on the right track.  I was excited as I pulled into the parking lot.  I couldn't wait to get inside and try it out.  The restaurant is small with about 4 tables for 16 people and counter seating for another 8-10 people.  It sounds like a lot, but it's crammed into a small area where chairs are back to back....very tight space.  The menu is pretty extensive, but I found it shocking that they don't have Burritos on the menu......WHAT??!!!  One of my favorite dishes and they don't have it.....oh well, I didn't give them a strike for that.  I saw that they had the bottled Mexican Orange Soda that I L-O-V-E, so I bought a bottle with the meal.  I opted for an Asada Torta & a Cheese Quesadilla (it sounds redundant & I hate saying it, but that's what was on menu).....thought I'd try two items because I was hungry and I wanted to get a good feel for their food.  The tables have the standard Mexican Red & Green Salsa on the table for your convenience....homemade, which is a plus.  When the food came out, I was kind of disappointed with the size of the Torta, but it's about quality not quantity, so I won't dock them for that.  They also brought out a small bowl of pickled peppers, almost like Italian Giardiniera peppers....cool, I love those.  However, the Asada was very tough and bland....Strike 1.  It was pretty flavorless....so I had to add a lot of the pickled peppers & hot sauce to make it palatable....Strike 2.  When they brought out the Quesadilla I was surprised to see that it was deep fried and looked like an Empanada (see pics).....looked better than it tasted though.  It too was bland!  Wow!  I couldn't believe it.....so again, I doused it with hot sauce and finished it because I was starving....Strike 3.  I really really really wanted to like this place, but the food was just too bland.....I tried 2 items and it was a bust.  Damn, that's too bad.  Will I come back?  I'm torn....maybe to try the Tacos and give them a chance for redemption."}
{"text":"The flan is still the best I've ever had. In general, it is the best in town for Mexican street food. It has been around for more than a decade because of its consistently high quality. However, it is not a cute gringo restaurant with a strolling mariachi band. It has about 25 seats with a tv blaring a Spanish language channel soccer game. The clientele are from the old sod, but everyone is welcome. I only wish they were closer to where I live."}
{"text":"The second time, for EVERYTHING, is never as good as the first. I am basing this on all of the experiences I have in my life on a plethora of matters (you can imagine).   Except Consume Loco. Consume Loco was perhaps fucking better the second time than the first. Motherfucker. Must be the exception to the rule or something.   Tried some tacos for the first time. Chose 'asada' for no particular reason; they were great. Flan and platanos fritos for dessert (again). Girlfriend had two cheese quesadillas. All of this, plus a complimentary plate of chips, for less than twenty five bucks (and that includes a GREATER THAN SYMBOL 25% tip).   Only at Los Antojos. I wish I lived closer so I can go more often, but I will continue to go way out of my way to enjoy this unbelievably delicious authentic Mexican cuisine. - E"}
{"text":"I've had Los Antojos bookmarked for quite some time and I had a show not too far away so I took the opportunity to remove a bookmark.  Based on recommendations from Yelp friends I read, the consommé was a no brain order.  I added two tacos to the order also, one pollo con mole and one al pastor.  Two things keep this from being a four star review.  The consommé was only lukewarm and should have been hotter.  The flavors were excellent, however.  The tacos were good but it was my mistake to order them at the same time I ordered the soup.  They sat there as I finished my soup.  This was my error.  When I return, I'll order like I would at a tapas place and enjoy each part while it's hot, hopefully, and then order the next dish.  The room is small and very pleasant.  I was surprised by the lack of customers because the parking lot was filled.  Someone pulling out gave me a spot.  There are so many places in this small plaza that I can see where parking would be an issue."}

And your sweet neighbor a coupla doors down that sells raspados -- definitely cool...  Can't wait to come back.    Cash only."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Mexican!  From tortas, to chilequiles to chorizo!  This is a must try!"}
{"text":"I had tried Los Antojos a couple of years ago after reading John Curtas go on about how great it was. A friend and I went and tried a bunch of different things, like huaraches, and consome loco and were not very impressed.  Fast forward 2 years and everybody I know has been to the restaurant and are raving about it. My friend and I decided to give it another chance. This was three weeks ago and I have been back at least ten times. This place is fantastic! I have been here for both breakfast and lunch, and I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've tried. For breakfast they offer a ton of choices and if nothing on the menu suits you, they can also whip something up. I tried eggs with chorizo and huevos rancheros, both come with different sides like beans, tortillas, bread, etc. My husband tried the borrego (lamb), it comes with a side bowl of consome (super, super rich), cilantro, onions and your choice of bread or tortilla. The owner assured him that with his meal he wouldn't need another meal all day. He was super happy with it, although it was a bit too rich for me. For lunch we've tried the tostadas de tinga (holy crap, they are incredible), tostadas de pollo (meh), sopa de tortilla, tampiqueña and pambazos. Pretty much everything was great. Also, all of their aguas frescas are made in-house.   Since the place is tiny it gets packed quickly, but you can get your food to go. My husband and I are quite obsessed!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the service and flan alone!!  The people here are amazing, and that flan is perfection.  We also tried:  Chicken Mole taco.  Excellent.  Nice flavor, and perfect consistency. Al Pastor Taco:  Also Excellent!  Flavorful, and HOT.  Very nice. Chicken Consume Soup: Excellent.  Fresh ingredients, great flavor. Tortilla Soup: This is just OK.  Not what I was expecting, but it's fine."}
{"text":"Los Antojos is a small little restaurant with amazing food. Located in a unpretentious area of Eastern and Sahara, Los Antojos does not disappoint. Bringing their food and culture from Mexico City, the restaurant has a friendly and laid back atmosphere with the best hurrache in town, my favorite is the alambre hurrache. With Familia P.Luche on the tv and families laughing Los Antojos is simply the best. All the food is excellent there. A must for locals and visitors :)"}
{"text":"The rice and beans are delicious.  I ordered the Taquiza taco plate (my choices: suadero, carnitas, pollo con mole, lengua) and besides the mole, none of the meats were distinguishable, they all looked more or less the same and even had a similar consistency and grill flavor.  If i come back I won't order tacos, as they were mostly flavorless.  I am not a huge mole fan, but it was tasty.  The salsas they serve alongside the food sucked:  one verde, one chipotle.  They both tasted unsalted and watered down.  Ive had better, more flavorful salsa from a can (Herdez brand).  The man at the register cared more about the movie on the TV than the customers. Taco y Taco is so much better?"}
{"text":"I think it's hilarious that someone would knock off an entire star for this place not having burritos. What we in the U.S. call \"burritos\" doesn't even exist in Mexico. That's an absurd Americanized thing.  That being said, I'll get on with the review, starting with the disclaimer that  THIS PLACE DOES NOT SELL MEXICAN-AMERICAN food.  People that are expecting nachos and burritos--sorry. Go to Taco Bell.  This place sells LEGIT, MEXICAN food that you would only otherwise find in MEXICO CITY, MEXICO. Phew. Okay, there.   AND, it's some of the best food I've had outside of Mexico City, to boot.  I haven't found any other place where I can order tortilla soup and get authentic tortilla soup. And where else would I be able to find mole verde?! MOLE VERDE. There is a huge variety of amazing food on the menu. I also saw them (WITH MY OWN EYES) start to make the food only after I had ordered it. I made awesome conversation with the woman who owns the place; sooo friendly, so chatty, always asking if we needed anything else. And at the end of the experience everything was fairly and moderately priced. To be honest, the food was so delicious that I would've paid double what I paid for that tortilla soup.   I WILL RECOGNIZE that the interior of the place isn't exactly charming. It's a little run down, with that faint layer of grease that usually coats well used restaurants. It's small and the tables are surprisingly close to the ground -- Buuuuuut I couldn't care less. The food makes up for anything that might be aesthetically displeasing as far as seating goes.   Try this place out. I could rave and rave about it. For days. That's what I'm doing now.   :]"}
{"text":"This mom and pop Mexican restaurant serves authentic fare.  We each ordered huevos rancheros which came with chips & salsa, rice, refried beans and warm tortillas.  The owner also served us complimentary cups of their delicious consomme loco which is a fat free chicken rice soup spiked with cilantro.  Neither of us could do this bountiful meal justice.  Our bill fell short of the minimum purchase requirement on our gift certificate so we ordered a slice of flan to go.  Later the same day we shared the flan which we found to be tasty, but a bit too heavy."}
{"text":"I was feeling a bit under the weather, so I was really craving some chicken soup. I mentioned this to my roommate and she immediately suggested that I go to Los Antojos and have their Consome Loco. I stopped by and immediately fell in love with this tiny place. It reminds me of the hole in the wall restaurants my mom and I love to go to. It's very cozy and the people are very nice.   The soup was very simple, yet delicious. Exactly what I needed while I was sick. It had chicken broth, shredded chicken, and avocado. It was perfectly seasoned and definitely hit the spot. This will be my go to place when I'm not feeling well. I would also love to stop by and try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I'm always impressed by the authentic taste of their food I'm also impressed by the freshness of the meat and quality of the Huaraches. The green sauce and red sauce carne Asada huarache is my favorite and the combination of both sauces makes the taste amazing. It doesn't take a while to take the food out considering they are cooking on a grill and fresh.  The tortillas are very soft, the salsas are homemade  with a kick and packed with flavor I also recommend the Cochinita Tacos I love the flavor of the meat and you can always put some habanero on top to rocket the flavor.   I also recommend the Pambazo it is made out of potato in a French bread with a red salsa on top of it. Yummi in my tummy.   The place is very little and sometimes can get really crowded but it is worth the wait. Staff is very friendly and always try to help you on any request you have, there's always parking around and the location is very family oriented. The prices are super cheap with 20 dollar you will feed 3 people easily. Yes I don't know either how they manage to have such cheap prices for such a great quality of food. Your money will always be worth it at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Dont let the little strip mall look keep you away. The food is excellent. This was my second trip there. The chicken mole is fabulous. So, so good. I had the chicken mole enchiladas and the mole tacos. The beans are fresh, and taste great with the queso fresco and the table salsas are good. Horchata was good as well. Not a strong cinnamon flavor which I like. Some places put way to much spice in their horchata, but this was good.   I knew I was in the right place with the novella on the tv and I was the only gringo in the joint :)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The caldo de pollo or consommé is amazing. The huaraches are soooo good, chilaquiles are amazing. I would definitely recommend getting the green salsa for both those dishes."}
{"text":"Cockroach (a baby one) on our served plate; this past Sunday, Dec 11, 16. We decide not to eat and leave.  I think that for this location, food is not cheap so they need to have a pest control.  I work with restaurants & I know when there's little cockroaches is because there's an infestation somewhere inside the restaurant.  Yeah I got my money back but we didn't have a single bite of our food.  so this is a very negative review. no stars at all."}
{"text":"Awesome...authentic street food. Pazole took me back!!!"}
{"text":"we came here on a sunday afternoon and ordered 6 tacos: (2 carnitas, 2 asada, and 2 tinga) and a horchata for 12.   - tacos comes with little meat. compared to el gordo (which although is a bit more expensive), they pack their tacos with more meat and has more flavor. - asada has too much fat. small pieces. - tinga and carnitas were nothing special (shredded beef and pork) - misfire. they sprinkle the cilantro and onions on. few tacos had alot and others had none! lol. - the mom hooked it up with a free refill of horchata :)!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for my lunch breaks at work and everything I've had is delicious. The only reason for one star knocked off is because the actual size of the resultant and eating and ordering area is kinda small and cramped so it makes it hard to really feel comfortable.   I always get the pambazo which is basically a potato sausage patty in a grilled bun soaked in some spicy liquid sauce and it's delicious. Super crispy and flavorful.   The steak hurrache is also a must try. The steak is tender and cooked just right and the sauces are super flavorful and not overpowering.   The flan is ok. Just a little to dense and bland for me.   They also have fresh homemade waters not those run in the machines with flavoring. They always have horchata and another flavor of the day. The horchata is good not too sweet. And I love the mango but they only have it once in awhile"}
{"text":"My boyfriend has taken me here five times in the past two months, and it's just amazing! He speaks Spanish, so it's easier for us to order, but they do speak English and their menu is in both languages. My favorite dish is the mushroom quesadillas- these are deep fried, not toasted, so it looks like an empanada. Every time we come the dish is prepared differently, which isn't a bad thing at all. The first time I got it the cheese was melted, but there was still small chunks of cheesy goodness, and the mushrooms were button mushrooms. The second time they still had button mushrooms, but they put in herbs and onions this time. Last night I got shitake mushrooms! Whhhaat??? It doesn't matter how many times they make it different, it's so good! My boyfriend always gets the large Loco soup (it's a chicken soup with rice and avocado slices) and a small chicken taco. We brought my mom last night and she tried everything- now she's converted. The desserts are to die for- we always get flan and fried plantains.They give you a very large slice of flan for about three dollars (try going later, when they are close to closing and they might just give you the rest of the flan they have) and the fried plantains are cooked to perfection, with sweetened condensed milk drizzled over for added sweetness. The best part is it is SO cheap! Two large Loco soup (I mean LARGE), two mushroom quesadillas, one chicken taco, one flan, and one fried plantains= 25$ before tip."}
{"text":"I'm always hesitant trying new taco shops, but a few of these reviews said it was good, so I decided to give it a try.  I came right before the lunch rush or something because I got super crowded after me. It's not a very large place but can seat maybe 15 people and everything was full. Also, when I was waiting for my food, I noticed I was the only non-Latino there... So that must mean it's pretty good... Right? The ordering took a few minutes because there was only one cashier and he was doing that and getting the food orders out.  I ordered the Chilaquiles, which comes with green sauce, rice, beans, and a choice of eggs or meat (I got the eggs). The chilaquiles itself was fine, there's a lot of sauce so it kind of makes the chips soggy. The tomatillo sauce has a little kick to it, but not too spicy at all. The beans were OK, the chips that are given with the dish seem to be a little stale, And the rice seems a little too salty.  They offer soda, the bottled kind and not the fountain kind, horchata, and I found this little odd...Capri sun.   The menu is not as extensive as I am used to, but this little place is worth it if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Small neighborhood restaurant with great food and service. We were even serenaded Friday evening by a visiting singer with his hauled-in sound system. Food was great!"}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall. I'm always the only white boy in the place. But you know it's good as many Mexicanos with their whole families arrive here regularly. Huge menu. The Hispanic guys at my place of work will vouch for the excellent consome loco, a fresh homemade chicken and rice soup served with avocado - hits the spot during cooler seasons. Normally they hate all mexican places in town but they like this one, so that's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Delightful, inexpensive Mexico City inspiried food.  The meat is well cooked, and has a flavor different from what you'd find at anything ending in *bertos."}
{"text":"I have been craving chilaquiles for months and couldn't find a place that sold them. My friend told me about this place and they were so so good... Everything was so fresh and the owner was so so nice! I will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"OK this is not some fancy place by any means but the food is the most authentic you will get this side of the border. I love the way they do the quesadilla, Pasole is amazing as the tortes. A must try little spot."}
{"text":"Un lugar de antojos estilo México. Puedes ir a desayunar o comer.. la sopa de tortilla un buen principio con buen sabor. Los huaraches, los plátanos fritos con media crema mmm mis favoritos."}
