{"text":"Expecting the worst isn't always bad, cuz you might be pleasantly surprised when it's good, and that's cool.

Usually, I avoid chain restaurants like the plague, especially a place like Marie Callendar's, cuz the food is hit or miss, and in my experience - more miss than hit.  However, this morning we were in a big group, and we are in Vegas, so I went with the flow.

I decided to order the California Benedict - poached eggs, fresh tomato, avocado on english muffin, hollandaise on the side, and crispy hash browns on the side.  I gobbled down the whole dang thing in a flash.  I remained quite satisfied the whole day even though we ended up having a late lunch.  We are gonna go back for breakfast at MC tomorrow morning as well...Since we missed dinner tonight, I can't wait!

The only weird point was, the waitress filled out the tip and total on the bill (extra 15%), since we had 14 people.  Her loss too, cuz the service was very good, especially considering we didn't call ahead for our 14 people...I was planning on tipping her extra."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good (for plain old, kinda boring American food), but WAYYYY overpriced.  I had a bowl of soup and a water for $8.  A bowl of soup!  That's crazy.

I'm not sure why people eat here!  If you just want plain jane American food, there are plenty of other places to go that won't empty your wallet."}
{"text":"Marie Callender's food is very predictable.  If you want a culinary adventure, go elsewhere.  If you want a chicken pot pie (and if you want one, you aren't really worring about the calories, fat or sodium content) and a slice of pie for dessert, it ain't bad.  What bumped this particular Marie Callender's up a notch was one of the waitresses.  I wish I'd bothered to get her name.  She's on the tall side, has hair long enough to put in a ponytail, and a New York accent.  She's perfect for this location and clientele, which runs to at least half senior citizens based on my visit.  She speaks loudly and clearly enough for everyone to hear her, is amazingly efficient and alert, and does one heck of a job selling the menu.  I'm not a demanding customer, but I do like to just sit back and watch a great waitress do her thing once in a while, and this gal was great."}
{"text":"Hooray for cozy, homey family restaurants with good comfort food. I like the relaxing family atmosphere, the friendly staff, and the menu that makes choosing your orders both easy (very well illustrated) and difficult (too many tempting items to choose from). Rand H. and I met here today for lunch. I ordered the pork loin and it was delicious - nicely seared, with savory mushroom sauce with crumbled gorgonzola and a hint of burgundy wine, all on a bed of piping-hot mashed potatoes. The side of steamed veggies and the hot cornbread complemented the dish perfectly. The pies were extremely tempting but after the filling meal, those are something to look forward to for my next visit(s)."}
{"text":"As Arik mentioned in his review, this place can make some good pies. If you're looking to pick up a pie or grab some dessert, this spot can be a good option.

As far as dining here for lunch or dinner, it's nuthin special. American cuisine with no real surprises. They have an ok salad bar & can have some good soups (cheesy potato!) on hand, depending on what they made that particular day.

They have just about zero vegetarian entree options on the menu. If you're a veg head dragged along to this place for a meal, you'll probably have to custom order some pasta with veggies or get creative in another manner. I'll be trying my best to avoid the place for meals, but meat-eaters might find something enjoyable..."}
{"text":"We didn't get to eat the food here but instead were able to buy the pies on Thanksgiving day.  Peach, Pecan, and Pumpkin were the selections for Thanksgiving dinner and none disappointed.

I was pleased with the way they had things for the TG day rush - a tent set up outside that was open on both ends.  Get your pies while walking through and then pay at the end which opened back up to the parking lot.

Now if I could have only eaten breakfast there..."}

{"text":"Marie Callendars! Ok...heres a story for ya!  I took a few friends to dinner the other night.  We went to Marie Calenders.  I ordered my desert which was an Ice Cream Sunday of some kind.  Took a spoonful..and YECH!  Nasty nasty Nasty!  Turns out when they made the whipped cream?  They used SALT instead of sugar!  Seriously!  Talk about nasty!  But wait thats not all!  As one of my friends was eating their dinner?  They found a surprise in their food.  A human fingernail!  Yep!  A fingernail!  Now we reported these issues to the manager.  He did confirm that yes, ALL the whipped cream HAD in fact been made using SALT.  In regards to how the manger wanted to resolve the issue?  He threw up out of the restaurant!  Seriously!  That was his solution!  And yes, he made me PAY for this food as well!  Now how did someone confuse salt for sugar in their kitchen?  Is beyond me.  And why would someone be (apparently) trimming their fingernails in an open and operating kitchen?  Is also beyond me!  And to get confrontational with your customers because they complain about these things?  Is also beyond me.  Point to my story?  Steer clear of Marie Callendars!"}
{"text":"1 word. PIE!!!!

they have really good pies here, traditional, and some not so traditional...but still really good. 

food is ok. nothing that will blow your socks off. i find it better in my freezer section then in the restaurant. pot pie is pretty good too"}
