{"text":"Quick service, fresh fish and they even have my favorite of all Uni!!!!!!! This place is amazing"}
{"text":"Great Sushi - but - they don't deliver!  One post refers to \"fresh wasabi\" - it is fressh green horseradish (like most sushi places)...not acutally wasabi.    If you call for take-out ask about the specials because you'll be sad when you pick-up and see them on the wall!   Very fresh-tasting fish.  The rolls are creative and tasty."}
{"text":"This is my first review on Yelp so I know this will initially be filtered but Sushi Nomi was so great that I feel compelled to sing (type) their praises anyway!  We loved Sushi 67 (the previous and recently-departed sushi take-out in that same location) and thought it was a real gem -- so, of course, we were worried that this \"new place\" wouldn't live up to its predecessor.  However, we were pleasantly surprised and delighted with our sushi dinner.  My husband was beyond starving so we needed food.  Fast.  We were (I'm embarrassed to admit) en route to McD's drive-thru when we both thought: what about that \"new place\" in Sushi 67's spot? We were desperate, not only for food but also for a way to avoid eating something that we'd surely regret in 15 minutes.  We pulled over and I sat in the car while my husband ran in.  I expected he would just buy up whatever they had in the display case and leave.  He didn't return right away so I began to worry (he's been known to faint in similar situations).  But, as I could see down the street to the front door (and he wasn't passed out on the sidewalk), I figured they must be taking care of him.  When he returned (about 10 minutes later), he was smiling like a little boy with a bag full of candy -- or, more precisely, like a hungry man with a tray full of sushi.  We don't eat onions.  (Say what you will and despite all your protests and shocked exclamations, we just don't like 'em.)  And apparently whatever was readily available (and everything he picked) had green onions.    The sushi chef, hearing how hungry my husband was as well as his distaste for onions, insisted on whipping up a fresh series of rolls for him!  He said it'd take just 7 minutes and he really was quick!  I thought it was taking awhile because I was expecting my guy to just pick, pay and go.  But knowing that they were making our order fresh, it was super fast!  The server / cashier also sweetly offered my husband wasabi peas to tide him over while he waited.  We went home, saw our beautifully presented care package of sushi (we had the dynamic dynamite roll, shrimp shrimp roll, spicy tuna roll and the tuna & avocado roll) and happily devoured every morsel.  Everything was fresh and delicious.    (Also, I found that both the dynamic dynamite roll and the shrimp shrimp rolls were as unique in flavour as they are with their names.)    They also indicated on their menu that their soya sauce is homemade.  It has a light, smoky flavour that also doesn't taste as salty as the standard Kikkoman.    Added bonus: they also indicate sustainable seafood choices on their menu as well.  In short, we're both thrilled with Sushi Nomi and will be back again.  Both soon AND often!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here using Door Dash. I have not been in person. I was unfortunately not super impressed with the food. The miso soup was ridiculously salty, totally inedible. I have never had miso soup this salty before and I have had a lot of this soup.   The order arrived in one container and all the sushi tasted like a mixture of lemon, Ginger and wasabi, which was arranged inside the container. The mix of flavours imparted onto the sushi and it was not a good combo. I prefer sushi with just soy sauce to begin with so didn't enjoy the taste.  The food was quite high quality but the shrimp tempura roll left some sort of weird white residue on my plate, not sure what that was. Please fix the miso soup... And please stop putting lemon in the container. Would also prefer wasabi and ginger in seperate containers."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The chefs and staff are super nice and very skilled. I've eaten a lot of sushi in my time, so here are some things that stand out: - super fresh fish with new varieties daily - the best miso soup you'll ever have - soya sauce that's home made - sushi and sashimi that's been lightly grilled with a blow torch (amazingly delicious) -incredible beauty and artistry in how they present their food.   This is my favourite sushi place in the city!"}
{"text":"Really fresh, well handled fish. I highly recommend the Sushi Saiko set, which is a 9 piece nigiri sushi, and comes with a spicy tuna roll for $20. Each piece has a different, premium piece of fish, not like the common sliver of butter fish or salmon. Mine did have salmon, but the fish was pre-seasoned and garnished with a small piece of shiso leaf, so it wasn't the run-of-the-mill salmon sushi. They come pre seasoned (soy seasoning and wasabi), so don't douse it in their soy sauce (although it is homemade and seasoned with bonito flakes and kelp). Their soy sauce really enhances the simple sushi or rolls, because of the aroma of bonito. Why four stars and not five? There is limited and not-so comfortable seating, the place is small so limited privacy too, and their miso or soups come in Styrofoam containers. Not somewhere you can go to take a date to impress, and it is more a grab and go or come with a friend (or alone ;) ) for a quick bite. They display an array of grab and go boxes in the store, and you can eat it there or take out. I think they priced reasonably taking all this into account, because you wouldn't be able to find this kind of sushi for this price anywhere else in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is an amazing sushi new sushi place....even better than sushi 67. Their fish is fresh and delicious, and the customer service fantastic. The chef, Yoon(sp?) is very knowledgeable and friendly and always makes sure the quality of his fish is top notch.  So happy this place opened up in roncesvalles and will be coming back often. Sooooo good!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of small sushi restaurants that are master what they do. Sushi Nomi is that kind of place, it's on my list for top sushi takeout and they deliver. There are a few seats inside but get it to go or have it sent to you."}
{"text":"I'd give them 5 stars but my husband said 4. Sushi was made very quickly while I waited. Sashimi A had good variety and the fish was very tender, the miso soup was fantastic, and the wakame salad great. The dynamic dynamite roll was pretty spicy but delicious. My 3yo loved the kampyo roll.  There were 3 stools at a narrow bar but also two other spots for a couple of people to sit. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Sushi Nomi is excellent. Let me start by saying their sushi meets a very high freshness and quality factor (5/5).  The shop is small so there is usually only 2 spots to sit but their sushi is worth it. The sushi chef is very laid back and offers up a sushi that is both traditional as well as typical fusion style (ie: 'Dynamite' roll). I usually go for the 'Spicy Maki Set' ($18) because it's super value with a miso soup and always satisfies my hunger. I usually recommend it to first-timers as it has yet to get anything but a thumbs up!   I am always on the hunt for fresh and tasty sushi and Sushi Nomi is not just competition for the local joints, but a hidden gem for sushi lovers in the West-end!!"}
{"text":"Take-out sushi with fresh wasabi and homemade soy sauce + ginger. Recommend the Saiko set, good variety of fish all fresh and tasty. Price is fair too!"}
{"text":"The reviews are true. This place is a lot more than it looks to be and I wish I hadn't passed it so many times. Amazing fish, soy sauce, ginger...everything. Also the the book \"Squeamish about sushi\" (on one of the tables) is a must-read for Japanophiles."}
{"text":"Really fresh and super creative.   I love coming here alone and getting the charashi bowl. The pickled mushroom is so good.   I wish they were open on sundays, but that's only because it's so good."}
{"text":"I spent more than an hour coming all the way here from downtown after seeing all the positive reviews, but I couldn't be more disappointed. After placing my dine-in order, I was given the soup and salad, and then I was ignored for an hour, not even exaggerating. People who placed take-out orders over the phone long after I placed my order somehow left with their food before I got mine. The chefs didn't even start making my food until after I voiced my confusion, at that point I had already waited 45 minutes. Did not receive any kind of apology whatsoever. I got the Saiko set and some rolls, and the food was honestly so average. The fish quality was not bad, but the selection was. They liked to include a lot of tasteless, unpopular fish with unpleasant textures; the kind that one would never order a la carte. Their sushi rice was not good, it was hard and tasteless. Their rolls were equally as unimpressive, the rice to fish ratio was completely off. Overall, the service was beyond terrible, the restaurant felt very unwelcoming, and the food was extremely average. Just another overrated sushi spot that turned out to be a complete bust."}
{"text":"Freshest, good quality fish in the neighbourhood with very good sushi rice. Maybe the best sushi takeout shop in the city."}
{"text":"I should really come here more often to satisfy sushi cravings.    The sushi is really good.  I seem to lean towards the Saiko set: 9 pieces of nigiri which comes with 6 spicy tuna maki.  If you're really hungry, add on the Paul set because it's good for 6 additional pieces of nigiri.    The chef really cares about what he serves and it comes through in the quality."}
{"text":"easily some of the best sushi on roncy. The take  out is great even if you are in a hurry,  the ready made to go containers are good by themselves but if you are really wanting to try the best they have to offer order the actual sushi! the sushi seiko provides a variety of high quality fish and a variety of fish that you don't often recieve when ordering food in the area.   Honestly, try this out soon. Even the soy sauce is excellent give this place a shot asap!"}
{"text":"This small takeout sushi bar just opened a few days ago. I popped in out of curiosity on my way to pick up a coffee next door. The sushi chef and the girl working at the counter were both incredibly nice and welcoming (both were very young. I assume they or one of them own it). They have ready made, pre-packaged containers for those on the run, but I opted to order mine. The fish used in the sushi was extremely fresh and the rice was perfect.   The menu is quite small and simple, with nothing out of the ordinary on it (with the exception of a super intriguing \"sushi burrito\"). But the sushi is really, really good. There are slim pickings in Roncesvalles when it comes to sushi so this is a well needed addition to the neighbourhood. Perfect for takeout. They also have a small three seater bar in the shop, with plenty of food magazines to browse while you wait. I ate in there at the bar. I will definitely be going back. Maybe tonight."}
{"text":"Ever since this place was sushi 67 it's been a go to spot for a quick pick me up when the craving hits. A great selection of grab and go and daily seasonal fish specials if you want to try something new. Perfectly squeezed in on Roncy by the streetcar stop and a great addition for the neighborhood. Just make sure if you are planning on ordering takeout around dinner time that you plan ahead. It gets busy!"}
{"text":"Picked up a couple quick takeout sushi trays to enjoy outside during roncy rocks. Fish was good quality, flavors excellent. Wakame salad was very good. We'll return again."}
{"text":"Absolutely outraged by the wait. Literally no customers except the ones picking up take out. We sat waiting for our order for over 50 minutes until I complained and they started making it. The quality of the fish is acceptable, but going out of the way to this area and then waiting an unacceptable amount of time, turned me off this place immediately. You can find comparable quality of fish in other parts of the city without being treated poorly."}
{"text":"Not your typical sushi place. There is a certain attention to detail that you will appreciate with almost every aspect of your dining experience.  Keep in mind the place is tiny and really is only a take out place.   If you are in the mood for sushi and happen to be in the area, this is your place."}
{"text":"This place is a great little hole in the wall place with seating for 7 people.  But on a Saturday night you will find 4 people working behind the cash, so it is primarily take out. That said, I rarely have trouble finding a seat or two. I usually have the sushi saiko, which is 9 pieces of fish (all different) a six piece roll and a soup or salad. The sushi is fresh and delicious and at $21 is very good value."}
{"text":"Definitely high quality food made with passion and creativity. This has to be my favourite sushi gem in Roncy. A quick walking distance from St. Joseph's Health Centre. The restaurant is quaint with a few high tables with bar stools against the wall but they are mainly a take out shop. My go to when I'm looking for a fresh selection of sashimi. My favourite is their special maki: coconut spicy tuna. I absolutely love the texture and taste dipped into their homemade soy sauce! They do have a selection of sushi made and ready to go. But if you don't mind waiting for them to make your order, then have a seat and help yourself to complimentary water available at the front of the restaurant. I think they diffuse it with lemon and cucumbers to make you want to sit down and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time I ordered items from the menu and was very impressed by the variety of fish this place offers. The second time was a birthday celebration for my best friend and myself, and I phoned ahead and asked about having the chef do an omakase for us, and they agreed. The quality and the selection of the fish were again very good, presentation was beautiful, and we both enjoyed the dinner a lot. Thank you for accommodating our request/ preference! Will definitely come back again as it's just in my hood :)"}
{"text":"Sushi Nomi is a hidden gem in the heart of Roncesvalle, serving up fresh tasting sushi at very reasonable prices. My husband and I came here on the Victoria day Monday, we ordered the Saiko set, and the Sashimi B set. Both sets came with miso soup and salad.   The Saiko set like many other reviewers have said, includes 9 pieces of nigiri and 6 spicy tuna rolls for $23.50. They suggest not to dip in soy sauce as each piece is already sauced and garnished.   Sashimi B set includes ~20 pieces of sashimi from ~10 different of varieties so it's good for sharing. It also comes with brown rice on the side. It was about $30.  Everything was fresh and delicious and really good value. I only deducted one star because we had to wait a long time for our food to come. They were slammed from all the takeout orders.   We would definitely come back if we were in the neighbourhood, but perhaps at a less busy time."}
{"text":"went here as my buddy's friend owns the place....i was skeptical of my friend's insistence that this place was amazing, but it actually is...the seafood is fresh and there is strong attention to detail with the food ...definitely worth checking out...too bad it's in an inconspicuous area and there's lack of seating...need to open a full fledged restaurant!  matcha desserts were good, too!"}
{"text":"Definitely high quality, delicious stuff. White ginger. This is also the place to get your wasabi peas. They make takeout orders really quickly, too. Polite servers, too."}
{"text":"Finally made it here after reading about it in the now deceased GridTo. The article made this place feel so great, homemade soya sauce, fresh fish! I had to go.  Walk in, two guys busy at work. I tell them we're staying here for dinner. Looking for fresh sushi. They recommend the sushi sako. 9 pieces of fresh fish and a spicy tuna roll. We order two!  We sit down, reading children's books on sushi making. Then the food comes. They explain all nine pieces, last one no soya sauce. And each piece melts in your mouth.  All the whole this place isn't packed, but constant flow of people coming in for pickup as they ordered already.  I'd come back for the fish and the soya sauce!"}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place ever. I have never tried something that I didn't like!!! Highly recommend. The soy sauce is homemade and the wasabi is freshly ground! Also, all takeout boxes are made daily..."}
{"text":"Got doordash from here. Really fresh sushi. I hear they have fresh specials on the board but unfortunately wasn't available on doordash. Prices are higher than others but the quality was worth it"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi, with especially good prices for their lunch take away specials. I ordered off the menu rather than getting the pre-made stuff and the service was still quick and friendly. I will definitely be back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi for the price. Probably the best value for sushi in the city. We got the Sushi Saiko that included 9 special nigiri and a spicy tuna roll. The speciality fish are more unique types depending on the season and straight from Japan's Tsukiji Market. We also got the Rainbow Roll which was full of flavour and a really good portion. The place is very small, but quaint so mostly focuses on take out. For such a small hidden gem they provide a pretty authentic experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Inexpensive, fresh and delicious! Highly recommend the sushi saiko set, or alternatively you could choose from the daily board of selections. Best for take out as seating is extremely limited."}
{"text":"A tiny hidden gem that offers a variety of fish for a great price. They have fish delivered from Japan's Tsukiji fish market. Their soy sauce is made in house. I recommend ordering their Sushi Saiko set which gives you 9 pieces of chef's choice and a 6 piece tuna roll. I wouldn't say it was the freshest, but they offer specialty pieces such as red seabream, seabass, ocean perch, black seabream, and stripe jack. You'd normally wouldn't be able to find this variety for $23.5 in the city.   It's also amazing that they consciously try to use as much sustainable fish as possible. The interior is designed mainly for take-out so they have limited seating (around 8 high table seats).   Great food presentation, variety, and price!"}
{"text":"Eaten take out from here a dozen times, never disappointed. Would love to see some unique flavours among the specialty rolls, but I love 'Number 10'."}
{"text":"Top notch Sushi, super fresh fish. Best for takeout but the limited seating can make for an interesting experience"}
{"text":"This place is super cute. I grabbed a spicy combo box with 12 maki rolls for just over $11... It had three each of spicy salmon, tuna, crab, and scallop (the last of which I've never seen in rolls before). Everything tasted super fresh... You can tell they take pride in their food.  The rolls had iceberg lettuce in them, which I've also never seen before. I didn't enjoy that too much... I thought it gave the rolls a weird taste. Keep an eye out for that.  Otherwise, great experience. I grabbed one of a few seats, poured myself a complementary cup of tea, and read this cute ass book, \"Squeamish about Sushi\" while I ate. I will be back (for rolls with no iceberg lettuce)!"}
{"text":"Sushi Nomi - or nom nom sushi?!  Sooo good!  So fresh!  Only complaint?  Why such little wasabi?  Other than that 5 stars!"}
{"text":"First of all, fresh. ground. wasabi.  Where would you get that??  Makes so much difference and adds a fresh punch to your sushi.  The soy sauce also did not taste generic either and I just read now that it's homemade as well?  Awesome!  Another thing that I liked, and appreciated as a suburbanite, is that the sushi set (Saiko) that came with 9 pieces of nigiri did so with 9 DIFFERENT pieces of fish...with the instruction to eat from l-r as well.  Here, the nigiri would probably consist of 3 tuna, 3 salmon, 3 white fish.  *yawn*  Aside from the 9 pieces of nigiri, the Saiko Set and came with 6-piece spicy tuna.  Could've been spicier, but hey, that's what the wasabi's for, right?  Tea/water is self-serve.  Seats 6 ppl max at 3 separate counters.  Primarily take-out.  Tiny place.  Would definitely go back to, especially if I was in the Roncy/High Park area!"}
{"text":"Had heard a lot about this place and finally was able to go this evening. Really enjoyed the meal. The fish all good and fresh. The Sushi Saiko set was my fave out of everything we had, but it was all very yummy!  Not a lot of space to eat there, but it's a sweet space for two people to sit, chat and eat. Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I was sad to see Sushi 67 closed but glad an equal sushi place has opened up.  The young chef has talent and the young lady working along side him is always very friendly and helpful.  The Sushi Burrito is very tasty and a good option for a quick, filling lunch.   I would recommend taking a menu with you for future orders because if you're short on time, it's going to be a wait of 10-15 minutes for your order because they make everything fresh."}
{"text":"The sushi is really fresh, with unique fish options at reasonable prices. The seating is very limited, but they do have take out options. Order ahead for best selection"}
{"text":"Truly an authentic Japanese sushi take out shop.  Didn't expect this before walking in.  Small shop with no washroom, cash or debit only.  Small area for dine in, use of plastic plates and cups.    The food is authentic sushi, the sushi rice is just perfect.  Rated this 5 stars based on a take out resturant.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just ordered pick up from Sushi Nomi- we had the Sashimi A and Hot Maki Combo- it was absolutely terrible. The sushi was wet and had brown shredded lettuce (?) inside the roll. It came to $45, it was such a disappointment and we ended up throwing most of it out.  I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Sushi Nomi set up at a sushi take out place. There are also a few high Table and chairs if you want to dine in. There is a self serve corner for hot green tea and lemon water. It was a very nice setup.   The quality of food exceeds my expectation. Highly recommend the nigiri sushi Saiko set $22. Each piece of sushi has a well balance of wasabi and soya sauce/ garnish. Fish is very fresh and the selection is special. You can taste from the lesser to strong flavour comes from the natural fish flavour.   The set comes with Spicy Tuna Maki. It tastes nice but have same feeling as most of the reviewers: wonder why they use iceberg lettuce rather then cucumber. It tasted okay to me because I ate it fresh. Wonder if the lettuce will be soggy after awhile though.   We also had the Nomi Chirashi $17. The fish was fresh and thick cut. Some fish was nicely torched. Yet I had better elsewhere. If I come back, I will still prefer having the nigiri sushi.   I also got a bag of homemade matcha brownie $2.5. Tiny brownie with strong matcha flavour. It will a nice treat with green tea."}
{"text":"Finding a good sushi take out that goes beyond the mediocre salmon, tuna, and California roll is not an easy task.  Sure you've got places like Miku but the price tag and only dine options makes you wonder who has the cash flow to feed yourself a $100+ meal each week on a sushi.  My lottery ticket hasn't won me anything yet so I'm still looking for that affordable and yet quality spot.  Sushi Nomi fills that spot nicely.  This is a small store with cute little Japanese Knick knacks.  It is mostly take out but there are a few stool seating you could use.  They have many packaged meals already starting below $10 and upwards to $30+ for the bigger and nicer cuts.  I decided to splurge a bit and go for the Sashimi B set which has 21 pieces that includes nicer cuts from Japan.  Warning ... no credit card accepted!   So my Sashimi set was thoughtfully plates and had a few bright flavours mingling with the imported fish.  Some of them had the aburi treatment (gentle torching) to bring an unique flavour out. I would say that I could differences between most fish.  Some more oilier and stronger flavour (my fav actually!) but some quite light and needed a bit more help.  I would say the cuts lean more on the petite.  They're not grossly huge where you feel like a competitor for Chubby Bunny but some slices felt like they're end cuts.  I liked the variety and it's fair price seeing how some came from Japan.  Cute spot with solid sushi and won't kill your wallet!  I'll definitely come back to try more... but note, they're moving to St Clair at the end of Feb!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Who would think a small sushi take out shop like this would have a variety of rare fish selection - definitely a legit Japanese restaurant in the middle of nowhere. I love how their chalk board indicates where the fish are imported from, and it's cute how they have images of the fish on it too! Prices are decent, actually really good considering the quality and variety of the fish. The fish is really fresh! If you were to stop by, definitely go for the nigiri sushi over sashimi, and choose from the fish listed on the chalk board noting their specials!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and rolls! Quaint little piece of Japan tucked away in Roncy. Would definitely come back to enjoy more goodness!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The sushi is so fresh unlike some places. It's a cute spot with excellent service!"}
{"text":"I was heading west, and the only thing I wanted to eat was sushi. Nothing else was going to do, but I didn't know anywhere in the Roncy hood. Fortunately, I'm a savvy Yelper and out came the app. 4.5 star average for a little place right around the corner. Boom!   This place is built for take out, and they're constantly packaging up little see-through To Go containers of their daily specials and putting them under glass. Think grocery store-style only actually good fish. This sort of thing usually throws me off, but they are a popular place with locals popping in every few minutes, so the sushi remains fresh. Yum! I really enjoyed my chef's special which was a California roll with salmon on top, and I'll be back if I'm feeling fishy and am on Roncy."}
