{"text":"We went for the Tuesday night wing special and the Blarney's Gold house beer.  At 45 cents/wing we were expecting tiny little wings, these were enormous monster chicken wings!  They weren't very saucy though so next time we'll ask for extra sauce.  The fries were pricey - 4.99.  They were delicious, although they were jullienne - NOT pub style chips.  They were out of the Blarney's Gold beer, so the second choice was offered at Blarney's Gold price.  All in all, it would have been a really great weeknight out, but the clientele and barman were a little rough around the edges, to say the least - discussing their difficulties in getting into the US on account of \"one f*ckin DUI\". Yup.  The place looks pretty good but it acts like a dive bar... like all dives though, you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"Sigh... Another good bar closes.  I guess it was only a matter of time after Target closed."}
{"text":"Great food for a pub. I recommend anything on the menu - the main entrees are great ! And they accommodate for your taste. The waiters are very friendly and the chef is always willing to please your taste. Drinks are cheap and always good. They also have discounts for students from UTM."}
{"text":"went here for a karaoke night awhile back,  the food was delicious and flavorful, decent pricing on the drinks, and the \"dj\" for the karaoke had all of the hits.  the best part was this pub is very well spaced out, so it doesn't feel overly cramped by any means, a very warm environment for sure :)"}
