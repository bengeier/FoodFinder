{"text":"This place is a tucked away family owned business that has great service and everything is always fresh. The only bad thing about this place is that it closes early."}
{"text":"Ate here today for lunch, close to work, prices decent, food was good, service was fast"}
{"text":"The feed here is very good. The place is clean and the people friendly. The breakfast is what I enjoy the most about this place. They are priced fair and their portions are a decent sized. The place has been open for a while and I've been here plenty of times. The cheeseburger combo is a go to every time!  One thing that makes you more confident that this is a great place, is the fact that many people come in here and ask for John, the owner by name."}
{"text":"I used to eat at subway 5 times a week until a friend showed me this place. Now I eat here. The 6\" subs are delicious and filling"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. My office consistently has these delicious sandwiches delivered. They are always fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Got the roast beef sub,it was pretty good,kinda Chicago style.Had peppers and mushrooms with a great roll,decent price.I wiill be back."}
{"text":"This is the best sub shop around. The food is great, fast, and their customer service is amazing. We love coming here for lunch."}
{"text":"this sub place is super close to my work office, which is the reason I decided to give it a shot. Got in the car and drove there, it took me longer to find it than the drive there. I walked in and immediately a strong old building smell stung my nostrils, I was starving so I didn't turn back.   I ordered the Arizona Delight(whole) on white bread. I sat for about a minute and I was called for my order.   I was disappointed from the first bite. It was sooo bland. Then the second bite... this bite included the turkey, bacon, avocado tomato, lettuce and \"cheese\". You would think no one can fuck up a sandwich that has these ingredients... well, this was the worse sub ever! I tossed it out as soon as I realized I paid over $6.40 for kraft singles yellow singles \"cheese\"   I will not be coming back here again and I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Pastrami sandwich is awesome. I will have to return. The place is tucked away and out of sight. Service is good and fast."}
{"text":"1st time - lunch on a Friday. The four of us were NOT disappointed. Sandwiches were large and tasty - reasonably priced, and w/good service. Greek chicken wrap had nice chicken slices, and heavy on the dressing. Mo-in-law ate her entire roast beef mini, a 1st for her. In total, more 'local' and different than the pedestrian Subway shops out there."}
{"text":"Love this place, I go a few times a month for lunch! Owners are great and so are their sandwiches. I always get the Arizona Sub and I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is an average sub. Really well priced. I would say it's a good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Despite the limited hours, this place has really good subs and sandwiches and would recommend everyone to try it!"}
{"text":"Some of the softest sammy bread that I've ever had that just didn't disintegrate. Had the chicken salad was very flavorful but not over done. A lot of salad givin on my Sammy. A lot of drivers here (ups, fed ex ect...) so that told me it was good. Must try"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat and always busy when we go in.  The guy that owns it is nice has a great gem in a business park"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Some coworkers and I were boycotting our crappy cafeteria food and decided to go out. We did a quick yelp search and decided to come here. It is really tucked away, but we were pleasantly surprised when we found it. It was busy but not packed. We each ordered a different sub and they were all delicious. The bread is awesome and the veggies were fresh. A whole is enormous, so next time we will get minis. Overall we were really impressed and will definitely be back to this great little sub shop."}
{"text":"Not a great location, invisible from the street, located in a business park. Ate the worst ruben [sic] of my life. Like gas station quality. Makes Arby's look gourmet. Meat was slimy, gelatinous, currently struggling to keep it down."}
{"text":"We love this place!  The service is super fast and my husband raves about the turkey sub.  He says there is something about the mayo that just makes the sub incredible. Heck, every sub and sandwich I've tried has been delicious!  I love their hot soups and they have a great teriyaki chicken bowl some days.  Check out the white board for their daily specials.  They also have salads, fruit and other items in the old case if you get there early enough.  The staff is super nice and they work hard to make us happy.  They even have a punch card so after so many subs you get a free one.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I found this hidden gem on yelp! I ordered the chicken salad and it was super delicious! The service was great, the time it took them to give us our sandwiches was amazing, and the price was not too bad. Definitely recommend this to those who have short lunch hours."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sub shop on the planet! I used to work in the area and ate here all the time, but I still get strong cravings for this place. If you work or live in the area go here for a sub, I promise you wont be disappointed, The bread is super fresh as well as their veggies and meats. Italian sub is best sub I have ever had!"}
{"text":"The is a smallish location in an office complex off of 24th ave. The sandwich options are 5\" and 10\". I think the 5\" is a little too small but the prices are very reasonable. They have have about 10 selections to choose from and none are really original. The sandwiches are pretty tasty but nothing to write home about. The gentlemen behind the counter is pretty friendly and I get the impression that he is the owner. There are about 7-10 tables and they are often still dirty from the previous customer. It would be nice if they cleaned them a little more often.  Overall pretty good and I'll eat here again but not worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"Hidden gem.  There's something about a classic turkey sub with lettuce, tomato and mayo that I just love.  This place nailed it."}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite while at work. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you are in the area this is a great hidden delight, The ingredients are the freshest I have had before the \"Lettuce, tomatoes, Onions\" etc are worth trying even if you do not normally care for them."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this sub shop from someone at work. They have really great subs, but I didn't really like their macaroni salad so I gave it to a co-worker. I had soup from there too, and it was yummy!"}
{"text":"You can't ask for a better lunch time sandwich joint than this place. The staff is friendly, and the food is always awesome. I really Love their salads and wraps, they are huge portions and leave you full, without the heavy feeling. I call my order in and swing by and pick it up. Fast, friendly and reliable."}
{"text":"For the location and the size, this shop is busy and for good reason. The subs are very good and you have a say in what goes on them.   I was full after a whole sub and I didn't feel bad for it which is an added benefit.  The price for my sub, drink, and chips was just over $9.00.   Not a lot of seating but this shop is more for \"grabbing and going\".  Would eat here again and if you happen to be here for work or a conference give it a go."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from a few coworkers, my friend and I decided to go grab some subs for lunch today. How did i survive so long on my crappy work cafeteria food when this was 2 mins away???  Its great, its a hidden little spot right off of 24th street with amazingly fresh food and speedy service. Not only that, but the cost is super cheap! The mini subs are in the 3 dollar range and are perfect for lunch. We will be back...many, many times."}
{"text":"Hidden little gem - if you want to pick up a fresh, delicious sandwich for a fair price stop in.  I work very close and we visit once a week and it's fast and this place makes a good sandwich.  If you are in the area stop in for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwich, had a club on wheat sub. Everything tasted fresh and good. Lemonade is good. Price is decent paid 8.50 for sub,chips and drink"}
