{"text":"I came here on a weekday night and it was completely empty. I'm not familiar with Indian sweets so I spent some time looking at the display. Their sweets weren't labeled so it was hard for people like me who are new to Indian sweets. While I was choosing my sweets, the cashier looked annoyed with me and had an attitude. When we left, my bf asked, \"Was it just me or was she really rude?\" 

The sweets weren't too good either. I got 2lbs of sweets and ended up throwing away more than half. This was my second time at an Indian sweet shop. The first time I got Indian sweets, I devoured the box in a day. I will be returning to the other place and not this one."}
{"text":"If you like vegetarian food this the better place than Brars buffet. However, they donot have much choices to eat but better and fresh. Also, indian sweets, samosas and lots more are freshly cooked service needs to be improved..."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this 'street' food. This is a small take out place with delicious, Vegetarian food. From snack food to curries and Indian sweets you get it all here. They also have 3 smaller tables for seating if you come here to eat.

I  absolutely love their chaat papri here. Their chaat, yogurt, sauces and toppings are simply delicious. Their curries and chapathi, parottas are pretty good too. I love their saag paneer (spinach and paneer curry).

Polite, fast service. There really isn't much place to sit, they do have maybe 2 tables. it's more of a take out place. Luckily all their food travels well. 

They have a good selection of Indian sweets as well. But yes, this is a 100% vegetarian restaurant - so be warned meat eaters."}
{"text":"They've updated their menu but still the taste is same. I'm giving 3 stars just for the sake of old times. Sweets are not fresh neither are the sweets. One day I was not in the mood of cooking so I bought veg thali (around 8:30 pm) .. when I reached home and started eating it two of the curries were smelling bad and we were not able to eat. When we were tired so we ate the rest of the stuff and left those two curries.

After few days I craved for imarti while shopping at Indian grocery so I thought to visit this place again. I suddenly remembered what happened few days before while ordering the sweet and I told the girl who was taking my order. She denied that this could happen and she said that I must have put the food in the plastic to eat the next day!! I was shocked.. I was hungry, I bought food and straightaway I opened it within 15 minutes after buying it and the girl is saying that it's my fault!

Never going back again... now I prefer Samosa And Sweet Factory. Their food and sweets are always fresh!!"}
{"text":"I give 5 stars for the sweets, 5 stars for paneer pakora, 4 stars for namak paaray and samosay, 3 stars for halwa puri that is served on Sat Sun.  Rest of the food is lame."}
{"text":"Great value for money on their main dishes. A wide selection of delicious sweets.

Naan, bhatura and even the rice is always fresh. Just a handful of entree platters to choose from. We usually get the veggie thali for $5.99, it's the most expensive and comes with: a choice of three curries, veg mixed basmati rice, small salad, naan and a dessert. The channa bhatura dish is another favorite and sells for just $4.50.

It's not a formal restaurant, so order at the counter and find a seat if you're eating in. Staff are usually friendly and easy to deal with. Vegetarian only. But I highly recommend it for even those who aren't as it's surprisingly good food.

Note: As the name suggests, they are primarily an Indian sweets shop, and offer a large selection of colorful treats. I've only tried a couple, and being no expert, find them pretty satisfying."}
{"text":"Best chole bature I've had in North America! Their desserts are outstanding as well. Very fresh & melt in your mouth. We discovered this place on a Google search a few years ago & keep coming back. They have interesting Indian paintings. The staff is friendly & the place is neat except for the bathrooms.
They just need to bus & clean up their bathrooms more often & have a better system for stacking used dishes rather than blocking the entry door to the bathroom with trash receptacle piles high with dirty dishes."}
{"text":"Very delicious foods. Amazing spices. Samosas were my favourite. Naan was good. Good prices. Good service."}
{"text":"After waiting in line in Brar's and getting older by the minute ...

We decided to cross the street over to this place.

If you feel like blowing the calorie budget, go here!   Exceptional Indian sweets as well as vegetarian food (thali).  Try the barfis - pistachio ... coconut ... milk cake ... ladoos ... jalebis ... pakoras and samosas.  This is NOT a place to go if you're on a diet.  Regardless ... nice place, polite counter service.  Yum!"}
