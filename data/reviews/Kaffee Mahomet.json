{"text":"Tucked in the corner INSIDE of the IGA grocery store, this is a hidden gem of a coffee shop. It's not what you'd expect in a grocery store. Because it's in the corner, the setting is quiet and cozy without the noise of even a typical shop. Coffee options are great and the prices are cheaper than anything you'd find in the C-U area. Deb has a wonderful personality and gets her roasts fresh from Columbia Street right in town. Definitely check it out (and grab a few chocolates or pastries to top it off!)!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Kaffee. The coffee is amazing, the owner and the employees are so sweet, and the atmosphere is friendly and inviting. There's free wifi so I come here to study. I CANNOT wait to get sunny days brew everyday. I highly recommend it. If you're not a coffee fan they also have amazing smoothies, frappuccinos, macchiatos and a TON of delicious pastries (include a phenomenal banana muffin) which are all from a local baker!"}
{"text":"A crying shame. Was excited to get a real coffee experience outside the big city but, no. Weak. See thru. A tad pricey for the experience."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting and disappointed to see that there was only one coffee shop. But Kaffee is all you need!!! We chatted with the owner for a little bit and she was really friendly. The coffee was great! I had the black velvet and my husband got the Scandinavian. We also ordered a cinnamon role and it was incredible!"}
{"text":"This is a very conveniently located coffee house off interstate 74 between Bloomington Illinois and champaign.  Located in Mahomet 1 minute from the interstate inside the IGA grocery store   Very very good coffee drinks. Strong smooth espresso that makes the americano compete heads up to Starbucks! Wide variety of drinks.  Also great location."}
