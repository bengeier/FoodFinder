{"text":"Great food, great staff. I ordered the traditional classic bowl. It was absolutely delicious. The ingredients were fresh and flavourful. Best poke place in Toronto! Highly recommend it and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"If you like Sushi, you will love this place! Had their Hawaï classic, it was delicious. Since it's a fish market , they also sell their marinated salmon, tuna and octopus by the pound. No sitting space unfortunately :/ !"}
{"text":"I'm so so into this place.  Pretty tiny, order at the counter, couple of window seats to sit at, surfy pineapply vibe, right on that lively stretch of Baldwin in the heart of Kensington.  The poke is delicious.  I'd previously perused poke options on ubereats and the bowls here are the most reasonably priced with a snack option for well under $10 and the regular size at around $10.    Staff are friendly and enthusiatic about poke (and i think they're maybe legit Hawaiians too?  which makes me feel a bit better about jumping on the poke bandwagon).  Highly recommend asking the guy behind the counter for recommends, he does a great rundown of the options.  I had the shack special - flavourful and the gochuchang and kimchi crema are flavourful but not too aggressive on the palate.  my ONLY question mark is that i did not ask about how the fish were caught because i was being greedy and just wanted to eat the thing so no idea where they sit on the ethical spectrum."}
{"text":"Best poke in Toronto! Fell in love with poke when i was in hawaii and have tried lots of places in toronto in search of authentic hawaiian poke and this is definitely the closest thing to it - brings me back to hawaii for sure! Fair prices, good portion size, friendly staff, and super cute decor. Will definitely be back! P.S. also try the shaved ice! Yum!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite poke places in Toronto. I usually get the Shack Special or the Hawaii Classic. The fish is fresh, the combinations of ingredients is really good and decent portion size for the regular sized bowl."}
{"text":"Excellent dishes, fish is quite fresh, friendly staff. Interestingly vibe and artwork, gives you a bright and fresh feel. Had the Hawaiian classic, big wave, and the musupi. People's watching from theirs windows right in the heart of Kensington was a bonus."}
{"text":"Came here once and I need more!!! I'm a sushi lover and these bowls do hit the spot when I'm on the go, so much goodness in one bowl should be illegal! Haha  ...I'm not huge on rice, so I opted for me veggies but I have to say my bowl was complete with it, cooked just right! A little far from me but definitely will hit it up whenever I'm in the area! Yummmm"}
{"text":"Walking into Kensington market, it's a cute decorated place. Very clean and well organized with speedy service. I had ordered 3 small size poke bowls for 15$ what a deal! Poke Bowl came in 3 sizes: Small, Regular and Large. The small was $5.95 by itself, so the 3 for 15$ was an amazing deal considering you can try out three different poke bowls if you were sharing it with a friend as I was! I had ordered the Hawaiian classic, Waimea and Shack special. They all tasted great. I thought the small would be too small, but when you get it it was a great size for one person to eat! The people working there are very friendly. I would come here again with friends and recommend it to whoever wants to try a poke bowl and your nearby kensington market!"}
{"text":"Tasty and pretty quick. Dig the grab-and-go spam musubi too."}
{"text":"My first experience with North Poke was months after they opened. It was disappointing because the reviews hyped me up. It was so fishy, I just thought maybe it was nearing end of day. I imagined my salmon sat all day. Today I had it again at Pusateri's, I was pretty excited and I wanted to just snack on protein so that's all I got a bowl of Waimea protein ($10.95). Now although this wasn't fishy, thank God. I couldn't help but just taste the sauce and onions. I couldn't even taste the salmon and edamame cos the sauce just overpowers it. I also noticed that it was poorly sliced. The meat was very grainy and there were tiny bones here and there. I really wanted to give this place a shot given the rave reviews. I'll stick to my 2 go-to spots for now Poke Guys and Pokito (their proteins taste fresh even at night before closing when I usually go for dinner)"}
{"text":"You had me at Poke.  With all the poke restaurants popping up in the city, North Poke by far is my favorite, by using only the freshest fish and ingredients combined with the right amount of dressing and spice it truly is Hawaiian style poke. Kudos to you guys for making poke right. #foreverafan"}
{"text":"The fish seemed fresh but not marinated enough as they mix it to order. A bigger selection of sides would be nice. Their sauces were mediocre nothing too special. Portions were average. We went during lunch time and it wasn't too busy, maybe 3-4 people in line."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since they opened. Service is friendly and laid-back, but understandably slow since they're still trying to get workflow optimized.   Between my friends and I, we've tried everything on the poke menu. (Tip: They have a 3 snack sized bowls for $15 special, good for sharing and trying lots of different types of poke). My favourites have been the Waimea and The Big Wave, great balance in flavour. Their poke bowls are much more simple in terms of accompanying ingredients as compared to other poke places, but I find this gives better (and more appropriate) focus on the fish itself.  Their octopus poke is also very interesting. I recommend asking for salad instead of rice though for this because it comes with potatoes already (unless you want to starch it up even more).  Spam musubis are also available (but not on the main menu)!"}
{"text":"Tried the 1/2 Hawaiian 1/2 Waimea bowl this afternoon for lunch and it was amazing. The fish is so fresh and perfectly marinated and I was pleasantly surprised to find the other ingredients were just as fresh. Some places skimp on the quality of the rice or other ingredients, but not here. I felt like I was having a quality meal from beginning to end and could taste the balance of all the flavours...seaweed, shoyu marinade, shallots...mmm.   Great service and as others have commented, the size is misleading - I was definitely full at the end of it, likely because of the good portions of fish. They also had a featured scallop poke as well - something I would want to try next time! Highly recommend and will be returning again soon."}
{"text":"Great place, it was my first experience with Hawaiian food and it has been really good! The bowls are very generous there is a lot of fish (I had the Hawaii classic) I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch recently. Lovely place with super friendly staff. Tried the 3 bowl sample which was well worth the price. My favorite is the Waimea which you definitely need to try. Overall one of the best Poke around."}
{"text":"What's not to like? The Poke here is amazing, as are the staff.  Crave this on a weekly basis!"}
{"text":"Went to try their poke bowls just recently, having previously been to rollation on dundas. Had the Hawaii classic. The fish was fresh, taro chips were great. The only downfall was that I found for the portion size (I got a regular) it was quite expensive! Rollation had similar pricing, but much bigger sizes. They also have very little seating, about two small bar height tables on either side with about four seats per table."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during the week and it is my new go-to lunch spot! Working in the Queen and Spadina area there are so many options available, but you and your co-workers can never decide what to get. When you're looking for a healthy, affordable and delicious option, you typically have to settle for maybe 2 out of those 3 factors. North Poke checks all 3 boxes for me. I had the Hawaii Special and they did not skimp out on ingredients like they do at other Poke places in Toronto. Staff was super friendly and I can't wait to try everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"Been waiting for the authentic Poke experience since coming back from Oahu 2 years ago... And I've finally found it! Best Poke this side of the Pacific...nothing but the freshest salmon and tuna and some very creative bowl options. Well priced and service is quick and friendly. Can't wait to go back... To Kensington that is..."}
{"text":"I love this place. The fish is the highlight as it should be. Normally I stick with salmon whenever I eat fish but I enjoyed the albacore and ahi just as much, they're doing something special. The service is very friendly as well. I'd recommend this place to anyone whether they're looking to try poke for the first time or are already familiar with it."}
{"text":"We arrived at North Poke located in the Kensington market on a rainy weekday afternoon.  Seating was very limited but we were able to grab 2 seats at North Poke immediately.  This was my first time trying out the Hawaiian inspired poké bowls and I was quite excited.    North Poke offers 7 different Poké Bowls and it was hard for me to just pick one.  It's great that they offer a snack size option and we were able to choose 3 snack sized poké bowls for $15.  At first, I was afraid the snack size may not be enough to share for two people but I was wrong.  The portion and the ingredients on the snack size bowls were very generous and they ended up to be the perfect amount for us to share as we have a smaller appetite.  From the 7 different types of Poke Bowls, we ordered the Hawaii Classic, Molokai with Salmon and Ono.    Hawaii Classic:  Sesame shoyu marinade, nori, cucumber, ahi tuna, green onions, fried shallots, toasted sesame  Molokai:  Salmon/ahi tuna, sweet soy marinade, sambal crema, jalapeno, pickled shallots, nori, watermelon radish, green onions  Ono:  octopus, potato, roasted red peppers, chorizo oil, lemon aioli, caper infused breadcrumbs  Out of the three bowls, the Hawaii Classic was my favorite and stands out the most for me but the other two bowls were also quite good.  The ahi tuna in the Hawaii Classic were well marinated and very flavorful, the rest of the ingredients added additional taste and texture to the bowl and they were all well balanced.  I also loved that the rice was warm and really brought out the aroma as the sauce sinks down into the rice.    I will definitely come back to North Poke as I am already craving for more poké bowls now."}
{"text":"The poke is offered in two sizes.i got the regular and it was packed with the topping and fish! All the ingredients are also very fresh. This is a good place to go if you aren't in a big group as there isn't a lot of seating."}
{"text":"Hands down the best poke in the city. They get it right with their flavoring and the prices are very fair. The fish is fresh. It's simply perfect."}
{"text":"First saw this place on Instagram and and was glad I was able to stop by during my short visit to Toronto. The moment you step in their cute little shop, you are greeted by friendly faces and given a run through of their menu and the ingredients used. You're even given samples to taste to help you make your selection! The poke itself taste fresh with lots of flavour without being overpowering like some of the other poke restaurants I've tried. Very authentic! The Big Wave and Waimea are my two favorites! Overall I highly recommend the North Poke - not just for the poke, but honestly one of the best customer service experiences I've had to date."}
{"text":"Just received my foodora order! Went the other day and just couldn't wait to go back, luckily there's delivery service. The staff were super friendly and made suggestions after directing me to the window display of their fish market. I ended up tasting 3 of their bowls - Waimea, Hawaii classic and the big wave. All 3 were super fresh. The marinade on the fish are incredible flavourful. Wouldn't consider any other poke shops in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Love the new location of north poke! So conveniently close to work and I get to enjoy fresh fish on the go. Highly recommended place for lunch! The price point is also amazing."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I found my salad got a little wet and it didn't make for a very pleasant base - next time I'd do the rice. The main reason I gave it 4 stars is because they are a little cheap with their avocado. 15 bucks for a bowl isn't cheap, can I at least get more than 3 slivers of avocado?"}
{"text":"The best poke you can possibly get in the city! I refer all my friends to this place because its clean, its quick and the food options are so good! They don't have a bad choice on the menu at all. Make sure you get a coconut drink with the food; perfect complement. Must try!"}
{"text":"Love love love this Poke place. One of the best in the city for sure! The sauce was on point, not drenching the fish but enough that it was super savoury. The portions are always so good too. A regular is perfect for a healthy lunch as it doesn't feel too heavy. Finding something healthy and fast always seems like such a daunting task but with the variety on the menu, it was easy to eat here a couple times a week and not be bored. LOVE this spot! Must check it out!!!"}
{"text":"I have tried poke at many places in downtown. North Poke is definitely my favorite, and agreed by many foodies around me. I ordered the Hawaiian bowl. Their fish is fresh and tasty. Portion is good too. They have small and large size as well as snack size to try.   I also love the decor of the place. Very Hawaiian."}
{"text":"I love this place! Poke is so hot in Toronto right now, and I've tried Poke Guys, Miss Thing's, that Poke place on Queen St. W, etc... anyway, I've tried a lot of poke, but I find this place to be the most authentic. I like my poke simple with few ingredients so you can really savour the fish. All the other places load up their bowls with too much stuff that the flavours don't compliment each other. North Poke does it right. 100% recommend if you like good fish."}
{"text":"My first time trying the shack special. The salmon is very fresh and the portion is perfect - enough protein for a meal. I found this meal a healthy alternative and provides a taste of korea. The fried shallot definitely enhances the flavor of the salmon. Overall, im impressed."}
{"text":"First time to enjoying Poké in Toronto.  Last time we had any was at Ono Seafood on Oahu.  The Ahi Tuna,  rice, seaweed and different marinades were excellent.  Everything is fresh. A nice treat given the current climate in early January.    I only have two recommendations to help move them from a four to a five-star restaurant.    First, include an option for brown rice instead of the current only white rice offering.   Second, only have the marinades and the fresh fish mixed at the time of ordering.  Not sure if today's experience was due to it being early Sunday evening.  Finally,  the staff are very nice and polite.  I would love to have them have a location near our home in the Yonge-Eglinton area."}
{"text":"3.5 star  I have tried 4 more place for poke in toronto. So I can see what is good or not good.  Got 10%off coupon from yelp so I desided to try.  It was so tiny place located in kensington market and cute interiored.  I got large size of classic hawaii.  My first thought is ..pricey than other poke place... and too tiny space so there was almost no place to eat and no washroom somthing. Waiting area is so uncompy too.  For the taste.. It was not bad and also not stella.  Btw, I really liked the chip!! What is it made of?? If I could buy that chips only, I will visit again!! So tasty and goes with super well with beer!!  Anyways I got large size but I donno why It didnt feel filling...  There was so much rice on the bottom and chips seweed salad avocado marinated tuna was on the top of rice. But the fish was fresh than other poke places.   Large poke was almost 16 dollar after 10% off.  Anyways staffs were kind and friendly.  I am not sure I will visit again but next time I would like to try salmon one!!:)"}
{"text":"I got the snack bowls 3 for $15 which was a great option to have for someone like myself considering how indecisive I am. I was able to try three different flavours: Hawaii classic, Waimea and Big Wave. They were all delicious and fresh tasting but my favourite was the classic. Brings back memories of having poke in Hawaii! Definitely would be my go to poke shop when I am craving poke and missing Hawaii."}
{"text":"I've tried my fair share of Poke since it started up a few years back and North Poke has topped the list for me.   Location: located at the tip of Chinatown in a new trendy area at the Baldwin strip. Walking distance from Kensington Market.  Food: I typically say clear of Spam but this would be the only time where spam is acceptable. The Terayaki Musubi makes you wonder why Spam was ever packaged in a can.   They have included the option for you to have tasters where you can try 3 poke for around $15. Great way to feel it out before picking your main choice.  There's no doubt that my favourite bowl is Salmon - Waimea Poke.   Yelpers get perks for eating here... Just make sure you ask what the current deals are.   Overall, my latest craze... try it.. you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Waimea bowl was a total disappointment. And I will probably have the same conclusion for all the other ones because the seaweed salad they use is a cheap one. I took one bite even though I knew it was going to taste bad because it was taking up 1/4 of my bowl and thought it would be a waste if I didn't even try to eat it. Nope never again. And very generous with 5 edamame beans when they can buy 2lb bag of edamame beans for less than $10 from wholesale."}
{"text":"I had Poke here once. I got the impression it wasn't very fresh as it is all premixed and on display. It was room temperature and a bit expensive for the quality. It was room temperature which made it seem more iffy. I won't be going back. I suggest trying poke at a place that makes it to order individually."}
{"text":"I learned of North Poke through TO Finest's food passport. For $5.65 you get a snack size Waimea poke bowl and a teryaki musubi.  The snack size may seem small, but the ingredients within it make the bowl quite filling. It's a good size to bring you over from a late lunch to early dinner.   The thing that stood out the most for me was how fresh the ingredients were. The bowl included salmon, edamame, sweet onion, seaweed salad, avocado, fried shallots and roasted sesame - all very fresh. I also can't forget the taro chips. It was not overly drenched in the aoili which was good and the salmon portion was plentiful. There was a bit of a spicy kick to the aioli.   As much as I enjoyed the poke, my favorite part of the meal was the musubi. Essentially it's a slice of spam, sandwiched with rice and wrapped in a thick strip of seaweed. I don't think I've ever enjoyed spam until now. The teriyaki flavour was sweet which complemented the saltiness of the spam. I probably could've eaten three of these, they were so good! The rice was fresh and had a bit of flavour which made it interesting (not sure what it was) and the seaweed had a good crunch to it.   My boyfriend also had the passport and being Muslim, he couldn't eat the musubi, but the ladies at North Poke (without hesitation) suggested adding extra toppings to his bowl instead. They were very accommodating which we appreciated! :)"}
{"text":"Over all, not so bad in a food court. The Tuna needs more seasoning. Loaded with toppings."}
{"text":"The best poke in Toronto. Truly. As I've tried many (i.e. Poke guys, lawai'a, squarefish, su&bu, big tuna, pokito), I always find myself gravitating towards North Poke as I find myself ordering from them whenever I am downtown. The fish is so flavourful, not too overly dressed/sauced but just marinaded enough that eliminates the fishy taste raw fish sometimes gives you.   I always order a large and they fill it up with fish and toppings. They do not skimp on the fish!! (Which is really important to me as I love my protein). The toppings are classic and simple (avocado, seaweed salad, taro chips, sweet pickled onions) really mix well with the flavours of the fish that you choose. Whereas some places put fruit in their poke for who knows what reason!!!   On a side note: Their catering options are really affordable as I've bought two 2.5 lb trays from them in the past for a reasonable price. They have yet to disappoint me and I don't think they ever will."}
{"text":"Not as good as their other location. The rice in my bowl was not great, overcooked/it was the rice from the bottom of the pan. So half the rice was rough and all stuck together."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Right in the heart of Kensington Market. Very friendly, professional service. No place to sit. Very fair prices. One of the better poke places in downtown Toronto.  Also came here with the food passport and paid about $5.65 for the Waimea Poke Bowl and Teriyaki Musubi - for their SNACK size. Depending on the poke, the prices ranges from: snack ($5-6), regular ($9-11), and large ($13-15).  Contrary to the naysayers and lovers, I found this place fairly average. Their snack size was actually quite filling for me. Sashimi/ salmon was great. Taro chips were my favourite - super crunchy! Everything else in it (fried shallots, toasted sesame, seaweed salad) was on point.  However, the spam sushi was a turn-off for me. Their rice wasn't fresh out of the pot, stale in fact!  Overall, their prices are actually on-par or cheaper than most of the poke places I've been to. For the price I paid, it was a very fair portion! Not overly spectacular for your senses, but will probably be back for their taro chips (also sold separately), and to try their other specials!  N.B. Gluten-free options available!"}
{"text":"If you want an authentic Hawaiian poké experience then I recommend North Poké. In case you didn't know, poké is pronunced POH-kay and the word means to cut or slice. Poké is a traditional Hawaiian raw fish salad that is served on rice. North Poké also serves 2 other popular items in Hawaii. They are spam musubi and shave ice. These are 3 of the must eat foods if you are a tourist in Hawaii. I believe if you like eating Japanese sashimi or Mexican ceviche, you will also like eating Hawaiian poké.  Based on my visits to Poke Guys, Pokito and Calii Love, North Poké offers the best and most authentic Hawaiian food experience in Toronto. North Poke serves food only in the classic, traditional way. They do not offer Californized dishes or fusion dishes e.g. sushi burittos, doshi (DOughnut suSHI), food ingredients added in poké bowls that you don't see in Hawaii.  North Poké offers a simple menu of 8 signature poké bowls. They don't offer a build your own poké bowl menu. You do have the option of choosing your base from white rice or salad. I like the limited menu options because I can make my decision faster. It's sort of like omakase in Japanese restaurants where you trust the chef to decide what you get to eat. I trust North Poké to offer me the most authentic Hawaiian food experience that they can.  The reason why I trust North Poké is because they prepare the poké focusing on using the freshest and best sashimi quality fish available and marinating the fish. When you eat poké, the marinated fish cubes matter the most than the toppings and rice.  I think knife cutting skills are important. I didn't like the bigger cube like pieces cut at Poke Guys. Bigger pieces means less marinating of the fish. I didn't like the marination of the poké at Calii Love because it tasted like there was none. Another reviewer had the same opinion as me regarding the poké they ate at Calii Love. It felt like you were eating unmarinated, raw fish.  The poké bowls I have tried so far at North Poké are Hawaii Classic, Molokai, Shack Special. In general, I enjoyed eating these poké bowls. The drizzled dressing on top complemented the toppings and fish. The toppings from the green onions to the avacado were fresh. I liked the crispy pieces of taro chips. The marinated fish cubes were delicious. The portions of fish, toppings and rice were good. I didn't find myself with too much rice. The white rice that is served is not really to my liking. One time, I found the white rice hard and probably old. Another North Poké reviewer mentioned the same thing. I like the sushi rice served at Pokito, which was like the rice used to make maki rolls.  After you finish eating your poké, order a shave ice for dessert. This frozen treat is not the same as a snow cone or 7-Eleven slurpee. The correct pronunication is shave ice without a 'd' on the end of shave. In Hawaiian grammar, there is no past tense of a word. Shave Ice can be purchased all over Hawaii. What makes shave ice different is how it is made. The shave ice machine takes ice cubes or ice blocks and basically shaves the ice down into coarse ice chunks about the size of a pin head. The shave ice is filled into a cute flower cup and patted down to create a mound. The shave ice holds the syrup flavours in the ice top to bottom better than crushed ice. This allows you to taste the flavour with each bite of ice. You can order a shave ice with up to 2 syrup flavours added. Condensed milk is added to the top. I ask for no condensed milk so I can taste more of my 2 flavours. I chew the crunchy ice as I taste the flavours. The flavours I have tried are blue raspberry, luscious lime, coconut and mango.The shave ice is eaten with a spoon and you can use a straw to drink the melted shave ice and flavouring. It takes about 15 minutes to eat.   North Poke even provides an authentic shave ice experience! The syrup flavouring is purchased from a Hawaiian shave ice company and the cups provided are the same as the ones I have seen in photos online. As far as I am aware, none of the other Toronto poké shops are serving shave ice.  I have chosen North Poké as my poké shop of choice because of what I wrote above. Where else are can you get poké, spam musubi and shave ice all in one location in Toronto?"}
{"text":"Skeptical at first of the poke bowl craze I was hesitant of trying them but North Poke opened my eyes and even my friend claims that these bowls have opened a new world.   We tried the Hawaii Classic and Shack Special and were definitely satisfied with the price for the quality and amount of the snack bowls. The fish was perfectly seasoned and melted in your mouth, both the salad and rice had a slight seasoning, the sauces were not heavy, and the avocado complemented the crisp pickled onion and crunchy taro chips. It was fresh and filling.   I would definitely recommend going and I hope to return again!"}
{"text":"I like it that they allow you to buy the Poke by weight because sometimes I just want to eat it in addition to other food I'm having as my protein boast. My husband did say that their rice is not as good is poke guys(not as chewy). I really liked the big wave because I thought the citrus marinade was very refreshing. Overall I would come back, but I wouldn't get the rice with my poke, probably just salad or just the poke by weight l."}
{"text":"Store was very busy on a thursday afternoon, but food was preppared quickly so the wait was not long. We ordered the Waimei and it was very tasty. All the toppings really make the poke bowl. A regular poke bowl should be enough for a regualr lunch, but if they were to include a smidge more rice, it would be perfect.   Sidenote: a customer accidentally knocked shattered their bottle of Snapple, and the employees were very quick in cleaning it up but most of all were very polite and friendly about the accident happening and even offered another bottle of it."}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious poke bowls. The only downside with the location is it is meant more as a take out place as there is barely any seating area. Will definitely come back in the summer when I can walk around outside with my poke bowl."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place for the first time but was disappointed with their service.  I ordered two dishes, the Hawaii classic for myself and The big wave for my husband.  I waited for 20mins and they did a bait and switch on me.  For my Hawaii classic, there was two pieces of ahi tuna and the rest was albacore tuna(the big wave) on top.  It looks like they ran out of Hawaii and instead of telling me, they tried to pass off one type of fish for another.  My dish and my husband's dish looked identical except I had two pieces of ahi tuna in mine.  The food was good but not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had the Waimea bowl, and all the toppings were very flavorful and well seasoned, especially the fish which tasted very fresh. There is also a good toppings to rice ratio compared to other poke bowl places I've tried. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"\"Sushi white rice\" was unseasoned. It was also way overcooked. Thanks for ruining my meal."}
{"text":"This place has the best reviews out of all the poke places in Toronto, so I've been anticipating trying it for a long time. I'm not sure if it's because I had such high expectations, but I was pretty disappointed to be honest. We had the Hawaiian classic and big wave regular. I feel like the portions here are definitely smaller than the other poke places I've tried. The fish was fresh though, especially the ahi tuna in the classic . The albacore tuna in my big wave was pretty meh-- don't think the marinate complemented the fish well, didn't really do much for it. Both bowls we felt like didn't have as much flavour or depth as we wanted, there wasn't much going on. Didn't have much of a wait time though when we went. It definitely wasn't bad but I'm just not sure I'd purposely make the trip here again, especially with all the new poke places popping up."}
{"text":"I've never actually *been* to North Poke but it has quickly become my go-to on Uber Eats. Their bowls are consistently well-prepared and they always pack them generously. My favourite is the Hawaii classic - the marinade on the tuna is the best I've had in Toronto or Vancouver, and is delicious accompanied by the seaweed salad and other trimmings. The amount of food is filling and very reasonably priced.   Highly recommended. Don't ever change!"}
{"text":"The poke bowls here are so good! The pricing is good for specific unlimited toppings. The only problem we had was the service, the girls working seemed clueless, knowing we were there to pick up our food but ignoring us and helping others. We asked \"Is that our food?\" and the girl goes \"Yeah!\" We we're both standing by the register and she walked away to help customers in line. We had already paid online..so no wait was really necessary.  The only problem was the food was too far behind the counter for us to take it. When she came back we were like...\"Can we take it?\" and she was like \"Sure!\" and pushed it 2 inches closer! The only person here that has a clue is the owner!!"}
{"text":"A very quaint shop in Kensington Market right off of Spadina that I happen to stumble upon last month.  I've tried quite a few poke places in Vancouver and wanted to see if Toronto offered anything better.  Was going to get the Big Wave but the tuna/sesame in the Hawaii classic stopped me there.  Just something about that combination that always get me.  I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of fish they put on - not too little in that I needed to ration, but not too much so that I could still get full.  Not to mention, that seaweed infused rice was something different than other places I've tried and the taro chips were on point.  The best part was it tasted better than it looks.  The tuna was light and perfectly flavoured-- not too saucy, not too salty, but still had that freshness you'd come to expect. It wasn't drenched in sauce that I needed more rice to mellow out the taste.  I'll go back for the other flavours when I'm in that area again."}
{"text":"Awesome little restaurant in Kensington market. We had the Big Wave and Waimea bowl...loved the heat in the Waimea. The Regular size bowl is deceptively filling and the fish to rice ratio was great. Also recommend trying the Misubi with teriyaki sauce ...definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try North Poké but I left disappointed. The service was really slow considering we were the only ones there. I normally believe in quality over quantity but the quality was not to par neither was the quantity."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as it is close to work and has all these great reviews. But the marinate for the sashimi is so bad. For me, the sashimi is the star of the show if any poke bowl. So if the sashimi tastes bitter and really no other taste, it's hard for me to finish the bowl. The portion for the sashimi was good though."}
{"text":"One of the better poke places I've been to.  I tried the Hawaii classic and added avocado. Prices are standard. I believe $14 is a little steep for a lunch, which I ended up paying with tax and tip. The Sashimi is one of the freshest I've had and I love how it is marinated for added flavour.  It was delicious but I would only go if I were in the area. Otherwise, I would hit up Rollatation."}
{"text":"Ordered a regular salmon bowl and a small tuna bowl on Uber Eats. It didn't look big but was quite filling for two people. The bowls came with rice (though you can choose from a few bases), taro chips, seaweed salad, avocado and fish. Everything was fresh and the flavours were really good. The fish comes in a nice sauce that isn't overpowering. I'll definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"TL;DR The Real Deal. No seriously the poke combos here are magnificent. The Hawaiian Classic is a MUST. I mean regardless of what you order it always comes with avocados. Where's the con?  FOOD (5/5) It seems like I give them too much credit after only being my first time but for being SO GOOD I MEAN, first impressions matter alot don't they? The Hawaiian Classic is salty and savoury like being at the sea catching a fresh ahi and basking in the glory of the sun. The Waimea is a twist off of that shitty Spicy Salmon you get at sushi places with Togarashi Aoili to compensate and boy I respect that.   These guys respect their fish let me tell you.  SERVICE (5/5) Is it just me or do I really love it when people leave me alone to stare at the menu. Like if I need help I'll ask??? I'm sure this wasn't intentional and the people working were like \"eh whatever ecksdee\" but I LOVE THAT. MY SOCIAL ANXIETY CAN'T HANDLE CONFRONTATIONS WHEN I JUST WANNA READ THE ELABORATE MENU AND DECIDE THROUGH PROCESS OF ELIMINATION. So thank you.   ATMOSPHERE (5/5) Cozy. Warm Window Seats. Lovely RELAXING Music. Not too loud even when there was quite a few people. Just a very chill place. I would live here.   I definately need to come back multiple times and eat everything to see if I need to knock off a star or if they can keep my 5 stars at bay. Thanks for having me!"}
{"text":"Cute little shop with really nice staff. The tofu is very good and uses the same marinade as the Ahi tuna dish \"Hawaii classic\". Fresh ingredients, delicious seaweed salad, and fresh fish including east coast Atlantic tuna and line-caught salmon from Indonesia or Trinidad. I'm not much for them serving octopus but that's because I don't eat things that are smarter than me. ;-) The marinades and sauces are delicious and there is a perfect balance of other veg or rice in the portion size. Can't wait for summer to try a shave ice here!"}
{"text":"Love their poke bowls! The perfect combination of textures and flavours! I typically get the waimea. It has a creamy raw salmon topping, sushi rice with nori, crispy taro chips, seaweed salad, crispy onions etc. I get cravings of their pokebowls in the middle of the night which is not good! My only comment to them is: don't scrimp on the ingredients. There are some inconsistencies with the amount of raw fish and taro chips. Don't scrimp on the taro chips since they give the dish crunchiness which goes well with all the other sticky components. So far this is my fav poke stop."}

{"text":"North Poke has been on my list for months - after all, you can only read \"but not as much protein as North\" in other poke reviews so many times before you realize you need to see the real deal for yourself. And though I liked North Poke, I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan. It's true, the protein is plentiful. I also really enjoyed the taro chips atop my Waimea bowl (and the fact that they have a snack size? Fantastic!) but there was something about my meal that was just not right, and I sense it was this very \"fishy\" flavour emanating from the dish that didn't quite do it for me. As a poke aficionado I've had my fair share of fresh salmon and tuna (or so I'd like to think!) but comparable places served fish that was fresher - in my view. I'm sure there will be many to disagree with me as North has come to be an extremely popular joint for getting one's poke fix, but it just wasn't my favourite (I would say Lahuna can't be beat). The taro chips, however - crazy good. You've gotta try them!"}
{"text":"I have their Waimea salmon and Molokai salmon in a salad bowl every lunch at their location at Hudson's Bay /Saks Pusateri foodhall downtown.  Very fresh salmon, avocado seaweed salad, taro chips.  Line moves fast even at busy lunch time."}
{"text":"Note: this review is ONLY for the shave ice, not for the poke.   Hawaiian shave ice is special; it doesn't just taste like a snow cone. You know, the pure sugar juice that tastes like a melted freezie and then crushed ice that you get bored of almost instantly. Nope.   In Hawaii this treat is massively elevated and has a special texture that is closer  to sorbet or even ice-cream. The sauces are made in house; there are tropical add-ins; it is shaved ice but it somehow comes together for a smooth texture. You will likely want to share a shave ice but you will both finish it with glee.  At Ululani's there are famous flavour combos like the Sunset Beach (Guava, Mango, Passion Orange), the No Ka Oi (Coconut, Mango, Liliko'i), Local Motion (Mango, Li Hing Mui, Pineapple - topped with Li Hing Mui Powder) or Coconut Lovers (Coconut, Tiger's Blood, Pina Colada, toasted coconut).   North Poke didn't come close to any of the described experience.   While I truly appreciate the effort of bringing the idea to Toronto and the adorable presentation, the taste and texture of my shave ice was unsatisfactory. It literally tasted like grainy ice and whatever syrups (and not enough, for that matter). Yes, it was a subpar North American snow cone. For this concept to succeed, the unique texture of a real Hawaiian shave ice will need to be worked on and perfected.   Keep up the work, North Poke!"}
{"text":"I really like north poke, the prices are pretty decent for the amount of food you get. My recommendation would be the hawaiian classic, perfect amount of flavouring and always gets me to come back for more. I usually dont get the taro chips with my poke but they always offer to give me more seaweed salad which I never say no to. Whats great is that they also offer the sampler where you can choose 3 snack size bowls for $15, so if you cant decide on which one to get, you can have 3!The staff is friendly and the poke is fresh. This is definitely one of the top poke stops in Toronto."}
{"text":"I had high expectations from North Poke as they pre-marinate their fish just as you'd find in Hawaii and they didn't add weird toppings such as mango or edamame. The pickled onions, wakame, taro chips and fried shallots were delicious additives, but the poke itself just wasn't good. I ordered the Waimea which is like a spicy salmon and there were large chunks and strips of fat and skin in it which I wouldn't expect to find in poke. The fish wasn't fresh so it left a fishy after taste. The worst part of the bowl was the RICE! It was soooo mushy and hot that it warmed up all the salmon by the time I started eating it. It's also not flavoured the way you'd expect from Sushi rice, it's just plain rice. It would have been much better if it were it were cooked with way less water, cooled down and mixed with rice vinegar before adding to the bowl."}
{"text":"This is now my favourite poke place after trying so many that have popped up recently. Their model is \"authentic Hawaiian\", which is where poke originated and is what makes this place a gem. Less is more is definitely what comes to mind when digging into one of their poke bowl offerings. Unlike many other poke places that have sprouted, North Poke really focuses on the fish with their marinades over the liberal amounts of toppings you'd get elsewhere. With North Poke, you can really tell from the taste, the marinated fish is high quality and this is what poke is about. Nothing overpowering, but still complex with lots of flavour with just the essential ingredients and a hint of creative toppings. This is truly what keeps me returning. After tasting North Poke, I'm hooked and I can't go back to any others. The portions of a large bowl is very filling and they do give quite a bit of protein. I ended up with more fish than rice on my last bite! If you've always wanted to try Hawaiian poke, this place is a must, they're the real deal!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I came back for a sponsored Yelp Elite Event.  Building off my first review,  I was really delighted to see that improvements were made to the quality of the food since my last visit (taro chips were no longer stale and ingredients were well-dispersed throughout the pan).   I had the opportunity to try nearly all of their featured poke bowl selections and I found that the sashimi cuts were bouncy-fresh, deeply infused with flavourful marinade, and the bowls were topped with all sorts of delicious toppings that texturally complemented the fish. However, I found the Ono (octopus) choice to be a little bit strange, as I did not particularly enjoy the potato/octopus combination of textures or flavours. I would probably recommend the less adventurous, non-local, average Joe to just stick to the sashimi bowls! I found shack special to be the least spicy and probably my favourite out of all of them."}
{"text":"Delicious poke.  Simple food that comes in snack, medium and large size.  What a great idea.  Super easy to order as it is by size.  You can order 3 snack size poke bowl for $15. What a great deal!  I tried the Waimea and it was delicious and inventive.  The fish was well-seasoned and there was a lotus root chip that came with it that made it extra special.  The setup is welcoming and laid-back like a true poke place.  Will definitely come back here again to try the other flavours!"}
{"text":"The Shack Bowl was the best Poké I've ever tried. It's redeemed the name of Poké bowls for me. Don't go to any other place but this one."}
{"text":"This place is a 4.5/5 for me! 3/$15 snack size - that's what we got because we love trying everything! It is small, but it's not 2 bite size small.   We ordered the shack special, hawaii and the ono. The shack special was salmon based - creamy but had a standard taste compared to other poke places even though it had kimchi and gochuchang marinade. I liked the hawaii classic the most. Ahi tuna was the protein, the combination of the ingredients gave it great texture and flavour that worked wonderfully together. My least favourite was the ono. Octopus was the protein and it definitely had a great grilled flavour. This bowl was a tad too citrusy for my liking.  The taro chips that were topped on the poke bowls were crispy and very yummy. This place is tiny located at Kensington market, with a few chairs by the window but it does give off a cute island vibe! Fresh ingredients, definitely a great place to try poke bowls."}
{"text":"There are only a handful of places where I take my wife and she's actually impressed.  That's how I can start off this review because really it says a lot.  Many of the places I like and really enjoy going to for her they're just meh.  It's not like she has standards in the clouds or anything like that it's just that she's not into food like I am.  She's rather indifferent of where we go to eat sometimes and it's always my choice with little to no input from her.    This past weekend we had a Jays game to go to and being at North Poke just several weeks back for a tasting and sampling I thought this was something that I thought she'd really enjoy.  While she's not as enthusiastic about sushi, sashimi and other raw fish type meals, she will eat them.  I tried to remind her that she had poke in Florida last fall and she had really no recollection of her meal there so I had to kind of explain what it was so she had a bit of a refresher.  Basically poke is a bowl of marinated raw fish mixed with a different things served on rice or if starch is not your thing you can have it as a salad instead.  That is basically the easiest way to explain what this menu item is really.  Poke is a Hawaiian thing.  I was told about it quite a few years ago but seeing as how we've not yet been to Hawaii I can understand how such a native type dish wouldn't necessarily make its way across the Pacific.  That was then, this is now.  Poke can pretty much be easily found here in Toronto as well as other foods that were  new at one time like those sushi/burritos or bao sandwiches.  It's safe to say stuff from Asia flies well here in TO but hey, Hawaii is the most remote place on the planet that is, being within proximity of any other place, it's all alone in the middle of the largest ocean on the planet.  Still, this dish made it's way here and we're not even on the west coast...  Located on the south side of Baldwin between Kensington and Spadina, North Poke is in quite the busy location pretty much in central Kensington Market where many of the other diverse tastes of the city exist in such a small tight knit neighborhood.  It's obvious that from first site this place has a theme and their theme is of those Pacific islands where Spam and surfboards are a part of the culture.    Now where some places may just add rice to a bowl and top if off with sashimi and just drizzle sauce on top, North Poke has their fish marinating in a display very much like a gelato bar where you can see the trays of goodness under glass if you wanted to get a good peek at the choices before making your own bowl selection.  For the both of us we ended up choosing the Hawaiian Classic and the Waimei.  The Classic I had just recently which I enjoyed and since it had tuna I wanted the other bowl to have salmon so we could both have a variety.  The Classic is as follows:  Sesame shoyu marinade, nori, cucumber, ahi tuna, green onions,fried shallots, toasted sesame where as the the Waimei was:  salmon, togarashi mayo, tobiko, sesame, green onions, red onions, fried shallots, edamame and both choices were on rice.  We ended up getting large portions (the round Chinese take out container sizes with the black bottoms) and I have to say these are VERY filling as far as servings go.  The portion is in fact large and the ingredients are all fresh, tasty and quite plentiful.  The amount of fish that made up each was a great proportion to the rice and the rest of the servings.  The fried shallots as well as the taro chips add a nice change of texture adding a crunch factor while the entire bowl is a great change of pace to what I would normally eat on any given weekend.  The beauty of this meal is that it's not only filling and great tasting but also a nice healthier alternative to change things up.  Another thing is it's affordable and with the Yelp check in for 10% off a medium or large it's even a better deal!    Because this meal is a refreshing change and they make it very well, North Poke will be one of our new go to spots.  Oh I almost forgot to mention that my wife was impressed."}
{"text":"It's taste good except the fish did not taste fresh at the Kensington location. I heard the fish is fresher at the pop-up location in Pusateri."}
{"text":"Having only recently discovered Poke, and not entirely getting what this craze, that seemed to be sweeping the city up was all about, i decided that it was high-time that I tried some.  I did a quick search for \"best Poke in Toronto\" and immediately came across North Poke on Blogto.  The Kensington location was in reasonable proximity to my place of work, so one bright sunny afternoon a few months back I decided to venture out and take the Poke plunge....  Needless to say, North Poke was worth the review.  I haven't been on Yelp in quite some time, and was waiting for a bit of inspiration, and found it in the form of raw fish.  There is nothing that I can say that hasn't already been said, and I am no doubt reiterating what you may have already heard, but I will nonetheless say it once more, North Poke is a MUST.  On my first visit I had the Big Wave, which consisted of albacore tuna with a jalepeno citrus marinade, black garlic mayo and bits of tenkasu.  The latter which I had to wiki and found that it is essentially deep fried flour-batter, which provided a satisfying crunch.    Full disclosure, I went back the next three days straight.  On subsequent visits I had both the salmon, and Ahi tuna Molokai, which was a bit on the spicy side, but spicy in the best of ways.  I can't believe that I waited as long as I have for Poke, now it is all that I think about.  If anyone is in doubt, don't be NP is the real deal!"}
{"text":"North Poke has a variety of different Poke bowls. They assemble it with care and it's unbelievably delicious. It's in Kensington market area with cheap underground parking close by. My sister and I got the Waimai, Ono and Molokai bowls with brown rice. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Still my favourite poke place in Toronto. I've only had it at a few other places, but this place by far has the most generous protein portion. Fish is well marinated and everything is always consistent."}
{"text":"Food was fresh. Quality was on par with the Kensington location. I'm so happy that they're here, because it's super close to me now! Friendly staff. There is a bit of a line during lunch but it moves fast. Happy to have a new affordable lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This was my first poke experience and I was impressed!   I ordered the regular-sized \"Hawaii classic\" poke bowl. Not gonna lie, at first I was a bit disappointed by the size of the bowl and was expecting a bit more. Joke's on me because the bowl actually ended up being quite filling!   I went there on a cold snowy day, but I feel like I would enjoy a bowl of poke more on a warm sunny day. Oh well, I'll definitely have to come back in the summer."}
{"text":"Hubby, wifey along with the Porkiebun took a detour on the way home to grab some poke bowl.   Wifey has been dying to try this place out because of her unhealthy obsession with spam.  Hubby had the large Waimea bowl. Wifey had the same but just a regular size and also ordered three teriyaki spam musubi. Wifey and little porkiebun enjoyed the musubi (but that may just be bias towards wifey spam obsession). Hubby liked his Waimea bowl but was not overly fond of it as he was with another poke joint. Hubby thought it was on the dry side with less options for toppings. Wifey felt like there was too much rice in the bowl that did not balance well with the portion of the other ingredients. However, fish and the marinade was so fresh and delicious. Taro chips was also a good addition.   If you love food that is underwhelming in sauces and just wish to enjoy the plainness and freshness of the poke bowl then this is a place to go.  Staff were friendly. Interior is cute and quaint. No seating at all."}
{"text":"Yum! This is a great spot for poke, with fairly reasonable prices for how filling you feel. The bowls don't Iook that big, but they feel big in your stomach! I tried the classic hawaiian in regular to go, and it was delicious. My only contention is that because the bowl was so small and there were so many ingredients packed in, it was hard to mix to get the right flavour evenly. I guess that's a good problem to have!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to check this place out since it open but never had the chance. I recently found out that they opened a pop up shop at Pusateri's at the Bay and knew this was my chance. I've since had it twice since they've set up and I have no idea why I waited so long to try it out. Had the Hawaiian and Molokai and both are amazing, fresh fish, friendly service, and really good seaweed salad! I hope you guys stick around downtown!!!"}
{"text":"This is your average poke, nothing over the top to distinguish from other poke stores. I got the traditional salmon bowl with rice as well as the watermelon and peach shaved ice.  ----About the food---- The bowl came with a spoonful of salmon which was good, but the quantity was lacking considering the size of the bowl was smaller than normal. There was alot of rice packed into bottom of the bowl (I would say around 40% of the entire dish was rice.) The seaweed was nice and fresh and tasted refreshing. The taro chips were actually crispy and delicious. With all things considered it's a good dish but it's pricier than other stores. The shaved ice was refreshing (watermelon is better than peach imo.)   ----About the service---- One thing that irked me was after I paid and went to my seat, I noticed that we get a free seaweed salad on the side for checking in. I went up and asked if we can get the salad but they refused because we had to do it while we paid. Doesn't make sense to me why it was such a big deal. Service left a bad taste in my mouth. (this isn't directed at all the staff, just the one I spoke with)"}
{"text":"My all time favourite poke place. I've tried a lot of poke in Toronto, and none of them quite match up to North Poke.   This place offers authentic style poke, and has the cutest little shop ever. What I like most about this place is that all the fish is marinated and the bowls/menu is pretty much already set. At other places, it just seems like you're assembling your own burrito bowl.   I love the combinations they offer and I would highly recommend the Waimea and Molokai."}
{"text":"**This review is only for the shave ice**  While my niece and I were walking up and down Kensington Market, I had mentioned that one of the things that I've always wanted to try was Hawaiian shave ice in Hawaii. We stumbled upon North Poke and it was like a mirage appeared because this shop was probably the closest thing comparable to Hawaii!  The fresh smell of fish for poke was enticing, but I was still full from an AYCE lunch earlier, boo. There were two sizes to choose from, regular and large. We opted to share a regular with two syrup choices (we chose peach and strawberry) with condensed ice. The staff used a legit ice shaving machine. You can start eating it with a spoon and use a straw to drink it afterward. There's limited seating inside the restaurant but we were able to get a window seat. It was a flavorful, light dessert that's definitely shareable. Hopefully I can go to Hawaii in the near future to try shave ice there!"}
{"text":"I've been dying to give this place a try with all the IG hype. Can't find a better place that serves poke anywhere else in Toronto! Poke is what I miss most about Hawaii (aside from the sunshine and beaches) ever since I came back from my trip last summer.  Service at this place is great - the staff are super friendly, it's only their third day and they are doing their best to be efficient.   Food wise, fish is fresh and flavorful . I tried the  Hawaii classic and hanalei. I think I like the Hawaii classic better because of its rich flavor with the soy sauce dressing. But if you prefer a plain dressing to bring out the flavor of the fish, hanalei might suit your taste. It is citrusy which goes well with the ginger of the dish.  The price is fair given the quantity and quality of the food.  Definitely coming back for more poke!!!"}
{"text":"Outside of Hawaii, this is the best. Good prices for the sample bowl. Very fresh. We had the Hawaiian classic and it was very tasty. Can't wait for shave ice season."}
{"text":"I've tried other poke places since they started popping up in Toronto. I never fully got hooked on any of the places I went to...until now.   After trying this place I crave their bowls. I find them well balanced and not skimpy on the fish. They offer a lot of different flavours / options of meat. They offer vegetarian options too.   The pros: -well priced -lots of variety from savoury foods to dessert -quick service and doesn't take a long time to get your food -quality toppings  -good flexibility/variety of accommodating different people's dietary needs -very filling  -variety in sizes   The only con I can say is their location being too small as well as the difficulty of getting there unless you are heading into Kensington market."}
{"text":"Not my favorite poke ever, but not bad either. We shared a Big Wave on white rice in size large. At just under $15, it's not cheap, but at least they didn't skimp out on the fish. In terms of toppings, the one that stands out distinctly is the taro chip. It was oddly sweet. Taro isn't naturally sugary sweet. I think they added sugar somewhere in the process, and I'd much rather it not have been sweetened. The Big Wave is albacore tuna. It was rather mushy. Tasty, but mushy. Maybe next time, we'll pick a different one and it'll be better."}
{"text":"I got the shack special, which is salmon, gochujang dressing, kimchi crema, daikon, fried onions, and green onions. I also got it by weight, which was $5.50/100g. Perhaps it was just that the girl serving me was inexperienced, but it took a while to process my order. She had to get someone else's help and that person then had to retake my order after the first girl had already scooped up my poke for me. For those who aren't as knowledgeable about weight, 100g (or well, 110g because they scooped a little bit more) is about 2 rounded ice cream scoops. For $6 before tax, that's not cheap. If there's a next time, I'm going to do the snack bowl. I'm hoping it's better for value. That being said, the poke itself was quite tasty. It's only mildly, and I mean extremely mildly spicy. The salmon was nice and firm, and I loved the extra crunch from the fried onions and the daikon slices were refreshing. I also quite appreciated that this poke comes pre-marinated, which is, to my knowledge, the way its traditionally done."}
{"text":"I'm a recent poke addict and decided to try this place out. What I like about this place compared to other places is that you can get the regular sized dish for $10-11 and be satisfied in the end. Other poke places in Toronto often offer a $10-11 option, but I didn't feel satisfied in the end. In other words, good bang for the buck.  I ordered The Big Wave as I had never tried albacore tuna poke before and it was delicious. I asked the girl behind the counter what she feels is their best poke and she recommended Hawaii Classic. I plan to go back there soon so I can try it out."}
{"text":"Having been to a few Poke places in the city, I'm glad to have stumbled across North Poke. They're different, and while I'm no poke expert, North Poke just tastes extremely authentic. It tastes like you really are in Hawaii, having a bowl of poke. To capture that, is amazing, so kudos to North Poke!  I merely came here for a snack and was impressed by the wide variety of options they have here and settled for the Waimea bowl in snack size. I'm was already impressed they had a snack size at around $6, and it was just the perfect size. I asked the man over the counter which ones featured spicy mayo and was told the waimea was the classic one for that, the other option being the molokai, without the mayo but features chilies to bring the heat.   Anyways, everything in the bowl was so fresh and delicate. There was even a tad warmness coming from the rice, the avocados were just ripe and soft enough, there literally was a melt-in-you-mouth freshness here. The onions added such an interesting element to the bowl. Powerful, yet it works. The fish was perfectly marinated, and it was creamy. Personal taste comment here, but I felt I could have used some more sweetness in the bowl. The seaweed salad supplies that but once that goes, so does the sweetness in the bowl.   I'm already thinking about my next visit here! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"It's soooo good. We got the three snack size for $15 dollars and it was worth every single penny and even more. You get three bowls filled to the top and garnished with sugar dusted taro chips, seaweed salad and pickled onions. Definitely enough food to feed two hungry people or three more or less hungry people!  The fish is fresh and you have a large selection of poke to choose from- ranging from the mayo based to the soy based. I loved that the poke didnt feel too heavy and oily (unlike some other types of poke that are drenched in mayo).   I'm making this place my summer lunch place"}
{"text":"Portion to price still slightly below other poke joints in the city. Quality however continue to be excellent."}
{"text":"Decent portions, rice was dry and hard and plain, salmon tasted old, just go to poke box.."}
{"text":"I can't stand sashimi but I LOVE poke bowls: the different textures, delicious sauces and tongue tingling spices all contained in one neat package has won my heart over.  North Poke is an adorable little eatery with eight stools and bar tables set up against the front windows. The Filipino male worker (sorry didn't get his name) was such a doll! We chatted him up about the menu before deciding on the following:  - Molokai poke bowl - ahi tuna, sweet soy marinade, sambal crema, jalepeno, pickled shallots,nori, watermelon radish, green onions. YUM! - Waimea poke bowl - salmon, togarashi mayo, tobiko, sesame, green onions, red onions, fried shallots, edamame. Delish! - Spam Musubi - hmmmm tasted like they used a generic brand of meat. The flavors were a miss. - Hawaiian Shave Ice (it's not \"shaved\" there's no \"d\") half Blueberry and Tiger's Blood (watermelon, coconut and strawberry). Not overly sweet but nice and light, good enough to complete our meal. I was surprised that it took a long time to melt, we took our time eating it.  Our little helper happily obliged when we asked him if we could sample the octopus and scallop. The octopus was deliciously smoky like they grilled it, and the scallop tasted vinegary like cerviche which I loved.   My friend and I had fun taking selfies with the leis that we took off the wall hooks, and also our moustache straws. Would gladly come back for their scrumptious poke bowls and excellent service."}
{"text":"Had some serious poke cravings after my trip to Hawaii earlier this year and decided to come to North Poke for lunch since I work nearby.  The menu is simple, you pick a size ( 3 different sizes, base (sushi rice, brown rice or salad) and your choice of fish.  I ordered the ahi tuna Molokai basically tuna with sweet soy sauce, spicy mayo and some jalapeños along with similar toppings as other options.  Being a lover of seaweed salad, seaweed and taro chips, I dig the toppings ( although authentic Hawaiian doesn't include toppings). The tuna was very underwhelming. It was mushy, stringy poorly. cut- can't compare to the quality found at decent Toronto restaurants and definitely no where close to quality of tuna found in Hawaii. I didn't try the salmon so can't comment on that.  Tip: don't forgot to check in on Yelp for some extra seaweed in your bowl."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a poke bowl. It's like sushi in a bowl! My daughter and I each got the regular size bowls. I got a #2 Molokai and she got the #5 wimei. The fish was fresh and the side ingredients went well together. Not much seating in the store, just a few window bar seats."}
{"text":"I was not super impressed by this place, it's a bit hard to find and it's essentially a counter in pusateri's market.  It's very much an assembly line and super packed during lunch hour.  The portion is pretty small so if you're a big eater you would probably need the large and still might be hungry.  The food itself tastes fine and service is slow.  Be prepared to wait about 15 minutes and service is also smile-free.  Don't like feeling like a number?  Don't come here.  I don't think service is what they are going for.  But go for it, if you like to feel like paying a lot and having a charge for pusateri's on your card.  I think the other poke places in the city I have tried were better in my opinion."}
{"text":"I ordered the bowl of poke that has spicy salmon, scallions, avocado brown rice and Taro chips on top. Flavors were actually very good and melded well together.   There were many options and sizes that you could get for your poke. I liked how you could get a small portion as a snack instead of just having having a regular or a large size.  I will definitely come back and try their other flavors."}
{"text":"I had a really poor first poke experience (I'm looking at you, Big Tuna Poke Bar!), and I've been a bit skeptical to try more poke ever since. It just seemed like an overhyped, overpriced fad. However, North Poke proved me wrong!  Went here tonight with my boyfriend, and we tried the Big Wave and the Hawaii Classic. We both ordered the regular size, which was $10.95 each. I thought the price was very reasonable. The size is deceiving - it looks like a very shallow dish, and I thought it wouldn't fit much, but at the end I was completely full (and I didn't even have lunch today!). The fish was soft, fresh, and plentiful and tossed well in the dressings. The toppings were generous (seaweed salad, onions, avocado, cucumber, etc.) and each bowl came with two large, crispy, taro chips on the side. The rice was a bit hard and clumpy, though a bit of mixing everything together with my fork seemed to make it less noticeable. Note that the Hawaii Classic claims lists macadamia nuts as one of the toppings, but I could not detect any in my bowl. Didn't really bother me either way, though.  What I liked was that it was simple and easy to order. It's not like with some build-your-own-poke places, where you are bombarded with endless options for toppings, sauces, and add-ons; that can get overwhelming!  I forgot to check in on Yelp for 10% off, but I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Second time coming to try this place out. Certain menu items has changed since the last time I was here. I must say the flavor of the food has definitely improved since last time! The salmon and tuna bowl had a good amount of spicy dressing, making it more flavorful while consuming it with rice. I also got the one with the octopus. The octopus wasn't for me not because of flavor but more of texture. They all come with seaweed salad and big, crispy taro chips. Great if you're looking something to fill your tummy but not too heavy."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, Great food, and so afforable!  Got the classic Hawaiian Poke, and it was so great! Wanted to try poke for a long time. Fresh fish, warm rice, awesome flavours. Perfect for a nice summer day. So refreshing. Will definitely return in the future!"}
{"text":"Good poke! Not many add ons as expected. Ordered the snack bowl and with sushi rice and filled me up, the regular bowl would have been too much for me. Considering its convenient location I am coming back for sure, but take in mind that this is not the best poke you will find in Toronto."}
{"text":"Overdue review. I came here for a Yelp elite event. I have to say, of all the poke places I have tried, I enjoy this one the best.  The owners and staff take so much care and attention into their poke bowls. They pre-marinate their fish prior to serving, which gives the entire bowl so much flavour and taste. My big qualm about poke bowls is often there's not enough flavour. Not this one!  Another unique thing is that they hand picked beers that would go well with the poke bowls. Detailed oriented and selective. It just gives me warm feelings that they are passionate about what they do, which makes me want to return, and not see pokes as a fad.   They make everything fresh and throw out unused stuff day to day.  Prices are on par with other poke places. I love how they brought Hawaii here with their spam, shaved ices, and coconut drinks!  Way to go North Poke!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Loved the opportunity to try various snack sizes, all the fish was amazing and tasted extremely fresh.  The employees here were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Found this gem walking through the Kensington market and it was awesome! The pickled onions and seaweed became my favorite thing. I would say everything was super fresh and they let you pick two fish options, rice and salad. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. Would def go again!"}
{"text":"North Poke is a great place for a salmon or tuna bowl in Kensington Market.   The bowls at North Poke come with a base of salad or rice topped with tuna or salad. The Hawaiian Classic is a great introduction to the place.  In addition to placing some tuna on top of the salad/rice, the bowl contains sesame seeds, avocado, onion, and other seasoning.  Bowls come in snack (5.95), regular (10.95) and large (14.95) sizes.  Seating here is very limited. Plan on getting your bowl to go.  The tuna is very fresh and the bowls are delicious. If there is one quibble- at times the bowls can be a bit salty. Perhaps ask that they not add salt when they prepare your bowl."}
{"text":"I've had Poke in Hawaii, but this was my first time in Toronto, and I have to say North Poke delivers on its promise on authentic Hawaiian experience. Right at the front, the different 'flavours' (different marinade with different fish) are there for you to choose to go on your poke bowl. A regular ($10.95) is a great lunch size. It's mostly for take-out but there are a couple of seats.  The bowl comes in your choice of rice or salad, and topped with your selected poke, some seaweed salad, sesame seeds, onion, avocado and taro chips. I got to try the Waimea and Hawaiian Classic, both very delicious! The tuna and salmon were both well marinaded and nicely portioned. It goes so well with the warm rice. It's the fresh taste and combination of flavours and textures that make it so good for me.  North poke really seems to respect the ingredients and how everything is done, and I will be sure to come back to try some more!"}
{"text":"My first time ever eating Poke. I had the 3 for $15 special - Octopus, Salmon and Tuna. Nom nom nom nom! Asked for Taro Chips with the Poke. It was delicious. Make sure to mix the Poke thoroughly.   Seating on stools near the window only. Which is great if it is rainy and the place and street outside are both quiet."}
{"text":"Had a Hawaiian Classic which I ate over the garbage can because all the other counter spots were taken and rather than put the garbage can somewhere else, it's standing under the counter where I ate my Hawaiian Classic. The Hawaiian Classic itself was ok. Fresh chunks of tuna in stuff on white rice w/ some seaweed. Tastes ok, but there's no options for toppings like at other poke joints."}
{"text":"It seems like Poké restaurants are popping up everyone.  I prefer North Poké over the others because the ingredients and flavours are very fresh and taste authentic. I've tried a few items and enjoyed all of them. They were all full of flavours and had great ingredients. My go to is the Waimea which includes salmon and the togarashi aioli. And don't forget to get the spam masubi."}
{"text":"Second time visiting was MUCH better than the first. The owner reached out and wanted to correct what happened with my previous visit (see previous review) and informed me that the city wanted them to do some upgrades and that was the reason for their closure. Which I 100 percent appreciate and am glad that the owner cares enough to look and take reviews into consideration. After trying all the options they have I was really surprised that my favourite was the ONO the one with cooked octopus! As well, I really enjoy the taro chips that they put in with the poke, I would probably just go to get some of the chips and the fish by itself and make myself hawaiian nachos. My top 3 have to be the ONO, Waimea and the Big Wave. The ONO is really good sitting on a bed of salad instead of rice. One thing I would love would be an actual seating area, which is obviously not going to happen easily in a smaller place but maybe something to consider for a second location one day. Overall, I'll definitely return here over other poke places in the area."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of tasting some of North Poke's most popular Poke flavours during an Yelp event and I was absolutely hooked on its healthy and delicious Poke bowls.   Even though many Sushi Burrito restaurants also have Poke bowls on their menu, North Poke distinguishes itself by providing traditional Hawaiian style Poke. Furthermore, they are committed in environmental sustainability, and providing fresh and high quality ingredients for its customers. During the event, I learned that they would only make a certain amount of a specific flavour everyday, and if one flavour is sold out, they would not make more, because they want to ensure that the customers are getting the most consistent quality of fish.   There are many flavours of salmon/tuna/octopus toppings to choose from, and they have vegetarian flavours as well. The ingredients of the flavours are listed on the menu, which can also be found on their website. When you order, you first choose whether you want rice or salad as your base, then you select your seafood topping. After that, they then assemble your Poke bowl with seaweed salad, taro chips, avocado, onion slices, roasted garlic, and some green onions. During my visit, they were pretty generous with the portions, as the Poke bowl was really filling and one bowl was definitely enough for me for dinner.   I also really enjoyed the Hawaiian themed decor at the restaurant as it adds more character to the cuisine that I was enjoying. I highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and I can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"The fish they use for the poke tastes extremely fresh. This and Calii Love might be my favorite Poke spots in the GTA."}
{"text":"I ordered the shack special, it was okay. I felt that it was pricy for the amount I'm getting. I did like the service and the options of portions. However a regular is on the small side for me. I felt the dish was not so flavourful. even though, there was chips in the dish, I felt that adding more crunch and some salt would have made the dish tasty. There is soy sauce at the restaurant so you can add it in (i did). But i think a sweet soy sauce in the dish would be great in bring out the flavours. Anyways side from flavour, the experience was interesting."}
{"text":"Great food. Definitely recommend! I've been here many times and always find myself dropping by whenever I'm in the area. It's always fresh and the flavour is amazing - which you don't always get with other Poke places in this city."}
{"text":"I'll be the first to admit that I'm no poke connoisseur. I haven't traveled the world in search of the best poke, nor have I ventured around Hawaii, the motherland of poke, in order to determine what makes an authentic poke authentic. Thankfully, the folks over at North Poke seem to have spared me the legwork. With the poke explosion in Toronto over the past year, I've had a handful of experiences with poke at various different places. And based on this, I'd have to say that North Poke is a winner.  First off, the freshness of the ingredients here deserve some commendation. Much better than any other poke place I've seen. Second, I find the proportion of ingredients to be well balanced in the bowl. The amount of rice is just about right, unlike some other places that skimp out on the toppings by overloading you with rice. Lastly, I find the balance of flavours to be pleasant. Some other places tend to drench the bowl with some sort of sauce, almost to the point of making it a porridge. If that's the type of flavour or experience you're looking for, North Poke probably wouldn't be right for you.  Taking all this in consideration with the serving sizes and prices, I'd say North Poke delivers excellent value. This is rare for trendy food establishments, where they often find a way to charge you a \"hip\" premium. All in all, I am quite pleased with this place."}
{"text":"This is a great place to pick up a quick lunch. Love the different options they have and they let me do half/half rice salad base, which I very much appreciated! I tried the Shack Special, which seems to be a favourite. Salmon seemed real fresh, and the serving size is quite generous. Loved the crunch that the taro chips provided. There's a whole lot of deliciousness going on in such a small bowl!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here for lunch and ordered the three snack size poke bowl for $15.  Part of my decision on getting the snack size was because the containers for it was super cute.  10% off on your order if you check in on Yelp.  I tried the shack special, ono and Hawaii classic.  My favorite was the Hawaii classic - ahi tuna was delish!  My least favorite was the ono - the octopus was too chewy.  If you're hungry, you'll probably need two snack size to fill you up.  I really enjoyed the poke bowl and will def be back sometime soon for more!"}
{"text":"When I was in Hawaii, I hung out by the grocery store for a long while taste testing each of their varieties of poke.  I was super stoked when poke came to Toronto, and even more stoked that one opened close to work!  I've been twice and used Ritual to order.  It's great, because it takes less than 10 minutes for them to prepare, and I get to skip the line up. However, if you go in store you can get three snack bowls for $15.  I've tried the Waimea and the Hawaii Classic and found both very fresh and tasty.  For me, a snack bowl is filling enough.  I find the bowls pretty worth it, because the quality is comparable to my high quality supermarket poke, and also the fish is super fresh.  If you are on a gluten free diet, there are gluten free options.  In terms of seating, there's only a few seats by the window and cashier.  The first time I went, my boyfriend and I shared a seat on the bench.  It was hard balancing ourselves on this bench...maybe because I had too much delicious poke in me!  Overall, if you want a taste of Hawaii, this is pretty close to what it gets."}
{"text":"I was super excited about this place because I really enjoyed poke from Hawaii. The service was good and the staff was super friendly.  However, the poke did not live up to the expectation. The musubi was decent. I tried the Shack Special and the Hawaii classic. The Shack Special tasted very plain, whereas the Hawaii classic was on the salty side. They did not resemble the poke from Hawaii, perhaps because it was more of a fusion style? Portion-wise, the \"large\" bowls for ~$10 were tiny. They were generous in terms of fish I guess, but too little rice. It was more like a snack size, and not worth the $10 IMO.    Update Apr 2018 So after many dining experiences at other poke places, I decided to give North Poke another try. I gotta say they have improved a lot since my last visit. I can say that they have the next closest poke to what Hawaii had to offer"}
{"text":"Heard plenty of good things about this place and wanted to try it out for a really long time. Finally got to try this place out over the long weekend. I ordered the Molakai bowl and some musubi's.   I first thought this bowl came with salmon and ahi tuna mix but apparently you can only get 1 choice of the two kinds of fish. On their menu it was a bit misleading as it says Salmon/Ahi tuna, so I didn't know you are only allowed to choose one or the other. All the other ingredients that came in this bowl were all pretty tasty. Personally, I don't really like so much seaweed salad and they gave a lot of it, I guess next time I can request them to not put any in my bowl... They are pretty generous in the cuts of fish they give in the bowls.   Pretty big chunks of fish, however there was a bit of a fishy smell so it that kind of gave me the indication that the fish is not all quite fresh... I did order poke on a scorching hot Saturday afternoon and it was very warm inside their store as well... but I don't know if that is any reason for the fish to smell a little and bits of the fish was turning brown.  The musubi's were also very bland and not very tasty. Couple of bites you only taste a a bit of satlyness from the slab of spam and the rice was very plain, considering its suppose to be made with sushi rice and I can tell that they did not put enough vinegar to make the rice to give it a bit of sweetness.   The staff working there that day were not as friendly and welcoming upon my visit. As I mentioned it was very warm inside their store so maybe the AC had blown out and it was too hot?, so they were more grumpy?  Who knows..   Pretty disappointed in the hype of this place, the taste and quality of their bowls weren't what I expected. Only take away is that their toppings are not bad but that's just about it."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out but never got around to it. Yesterday, I was walking around Kensington with my boyfriend and decided to try it out.   We got the Shack Special regular size - my boyfriend ordered and we got the poke bowl fairly quick as it wasn't busy. The ingredients looked fresh but taste was average. There was nothing that stood out that made me want to come back and try the other poke bowls. The rice was bland and was nothing but extra carbs. I noticed on the menu that you can opt for white rice, brown rice or salad - but when we ordered we never were asked what we wanted and automatically got white rice (This was our first time visiting North Poke). It was quite disappointing the person at the cash didn't even bother asking, they mostly talked among themselves and it didn't feel very welcoming.   As for seating, it's just standing by the window which is fine but would be nice if there were a couple of tables.   Overall, I would not recommend this place as there are many other poke places to check out instead which I am sure will offer the same or even better quality with good service."}
{"text":"Came here with friends last week and our taste buds and bellies were so happy. We shared three snack size bowls of the Waimea, Hawaii Classic, and The Big Wave for $15 total. The raw fish mixes came with either rice or greens and a taro chip. Each bowl was better than the next... I couldn't decide which was best. The flavours were amazing.  The interior is super cute but there is no seating, so we just ate standing up at the counters. The staff is also really friendly.  So glad poke has finally made its way over to Toronto. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"First time trying Hawaiian food.. I had heard good things about the famous Poke bowls. This tiny and cute place has a special thing compared to other Poke places, their differential is how they prepare their fish. It's marinated for few hours (while some other places just prepare at the moment you order), and it's the point where the fish get more flavoured. If you are vegan, that's fine too, they have a special one for you!   The regular size seems to be small, but definitely it's not. I couldn't finish mine. The bowls come with your choice of fish, rice (or salad), sewed salad, avocado, sweet onions and shallot chips.  They have lot of options of fish and also octopus (the only cooked option). From the ones I tried, all amazing! People there are really kind and if it's your first time don't worry because they will kindly make you feel the expert in pokes, hahaha."}
{"text":"I've tried Molokai and Hawaiian salad bowls here. They were very flavourful with a nice variety of veggies and generous amounts of sashimi. However ofcourse, they are expensive."}
{"text":"This was one of the only Poke places opened on Family Day, and I am so thankful for that. Ordered the 3 snack sizes for $15 and one original spam musubi. You are able to choose any of the bowls to be included in the 3 snack size special, I chose Hawaii Classic, Waimea, and Shack Special. I really recommend the Shack Special!! Honestly, 3 snack sizes for $15 is a steal compared to other Poke places in downtown. It gives you the opportunity to try different bowls at a reasonable price. You would think the snack sizes are small but if you share 3 with a friend, it's definitely enough to share and still feel satisfied. Also, the staff here were friendly and service was great. There are also some seating area in the restaurant to allow you to sit and eat. Only one complaint was the original spam musubi tasted somewhat bland and would be better if there was slightly more marinade. Would come back to this Poke place if I'm ever in the Kensington Market area."}
{"text":"We were visiting from the UK and asked some friends what the hot food trends were back in the States, and we were told - poke bowls!  Apparently they're also hot in Canada too.  We came in during a downpour and pulled up some stools at the window (that's all the seating there is) to people-watch and munch some fresh fish goodness.  The great thing about North Poke is you don't have to pick one bowl - you can get a mix of two.  So rather than having to pass bowls back and forth, we each got a half-and-half bowl.  I'll be honest with you, I do not even remember what we got.  I am looking at the menu, and I cannot remember.  What I do remember is that the salmon and tuna were impossibly fresh, the vegetables were crisp and bright, the sauces were bold, and everything blended just perfectly together.  There were no bad bites in these bowls.  Despite the weather being cold and rainy, we devoured these cool and refreshing meals.  They're surprisingly filling for such a seemingly light and healthy dish.  Whatever the medium or \"regular\" size was, that was enough for each of us - I couldn't even finish mine, actually.  The prices seemed high initially, but the quality of ingredients was so superb, the flavors so excellent, and the portions so satisfying that I no longer cared after a few minutes.  Wish we had a poke place near us, because this stuff is irresistible!"}
{"text":"They feature a variety of poke bowls. Personal favorite was the classic and albacore tuna. They spend a long time marinating the fish so you can really taste the flavours. The rice was well done as well. The storefront is a bit ambigous, at first it was hard to recognize the white font on a light blue fish logo sign, but luckily the entire store front was all glass, so you can see through to the inside and recognize the hawaiian decor. Would go again!"}
{"text":"So delicious and so fresh! I love that there are 3 different bowl sizes to choose from, especially the small snack size it's perfect for a quick pick me up. The food has been super fresh every time I've gone. On each bowl they always put a couple of taro chips on top and they're always such a good little treat! I love North Poke!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! All of the ingredients were fresh and delicious. I tried their poké bowls and they were incredible! The portions are great for the price and even the \"snack\" size is substantial enough for a meal.   The staff was super friendly and helpful. The service was super fast. Between when I placed an order and when I got my food was less than 10 minutes. Dining area is small, only some barstools by the window.   Great grab and go meal but I probably would not sit and eat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent taste and quality poké! The price is also not bad. This place gets busy and as most places in Kensington Market, there are not a lot of seating area. But that's ok especially if the weather is warm enough yo walk around. The containers they use are very portable for a person on the go. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Great spot off Kensington market for a poke bowl. I enjoyed the mix of flavor and fast service. Not much room to eat in though."}
{"text":"Love this place def recommend but at the same time it's a little bit more expensive than other poke places I've been too. Portions aren't big. But the poke is well seasoned. Recommend Waimea and also the big wave. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Poke in Toronto. Located in Kensington Market; the area is rich with trendy menus all around. Ordered the Classic. Well presented, fresh, and tasteful. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"NaPali is a must try. Came down there this week to check out the new menu they advertised on Facebook. Was worth the trip. Fresh scallop on rice was delicious. Will drop by again next time I go down to Eaton's."}
{"text":"FINALLY A GOOD POKÉ  SPOT IN TORONTO!  Came in on opening day and ordered the Hawaii classic.  The tuna was fresh, flavourful, and PLENTIFUL.  Ratios on ~fleek~ in my poké bowl, so zero complaints here.  Being the first day open they were still finding their rhythm, but the service was still efficient and the poké was delicious.  What more can you ask for?  I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I definitely have had poke bowls from other places that I enjoyed more. I didn't find that they had a lot of variety, but for what they had, the food was fresh and good. The scallops were really fresh and included jackfruit in the ingredients, which was unique and quite tasty. The salmon and tuna were really fresh! I found it pricey for the size of what we got."}
{"text":"My favorite poke place in the city! The fish is always fresh and it's the perfect balance with the other ingredients. I always get the Waimea and it's never disappointed me. The regular size doesn't look big but they pack a lot of food in there and it's definitely filling. The spam musubi is also good. Definitely worth a visit if you are near the area!"}
{"text":"** Savings Alert: Check-in on Yelp and save 10% off one regular or large poke bowl**   I saw North Poke on the Yelp page and I was like why not, let's be adventureous and try something new for lunch! After reading through some reviews, I was very excited to try their poke bowls.   Order: snack special - 3 snacks-sized pokes for $15. I eat a lot for a small guy but, I always end up asking myself, why am I still hungry? Trust me, 2 snack-sized pokes with rice is more than enough. If you do 2 pokes - 1 rice/1 salad, you will be just right!   Ono: octopus, potato, roasted red peppers, chorizo oil, lemon aioli, caper infused breadcrumbs Shack Special: salmon, gochuchang marinade, kimchi mayo, scallions, radish, friend shallot Molokai: Salmon/ahi tuna, sweet soy marinade, sambal crema, jalepeno, pickled shallots, nori, watermelon radish, green onions  Overall, I felt that the ingredients were fresh, but the poke bowls I ordered were average. I did however, enjoy their taro chips - they were crunchy/delicious and the octopus (flavourful)! In my opinion, it's 70% rice and 30% ingredients. I think I would've been ok with this ratio if the rice wasn't bland and if there was a bit more sauce. Customer service was ok - cashier didn't seem too pleased to be there. It was nice of her to ask if I wanted to substitute the rice for a salad, which I did, but didn't ask for which poke I wanted the salad in.    Other helpful tips (I saw a sign saying they will start selling shaved ice starting March 13!)   - Location: 179 Baldwin Street (In Kensington market right across from Blackbird Baking Co.)  - Specials: Try 3 snack-sized pokes for $15 - Utensils: If you aren't good with chopsticks, they have forks and spoons  - Take-out: Not much seating, better as a take-out option  - Seating: 7 red-stool type chairs  - Healthy Options: can opt for salad instead of rice/gluten-free options - Methods of Payment: Cash, credit card, Interac"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 diff flavours to try. I mean it was good but they all pretty much taste the same and look the same to me."}
{"text":"Came here as part of TO's Finest food crawl! Found this  on their app that tells you where to find food. So happy thus place was part of the food crawl! It was so easy to redeem.  Place smells so good too"}
{"text":"I had a quick lunch. I had poke bowls in the past. But this location was by far the best. Hands down.  Ordered the seared salmon. Amaaaazing!  Fish was cooked, should I say, seared to perfection. It had a lot of yummy vegetables.  I feel it was a very balance healthy meal."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have tried this place! The poke bowls we ordered were packed with amazingly fresh fish and ingredients. They definitely gave you your money's worth of food. I ordered the snack size waimea bowl with marinated salmon. It came with this pickled onion which was a pleasant surprise along with loads of fish. Although they missed one of our orders of musubi, their service was excellent. They located the order right away and made us two instead of just one!   I highly recommend this poke location as their service and staff are superb and food is on point. Most notably, they have 3 sizes of poke bowls which I really appreciate because I can never finish the regular size. The snack size is $5.95, regular is $10.95, and large is $14.95."}
{"text":"The poke was excellent and fresh.  I went to the pusateri's pop up stand, which is extremely convenient.  I wish they offered zucchini noodles like the Poke Box; however, I think the seaweed salad was a nice touch and offering the snack size is so ingenious."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with poke and I gotta say it did not disappoint. It was fresh and well seasoned and definitely worth the price. I got the 3 mini sampler and it was almost too much to finish. I'll definitely be back to try more of these awesome flavours."}
{"text":"Oh man! This was so good! I ordered the Hawaii Classic and was feeling rather hungry so had the large size. I definitely couldn't finish it all (and that never happens!). An amazing blend of fresh flavours and beautifully presented.  The staff are friendly and it all just makes for a very happy experience. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Poke is quickly becoming epidemic around Toronto, and the hype is real!  I've been on the poke train for quite some time, and sooo happy it's finally here. Now I'm not quite complaining, but do want to highlight that so many other resto's tend to jam it with tons of toppings. North Poke keeps it simple, and does it true justice.  With it's rock solid consistency, simple and fresh ingredients, and the fact they have spam masubi, this place is an awesome go-to when you're craving poke.  Shack special is fantastic, and the taro chips are a great addition. If you want to try them all, get the snack pak. Beware though, the bowls are deceivingly filling!"}
{"text":"This is probably my 4th time coming here within the last 2 months.  It's definitely one of my go-to place for Poke lunch.   It's conveniently located on the lower level of The Bay inside Sak's Foodhall.  There are some tables and stool tables but it will be hard to find a spot at lunch hour.  There are 3 sizes and I usually get the large size which is about $16.  It's a bit pricey so I can't have it too often.  I should try their regular size for $12 to see if it's filling enough.   I must say the large size is perfect because you get 2 large scoops of 2 different fish.   My favourite is the Big Wave which is Albacore Tuna mixed with jalepeno, citrus marinade with black garlic mayo.  The tuna is really sweet and tasty!  My second choice of fish will vary between the Hawaii Classic(Ahi Tuna), Waimea (Salmon), or the Scallop.  The most recent order that I had was the Big Wave & Scallop mix.  I think these two will likely be my regular choices.  You can choose either rice or salad as your base but I usually ask for half and half - rice and salad otherwise it's too much rice.  They also add the avocado, seaweed salad and taro chips which are so good in the Poke bowl.  Yummy!  Must come try one if you love Poke!"}
{"text":"2.5 round up to 3.   My review is based on the two recent visits to the Pusateri Food Hall location.   First visit was after 5pm so the choices were limited. I order a snack size Hawaii Classic (Ahi Tuna) bowl. The tuna was overly sauced and too salty to me. The taro chip was pretty stale and not fresh.  The staff pressed hard to put a cover on the bowl and the chip still looked a piece, so how \"soft\" you can tell the chip was.   Second visit, since I had my lunch already but I craved for Poke badly, so I went there to grab a snack size bowl. I wish I reviewed what I ordered before and didn't make the same mistake. The tuna tasted better this time, but the taro chip was still stale and chewy.   My complain this time is the service.   1- the lady who took my order didn't give me a number. It was messy and also don't know how to pick up my food.   2- inconsistent portion: 4 customers all ordered the Hawaii Classic snack size bowl. 2 bowls got 2 slices of avocado, mine got 1 slice and the last one got 3 slices (obviously he gave away my portion to the last bowl)   When there are so many choices of good poke place downtown, would I come back again? Maybe Not."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5 Located in the Kensington Market on Baldwin St and Kensington Ave.   [SERVICE] - 5/5 Staff are very cool, friendly, and personable. They helped me choose a poke bowl based on my preferences (something with salmon, also fresh, and light).  [DÉCOR] - 4/5  Small shop with topical, Hawaiian vibes. There were lots of fun posters with pineapples on them! Seating was limited, best for takeout during peak hours.   [FOOD QUALITY] - 4/5 This place uses high-quality fish and fresh toppings. However, I think the portions were quite small for the prices.   [ORDER] - 4/5 Shack Special (Snack Size) - $5.95: includes salmon, gochuchang, kimchi mayo, scallions, fried shallots, and radish on rice. All bowls come with seaweed salad, taro, avocado, and pickled onions. Ingredients were fresh, added many wonderful textures and flavours to the bowl. Raw salmon was fresh. Rice was the perfect combination of soft and sticky.   [OVERALL] - 4/5 A little overpriced for the portion size, but the poke bowl was a wonderful medley of high-quality ingredients. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"finally had the time to visit this spot. love the decor - simple and very Hawaiian.  i got the spam musubi cuz i love spam, seaweed and rice but combining all 3 in this side is a disappointment. it's premade so the seaweed and spam are both soggy which gave it a very fishy taste.  i got the regular Hawaii classic and although there was nothing bad with the poke bowl, the flavours didn't do it for mem for example, the flavouring of the ahi tuna was salty and there was nothing in the bowl that offset that strong flavour, even with the brown rice. i liked the taro chips, buttery and crispy. i also liked that they had put jalapenos in when i asked for it to be spicy instead of using hot sauce like siracha. mine came with seaweed cuz i checked in on Yelp"}
{"text":"By checking in on Yelp, I received extra seaweed salad - great! I tried the Hawaii Classic bowl. The mix didn't taste fresh and the tuna was too tough. I LOVED the taro chips though! Those were so good, I'd rather get a bowl of those chips instead. The seaweed was also yummy.  I imagined the regular to be a lot more filling than it looked, but it wasn't. It had me satisfied but not completely full.  Overall, I prefer Poke Guys over this store. The ingredients taste fresher there and the portions are bigger so it's better value."}
{"text":"I usually get the Molokai tuna and salmon on rice.  The regular is a great size for lunch or dinner.  I love coming here- all the employees are really nice :)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Poke for the longest time and I thought North Poke would be the best place to set my standards. I ordered their regular sized Molokai Poke with rice, and salmon+tuna (totaling to a little over $12). For the price I was initially a little disappointed by the size of the bowl--it looked small...but by the end of the meal I was STUFFED.  As a complete newbie to poke, I was eating each ingredient individually at first. The I realized I should probably mix everything up. That was a very good idea because the ingredients all meshed so well together and I loved the pickled shallots and onions so much; it really brought a refreshing punch to the creamy sauce the fish were coated in.  My one negative is that I found some bites of the sashimi were a little tough. I'm thinking it was from the tuna so I will probably get just salmon next time.   Overall I was very satisfied. I'll definitely be coming back to try the other poke bowls!"}
{"text":"Of all the poke places I've been to in Toronto, I would say this is one of the best ones.  Hawaii Classic Poke & Wai Mea Poke ($9.95 each for regular size) The Hawaii Classic was ahi tuna mixed in shoyu dressing, and the Wai Mea was salmon mixed in togarashi aioli dressing topped on rice. Both bowls comes with seaweed salad, avocado, and taro chips on the side - all fresh ingredients. Regular was the right size - decent amount of protein and not overwhelmed with rice. I like how the rice had bits of seaweed mixed in so it wasn't just plain rice. I personally thought the Hawaii Classic had a more distinct flavor. The Wai Mea seemed to be more of a mayo mixed kind of dressing, it looks saucey and creamy but flavor wise it was light. Tasted really refreshing!  Spam Musubi ($1.50) Tried the teriyaki spam sushi. The size of the spam was decent, but way too much rice. I've had teriyaki spam before and it tasted way more flavorful than this. To me, it seemed like it was just original spam put a little teriyaki sauce added to it. Tasty but nothing special, just spam and rice."}
{"text":"Got the snack size of the Big Wave poke bowl which has albacore tuna, jalapeño citrus dressing, black garlic mayo, and tenkasu (crunchy bits of deep fried batter). Everything about this was fresh and flavorful. It's also very refreshing and feels healthy despite the mayo and bits of fried batter.   The taro chips tasted just as fresh and were a perfect salty and crunchy complement to the soft clean-tasting tuna. The snack size is exactly that and the one pictured doesn't even show that the bowl, which can fit in your palm, has some greens on the bottom so it isn't jam packed filled with tuna. I'd come back here, but for around $7, it won't be often. Too bad we can't get these as easily as we get the Facebook type of pokes.  Rating: 4 drama-filled unfriendings out of 5"}
{"text":"Admittedly, when the the poke and sushi burrito craze hit Toronto, I was part of the crowd that believed these two things were just overpriced versions of sushi---why get a poke bowl when I could grab chirashi or hoedapbap; why sushi burrito when I could get a dragon roll combo? Even after begrudgingly trying a couple of sushi burrito and poke spots that were popping around the neighbourhood I still had my reservations. Slowly I began to recognize that they were sufficiently distinct from the sushi culture and despite eating similar or even the ingredients, the format allows for varying levels of different ingredients in each bite as well as a larger combination of unique/unexpected ingredients, making it fun and engaging in a way.  I tried North Poke when I was on lunch break and unable to locate a sushi joint within walking distance. While I can't speak for authenticity, North Poke's offerings stand apart from its peers in the following ways: their fish is very fresh; the marinades and sauces used don't overwhelm the fish but instead highlight their freshness; the former two points are further reinforced by their choice in composition of other ingredients, which also happen to set it quite distinctly apart from those of the sushi genre. Also, I'm a huge sucker for spam musubi. Their Shack special and Spicy Molokai are my favourite and they are going to be a part of my weekly Ritual when the craving hits. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"By far the best poke bowl I've tasted in Toronto (and I've been to quite a few); however, a star is deducted for inconsistent portions. I ordered the snack size twice, the first time it was filled to the brim and the second time it was only half full."}
{"text":"Best Poke in Toronto thus far. I think they are understaffed though as the process from order to payment is a bit all over the map."}
{"text":"This is likely one of my favourite poke locations in Toronto for many reasons! - location (who does not love Chinatown and Kensington market) - size options (you can try 3 poke for $15!) - fresh fish options (from salmon to tuna to octopus, happy days!) - gluten free option (everything for all ) - friendly - commitment to putting SPAM on the table in Toronto (Musubi, I had a burnt one but appreciate the effort ) - price, fairly reasonable in comparison to all other Poke restaurants out there   I have tried a number of the poke bowls but not a vegetarian (tofu) option yet; I have not mustered the courage but maybe on my next visit   Also, it seems Yelp'ers can get a 10% deal for check-in (my bad, I was in a rush to go back to work and didn't check-in, #YelpFAIL) . Hopefully others will find this review helpful and take advantage of it!"}
{"text":"Loving that I can get North Poke so close to work!  They have a great spot close to the cash and exit for quick pick up!  I picked up a snack bowl and the quality was there, no compromise!  Prices were the same, staff was energetic and no complaints (except they didn't do 3 for $15 snack bowls).  $5.95 snack bowl. $11.95 for large.  It was delicious and I am super happy that I can enjoy North Poke for lunch"}
{"text":"I ordered the Waimea poke bowl in regular size. For a regular sized bowl, I found it a bit too small for the price they sold it for so it kind of disappointed me a bit. The other options in sizes were also small as the snack sized bowl was I would say relative to the size of my hand. The bowl itself was not extraordinary but I did want to try this place for some time already and now that I did, I do not think I will return."}
{"text":"This place will transport you to the islands with their awesome poké, shaved ice, and Spam musubi."}
{"text":"I'll go straight to the point, it is by far the best poke I've had, and I've had some already. It doesn't even taste the same.  The fish is really tasty thanks to the marinade, and there are many different ones, unlike some places where they just add the sauce when they make the bowl, and it changes everything. The pieces are not too big not too small so you can really taste the fish.Also they are very generous with said fish so that's a big plus. I am also amazed by the seaweed salad that taste a little sweet and super tasty. Also as a sidenots, avocado seems often included in the bowls, unlike many places that charges you extra fee for it, so good point.  I now want to go and try every different kind they have."}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke spot in the city - the only place I will come to for poke. The portions are generous and prices are completely reasonable. They also don't skimp out on the protein and generous with the toppings. Love love love North Poke. So good."}
{"text":"Located in Pusateri Food Hall which is really conveniently if you want to stay in the PATH especially during the winter.  Thanks for the Yelp App check in for bonus seaweed!   Love my Ahi Tuna bowl! There was so much tuna and they were fresh and well seasoned! Sadly the sushi rice was NOT good. Hard and dry!    Maybe just pick another carbs? But I love my sushi rice. Hopefully they would improve on that and this will be a perfect bowl of Poke!"}
{"text":"Was really disappointed in North Poke after coming here for a quick bite.  Ordered a snack-sized Waimea with rice and there was nothing special about it. The rice was burning hot which was strange considering every other poke place I've been too, the rice is warm because they usually use seasoned sushi rice. I'm sure it cooked half of the salmon which is kind of gross. The flavor was disappointing too, not enough seasoning.   Got two other spam musubis which, although it wasn't bad, nothing was great about it. The rice fell apart instantly and you really can't go wrong with spam meat lol.   It is a bit more expensive than other places too since the containers are smaller"}
{"text":"North Poke is a Hawaiian-style poke restaurant located in Kensington Market. Hawaiian poke is a little different compared to California-style bowls, as they're marinated for a few hours prior to being served. Until June 30th, they also have a pop-up shop with Pusateri's at the Sak's foodhall inside the Eaton Center, and this was where I visited them.   Unlike other poke places in the city, you can't customize your box at North Poke. However, they do have about 7 different poke bowls available - all with different flavour profiles. I opted for the Waimea, which came with salmon, togarashi mayo, tobiko, sesame, green onions, red onions, fried shallots, and edamame. The salmon was fresh, well-marinated and I really liked the spiciness of the sauce. It had a nice kick and not bland. For decorative purposes, it came with some crispy taro chips, which I also enjoyed. I thought that the regular size ($10.95) wouldn't be filling enough, but I was wrong. They were pretty generous with their portions (including the amount of salmon)."}
{"text":"Aloha! Poke fans rejoice!   North Poke ranks first on my list of poke restaurants in Toronto. Everything is made fresh. The owners pride themselves in receiving a fresh shipment of seafood daily.   I've had the pleasure of visiting North Poke a few months ago for a Yelp elite event and have been longing to revisit ever since! .   The snack size ($5.95) is the perfect size for a meal for me. It is filling without feeling like I am over indulging. I am a fan of most of the offerings at North Poke. They are all winners in my opinion! My favorites are the Waimea (salmon, togarashi mayo, tobiko, sesame, green onions, red onions, fried shallots, edamame) and the slightly unconventional Ono (octopus, potato, roasted red peppers, chorizo oil, lemon aioli, caper infused breadcrumbs)!  I adore Waimea for its composition, the juxtaposition of cream togarashi mayo with crispy shallots and sharp green onions. I love the unique composition of Ono, with lemon aioli to cut through the smokey chorizo oil!   Each bowl is topped with pickled onions, Wakame salad and taro chips with your choice of rice or salad! I was delighted to learn that North Poke has recently started offering brown rice as a option to accompany your choice of protein!   Aloha k?kou! Till we meet again! :)"}
{"text":"Nice little póke spot. It's a small location, but they offer póke and a separate counter for flavored shaved ices, which we did not try.  I had the Hawaiian Classic as a salad with added jalapeños. The jalapeños added a nice extra kick of heat. The salad mix they used was not my favorite. Some of the bites tasted dirty. The tuna was solid. Very flavorful. I loved the taro chip topper and fresh avocado.  I also had the seaweed salad and that was super duper fresh and delicious.   Lots of folks were getting orders to go/delivery. Seems to be a popular place."}
{"text":"North Poke is a small poke place in between Kensington market and Chinatown Toronto. There's only room for at most 10 people, so I would advise to just take your poke to a nearby park or food court since it's pretty uncomfortable to eat in.  I ordered a large Waimea bowl with half brown rice and half salad.   What I liked: The poke was very fresh and the serving size for a large was very generous (approx 3 scoops). I got what I paid for (~$16) They put some unique ingredients like taro chips, fried onion  What I didn't like I asked for my sauce to be on the side - they still gave me poke drenched in spicy mayo. I tried washing off the mayo but my lactose sensitive stomach still felt sick after eating it.   The brown rice was severely dry and undercooked. I felt like I was nibbling on flavourless pieces of plastic.   The rice was also drenched in seaweed salad dressing... half the bowl ended up tasting like the seaweed salad :( I wanted to taste the avocado/onion/furikake umaminess but sadly missed out.  The fried onion + white onion + green onion combo made it overwhelmingly oniony and it just tasted really awkward with the raw fish and other ingredients.  I would ask to separate the raw onions next time, if there is a next time.  Other than the freshness of the fish, I would not come back to North Poke. The flavours just didn't sit well with me, and I've had a lot better poke elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying poke bowl here and it was delicious! I've had poke bowl before at Poke Guys and comparatively this place is slightly more expensive ($11 for regular) and less food. But the food is definitely a lot more savoury.   I had the octopus bowl and it was delicious! Only thing is this place doesn't have a lot of seating so a lot of people just do take outs."}
{"text":"Gave North Poke a second time and it was worth it!!! Didn't have rice at all. So no update there. The food was great and fresh. People who have weak teeth might want to steer clear from options with lots of taro chips though."}
{"text":"What to try?  Their poke bowls of course!! We tried their Molokai poke bowl and we loved it! I liked how I was given the choice of salmon or tuna or a mix of both! Of course I picked a mix of both. You get the best of both worlds, why not?! The Molokai bowl has salmon/ahi tuna, sweet soy marinade, sambal crema, jalepeno, pickled shallots, nori, watermelon radish, and green onions. Yummmmmy!   The service was pretty quick because we went a good time just after 1 pm. It's also because they had the different mixture for the poke bowl ready to go already. They essentially need to add the ingredients together to make your poke bowl. The bowls come in three different sizes so you can choose a size that fits for you or your party.   Last tip?  If you check in on yelp, you get an extra 2 oz of seaweed salad added to your poke bowls. Feels great when the bowl is already delicious that you get an extra dose of seaweed salad!!"}
{"text":"I've been back a couple of more times. Happy to see they now sell Poke by weight and a new bowl with half ahi/salmon. My favorite is still the Hawaii Classic. This is still my favorite poke place in Toronto. Thanks Linda for the fresh bowl to make up for our first visit. That's what I call awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying: I LOVE POKE BOWLS.  So so so so so so so good.  Accidentally came across this place as I was exiting the parking garage in Kensington Market.  Of course I had to try it.  There's limited seating (it's not really a sit down type of place).  It was a cute little shop.  The menu isn't too large, but there were good options.  Each item had a description of what was in it, which was helpful.  I'm not a picky eater, so really I could've closed my eyes and chose one and I'm sure I'd love it.  I got the Regular sized bowl, which was suuuuper filling.  The employees were friendly and helpful which was a big plus.  The food itself was outstanding.  And if you check in while you're there, they provide you with a little coupon!  I'd definitely recommend.  I would even make the trip downtown just to get a poke bowl from here!"}
{"text":"YELP TIP: Check-in and you get a free extra 2oz seaweed salad added !   Came for a quick late dinner take-out and really enjoyed their Shack Special that consisted of salmon sashimi, fried shallots, and delicious kimchi sauce on salad. Each of their poke bowls had a no additional fee toppings of seaweed salad, avocado, taro chips, and pickled onions. The regular bowl size was filling enough for a meal but they also have a large bowl option.   Overall $10.99 for a bowl was OK. The toppings were pretty generous and everything tasted fresh, but you didn't have much flexibility on adding what you wanted and there were no fruit options. I did find a piece of sticker in my bowl so I was put off a bit.."}
{"text":"Got the $15 for 3 snack size bowl. staff were nice and all but found a dead bug in my Hanalei bowl..."}
{"text":"North Poke is the latest addition to the Poke craze growing in Toronto. I had the opportunity last night to check out NorthPoke's soft opening to try a few of their popular Poke Bowls. Located in the heart of Kensington Market (173 Baldwin St), this Hawaiian/beach house themed Poke spot offers a variety of poke bowls featuring ahi tuna, albacore, salmon and octopus, to satisfy your poke cravings. What's unique about North Poke is their focus on keeping things simple and true to the flavours. Oftentimes, other Poke places pile on a whole bunch of toppings in your bowl, which masks the actual flavours so the fish and marinate used. If you're in the area, be sure to drop by to try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I recently did a couple of events with North Poke and after getting to sample their deliciousness two nights not too long ago, I was craving it again hard. I've since been back two more times as a paying customer.   I am all about their Hawaii Classic, tuna sharply marinated in perfection, hold the onions. Their middle size is all you need for a very filling meal, but if you're starving there's a massive size, too. This summer they're going to start serving shaved ice, and I look forward to popping for a cool down once the weather warms up. Aloha!"}
{"text":"This poke bowl place in Kensington had great reviews so I stopped by. This is my first poke place. I really wanted to like it but wasn't for my palette. I tried the 3 snack sizes. The fish was marinated so felt a little ceviched. Slightly cooked from the marinade and fishy. Fresh fish should not be fishy. I think I prefer the California style. Cool concept tho"}
{"text":"Great small shop in Kensington Market selling fresh made poke! Out of all the poke shops I've tried in Toronto, I have to say that North Poke is definitely one of the better places to get you poke fix. The shop only has limited seating (around 8 seats), so it may be more difficult to find a seat during busier times.   I dropped by on a Wednesday evening and got a snack size Molokai bowl (salmon) with salad. The snack size was a perfect portion as I wanted to get a light bite to eat. The fish was fresh and sweet soy marinade did not overpower all the other ingredients in the bowl. Overall, the flavours worked well together and I would definitely like to try the other bowls in the future!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to sample some of the menu items on the newly opened North Poke in Kensington Market.  I tried about 4 different kinds but I didn't have a chance to try the Musubi, the Nori wrapped spam sushi.  Maybe next time.  The flavours are very fresh and interesting.  My favourite was the Big Wave,  with Albacore Tuna, Jalapeno citrus dressing and black garlic and may dressing.  Try the Hawaiian Classic with Ahi Tuna and classic toppings.."}
{"text":"North Poke serves the most authentic Hawaiian poke bowls in Toronto! Unlike other poke joints in this city (that usually double as sushi burrito joints), this place prepares their poke through hours of marinating and using fresh fish daily. This quality shines through in the flavour of their food!   All of their signature bowls come with taro chips, seaweed salad and avocado. They now offer you a choice between white rice or brown rice as well. The small sized option is great for a quick snack, and the regular sized option is filling enough for the average person. This place does not skimp on their fish portions either =)   Aside from poke bowls, they also serve Hawaiian shaved ice and spam musubi (spam sushi?) here. I have not tried either of these two yet, but their inclusion in the menu further solidifies this place as an authentic Hawaiian joint =)"}
{"text":"My fave poke spot in the city! It's the closest you'll get to authentic Hawaiian poke. None of that build your own bowl stuff like most joints in the city. The spicy salmon is my personal favourite! Food is always fresh and service is friendly!"}
