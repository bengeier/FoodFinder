Bon service et excellentes entrées et le menu dégustation un must!"}
{"text":"Fresh Indian cuisine served up fast in Rosemont. Who knew? It's a pleasure to be served food, whipped up in front of you by a cook who obviously loves cooking. 
I asked for \"a little spicy\" and it was at my hot limit and delicious; so be prudent when declaring your spice tolerance. 
I found this place by chance and I'll definitely be back. - bring your own wine!"}
{"text":"I really like my dinner at tandoori Masson. The place is not too big so there's not too much noise. The service was perfect. The lady who serve us explain everything to us because we didn't know anything about Indian food. She was really nice and helpful. The food was excellent and I think it's really a good place to taste Indian food for the first time. It's now been at least 7 times i go there and everytimes i'm happy with my experience."}
