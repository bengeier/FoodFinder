{"text":"Kudos to Hodge Podge for creating an American version of \"Poutine\" during their Denver stop of the Great Food Truck Race.  It started with a layer of perfectly crispy tater tots (can you teach me how to make them so yummy?), followed by a HUGE mound of braised short rib, perfectly tender and juicy, topped with baby spinach(??), and, to make it \"poutine-like\" drizzled with a cheddar cheese gravy.  I must say, it was DIVINE!  A little hard to eat out of a small dish, but so yummy!!    Then, I watered it down with a raspberry-basil lemonade!  A subtle flavor of basil that was perfect in the 80-degree weather.  I would say, though, that the limade was too tart for my tastes - I had to reach for the sweetener just to get through the glass.  After tasting the other trucks creations (which were definitely contenders), I left saying the Hodge Podge truck had stolen my heart!  I was a bit appalled by the $12 price tag, but you definitely gave me the best bang for the buck versus the other trucks!  Good luck on the rest of your race!  You have some fierce competitors, but I am a sucker for \"comfort food.\""}
{"text":"We went downtown and found the Hodge Podge truck and tried the pierogies with an aioli sauce and arugula salad  and sweet potato tots!  I have never been sooo shocked! Everything, and i mean Everything was incredibly good!  The sauce on the pierogies is exactly what pierogies need to make them pop!  The dressing on the salad was sooo yummy!  And the tots were unexpected but Great!  We all loved the food and if we can find the truck again we will stop! I want my husband to try the pierogies but i dont think they make the same food every day.  I need to find out if they have a menu i can check online.   So bottom line, my advice is - Eat At Hodge Podge!  You wont be disappointed.   P.S. Congrats Hodge Podge on the race, we were broken hearted you came in 2nd. But you represented Cleveland Proud!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see them at the ALIVE festival and couldn't wait to try them. They are from Ohio and I saw them on the food network. I wanted to splurge on the last day of the festival and enjoy their food. The wait was long but considering the size of the festival it was  no surprise. Looking at the limited menu at hand I decided to get the Shrimp and Lobster Roll it was the most expensive item on the menu. The description was made my mouth water Lobster and shrimp with romaine. When I received this item I was highly disappointed. It was seafood salad thrown on a hotdog bun with a sprig arugula. Nothing like the description . I may not be a food critic but I know the difference between arugula and roman. Also the Seafood really smelled I was scared to eat it so my husband ate it and he went to the Pizza vendor instead for me. This was a disappointment."}
{"text":"I had a good first experience with the Hodge Podge truck. After hunting it down in the CIA parking lot (that's the Cleveland Institute of Art... though this truck was covert enough to be CIA), I ordered an artichoke burger and got it made in less than 5 min!  This burger was so good. The flavors worked so well together, and I'm craving the juicyness of the burger right now. I think there were roasted red peppers, artichokes, goat cheese (mmm), cucumber, and mustard aioli, all on a perfectly toasted bun. MM, perfect combination.   I was definitely full after this burger. I felt that it was a little pricy though... $8 for a burger from a food truck seemed steep.  Come back to the university circle area!!!  PS - they are famous and they are on tv (great food truck race)"}
{"text":"Why must you disappoint me Hodge Podge? The fig burger sounded so tasty but it was bland. The poor meat was not seasoned at all. No salt, no pepper just nothing. The figs were tasty but really the lame piece of meat topping them was just sad. The goat cheese seemed more of an after thought like oh this burger must have cheese. And there were the tater tots. 7 is hardly an appropriate portion when charging 3 dollars. And on a hot summer day to have no bottled water available for purchase when you pull in is nothing short of a mortal sin. IT WAS WALNUT WEDNESDAY it's not like people were not going to buy it. UGH I won't be returning this Wednesday or any other. I would rather have Umamimoto any day."}
{"text":"My Cleveland food truck saga continues! These guys were actually at Crocker park on Saturday. I don't know if Crocker Park has an agreement worked out with the food trucks or the food trucks know it is a great scene but they are there almost every Saturday morning. What could be better than some shopping with awesome food?  Anyway I was really excited to see these guys here as they have a slightly different menu than I'm used to from most food trucks. Tater tots anyone? Yes please.   I believe I had some sort of pulled pork sandwich and it was amazing. One of the best pulled pork I have had in a long time. And that is sort of my favorite.   The food came out promptly and they accepted my credit cards. What more could you ask for?   Do yourself a favor and when you see this truck rolling around in the CLE make sure to stop by! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Thank you Hodge Podge for representing Cleveland so well in Food Network's Great Food Truck Race and making a fantastic crab cake sandwich.  You definitely have a repeat customer when your truck rolls around Downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"It was a warm, sunny day today so I hopped on the intarwebz to see if any food trucks were near my downtown office for lunch. I'll admit that Hodge Podge was probably my fourth choice on the list, but the first three were nowhere to be found, and I was lucky enough to find Hodge Podge settled in a parking spot just a block away. Lucky because they originally wanted to park about 10 streets farther but couldn't find a spot.  Skipping popular items like the PBLT, I wanted to try something new and different. Enter the Hodge Dog ($7). Reading the description, it sounded like their unique take on the polish boy: deep fried dog on a toasted bun, topped with tater tots, asian slaw, and sweet BBQ sauce. Wow. I had to try it.  It took less than 5 minutes to prepare (I managed to beat the lunch rush), and as soon as this sloppy beast was handed to me, some of the slaw sauce got on my finger. I licked it off and already fell in love. I darted to the nearest eating area and devoured this tasty mess. While the whole wasn't much greater than the sum of its parts, you can't go wrong with the parts themselves. What's not to love about a deep fried dog on a toasted bun? And asian slaw? and TOTS? Dude... tots. My only gripe was that the BBQ sauce lacked flavor.   So yeah, I'm a fan. While I'm still not completely sold on Cleveland's food truck scene (Jibaro had my insides en fuego, and Hodgson's other truck, Dim and Den Sum, was neither dim nor sum), Hodge Podge has restored my hope that the food truck scene is more than just a gimmick."}
{"text":"Visited the Cleveland-based truck in Miami during The Great Food Truck Race. Fish tacos with cabbage, jalapeno, peaches and lemon aioli was a nice take on the fish taco. Grilled rather than fried fish would have kept the dish healthier and lighter, but all around a sound effort and on par with many of the better food trucks in South Florida in terms of menu and prep. I think the slowish service was due to challenging menus during The Great Food Truck Race, but the output was def worth the wait."}
{"text":"Visited Hodge Podge on their Great Food truck race stop through Atlanta...the wait was very long, both to order and then the agonizing wait to pick up the food.  Truffle tots were a little disappointing at first- lacked flavor and tasted just like the frozen tots you buy from the supermarket.  But as they cooled, the truffle taste became stronger and tastier.  Fried chicken tacos were good- crispy and tender chicken and the spicy corn slaw was the best part.  The portions were small but colorful and attractive w/ purple cabbage.  Wish they had the \"Poutine\" that others raved about...as a former Canadian, I would have loved to try it.  May be better if they didn't have to deal with the massive crowds or if they refined their menu a bit.  (I also tried Roxy's and Lime Truck- I would say Hodge Podge was my least favorite of the 3.)"}
{"text":"An interesting thing happened to the food scene during the recession.   Upscale restaurant business took a hit. No longer did everyone have the means to splurge as often on white linen, fresh cut flowers and the ambiance that typically accompanies these fine restaurants. Simply put, foodies still desired good food and drink, but were through paying for the B.S. that went along with it.   In these last few years, foodies became the new rockers. Hip, socially aware, thrill seekers who strived for innovative eats in an alternative environment, yet wouldn't settle for lesser ingredients or sloppy execution. Thus, the advent of pop-up restaurants, underground dinner parties and mobile food trucks. Gone were the costly overheads that handcuffed most chefs. New to the scene were inspired eats without all the B.S.   Chris Hodgson's second truck in Cleveland has finally hit the streets after a yet to be aired TV series on the Food Network. And we're glad he's back home, doing what he's best at, right here in Cleveland. With his previous truck (Dim and Den Sum), he's basically single handily revolutionized the CLE food truck scene as we know it. And him and his crew seem to have it down to a science. I've never had a bad meal at this or his other truck. Most everything is cooked to order, sold at a modest price and ready to eat within a few short minutes following an order.   The last three times I've patronized Hodge Podge has been on Saturday morning at the Shaker Hts Farmers Market. One week it was bourbon souffle pancakes with balsamic macerated strawberries, house whipped cream and mint. The next, it was a breakfast sandwich with sausage, eggs, sweet potatoes and a ramp/garlic-scape pesto. And the week before that, it was an order of 3 breakfast tacos with all the fixings. The divinity and bliss that followed served as a kick-start to my weekend. For three consecutive weeks. I'm not sure what I'd do without this truck. In convenience alone, it's worth a look. But to have a lasting presence in the Cleveland food scene with loyal, repeat customers, you'll need to back it up with quality. And Hodge Podge certainly has that covered."}
{"text":"Cleveland food truck review #2: the season of (yuppie gourmet) meals on wheels at work continues--huzzah!  Upon being unshackled from my desk at midday, I scampered off to forage for some sustenance, preferably something new and tasty but not too heavy.  For an establishment that runs on the tagline, \"Comfort Food on Wheels,\" I knew I'd be hard pressed to find something truly light but I did my best, with what was left on the quickly diminishing options on the markerboard menu: sweet potato tater tots ($3) and gazpacho ($4).  The tater tots were served up hot, cinnamony sweet, crunchy, lightly coated with sea salt, and extremely filling.  One order could have fed three people of average appetites, no problem.  I importuned for a side of sauce and was given something that tasted like sirracha swirled in ketchup.  Not bad.    The gazpacho was similarly served up in a cup that could have easily fed three people as well.  Good grief.  I snagged one of their plastic teaspoons to stir up the refreshing, spicy, pulpy raw tomato puree ice-cold soup--reminiscent of a gourmet V8 and perfect for the summer--and promptly lost my utensil in the depths of spicy tomato smoothie.    I almost always finish my plate, thanks to a somewhat stern and food-revering upbringing, and I certainly haven't been so uncomfortably full from side dishes at a food truck before, but I guess there's always a first.  I'll most certainly back if I ever run into the Hodge Podge peeps again.  The burgers (100% Angus beef)--including something dubbed the \"Italian Stallion\" smelled ferociously tantalizing and sported fluffy, gorgeous, shiny buns, which reminded me of that Filipino bread, pan de sal.  I almost ordered the truffle mac (and cheese) but instead was forced to watch one of the truck attendants wipe it off the board, immediately after the three seconds it took me to read those words and finish marveling over what they meant: truffles?!!? mac and cheese! nom nom nom!     Didn't order any dranks but heard and saw tons of folks going for their apple soda--may have to snag one next time as well.  The workflow/service seemed a little uneven and the utensil/napkin setup a little haphazard.  Also, drinks were strangely stored in a cooler apart from the truck.  The twenty-minute wait could've been shortened, but until they work it out, I say the eats are good enough to endure the kinks for now."}
{"text":"We unfortunately do not see this truck very much anymore - probably because Chef Hodgson is pursuing other interests, what with his restaurant and Next Food Network Star and whatnot.  They are also pretty horrible at updating their social media outlets re: where they will be during the week.  However, when we do see this truck, we almost invariably need to check it out.  To find it, I would check the typical food truck gatherings - Walnut Wednesdays or Food Truck Fridays, for instance.  The truck is pretty awesome - it's as good as the restaurant is.  The Hodge Burger is packed with stuff, very juicy and delicious.  And the tater tots are crispy, flavored well - the best that you can find in Cleveland.  The PBLT is worth a try as well.  Oh, and the people on the truck are very nice - we stopped by once at around 2 pm as they were closing up and taking down their sign, but they stayed open for a few more minutes for us so we could have a taste of their wonderful burger."}
{"text":"We were fortunate enough to have these cats visit us in Denver on their way across the country.  I wanted to like Hodge Podge so much!  I love lobster rolls and truffle anything, so we were pumped up to see lobster rolls on the menu along with truffle mac and cheese and truffle tator tots.  The truffle tator tots were some of the most delicious tots I've had.  The mac and cheese was pretty dissapointing.  I expected more cheesiness and there was very little truffle flavor unfortunately.  You get a ton of lobster on the lobster roll and it's topped with a LOT of arugula which is then drizzled with truffle oil.  I appreciated the truffle oil, but there just wasn't enough mayo on the lobster for my tastes.  Overall, they have solid food and are cool cats, I was just more blown away by some of the other trucks. (the Hot Dog looked hella good though)"}
{"text":"Hodge Podge came to Vegas along with other food trucks for the Great Food Truck Race filmed by the Food Network.... Im pretty sure it was the great food truck race because their next competition is in Salt Lake City, UT. They were joined with Fuku Burger (Vegas), Sloppi Joes (Vegas), Sky Tacos (la), and Korilla Korean Bqq (NY). They were filming at the time and Fuku gave a shoutout so we decided to check it out. We tried all the trucks and we had the truffle mac n'c cheese and the chicken and waffles. As we were taking bites of all the foods from the trucks, we were kind of disappointed with them. We understood that during this challenge they weren't allowed to use propane, so the trucks were running with butane stoves... our mac n' cheese was cold, the cheese had a crumbly, grainy taste to it.... the meat on top was ok... kinda chewy.... the chicken and waffles were OK.... it wasnt actually a breakfast waffle, but more like a moist indian nan bread.... and the chicken was also cold, dry, and flavorless. Lastly, we bought their hibiscus sweet tea... ehhh it was gross....   There are so many better trucks in Vegas that should replace their spot in the food truck competition :("}
{"text":"We visited this truck here in Denver, CO as they rolled through.  It was the first truck we decided to check out.  We wanted to try their Lobster Roll and Truffle Mac-n-Cheese.  I have to say I was a bit underwhelmed.  Not that it wasn't good, it was good.  But it wasn't great.  I was expecting to be over the moon with the truffle mac-n-cheese (especially).  There just wasn't enough cheesy saucy goodness for a Mac-N-Cheese.  It was macaroni noodles al dente (perfectly cooked) with a little bit of melted cheesiness and a hint of truffle oil.  Just didn't seem like anything I couldn't probably make at home myself.  The lobster roll was the same thing.  They gave you hoards of lobster with not nearly enough sauce!  My hubby made this sandwich a few months ago from a famous chef recipe and it was better than this one.  So...needless to say I was a bit dissapointed.  However, when I bit into their truffle tator tots...Oh My Word.  Who knew that tator tots could taste SO FREAKING GOOD.  I think I had dreams about those tots later that night.  I could eat an entire plateful or two of these things.  I don't know how they do it...just wish someone else in Denver made these so I could satisfy my cravings.  Well done.  One final note...for the gentlemen...they did have a very lovely brunette taking orders :)."}
{"text":"Dear Hodge Podge,  Can you puh-lease relocate to the streets of Memphis Tennessee?  Immediately?  I was ever so fortunate to get my mouth around some of your fried avocado tacos during your Food Network Great Food Truck Race, and have not been the same since.  I don't know how you did it, nor do I care to know.  Just please keep serving me piping hot fried avocado tacos for breakfast, lunch and dinner ever single day. I dream about these freaking tacos. Crispy of the outside, creamy inside sandwiched between the best dressed jicama and lemon aiole sauce I've ever tasted. I hope the good folks of Cleveland realize how lucky they are to have such amazing food whizzing by in that truck of yours.  How much would a gal have to pay you to permanently set up in her driveway?  In the meantime, my poor husband is trying (and failing miserably) to recreate this dish in our kitchen here at home. Keep up the good work and I will definitely look ya'll up whenever I am in town!  Sincerely,  Erica B."}
{"text":"Hodge Podge Truck - Congrats for 2nd place - Your food looked good & the way the desserts flew was amazing ! Wish you could of won - hopefully i can get to Cleveland soon & look for you"}
{"text":"Wednesday which is when all the food trucks in Cleveland meet on one street right next to my workplace. I only got to go once, but I went to the truck that is actually currently on the Great American Food Truck Race on the Food Network Channel. This place is called Hodge Podge and I had this amazing Gouda Burger. This picture doesn't do it justice but it was amazing. The only thing better than that on the menu, was this Fagettaboutit burger which is a burger that has a fried slice of eggplant on it, covered in sauce and cheese. I just didn't think I could go back to work respectfully after eating that."}
