{"text":"This place is great!  We usually get carry out and the medium spice.  I have been to the buffet, but I have found it usually not as spicy as I like.  Still, the buffet is very good.    I recommend Swagat for Indian in Madison!"}
{"text":"I love ordering takeout from Swagat! And of course it's always best when you order a load of food and share with great friends.  This was some of the best chicken tikka I've ever had. Perfectly spiced and rich.   The samosas were delicate on the outside and a hearty mix of potatoes and peas on the inside.   The aloo mutter and chana masala were also fabulous! And everything was still piping hot after the drive home.  And of course, the best way to finish off Indian is with an order of gulab jamun!   Our total came to about $70, which served the seven of us dinner (we were stuffed!), and we even had some leftovers. Totally reasonable!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, I've eaten at Swagat many times for dinner and lunch, I've used their banqueting rooms, and I've hired them for catering.  It's good.  Really good.  With a few caveats - the lunch buffet is generally decent, but can be a little hit and miss, and a few of the dishes don't survive well under the heat lamps.  It's a fine enough way to sample a few things, but it's not the best way to experience indian food, because things don't always go together well.  Also, the default setting for spiciness is often \"wisconsin spicy\", particularly with the buffet.  However, they can, and will on request, bump up the spiciness (both the heat and otherwise).  Having the boti kabob at a spice level of what the chef said was \"how he would eat it\" was revelatory.  It wasn't blindingly hot, but it was deeply savory and complex in a manner that the \"standard\" spiciness wasn't.  Without asking,the standard spiciness can be a smidge bland.    Their menu is huge and features both north and south Indian specialties.  The north indian specialties seem to be the best best - the south Indian utthapam were good but the iddli were a little dry.   I've never had a bad tandoor dish there, though, and the naan is always excellent.   Service is almost always prompt and attentive.  Almost too attentive - it always seems like there's a waiter nearby trying to refill my water glass, which can be a bit disconcerting.  We hired them to cater our wedding, and it worked extremely well.  It was a big hit with our guests, the caterers showed up promptly with a nearly perfect amount of food (we had enough leftovers for a few lunches but we weren't swimming in leftover palak paneer), Mr. Singh was very friendly and helpful, setup was a breeze, and the price was quite reasonable."}
{"text":"A tad pricey for dinner, but definitely tasty! The naan is served hot from the tandoor, and the chicken tikka masala is among the best I've had (although the \"cubes\" of chicken breast were more like large chunks). If you like paneer (Indian curd cheese), definitely try the paneer jalfrazie. Finally, the mango lassis are outstanding, with lots of mango flavor!"}
{"text":"Yummy food! Their chapati taste like home made. All the food the we ordered are delicious. Staff are helpful giving order suggestions"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in Madison, in my opinion. The food quality is exceptional and the price is very reasonable, especially for lunch buffet. The mix of food is well chosen, varying from Punjabi to South Indian to Indo Chinese to West Indian. The ambience is great at dinner time and above average during lunch buffet. Go try the mango icecream if you are a fan of Indian desserts."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery through Mr. Delivery and once I received, there was no silverware or napkins from the restaurant. I ordered chicken briyani n there was very less meat. The box was stuffed with rice."}
{"text":"I called to inquire about the ingredients of a few items because my wife has an allergy to dairy and soy. After quizzing whoever picked up the phone about making sure that the ordered dishes did NOT have dairy or soy, I placed a $50+ order.  Thank goodness for my wife's intuition!  She called back (after being disconnected or hung up on) to find out that that they DO use dairy and soy in the dishes that she would eat.  We immediately canceled our order and were very disappointed with the experience.  Note to restaurants: allergies are a serious thing.  Take the time to read the labels before you tell people it's ok to eat at your establishment.  Vegetable oil often is made with soybeans.  It's takes less than a minute to read a label."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best Indian food in Madison. The service is also excellent. The prices are high, but that is the case for all of the Indian restaurants in town. I would recommend going to the buffet as it is the best value overall."}
{"text":"Love this place. Well worth the drive to the west side. I've eaten here about four times,  only for dinner. I've had their veggie samosas, chicken tikka masala, chana masala, chicken vindaloo, tandoori chicken, mango lassi, and naan. I've dined-in three times and was seated pretty quickly however, one night I came to pick up my to-go order on a Friday evening and waited about 30 min (which was in addition to the time they told it would be ready). At any rate, it's delicious food and is an establishment I will continue to frequent."}
{"text":"Dear Swagat where have I been I didn't meet you before?? I just wanted to say I am so happy I did today :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) I have tried other indian buffets and I could taste the big difference. It is the same price as the other Indian restaurants but I don't mind as long as it is quality food and it was indeed. My hubby and I were seated in a table where all the people passed by next to us but I enjoyed the food so much I felt the world around me disappeared and I just focused on the fireworks this amazing food made me see.  Things that really pop compared to other Indian buffets, chicken tikka masala, it was so tender and the sauce so well done (others tend to be lemony), Vegetable pakora and samosas (the breading was thin enough to taste the beautiful flavors of the veggies and also so golden and crunchy!)  paneer kadahi ( nice small cottage cheese pieces with a heavenly creamy sauce). Their biryani rice was colorful with small chicken pieces and it tasted soo good! My God I don't even know how to continue explaining how good the food was, in a sentence, it was such a pleasure to eat such a variety of flavors in every single bite.......mmmm, I suspect this new acquaintance and I will become good friends....to be continued......"}
{"text":"This place gets three stars for it's dinner options, which are wonderful. However, I would call service here sub par. As in, if you are able to ever order a soda, do not expect to be able to flag down the waiter to get a refill...ever. I went to the lunch buffet once, and while it was ok, as many reviewers have said, the food is lukewarm. I also didn't like that the naan was covered in garlic/butter. And service at the lunch buffet was non-existent. I waited 15 minutes before I could order a soda. I still recommend this place to people, but just be prepared for long waits and less than average service."}
{"text":"delicious and fast! this lunch buffet left little to be desired.  there were two soups, a tossed salad with several dressings, including yogurt rice and something that tasted just like tzaziki sauce. lots of chutneys; pickle, onion, mango, and tomato, to name a few.  all of the vegetarian items were scrumptious. and i'll be darned if i can remember exactly what they had... spinach and chickpeas, and some curry potato zucchini dish. also, rice with vegetables, and plain basmati rice with which to soak up the curried yummness.  a co-worker gave her thumbs down to their tandoori chicken... but you'll have to try for yourself. it's well worth the adventure at only $8.39 with tax!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the lunch buffet. There was a good variety of vegetarian and meat dishes. I really enjoyed the chili paneer and vegetable biryani. Everything tasted fresh and was kept at an appropriate temperature. Nothing special about the interior of the restaurant, but the staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"My family and I love Swagat. We eat here or order takeout at least once a month and have never been disappointed. Everyone who works there is always super friendly."}
{"text":"Called 30 minutes after they opened for dinner. Ordered the butter chicken and could not continue to enjoy it without trying to take out  bones and pieces of spices out of my mouth! Also, NOT a very generous amount of meat at all! I got strips of meat! STRIPS! I was lucky and got one chuck of dark chicken meat & that was it!   SUPER UNPLEASANT trying to enjoy my meal with chewing literally kernels of spice! Yuck! The sauce was thick and tomato based so I couldn't identify what I was really scooping up unless I felt it with my finger. My order was rushed and not made well.   Anyway if you want to pay for over priced curry with  70 percent sauce and 30 percent meat and don't mind big kernels of spice this is your joint."}
{"text":"My family came in for the lunch buffet and it was literally the worst service in the world. After we finished eating we decided to sit and settle our stomachs before we left and literally not even a couple minutes later one of the waiters came up to us and said, \" Aren't you ready to leave yet? We have people waiting so we need you to leave so we can clean the table.\"   Are you kidding me?! SERIOUSLY!? That was more than rude, that was unacceptable! I get that you're busy, but to push us out like that? We just finished eating! I guess all they really care about is the money, not the customers satisfaction.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is fantastic. I highly recommend going here to eat during their lunch buffet hours, however I am sure their dinner menu is great too. Very clean and attentive waiters. Totally worth checking this place out :)"}
{"text":"Always fantastic. Service is attentive, food is outstanding, and the ambience is nice.  High recommendation for Indian food in the Madison area.  My personal favorite dish is the chicken tikka masala."}
{"text":"Awesome indian food. Affordable prices. Ton of varieties to choose. Full value for money spent."}
{"text":"We went for the lunch buffet, which I only found to be mediocre. The food had it's flavor, but did not seem to be as authentic as I would have hoped. Maybe it's because I live in California, and my Indian food expectations are high, but I wasn't terribly impressed by this place."}
{"text":"This is one of the best lunch buffets that I have ever been to! Don't be afraid to try dishes that you haven't tried yet. You don't even have to know what the dish is; every dish is great! The chicken tikka masala was excellent, and the daals were good.   I live in Minneapolis, but I often consider driving all the way to Madison to get some Swagat!"}
{"text":"I can't remember going to an Indian restaurant in the past, so I wasn't sure what to order. I took a chance with a chicken dish and it was really good. The service was also very good. I'll return here again!"}
{"text":"Great if you are looking for Indian comfort food.  Their lunch buffet was beyond reasonable in price and had a tremendous selection that was kept freshly replenished throughout the brunch time.  Skip the naan that they bring to the table and try the garlic naan on the buffet,  We feasted on so many vegetarian items as well as \"grilled\" fish (that appeared to be breaded, and was delicious), and some very tasty chicken.  The Tandoori chicken was a bit dry and the other was delicious, but breaded and fried.  So.. good comfort food.  Many more fried items than the Indian buffet I frequent on the Square downtown Madison, but very delicious.  The vanilla pudding with fruit chunks of pineapple and papaya is comfort food at it's best.  Enjoy when you are famished."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for the lunch buffet. The five stars is mostly due to the service. The staff came by frequently to refill our glasses and clear our plates. They were very friendly, especially to my three-year-old (and his lunch was free! That was awesome). The chicken dishes were extremely tender. I just wish there was a little more spice in some of the options. The beef was a bit tough. It may have benefited from a lower temp, longer cook time. There was a dish with paneer that was pleasantly crispy on the outside while being smooth and savory inside.  Shout out to the staff member who was doing sidework at a table when we left, thanked us, and told us to have a good day. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"I come here every single time I'm in Madison. Excellent Indian food at a very reasonable price!! The appetizer grilled fish is the best! Servers are very attentive and they always refill the food in the buffet."}
{"text":"Excellent food, some of the best Indian dining in the city. They take the trouble to rotate different dishes at their lunch buffet, not just the same old same old."}
{"text":"Had carry-out once from Swagat. I may not be an expert on Indian curries, and I'm not usually one to criticize strongly, but I have ordered my fair share of saag paneer (favorite dish). In a word, bland...not that it wasn't spicy, but simply that it had basically no flavor. Bland enough that although Swagat is just down the road I have yet to be tempted to order a second dish. May try their lunch buffet someday to sample a range of their dishes, but until then, I'm underwhelmed..."}
{"text":"This restaurant has some of the best Indian in town. Their samosas are obviously homemade, and their chicken tikka is so good. My husband loves the hot vindaloo, with chicken. We take out from here all the time!"}
{"text":"Their lunch buffet did not disappoint. Incredible vegetarian options, soups, sauces and naan. Would love to return the next time I am in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"LOVE this lunch buffet. Never been for dinner (that's why I gave it only 4 stars and not 5). The buffet is always excellent. Lots of variety with hot dishes, tons of flavor. Always some beloved common dishes and some surprises if you're looking to try new things. (I've seen goat curry.) The waitstaff is helpful and nice, and hands down for me it's the best Indian buffet in the city."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is a great place for Indian food in our area. Huge tasty buffet selection at reasonable price. The chutneys here are the best! My favorite appetizer makes a great lunch (the samosa chat is the bomb!). Service doesn't hover but is quick, kind and attentive. Their curry flavors are top notch. My partner tried the chicken shahjahani, which would normally not sound appealing to me but oh heaven, the sweet almonds sang thru the cream sauce. Try it or really anything else! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my Indian home food in Madison away from my home city of Kolkata. I eat here when I want to have authentic Indian food which is sorely missing in many other restaurants in Madison. The best Indian food Madison has to offer, for sure. Great food, great service and I will recommend to anyone wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"It is very hard to find Indian restaurants that carry southern India options so I'm a fan of Swagat for that alone. Their dosa's are huge and filling for two meals, especially with an app. My husband ordered goat, and quickly remembered why he does not order goat out, typically very boney and fatty, which was the case for Swagat. All in all, we will be back for more dosa!"}
{"text":"The food is quite good and the restaurant is nice and comfortable. I wouldn't qualify the food as amazing, but it is quite tasty and enjoyable. I've always shared the non-veg dinner for 2, which is a LOT of food for 2 people. If you want to extend it to 3 people you could just order that and add a dessert and soup. The dinner portion is plenty. Would also work fine for a family of 4 with 2 young kids probably. Favorite dish in that is the shrimp korma, the one with the yellow curry."}
{"text":"Nice place for trying Indian food. Can't say it's authentic because my Indian friend says it could be SUPER spicy while it's actually not, but I feel like it very good.  Highly recommend their mango ice cream and grill fish!"}
{"text":"When I visit Madison, Swagat is always on my list of restaurants. Always fantastic! Always friendly!  /"}
{"text":"Nice place, good food. Very welcoming..ppl are nice. I had somosa and pakora they were nice. Also chicken tabduri and chicken tikka.masala was good"}
{"text":"My husband begs to go here on a regular basis. I haven't been to the lunch buffet, but everything on the menu I've tried has been really good. The husband has only ever ordered the chicken tikka masala and refuses to try anything else. ever. I think he'd pick it as his last meal."}
{"text":"Still excellent.  I've tried many Indian Restaurants and none come close to Swagat.  This is our go to restaurant.  I wish it had online ordering for pick up orders but the food is excellent and we will continue to keep coming back.  I've brought several friends/family here and they all love it as well."}
{"text":"My Mom and I decided to go to Maharaja on Odana Rd for dinner this past Tuesday. However, once we pulled up in the parking lot we noticed Maharaja was no longer there. Instead it is now the Tandoori House. I briefly looked up some reviews on the Tandoori House and they were pretty average. However, I noticed Swagat had overwhelmingly positive reviews so we decided to go there instead.  We were promptly greet and seated. The dinner menu is very expansive, they have so many menu offerings it's a bit overwhelming at first. Although I didn't order off of the Southern India menu, I think it's nice they offer the specialties of that region. They were playing Indian music which I could appreciate. I would much rather listen to Indian music than standard American Pop music.   I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo and asked the waiter if I could request spinach be added to it. He informed me that spinach wouldn't compliment the meal well because it would become to bitter and the sauce wouldn't taste right. I really appreciated his honest feedback and culinary expert response. Once I tasted the dish I realized he was right and that the spinach wouldn't have done the dish any justice.   We were served complimentary Papadam with the meal and several refills of them, which I appreciated. They can be eaten so quickly, and some Indian restaurants are not as generous with serving you more of them.  The garlic Naan we ordered was extremely fresh and delicious.   The Chai tea was also good as well as the Black Dal my Mom ordered.   While we were dining there some of the wait staff were busy cleaning the tables and putting clean table cloths underneath the glass table covers. I appreciate the fact that the restaurant is kept so clean, particularly the tables. Some restaurants with glass table tops rarely put clean new table cloths on.   I am interested in trying their lunch buffet sometime and further items on their menu. If those are also impressive, I won't hesitate to give them five stars."}
{"text":"This is my favorite indian restaurent.It is good place for lunch buffet .All items realy have indian test.The owner is nice & friendly.Recomand to visit."}
{"text":"I am an Indian and I love Indo-chinese food. Was excited to see manchurian on the menu Worst Manchurian you can have!! The uttapam was very sour too! Had some chaat which was okay. I told the waiter that the manchurian was really bad and he did nothing about it. Do not recommend :/"}
{"text":"My family has come here numerous times for their lunch buffet.  It is consistently good.  The servers are usually attentive.  They take away your plates and refill your water in a timely manner.  The food here is really good too, and great quality.  I really like their chicken tikka masala and their goat curry.  The goat is really tender, and the tikka masala is really flavorful.  They've got a great variety of food at their buffet, and their desserts, especially their caramel flan and mango ice cream, are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Belated review from a June 2015 visit:  We ordered the Veggie Samosa ($4.50), Veggie Pakora ($3.95), Tandoori Chicken ($13.95), Chicken Tikka Masala ($13.95), and a mango Lassi ($3.50).  We had a plus one with us, our pup and we asked if we could sit outside. The staff happily obliged and set up a nice table for us outside with place mat, silverware and all. After placing out order, they quickly placed a trio of chutney and papadam on our table. There was a mango chutney, a sweet tamarind, and mint. The mango was the favorite, containing tiny delicate cubes of fresh mango.  The mango Lassi was brought out next and deserved it's own course to be appreciated. It was a hearty thick blend of yogurt and mango, it was absolutely heavenly. It had a milkshake consistency and tasted just as sweet.  Samosa and Pakora appetizers arrived next, the hefty Samosa required you to work with your hands. Once opened, these hard-shelled purse pastry contained savory blend of spiced potatoes, onions, and  peas. Dip or dress them in chutney for even more added flavor! The Pakora were spiced veggie fritters. It was a bit more batter than I would like liked, but it was not greasy.  The Tandoori Chicken arrived in a cash iron dish topped with red onions and green peppers that were sizzling. The Tikka Masala arrived in a cute hammered stainless steel serving bowl. Both arrived with a side of Basmati rice. The presentation alone was impressive! But the flavors were truly outsanding! You could really taste the hours of marinating and distinct smokiness of the chicken from being cooked in the tandor. The chicken had flavor through the meat and was tender to the fork. The Tikka Masala is my go to, like judging a burger joint by a good ol' fashion hamburger. While it didn't contain the heat I was hoping for, it was a well blended curry with tender pieces of chicken.  Throughout our entire dining experience, the staff made the constant trek out to our lone outdoor table, with a smile on their face each time.  I will give a warning that these items are very rich and traditionally, many Indian dishes are marinated and concurrently cooked with yogurt, just be aware of your own tolerance for lactose."}
{"text":"The food was decent, nothing to complain nor rave about... I'm not from the area so I can't compare it to any other Indian food but I left satisfied."}
{"text":"Wow!  This is my favorite restaurant.  An indication that it is good is that it is almost always busy, and always has Indian people eating there.  It is busy, but I still just love the ambiance, and the food is really good.  My taste buds say so, and my Indian friends who know Indian food also say so.  Highly recommended!  Lunch Buffet is best."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good indian restaurant. Some of the items on the lunch buffet were really good. It was really crowded and we had a fairly decent group of 7 people so it was a little wait till we got the table.  The ambiance was pretty good and food was pretty good."}
{"text":"I love to cook, I really do. That being said the only cuisine that I wont cook is Indian. That is because nothing matches moms cooking. Well except maybe Swagat (nicknamed \"Swags\").  Swagat is hands down the best indian food in Madison, unrivaled by it's many, many competitors. It offers a token of diversity to this great town that is difficult to come by. Their food is consistenly good, no matter what day you come.  For the newbie, I strongly suggest you come during the day so you may try the lunch buffet. Many people who hear buffet shy away from a restaurant. I certainly understand and appreciate the concern, but, for Indian food, you want a buffet. The food is fresh and importantly there is variety. The lunch buffet will offer a plethora of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options covering a wide variety of tastes. I guess the other nice thing is you could peek at what is the most popular options amongst patrons and receive some suggestions of what to try. Finally, the buffet offers some of the more popular Indian desserts that people crave. During weekdays, fresh naan will be served to your table. On weekends, the buffet offers probably ten more food options. Finally it is a very affordable lunch, coming in around fourteen dollars with a soft drink. I think this goes without saying but, to clarify,  this is an all you can eat event.  Going to dinner is a great option as well but you may need a little more skill navigating the menu andyou will also be spending a lot more money to enjoy the variety that is offered at lunch time.  For those of you who don't know what to order, some popular options include palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, and the tandoori mix grill. The first two mentioned dishes are those that are traditionally eaten with bread or rice. The last one is a mix of meats that are cooked in a traditional tandoori oven. The mix grill usually comes with tandoori shrimp and chicken alongside various kebabs.  Finally, for those of you with tree nut allergies, I'd strongly recommend you make sure the staff knows of this. Indian dishes are notorious for having ground up tree nuts to thicken and enrich gravy. The dishes I mentioned above are free of tree nuts at Swagat. Finally, the staff are friendly and well informed, so they should be able to easily navigate you through menu."}
{"text":"Do you like uncooked Naan dough, and bland saag, and inedible pickled veggies? If so, than this is the place for you. And only for the low low price of $45. Super fast delivery though...maybe that explains the undercooked naan"}
{"text":"My fiance and I always drove by this place and always said we wanted to try it but we are both not familiar with Indian cuisine so i think we were worried we may not like it.  WOW were we wrong!  It's delicious.   Great food, great service.  The menu can be a bit overwhelming but just ask one of the servers and they are happy to recommend anything based on things you like.  They ask the right questions!  We have been twice for dinner and keep telling ourselves we need to go back for their lunch buffet.  We were walking by the lunch buffet set up last time we were there and one of the staff came over and asked us if we had ever been to the lunch.  He then proceeded to tell us what all they serve and what's in it and that on the weekends they offer a lot more choices.  So helpful! We can't wait to go back for the lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"I've eaten in a lot of great Indian restaurants around the US since traveling in India many years ago and Swagat is the best of them all.  Each dish had its own unique flavor and Swagat is the first Indian Restaurant I've been to in the US that offers a selection of Southern India dishes, something I've never had the chance to explore before.  Service was excellent and the servers are knowledgeable about the menu and the differences between dishes from different parts of India.  Very extensive menu, so I'll have to go back again and again to try  everything, which I really look forward to."}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken. Flavor was great but won't be back. 50% cartilage, 10% bone, 40% chicken.  Really pretty gross, and almost swallowed some of the bones."}
{"text":"Best indian food in town, Lunch Buffet is just AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't found a dish I don't like. The lunch buffet is great, but the lamb curry is even better. My wife and I are huge fans."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Madison.  I always get the Chicken Vindaloo and my husband gets the Chicken Shahi Korma.  The ingredients are fresh and tastes authentic... love it!"}
{"text":"We ordered food for a birthday party! There were 40 people waiting at the party for lunch that was supposed to be delivered at 1130. We called them at 1215 because the food wasn't delivered yet. And they said the order was misplaced! That's all. No regret, no nothing!  And we visited them at 105 pm and they gave me a business card asking me to call the manager and that they are not responsible. Of course the manager didn't answer! Why the hell should I be calling someone for anything. No one cares here. No one takes the responsibility! I regret for making an order her and for trusting them for my kids first birthday party! Ridiculous! I can't give them 0 stars so giving them 1 star! Ridiculous!  And they offered me tea to console me! Worst behaviors ever!"}
{"text":"We ordered the veggie dinner for two meal (which is enough food for 3) and the chicken tikka masala. The spice level was great (spicy!) and the food was delicious. There was a lot of food - we will have leftovers for days. Love that this place delivers!"}
{"text":"Swerve yourself on over to Swagat for some samosas, naan, and tikka masala.  !  I love Swagat for dinner! It's so close to 5 *'s, just lacking in a bit of music ambience and a warmer temperature. I have always been cold here. Not really sure why.  Anyway...the naan, garlicky naan. Yum, yum, yummy!! The vegetarian or chicken tikka masala is heavenly, incredible, and such a treat!! Oh my goodness...the food gets all 5 *'s from me. No question. .  The service is great; the staff is very attentive. I love the stainless steel bowls most sauce dishes are served inside too! At the conclusion of your meal, you are provided a hot hand towel as well."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Indian food and Swagat is the best of the best. Yes, it is a little pricier than your average Indian joint, but I would definitely say it's worth the splurge now and again. Everything we had was swimming in deliciously vibrant sauces and the naan had a drool-worthy, flaky texture layered in a way I hadn't seen before.   I haven't yet tried the lunch buffet, but I assume it's scrumptious and easier on the wallet. Still, I definitely recommend Swagat for a nicer Indian dinner with a friend or loved one (or even by yourself if that's what you're into)."}
{"text":"My go to place for dosa in Madison! They have very good ghee masala dosa and rava dosa! :)  I think that the dinner here is much better than lunch if you're a fan of south Indian food. And this place also has the best malai kofta I've ever eaten in Madison! People are courteous too. Thanks guys! :)"}
{"text":"Most important fact you need to know: Swagat serves decent South Indian cuisine. You can find these items on the last page of their menu.   We ordered their masala dosa, which is a crispy savory crepe made from lentil/rice flour and wrapped around spiced potatoes. This dosa was the size of a leg of lamb. It came with a cup of bland but spicy soup, a welcome break from the dense filling, and two types of sauces. I will order this again.   It was my first time trying tamarind rice and it came with a creamy pachadi sauce. Eaten together, this dish was a series of senses-blowing contradictions that I didn't know existed. It was soft but crunchy, tart but creamy, fragrant but earthy. The rice was studded with these nutty seeds, or maybe just tiny nuts, which I wasn't sure I could eat at first. I imagined this is what a squirrel must feel like having just discovered premium-grade bird feed. My life is changed.   Their chicken madras, dark meat cooked in a sauce with coconut and herbs, came with rice. This was good, but I like almost anything cooked in coconut.   Service is no-nonsense and a bit detached. After the first 3 bites of food I forgave them though, and our waiter was nice enough split our mango lassi into two glasses when we said we wanted to share one.   Of course, the experience wouldn't be complete without a spoonful of digestive near the entryway - anise seeds and candy coated fennel seeds. I left with a round belly and looking forward to leftovers. I love a place where I can get two full meals for the price of one."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a different Indian restaurant while in town this week and I think I found the one I would frequent if I lived here.  I would agree that due to ambiance and set up, like others have written, this is not a five star. The food and service help make it a four star.  I had the Goat Malabar, I asked for it to be spicy and boy was it. The spice didn't take over the dish though. It just added to the overall taste. There were a few pieces of goat with bones on them but most of the meat was deboned so I was able to enjoy every bite.  I also got a side of the Cheese Naan. This had a good flavor, but I couldn't really taste the cheese inside so when I go back I will try a different type of Naan.  Overall, I would say worth the visit if you are looking for a good Indian dinner. The menu is large so I am sure you can find something you like on there."}
{"text":"This is second time at Swagat.  I'm a huge fan of Indian food, but until a recent job change, it was quite far out of my way.  First, the service is excellent. They weren't exceptionally busy today, but they were the first time we came and both times they were attentive and kind.     The Masala chai is a little less sweet than most Americans might be used to, but overall good.   The gohbi manchurian, a fried indo- Chinese califlower dish is a favourite of mine and it is delicious here.  Rich, crispy, while not being overly salty as I've had it before.  Likewise the butter chicken is a standard of excellence.... warm and comforting, buttery. Plus where many Indian places in Madison the chicken isn't strange chunks, but rather nice fresh cut looking pieces. The samosa aren't fairly standard, but for me the real standout was their chutney.   It was fresh tasting and of course free.    The only reason thing I found a bit odd.... they put marichino  cherries in their peshwary naan.  It was tasty, sweet and savory, but not quite as much fennel as I'd like... and the marchinos were.... were a bit odd.    I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a classic toned down Americanized Indian food. We ordered our food medium plus- didn't want to go hot not knowing how they will cook it. We should have gone with hot plus. The food was too mild for our taste. Everything needed extra salt.   We started with paneer pakoras. It was really good. The service was fast and courteous. We had egg dosa and masala dosa which was pretty good. The masala dosa stuffing wasn't great and the chutney could be much better.   We also had dal makhani, lamb vindaloo and naan. The dal makhani was disappointing. Literal translation of dal makhani and butter dal and I didn't find any butter or cream in the dal. The garnish was poor. The lamb vindaloo had the right flavor but desperately lacked salt. Naan was awesome. Probably the best thing I had tonight.   For people looking for authentic Indian food- I have had better. For those looking for toned down version of Indian - may be u should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Very good food. The starters are good. Huge selection. I really liked this place.. This is one of the best indian buffet places I've been to."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in Madison area. There is almost nothing more to say. I have dined in and taken out from here many many times and we have tried most things on the menu. I have had Indian from pretty much all of the places in Madison, and Swagat continues to be my favorite. We usually get the chicken tikka masala and the chicken curry, but then also mix it up with various other options. Everything is fantastic."}
{"text":"Tried this place once, small lunch buffet - really small - the vegetarian items were really salty. Service was ok, probably never coming back as there are better places to eat than here."}
{"text":"Swagat Indian Restaurant is the best Indian food in Madison, hands down. Friendly staff, an extensive menu, tantalizing aromas, delicious foods, and good prices all combine to form an amazing dining experience. Their naan is wonderful, their poori is a heavenly pillow of fried dough, and the lamb biryani is the best I've ever had, anywhere.  I've also eaten at their lunch buffet, which has a great variety of foods and is kept fresh because of constant replenishment."}
{"text":"I'm an Indian and appreciate good Indian food. The food was actually good. I'd give the food even a 4 star rating. The staff there, that's a whole different story. The person that sat me down and took my order was pleasant and courteous. But he vanished to the front of the restaurant soon after he took the order and there was someone else waiting on me. He came by the table and dropped off take out containers 15min before their closing time and announced to me that they were closing soon. Then he even proceeded to bring my bill over to the table when I hadn't even asked for it. He did not even care to offer any desserts. I then flagged another waiter and asked for a cup of tea. He was on his way to the kitchen to bring me some, but the other guy intercepted him and came over to my table and told me that they ran out of tea and that they close in 10min and so they wouldn't make me tea. What kind of a business/restaurant kicks customers out before closing time? Very very disappointed by the treatment I received and would warn everyone to steer clear of this place if you were heading there within an hour of their closing time. Swagat literally translates to \"welcome\" and I felt very unwelcome there."}
{"text":"I just can't get into Swagat... Their food is consistently not as flavorful as Dhaba, Minerva and other Indian restaurants around town.. Pretty sure they just need to add more salt.   Shortest review ever, but I'm pretty sure that said everything you'd need to know."}
{"text":"Swagat was recommended by our nephew and niece who are getting married and are our reason for visiting Madison this weekend. We were thrilled with quality and quantity of food! Just right portions, everything tasted very fresh, attentive service made treating other family members visiting with us a joy. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible and they mixed our payment with someone else's. There food was just ok"}
{"text":"Nice Pakoras and nice people! I ate the lunch buffet there one sunday on my way through town, and three hours later i realized I left my jacket. I panicked, called them right away, and asked if i could send a pre-paid priority mail envelope to them for returning it. They were very nice, and i got my jacket back five days later. Whew, and thanks, Swagat!"}
{"text":"This is one of the finest Indian restaurants I've been to lately. Wisconsin is blessed to have great Indian restaurants which are way better than Chicagoland. We were in Madison for the sunflowers fields and landed here for a Sunday buffet. The spread was awesome and so many items and yet so distinct. This was the very few places where I got Bhatura (Indian fried flat bread). Other yumminess included shrimps, fried fish, chicken fritters and the standout dessert called gajar halwa (carrot pudding) I'd be back whenever I am in the city :)"}
{"text":"Still somewhat new to Indian food, but went with family as this is one of their favorite spots. The food was good and I would go with the medium spicy flavorful for the full effect. The waiters seemed nice"}
{"text":"I order for mutton curry medium spicy, they served mild like mutton masala or some kind of north sweet curry Mutton piece was so big I can't even eat properly I have to fight with meat pieces in front of unknown people Very bad experience."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and were seated promptly. It's a pretty decent sized place with two (connected) seating areas. There really wasn't much down time between when we ordered and when the food got there. I got aloo tikki as an appetizer and saag paneer for the main course, along with onion kulcha and paneer naan. All of it was amazing and there was enough left over for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"This our #1 Indian place to go near our home. It's always busy so the food is always fresh and hot. They change the items time to time but the favorites are always there. Goat curry. Yum. The waitstaff is always friendly yet out of the way yet on top of everything. I have only eaten the buffet but I'm sure the menu items are just as great.   Totally in love with those nan breads."}
{"text":"Very yummy.  Decent sized buffet.  Great lunch option for a weekday.  Every time we've been there, the food's been warm and the service has been excellent.  Definitely make sure you save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"The first thing that struck us is how cocky this young waiter was.He was probably thinking \"WE AT SWAGAT ARE THE BOMB!!\". Son, I just moved here from the San Francisco bay area.I know and cook Indian food and trust me you are NOT the bomb.Far from it. Food was OK.Nothing exceptional and definitely not what the reviewers here are going ga ga about but that is personal choice.We tried the chicken tikka and the vindaloo which was flavorful but definitely not worth the price we were paying. Quantities were not adequate for the amount we were paying.Is Indian food really that expensive here in Madison? The prices here are ridiculously overpriced for Indian food and every single Indian restaurant has the same price range for all dishes which would make me believe that they have some sort of Indian restaurant owners union that decides on what the prices are going to be!! Another thing that irks me is the inclusion of south Indian food along with your Rogan Josh menu which raised a big flag for us regarding the quality of the food. No serious Indian restaurant owner would EVER include a idli sambar dosa on a menu that has Rogan Josh or biryani on it.PERIOD! Just looking at the quantity of dishes on the menu and we knew this was going to be your below average Indian fare.Definitely not coming back here.Unless of course the prices go down..way down."}
{"text":"I regret I wasted our  time,  money and appetite. Definitely not recommended for Indians. Food is not authentic,  refrigerated coconut Chutney,  seriously?  Gobi Parantha was too oily. Veg Biryani had no flavors and poorly chopped veggies. Mysore Dosa was flavorless and inconsistently spicy. We had to leave it. we reported and they removed it from billing. That was not the idea for reportibg it. We left an approx amount for the Dosa on the table. Their Plain Dosa was good but chutney was freezing and sambar didn't reach till half the dosa was over. Chai wss tasteless. Complimentary Veg Pakora was good."}
{"text":"I picked up a couple biryani dishes and some naan for lunch.  The biryani was good although, apparently, the blander palate of Wisconsonites has affected their judgement.  I ordered \"extremely hot\" and took pains to explain that I know heat and wanted it so hot his grandpa wouldn't eat it.  It may have had a dash of pepper in it, but I'd give it \"Mild\" at best.  The naan was a little ho-hum.  I've had much better naan."}
{"text":"Been here several times for the lunch buffet and have always found it to be delicious.  I have had Indian cuisine a handful of times, and this is absolutely the best so far.  Several times I've been here was with Indian friends I work with periodically.  They agreed it is very good however some of the flavors are adjusted to match American tastes.    I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten here a number of times. Always busy, but there is a lot of room. Wait staff is very friendly. The lunch buffet is the best value. The food is fantastic. Great variety of Indian food. Good Nan bread and great Biryani. Prices are very reasonable for a family. We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible!! I do not really care about the quality of the food since the service here was so bad that I will never go here again. The people were very rude. If negative star was an option, I would certainly have opted for that."}
{"text":"Very good. Could use less MSG, but a fantastic deal! The quality of food is pretty good, which is why I think it could omit the MSG."}
{"text":"Taaaaasty! If you like Indian, go here and nowhere else in Madison!  My husband and I stuffed ourselves at Swagat and enjoyed every bite of our appetizer and entrees. We will definitely go back.  Swagat had a different style of service. I don't think the same person ever came to our table more than once. It was still prompt and professional service -- just no specific server.  When my husband ordered his entree, the server asked if he would like it spicy. So my husband made the mistake of thinking that he likes spicy foods, so sure, order spicy. He quickly learned that his concept of \"spicy\" -- which is probably the same idea of \"spicy\" shared by most Americans -- differs from the authentic Indian cuisine definition of \"spicy.\"   Just a fair warning: be nice to yourself and enjoy a \"mild\" entree at Swagat!"}
{"text":"I'm writing a review as I eat .. The appetisers were awesome ... Especially the sambar vada (should say it is the best in Chicago Milwaukee area ) moving on to the main course.Kothu parota , chicken vindaloo , Dal Fry and Garlic naan was what we ordered . I must say the chicken vindaloo was awesome and the Kothu parota was sooo good that I ended up broadcasting to yelp that this restaurant is the place to be .especially when you are in this part of the town . Or like us if you don't mind driving 60 miles just to have good food"}
{"text":"Went here for a dinner with my girlfriend. We ordered the royal non vegetarian dinner for two. It was $45 but you get quite a spread. Soup Chicken pakora appetizers Three entrees And rice Plus a desert. It was all so good. Staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"We stopped here to try Indian Cuisine for our first.  We were Indian food virgins that wanted to indulge.  Were have heard this place is the best authentic food from many friends.  Reviews only backed up what we were already told.  I will admit we were a little nervous, because we are not very versed in how to eat it, what pairs with what, or maybe I should say the proper way of preparing our plates.  The staff here took away all our worries.  They were kind, friendly, easy to understand, patient, and more than happy to explain what foods went with what.  They explained every sauce, different chutneys , soups and dishes to great detail.  Basically explained to us the way to make the meal authentic to their culture.  Lucky for us this place is a buffet, so we nibbled on everything.   To our surprise we truly enjoyed almost everything we tried.  We were expecting all the food to be spicy based on what typically people associate with this style of food.  All we ever heard was lots of curry seasoning and spices.  Which is clearly the main ingredient in the food, but not all of it.  All the way around we were happy with the new experience we had.  We always enjoy trying new things and being adventurous with food.  If you want to mix things up for yourself or your family and you have never indulged in Indian Cuisine.  I highly recommend trying this place out for something out of the normal.  No reason to be scared!  This was a very clean atmosphere, large place, awesome staff, and reasonably priced place tucked away in a very nice area of Middelton, WI."}
{"text":"The food is very authentic and delicious. We ordered non-vegetarian combos for two. The food was way more than we could eat. We took out the rest of it because it was too good and we didn't want to waste it. Very recommend this place. Good price with good quality."}
{"text":"I've been a couple of times and ordered delivery as well. The food is always flavorful, spicy as heck, and delicious. They do not mess around with the heat spices!   Recommendation: get the paneer tikka masala--it's cheese. In masala."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant ever!! I get the butter chicken(chicken mahkani) medium spicy to hot most of the time, the vegetable pakora are the best I've ever had! I may sound over excited but you have to try this place, you won't regret it. I have been to all of the Indian restaurants in Madison, this is the one to beat. Oh, don't forget the mango ice cream tastes super authentic, it's just delightful!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Came here for dinner. Truly great service and the food was some of the best Indian food I've had in Madison."}
{"text":"On my way back from Wisconsin dells, we googled searched for Indian buffet restaurant in Madison and this one came up with decent reviews. We stopped for buffet and it was amazing. Clean and big and awesome Indian buffet! The buffet here is better then the Indian restaurants  in Chicago ."}
{"text":"The best Indian buffet in town! We've been here for lunch multiple times last month, and each time we visited, Swagat offered a few different dishes in their buffet.   I really love Indian flavors and spices. But I'd been complaining a lot about the buffet options in Madison until I tried this one. Each dish has a different flavor, and if you are one of those people who can identify many tastes and smells, you'll enjoy every bit.  Also I eat strictly gluten free, and the staff has always been very helpful and knowledgeable about the ingredients.   Finally, if you like paneer, Swagat offers the best paneer in town!"}
{"text":"Oh me, oh my. Where have you been all my life?  I've had a couple of Indian dishes made by friends back in California, but I can't say I'm too knowledgeable about this cuisine. So needless to say, it took a while to figure out what to order.  My fiancé ordered the chicken tikka kadahi, medium spiciness. The coriander was very distinct, but soooo delicious. I ordered the beef mango, which I was weary about, but the sweetness of the dish brought me back to my childhood with similar Filipino dishes. Seriously. SO good.   We vowed to come back and try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Visiting the Madison area from northern Nevada, where Indian food choices are extremely limited. This was by far the best, most extensive Indian buffet I've had in the States. I lived in India for a year in the '80s and can't remember every single thing I loved to eat there, but I do remember spending many afternoons in Colaba in Bombay, eating Masala Dosas in a little upstairs restaurant. I'm always tickled when I find dosas on the menu at an Indian place, as it doesn't happen often.  We went out to dinner here, and our table of 6 let me do the ordering and recommendations. I was very impressed by the fact that when my husband ordered his meal \"hot\", they asked \"Wisconsin hot, or India hot?\" We're fairly adventurous eaters, so he said \"India\" and when he got it, it was definitely spicy. I wouldn't have wanted it much hotter, myself. I ordered the Masala Dosa, and  I wish the dosa itself had been a little crispier, but it was very good.  While we were eating, I saw a sign over the buffet that said Pani Puri! I was so excited - haven't had that since 1988 on the streets of Bombay. So, we went back for the buffet today, but no pani puri that I could see. After I tasted some of the other food, it didn't really matter. Nearly everything I tried was great! I generally never order Chicken Tikka Masala because we make it at home, and I almost never find a version out that I like better. When I eat Indian food out, I'd rather try the things I can't make myself. :) My husband tried it and said he likes ours better, so I didn't bother with it, as there was plenty else to enjoy.   Our waiter from dinner nearly a week ago saw us today and actually remembered that I liked masala dosas, which I find impressive. Even more impressive is that they had them in the buffet, too! Wow!  If we had a restaurant like this near us, we would be spending a ridiculous amount of money here. For those who like their Indian food more spicy (hot), all you have to do is ask. I personally feel this is a great representation of Indian food. As regards the price, I didn't find it excessive at all. I know how much money I spend at my attempts to make good Indian food at home (with all fresh ingredients) and figure you can spend what, $5-6 at McDonalds, getting a burger, fries and drink, or $10 for an all-you-can-eat tasty Indian buffet? No contest! Where we live, there's no way you're getting anything decent (ie - not fast food) for under $10 for lunch, so I thought the cost was absolutely reasonable."}
{"text":"Great weekend buffet ... we're definitely coming back!  Good range of options, stuff was cooked well, loved the service (attentive, pleasant) & most importantly  - the food tasted great .. as close as you can get to the real thing."}
{"text":"Very good food. The bread is addicting. The staff is extremely friendly and knows the menu inside and out."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! The lunch buffet had great variety with many non-vegetarian and vegetarian options that were all fresh and tasty. Service was excellent and the restaurant was very clean and welcoming. Highly recommend the cheese naan and chicken tikka masala. Of all the Indian food I've had in Wisconsin, Swagat easily takes home the title of best Indian food."}
{"text":"For Madison, it's probably a 4 to 5 star place. By Chicago standards, it's a 3 star. For New York standards, it's a 2 to 3 star restaurant.  Whenever the menu is vast and seems to caters to wide variety of North and South Indian cuisine, I get confused. The South Indian part me inside is excited going \"yay! I'm represented\" then a part me is skeptical of the quality when they try to please both cuisines.    Being with vegetarians, we tried shahi vegetable korma (this was bland and too creamy), paneer kadhi (I guess it was ok with the bell peppers balancing the spices), and the gravy style gobi manchurian ( tangy and fried balls in red sweet and sour sauce). The MIL got the masala dosa which I must say the sambar did pass for sambar.  Service was initially attentive but the food was super slow to arrive. They were rather busy with 2 other private parties going on as well  The best part was we ordered kulfi (Indian ice cream) at the end which was sooooo good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic.  I love Indian food and this is the best in town.  I have sampled many of the items on their buffet and liked them all.   I like spicy and/or savory, so the food could please people that liked mild or spicy.   In spite of HEATHER C. saying this is  in a \"NEW\" strip mall, the shopping center has been there for more than ten years.  In the late '90's, Atlanta Bread Company was in the opposite corner, and Ashman branch of the library is also here."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 5 rating! We were in town for couple of days and opted to go to this restaurant for dinner. Best decision made. The food was amazing and hospitality was excellent. When the host got to know this was our first time her gave us complimentary mango ice cream, which was out of this world!! I would only go here every-time i go to madison!"}
{"text":"We got take out from this restaurant and ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and Shrimp Korma that was recommended by Sarah.  We also ordered some bread recommended by the restaurant to go with this dish. They were friendly on the phone and pleasant at the time of pickup.  The restaurant is extremely clean from what I can tell from my brief first impression.   Everything looked orderly and well organized. They asked us what level of spice we wanted.  I chose medium expecting the food to be mild in spice as so many restaurants tone down their spice for the American palate.   I was happy to find the spice was indeed medium to my taste.  So if too hot is too hot for you expect a true approach to heat level by this restaurant. Both dishes were very good.  The chicken sauce was the better in flavor to my taste.   The rice came out of the box loose and cooked perfectly.  Nice job. We can't give this 5 stars as we have not eaten in house but for take out they did a terrific job and we will be going back."}
{"text":"I love Indian cuisine so I was excited to try Swagat since I drive by it everyday.    First off the outside does not match the inside.  I was expecting more contemporary decor.  For me it was airy and stark.  Not a warm environment.  The buffet line was kept clean and full which is nice.  Everyone working were busy which is nice also.  Many restaurants have a gaggle of people just standing around but not here.  My only real complaint is that I didn't get my drink I asked for.  But my water was kept full.  Wasn't the best I have had but definitely the best I have had so far in Madison."}
{"text":"Food - the food was just delicious here at Swagat, if I worked closer I would come here for lunch at least once a week! I have only tried lunch buffets here so I can't speak for the dinners, but I'd imagine it being just as good if not better. A variety of dishes were offered during lunch, including salad, a nice shrimp dish, garlic nan, lamb curry, and of course chicken masala. Desert included mango ice cream, which is just pure joy from every spoonful, fruit salad, and the traditional kheer. There were a couple more entree and desert dishes but I can't recall, so I have to check it out again soon! Another thing is that I've been here both on weekdays and weekends, and the weekends definitely have a larger variety of entree/desert  Price - 10$ for lunch buffet, reasonable  Service - waiters paid attention to our table, constantly asking if we needed our empty/used dishes to be taken away from the table. The thing that always seem to happen with buffets is that the fork/chopsticks get taken away when they take away the dish, so you may have to ask for those ~ 2 or 3 times during your meal. Good service overall  Overall - every time I was here the place was pretty packed. Definitely recommended for lunch buffet with a group of friends on the weekend for brunch. Skip breakfast if you have to :)"}
{"text":"Swagat is on the far west side of Madison.  The restaurant itself is part of a new strip mall just off of Old Sauk Rd.  The decor inside is nicer and newer than Maharaja's West and East side locations.  The food is pretty much the same as Maharaja's.  It's very, very good.  The prices are about the same as well.  The only thing I can really tell you is that if you are driving around Madison and you suddenly feel the need to have good Indian food you have three locations to choose from depending on your location.    Are you on the west side by West Towne mall?  Go to Maharaja's on Odana Rd.  Are you on the far west side by Old Sauk Rd?  Go to Swagat's.  Are you on the east side by East Towne mall?  Well then go to Maharaja's on Thierer Rd.    Easy."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've tried yet in Madison. I honestly don't know what took me so long to get out here, but I'm very glad I did.  Ordered the lamb vindaloo (asked for HOT, got medium - next time, will ask for extra hot and see how that goes). My date ordered the rogan josh. Both dishes were fantastic, and the waiter even brought more rice out to add to our to-go boxes without asking.  Personally, I thought the chai tea was a standout. It was not too sweet at all (which is a major sticking point with me and chai, usually). My date ordered the house mixed drink (forgive me - the name escapes me): something with citrus and mint. Very tasty!  We were very happy with the service. Water was filled as glasses tipped past the half-full point (which is super important - especially with Indian food).  Bathroom was very clean, and there was a fair amount of parking in the private lot.  I'm excited to come back and try the lunch buffet one of these days (maybe during a game to avoid what I'm sure will be giant hordes of people)."}
{"text":"Recently a few people asked me for a recommendation for an Indian buffet, and I gave them a variety of options based on what they preferred. This was because different Indian buffets had different specialties that distinguished them from their competition. Well now that I've been to Swagat, that is irrelevant now. Swagat is the culmination of every good thing from every other Indian buffet in the Madison area. They have both meat and vegetarian options - in fact, they have the largest food selection of any buffet I've seen thus far. They don't skimp on spice and flavor. They have tandoori chicken and fish, and flavorful to boot. Their mango lassi are not sickeningly sweet or made from synthetic mango flavor powder. They have really good desserts, including gulab jamun, those honey balls made from milk solids that I find absolutely divine. Other Indian buffets do one of these things well - this one does all of them. So logically, if you want to go to an Indian buffet, come here. I can't conceive of a reason to go to any of its competitors."}
{"text":"Swagat is my pick for best Indian in town so far.  I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.  The lunch buffet has good variety and is really tasty for food that's produced on a buffet scale.  The chicken tikka masala is consistently very good, but sometimes the vegetables are a little floppy.  I want aloo gobi/broccoli that resists a little bit when I eat it, you know?  I've been on a few occasions recently and they don't always seem to have a big appetizer selection on the buffet, and I haven't figured out the pattern for this.  The only answer seems to be collecting more data.    As an aside, the staff is absolutely hilarious with my kid.  They talk to her and make faces at her and stuff, and I think that's pretty awesome.  It makes the place feel friendly."}
{"text":"Even with the somewhat limited Indian options in Madison, there are MANY other places in town that serve better food.    We went to the weekend buffet.  Selection was limited but more importantly the food was BLAND, REALLY BLAND.  How Indian food can be bland is beyond me.    The food was also only lukewarm.  By the time we got to our table everything was borderline cold.  While the service was acceptable you have better options for Indian in Madison.  Go elsewhere for good food.    The weekend buffet at Maharaja on Odana, while not perfect, is a much better choice.  PS  To 'Sarah H', to live in NYC for 7 years and to not have Indian better than this is almost impossible."}
{"text":"A brief of my Saturday Lunch buffet experience.  Decor : Simple, traditional and thankfully clean for a buffet (I'm looking at you Asian buffets!!)  Food : Someone told me the variety on offer here is well above what you get elsewhere. Eh...NO...The variety is OK and lacking in some extents. The dishes laid out balance the gastronomical geographies of India quite well so folks from every corner should be fine! The taste was average at best. Most of the food was warm which isn't that common in buffets. The spices were a hit or miss in many a cases and none of their dishes impressed. None were offending though also so that's that.   Service : Clean and prompt. Good work on that.  Value : We paid over $30 for two with a Mango Lassi (Yogurt based drink), which seems on par with what we've shelled out at other joints. But IMO this ain't a second visit."}
{"text":"To start off, I don't typically eat much Indian food and this was my first Indian buffet. That being said, I was very impressed by the lunch buffet here. We came with a large group and were accommodated immediately. The buffet itself is kept hot and there are even desserts. There was a variety of options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike (and descriptions underneath the items for those unfamiliar with the items). They were all abundant and unique in their own way. The garlic naan was great and the classic items like chicken tiki marsala met expectations. I would say some items were just a bit salty but I think that's the nature of the food itself so not a huge deal.   There were appetizers and desserts available including flan and mango ice cream. This is a great place to go to overall and a perfect lunch spot for if you're ready to have a heavy, satisfying meal."}
{"text":"We went here last Saturday and had the buffet. I had some eggplant curry with most amazing deep richness, I ate way too much. I just think this place is outstanding. Everything tastes great, it's bright, well staffed and friendly. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"There is a reason why this restaurant continues to be best in Madison. It is a great Indian restaurant with rotating dishes that are delicious every single day.  While I gave it a perfect rating, the only downside can be volume (of patrons) and that's not necessarily their fault, it's a testament to how good the food is. There are a few dishes I look for, I believe it's called \"Chicken 65,\" which is a lightly breaded and fried chicken dish. Outside of this you can't really make a bad decision here."}
{"text":"I'm here to chime in and sing the praises of the lunch buffet. Swagat is a very attractive and large space in a corner mall. There are three separate dining rooms and one which would well serve a larger group of 20 or so at one very long table. Think family or business gatherings. The main dining area is very well-appointed, clean and appealing. Even in a self-serve mode, there are many servers eager to get you comfortable and ready for that East Indian smorgasbord. And what a smorgasbord it is. Soups, entrees and desserts, numbering at least 20 choices. Curried lamb, Chicken Tikka, Tandoori chicken, fried fish, and many takes on vegetables potatoes and rice. Freshness and flavor jumps out of every bite. Meats are tender. And there's not enough room on one's plate to try everything in one trip. The thing I appreciated the most beyond the food was the understated hospitality. No-one rushing you or slamming down your bill on the table. The gracious and efficient staff politely clears the old plates when you finish, and when you are ready, you just head to the cashier. My lunch companion and I had lots of time to chat, catch up on news, and to savor the delectable buffet. On a weekday, the place was about 90% full, and I am guessing the majority were there for the buffet. A great value, too, at $11.95. The Madison Magazine \"Best of Madison\" award is well-deserved. With food quality, service and ambiance, it's an unbeatable formula."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet ($10).  Service was good.  They brought a basket of hot, fresh naan to my table and it was 5 stars.  The buffet itself, as others have mentioned, is hit-or-miss.  Everything isn't quite as spicy as it should be, so make sure to get some of the pickle, mango chutney, and spicy sauces to go along with whatever you have.   I'll have to stop by for dinner one of these days and I know I'll be going back for lunch.    Forgot to try the desserts so I can't comment on them."}
{"text":"So far I've been pretty pissed off about what passes for Indian food in Madison. Most of it could be described as \"creamy with a distant rumor of spice.\" I'm telling you this so you will believe me when I say that hitting up the lunch buffet at Swagat is a good idea. Nothing you eat here is going to \"do the chainsaw\" on your lower GI tract (I consider this a bad thing) but compared to other places it is slightly better, with more variety, and pretty cheap. The garlic naan is great, and I always get some mango ice cream"}
{"text":"There is a reason why this restaurant continues to be one of the best in town. It offer all of the great Indian dishes that you know. I love their lunch buffet and stop in as often as I can, or order ahead. But for the first time ever I went there for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. We had a rich assortment of dishes and a tone of left-overs. My favorites are: mixed vegetarian platter, chicken pakora, garlic naan, poori, chicken tikka masala,  Best Indian food I've tried yet in Madison. I honestly don't know what took me so long to get out here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the lunch buffet and was not disappointed. Buffet selection was great and food quality was excellent- paneer masala and naan were very fresh. Dessert was excellent as well. Restaurant is very spacious and clean and wait staff is incredibly friendly. Best Indian Food in Madison!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch buffet on a weekday. The food was really good and they had a good variety for the price. I really enjoyed their appetizers especially. It was not crowded and the atmosphere was nice. Their grilled/fried fish was tasty."}
{"text":"The Paneer Tikka Masala here is literally my favorite dish at any restaurant ever.  The saag paneer, samosas, and verything else I've tried have been good too, but it's really hard to stray from the PTM. Service and atmosphere are mediocre, so I usually get take out, but the food alone merits 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"I ordered goat biryani for to go, It was not worth for the money they charged. I wouldn't recommend going to this place at all"}
{"text":"Wow, when you have experienced good/great Indian food and can even cook it, it is so hard to find restaurants who can rise to the occasion.  So, once again we find a subpar attempt.  Very disappointed, as the restaurant and area it resides in is just lovely.  However, be careful when entertaining your seating area..... sitting in the back might seem like a good idea, as it has additional booths by the window, but this area is for families with children.  And, the room is very bland..... just beige walls.   It looks like an add-on after thought.  So, with all that said, you can get somewhat decent Indian food here (except for the naan bread), but you'll leave feeling let down."}
{"text":"Hands down best Indian food in Madison.  I feel like I have said this before about another Indian restaurant but this time I mean it!   I think the thing that elevates this place is a couple of things: the level of service and the quality of the food.  The set up of this place isn't like other Indian buffets.  The space is huge and is decorated really nice.  It is a great place for a date or just to decompress during lunch.   The quality of the food stands out above others. The flavors are great and the food is perfectly seasoned.  One thing that I like about this place compared to other places is that they don't water down their lunch curry's.  I have been to other places and it seems like this happens a lot.  This place doesn't seem to do this so you are getting the full flavor of the food.  I usually order take out here and get the goat curry because it is seriously the best around.  Nice pieces of meat and really fluffy rice.  Another thing about this place is that the service is outstanding.  When I call in they are so polite and patient and the same when I pick up.  The person at the counter is so pleasant and we usually chat it up a bit before I leave.    Madison has SO many options for Indian food.  This place however is head and shoulders above the others!"}
{"text":"It is one of the better Indian restaurants in Madison The buffet spread is good..They have good food ..Good place for curries, south indian, north indian you name it!!"}
{"text":"Vindaloo, Vindaloo, Vindaloo, Vindaloo, na na Vindaloo, Vindaloo, Vindaloo, Vindaloo, na na Vindaloo, Vindaloo and we all like vindaloo  I had the chicken vindaloo for lunch and the portion size was good for two lunches. I tone down the spice at lunchtime because I have to talk to people for a living, but even the \"medium\" had a nice bite to it and the flavor of the vindaloo sauce is deep and rich.   However, I'm not impressed by quality of the chicken. There seems to be a lot of dark meat and pieces that if I were eating the chicken by itself, I would push aside. There are other Indian restaurants where the chicken is white meat pieces, and I strongly prefer that.   Overall, Swagat is a good place. The staff and ownership are friendly and they know what they're doing with the sauces. The lunch buffet is always a treat as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my friend's favorite places to go when we go out for dinner so I've been here quite often. We've almost always come here in a group around dinnertime and, while it is always busy enough to let you know that this is a good spot to go to, we've never had to wait.  I'm really big into curry and I've tried all of Swagat's curries at this point. My favorite is probably their beef saag. My least favorite is probably their fish curry. Their lamb curry is good but I can't taste the lamb flavor very much, so I prefer the beefy versions more. You can't go wrong with the biryanis and tandoori dishes here, either.  Their nans and aloo paratha here are great, especially the paratha. They are a little too oily sometimes but, most of the time, it's just right. My girlfriend asked me to make some parathas at home after trying Swagat's.  What's average here is the ambiance and the service. You can tell it's a lunch buffet place but it isn't off-putting. And all the staff are nice and I've never had a bad experience. These are just two things that don't stand out very much, but could.  Lastly, I really love their complementary papadum and sauces, and the fact that they have fennel seed mix for breath freshening near the exit. It's small things like these that make it feel more authentic."}
{"text":"I'll start by stating two facts. 1. Our visit was more than a week ago. 2. I have never really been a fan of Indian food.  That being said, let us get on with it.  We were welcomed with their Best of Madison 2016 award at the door and a host that was glad to see us.  The ample seating allowed us to be sat immediately.    Our server was quick to the table and spot on with the drink order.  On to the buffet.  I tried each of the offerings on the table at least once.  The vegetable cutlet appetizer and masala fish were both great.  My recommendation for all of those who venture in is a combination of sorts.  Trust me here.  Garlic naan + vegetable biryani + goat bhuna = BOOM.  Next time we go back, if these items are offered again, this is all I will eat.  For desert? Gulab jamun. All of it.  The sweet, syrup soaked amazingness was just what the doctor ordered.    In sum: Having never been a fan of Indian food before this visit, I will always be in the mood for it now.  Swagat offers a huge variety of excellence.  I feel like I need to hold back on the 5th star because I haven't tried many other places with the same offerings.  I'll be sure to explore and revisit to correct this."}
{"text":"Don't think I can ever go to an Indian restaurant for dinner again after this. Great lunch variety and the quality has always been good whether I sat down at 11AM or 2:30PM."}
{"text":"Good lunch buffet, and a solid dinner experience."}
{"text":"I have been to my share of Indian buffets and this is by far the best. My husband loves Indian food and I am not a huge fan. There are usually only a few dishes I enjoy. Swagat is unique because we both are able to find things we really like. There are so many options but I honestly don't think I have had anything I didn't enjoy there. The desserts are ridiculously good and the service is wonderful."}
{"text":"Great food!   I will keep coming back, the food is outstanding the service is great.    Fish chicken etc."}
{"text":"Stopped for the lunch buffet on a Saturday with my husband and a couple of friends. We were seated immediately and were able to jump right in the buffet line. Good thing, because it smelled AMAZING in there and I couldn't wait to get that yumminess in my tummy!   The only Indian food I've ever had before was chicken Tikka Masala, so I was excited (and a little nervous) to try other stuff. I'm glad I did. Tandoori chicken? YUM. Mango Chutney. Double YUM! I had a variety of veggie dishes and liked them all. The garbanzo bean masala had great flavor. Finished it all off with a delicious mango ice cream. I also love that they have each food item identified with a brief description of what it is you're eating. Very helpful to the newbie.   They did also have a beer, wine, and cocktail menu, though we just went with sodas and waters since we were going out for bevvies later.   I will definitely recommend Swagat to others, especially to people who've not eaten Indian food before. Their buffet is a great way to find out what you like. I will even more definitely be back again myself to try some more."}
{"text":"Best Indian cuisine and service in all of Madison. The food is cooked with the right spices and the chef is very creative in offering new menu items. You can't find that at any other Indian restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Rating for the weekend buffets ONLY!  Had weekend buffets twice. The starters are amazing and include pakora, chicken tikka and pain-puri among many others. Main course is packed with traditional vegetarian dishes likes palak-paneer, saag, different bhajis, okra and cholay. Chicken Biryani, Vegetable pulao and saffron rice are the best. Different types of naan go along well with the chicken and mutton curries. Sweat dishes are a perfect closing to this feast and include gulab-jamun, Kheer and specialty made mango ice-cream.  Service is decent and the servers are quick at replacing the used plates. Great bang for the buck !!"}
{"text":"I'll preface this review by saying that I'm not really a fan of Indian food in general. However, I really enjoyed my visit to Swagat! Service was fast, the place was clean and had a nice ambience, and the food was definitely above average.  It's a little on the \"nicer\" side, so don't be planning on spending less than $15 here. I would say that their food is well worth their prices, though! Their portions aren't THAT huge (although certainly enough to take home if you don't eat too much), which is uncommon for Indian restaurants, but it's definitely enough to fill you up.   I tried the Chicken Tikka Masala (not very adventurous, I know), and it was pretty delicious. My table also got some garlic naan, which was FANTASTIC. I also got a mango lassi, and Swagat's certainly didn't disappoint.  Overall, I had a very pleasant evening at Swagat and would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Solid Indian fair. Finally satisfied by authentic flavors. I also love the fact that they feature southern Indian specialties. If the dish names don't roll off of your tongue easily, don't worry, the very (very) friendly waiters will help you in recommending the good dishes.   Order dosa, especially if you don't know what it is. And don't forget to take a camera with you. It's a delicious southern Indian rice crepe with a neat presentation.   This place is on my \"to go back\" list for sure :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food in Madison, Wisconsin. The menu is extensive so it's impossible to any lover of Indian food NOT to find something. The food itself was spectacular. The vegetable uttapam was hot and crispy, and the chutneys which accompanied it were very flavorful. I loved the ambiance of Swagat as well as the service. Great little restaurant in a great little corner of Madison and hope to return and try more in the future."}
{"text":"Pathetic.. How would you feel if you go to a restaurant and are asked to hurry up in a very rude way- just because the people serving you have to call it a day.... my friends and family had a very bad experience... No matter how their food is, I am not interested."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago.  On our way back from Wisconsin Dells, we craved our home food and stopped at this amazing Indian restaurant in Madison.   The ambiance of the restaurant is very accommodating, with Indian music paling in the background. The serves are really good and a i top rating on cleanliness.  They have a big menu! From indo-china infused charters to mughlai/punjabi and even south Indian dishes.  We decided on going with the Non-Veg platter and Gobi Manchurian for the starters. The platter had fired fish, seekh kabab, chicken tikka and chicken pakora. All the items were really yummy and I can say the chicken tikka was the best tikka I have had till date.   For main course we ordered kadai panner, chicken tikka masala, dal makhni, portions of tandori roti and garlic naan. Basmati rice was on the house.   Dal Makhni and kadhai panner were very well cooked but I guess they missed a pich of spices. But the chicken tikka masala was mouth watering. One of the est chicken gravys I have had after Tandoor Char in Chicago.   Thumps up to the cooks at this place!  The overall experience was really good and all of the dishes that we ordered were cooked to perfection. I would definitely want to go back again!"}
{"text":"Well, color me impressed.   I feel like I drove to the end of time to meet a friend, I was concerned about it's strip-mall-y-ness, but at the end of the day, I left fulfilled and felt like I got some decent bang for my buck! In truth it was a little expensive, 11 bucks as compared to the 6 buck buffet near my house in Tucson, but I'm told city comparisons are a yelpeve ;) so omit that editorial if you're thinking about dining. There are PLENTY of vegetarian options, and because I'm always weirded out by buffet meat, I was thrilled to see chick pea and lentil a plenty! I found it odd that the garlic naan was on the buffet but they brought regular plain naan. Sort of wish those were switched. And the salad is totally pass-over-able (a word?) as was dessert. My lunch date loves the mango ice cream, I'm concerned that it's a color that doesn't actually exist normally in this world."}
{"text":"We stopped in for their Sunday lunch buffet. The crowd of cars at that end off the parking lot was the first clue that this restaurant would be good. There was a great diversity of dishes on the buffet. The food was fresh and delicious. As if that weren't enough, this place does not cheap out on the quality of the toilet paper in their restrooms. No single ply sand paper here! Just thick cushiony soft goodness. From end to end, Swagat provides a top notch experience. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The lamb mango is one of my favorite dishes ever. The service is great and the food is consistently excellent. I have never left disappointed."}
{"text":"I got mistaken for the host!!! Sorry ladies, I can't seat you. I was just being polite when I held the door open for you. #brownpeopleproblems  Swagat India offers a pretty decent lunch buffet with lots of meats and lots of desserts. No goat."}
{"text":"Eh. Not impressed at all. Given that I only came here for the lunch buffet, I'll allow it 3 stars. I will say that I am Indian and have grown up eating good Indian food, so maybe my standards are skewed. I can be a huge snob when it comes to Indian food. I rarely go out to eat it, but decided to come here after seeing so many good reviews for it on Yelp.  We came here for the lunch buffet ($11.95 on weekends, $9.95 on weekdays) on a weekend. The service was okayyy...kind of barely there but we were there for the buffet so I guess it didn't matter. The food was mediocre. Nothing was particularly flavorful or spicy. The chana masala was super runny, and the naan was drenched in butter. The chicken and goat pieces in the curries were not good cuts of meat. Typically you use a whole cut up chicken, but it looked like they just used boneless breast or thigh meat. This takes away a lot of flavor and the pieces don't absorb the sauce well. The goat was just all bone and fat. One of my favorite dishes is kadhai paneer, and theirs was so-so. Nice vegetables, not too overcooked, but just lacking in flavor and the paneer didn't taste very fresh. On the upside, the food wasn't super greasy and seemed better prepared than food at another Indian restaurant I've tried in Madison at a work lunch. Maybe the reviews for this place are so good because it's better than anything else in the area.  I wonder if maybe the buffet just isn't very good and it's better to come for dinner instead, but the dishes are really expensive for Indian food (~$12-15/plate, with an extra $2-3 for naan!). I've never paid that much for Indian food anywhere! It also worries me that they have North Indian and South Indian food on the menu. How are you supposed to know what to order? I've never been to a restaurant that can do both well.   If you're looking for good, authentic Indian food, maybe stay away from the buffet, but I can't tell you if it's any better for dinner."}
{"text":"Pretty darn fantastic! Lunch Buffet, great selection with all your Indian Classics along with some great apps & street foods!  Good service, great food, bargain.  Go, Becuz you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"North Indian food restaurant Nice ambience, good service Food is very tasty, - try naan, tandoori roti, chicken kadai, chicken tandoori and black lentil dal."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the waiter provided suggestions and the food he suggested was awesome. Very flavorful and the fish appetizer paired well with my Heineken as he said it would!  I will surely be back, next time I will be checking out the weekend lunch buffet. The waiter mentioned that on the weekends they have the best selection of deserts, pastries, and entrees and that would be the idea time to sample the many dishes they offer!"}
{"text":"I'm wracking my brain trying to understand the appeal of this restaurant.  I have visited twice, once for dinner, and once for the weekend buffet.  Both times I was disappointed by the lack of flavor, portions, and price.   At $15, the weekend buffet has a lot of vegetarian options, and not much for the meat lovers.  The chicken tikka masala tastes like chicken in tomato sauce, the paneer is short on paneer and long on sauce, and the naan, something they excel at with dinner, it missing from the buffet.     I have friends that swear by this place, so it's worth a visit, but if you don't care for the food, it might not be you.  BTW, can the staff stop standing by the dessert area like bouncers?"}
{"text":"The best Indian buffet in Madison, variety of selections on the buffet and very good quality food, clean and excellent ambiance, servers are friendly and very attentive. The goat curry is way to salty, some other dishes to.  Please go easy on the salt. Thank you."}
{"text":"Their lunch buffet is worth it. We got seated right away and were told to help ourselves...so naturally, we did :) We started with the appetizers.. There was chicken 65, masala dosa, pani purri, samosa, rasam and more. All of it was so good! Made me so happy that I could eat this Indian food that I haven't had in forever. There was so much to choose from for the main course-- garlic and regular naan, plain rice, biriyani, and so many curries. My favorite was definitely the chicken biriyani. And finally dessert, although there were many to choose from, I went with the classic mango ice cream, something I haven't had in forever. It was so good and creamy! I'd come back here for sure in the future. Pretty good Indian food, great service, and a decent price."}
{"text":"Swagat has become the 'go to' option for Indian food in Madison for my family and I. Their lunch buffet is very solid, making this a frequent destination of choice for a few of my colleagues and I as well. Let me say upfront that in a slightly more perfect world I'd love to give Swagat 4.5 stars, which I think is the perfect rating for them, but in the end I think the 4 star rating is the most fair and accurate option.   I'll start with the lunch buffet. Every time I've been in for lunch there have been a wide variety of very tasty options to choose from. There's always a curry of some sort, soups, desserts, appetizers, a salad, naan, a couple rice dishes, a couple veggie dishes, as well as chicken tikka masala and a single 'Chinese' dish. The variety is what really makes the lunch buffet an awesome option and I've always found at least one or two stand out options each time I've visited. If they have the chili pakora when you visit it's a MUST have (check the appetizers). These are delicious! The chicken tikka masala is probably the most consistent dish on the buffet and is always very good, although I do find that I need to add quite a bit of spice in one way or another. It makes sense to cook for a relatively mild midwest palate (especially as a buffet) and fortunately there's a really nice chutney and sauces bar to help perk things up a bit. The most unexpected element of the buffet is the single dish cooked in the style of Chinese food that seems to be present every time I go in. Not only is this unexpected at an Indian buffet, it's almost always REALLY tasty, so I guess on the whole that's a win. For me, the dishes that are not scared to be on the spicy side are almost always the best overall, but I've rarely had anything bad. Sometimes, but not always, the table is given a basket of hot fresh naan and there's always garlic naan as part of the buffet so that cornerstone is firmly in place. As a great friend of mine is very fond of saying it's the melange of flavors that really makes Swagat an excellent choice for lunch!   Outside of lunch I've order food to go from Swagat a number of times. Many of their made to order dishes never seem to show up on the buffet because they're EXCELLENT! Again, I understand the economics involved but dishes like the palak mushrooms and chicken vindaloo are SO good it would be awesome to catch them by luck from time to time. the take out option is great, but there's just nothing like enjoying a dish hot out of the kitchen and some dishes certainly travel better than others. My wife and our kids all have favorites from Swagat and they're prepared consistently well.   So, take home message, great food and very good service; but a bit light handed with the spice (and occasionally the seasoning). Lunch buffet is a very solid option, but dining in off the regular menu is probably the best if it'll work. If not, take out is another great option (and executed well) but some dishes certainly make the trip home more easily than others.   Thanks Swagat, you guys are great!"}
{"text":"First time here. We ordered the following: 1. Samosa chat: great taste and very filling.  2. Lamb vindaloo: big portion but I have to say that they cook on the sweet side. Even I ordered extra spicy, it was actually mild.  3. Tandoori Roti: it would be better if they did not finish it with the oily or buttery thing in top.  4. Mango Lassi: it was fine. It tasted like the one they sell by the bottle.   Good food but not spectacular. I think they are keeping a \"sweet & sour taste\" on all dishes  for their current clientele. It's a great version or westernized Indian food. It's tolerable but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"I have only been to Swagat for the lunch buffet. In my opinion, the lunch buffet is the best Indian buffet in town.  The foods are more flavorful than some of the other buffets with a good variety, and the foods tend to change more on a day to day basis than some other buffets. I'll go out of my way to go here if possible even though there's an Indian restaurant much closer to me.  The buffet is 7.95 on weekdays and 8.95 on weekends so it's a good deal!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend their lunch buffet! Can't miss any single curry dish. My favorite is the lamb curry, and they also have very good naan.  Once you know what curry you like, go to their dinner to have a full dish of it :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch buffet on 10/25/2025. The food was delicious and had many option for vegetarian (important because we prefer vegetarian). They had samosas, idly, uthappam, pakoda and PANI PURI - which was awesome for appetizers! For the main course the buffet had 2 types of naan, pongal, vegetable biryani, sambar, 4 different types of vegetarian curries. Had quite a selection of sweets too, loved the mango ice cream!"}
{"text":"It just doesn't get any better. The buffet is amazing, fresh, and varied; the mango lassis are great; and if I get carryout, there's not a better tikka masala sauce in existence. This place is the bee's knees f'sho."}
{"text":"Wow, that lunch buffet just hit the spot so good. And the mango ice cream. I could die happy."}
{"text":"Came for lunch but didn't want the buffet. Ordering off the menu pretty expensive. I used to live in Rogers Park in Chicago and Devon Avenue is full of Indian restaurants. Swagat wouldn't survive the area for the price vs quality argument but this isn't Chicago and for Madison it's good. Service was slow and they weren't packed."}
{"text":"Very diverse selection, and the staff is very friendly and on time with refills.  The buffet is a little pricey on the weekends, but the food is almost always fresh (just don't go right before they close, but that's the same with any buffet!) and delicious.  I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Had a really great experience today for their lunch buffet. The food was better than I remember it the last time we were here. It was super busy and staff was very friendly. There were more options of foods then I remember as well, several appetizers to choose from. They also refilled several items so everything was hot and fresh. I also noticed on the wall that they won Best in Madison, not sure for exactly what. Maybe best Indian food or Indian buffet? Either way this is a great Indian restaurant for a quick, delicious lunch."}
{"text":"Been to Swagat several times and have always walked out satisfied. #77 (MALAI KOFTA) is amazing. If you're a fan of spice make sure you order your dish VERY SPICY. It still may not be hot enough, so stress the spice. The service has always been attentive and quick as well. I avoid lunch buffets so I don't have anything to offer in that area. Made to order is always the way to go."}
{"text":"Swaggy P.  Where do I even begin.  This restaurant is amazing.  First, you need to go at lunch but that'll be obvious to you if you eat at Indian Restaurants as the buffet has a wide variety of dishes and like most it is inexpensive - $10.    That's not the reason to go to a restaurant though.  I'd pay $50 for this buffet, it's that good.  It blows Maharaja out of the water both with selection and taste and that's saying a lot as they are no slouch.  The service is friendly and the space is setup so that I personally feel more attended to than at Maharaja.  The na'an is great too.  Best dish?  That's like asking if you like the badgers or the packers better; it's all good.  The Tikka Marsala is probably tops though, and I love all the dough-wrapped entrees.  All the rice is scrumptious, and the curries are grade-A.  I'm overdoing it though, you just need to stop reading and drive there now.  On yeah and the fish is quite tasty; do not skip it.  Rivals Samba for my favorite restaurant in Madison, hope you like it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"On a recommendation, we went to Swagat for lunch.  The buffet was a bit smaller than Maharajah or Maharani but a lack of flavor it was not!  None of us left hungry that day.  Service was acceptable and the food was hot and plentiful.  We went for lunch on a Saturday.  We paid $14 a piece, Dinner prices.  I will come back next time for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"Nice lunch buffet! Well stocked with a variety of choices and reasonably priced. Quick seating by friendly staff.  Ended up eating the coconut soup for dessert.  Creamy and sweet - mmmm!!! Great hearty lunch option close to work."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet. Plenty of variety. Nice ambience. Keep it up."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 star.  Best in town for Indian cuisine. I have been visiting from last 2 years and never disappointed.!"}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service. Food seemed rotten. No cleanliness. No soaps in washroom. Wonder how waiters keep thr hands clean"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Some of the best Indian food I've had since my visit to India. Very reasonably priced and large portions. I strongly urge visit."}
