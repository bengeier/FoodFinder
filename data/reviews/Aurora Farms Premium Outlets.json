{"text":"This is an awesome outlet mall. It is the only one around that has a Nike outlet! It also has Coach too so the girls love that."}
{"text":"Had a great time yesterday at the outlet people were friendly and had great sales!!!! They had food trucks out there to curb my hunger and the coach store is awesome my wife loved it"}
{"text":"Factory stores are different from outlets. Outlets carry actual clothing once in a department store. Factory store make clothes that are lesser quality and were never intended to be put in the designers store. You are paying for a cheaper product."}
{"text":"My typically picky hubby and I went here yesterday we found him some Nike shoes and decent sunglasses, for me a coach bag n wallet! Happy day :) the staff at all the stores were AMAZING not one unfriendly person there. It was well worth the hour drive"}
{"text":"We love going there...whether to shop or feed the ducks. Best time to shop is Black Friday...the deals are off the charts!!!"}
{"text":"Its really time they close this place. The shops over charge for a lot of items unless they have a good sell and the food court consists of 3 restaurants which include subway and a lot of the stores are closing. I was kind of disappointed although I've been here a few times, but things just aren't the same."}
{"text":"I went to Aurora Farms with particular clothes, business casual for work, in mind and was nearly disappointed until I found Ann Taylor Loft.  They had many choices to choose from and all at reasonable prices.  I tried Banana Republic, while they had a lot of great deals, it was hard to find anything above a size 6.  The store that was most disappointing was Saks 5th Avenue.  I did not find a single decent deal there. The store was sloppy, clothes and shoes just kind of thrown about everywhere and the prices were ridiculously high.   I wish there had been a Lucky or some other decent store that sells good jeans other than Levi.  Just not a fan of Levis.  If you don't have any specific type of clothes to buy, you can probably find quite a bit of good stuff here, however when you have something in mind, makes it a little more difficult."}
{"text":"If it had a J. Crew Outlet it would get five stars... please :)   I have worked at half of the places here and have gotten some great deals. The people are nice and the parking lots are always full."}
{"text":"Easy-access mid-sized outlet shopping.  Not sure of the schizophrenic architecture at Aurora Farms; half the complex is a village-style collection of cottages around a koi and duck-stocked pond; the other half is a rectangular strip mall around a parking lot.  Which was the expansion?  Reasonable collection of the usual outlets, including Brooks Brothers, Under Armour, Le Creuset, etc.  Unfortunately, all were junior-sized versions of the outlets, with limited stock (no extra slim-fit dress shirts at BB!) compared to their larger outlet counterparts.  Avoid traffic; park in the village and avoid the rectangle."}
{"text":"I love Aurora Farms! It is so nice to walk around, feed the ducks, and shop at the stores. The addition of food trucks on the weekends just adds to the atmosphere. I will say- I wish there were some better stores such as Sephora, Victoria Secret, or Bath and Body Works. It is always clean and I enjoy stopping here. They have good discounts if you look. Having worked here, it was always a pleasure to be at Aurora Farms. The only downfall is parking. It can get busy, but there isn't much you can do for it."}
{"text":"This place is decent but as others have said the food court is a joke.  They try to make up for it with food trucks but for crying out loud get some better options for food.  The stores are pretty decent.  I like Brooks Brothers, Under Armor, and The North Face stores personally.  The Hanes store is great for getting new under garments pretty cheaply.  We go shopping here a few times a year."}
{"text":"Pretty much a standard outlet experience with better manicured grounds.  Cute little pond, Christmas lights, very walkable.  They have your standard, run-of-the-mill stores like Calvin Klein, Fossil, Coach, DKNY, kitchen appliance outlet, etc.    If you are a AAA member, stop by the information service desk and request a free coupon book."}
{"text":"Nike store is really good here. Most of the stores smell bad and are trying their hardest to cover up the mildew smell."}
{"text":"Seem large, I guess I'm lazy and like to park in front of the store I want.  But requires me to really walk to see other stores or keep moving my car?? sometimes hard to find stores (maybe better signage?)"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and we go here quite often. I try not to go on holidays or weekends because then you can barely walk around. The atmosphere is calming and relaxing. Some stores are cramp while others take the open layout.  This is a place where kids can feed ducks and tire themselves out. Love the workers attitudes and the fresh air here."}
{"text":"It's a great place to wander during the spring and summer.  There's a great variety of stores.    Typically when I hear the term \"outlet\" I think cheaper prices. At some stores the cheaper prices are evident(check the clearance racks) and great buys. Sometimes the stores have good sales.  But typically I find that the prices aren't that great it's just stuff that is going out of season."}
{"text":"Tip: Bring your AAA member card for additional 10-20% off discount on top of the existing deals! Never knew about this until I accidentally my AAA slipped from my wallet. Now it's great deal! Talking about extra 10% at North Face and extra 20% at Merrell!"}
{"text":"Decent Outlet,  I was in the area and had some time to killed so I stopped to check it out. Aurora Farms is broken into two pieces One section looks like something out of the Wild West. The other is just a Strip Mall. There is a small pond with ducks and geese that you can feed from the nearby duck food vending machines for a quarter. There is also a playground near the pond for the kiddies.  All of the standards are here, Coach, Nike, Polo, Adidas, Saks Off Fifth, Levi's and much more. The selection at most of the stores I visited was pretty good.  Decent food court area as well."}
{"text":"I was suggested that I shop here due to a tight budget that I am under. I am surprised that they still have this outlet store. Stereotypically, outlet shops do not exist in a state like Ohio and would be found in a state where there is a subway.   This place is good to go to if money for you is now a problem. If you like the type of clothes, wallets, and purses that are seen at Macy's but don't have enough money for it, this is the place to shop at."}
{"text":"Skip it!  Too many stores are gone, closed or just not truly outlets.  I save way more by shopping online.  The layout of this place would make anyone scratch their head - and the \"food court\" ha a pizza place & a subway - ummmm right.  Like I said SKIPPOLA!"}
{"text":"Wide selection of stores and quaint shops in the village outlets section. Very nice on spring and summer days with the pond and outdoor scenery. My mom and I enjoy coming here every summer and shopping and feeding the ducks. My only complaint is about the \"food court\". I would not really call it a food court, rather it is two eateries and a Hershey's ice cream shop. There is a pizza shop with pizza that is good but always sold out and a subway. I think it would be great if they expanded and got a couple more eateries in the food court or a restaurant somewhere in the outlets to go with the food court and ice cream shops."}
{"text":"I like shopping here but couple of store could get better customer service. I guess saying thank you for your purchase is not an option at Merrel/hush puppies outlet. Very rude service at Merrel/Hush puppies store. I live banana republic store, famous footwear offered great service and nice selection."}
{"text":"I seem to make it out here at least once a month but I sometimes ask myself why I go at all. I usually go for three reasons; polo, Adidas and Nike. Occasionally I make stops at Pacsun and under armor. I go to the outlets to find deals. Unfortunately Pacsun never has competing deals. Adidas, Nike and polo have them on the weekends.   Pros: it's a beautiful outlet mall. Wonderful for travelers. Great for families and people from out of town.   Cons: there isn't much selection and the deals just aren't there. It needs expansion. It needs a better food court."}
{"text":"One of the better outlets I've been to.  It's actually laid out well and fits into Aurora, so it doesn't become an eye sore like others I've been to.  A foot amount of stores with decent discounts at most of them (Banana Republic, Coach, Nike, Michael Kohrs, Levi's) and then you have some local shops as well.  Most tend to have clearance on top of their discountness.  Only downside is that it's not directly off a highway like other outlets are"}
{"text":"Like visiting a Westfield mall or a Tanger outlet mall. Plenty of parking a little on food choices"}
{"text":"I had a great time shopping with friends when we came here! There was plenty of parking (crucial) and it was super cute how some of the store buildings looked like miniature houses. My absolute favorite part though is the pond in the middle where you can feed the ducks and fish! They have these dispensers at various points around the pond where you can buy a handful of duck treats for $0.25! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the pond water was bright green and kinda milky. Weird. I'm not even sure how the fish could maneuver around in the water and know where they were. Also all but one of the dispensers needed to be refilled."}
{"text":"Not worth it.  Very high priced.  Everything costs more at Aurora Farms and it takes you 45 minutes to an hour to get there.  Most of the crap the stores have in them are last year's fashions. The return policies are very, very bad and the parking is not convenient. You are far better off just going shopping near your home where you will find the exact same items for less.   I have to say that Prime Outlets has done a good job of marketing the place.  They really make many people that go there think it is a good place. I mean just look at the reviews. The reviews are not accurate -- so please beware.  I have been going to Aurora Farms since 1980.  Back in the 80's it was an enormous flea market. It was one of the best flea markets anywhere.  It had several barns and a auction house and acres of outdoor flea market. There used to be a real Amish restaurant there.  Then someone got the idea to commercialize the place and put designer outlets.  A couple of the barns were kept for a short while and they continued the flea market and the auction house but eventually phased the stuff out and put more outlets. They ruined Aurora Farms."}
{"text":"We LOVED this place!  My husband had never been here until this weekend  and I haven't been here in at least 5 years - the crowds (parking) let us know that this was \"the place to shop\".    Highlights:  NIKE, and Harry and David (closed in Lodi but going strong here).  Lowlights:  Under Armor and Brooks Brothers.  I was happy to see that patrons could still purchase food out of feeding station machines to feed the ducks in the pond.  It was sort of romantic with all of the beautiful landscaping and benches interspersed throughout the mall.  We are already planning to return for before-school shopping and Christmas."}
{"text":"I love premium outlets.  It really is quality... at a discount. This place is just LOADED with great stores, a food court, playground and a huge variety of stores, not just clothes."}
{"text":"Great for swinging by for a quick outfit. Easy to get to with no traffic tie ups in the area. All your designer brands in one area with a few simple as well. Great for all types of buyers!"}
{"text":"This is the closest mall type thing to my house. That alone merits a star, as I live in a town where the local WalMart is the shopping mecca of the people. Secondly, there is a pond with waterfowl. As a person who loves animals and has many of these aforementioned waterfowl at home, this merits yet another star. Now onto the stores! Most of where I shop is located here, and there are some great deals every time I go! These cover the remaining two stars. My only gripe is when winter hits, and everyone reading this review knows of the horrible Northeast Ohio winters, this place is pure hell to walk through. Other then that. a solid four stars!"}
{"text":"Good experience at most stores. Super helpful employees who were happy to work there. Even got my husband turned on to Nike! Who knew!"}
{"text":"Nice middle-sized outlet mall.  My mom and I seem to hop to every other store. Some we are just not interested in but that means there is a good variety for other people.  I still head to the clearance section first of any place and most places have an ok selection though I find the \"sale\" prices on the main merchandise still high in some stores. Most have a lot of selection.  I can't imagine I would like coming here much in the winter though.    No where that great to eat on the grounds, so we have ventured into the community thanks to Yelp to find lunch.  Not too difficult to get to from the highways but I have only been here during the week so I can imagine it is busy on the weekends and holidays."}
{"text":"This place used to be the bees knees. Now, it looks more like the stinger. Talk about run down.....needs some serious reconstruction. The store offering here is equally as bad. The lake where the ducks are? One word... GROSS. The food court here is cheap and disgusting. Truthfully, they get 2 stars because they have a North Face and some yummy food trucks once a week. If I were you, I'd travel south a bit and hit the new Tanger outlets near Columbus."}
{"text":"Nice variety of stores for the home and whole family. No restaurants but there is a small food court with a subway etc. there is a little playground which is nice for parents with younger kids. It's the closest outlet mall to me so I don't mind it but it is definitely outdated compared to other outlet malls."}
{"text":"This is not only a great place to shop, but a great place to hang out and take the kids. There's this pond where you can feed ducks. There's food trucks and live entertainment on the weekends.  I get most of my work clothes at Van Heusen and casual clothes at the Banana Republic Factory outlet. One day, it was just too bright and it hurt my eyes, so went into Sunglass Hut and bought a pair of shades."}
{"text":"Good variety of options here.  They recently added American Eagle and Under Armour stores.  I always find some great items at great prices.  I love the Gap outlet store for sleepwear and cardigans.  I don't normally shop at Banana Republic, but I usually able to find some items for good prices.  The Coach store is always a zoo, but they carry a ton of stuff!  No trip to the outlets would be complete without stopping in Le Gourmet Chef for yummy dip samples."}
{"text":"This shopping location is a great place to go to when your in a hurry, although some of the employees are snooty but a great place to stroll with the kids go to Hush Puppies and the Old Navy and Osh kosh B'Gosh! Growing up in the area I have enjoye seeing it go from small corporate outlet with just the four corners building to now an added on large scale American Eagle, Cafe, Sunglasses Hut, and the merry go rounds! It is fun to feed the geese an watch passers by."}
{"text":"I love coming out here at least once a month.  All the name brand stores to shop at with good low prices.  I shopped for me and my hubby and got lots of good things for Christmas gifts as well."}
{"text":"Been going to this mail since the early 1990's. I have seen the changes that parallel changing tastes and changes in the economy. This is not on an interstate highway, so it draws primarily locals. It can be very congested at times, and difficult to find parking. Accessible parking is not well distributed. Also, look forward to dealing with aggressive type A shoppers, especially on the weekends. A better variety of stores would help as well."}
{"text":"Wow! Tried this place when kids were little and didn't like it.  Been going to Grove City instead for years.  Tried this today and will NEVER BE BACK! Old and rundown.  Yuk!"}
{"text":"Really liked Aurora outlets. Spent some time there returning clothes from Christmas. Very friendly stores, clean facilities, and friendly stores.   Deals were pretty decent as well. Recommend parking in the backlot it's near a lot of stores and there are many more spots than in the front."}
{"text":"Plenty of stores at Aurora Farms premium outlets and you can find majority of brand name stores. More importantly, there is something for everyone. The stuff ranges from clothes, toys, books, chocolate to entertainment system and housewares.   Love the outlet layout, it seems pretty spread out. Oh and you can feed the ducks because there is a pond. +1 for that. Typical food court like any other malls so not much to say there. Overall, Aurora Farms is certainly a great alternative to air-conditioned department stores. Would you get better deals than regular shopping malls? Not usually as it depends on when you visit the outlet."}
{"text":"Girls day out:: just shopping and hanging out. I haven't been to these outlets in years. There are a lot of good stores but it wasn't extremely busy the day we decided to go: We found a few good deals at the Skechers outlet and under armor. Wasn't really shopping for one specific thing so we hit all the stores. It was raining and a few of the stores must have a water leak issue so they didn't open up when we first got there. Over all it was ok for a day out."}
{"text":"Communication team needs to work with the city and post for customers alternative to get to the Outlet; especially on holidays when the Outlet is open and roads are closed for city parades."}
{"text":"No clothes for 20-something's. Mostly older women's fashions and baby clothes. Great for grandmas shopping for their grand kids I guess. Oh, and inner city Cleveland people steal from the stores all the time. I know because I worked at this outlet mall. Sheesh. The pond is cute!"}
{"text":"Amazing place o go shopping!  It's an outdoor outlet and has a variety of stores to shop from.  They have pretty good deals on certain items in which is forces people to look at the prices and calculate their discounts.  Some stores take military discount and online coupon codes so make sure to ask before you check out to get some extra savings.   During the vending it gets pretty dark in certain areas so I suggest you stay in the light just so you don't accidentally trip over some unleveled concrete.  There are plenty of parking spots in the front of the outlet and in he back.  During he holidays like Black Friday there are extremely good deals going on but parking becomes limited and it gets packed and crazy!  Prepare yourself for chaos if you come here during the holidays!"}
{"text":"We visited this outlet in the middle of a small snow storm. We had a few hours to kill and we had heard good things about this outlet. We entered the outlet next to the huge Polo store. You see that huge store and get excited but then you walk through a whole section of empty buildings. Buzzkill. We spent two hours walking around the stores. There were only a handful of shoppers because of the weather. While there was a variety of shops there were none that carried Plus Sizes (over size 16). My husband found a few things to buy but there was nothing to even look at for me. Big bummer.  There is a cute pond in the middle and a playground for kids. It's nice for most people-just not curvy girls."}
{"text":"The selection of stores are nice, but the layout of them leaves something to be desired...be prepared for a day of walking & searching during this outing.."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the Aurora Outlets have lost its charm. Given this isn't all their fault because of how high the online sales have become, but the stores have become sparce and it is always dirty. I used to love this place but after my last visit, I will not be returning because there just isn't much there to bring me back, except the Banana Republic Outlet which always has the best deals."}
{"text":"It's really small in comparison to others I've been to but it has the standard stores that will make the trip worth it.  I like to shop at Banana Republic so I'm A-OK with this place.  I did just come back from Birch Run in Michigan which is probably a 5 star.    One thing I wish Aurora Farms had was a couple unique lunch restaurants on premises besides the chow cart, pizza place, and Hersey's.  Man has to have his beer after 2-3 hours of shopping and maybe a glass of wine for the significant other.  It is nice on those sunny days though and the duck pond is pretty cool.    I have yet to visit all the stores but they do have a website where you can see if this place fits the bill.  If you are within 45 minutes of this place, make the drive, you'll have a good time, just do some research on places to eat around Aurora before you go."}
{"text":"Aurora Farms is a medium-sized outlet mall. I do wish there were a couple of other stores here (especially J Crew and Lucky) but the ones they have are definitely adequate. My favorites are Banana Republic, Under Armour and Brooks Brothers. Always good deals at BR for sure. There's plenty of parking in two large separate lots so be sure to check out the map to choose the lot closest to most of the stores you want to hit. Otherwise you'll be walking a little bit. There's a pond and a pretty big kids play area which is a definite bonus for taking a break.   The main thing that sucks about this place is that there are virtually NO food options. The 'food court' consists of a Subway, no-name pizza place, and a Hershey's Ice Cream shop. Not exactly what I would call a food court. When we were there the Donut Lab food cart was there which was awesome. Food trucks making a regular appearance would be absolutely killer! Seriously though there really needs to be some more food options especially given the fact that you are at least 25-30 minutes from any decent food options (far east Cleveland burbs or outskirts of Akron).   Overall a good bet to spend a few hours, but don't go hungry or make sure to bring a snack or picnic lunch."}
{"text":"One of the smaller outlet malls, but they do have stores that not all outlets have, such as Coach, Crocs, Off 5th Saks, and Michael Kors.  Has your usual staples like Carters, Gap, and Ann Taylor.  Entirely outdoors like plazas so not too fun in the winter, but definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"I end up coming here every time there are discount sales going on. The place has an old school feel to it unlike many modern outlets. There are stores that offer good discounts throughout the year."}
{"text":"2 star for the duck pond. Bring quarters to feed the duckies. (There's a duck food pebbles dispensary machine there.  Don't feed the ducks the quarters.)  1 star for both SAKS Fifth and Nike  Not to many stores. I recommend heading out there when the weather is nice. It's beautiful around the pond!"}
{"text":"My usual stops are Polo, Nike, Gap, Saks Off 5th, Brooks Brothers and Banana Republic. For the ladies, they have a Coach store. I still don't get that whole thing about women. They pay way too much money for a fabric container. I saw a girl at a bar with an Ohio license plate rolled up and capped with chrome ends for a purse and that really was cool to see. I am not a huge purse fan or anything. She  did get cool points and respect from me for originality and instead of seeing the same old sorry Coach, DB (Dave and Busters purse?) or MK (Mortal Kombat?) thingies slung around her neck. Anyhow, if you don't even want to buy anything, come to see the duck pond. It is always a real ruckus. Some of them don't get along and they are stuck at the same pond where the food source is so chaos ensues! I look at them damn ducks, and I see myself. I see the struggles of planet earth."}
{"text":"Love the stores.  Banana, Gap, Nine west, yankee candle, etc. this place is great esp with no mall close by."}
{"text":"This is a little far for me to travel to but I come here for specific places that have the best quality and lowest prices.  My favorite stores here are Le Gourmet Chef, Sketchers, Children's Place, Lane Bryant Outlet and BASS Shoes.  On a beautiful day, you can walk around in peace, feed ducks and geese and just have an overall good time.  There is even an outdoor playground for the kiddos.  Price range depends on what store you go too.  I put moderate to expensive because there is a Coach outlet and a Bose outlet that, even though cheaper than malls, is still pretty pricey."}
{"text":"They have done a good job with obtaining and retaining good stores here. There are few empty store fronts. The stores as a whole are up-kept well and in general I enjoy my experiences in them all. Large parking lots in various places so you can park in different places depending which stores you are aiming to visit. Grounds crews keep the place clean and well salted in the icy winters. My favourite stores are the Saks outlet, Banana Republic, and Polo. There are also quite a few sports clothing stores (Nike, UA, Adidas) which are nice."}
{"text":"Lodi Outlets have nothing on Aurora Farms Premium Outlets. The Clark's store there alone outdoes Lodi, who does not have a Clark's Outlet. Scenery is way nicer, better selection(besides Polo), all around better shopping experience in at least one mans opinion. All around more inviting staff, Lodi's kind of a ... Sluggish staff. It is a nice drive out there from my parts but saving money is a good thing. Again, in at least one mans opinion..."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed outlet shopping and I have to say this place has a different feel than one near a highway. There is a more personal touch and there are definitely more local shoppers. Most outlets are average at best.  I would rate this place just above average."}
