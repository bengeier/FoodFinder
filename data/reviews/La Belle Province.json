{"text":"Ick, Ick, Ick is all I really need to say. We stopped here for a quick fastfood dinner before a show down the street and boy was that a mistake. The food was terrible and worse the cook didn't even bother wearing gloves...He just flipped the burger on the bun with his dirty hands and then handed us our food."}
{"text":"La belle province is a great place to go to late at night!

Its open until god knows what time on the weekends?! The poutine is to DIE for, i simply cannot get sick of it! I heard that the burgers are really good also so you might want to check that out! BUT YOU NEED TO EAT A POUTINE FROM LA BELLE PROVINCE! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I ordered the corn beed sandwich with a side of poutine. For those who don't know what poutine is, it is fries with cheese curds with gravy on top. IT'S AMAZING!

The sandwich was delicious. I know I said I would never have corn beef again but I couldn't understand the girl since she was speaking in French. I pointed at the picture and asked for poutine on the side. 

Awesome combo!

Overall, I give it a corn beef high kick!"}
{"text":"Fantastique jusqu'à tout récemment! Portions généreuses, variétés, etc... Puis la flambée des prix! Non au capitalisme sauvage! J'y allais 3-4 fois par semaine. Fini. Des smoked meat à 14$... Sorry Tommy! Une fois par 2 semaines! Too bad!"}
{"text":"Always stop off here while in Montreal. Too bad they don't serve Poutine like this in Toronto, North York, Scarborough, etc....Terrific,  :P  Went in one early Saturday morning and the place was packed,  8O ! Hope to drop by again in March."}
{"text":"One of the best places to crumb for poutine, hamburger and other fast food. Great service with timely manner, great casual food, what more can it go wrong."}
{"text":"Oh salty yummy Poutine, how I miss thee...
You can't go to Montreal and not have Poutine! My friend suggested I try the Poutine at La Belle Province. He warned me it was nothing fancy, \"It's a grease joint\". I up for a little grease once in awhile. We ordered up a small Poutine. It looked delicious and smelled amazing. I had the honour of digging in first - the gravy was so tasty and the cheese all owey gooey on those rustic cut french fries....YUM! I got through only about a 1/4 of it and had to wash it down with my Coke. This is certainly not something I could eat all the time but man was it good! I'll have to go run a few miles to burn it off as I'm sure I gained an extra pound that day!

I have to agree with my friend that diners have the best poutine! Give it shot you won't be disappointed. Just remember to take it real slow!! :)"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I hade a half chicken with the new sauce and it was the best meal i had eaten all week."}
{"text":"The best artery clogging poutine in the world! Not to mention awesome steamed hotdogs!"}
{"text":"Bof, j'ai eu des meilleures poutines que ca... La serveuse, une bonne femme qui fait ca depuis 30 ans, me dit que la sauce est faite maison mais qu'elle ne sait pas ce qu'il y a dedans; HA trop comique celle-la.

I wanted to make my American boyfriend try the popular fast food they eat where I come from. The idea was to bring him to La Pataterie Hulloise to try the French Quebec culinary cuisine, poutine: five star grease to clog your arteries! But we were at Atwater market in MTL and this was the only place around serving the junk. It was fine, however I recommend the little  mom & paps shabby shacks with grease all over the walls coz you get the real deal ;)"}
{"text":"Got a delicious trio of deliciously fizzy medium-sized fountain pop (Pepsi), poutine the size of my head (upgrade from fries to poutine was $3 extra & OH SO WORTH IT), plus a delicious smoked meat sandwich that my sister & I fell in love at first bite with. I can totally see why this place was around since the 70s. Almost $17 after taxes, but very well spent."}
{"text":"It's greasy fast food... large portions... Good for a fast fat fix... but everything just tastes greasy really. So if you're looking for that sort of food this will do, but, if you're looking for taste and stuff.. this is not the place."}
{"text":"Ordered a giro. Watched the cook use his bare hands to handle raw chicken before putting together my wrap. He wiped his hands on his apron, did not wash them and then proceeded to put the toppings on my order. I couldn't believe what I saw. I told the owner and got my money back. Came close to being food poisoned tonight. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Really cute cafe/diner which serves up American and French style breakfasts and lunches. Located on Peel street, where a big Metro station is located, this place really does a great business. The prices are extraordinarily cheap. Coffee isn't too strong. I love the decor of this place, interpreting the old American diner's colors and ambiance. Service, you can't call it slow when one or two waitresses do every table in the restaurant. I commend them, but I feel it's necessarily to have more waitstaff. We all got fresh fruit to start, which consisted of bananas, melon, pineapple, etc... The pancakes were in the middle of pancakes (fluffy) and crêpes (flat), but the were really good. The #3, which was eggs, toast, bacon, and home fries, was really delicious. The eggs, scrambled, had great texture and taste. The toast wasn't drenched in butter. The home fries were a bit bland. We also got another dish that was the same thing, but instead of bacon, you had smoked meat. Really, really good. I would love to come back to this chain when in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Premièrement, juste le fait qu'on ne peut pas payer par carte, c'est poche parce qu'on doit payer des frais au guichet du restaurant.  Pour la nourriture, j'étais super satisfaite. J'adore la poutine de la belle province... Elle est salée et fromagée comme je l'aime! Ce que j'ai le moins aimé de ce commerce sur wellington, c'est le service à clientèle. Je l'ai trouvé médiocre; la caissière avait l'air de détester son travail et à cause de ça, mon copain et moi ne nous sentions pas les bienvenus et ça nous a donné envie de ne jamais revenir dans cette succursale. Ça se peut que ce soit juste la caissière le problème, elle a peut-être quitté son poste parce que ça fait des mois que c'est arrivé, si ce n'est pas un an. Mais ça m'avait vraiment marqué et j'espère que le service à la clientèle s'est amélioré d'ici là..."}
{"text":"Fries were delicious. Cheese was ok. First time I ate pouting. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Processed fries nowhere near Belle Pro standards.  I specifically walked to Belle Pro to get some good fresh cut fries but the generic processed fries served here are not up to any of the chain standards."}
{"text":"A chain though La Belle Province may be, they're a good spot for a late night fix.  Portions are generous enough, though the price is a bit higher than some may like out of a restaurant where the big and greasy are king."}
{"text":"The burger and the Fries are awesome, pouting sauce is good. Love the hot dogs too. And it's  cheap."}
{"text":"Make sure your vaccinations are up to date if you eat here. 
The cooks are extremely hands on, as though utensils don't exist. 
Even your poutine will be palmed a couple times during assembly. Non merci."}
{"text":"Service was friendly with a cheerful waitress. This place only took cash with a neato stuffed fish dispenser by the door. Eggs were perfect and the greasy potatoes really settled my american stomach. It felt like home with the creamy sausage and the weird smells. Fruit plate was a good start to the meal and the array of diner style food was nice. My lunch sandwich was perfect and so tall it was held together by long toothpicks. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"inexpensive but good.  Fruit is much smaller than the pictures.  A slice of tomato, slice of orange, slice if mellon, unripe slice if kiwi that that could not be eaten.  Coffee is weak but includes refills.  Potatoes were good.  Lots of bacon.  Sausage was good.  Ham was two cold cut slices."}
{"text":"Vrais vrais poutine!"}
{"text":"On ne s'attend pas à de la grande gastronomie, on est à la Belle Province! MAIS le proprio qui crie incessamment après tous les employés, voilà un comportement tyrannique qui ne mérite même pas d'étoile!!! Et hurler un \"fuck\" alors qu'il y avait quelques enfants sur place... Bravo champion!"}
{"text":"Gross!  

This place makes White Castle gourmet in comparison!  I know this is crappy fast food, which I love and embrace brokenheartedly, but place is total crap. 

There is a reason that homeless come here to eat, its totally cheap and open all night.  But I honestly feel bad for them!!!  

Their hotdog tasted like something that came out of the sewer.  It was soft and gooey, not the way a hotdog should taste.  Believe me, I'm a real New Yorker and know a dirty water dog - this was just dirty and gross.

If you have NOTHING else, sure I guess this place is fine for a late night snack when you're too drunk to find something else.  But it'll end up giving you a worse hang over than if you ate nothing."}
{"text":"Je sers mieux mon chien quand je lui donne sa gamelle. Frites posées sur le plateau 5 minutes avant le Burger. Burger d'ailleurs dégueulasse . Rien à rajouter"}
{"text":"I have only ever tried the poutine here. It is decent enough and the portions are more than enough to share with someone.  They offer one of the only vegetarian poutines in the city so it is worthy a try if you are vegetarian. 

This palce is a chain and has many locations across the city and offers typical dinner foods."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Fremont Queen Elizabeth a few blocks over, and I had no idea about where to grab a quick dinner...also, I'm weird about dining alone so I wanted something to bring back to my hotel room.  I checked the Yelp app for something quick nearby and this place struck my fancy, it also gave me the opportunity to grab poutine during my visit here as it's not on most menus in the states.  This place wasn't crowded for dinner, I got my hot dog & poutine to go...the staff here were super friendly and I was on my way.  The cheese curds were the perfect squeeky kind, though It was just way too much for just me so needless to say, I TRIED it...and that's that.
Good value here and worth checking out!"}
{"text":"If you want to get the worst food poisoning ever imagined then I recommend this place in a heartbeat! Several days ago bought a family size poutine for takeout. The next day got so sick I couldn't eat anything, had fever, had massive stomach and chest pains, and shortness of breath. Near end of day finally managed to puke this out of me and feel slightly better. Took me and my wife 2+ days to fully recuperate from this experience. I usually hate vomiting, last time I had to puke was 20+ years ago so you can tell this one was a bad one. And we know for sure its the poutine because its the only thing me and my wife and no one else ate right before (and you could tell from what came out of us lol). 

This really sucks because I used to go to this place often when I was younger, I feel lately they have lost their touch and as you can see it got to the point of making people ill :("}
{"text":"1st things 1st, when going to this location of LBP the 2 things that need to be eaten are: Smoke Meat, it's moist, and tasty, without being to fatty & the Poutine!
The gravy is salty, the cheese is squeaky, and the fries are rustic cut. 
I know the US yelpers aren't use to some of this delicious grease but when you have lived here your whole life this dish is like a warm hug!
A greasy, dirty hug! LOL"}
{"text":"Best service and best quality, you can taste the difference!!! The chicken and zatsiki are delicious!!! Must try!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place because we wanted to try the poutine. We tried the medium potuine ($6.81).This place is located inside the Centre Eaton food court. The poutine here was just alright, nothing special, far from being the best. If you're happen to be in the Centre Eaton, this place is worth checking out but definitely not worth going out of your way just for this."}
{"text":"Another La Belle Province (this one IS part of the chain, not all are). 

Typical La Belle Pronvince junk. hotdogs are okay, and the buns are from the IGA right across the street. 

The poutine is a dissapointment. Orange-ish commercial mix, refrifrirated cheese curds, and thick unevenly cooked fries. I left frustrated. 

Visitors: PLEASE do not make this your first Poutine.

Extra star for making the design of this particular location a mix of a 50s diner and a space shuttle."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: expect grease. Lots of grease. 
But if you're young, foolish, and have some arteries to clog, by all means. 

La Belle Province is basically a glorified chipstand that's indoors and looks like a 50s spaceship. They serve hotdogs, burgers, fries and the like.

Greasy, tasty and fast. Quality? Who cares. Its delicious. If you're into the whole 'lets shovel some flavour into my face and die later' mentality, this place is for you."}
{"text":"La \"Belle\" Province was not at her most glamorous today.  

The food is pretty standard of your typical breakfast fare except the toast was smothered in butter.   There really is no point in getting whole wheat toast for the added nutritional benefits with the vats of butter canceling out, if not, bringing you back into the negatives.

The decor is very retro 50s with booth seats.  The place reminded me of a dive bar minus the amazing food!  This particular Belle Province was less like the others that I walked past (e.g. commercial chain restaurant), and more of a mom and pop shop.  

I ordered 2 eggs with homefries and smoked meat.  The smoked meat was nothing special, but then again I've been spoiled with the likes of Schwartz's and its hard for anyone to live up to that reputation.  The eggs were over easy as I requested, and the potatoes were fine.  

If you're looking for your normal greasy spoon breakfast, La Belle Province is the place to go.  Maybe I'm a brekkie-snob, but it just didn't do it for me :p"}
{"text":"We went in for breakfast and weren't expecting much, since it's just a greasy french fry place.
Breakfast was totally passable - he had the breakfast croissant (eggs, ham, swiss cheese), I had the Philly wrap (little bits of minute steak, omelet, swiss cheese) - both were just fine.    Breakfast potatoes are pretty good, beans are terrible, table service was wonderful (like being served by your mom, which is never a bad thing)."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Franch Canadian Fast Food. 

Le Belle Province draws me in for it's variety of fast food. 

Hot Dogs- Check
Burgers- Check
Poutine of all types- Check Check
Hamburger Steak- Check
Frites- Err I mean French Fries
Club Sandwiches
Smoked Meat -YUM! 

When I come here I feel like I finally arrived in Quebec! I love the quirky menu such as the \"Hot Dog Michigan\" which is actually a chili dog. 
Who the hell knew?
Cheap and fast, it is a inexpensive place to grab a snack or bite on the run.
Now over 125 locations all over Quebec."}
{"text":"Great 50's diner decor (but not actually installed in the 50's).  My wife ordered the number 3 with sausage, eggs, potatoes and toast.  I ordered the number 6 with eggs, potatoes, bacon (5 pieces of \"American\" bacon - $2 extra), 2 pieces of French toast and, for some reason, regular toast.  Both also were listed as accompanied by fruit.
We first received a plate containing a slice of watermelon, a slice of pineapple, a 3/4\" thick slice of orange and a slice of tomato - I had forgotten that tomato is a fruit.  At any rate, they were all delicious, the perfect setup for what was to come.
We both had scrambled eggs which were perfectly fluffy, neither too dry nor too wet.  My bacon was perfectly cooked and delicious.  The potatoes were so good that I finished them all, something that does not usually happen.  The French toast was delicious.  I'm not sure what kind of bread it was but the eggs were mixed with vanilla and the resulting toast was sprinkled with powdered sugar.  The toast came neither too light nor too dark, buttered, but not overly so, although butter was provided should we wish to add more.  And, to top it all off, all of the food arrived at the proper temperature - even the toast.
We arrived at about 10:00 AM and there was only one waitress on duty with about 25 customers, but she did an amazing job and the owner helped bus the tables.
Prices were very reasonable, but they only accept cash.
The coffee was acceptable, but could be stronger.
We will be in Montreal for two more days and we plan to have breakfast here both days.
A very definite YES for our return trips."}
{"text":"Fucking killer. Best poutine, great burgers and steamies. Cock rings in the downstairs bathrooms AND a pay phone? SHIT IS ON LOCKDOWN."}
{"text":"If you are here visiting Quebec don't expect this restaurant to be the best, it's  the kind of place that low lives like to frequent. Drunks after partying in the middle of the day type of crowd...
Just the look of the front entrance should turn off most customers with half a brain.
BTW, they are looking for a serveuse (specifically a girl), beware because the two sub humans working there on Friday night at 7pm had as much charm and kindness as you would find from a serial killer on death row (and I'm  being kind).

I've always been repulsed by this kind of establishment that caters to the Hot dog and fries crowd. The staff here always seem like they all hate their jobs.

What a dirty restaurant from the outside all the way to their counter and those two jerks that \"served\" me tonight.
7pm Friday night with 2 customers eating at a table, here I am ordering a poutine that they make in about 15 seconds with a bunch of stale and undercooked fries that have been lying there for who knows how long. I ask them if they could put extra sauce and they both started complaining in a foreign language...
I don't know who let these two run this business but they will run it to the ground with such horrible attitudes.

They can't even hand me the receipt, they just throw it in a box and I have to find it myself!?

How can a restaurant with such low standards still exist?!

I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.
If no stars was possible that's  what  they would get.

SHUT IT DOWN!!!"}
{"text":"Made to order fast food in downtown Montreal serving the white and blue collar work force.  I had a burger and poutine, expecting them to slab an unknown piece of meat between buns.  I was surprised when they actually cooked it, it was served fresh than slabbed between button and with ketchup and mustard.  The poutine was suppose to be really good but I thought it was mediocre, gravy was good but I didn't think the curds was that fresh.  

I would have tried it again but the price was kind of high for what it was.  Late night drunk food, yes."}
{"text":"The staff were very welcoming, made a killer poutine that tasted good even the day after and pointed us in the right direction for alcohol."}
{"text":"Oh my god; the Poutine was cold and just disgusting and the hotdog was not great either.  The cheese also was playing on its own within the dish. Do not go here - tastes very differently versus other la belle province franchises."}
{"text":"Not the best Belle Pro. Location. I prefer the next one on sources. it is open 24 hours and seems to be a lot more fresh."}
{"text":"Going to Montreal i was told by a former montreal local that I had to go to BP for a poutine. I don't like poutine, but I had to try it there.

A fast food place, this place has all the bad for you foods you may require. I ordered up a plate of poutine and eagerly awaited its readiness. When they called up my order I happily dug in, and I must say that was some fine poutine!  

My best suggestion for those with small appetite and/or low tolerance to greasy food is to share, I hardly made it through a quarter of mine, and my friend only managed to eat half of hers.

Dang, now I have to go back for more..."}
{"text":"When you get sick the same nite... That's not a good sign. I would avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"I Parked next to one of the many signs warning that non-customers will be towed.  I went in and ordered a hot dog and fries to go, but  instead of driving off -- as was expected of me-- I decided to check out the cool looking Falafal joint across the street.   One thing led to another and before I knew it I was scarfing down one of the tastiest tahina's I've ever had.
Somewhere between my fifth and sixth chick pea ball, a tow truck appeared in  La Belle Province's lot.   With humus dripping down my face I ran towards my car hoping to avert disaster.    The owner of La Belle Province stood there, madly waving his arms and yelling at me in Mandarin.  Thinking quickly, I tore open my grease saturated  take-out bag and showed him the steamie I had purchased only 10 minutes earlier.    He looked at the hot dog, and then at me.   I don't speak Mandarin, but I could tell by the veins throbbing in his sweat coated forehead that he wanted me and my take-out  gone without further delay.   On the drive home, while plotting an elaborate revenge scheme, I was suddenly overcome by a rare sense of well being and comfort.   The wonderful aroma of frites was filling the interior of the car.    I began eating  again and let me tell you, even though the Falafal from Falafal St. Jacques was out of this world,  La Belle Province was to die for."}
{"text":"Consistently half decent! This doesn't mean much when reviewing a belle province, but it really does get a passing grade."}
{"text":"Cash only. Nice little joint in the downtown core. Tried out their cheeseburger and poutine. Cheeseburger was okay and poutine wasnt as I anticpated. Something about their poutine was making it sort of sweet.. almost like a bbq base, the portion size of the poutine is pretty good. Overall, I wasnt a big fan of the poutine"}
{"text":"Très mauvais fast food côté rapport qualité/prix j'ai été déçu en voyant les prix beaucoup trop cher par rapport à ce que l'on te sert , appart les hot dog 79cent qui en vaut la peine sinon ça en vaut pas vraiment la peine d'y aller malgré qu'à l'interieur c'est très beau , ça devrai l'être aussi pour leur plat malheureusement"}
{"text":"So this was the first food stop in montreal last weekend. We were told by a man who clearly knew we had no clue where we were going to go here. I also was told aby a couple people to check this spot out. My overall thoughts: It was ok. The Burgers were these little shniders pattys so i already knew what they would taste like. They tasted like little schniders pattys lol. The poutine was better. These places seem to be prominent in montreal but they arent as amazing as they look. I would go back for late night drunk eats but not my first choice for good cooked food."}
{"text":"There are many Belle Provinces in the Montreal / Laval region. In fact, I have 3 of them within a 2 km radius from my house. Yet, this one in particular plays the part of a fairy tale.

The key words are : \"just right\" 

The poutine sauce is \"just right\". The meat sauce is \"just right\". The hamburgers, the hot dogs, the fries are \"just right\".

This is special since many Bell Provinces and the variety of the namesake consistently fail in providing delicious food, on a CONSISTENT basis.

The service is lightning fast and amicable and the prices are extremely affordable."}
{"text":"Ok so i'm going to  go ahead and say that I don't see how Montreal has the best poutine...Yeah, it's their drunken invention but I've had better poutine in Toronto. That being said, this cute little place is just adorable. Diner style layout, with an old school over the counter menu. No I could not read it but the lovely staff helped me out. They were all super super nice. I got $5, a smoked meat sandwich and a poutine. They told me I couldn't finish it...But I did one better, finished it, went to a wedding reception and ate them out of business too. So SUCKKK IIITTT, Montreal.

Poutine was good but the gravy too light and watery. Actual fries were to die for though, crispy  on the outside and so soft and fluffy on the inside. PROPS.

Sandwich was tiiinnyyy tiny tiny, some mustard on it, but the meat was spectacular. I bit into it and had an unnoticeable coma/heart stop thing? 

Yums and a half, even though I was expecting mind blowing poutine."}
{"text":"La Belle Province serves up Montreal style fast food which includes such exotic menu items like Pogo sticks and, of course, smoke meat. Front and center is the Montreal \"steamie\" or \"steamé\". It's a small hot dog on a top sliced bun. Both dog and bun are steam cooked. One can order it \"all dressed\" or \"au Michigan\" (a hot dog with spaghetti meat sauce poured all over it). All dressed means it comes topped with onions, mustard, and chopped cabbage. It runs you a buck a dog.

Service is friendly, but if staff detects you're from out of town, you may be required to genuflect before their little Habs shrine. (And it took every ounce of strength to resist quipping I had money on Pittsburgh.) 

La Belle Province is a great, no-nonsense fast food joint full of cheap menu items. It's the Montreal version of Jack in the Box. Wish we had one in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great value. Huge portions! We got a classique poutine each ($7), with hot dog on top (an extra $2.50), with a small soda each. It came to $26. 

I was so full by the end that it's 8.30pm (we ate at about 12pm) and I'm still not hungry yet. 

Best tasting cheese curds I've tried yet!"}
{"text":"Bad joke time, yay! I've been waiting to get this one off my chest since I thought of it while sitting in the restaurant:

What does the interior and ambiance of this La Belle Province have in common with the captain in a submarine movie?

They both scream, \"Dive! Dive! Dive!\"

AHHH it's horrible but I love it!  Sorry.  Truly though, while I don't mind trying a place that looks a little questionable, I have to say that when I walked in here and saw the rather grimy look and the menu board straight out of the 70's with horrible-looking pictures of hot dogs on it, I almost turned around. This was not the meal I was craving.

But I needed to eat something, and I didn't have a backup plan after my first choice restaurant had closed for the day, so I sat down.  The waitress was friendly and the food (a smoked meat club with fries) came out reasonably quickly.  It was far from a memorable meal, but it did the trick. With a number of four-star ratings under its belt here on Yelp, I imagine this is not the dish they're known for."}
{"text":"LBP is normally a solid 3-star establishment; you don't come expecting anything exceptional. I've been to some slightly better than the norm (Jean-Talon & St. André) and some slightly worse (that truly nasty one on St-Laurent and Prince-Arthur comes to mind). This one does nothing to either improve or worsen its default rating. It's just sort of there, ready to save your life when you're hammered, and it's certainly got better poutine than the Harvey's down the street."}
{"text":"Poutine was pretty good, complete with actually squeaky cheese curds, but the absurdly over-salted gravy brings them down a star. Service was okay."}
{"text":"Fast food done right. These guys have one of my favorite poutines. Love there all dress dogs Quebecois style with pickled cabbage, relish, onions and mustard. The Michigan dog always cracks me up, being from Michigan i can tell you i have never seen anything like it. The meat sauce as they call it, as opposed to our chilli is different. It's sweet meaty and has carrots and other veggies in it. Almost like a stew"}
{"text":"I went to Montreal for a work conference, and I was demanded by my sister to try the Poutine in Montreal. I decided to go to La Belle Province as it was recommended by some people I attended the conference with. So once I stepped in the shop I automatically thought Olden Diner Style. (I just thought of Oppan Gangnam Style... Ehhhh Sexy Lady) Teehee!! Anyways back to the review. I ordered the Poutine and took it to the table. It was love at first bite, the Cheese Curds with that Hot Gravy on top of all of the succulent fries, perfectly incorporated to create the perfect bite. It was a large portion, but it better be if its 6 bucks for a Poutine. Montreal (La Belle Province) is definitely a great place to get your Poutine fix, its much better than the imitation Poutines with Mozzarella. Get your French on and manger la poutine."}
{"text":"5 star fast service, fresh food. Breakfast eggs bacon and best home fries in province! Delicious baked beens. Poutine  best in town because the fries are made fresh. Chicken yero tasty. 
Definitely will return again and again. Staff friendly!  Price is good. Great place to take my kids. Many variety of food offered at a low price."}
{"text":"Eek me thinks not is right!   

Having been in Montreal for a few weeks i was blown away by how often someone randomly urged us to try poutine as if it was God's grandmothers fresh baked apple pie or something.   We'd tried it at the burger king, but after two bites we returned it.  Everyone insisted that was no way to try poutine and we needed to go somewhere legit. like LBP's.   so, we trekked through the rain for a plate of the italianne and boy where we disappointed.   No one told us that you had to be shit faced to like it.  But when have you ever seen a shit faced  picky eater??  Never.     I'll try some fancy poutine next time at Banquise or whatever, but unless i'm wasted, this is just gravy slop on shitty fries."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times (roughly 4 times) since my friend mentioned it to me and I really like Italian Poutines and I work relatively close by.

Previously I would have ranked them as 4 stars but after today's visit, I wasn't sure whether to give them 1 star or 2 stars (reduce their 4 stars which I was planning on giving them for my earlier visits to 2 stars). I decided to give them 1 star.

For my previous visits, I didn't have this issue (there was a lady manning the cash register those times) but today during my visit, I ordered my usual large Italian Poutine and this time I asked to have smoke meat on top of it for an additional ~$3+tax extra. The person today told me how much it costs (I wasn't paying too much attention) and when I went to pay with my credit card, he self-tipped himself ~25% and passed the credit card pad to me. So when I tapped my card on the machine, I got charged the cost of the item with a 25% \"tip\" on top of that which he selected. He also didn't give me the credit card receipt to hide the fact that he did this.

Normally unless I sit down and they give me the food to my table (or it is a buffet), I will rarely tip (except when paying cash and when I have loose change at these types of places). I feel that it is similar to tipping at a McDonald's or any other fast food place where I order at the counter, pay for the meal right away, they make my order and put it on the tray while I wait and then I take my tray to an empty table and eat.

For my visit today, after being told the price, I wasn't really paying much attention as I mentioned when the guy at the cash mentioned how much it costs since I was speaking with a co-worker. I saw a value on the credit card pad when he handed it to me so I tapped my credit card on their credit card machine pad. After I finished my meal, I took a look at the receipt from the cash register (which is a different receipt from the credit card machine receipt) and saw the itemized cost of everything. Looking at the charge on my credit card online when I got back to work, I noticed that I was charged ~25% higher on my credit card. As far as I could tell, the tip buttons went 15%, 20%, 25%, and $ where I normally tap $ and then hit the green button for no tip and the guy pushed the 25% button before handing me the credit card pad.

My itemized bill showed a cost of ~$16.50 (large Italian poutine with smoke meat on top along with a large drink) yet my online credit card showed a charge of ~$20.50!

IF YOU PAY BY CREDIT CARD AT THIS PLACE, YOU SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL OF WHAT THEY MIGHT TRY TO PULL ON YOU!

Other than that, the Italian smoke meat was very good (which explains my previous visits to this place). I wasn't crazy about the smoke meat used there. They did put quite a bit of smoke meat on top my my Italian Poutine but I just prefer a different type of flavour or type of smoke meat (their smoke meat was \"wet\" whereas I prefer the drier Schwartz's type smoke meat)"}
{"text":"Nice owners, double layered poutine and quick delivery.
Only downside for me is their breakfast, the potatoes definitely need an upgrade. 
If their breakfast potatoes were grated or grilled potatoes I would be here way too often. 
However this is technically the 2nd place of the 5 eateries in the area."}
{"text":"Their subs are good, I usually get the regular which includes (steak, pepperoni & mushroom) & all the garnish. You can choose to remove an item if you don't like it. I also like their hot-dogs \" a la vapeur \" ( all dressed). They also have a lot of other options available on their menu. The fries/poutine are not that good so I avoid them. The only downside is that this place seems like it hasn't been renovated for awhile. Perfect for take-out."}
{"text":"Located inside the Eaton Centre food court, I wanted to try the famous Montreal hot dog. I originally wanted to go to Décarie, however due to time constraints I had to stick to La Belle Province.

Nothing was bad about the food, but absolutely nothing special about it as well. The hot dogs are more expensive than others, as I'm used to the 79 cent hot dogs at Alfa or $1.50 or so at Décarie...

For food court quality, this place isn't bad. However there's definitely better out there, and considering how hot dogs in Montréal are so cheap, do consider looking beyond chain restaurants."}
{"text":"we got a large poutine, a soda, and 4 steamies. tasted amazing and their poutine tastes better than most of the fancy schmancy poutine places in montreal. fries were not hard, and the gravy had awesome flavour. the steamies were so fresh and hot as well. yummmyyyy"}
{"text":"I won't eat anything else besides the spaghetti on the menu as it is vastly unhealthy and probably tastes like grime or at least feels that way in your gut after you've eaten it. I don't care what good things other reviewers have said about the food. Since I didn't want to walk around for a million years to look for food I decided to stop in here. As mentioned before, I ordered the spaghetti since everything else looks like it would give me a heart-attack in my sleep (not saying the spaghetti was whole-grain or organic). While the pasta is a bit overcooked but still edible, they DROWNED it in meat sauce...if only I had known..it was just this big red sopping plate in front of me. I ate it, but the sauce was watery in places which means that they didn't cook it properly or didn't drain enough water from the pasta when it was cooked."}
{"text":"Horrible service, very rude never returning! I called to find out about prices, I was told \"doesn't have time to quote prices\". So I called Delicia on Samson, they were more than happy to quote price and their food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't review a chain but this needs to be said.

You need to understand something about La Belle Province; it's a franchised restaurant chain. The chain is owned by Greeks and they sell franchises only to other Greeks. If a non-greek wants a franchise he can purchase it, but the price is likely to be tenfold. Furthermore, once LBP to another the menu can change a little, there are no standards followed so from one LBP to another, quality, product and experience can vary. It can suck or be awesome or anything in between.

This La Belle Province is not owned by Greeks. This La Belle Province is franchise that just doesn't care. You see they managed to get a counter space in Québec's largest food court, in the basement of the Eaton's Center in downtown Montreal. Just having this location guarantees a franchise owner the right to print money.

The owners are obviously in it for the easy money because the food is fucking horrible. Yeah they fucked up hot-dogs, burger and fries.

I went with a friend for a quick meal after work. She had Combo #2, which is 2 dogs, a poutine and a soft drink. I had the cheeseburger combo, with a poutine and a soft drink.

It was during the supper-time rush. My burger patty was a pre-cooked patty warmed over rapidly on the grill; the bun was not toasted, grilled or even steamed. How warm was my burger? By the time I was seated with my tray, the cheese was still cold and un-melted. The slaw had a weird taste. The poutine, a staple food for any self-respecting Québecois, was somewhat warm and tasted bland. The 7up was warm and tasted metallic.

But here's the kicker...

My friend had some dogs remember? Well first of all the buns were not steamed. When I order steamers, I want steamed buns. But then it gets worse... much, much worse. For some reason, my friend's dog flipped over to expose MOLD, FUCKING MOLD on the buns...

So you know it, STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT. They don't care about quality, service, their clients, they only care about their profit margin."}
{"text":"Not much to say about La Belle Province. Some are horrible, others are pretty damn good and the one in my hood is one of the good ones. Good burgers and good fries."}
{"text":"Thanks to Montreal Promos, I got a $25 gift certificate to La Belle Province, and luckily for me, the gift card was being held at this location.  I've eaten at Belle Pro's numerous times growing up, and I have always enjoyed the food but none of the locations I have been to come close to this one.  The staff is absolutely amazing.  Polite, friendly and they offer fast service.  The food is delicious (who can pass up one of their poutines, I mean- really)?  The decor is similar to other locations but because the restaurant is part of Galeries des Sources, it is right next to a Guzzo theatre so they also have Movie Posters on each wall.  Since it is almost Christmas, they have a beautiful tree up, so we sat right next to it.  It was funny- I was wearing my Star Wars T-shirt and right next to our table, was a Star Wars poster.  The place has good taste.  ;)  Overall, it was a great fast food dining experience and I wish this location was closer to where I lived so I could enjoy their service all of the time."}
{"text":"Not sure what on earth the other reviews were talking about. I'm a fan of a well done dive--I'll cross town for a Waffle House in the south but this was just bland and forgettable hastily thrown together food your roommate in college would make. I had a sandwich, wife had fish and chips (soft, tasteless fries) and we split a coke. With tip and tax came in at almost $30 which means it doesn't even qualify as cheap. Skip it and go to McDonalds -- or better yet any of the much better places along the street.

Point of order: the service was prompt and friendly so there's that."}
{"text":"La Belle Province is one of those restos you go to when you want to eat fat and clog your arteries. It is nonetheless a fair fast food place that offers cheap food and an alright service (last time I went the waiter was very pleasant actually, so one extra point for that). Being vegetarian (pescetarian, to be precise), the menu shrinks a lot for me when I step in there, however if you're craving after weeks of healthy living that one junk meal from Quebec, you are in luck; La Belle Province's classic poutine is vegetarian, its gravy being plant-based. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"The waitress was welcoming to us. We had a tour to catch so everything came out in a timely manner. We had breakfast here. Big portions and good for the price. We all enjoyed our breakfast platters and were stuffed. We couldn't finish it. The decor of the place was nice. Old school, 50s vibe. I would return here on other trips. The coffee could have been a bit stronger. It is a convenient location."}
{"text":"\"I prefer the trashy poutine from La Belle Province\" was the exact recommendation a friend of mine gave on where to find good poutine in Quebec.  And sure enough, La Belle Province (or BellPro, for those in the know) did not disappoint.  This greasy spoon chain may not have much visual appeal, but it serves up a mean poutine that's greasy, delicious, and strangely authentic.

You won't hear much English at this particular location, but we stopped in after not finding any poutine to be had at the Atwater Market.  Although the service was slow and we were lost in translation, our poutine came out hot and delicious.  I had mine plan, he had his with pulled pork.  Both versions were scrumptious, with the pork version edging mine over slightly.  It was also cheap; our meal was about $15 with tip included.

So yes, you may find yourself asking many questions regarding the last time BellPro got a health inspection or what exactly is in that thing you just ordered but the poutine here is good and that's all you need to worry about.  I'm not nearly as adventurous to try the other menu items.  I'll leave that to the locals."}
{"text":"À éviter à tout prix. Leur hot-dog à 79 sous n'en vaut pas le détour, c'était mauvais autant au goût que pour la digestion. Leur poutine est probablement la pire poutine que j'ai mangée de toute ma vie. En plus, la cassière dans sa ménopause a une face de boeuf et une attitude de bitch en permanence. Elle crache presque sur les clients tellement elle haït sa job et elle hurle en blasphémant les commandes même s'il y a des enfants près du comptoir... Je pense que les personnes travaillant à la Belle Province ne sont pas éduqués, c'est assez désolant. Pour être honnête, le McDonald's goûte bien meilleur que ce restaurant-là avec leurs prix exagérement chers. Il y a juste les hot-dogs steamés qui ne coutent pas chers à la Belle Province."}
{"text":"I ordered a bacon poutine and the bacon wasn't even cooked. Disgusting. Make sure you ask them to cook your bacon"}
{"text":"Hey je suis allé à l'Ange Gardien mangé une guedille pis un rotteux avec une patate frite maison! Resto a côté d'une station service. Bon arrêt en in-between Montréal et Sherbrooke.
C'est quoi que je pourrais dire de plus à part: Poutine, Cheese, Souvlaki, Spaghetti, Hot Dog, Pogo, Frites, onion ring? Rien, parce que c'est ça le menu au complet!"}
{"text":"Lazy bunch, always closing way before advertized. Ils sont paresseux et ferme toujours avant l'heure de fermeture."}
{"text":"Breakfast was absolutely delicious. The potatoes served with the meal were made to perfection and the service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"Greasy breakfasts and poutine with smoked meat - that's why we stop into La Belle Province.  Also, it's proximity to La Carrefour Laval makes it an ideal pit stop before a shopping frenzy.

I discovered this location of the chain La Belle Province a few years ago when we were in town for a friend's wedding.  We had to run to the mall to pick up a few things we forgot to pack and thought we'd swing in for a quick pre-wedding poutine.   Now it's just part of the La Carrefour routine.

I ordered the large poutine with smoked meat ($7.99) while others ordered the hot chicken sandwich, breakfast with 2 eggs and the club sandwich with fries.  

To our surprise, there's a small patio attached with a few tables and umbrellas.  Sure, the scenery isn't that impressive - suburban houses and industrial parkway - but it was nice to eat our greasy diner food outdoors.

Staff is always friendly and willing to accommodate food allergies.  Food is diner quality but good in a pinch."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times thinking it was perhaps an off day. Randomly I've had to go to the washroom on two different occasions while here. Both times I have now been told \"oh the wasroom is being fixed\" keep in mind that this is most likely 8 months to a year apart. A place that cannot offer a clean washroom let alone an open one is very bad customer service. Now onto the service , well the cook yells out \" too bad they will have to wait \" as guess what ..... the cashier is not available due to her being gone to the ----- WASHROOM. Get your sh*t together. Learn better customer service and fix your washrooms for your paying clients. Let's not forget. This is what keeps you open. 
Last time ever. If head office is reading this go check the standards of this place please."}
{"text":"I was craving for poutine for days so this time I decided to go one of the well represented fast-food place La Belle Province. 

This one is located in the heart of Downtown Montreal which also it's in the tourist district. I am very disappointed. 

The whole place needs to modernize and make it quick. I ordered my food and paid my money and I don't recall if the cashier said anything to me... I wasn't expecting a thank you note but at least acknowledge my order. 

The price is good if you need a quick fix for poutine. Then again, you get what you pay for. 

I'm disappointed to have this place in the downtown district, knowing the fact how poutine is famous to the world, this location will negatively represent our home city."}
{"text":"Ce commerce n'accepte pas la carte bancaire, c'est dommage our ce type de commerce. Passons!
L'accueil est très médiocre. On ne se sent pas les bienvenus. Bref, on est Venus pour manger... justement, le burger est passable et les frites ne sont pas celles d'une huile fraîche. 
Nous avons été déçus de ce restaurant. L'hygiène y est discutable. La caissière semblait pressée qu'on parte. Lorsqu'elle a une petite faim elle se serre à la main dans le bac de chou avant de le porter à la bouche... nous n'y retournerons pas c'est certain."}
{"text":"Cheap hot dogs, some of the best fries imaginable, the Poutine is great, and the staff speaks English what more can a hungry drunk guy ask for??"}
{"text":"I think one of the first places I ate in Montreal was a Belle Province. I was not impressed. That said, there is a lot of variability across locations, and the one on Wellington is fine if you appreciate it for what it is. Haut cuisine this will never be, but they make a tasty burger or hot dog. 

The decor could use some updating. I'm not sure what the magic ingredient is to achieving a \"retro\" rather than \"old and neglected\" ambiance, but fresh floor tiles (or, you know, something sensible like laminate) and seat cushions that are not held together by duct tape would be a start."}
{"text":"I must say you have to have a poutine when you go to Montreal, but only then, as I felt as if I need to schedule an angioplasty when I was done eating.  Very good I must say but like an anchor in your gut!  The large poutine is like a silver chinese food take out container loaded with 2 levels of curd and gravy......wow my heart hurts thinking about it"}
