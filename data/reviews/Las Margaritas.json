{"text":"I have been here several times and it never disappoints. Service is always fast and friendly. The two salsas they serve taste very fresh. The burrito California with chicken is incredible and the portions for every entree are very generous. Although I am fairly new to Charlotte I have been convinced that this is one of the top Mexican restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Great food!! Had the lunch fajitas steak.  Awesome. Nice salsa!! Service was outstanding"}
{"text":"I would rate Las Margaritas 4.5 stars but half stars are not available.  I have been eating there for the past three years and I eat there often.  Las Margaritas is one of my favorite Mexican resturants.  I usually order a dinner combo with a chicken burrito and a beef taco.  This is an excellent dish.  Sometimes I order the Fajitas which are good but not great.  My only complaint is that they smother everything with tons of cheddar cheese. Keep that in mind when ordering.  I feel the prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"For all the good reviews this place received, I expected a lot better.  I only went there because the reviews were awesome! The foot was terrible, I thought.  It was not really authentic besides the beans.  Mexican is one of my favorites, and this was just a disapointment."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and have enjoyed it.  Service is really friendly.  You get a lot of food for your buck.  The daiquiris are great too. I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Las Margaritas is one of the better Mexican restaurants in east Charlotte. Standard fare Mexican food. You have to be excellent to stay in business in the area with so many competitors. It is great family restaurant . Always good food Always good service. I never have to wait. Great selection of Mexican Cerveza and Margaritas. Can't go wrong. You will leave with a stuffed tummy and still have plenty of  pesos in your pocket."}
{"text":"I go here weekly for the nachos. $7 and its a huge plate, served with beef, beans, guacamole, sour cream, tomatoes, onions and enough cheesy goodness to hold it all together. The decor is wonderfully corny and the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"We went here after reading the reviews and wanting a change from our usual three amigos routine The space and the service were great and very attentive The chips were warm (always a plus) and the pico was AWESOME   I got the carnitas de puerco and my girl got the chicken tacos my carnitas were tough and fatty and it tasted like they hadn't changed their fry-o-later oil recently, but all the things that came with it were awesome, guac was great, pickled onions and other pickled veggies (nopal, and pico with beans in it) we awesome and unexpected.  beans and rice were standard  her chicken tacos were very standard and nothing to write home about  i might give it another try cause the service was so sweet, we'll see."}
{"text":"I used to go here when I lived in Charlotte the First time. I recently moved back so we returned to las margaritas hoping it was as good as I remembered it.  It was better!  The prices are reasonable and the portions are pretty large (def can take half for lunch the next day).  I feel like it's def one of the more authentic Mexican restaurants in the area.  No nasty velveeta like some other places in the area. My family's Mexican and when I took my parents here they both approved.  Try it out!  Ps- the carne asada is awesome!"}
{"text":"Went again last night. It was delicious. They have the best chips and salsa ever made in the history of the world (legit). As usual, we got good service and the food was great!"}
{"text":"First of all there was dishonesty in pricing over charged me $4.75 other then that food was oaky don't recommended as authentic Mexican food"}
{"text":"It's good. I can see how this reminds people of home. It's cozy. Latin music in the background . It's simple. I came for sancocho but it was not available :( so I went with a different soup served with rice arepa and avocado. And we also got the flank steak which was super soft. We had to wait a bit too long but I understand it takes a bit to  cook good food from scratch. The service was great. Very pleasant, caring ladies. However as much as I liked everyone I primarily went there for sancocho and tres leches cake or flan and there wasn't any. I was informed that its available on the weekend. Maybe I should go there on the weekend...."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and my husband hit Yelp to try to find a good place for lunch. Las Margaritas' 4 and 5 star reviews stood out. It was Cinco de Mayo, and Mexican seemed like an ideal choice.  The menu is good, and the lunch specials are available even on weekends. We each ordered one of the lunch specials for $5-$6. My husband ordered the Arroz con Pollo (his standard) and I tried a dish new to me... \"Chilaquile\" or something like that. I was in it for the tomatillo sauce. Kind of like an open faced burrito with corn tortillas.  The beer was cold. The salsa (both a veggie based slaw-type salsa and a regular thin medium tomato-based salsa) was good. The chips were fresh and warm. Our food was excellent, and portion sizes were generous for the prices we paid at lunchtime. Service was fantastic and a great soccer game was on the telly.  For me, a 5-star rating means there's nothing I can find fault with or suggest improvement upon. Las Margaritas is a humble strip mall Mexican restaurant that serves delicious food at great prices and with attentive service. For what it is, I can suggest nothing at all to improve upon. If we're ever in the neighborhood, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place deserves every star. The food is great. Nothing over the top but good quality. What i love the most is the waitstaff. They are always friendly and attentive. I dont get here often but i always have a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"This place quickly became my roomates and my Sunday morning place.  I cant even remember where it was that we used to go, but we tried this place once and we never went back to our original hole.  Very quick as expected,  we have probably ordered 10-15 (with various friends we would bring along)  different things on the menu and I cant remember one we didnt like enough to order again.   Great place, kind of a pain with all of the independence construction, but whatever, I mean its Independence, I feel its been under construction for 20 years."}
{"text":"Why does this place have four stars? It makes zero sense.  There aren't any great Mexican places in Eastland, and this is no exception.  Completely average Mexican food that I've had at dozens of different Mexican restaurants through multiple states. Margaritas is different thanks to their slower service, terrible interior, and even worse parking lot.  I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"In the 7 years since I moved from my home of Los Angeles I have NEVER found good mexican good.  The east coast just doesn't bring it the way I hoped.  Enter Las Margaritas! It's like being home again with authentic hole in the wall mexican joints that are as easy to find as a Subway in Southern California.    We eat here now about 1-2 times a week and love it every single time.    I'm happy we stumbled into this unassuming little place as it makes Charlotte feel even more like home."}
{"text":"I come here fairly often for lunch since I work nearby. Everyone is so friendly and the food is always good. you definitely get your money's worth too. For the same price as a drive thru, you can get a much better meal here."}
{"text":"We dined here last night based on yelp reviews and it was close to our hotel. The place is not all that fancy - located on a busy main road with a bunch of construction going on. Once inside we were greeted by our very friendly server. Chips, salsa and pico quickly followed. My husband is extremely picky about his margaritas and our Texas margaritas on the rocks did not disappoint. Our food arrived quickly and portions were generous. I really enjoyed my mojarra frita. I order it often, and I particularly like the way this one was seasoned, and was extra crispy. I was surprised this place wasn't busier on a Saturday night. It might be the location, or the road construction but based on food, drinks and service, I would give them a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I always get carnitas. Enough for two great meals, some times 3! The service is always friendly and quick. They remember you every time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch haunts.  A nice selection of traditional \"American\" style Mexican dishes along with more authentic fare.  Service is always good and fast.  Consistently very good food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place is becoming a habit. I am hooked on the chicken fajitas and find myself trying to talk the hubs into going here at least once a week (he usually shows restraint and limits me to every other week).   As much as I love the food, it's the service that really makes this place shine. Never any issues if you ask for extras, want more chips and salsa? Just ask and it will appear before you, no hassle like some other places. The place is always clean and I find the seating to be comfortable.   The only food I have tried are the fajitas, and at some places I think that makes me narrow minded but when it comes to Mexican food, I like what I like!   I am so happy to live so close to this place!! I'm already thinking about going for lunch since I'm guessing the hubs won't want to go for dinner."}
{"text":"This is a great little place, a pleasant surprise for authentic Mexican food. The portions are huge and the quality of food is amazing. We took one of the other reviews advice and mix the salsa and slaw together.   We started off with cheese dip that comes in a bowl so if you like cheese dip make sure you order that. The mango frozen margaritas were delicious and I'm a huge fan of the Midori margarita.  We decided to split meals so we had the shredded beef quesadilla the Chicken soup and the shredded chicken chimichanga. This soup you have to try it comes in like a gallon size bowl so there's plenty take-home.  So if you're craving Mexican want a margarita and need enough food to eat the next day come on by won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Where do you go when you need that greasy Mexican fix?  Me I go to Las Margaritas.  Sure you can choose one of the other ten Mexican joints on  Independence but then you wouldn't receive the friendly service and $5 bucket of Coronitas that Las Margaritas serves everyday.  Cheese dip, tacos, and beer isn't that what Mexican food is all about!   *Yes from time to time I will throw a margarita into the mix"}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic, delicious. Fast friendly service. Wish we lived in Charlotte so we could eat here more often.  Decor is old and worn. Feels like an old family restaurant. Casual.  Vegetarian menu options. The spinach quesadilla is great."}
{"text":"Meh. I'm a little on the snobby side when it comes to my Mexican. This place really isn't bad by any means but it definitely isn't in the same ballpark of some of my other hot spot joints.   The food quality is OK depending on what you're getting I suppose. Personally, I was a little offended my carnitas were of the chunky and deep fried variation. Not my cup of tea man. The nachos and cheese dip were as expected.   The kid's quesadilla was the smallest quesadilla on the face of this planet. The potion sizes otherwise seem really decent, I will admit that. Prices are pretty modest with a diverse menu and good selection of alcohol.   I wasn't that impressed with the layout/ atmosphere. It feels more like a fast food restaurant than a nicer sit-down restaurant.  My kid may or may not have gotten sick here.   If I found myself in the area again, I might give the menu another go around."}
{"text":"Great food and huge portions for the prices!  Interior decor leaves a bit to be desired, but if you want some decent Mexican, quick and reasonably priced, this is an option for you!"}
{"text":"Four and a half stars, actually.  This is one of my two go-to Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, depending on what part of town I'm in and which one is closer.  Love the salsa, almost always get the Carnitas, never had a bad meal.  Have taken groups of 8-10 in for lunch and still got great service.  Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have had so many things from the menu and they are all great! Prices are super affordable and large portion sizes."}
{"text":"Behold. A magical Mexican food wonderland for you to discover, and everything is served on a plate the size of a truck tire. Fantastic."}
{"text":"Hubby being from Houston and me eating a lot of mexican/texmex while we were dating.....mexican food anywhere else is like a joke. Unless you are willing to try cantinas # something. Now those are always the best! Anyway there are days when Hubby gets really nostalgic and craves Mexican food so we decided to try Las Margarita because it was close to home and it always looks packed when we drive by.  The service was awesome! we got so many refills of chips and salsa. The salsa was made fresh. The Margarita was really yum too. I ordered the chicken tacos and hubby got the fajitas. Both of us were satisfied with the dishes we ordered. Maybe there are other mexican restaurants that are more authentic out there but this place sure beats the typical on the border or chevys. But if you are about the ambiance rather than the food then this is not the place for you. Its a huge restaurant with great service and good food. Order a pitcher of Margarita and Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We ordered out from here one night and were overall pretty pleased. It's good if you are just looking for some basic Mexican food.  They have two kinds of salsa and the cheese dip was the same as you would get anywhere else. We had bean burritos which were huge, and covered with cheese sauce and each had a side of rice which has some vegetables in it. The rice was delicious, nice and fluffy. We will def. be ordering from here again in the future when we need to satisfy our craving for Mexican."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. Food is consistently good, we love to stop in often."}
{"text":"When my girlfriend (who is Colombian) highly recommended this place....we all had to try it. And true to her review.....the food and service was amazing.  The owner Alonso definitely makes you feel so welcomed and is a gracious Host who patiently explained the menu for us.  The food was fantastic.....but the deserts even better. I wont even try to pronounce....but having figs with cheese was just mouth watering good.  And like that was not good enough.....the dj played some wicked tunes and we danced till after midnight.   I will go there again and high recommend this place if you craving some good Colombian food."}
{"text":"Affordable lunch specials on weekdays. Sit in the middle of the restaurant to avoid very cold draft from front door. Excellent beer selection and the bartender can make over 100 different kinds of margarita. Can accommodate large parties up to 50. Chocolate cake was very moist and delicious."}
{"text":"Great hidden spot off the busy freeway. Awesome prices and awesome food. Ordered a takeout order and it was ready and hot when I got there in 15 minutes. Love their pico de gallo and chimichanga! I ordered two entrees for $13 including tax. Go to a chain restaurant and you'll get half that food for that price. The staff is really friendly and the food is fresh. Can't go wrong here. Can't wait to try a margarita next time!"}
{"text":"Me and my friends go often because the restaurant is a 'no hassle' spot.  The food is consistently good and the wait staff is always super friendly.  No matter if we go as a couple or a party of 20+, we have never had to wait.  Being a native Carolinian, I'm not the best judge of authentic Mexican cuisine, but this food is full of flavor without being overpoweringly spicy.  I'm glad that the lacking decor turns people away so I always have a seat!"}
{"text":"We frequent this establishment 1-2 times a week! We love our Mexican food and this place has been a superb find. Probably some of the best enchiladas (chicken) we have had in a long time. I tend to order chicken-steak fajitas. We always get beef nachos. Good salsa...not too spicy. We always get our food to go, but if you want to eat in there is plenty of room, it's clean and the service is always good and friendly! So from a big Mexican food fan who is used to food in Chicago, go ahead and give this place a try. I am sure you won't be disappointed when you realize it's affordable and you have leftovers! Be alert though when you drive to this place, it's in a strip mall on the right-hand side if traveling East on Independence...just before Brazaz"}
{"text":"Grilled shrimp tacos and 3 item combination everything was delicious and the service was good as well. Shrimp were cooked perfectly, pico de gallo fresh and the chicken in the enchiladas was tender. Only complaint the red enchilada sauce was half assed and like many mexican restaurants the table salsa was lackluster but overall the food was good."}
{"text":"this place is awesome! the servers and staff are very friendly, even as the restaurant seems busy. food is consistently great. my favorite is the burrito, i get it with ground beef. my boyfriend enjoys the steak nachos. chimichanga is great as well. cheese dip-always great. we love having las margaritas as a neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"The staff is awesome!! The food was good and very large portions! Staff seems to all work together. They have great drink specials and the virgin drinks are awesome too! Loved they offer 2 types of salsas."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before but something is different and not in a good way.. I was quickly seated which was great but couldn't decide what I wanted so I decided to order one Mexican style taco I was told that I couldn't just order one or I would bd charged for chips and salsa I never encountered this before and I've been to several Mexican restaurant when my tacos did come out the tortilla shells were too greasy and I had to send it back the second time the tacos were better but forcing someone to spend a certain amount of money is just wrong I won't be back ."}
{"text":"Service is ok..dark atmosphere, and floor was very dirty, restroom was dirty...apparenly the kitchen is in the same condition..my co-worker and myself got extremely sick for two days after having lunch."}
{"text":"Eh. It's not Texmex but it's decent. I had chicken quesadillas. They were decent. Service was good. Margaritas were on the weak side but since I rate to never have one, it was fine to share. If you're a margarita loving Texmex person, you might keep looking. But if you're looking for a hole in the wall family friendly guy next door place with decent food, stop on in."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying this place. I actually used yelp reviews to find a good Mexican spot for lunch, and the reviews were right on.   I got the beef nachos, the lunch fajitas (steak) and the lunch burrito. The portion sizes are excellent and the quality is good too. They have flour AND corn tortillas, so my husband could share with me (he's got the gluten thingy). Of course there was the standards that come with Mexican food; beans and rice, chips and salsa. I love the extras! Three adults had more food than we could eat for $20 (including guacamole!)."}
{"text":"I ate here for business. The food is good but the service is slow.  Good prices"}
{"text":"Good food, huge portions, good prices! Salsa and chips are both very fresh. Service is excellent. Atmosphere is typical for a casual Mexican establishment. Will definitely return next time a craving for Mexican food hits!"}
{"text":"Portions are huge, it's the best mexican food I've found over the years.My comfort food if i'm back in the area, especially if it's during lunch hours,when the prices are super reasonable."}
{"text":"Since moving to Charlotte I have been searching for the right Mexican Restaurant. I lived in Wilmington, NC and I had a specific spot to fulfill my Mexican food cravings. I was hesitant at first on ordering from here, but I'm grateful that I did. The food is excellent, as well as the staff. The portions and prices are fair. This has become my \"spot\" for Mexican food in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I have only been to Chuys and Pacos tacos in Charlotte so far. This is much closer to my native Tex Mex than the other versions. I would return if I had no other recommendations."}
{"text":"I went to Las Margaritas for my birthday dinner this year and it was great authentic mexican food.  I am a vegetarian, and they had a specific part of the menu that catered to vegetarians, which really turned me on the place.    I went with my brother-in-law who is from Mexico and this is also his favorite mexican restaurant.  Not just for the food, but for the excellent service.  The entire wait staff works together, and like Tony said in his review, they are willing to make dishes that aren't on the menu.  If you go, you should try the Horchata, this is a mexican rice based drink that compliments any Mexican dish.    I was surprised with a song and dance from the wait staff that was both hilarious and embarrassing in the same.  My waitress put a sambrara on my head and sang to me as my face turned as red as a tomato.  Anyways, I would recommend everything about the place (just don't let them know that it's your bday)!"}
{"text":"I met a group of people for dinner tonight as Las Margaritas.  Most of the party arrived separately, but chips and salsas were plentiful as we waited.  The menu seems to be reasonably varied, and had a number of items that sounded good to me.  Plates for the entire group (around 10) came out very close together, which I appreciated so much.  It is SO awkward to be the one stuck at a table for 20 minutes without anything, while the rest of the table tries to decide if they should be polite and wait for you (and subject themselves to cold food) or to dig in and be rude.  I chose the Pollo Asado, which arrived on a GIANT plate.  I received 2 pieces of pounded, citrus-marinated chicken breast, rice and beans, and a pico de gallo that was different from the one served on the table (spicier, and a bit more macerated.  Also yummy).  The chicken had just the right amount of char, and the marinade had clearly served it well, since it managed to remain flavorful and not dry.  Service overall seemed to be on point, yet unobtrusive.  Our server didn't bat an eye when we announced that each of us would like separate checks, and to go boxes were brought without me feeling like I was being rushed out the door.  I enjoyed my meal, and would return when I happened to be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Newly owned, revamped and renamed, now Columbia Mia, offers a treat to those craving something different, something exotic, something MEAT. This place is owned by a gentleman named Alonso. Kudos to this guy, he welcomed us in like he was welcoming old friends to his own home.   THE RESTAURANT: It's a spacious place, nice seating, nice lighting, fantastic chic decor, and a huge booth in one corner that made me want to come back with a group of friends. Located near downtown Mississauga, on one of the most crazy-in-terms-of-traffic-and-all-kinds-of-business intersection, Dundas and Hurontario. When I walked in on a Thursday night, we were the only ones, but I'd be shocked if this place wasn't packed on Friday-Saturday nights.   THE SERVICE: We were served by Alonso (the owner) and a waitress. Both were very personable and helped us understand the menu. Alonso has the gift of the gab and he spoke of Columbian culture, food and how he came about to starting this business of his. I always like such passionate people and it was solely because of him that I took an instant liking to the place. The food and drinks just solidified my liking.   THE FOOD:  So much to choose from. Everything in the menu is Columbian, explained in English below. And I can't seem to remember the Columbian names of what we ordered. But here goes - my friend ordered a platter of different kinds of meat. And I ordered a chicken skewer wrapped in bacon. Both our dishes were delicious and filling. This is as authentic as it gets, folks!  THE DRINKS:  Columbia Mia comes with all good things and a bar! And Alonso happens to be a brute of a bartender. My friend ordered Columbian wine. And I ordered my Margarita, off the menu. I was wondering if he'd be able to get my salt rimmed, triple sec-ed Margarita right... AND HE DID! I would usually frown at a Margarita that costs $9. But damn, that drink made me so happy.  PRICES: Reasonable  VERDICT:  Only Columbian place I know... and I am not tempted to explore elsewhere. This is my new go-to place and should be yours too!!"}
{"text":"Top notch eatin joint. Good tacos, salsa variety, and the eye-pleasing interior design make this place a good bet."}
{"text":"I had been looking for a Mexican restaurant like this one ever since I moved to Charlotte...  It was the cheap, authentic style Mexican food that I've been looking for. I got the basic tacos with rice/beans and delicious XX beers."}
{"text":"Milagro! Good Mexican in NC! Say what you want about So. Cal's immigration probs, the accompanying food is friggin awesome! I missed (ie. was mad fienin') some real, good, filling, comforting, diet busting Mexican upon moving to NC. When I worked a few miles from Las Margarita, I musta passed this place in a run down (seemingly half vacant) strip mall on seedy Independence a million times. Muchos Gracias to my coworker at my next job for enlightening me.   In the eight (nine???) years I've been here, this is the best Meh-he-can I've found. When you walk in for lunch and the place is fulla south of the border patrons, that's a great sign. When the eats are cheap, like the best places in L.A., that's an even better sign. Fajitas. Good. Street tacos. Freakin' good. Burritos, chimichangas, enchiladas... amen&pass the salsa, I'm home!!!! I have never been disappointed. I don't make the drive often enough (I live in the north boonies) but when I'm down there, it's Las Margarita for mi, mi hombre, mijo y bambino."}
{"text":"One of my favorites on independence drive. Chips and salsa aways fresh.  Veg burritos incredible. Tonight had the mushrooms quesadilla.   Awesome.  Service epic and friendly.  Prices great. Atmosphere pleasantly causal.  Eat here often"}
{"text":"I have been to this place at least 50 times. While they are not my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, (that would be Monterrey at Windsor Square), they are still good. Las Margaritas is only a few blocks from my work place, so it is one of my regular lunch places. The food is good and their prices are great. They have over 20 lunch items all around $6. They give you tons of food even at lunch. (Compared to Monterrey, who's lunch portion is about half the size of dinner.) The staff is always very friendly and service is good.   A few issues I have are 1) sometimes their shredded chicken can be a little tough, I think sometimes they don't shred it enough. 2) The orange cheese (cheddar I guess) , though I have learned to live with it. 3) Salsa is so so but I do like their pico.  My favorite dishe is the Chilaquiles. It is tortilla chips cooked with some kind of sauce with shredded chicken and some sort of white cheese. Doesn't sound that good, but it is delicious. Love the vegetarian burrito, the enchiladas (ground beef), Pollo con arroz and Carnitas. Because I normally only eat lunch here, I can't really judge the more expensive entrees.  Overall, large portions of good food, for a reasonable price, served by friendly staff. A solid 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Very good place to me anyway. Very authentic Mexican dishes offered plus the usual expected type items on the menu and presented very nicely, brightly colored room, very clean with fast service and super, super friendly staff that are sincerely glad you came. Very much worth trying if you really love Mexican food and fantastic Margaritas."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets!   Good authentic Colombian Food at reasonable prices. Everytime I come here I get a little taste from home, I'm not from Colombia but Hispanic food always feels you at home! At least for me.   They sell everything from soups to carne Asada, and of course my fave Colombian drink Postobon, you have to try it! You must have to, I swear there must be crack in that stuff it's so addicting! Oh and Colombian empanadas are the bomb. I came here and got literally stuffed and left with a happy stomach:)   I got some awesome bean soup(not chili) to start with, which was filling and very tasty. Then I got a plate of white rice, fried eggs, steak, fried plantain, and chicharron which is basically deep fried pig fat. It sounds nasty & fattening but its soo good. If your Hispanic you know what this is and is part of the regular Hispanic diet. I was stuffed! As for the service, there's one waitress because the place doesn't get so busy and it's pretty small but the waitress is very attentive and nice.   This place has good home made food which will fill you up and make you leave very happy and will probably give you the itis!   The only complain would be that it should stay opened a little later, and possibly make the place a bit bigger. That's my only complain which is pretty okay! Give this cute & cozy place a try!"}
{"text":"Las Margaritas is not the place to go if you're trying to diet and count calories.  However, if you want plentiful, inexpensive, quick, and tasty Mexican food, I totally nominate this place.  I love love LOVE guacamole.  Matter of fact, I feel like I'm kind of a connoisseur of of guacamole, and so I get pretty ecstatic when I find a good batch of it.  I can honestly say that their guacamole ranks pretty highly in my book.  It tastes fresh, not too salty, and can be purchased for quite a reasonable price here (less than $4, I believe, for a pretty generous portion).  Their chips and salsa are wonderful as well.  They have nice, thick tortilla chips, which taste fresh, warm, and homemade.  They bring out two different salsas to go with them; one smooth and one more chunky.  Both are different and equally wonderful.  My partner and I both ordered combos from them.  I had a tamale and chile relleno, both of which were pretty tasty.  I have never had a chile relleno quite like that, which was more like an omelet with cheese, chiles, and meat.  I will warn you, both of them had quite a bit of grease leaking out of them, which suits me just fine but could be a turn-off to people who don't care for really greasy food.  My partner ordered a taco, which he really enjoyed as well.  I really like their rice as well.  I thought it had a mild flavor, not too salty, and no overwhelming tomato taste (which I don't care for in rice).  Their beans were not bad as well, and tasted like typical refried beans.  While I didn't order them, they had some great drink specials and prices on drinks.  Service there was wonderful - our food came out quickly, and our waitress was friendly and attentive.  Parking does not seem like a problem, but it may be a little difficult to get into the parking lot if coming west on Independence.  The decor was bright and typical of many Mexican restaurants.  I am totally excited to hit this place up again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for your simple, typical Mexican cuisine you have found the right spot.  We saw this restaurant on Yelp and figured we would give it a try since we were in the neighborhood.  It has cute decor on the inside, not the best location for a restaurant but some things can't be helped and it looks like the area is being updated/remodeled/reworked.  The salsa was okay, not the typical awesome salsa but more chunky and two types.  The cheese dip was titled Land O'Lakes Cheese dip so that basically tells you how that was.  We tried the veggie quesadilla and carne asada.  Both were okay, smaller portions than most Mexican spots which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Service was okay.  I tried a margarita, it tasted like one your friend would attempt to make for you at home.  We really wanted to like this place based on other reviews, but it just didn't compare to other spots in the area.  Prices were reasonable though and if they rework the menu a bit and add some classic dishes and go the more classic route with their salsa, and cheese dip they'd draw a bigger crowd in on a weekend evening, which is when we went and it was pretty empty.  We'd probably give it another shot then."}
{"text":"Las Margaritas is the one of the best Mexican restaurants in Charlotte.  Food is always good and the service is too. Great place for lunch or dinner.  The pico de gallo is awesome as is the chicken soup.  I also like their fajitas and carne asada.  Very reasonably priced and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love love this place, authentic mexican food, with great prices.  Love the lunch hour menu, the portions are huge!  The servers are way to friendly lol. This place is child friendly since it's a big and open space where doesn't feel crowded."}
{"text":"Loved the fajitas that I got for lunch. Probably some of the best in town. Also got a pitcher of margarita and it was delicious! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My sister invited me to CLT to come celebrate my nephew's 2nd birthday.  This is apparently his favorite restaurant, so I decided to make the trek from MEM to come see family and friends.   One thing I would like to note is with all of the construction going on, it is a pain in the ass to enter/exit.  Make sure you get it right the first time, or it may take another 10 minutes to go around the block.  We finally made it, and I assume sis made reservations for us, as we got a long table at the bar for 12 or so people.  A 2 year olds birthday at the bar- that's what I am talking about!  The décor was simple, yet colorful.  The menu was straightforward Mexican.  I ordered some Texas (shrimp chicken steak) fajitas.  Mind you I was pretty hungry.  The food ending up coming out and the one thing I couldn't help but notice was how big all of the plates were.  And heavy.  You could do 10 reps with a plate and call it a workout.    Two other things I noticed off the bat- where was the cheese, and how am I supposed to make only 3 fajitas with a plate this big?  I tried to venture outside of my normal fajita eating habits (just meat, with lots of cheese).  It was solid!  The grease replaced the cheese I guess you could say.  After I packed 3, I just ate the rest of it off the skillet.    While I was eating and the staff was checking on us, the waitress kept rubbing on my shoulders and such.  I was about to tell her you can take me out back but I am with my family.  At that moment, I felt like \"Gator\" in \"The Other Guys\".  Awkward? Slightly...  I didn't drink anything alcoholic (saved it for after), but they did have a full bar.  The do sell Coke as well (yea!)- so that was a plus.  I can't even remember if I had dessert either.    This is some solid authentic Mexican here, and it's definitely different than what I am used to having.  Worth a shot!"}
{"text":"I use to eat at this restaurant all the time, and once they started construction on Independence I forgot all about it.  But yesterday I really wanted Mexican food really bad, and decided to return they upgraded the place a lot it looks a lot better than it use to look really nice and the staff are sweet.  The food wow the food was amazing, I had the fajita burrito and it was about as big as the big factory one they serve at Cheesecake factory.  Much cheaper version and really fantastic just awesome it was soo much food I had to get the rest to go, the plates were huge they didn't skimp on anything just awesome you should try it."}
{"text":"Las Margaritas is a great mexican restaurant. Usually, my family and I would eat as Don Pedro's, but after eating here, we switched. Food is a bit cheaper, a bit better, and the atmosphere is fitting for a mexican restaurant. Service is also very good and there are rarely any issues. I'm yet to have a bad food experience, their cheese enchilada is to die for! Also, their complementary salsa and chips are delicious, as well as the cinnamon-cream desert chips that come with the bill. Portions are huge, but filling, and you always leave happy! Great restaurant that I will return to!."}
{"text":"Waitress really non attentive. Food not really up to par. Three entree combo asked for no green peppers first thing I cut into green peppers.   Neighbor across from me said the shrimp was way too small to be called jumbo shrimp.   Diet Coke flat no carbonation. Put beans on my plate didn't ask for them, they don't seem to really enjoy their job too much place cleared out real fast.   Have not been here in a long time don't plan on revisiting anytime soon."}
{"text":"Their lunch specials are nuts portion wise. From somewhere between $5-7 you can get pretty much a double portion of a lot of mexican standards. I opted for chilaquiles which were pretty solid and tasted damn near as good the next dar when I microwaved them at the office. So that's like $3 per lunch?! Insane."}
{"text":"This was some of the friendliest service I've had in awhile. Our server was very sweet and did a great job with making conversation while not being overbearing. The chips served were pretty tasty, they serve a pickled pico-style along with a traditional mild salsa.   We each had the chimichanga's with beef and they were excellent- very crispy served with guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, tomato, pickled veggies, rice, and refried beans. The dish was HUGE. We left completely stuffed. For a mere $25 we had two dinners, two drinks + tip so it was an incredible value.  I can't wait to go back and try their very reasonably price mojitos (under $5!)   Enjoyed it and will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"We came upon this awesome hole-in-the-wall Sunday brunch spot during our girls' reunion and were enamored at first sight with the quirky decor and the spacious patio area. We decided to go with the all you can eat and drink brunch buffet, which was excellent and included chicken enchiladas, patatas con tomate, and a custom omelette bar. Our waitress, Angie, wrote her name down on our paper tablecloth at the beginning, which I thought was nice and was only the start of her extremely personalized and wonderful service throughout our dining experience. Sitting out on the patio with the fans blowing in our faces as we drank our awesome bottomless drinks (the mojitos are out of this world) felt like a really authentic experience. and Angie bringing us our tequila shots followed by sangrita chasers was a plus too! All in all a great experience and would definitely recommend to everyone in town for a unique Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Las Margaritas since it was named something different (El Valle, if memory serves), and as I can recall, it's about the same, other than the name thing.  Of course, these days, the restaurants all look about the same - now I'm really starting to sound old!  On this particular night, I had a burrito, and the ingredients tasted fresh, as has been mentioned before, but I'll have to say that by the time we arrived, I was pretty beat, so I was just glad to be able to have something to eat.  I'll also concur with Tony C, and say that the service here was top-notch, and if there is anything that falters, it's probably the food.  It isn't that it's bad, it's just that it's not outstanding."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times I've been flying down Independence Blvd (and by flying, I of course mean driving the safe and comfortable speed limit) and went right by this place without ever giving it a second thought.   Yelp led me here a few weeks ago. And then I came back a week later. Fast forward to today, I took my roommate here. To sum it up, I'm three for three in the weeks of September.  The lunch menu here is a pretty good deal. Most of the meals are less than $6. Today I went with a combination of enchilada and taco. The roomie went arroz con pollo. Huge portions. She took half of hers home for lunch. I accidentally consumed everything on my plate. Gah, I've got to get back into yoga if I keep eating like this. I think our bill was maybe $16 with tax.  The chips come with both a salsa and a pico slaw type salsa. I recommend mixing the two together. You're welcome.  The people who work here are really friendly. During my first visit here, one of the waitresses sat and walked me through the menu. So nice.   Getting back on Independence can take some patience. I avoid it and go out a back way. The road dumps you at Sharon Amity. Perfect for me. I just have to take Monroe to make the trek home.  Craving some Mexican and some chips and salsa? This place hits the spot."}
{"text":"This is truly the best Mexican food I've ever had--high quality dishes with fresh ingredients.  They served large portions at a ridiculously reasonable cost, and I've never had such good service from the staff there.  They went out of their way to serve me with style.  Even though I have family in. Charlotte, I might have to come back here just to come to Las Margaritas!"}
{"text":"We love Las Margaritas and have been going here regularly for at least 10 years.  The friendly owners and staff are committed to serving perfectly prepared traditional Mexican food with special touches that keep us coming back.  Try the satisfying pork tacos - simple and flavorful (be sure to ask for the green salsa, it's delicious).  Their tortilla soup is homey and comforting.  We love everything we order, but keep coming back to the combination plate.  Our usual choice is chile rellenos (the delicate omelet-like coating makes it special) and an earthy tamale stuffed with pork. The accompanying refried beans and rice are exceptionally good - we clean our plates every time.  We request our platters super hot so the rice is crispy on the edges and the refried beans are slightly baked.     The restaurant is super clean and perfect for families, groups or an informal date."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place. We had never been, but she dragged us here on Christmas Eve. It turns out she knows most of the servers there, as she and her ex-boyfriend would frequent the place quite often last year.  WOW! We were impressed by the service, the portions, and the freshness of the food. The Pico De Gallo is great. The salsa is great. The guacamole is wonderful. It's all fresh, and the chips are warm!  The plates are at least 16 inches in diameter, and there's enough food on the typical entree to feed two adults. My 84-year-old parents shared a steak plate that filled them up with enough left over for another person. My wife and I each had lots left over. One of the twins had a kid meal and took 2/3 of it home. The other one took half of his home. My daughter also had leftovers of her vegetarian fajitas.  These folks have an extensive menu, and they will make adjustments or substitutions for you. They want you to be happy and full, and they are very attentive to your needs. We had a \"water glass accident\" (spill), and they were on it immediately.  We will definitely return to this place. It's authentic, very reasonably priced, and festive. We will have to remember to be starving when we get there...  Do print a Google Map or use your GPS to find it the first time, though. It is in a strip shopping center just off Independence freeway, but is best accessed from the neighborhood streets off of Sharon Amity, just West/South of Independence."}
{"text":"The best Mexican in the Queen City! Great prices and friendly staff. The pico de gallo is so fresh. Never have I had anything bad."}
{"text":"Solid tex-mex. I usually head to Don Pedros or Azteca when the craving for a Nopales burrito hits but this place works just as well.  They do good business at lunch, but the space is cavernous, so there's never a wait. Slaw and watery salsa in your face immediately as you sit. Optional white rice, if you ask. They're cool about being picky, so you can request all three sauces on your 'rito, if you'd like, or get fresh AND pickled jalapenos, or add veggies, no cheese, etc.   Nothing's particularly deeply flavored or spicy, but for 5 bucks, Margaritas lunch can't be beat."}
{"text":"Why the high ratings? Had lunch with colleagues. Service was fine. The waitresses were authentically Mexican and spoke to me pretty much in Spanish only, which was fine. It is a Mexican restaurant after all. I had a shrimp tacos, beans & rice, and a margarita. The margarita was weak. Do not order one. The shrimp tacos had NO flavor. NONE. The shrimp could be easily improved upon with lemon or lime and a dash of salt and pepper. I don't like beans and the rice was \"aiiight\". Overall, edible, but very underwhelming food."}
{"text":"Always prompt service, even on Cinco de Mayo! The food comes out hot & quick. The staff is always friendly. This is my go-to authentic Mexican spot & has been for years! Viva la Mexico!!"}
{"text":"The salsa and the rice are really good, after that not that impressive. The chicken taste like it came out of a can and the beef is not much better  You have to ask for you tacos to be made in the traditional (authentico) fashion... Else they may assume you want it Tex Mex style."}
{"text":"Chicken creama is delicious!  We've been here a couple times and I really enjoy the food. Their salsa is also better than most places for chip and salsa."}
{"text":"This was not a great experience. The service was kind of slow, especially to refill drinks. We were with a small group and we ordered the cheese dip with spinach and the other group ordered regular cheese dip. The cheese dip was extremely runny. We made a huge mess because it just wouldn't stay on the chips at all. And the spinach cheese dip was really bad because the spinach was cold and it was just really long strands of spinach. It should have been diced up and mixed it. The entrees were ordered were very bland and my chicken was dry. The beans were also a little on the runny side as well. The rice was amazing. It was the best part of the meal. I guess long story short is this place is edible, but there are a lot of better choices close by. I doubt we will be returning."}
{"text":"Las Margaritas is known for its fantastic carnitas de puerco, which come in a huge portion size, garnished with such gastronomic delights as pickled red onions and guacamole. I've also really enjoyed most of the vegetarian menu, which is about the same size and selection as many other Mexican restaurants in town. The pollo poblano is wonderfully rich with mole sauce. If you're looking for a cheap dinner, the burrito supremo with either chicken or ground beef is the way to go; it's big and topped with tomatoes, cheese, and guacamole.  Lunch is cheap, delicious, and generous. It's the only time they offer the delicious avocado tostada. You can get the lunch specials on weekends, which more places should do.  The decor is bright, with an open-ductwork ceiling that has been painted the same yellow as the walls. Recently I noticed they've hung some sombreros from the ceiling in between the lights. The overall effect is festive and feels more open than it really is.  Portion sizes are downright majestic on many of the entrees. It's not the most authentic Mexican food around (for one thing, they use a lot of yellow cheese), but it's delicious and served by a friendly and attentive wait staff. They're quick to offer seemingly endless refills of the free chips, salsa, and a pico de gallo that I want to just eat up with a spoon all by itself."}
{"text":"I stopped in by accident...was hungry and too tired to cook. I'm Cuban transplant from Miami so I figured it couldn't hurt to try Las Margaritas. I got the grilled skirt steak platter...a bit expensive, but I got to choose how the steak was cooked. Enough food to feed me x3 (I'm a gastric bypass survivor). Tons of steak, rice and beans! Some kind of guacamole garnishment on top, that made everything else tasty! I got it 'to go' and I would absolutely return to eat inside! This restaurant is in a small strip mall on E.Independence and because of the road changes there if you are not aware, you could pass it by. If you enter via Monroe Rd, turn on Lanier and go until it dead ends and you will be at the strip mall it is in. It will be my new BEST go to restaurant for the Cotswold area I live inn."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and recount flavorable memories.  So, I eagerly anticipated my return.  The tradional chips were on the table, but with several salsas.  Each were good in their own way, but none of them were very spicy. I ordered the spinach enchilada.  It came with rice and beans on a huge plate.  I have had this in the past, but remember it having more flavor.  The spinach needed salt, and it all just tasted bland.  I did put a little salsa on the food to perk it up.  I noticed in the menu, desserts was spelled \"deserts.\"  I did not order any, but it was not because of the misspelling. The waitress brought us a complimentary sugary treat after our meal, which was a nice touch. I will try it again.  An off night can happen anywhere, even in my own kitchen."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and great prices. This place does not disappoint. I will be back :-)."}
{"text":"Great food, great value, great service. Amazing portions, great chicken and fresh ingredients. And a good margarita! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place I go here all the time and the food is delicious always great fast service"}
{"text":"A solid Mexican restaurant with great friendly service.  The food was pretty decent.  Certainly not the best I have had, but pretty good.  The waitress was friendly with our kids which is always a bonus.   The fajitas were good and the Mexican ice cream was decent.  My husband's burrito was HUGE!"}
{"text":"I experienced the worst customer service ever at this restaurant after having lunch on a Sunday.  We ordered from the lunch menu. Paid the $19 bill with a $20 told the server to keep the change. She followed my husband and I to the door and said \"you know the bill doesn't include the tip\". We returned to the cashier and asked \"ok.. how much more, can we have a copy of our receipt\" the waiters mocked me and said \"how ever much more you need to know I get paid off tips and this wasn't enough\". I told her you don't ask for tips how rude of her and she told me your pregnant and I was pregnant once before too.. you need to tip me. It was awful she was so ignorant and to attack a customer and tell them how to spend their money, and to say what we offered was not enough for her. I took my cash back (the $3 I gave to the cashier) and left. So disrespectful! The management doesn't care! Oh and the food is good but this is the 3rd time we have had an issue at this place. One time we ate and got soo sick. Another time hair was in our food. The manager offered to replace the steak. She literally took the hair off the steak and had the cook reheat the same piece of meat. We paid the bill and left. The food isn't good enough for such poor service."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for Yelp, I would have never checked this place out. Authentic food. Good portions. Reasonable prices.   I had the spinach and cheese enchillada (I am not vegetarian and still found it to be delicious - would order again). Meals come with a side of beans and rice. Meal was about $8 and still had some leftovers. Mango frozen margarita was a little pricey at $10. Didn't expect it to be more than my meal. But it was delicious and the perfect amount of alcohol. Good (free) chips and salsa too!   Can be a little difficult to get in and out of the parking lot/strip mall where they are located, but don't let that deter you."}
{"text":"I came back again with my dinner group. This time the food was mediocre at best.  At the recommendation of my server I went with the burrito ranchera which was steak with onions and peppers rolled in a tortilla topped with cheese and served with beans and rice.  There was absolutely no flavor to this meal. All those Mexican spices that you come to love were missing and this tasted like something you'd get at a Mexican place in the upper Midwest. The beans were runny and not even their hot salsa which was actually medium could save it.  The best part of this meal was the chips and regular salsa. I may actually need to cross this one off of my list of decent Mexican places."}
{"text":"Salsa was fresh and amazing. They served 2 different kinds. Had the  vegetarian lunch burrito which was large, yummy and filling. Location is in a non descript shopping center but would definitely recommended stopping here if you are in the area."}
