{"text":"No they have moved to Greenwood and Danforth.  Anyhow, yes I have been ordering from them since 1996 or 1997.  Ya.  Their food comes fast and is always crispy and hot and delicious. They are courteous and professional.  Delish and convenient and reliable.  Could not ask for better!!!"}
{"text":"For the last snow storm of the year I felt like avoiding the stove and ordering in.

I had actually received the takeout menu for Red Rose back in 2008 but had never ordered from there. 

Since my mom came to visit (and she eats like Free Willy*) I decided to order the dinner for three plus two extra dishes or her, my husband and myself. 

Ordering was quick and easy, and I was happy that they took credit cards without me having to dictate my number over the phone. 

I ordered 3 egg rolls, chicken balls, pork fried rice, chicken chop suey, shanghai noodles, calamari (the tastiest of the order), and beef with vegetables which totaled $42. 

All in all for my snobby taste in Chinese food (I usually don't get caught dead eating chicken balls) the experience was good, the delivery lightning quick and the service super friendly.


*Just in case she reads this...she eats like free willy but is not the size of free willly. Yet."}
{"text":"First: they are NOT closed, but have moved.
Red Rose has decent Chinese Canadian cuisine, and I've been ordering from them for years. They have some of the best spare ribs you can find, and their minced pork with eggplant and garlic sauce is wonderful. More, if you're an oldtime3r and ask for the free fried rice with n order over $25, you get it."}
