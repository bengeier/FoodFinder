{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat in Mississauga, you really can't go wrong here. It's easy to miss if you don't know where it is, because its not really visible from the main street. My friend introduced it to me and I've been a convert since. I brought a couple friends from Montreal and they loved it so much they bought takeout to drive it all the way back to share with their wives. They said it's closest thing to the awesome food in Jamaica! My go to dishes here are the jerk chicken roti and jerk chicken dinner. 

You're welcome."}
{"text":"Shandra's serves me up the best rotis I've ever had! 

The jerk chicken roti is awesome, big peppercorns and a rich, dark jerk sauce. It's jerk heaven; which sounds more contradictory than the explosion of taste in your mouth with every bite that it is. 

The goat roti is amazing, the curry chicken roti is stuffed. Try them all, oxtail is a big seller if you dare. These are big meal rotis, be careful people!

The rotis themselves are soft and stretchy and it's really good bread, I'm drooling here just thinking about them.

The hot sauce is hands down the best I've ever had from a restaurant. Scotch bonnet and habanero puree with lime cutting through the extreme heat. So blisteringly good, and not for the faint of heart. I literally drown my roti in it.

The beef and chicken patties are spicy and delicious, and the shell is so perfectly soft. But good luck eating one if you are going to tackle the full roti. 

Everyone there is really sweet, and the place is always full at lunch, but it wanes by 1. Bonus points for spotting Rikki Jai, the Chutney Soca Monarch! (notwithstanding the syntactical contradiction of him being a male monarch.)

I...I think I'll have to go get one tomorrow."}
{"text":"The best bonesless jerk on rice and peas and the best roti in the city. 

The hot sauce is to die for. But HOT..!"}
{"text":"I haven't found any place that makes a jerk chicken roti like Shandra's in the GTA.  If somebody can point me to something even half as good, let me know!"}
{"text":"Casual and family run I think.  The food has home cooking written all over it.  It's sure to impress.  The jerk chicken has just the right kick.  The oxtail roti is perfectly savory.  Wow."}
{"text":"Visited this popular roti shop a few days ago. A word of warning, there are some crazy line ups during lunch time as this in an industrial area. Be prepared to get to know your table mate!

The service is extremely efficient with us getting our orders in a couple of minutes. We ordered chicken roti which comes wrapped in a pita like shell. The roti was excellent and the curry was not over powering even for a novice curry eater such as myself. The sauce they give you with the roti is a bit spicy so don't just dollop it on!

One issue I have is ordering and the menu.. There is no visible menu until you get to the cash and with 10 people behind you the last thing I want to do is rush through reading a menu. Something so easy..

Anyway this place is a must try for the west Indian foodie in you!"}
{"text":"Crowded lunch spot. 

Big line + poor operations management leave more to be desired.

Had the boneless chicken jerk roti. There were plenty of bones in it.

The roti itself was made from cornmeal or something- def. less enjoyable than Mother India or Ghandi. 

They keep all the reciepts on the counter and try to coordinate with the kitchen by walking back and yelling something every few orders. Mine ended up lost in the frey and took 15 minutes. Unhappy Kent.

For about $8 you can be pretty full after one of these. Since most of the orders are take out and people are taking their rotis back to work - they should be wrapping them in tinfoil rather than paper. It's cold within a few minutes.

TOO BAD, SHANDRA.

{"text":"Got take out. Amazing jerk chicken dinner. Stick to regular and if you want spice then get it on the side (it's super hot) I would say it's authentic jerk here. Stop by if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Today lunch was oxtail a large for about $12.00 
Potion was great for a big boy like me.
Meat was cook perfect rice was moist  very good
It was served with a thick gravy not bad and a coleslaw 
I would  of given a higher rating if it was Spicer while eating the  meal I heard customers  asking for hot and extra hot. My bad I don't know I had to tell them. 
Line up was out the door but they work fast 15min wait.
I have had better ox tail in Mississauga  so this is a fair rating."}
{"text":"Update: customer service is as bad as the food is good. These ladies look so miserable. I wonder what it would take for them to crack a smile. A good joke; a big tip, a glimpse of sunshine? 

They know their food is good, and they walk around as if they have the best in town. This is the rare exception where....... THEY DO.  

Updating my review as I recently tried their jerk chicken. The sauce was tasty, you can taste the scotch bonnet peppers, however the meat was dry. 

The oxtail remains king for me. I will try their roti and give a top 3 ranked update. 

Smile, Shandra :)"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for oh so delicious boneless Jerk Chicken Roti. Their other Roti's a good and the Jerk Chicken leg is also so good. But thats why the Jerk Chicken Roti is just the perfect mix of both worlds. I eat there at least once a week during lunch. Sooo good."}
{"text":"Well went here to try Jerk chicken with some coworkers and it was not a bad experience. 

The place itself is quite small and gets really busy during lunch time on weekdays but they have picnic tables outside which can be used on a pleasant day weather permitting. 

The server is quick to take order but the food comes out at a slower pace but its not too bad. The place was quite clean and kitchen also seemed clean from a distance as only one door was open. 


I ordered Jerk chicken in a roti. I have never head Jerk chicken in a roti so was not able to compare it to any other vendor. But when comparing to Jerk chicken on rice this was more sauce as there was nice amount of jerk sauce in the roti it self when you break it.  The chicken in the roti was cooked nice and was quite nice and enjoyable... but I still prefer my Jerk chicken with rice.

Till next time!"}
{"text":"Amazing roti & boneless jerk chicken, one of the best I've had in the GTA. 
The wait can be a bit long especially at peak times but it is all worth it! :)"}
{"text":"The food was really good. It's definitely worth going and it will be my go to jerk chicken place in Mississauga. The people weren't that friendly and there is no menu on the wall. But the good was awesome and fast"}
{"text":"I didn't particularly enjoy my first experience today at Shandra's. As it was my first time visiting, it wasn't a great feeling to be greeted by a frowning cashier who stood in front of a blank chalkboard where the menu items were supposed to be written. The only information that WAS presented to me was in the form of a sign that indicated that all of the prices went up in November, 2017 and another sign professing that their \"hot\" jerk is extremely hot and no refunds would be issued if you can't handle it. Oh and another sign that said Cash and Debit only! and another sign that said NO outside food allowed. Yes ma'am!

I opted for a large jerk chicken as I was sure it would be on the invisible menu. As suspected, the scowly cashier was miserable and mumbled further questions about my order such as if I wanted it hot or mild, etc. without breaking an iota of a smile or looking directly at me at any time.

After seating myself to wait, I decided I had better get a coke in case it was as hot as the sign made it out to be. I returned to the cash. \"$2.10\" she mumbled. \"$2.10 for a can of coke?\", I exclaimed, \"you're really overcharging for that considering the food you serve almost necessitates a drink.\" She said \"We sure are\". I then remembered that I wanted to try their famous hot sauce on its own so I asked for a side of hot sauce. She handed me a thimble's worth and mumbled \"quarter\". I said \"pardon\"?. She said \"It's a quarter\". I said you gotta be kidding me, and took my seat.

The food was ready in a very respectable amount of time. The quantity of food was acceptable for $11.00; 2 thighs, 1 drumstick, about a cup and a half of rice and peas and about a 1/4 cup of slaw. The jerk was simply doused in their vinegary hot sauce. So much so that the flavour of jerk was overpowered and minimal. The sauce itself was indeed hot but definitely does not require any of the warnings they have posted. It ain't that hot! The only other flavours that were able to penetrate through the hot sauce were more reminiscent of stew chicken as opposed to jerk, It would be my guess that this chicken hadn't ever seen any sort of open flame on any sort of grill. The rice n' peas were fine, but quite clovey and the slaw wasn't anything special.

I know that I'm in the minority with my negative review of Shandra's but I really think they could improve both the quality of their food and especially their customer service. Perhaps I should have read more Yelp reviews prior to my visit to see that I might have been better off ordering oxtail from their invisible menu."}
{"text":"Excellent quality.  Good portion of meat.  Very well seasoned.  Be careful of the hot sauce.  Very spicy so go easy with it.  It will make a Mexican cry."}
{"text":"Cousin introduced me to the jerk chicken here and it was pretty good! Only thing I could see a problem with is lack of parking space during rush hour. Pretty good for take out or quick dine in (but you will leave smelling like jerk chicken lol).

Jerk chicken  was super moist & has a good kick, curry chicken roti was also delicious. I do recommend getting the fried plantains, super yummy!"}
{"text":"Quick review:

After reading so many good reviews I decided to try this place out, and I am glad I did,
I had the boneless goat roti with the Hot sauce on the side

The breakdown

The curry goat was fantastic, 4/5
The Roti was good as well, 3/5
The Hot sauce, was HOT, 4/5

Customer service was good; they serve their food on China plates with stainless steal utensils (no paper and plastic business) 

The value was good as well it is little high than other Roti shops but worth it

Keep on Yelpin ****"}
{"text":"Shandra's roti is one of my faves in the West end.  I think they have the best goat roti in the GTA.  Their oxtail is one of the best in the West also.  I know they are fresh because I was told once I had to wait a bit extra because they are making fresh roti, which was worth the wait.  This is one of regular places for goat roti and oxtail."}
{"text":"Roti and chicken jerk here taste very good. the size of a combo portion is decent for the money you pay. definitely return when im around the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I had the curry chicken roti.  Busy place.  Only seats a few people but it was packed for lunch."}
{"text":"Good Roti and long lines pretty much sums up Shandra's. 

If you come during lunch, it's always busy. Good roti and limited seating makes for long lines and lots of take out orders. The first time I went I actually had to wait 15 minutes in line, and I was thinking \"this better be the best d@mn roti I've ever had\". Alas, it wasn't, but it's good and hits the spot when you're in the mood for some Caribbean cuisine.

The roti is good but compared to other Roti restaurants around the GTA it's not special. It is a great option if you want roti, as there aren't many places to grab roti in the immediate area and you won't be disappointed with the quality of the food.

The cost is about $8-10 for a roti, depending on what you get. I think the best roti they have there is the goat. They also have a jerk chicken roti which is interesting and it's also popular.  As something else mentioned, the \"boneless\" chicken may have one or two straggling bones left behind, but I've only found one bone in the two times I've had it.  Being roti, it's heavy and one roti will fill you up, unless you an abnormally large eater. 

One thing to note, they do close relatively early, I think around 7 pm so don't try this spot for dinner (on weekdays at least)."}
{"text":"This was my first time experiencing Caribbean Roti. It was pretty good! I had the Curry Chicken Roti. The flavors were nice, the meat was well trimmed (no big fatty chunks, etc.), and a single Roti was enough to keep me full all day long. It could have been a bit warmer (physical temperature), though. When I finally received my order, it was lukewarm at best. At that point I was pretty hungry and didn't make mention of it - which was my choice. But it would have been better hot. 

The shop is small, with limited seating, but was pretty busy at lunchtime on a Friday. The wait was a bit long because of this (also probably why my Roti was lukewarm). Shandra's is definitely popular with the locals, and I can see why. I would go back. Perhaps at a different time of day, to see if things were a little less crowded."}
{"text":"Cheap roti on Wednesday! So delicious! If you are grabbing takeout definitely order before arriving! Place gets packed quickly!! Great prices too"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and I always get the curry Chicken Roti. It's friggin delicious,and you get a good amount, all for 6.99. I hear their jerk chicken is good as well. 

This place gets really busy during peak lunch hours and seating is limited so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"dont let the worn out sign fool you. best roti in gta hands down. jerk chicken is average but every roti they make is amazing."}
{"text":"Our fav roti spot!! A hidden gem.  Food is always flavourful. Best to order for pick up."}
{"text":"Great roti.  Just had takeout from here and was a little apprehensive as my friend ordered me a boneless chicken curry rather than bone-in, which I find more softer and tastier. I was expecting a semi-dry chicken but was pleasantly surprised at how tender the chicken was! Yum!  

Immediately after opening the package, my nose was filled with a delicate aroma. I checked out the sauce and I was glad that it did not have an oily layer like some chicken curries have.  The hot sauce was indeed hot so make sure to mix it in. I dove right in and picked up a chicken with hot sauce on top.  The curry is great.  The roti was a bit thin and tasteless."}
{"text":"Hey. This is the first place where i tried Oxtail dinner, and it was just so super!
So close to what you get in jamaica. Jerk Chicken was also amazing like oxtail. Oxtail gravy had a sweet taste to it and jerk chicken had mild spices. Rice was made with beans and chicken stock. I would definitely go again. Food is expensive. Like the dinner combo costed 18 dollars."}
{"text":"As a Trinidadian visiting Canada for this first time, we wanted to get some Roti and decided to give Shandra's a try since it was close to us. Overall the experience was OK. We dined in, and while there wasn't a line when we ordered, as soon as we sat down the crowd really started coming in. We ordered 2 boneless goat Roti, and they were HUGE. They tasted really good, definitely had a lot of flavor and we added some slight pepper sauce (not Hot Sauce people, there is a difference). The only complaint I had was the way it was wrapped was not how I've ever had my Roti wrapped. It fell apart after a few bites and I had to use a knife and fork....lol and that has NEVER happened. Most Roti shops wrap their Roti in a little foil or paper so you can secure the contents until the end. Other than that, the food was good. I wouldn't hesitate to check it out again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"When I came to Toronto 20 odd years ago and lived at Yonge & Eligable, Alberts Real Jamican Food was my place to go for a Caribbean curry fix. Since those days I have been to many other places and can assure you that Shandra's is the real deal. The Jerk Chicken is sublime; crispy skin and fall off the bone meat (no knife required). I always ask for extra gravy on the rice&peas because it is just so friggen awesome. Shandra gets the spice mixture for the Jerk spot on, the best I have ever had. To top it off ask for it 'hot' and they will add some pepper sauce that will blow your mind - be careful this stuff is not for the feint of heart but it really hits the spot. 

Rotis are also good and Shandra is one of the few places that I know of that will provide a goat curry off the bone. 

The portions are huge and the prices reasonable. If you show up between 12 and 2 on a weekday be prepared to queue for about 10-20 minutes to order and get your food because this is a place where the food shines and people who work nearby clearly are in agreement with me on this one. 

Shandra you totally rock!"}
{"text":"It's a no frills type of place with too little parking (be prepared to park along the edge of the parking lot) with indoor and outdoor seating. You line up (sometimes really long) and order up at the cashier, pay then sit down and they'll bring it out to you. If you are eating in, let them know or it'll just be takeout boxes. 

I absolutely love their jerk chicken and ox tail dinner. About $14 after tax but good enough for 2 people. I'm actually salivating as I'm writing about it right now. Ask for spice because otherwise it won't be as good as I'm describing at the moment. It comes with rice and coleslaw as well. 

Their roti, beef patties and jerk chicken are all good, but the ox tail is where it's at! 

Go, and you won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Hot sauce!  Dayaam Hot. Loved it.  My large Ox wasn't so large so I will deduct a star.  But was ever so tasty. Know this, if you get take out and you want your food spicy you have to mention the spice level that you want it at. However, if you eat in , just ask for hot sauce and they will bring it to your table. But be aware, its got a kick to it.  Lol. My friend ordered the jerk chicken. I had a taste and found it to be very delicious. So delicious that I ordered another small jerk chicken for takeout.  I think this place has great tasting Ox Tail and Jerk Chicken. A must try of you are in the area."}
{"text":"Haven't actually tried the food. But the service was absolutely awful.

I walked into the shop when there were only 3 people waiting for their take out and the rest of the place was empty. 

No one was at the counter when I walked in.

When someone came out from the back kitchen, they did not acknowledge me (literally not even hi). The lady tried to punch in an order, but got confused, and two more people came out the back to help her. All three of them then continued to ignore me for the next 10 minutes. 

I left after that, I was excited to try the food but with this kind of service I will pass."}
{"text":"Had the curry goat roti, meat was nice and tender, extremely flavourful. However, I wish there was more meat in the roti. The large jerk chicken is amazing like always. Right amount of spicy sauce, which is extremely spicy btw! Their home made spicy sauce is made with scotch bonnet peppers. Ask for a small amount on the side and add sauce yourself to your meal."}
{"text":"This place has been a local favourite of mine for many years! Good quality home style cooking and the roti is awesome! I always get the Channa one and sometimes I get some doubles. 

Friendly staff great food and quick service! Can't go wrong here!!!"}
{"text":"I'm no an expert on Caribbean food but I've had my share, and shandra's is definitely on my top list to go to when I'm craving jerk chicken or some curries. Portions and price point are great compared to some downtown Toronto restaurants. I only wish they opened on Sunday's or later on weekends so I had more opportunity to get my fix. 

I usually get the jerk chicken dinner (photo posted). The Chicken is juicy and tender, the marinate is well balanced/not over seasoned, and the sides of peas rice and coleslaw complement the dish perfectly. I've been fairly often, and shandra is consistent with quality. 

Definitely won't be my last visit"}
{"text":"Amazing jerk chicken. .perfectly spicy and so tasty,friendly staff ,definitely would come back.."}
{"text":"Service BITES.
Grumpy at the counter.
Gave me the wrong order, kissed her teeth at me for her f$ck up..   Fridge with drinks is luke warm, either broken or too lazy to make colder.
Asked politely for some hot sauce, ignored me and forgot.
Horrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrible staff or owner that day, too bad.. food was good, SHI# service isn't worth returning ever again.
I can get treated poorly for much cheaper and closer to home.."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really great. I am a huge fan of their oxtail roti. (If you do order it and eat it in one sitting, prepare to be full for the next 24 hours. You will feel satisfied and maybe a little pregnant.) My friends have ordered oxtail, curry chicken and jerk chicken during our visits. They really enjoyed it. The restaurant is very small and gets very busy during peak times, so  either go early or make sure to order ahead if you go. The price was very reasonable - around $20 for a full meal and drink. 

The \"complaints\" that I have are pretty minor. One, they could stock up on their side dishes more. I'm never able to buy plantain there. Two, their heating system is rather interesting. In the fall/winter, it tends to get pretty cold unless you sit under the heater - then you're sweating. 

Some other reviews mentioned the poor attitude of the servers/workers, but that is typical of a Caribbean restaurant. I, however, had no problems with the staff. They were very kind and friendly towards me. (Then again, I did visit with some regulars.)

If you're ever in the area, I would recommend checking out Shandra's. It's a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"LOVE IT. Defintely worth a 20min-30min drive. 
The ladies preparing the food are a little pushy, but what can you expect.
The young woman behind the cash was very kind and explained the menu to us. 

Love the roti, love the pholories, great dessert and drink options.

Cant wait to come back. Best in Toronto"}
{"text":"On any lunch hour expect to be waiting in line at shandra's. This place doesn't mess around. With a variety of rotis, rice dishes and carribean appetizers, you can't leave without being satisfied. 

Shandra's menu has your basic chicken, goat and beef, but on certain occasions they'll have different treats like kingfish, snapper and stews. 

In my opinion the jerk chicken dinners at shandra's are the best I've ever had. The only complaint is that sometimes the chicken is kind of dry depending on the time of day you order.  

The rotis here are humungous. They're about the same size as half of a cinder brick. Fill that up with potato filling and your choice of meat (or no meat) and you've got the single best tasting 2 pound lunch you've ever had. 

Unfortunately shandra's is only open for lunch so be sure to get there before 12 to beat the rush."}
{"text":"Best Roti hands down. Not only was the jerk chicken flavourful and not to spicy but the shell was incredible. The service was great and very fast. I recommend and definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"One of the best Roti Shop on the east coast of Canada,Food is delicious and fairly prices for the portion size ..For a man of my size 6'5 300 lbs my belly is full and im ready to sleep after ."}
{"text":"The Curry Chicken Roti (CCR) was awful. 

It tasted like... If a white person who couldn't handle spicy food and had never cooked West-Indian food thought they would take a whack at cooking West-Indian food, but happened to be trying really hard to do the opposite of Emeril Lagasse by un-BAMming the flavor as much as possible... The CCR was so unpleasant that it made me write that run-on sentence. 

West Indian cuisine in my past experiences involved strong, and rich flavors. Shandra's Roti Shop however had a CCR that was all kinds of bland, unpleasant, and boring (while also being mildly offensive in how boring it was). 

And it wasn't just me who struggled with this thing. Four people attempted to get through one order of CCR. And we all tried to get someone else to finish it. Because if you don't know, many Indians have a weird aversion to throwing food away, even food that doesn't taste great. So instead we try to pawn it off on someone else so as to assuage any guilt about food-wastage. 

But the CCR started with me, and came full-circle after I initially pretended that it was \"... not that bad, but it's just not my thing.\" I even tried to get my 11-month old to eat some of it in the hopes that he would enjoy it (because it had a certain baby-food quality to it), but his facial expressions were more honest than I was when I initially tried it. But I forced myself to finish it, with each painful bite consisting of a mushy, stringy, diet-masala-esque, mushy, mush-mush. MUSSSHHHH.

But... the little bit of the roti that wasn't a slimy mess because it hadn't soaked up the watery, bland, mushy, chicken curry; that part was decent though. So yay for those two or three bites of non-mushy grossness. Regardless, this one experience has killed any desire for me to want to try anything else from Shandra's. 

P. S. My wife, who had picked up the food for me also just informed me that the lady was rude. Sooooo... A big 'ole pile of nope."}
{"text":"Awesome roti's and full dinner plates! The rotis are huge, enough for two even. Very good deal with a great selection including seafood choices including king fish, snapper and shrimp.
The place isn't huge; many tables for 4. Vegetarian choices including chana, potato rice and peas."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 4 years and can say this place is just going down the hill. The food quality and taste is just not there any more. The customer service was meh to begin but the food was great that made me keep going back and back but I will officially not be going back."}
{"text":"Best place to get authentic Caribbean food! The rotis are great! The chicken dinners are delicious and huge! Even the coleslaw is amazing! Every time I come here I am NEVER disappointed! Just make sure you come early, it gets pretty busy!"}
{"text":"Amazing Rotis! I ordered the jerk chicken roti. It was the right amount of spice. I thought it would be dry but it was not.
They have some space to eat there too. But it's more of a takeout place."}
{"text":"Absolute fiyahhh! When I say fiyahhh, I actually mean the food is insanely delicious and the hot sauce will make you sweat buckets. 

My go to's are the large jerk chicken dinner and goat roti. Seriously, can't go wrong. 

If you're a vegetarian, they got potato curry roti. Also dope AF and less than $6 compared to +$11 for goat roti. Hot sauce for 25 cents if you order it to go and free for dine in."}
{"text":"Best roti I've ever had. Loved the goat roti.
Hotness level can get to crazy, definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Very good jerk chicken. Not too spicy too. Crowded during lunch, but you can always head over to the other location (walking distance) around the corner. For about $8-12 you will be pretty full."}
{"text":"Just had the goat roti and wow this place knows what they are doing. The food can be spicy but that depends on your tolerance of spice. 

If you haven't tried this place yet you should soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to takeout. I wouldn't dine there as it looks kind of run down. Lunch rush - parking is terrible, so go before or after.
The food itself isn't bad. I've ordered their Jerk Chicken dinners + their Curry Chicken double. Both are tasty. I personally enjoy lots of spice, so it would be nice if they were both spicier (I did ask for extra spicy). I found it mild at best. They were full of flavour, just lacked the spice I crave.

I would come here again though, just not on a weekday."}
{"text":"Plain, simple, perfectly filling, delicious Roti. I got the curry goat and it was nothing more or less than I expected. But beyond worth the price."}
{"text":"If you're ever in the area, or simply craving West Indian food, Shandra's is an excellent choice. Being of West Indian descent, I can say that this place offers authentic roti and curry.

I've always ordered the Chicken Curry Roti with a Cream Solo or Peardrax. Solo pop and Peardrax are both widely circulated in the Carribean so I recommend trying! If you can tolerate spice, ask for the roti spicy (but beware... it's quite hot). The roti itself is quite big - most people tackle it with the plastic knife and fork but it can also be eaten as a wrap.

There isn't much space inside so you may have to grab it as take out. I recommend visiting before 12 so that you can beat the lunch rush. There is limited parking and the wait can be quite long if there is a line."}
{"text":"If 4.5 is an option, I would totally give them that. Im happy that I work less than 10 minutes away so if Im lucky enough, I would be in and out in a few minutes. That is, if I were to call in around 30 minutes before I pick it up. The place is tiny so its not surprising to see  a line up when you go around lunch time.

The quantity of the people is a sign of the quality of the food. So far I've only had the jerk chicken and the curry chicken and oh my goodness are they aaahhmazing! The chicken is fall of the bones and the spices....oh the spices! Just a quick warning: the curry chicken is only mildly hot but the jerk chicken can be quite too much if you're not big on spicy stuff. Even with the help of the coleslaw. Speaking of, their coleslaw is quite different from other coleslaws I've tried. It seems more vinegar-based? It does help in cooling off the jerk sauce, but not really by a lot.

Will definitely recommend it to friends and coworkers. Ill just warn them to go at a not so busy time to avoid line ups."}
{"text":"This place sucks, dont know what else to say, only people who never enjoyed good caribbean food would like this place."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food here. I tried the curries, the buss up, the jerk. Over all, it's good flavours, good pricing, good value.


To me though, it's definitely not a 4.5 start joint. There is better roti and curry out there in the GTA. I found however the spice level is really strong here (not hotness, but mixture and amount of spice). This can be a bit of an issue if you have any sensitivities. Again, it's also a matter of taste."}
{"text":"The food: I am a really picky eater and I basically hate every type of curry ever.. or so I thought. I am in love with Shandra's rotis. They are SO SPCIY AND SO GOOD! I feel like they have single handedly opened expanded my palette and now I am much more open to try food with curry in it. I dont even live in Missisauga but I trek out here just to get this roti. 

Portion size: The portion sizes are great for the price, I usually eat it in two meals because it's a too big for me.

Warning: it is truly very spicy!! Do not ignore the signs haha. 

Wait time: If you come during lunch hour, be ready for a line-up and semi-long wait. A lot of people call in advance and order so it is ready for them to pick up. There are tables inside if you want to actaully sit down ad eat though. 

Parking: The parking is along the outsides of the shops there and I have never not been able to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"okay, let me just say !! hooray!!! a place in Mississauga with affordable Caribbean cuisine.

so I heard about this place through my friends sister and her boyfriend, so yesterday I was craving my oxtail, which I usually do at least once a month. I decided to stop by before I head to work, I checked the website and was happy to see the prices on there. 

I ordered the large oxtail and a  can of coke and it only cost me $15.00(the regular place I go to this would be $22.00) so this is definitely a savings. 

The portion for the large was great, I was able to eat some before I started work and save half for lunch, so It was definitely a deal! 

I ordered take out, but the place was small and not much lighting. It really is best for take out, I will for sure be coming back for more and can't wait to bring my friends and family to this place."}
{"text":"Just simple whole hearty carribean food.  The jerk chicken dinner is just full of flavour and is worth going back for.  Don't forget the roti.  Not good for sit down so pickup and go."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot, very fast service and tasty food. I always get the channa roti wrap!"}
{"text":"Was on my to try list from yelp.
Busy little spot, but seemed to get people through as a reasonable pace.
I got the boneless chicken roti. The portions are good, was definitely full afterwards. I found there was less chicken inside than other places. 
Enjoyed the spice.
Overall I would most definitely go back to try some other menu items and would recommend a try."}
{"text":"I went to Shandra's Roti Shop recently based on a few recommendations. I also went in almost right when they opened at around 11:10 because I read here that wait times could be really long during peak hours. I'm not a big roti fan so I opted for the jerk chicken dinner. It was very good and a little different than Jamaican style jerk chicken as this was a Trinidadian place. I actually preferred this. The portion was massive as well and left me very full. The wait time to get my food was only about 10-15 minutes and I enjoyed a fresh beef patty while I waited. The total for the jerk chicken with rice and peas and the beef patty came to 13 dollars on the dot. Very reasonable. The lady who took my order was also very friendly. The location is the only issue I can see. It's in a bit of a weird area and the plaza it's in is also very small. Still the food was great."}
{"text":"Just popped in for lunch today and I'm so glad I did. OMG the curry roti is probably the best I have ever had, and I frequent many roti shops being on the road for work daily. I got it with the hot sauce in it, if you don't like Hot don't order it. My brother got the jerk chicken but he wasn't sure if it was the best but he loved it all the same. He thought it was a bit on the saucy  side. He said it had some sneaky heat that showed up after he was all done. Rice and peas had some zip to it too. Very good food, we just beat the lunch rush. We will keep this place in the rotation for sure."}
{"text":"So I jus paid and got to my car bag felt light so I looked inside. 
I ordered buss up shot w oxtail. They didnt have any buss up shot so I opted for the oxtail roti but not wrapped. 
FYI for anyone going there, if you're set on a certain item calk ahead unless your willing to choose something else...the lady at the front said they haven't had buss up shot for a while now . Yet it remains on the menu(clearly they just wanted yo lure me there lol)  
Anyway I Paid about 11$ . I got a small round container of oxtail(counted 4 pieces )  with a spoon full of curried potatoes , which I assumed was to go in the roti w the oxtail. 
The oxtail was amazzzzing , I'm actually going to say the best I've had. A bit more oil and less gravy then I preferred but nonetheless full of flavour, not too spicy or overly sweet like Jamaican spots :) 
Potatoes I could hve done without , nothing special . I definitely wish you got more bang for your buck but you know what they say quality over quantity *rolls eyes*
Customer service is cool and collective ..the girl at the front was attentive and patient. 
I also got two chicken patties and two kola champagne drinks for later ..they didn't hve any beef patties left which was kind if weird because they're open until 7 and it was about 130pm. The chicken ones were pretty good though tasted like curry chicken to be honest. 
So overall I will definitely be back cause I mean drooool..maybe I'll get it with rice &peas next time ...the pictures w rice look like they hve more meat"}
{"text":"Our team goes out for lunch each Friday. Last Friday, we were supposed to visit Shandra's. Instead, my manager and I decided to check it out a week earlier, as we were in Waterloo for work that day.

I basically left work a couple of Fridays ago at around 5:15 pm. I asked whether he'd like to tag along. He was game.

I drove us over to Shandra's. It is on the northwest corner of Maingate and Eglinton. 

The parking lot is super busy and there aren't a ton of spots. Luckily, I found a spot and we walked in.

I wanted to give the oxtail a try, so I ordered the large size. It had yummy oxtail in a delicious sauce, rice and peas, and coleslaw. There was a lot of rice and peas, so I had to spread out eating it for a couple of meals. The coleslaw was the vinegar type, which worked well. Yummy!

My manager bought the chicken roti. He said that it was smaller than he had hoped, but that it was flavourful. The roti had chick peas inside, which is how I like it.

We both did takeout. We sat there and waited for our orders. One customer was really chowing down, which was refreshing to see.

Everyone is nice. When our orders were done, the woman manning the counter brought our food to us. It was a nice touch.

There was some driver who was parked just behind me. It wasn't a parking spot, so I had to take my time trying to get out of my spot. He finally got the message and moved. 

I'd come back to give the roti a go.

{"text":"Very authentic and very spicy.  Had pretty big portions with our orders, mainly because of the large amount of rice we got.  The jerk chicken was spiced at the right heat, but the hot sauce you have to be careful... it will burn."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a sketchy strip mall on Eglington in Mississauga is the best Roti Shop in the West end! (I can personally attest to having full out 3am cravings for this place). 

The rotis are huge and made fresh to order in Chicken, Goat, Beef, etc.. for about $7 each. 

Although they don't deliver you can call ahead for pickup or drop by and wait (literally) 3 minutes for your order. 

I highly recommend it...be prepared for a total food coma!!!"}
{"text":"The roti is Hugh. ...Price is reasonable.   3rd time here...jerk chicken roti is 9 out of 10."}
{"text":"Great selection of both bn-in and bnls meats, I'm not used to bnls goat! Jerk roti was delightful. Highly recommend this restaurant.. Although don't go at peek lunch time as the line was out the door, despite this our order was served fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Outside sign looks torned and old but I gotta say foods here are fantastic!  

We ordered Ox tails, goat, jerk chicken with rice and all of them were tender and tasty! My parents are picky eater but they were enjoying them.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The best jerk chicken in the GTA. The place is small and a bit dated but the food is delicious. 

They get pretty busy quickly so call in for your order and pick it up without waiting.

Highly recommended. 

P.S. Will be trying their rotis soon."}
{"text":"This is the real deal for roti in Peel region. Don't do what I did, take out and try to eat in the car. You need both hands to ear these awesome roti sandwiches.

Get spicy at your own risk! It's HOT. No joke.

You know a roti place is a fe' real' when the Trinis, Guyanese, Jamaicans and every islander comes for the food.

Will enjoy these bad boys again!"}
{"text":"We come here quite often for their superb oxtail on rice and beans.  Very tasty indeed! What we like a lot about the oxtail is that they have lots of flavourful gravy on the rice.   Their small is $9 and large is $11.  We usually take the large size as we can pack the rest and still savour it again for the remainder portion of it at home.  Haha.  That's how much we like it!  Watch out for their hot sauce though!  Through the roof hot!  But still good to add a few drops on.  

It is just a small cafe style restaurant.  Lots of local Caribbean type drinks too.  

Their goat and chicken curry roti is also a popular favourite.  Generous portions.  Beef patties are also sold here.  

We always get a craving at least once every couple of weeks to come here.  Eating now!  Yum!"}
{"text":"I had the small jerk chicken with rice and beans. A small was more than enough for me for lunch.  Chicken had a bit of a kick and it comes with a sauce that when mixed with rice made the whole meal even better.  The coleslaw was also great. It's sweet and doesn't have a lot of mayo which is what I prefer.  Will definitely come back to try their oxtail with rice and beans."}
{"text":"I have been going for years here when Shandra herself was the server and owner, she has now passed the business to her daughters who are running it successfully. I ordered the goat roti and added more goat for $2.00 and extra gravy. It was so delicious with very little fat in the goat. The goat was tender and not tough. The gravy was thick and rich. My wife got the boneless chicken roti which was also fabulous. Fellow Yelpers if you ever in the Dixie and Eglington area, you must visit. The lunch hour Can be a bit of wait, so order ahead. It is located in a small plaza off Maingate and Eglington."}
