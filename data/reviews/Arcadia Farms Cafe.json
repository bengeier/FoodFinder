{"text":"Food and service are excellent! The restaurant is charming and we will definitely return. The menu is so inviting, I'm making a reservation for May and taking a friend for her birthday, so we can try more of the wonderful offerings. Our server was delightful and efficient. She easily answered every question and always came to the table with a friendly smile and attitude. The only reason I did not give Arcadia a 5-star rating, is that the tables for two are too small, too small for the healthy array of food that two people order!"}
{"text":"Went with the ladies for brunch on Wednesday. The place is quite charming, and we sat outside, on the patio facing the street,under a big tree. The setting was lovely and the  slight breeze made sitting outside a very pleasant experience. Our waitress, we all agreed, was friendly, attentive, and went the extra mile to make our dining experience a very enjoyable one. The food is well prepared, fresh, and very delicious. Two of us ordered the spinach, mushroom and goat cheese tart--it was better than good. We would have it again. The breakfast quesadilla was also very good. Fresh fruit is served with must of the breakfast entrees.The lemon cake was light and had the right amount of lemon in it, plus it wasn't too sweet. There is a market across the street where you can purchase the baked goods. We would all come back here again for the food, atmosphere, and good service. We found the prices fair and not overpriced at all."}
{"text":"A friend and I agreed that this was one of the finest brunches we have ever enjoyed. We each ordered crepes, which were divine and then shared a leek mushroom tart. The berry crepes were our favorite between the crepes, stuffed with mascarpone cheese and topped with fresh berries. The tart was out of this world. The crust was perfectly flaky and made with real butter for a rich flavor. Everything tasted like high cuisine that was made with love!"}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms is the best! My company hosted a luncheon here yesterday in the elegant wine room and it was the perfect location. We were served by Penny, who did an outstanding job with everything we needed. She was extremely friendly, attentive, and made sure everything ran smoothly. I couldn't have done it without her! And of course, the food was amazing. Everyone raved about their selections and I'm sure we'll all be back again! It was a great time."}
{"text":"Had an incredibly tasty salad here the other day.  It was a daily special -- coconut shrimp, mango, raspberries, etc.  Fab food, super setting.  Very nice lunch for the ladies!  Also, beautifully refreshing iced tea.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST IN TOWN! Organic farm fresh eggs, local chicken apple sausage and  delicious unsweetened peach ice tea for a mere $11.50 in this beautifully elegant yet unpretentious place.  Debbie's friendly and efficient patio service could not have been better & encouraged our return 2 days in a row while visiting Scottsdale this week. What a charming gem! Looks like it should be in Laguna Beach charging $25 for the same food. If birds freak you out, eat inside this quaint home/restaurant. Many GF options and outstanding coffee (no bitterness)."}
{"text":"We had lunch and truly enjoyed our salads and quesadillas. The ambiance is fantastic. It is like sitting in a quaint cottage with outdoor porch seating. Certainly a gem in the midst of big restaurants."}
{"text":"We're over for Spring Training, staying in Scottsdale and needed a place to eat before a game.  Since Arcadia Farms is within walking distance of the hotel and got such great reviews, we decided to give it a try......it was a great idea!  My mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart was fabulous and the accompanying green salad was very good , though a bit overdressed for my taste.  My husband had the ham sandwich with split pea and ham soup, and even though he could find no ham in the soup, it was quite tasty and the sandwich was delicious.

We had no time for dessert, so we ordered a Baby Coconut Cake to go.   Quite frankly, it was to die for!  Plus, it was enough for 3 people, though the 2 of us sacrificed and finished it!

If you find yourself in Scottsdale, give this place a try.  Neither a quick nor inexpensive choice, it nonetheless was a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Loved the country chic decor, ambiance and the food!  Came here for Sunday brunch with my sister (who's a foodie) and absolutely loved it.  Looking forward to coming back here and trying different dishes.  The Marketplace across the street is also awesome for those times I don't feel like cooking, but want a high quality and tasty light meal.

I would recommend this place for an elegant brunch!"}
{"text":"MAKE RESERVATIONS!! Wish the post would have mentioned that front and center. This is a swanky place....did not eat here, but looks great."}
{"text":"This is a lovely place for brunch or lunch. The atmosphere is relaxed. Reservations is a must. We had an anniversary brunch there recently and everything was wonderful. Went back this week for a girls out brunch and was disappointed. Our server was very confused and got most of our orders wrong. The lemonade was almost all ice. The food is tasty but our mushroom goat cheese tarts came out slightly warm and were mainly filled with large slices of leeks. They close at 3 pm but never rushed us. Would try it again."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and beautiful ambiance! And the desserts are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Always great.  Menu could have a few more items.

Great atmosphere ans not a factory restaurant.   Service is exceptional"}
{"text":"Food is great, the restaurant is adorable, and there is outdoor seating in back. I would recommend going for Sunday brunch and getting a carafe of Sangria to share with the table."}
{"text":"This place is simply the CUTEST! My husband stumbled upon it while looking at places to go for my birthday weekend when we were in town and I'm so glad he found this gem. The food was amazing, the tea was fresh and delicious and the atmosphere was just so wonderful and exactly the kind of place I love. 
Order a Baby Cake from their dessert menu- they make them in house- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I work just around the corner and the smells that come from this place are so heavenly.  Every Friday morning I get a whiff of the delicious pastries as I walk into my office.  I think I have tried every one of their pastries but the Pecan cinnamon roll and the lemon cookie are my favorites.  Their salads (for when I'm being good) are also very filling.  Huge portions.  I usually split them into lunch and dinner.  The dressings are made not bought.  Luckily I've dropped down to working just one day a week because my pants were about to pop at the seams.  Oh and the staff is always in a good mood.  Very friendly.  They usually have discounted pastries after 2pm."}
{"text":"Service horrible- I was charged a $61.00 tip on a $53.00 takeout order and when I called to report... they said that often times the bank (American Express) will add on what they feel is an appropriate tip! But that they would get back to me right away... Manager was in a \"meeting\" and she was the only one who could help me...  Guess what? 2 weeks later no call and when I called back, same girl \"Abby\" gives me the same story! Should've just reported them to American Express to start with! I will never order anything from them, even when a client requests. Lettuce on the pesto shrimp salad was LIMP anyway!"}
{"text":"Debbie is the BEST server! Food is amazing but dessert is even better! Lemon cookies are my all time favorite. Tuna sandwich and strawberry chicken salad are where it is at! Can't go wrong! Def a place for girls, mothers day, baby shower, wedding shower, etc.."}
{"text":"Less than impressed! After we were seated our waitress came to take our order twice and we weren't quite ready and ask her to give us a few more minutes, about 40 mins later she finally came to take our order and we waited almost 45 min for our food, there was only three of us. I had the breakfast panini and it was lukewarm to cool with not a lot of flavor, the bacon on it was really good though!! End result-poor service and fair food!!
Went next door to their Marketplace and it was super cute and very nice lady working, they had tables outside, wish we would've gone in here instead!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, but horrible, stuffy and pretentious atmosphere.  Showed up for late lunch & was greeted by a completely self-absorbed young girl who has clearly never received training in customer service.  The place was nearly empty and she asked (with a bored blank stare) if we had a reservation.  When we said no, she huffed and acted very put off.  Once we were seated, the service was so terrible that we left before eating our meal.  Have dined here multiple times.  Just cannot take the poor service and generally stuffy, \"wealthy grandmother\" like atmosphere any longer."}
{"text":"I was very surprise on how spectacular our meals where. The quality of locally source organic products really places this little restaurant in another level in comparison to others. Word of caution, if you want to sit inside, make a reservation! Although, sitting under the old pine tree in the rear courtyard was quite enjoyable and a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon!"}
{"text":"I took a client there for lunch today.  I called first thing this morning to make a reservation for 11:00 a.m. (and they are open for breakfast so should have taken the call) and had to leave a voice mail.  No one called me back within an hour and a half, so I called again and this time someone by the name of Raphaele (female - not sure of spelling) answered.  I told her I had left a message but hadn't heard back, so she took all of my information and said I had a reservation for 11:00 a.m. as requested. My client arrived before me a few minutes prior to the appointment time, asked if there was a reservation under my name, and she said there was no reservation under my name. The person at the front seated her and when she asked for a different table because the one she was given was tiny, she was told that it will get very busy inside and the only other option was outside.  The restaurant was practically empty.  When I arrived and was also told no reservation existed under my name.  She was very nonchalant when I explained I had called earlier and was given a reservation.  This is very bad customer service, especially since this was a business lunch and I would have liked to have made a better impression.  The goat cheese dip is delicious but my Pesto Shrimp Salad had very chewy and overcooked shrimp in it.  I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Quaint little restaurant in a converted home. Good service, good coffee, had the breakfast quesadilla and it was delicious. Large portion could easily have split and gotten one other smaller item to round out the breakfast. I would like to come back and try their French toast options, as well as their lunch menu. They have a store next door that sells ready made items as well, food appears to be local."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday with my friend and our daughters. The patio was very nice, as usually. They don`t take same day reservation but we were seated quickly.
The atmosphere is very nice and the food as well. We wait a little bit longer for our orders but it wasn`t that bad.
My surprise came today when I saw in my bank statement a different amount and the manager told me that their machine pre-authorized all the transactions with 20% more and in couple of days I`ll see the right amount.
I can live with that but I don`t think it is right and every body should know about it and check their statement."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to trying this place! The ambience was great - lots of outdoor seating, old cottage style house - and the service was amazing!
Unfortunately, the food seemed to be hit or miss. The wild mushroom tart and berry crepe were both excellent and I would highly recommend them! However, two of us ordered the breakfast cobbler and were disappointed by the lack of flavor. 
I would go back for the mushroom tart!!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place to come for lunch or breakfast especially when it is \"patio weather\". I had a great time here with my friend yesterday. We came around lunch time and were seated right away. We got a great table in the shade.The weather couldn't have been more ideal. Thank god fall is here! I understand that the restaurant gets extremely busy during the weekend.The restaurant itself is very pretty and the service was fantastic.

I went with a friend who loves to eat (but you wouldn't know it by looking at her)...(I know...if she weren't so great I might have to hate on her! Just kidding!)We decided to split a couple of appetizers and an entree. We had the crab tower with avocado-pretty fantastic, the brie cheese plate, and we split a shrimp pesto salad. Everything was very delightful! We also split a chocolate toffee cookie at the very end. We were at the restaurant for a couple of hours as we had a lot of catching up to do.

This is a beautiful venue and they have private rooms and we also found out that the owners house which is right next door is available for events. The yard/courtyard was very beautiful and lush.

All in all a fantastic lunch and I hope to go there for brunch in the near future,"}
{"text":"Fabulous food and Abiance My husband and I sat outside  in the atrium The service superb 
Only disappointment No free Babycake!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has an extraordinarily cute atmosphere, and luckily the weather was great and we could be outside, but the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Recently went here for brunch/breakfast. Service was top notch, food was great. No complaints. I hadn't been here in a while and after my recent experience I'm really questioning why not.....Only strange thing was they had told us there was going to be a short wait of 10-15 mins, then just a few minutes later we were seated and there was a bunch of open tables where we were seated."}
{"text":"Delicious and charming. The menu is perfect...I thoroughly enjoyed brunch. The service was wonderful. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience....made reservation many weeks in advance (and confirmed several days beforehand) to host a small luncheon shower....as we were coming from across the country for this event, we stopped in the day before to confirm table location, etc.....we were shown 3 tables that we might have but we could not reserve a specific table (as we were told that there were 200 reservations and that if it rained the restaurant would be very crowded)....on the day of the shower we were offered a table in the main path between rooms and next to the door to the women's rest room (where we later realized that a line forms)...we persisted and ultimately received a better table....it was not raining and during the couple hours that we were at the restaurant, it never appeared to be 3/4 full......while the web site and Facebook indicate lunch 11-3 (and we had printed \"lunch\" on our invitations and program cards), as we were about to sit down with our guests at 11:15, we were told that only breakfast would be served until 12:00....food was good, waitress was pleasant, and cake was spectacular."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food, but our lunch (two salads and a roasted chicken sandwich) took almost two hours. They didn't seem to care either, I'm just sayin."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale only 2 days and found this gem on the first morning.  Though I usually like to try something new each day, Arcadia Farms Cafe was so splendid that we ate there both mornings.  The food was fresh and delicious.  The setting was delightful.  We highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dining here for lunch.  I had a salad that was very fresh.  It was a good portion without being excessive.  Our server was very nice and kept our drinks filled.  I was able to find free parking nearby."}
{"text":"Mother, may I? This place is delicious!

We started with the warm brie & caramelized apples.... so good. My hubs is a cheese connoisseur (that or he just eats A LOT of cheese) and he even raved about how good the brie was.

I then had the warm chopped veggie salad --- mouth watering and flavorful! The hubs had the crab cakes - of which I snagged more than one forkful. Those too were delicious.

The atmosphere is adorable - cozy, like a friend's home. The service was great as well - if you are looking to grab a bite for lunch in Old Town, you gotta stop here."}
{"text":"review is 3.5 stars

Came here for lunch because Cafe Monarch was closed for the day.  The atmosphere was excellent, all these little rooms and an outdoor patio in back and seating on the street as well.

I had the warm chicken salad, very fresh & tasty.  Hubby had a bowl of soup, butternut squash, that was very good.  Then he had the grilled salmon which was good, not great.

For being so busy, the service was still very good.

What brings this down for me to 3.5 instead of 4 stars is the price.  Very expensive for what you get.  My salad was $15 and the other entree was $16 or $17 and the piece of salmon was very small."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to sit outside and enjoy a tasty breakfast. If you don't have time to have sit down meal, pop next door and grab a strawberry scone. Warning they are addicting!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere makes you feel like you're dining at grandma's house.  Don't be in a rush, and enjoy the time dining."}
{"text":"I was SO EXCITED to try this place. We went today, Monday at noon, my fiancé, toddler and I. More than half of the restaurant was empty but as soon as she saw that we had a baby, she claimed to only have tables available outside because they were \"full\" of reservations. 
The hostess was a terrible actress, there weren't even reservations on the list in front of her. They should just put on the door that kids aren't welcome. 

Very rude, will not be back."}
{"text":"One word, AWESOME! They cater the lunches at my work and it is the best part of my day. Everything is fresh and delicious and you can taste the quality. If you haven't tried AF, you are missing out. A must try for lunch or anytime!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent, the food is fabulous! The carrot cake is the best in town! If you haven't been, go!!?"}
{"text":"The Arcadia Farm Cafe is a quaint little restaurant. It has possibilities but the potatoes in my potato salad were under cooked. The waitress was not too pleasant and either over worked or just very slow. As others have said it appears to be a ladies place with only two men vs 30 women when we visited. In fact one of the new waitresses didn't even know where the men's room was. I hope this place reaches its full potential because it has many
Positives."}
{"text":"ive been here several times, and half the time the service is really bad but the other half i couldnt ask for better service. maybe its hit or miss. the food is ridiculously amazing, and their apricot iced tea  . . . i crave all day. overall, the food is so good that if you ever get bad service, it doesnt really matter. mos def a good place to take mother in laws for lunch!"}
{"text":"Sister and I split turkey, brie sandwich and strawberry salad. Salad needed more dressing. Sandwich was scrumptious.  Husband had Cobb salad. Asked for a different dressing. Little scones were wonderful.  Service perfect. Would go again for sure."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants. The food is always great but what surpasses it is the location and overall ambiance. We sat on the patio and it was gorgeous. The server gave two old friends time to catch up and never hurried us along. I wish they were opened for dinner but regardless this is a great place for a relaxing lunch."}
{"text":"I would recommend not coming here during the summer. We sat outside and the misters were not misting the tables at all, but the street instead. The wait to sit inside was 30+ minutes so we opted to sit on the patio, which would be amazing Oct-April, but not so much when its over 100 degrees outside. The service was decent, but when it came time to get the check our waiter was nowhere to be found for over 30 minutes (we had to ask another waitress to find him). My berry crepes were pretty good but I probably wouldn't order them again. Overall an OK experience but I'll sit inside next time I'm here!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's a go to whenever.  Met some folks there today that I have not seen in years .  Food, as usual was great.  They loved it too.  Only 2 problems...sat there for way too long before a server came to see if I wanted any drink...like a good 20 minutes.  We did stay there a long time catching up but they were not busy.  Only once did anyone ask about coffee or water refill.  And the weekend brunch menu says they have an omelet bar...nope.  I will go back tho,maybe even next weekend."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch on the patio mid-week in a pleasant neighborhood.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Omelette and other choices were out of the ordinary so it wasn't the same old things.  Hint-- if you want an espresso drink, get one before you sit down for brunch at their cafe across the street.  Or go their afterwards and try one of the fine desserts too."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Arcadia Farms, I like to engage in a little fantasy (totally G rated)...

...I'm a lady who lunches, knows nothing about the challenges of the daily workplace grind, and has the time to sip mimosas for 3 hours each afternoon (the mimosa element is really part of a broader alcohol fantasy that I should get checked out)...also, you should know that I'm always wearing a gigantic, Kentucky-derby style hat in this scenario. 

While the fantasy isn't likely to be my reality anytime soon, I love Arcadia Farms for having created a cozy and charming atmosphere that inspires just this sort of harmless day dreaming. The restaurant itself if small, which adds to the French country/shabby chic feel. The patio is beautiful and has a quaint garden feel. When you're there you'll immediately notice that the \"ladies who lunch\" fantasy is actually a reality for many of the patrons.

The food is lovely, which is exactly how food should be at this type of place. One of my favorites is the pesto shrimp salad, and the warm vegetable salad is a close second. If you're in the mood to splurge, order one of the mini cakes - you'll be glad you did. Arcadia Farms is as famous for fabulous pastries as it is for salads, sandwiches and tea. 

When you're next at the Phoenix Art Museum, keep in mind that Arcadia Farms has another location there, though it is somewhat different. Similarly delish menu, but the atmosphere is much more streamlined and modern to fit the feel of the museum. While I love the original location the most, the museum location is a great treat when you're downtown."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken crepe. It was super delicious and fresh. Good price and fresh ingredients. The foods were good but server didn't ask if I want any desserts or something, and just gave me a check when I was really satisfied with the foods."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous.  The service and atmosphere were wonderful.  On a beautiful day like today, it was the perfect setting to sit out on the patio. It is worth saving room for dessert. I took half of my lunch home so that I could enjoy dessert.  Yum!"}
{"text":"While Arcadia Farms still looks charming, the quality and flavor of the food needs to improve. We both had a tasteless warm vegetable salad that more vinaigrette could not save. Was very surprised that this was such a miss. Our server was extremely nice and efficient. Not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"From a well-traveled perspective, regarding the food, service and ambiance, I was truly disappointed on every level.  This was my third time, the last being on Mother's Day.  The food was fair and the service was unacceptable!

I went there on a Saturday, no reservation, so a wait was expected, and we were told 20 to 25 minutes.  Fifty minutes later we were seated.  Fifteen minutes later after being seated and asking twice about a server, a manager came over took our drink order and an appetizer order.  Fifteen minutes after that our server came by, we had received our drinks and Goat Cheese appetizer beforehand, and he asked us if we wanted bread.  It came halfway through our lunch with the excuse that he had to go across the street to get it (that took approximately 25 minutes) It was cold and butter was not appealing.  Strange!!!

The kicker, but not the last thing, unfortunately, was when my daughter ordered her second Peach Bellini, the waiter, when he finally got around to asking if we needed anything, asked if it was okay if he used the same glass since they were running out of glassware.  We had never had a request like that before, ANYWHERE!!!  He gave us a dessert menu, and we decided to take a piece of Key Lime Pie/Tart home, only to be made aware, after waiting another fifteen minutes for his return, to be told  they didn't have Key Lime Pie, they only had Creme Brulee which should have been mentioned when the menus were given to us; wouldn't you think?

Overall,  this restaurant, in my opinion, is way over glorified.  To even say it's cute is reaching.  It seems their staff /organization needs an overhaul.   And I think the food is very fair.  If you are used to good ambiance, good service and overall good food with a SMILE, pick another venue!!!

Needless to say,  we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Yummy! Crab cake salad and creme brule on the outside patio on a beautiful day makes this a fabulous place to feel nurished creatively and physically! Only complaint is that its a little pricey..."}
{"text":"Attended a beautiful baby shower in the Hacienda. Wait staff was on point. The menu options were fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the grilled vegetable chopped salad."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, the food is good and the menu fresh. I thought it was a little pricey for lunch and the more masculine crowd might be put off by the shabby chic decor."}
{"text":"This place is a great place for lunch with your significant other, but probably better for a her than him. I think the environment is fine and the food is great- depends on the occasion I suppose"}
{"text":"Stop here after visiting the art museum... The cafe has an understated elegance that is relaxing. The menu is limited... The daily soups are surprisingly good as is the rasberry and goat cheese salad. Depending on what you order, pricing is moderate ($11-$30)."}
{"text":"Not our best experience at Arcadia Farms.  Food was still good, but service was atrocious.  One should never have to wait 40 minutes to order WITHOUT COFFEE at a place that specializes in breakfast.

Have been there many times before and never had problems, so will definitely return and hope this was an aberration."}
{"text":"Really 3.75 stars.
The place is adorable - even the bathroom are super cutely decorated! The back patio is wonderfully shaded and just lightly misted with a fabulous area of well-kept greenery.
The service was spot-on and the food quite good.
While not on the menu at all, I asked that they scramble me some eggs and add in some of the vegetables offered in other items. The answer was a quick and resounding \"Of course!\". My bacon serving was 2 slices and it was smokey, sweet, meaty, salty, crispy and delish! The potatoes were quite uneven in size and therefore very uneven in how they were cooked. My cup of coffee was the best I had during my stay in AZ.
I would come back here in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"While I usually love this place, I came here with some friends last weekend for breakfast and it was so-so. I ordered the eggwhite asparagus breakfast with fruit and hickory smoked bacon. This was the first time I've been here for breakast, usually I come for lunch and it is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon, it was not busy, we did not have to wait to be seated.  Every table is a good table, whether outside or inside which is still airy and beautiful.  

They have some great looking sandwiches and appetizers on the menu, this being my first time there I wanted something unique and chose their crepes.  Oh my goodness my mouth still waters just thinking about them! The mushroomy sauce in them is sooooo tasty.  My husband ordered a sandwich and said it was great.  For dessert we had their creme brulee, which came with a berry compote and nuts on top, very very good.  My husband had the carrot cake and was extremely annoyed when I asked for a bite cause he wanted every last crumb to himself.

They serve wine and beer, I ordered their cheapest glass of Pinot Noir off the menu and I wish I would have written down the name cause it was perfect, it was slightly sweet but not too sweet. mmmmm

All the way around a lovely Saturday afternoon dining experience."}
{"text":"Dined with 10 friends.  Service was not great.  Service is slow. Had to ask several times for help.  Tables were uneven.   Why aren't there any flowers are the tables?  Really disappointed!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for an elegant, casual lunch.  Loved the selection and meals at the cafe today.  Service was attentive and food was top-notch.  A perfect place for \"ladies who lunch.\""}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for a while now and finally made it here for a late Sunday lunch. The space was a lot larger than I had originally anticipated, they have a huge shaded courtyard in the back (great for AZ weather) and they have a few different rooms that make up the inside seating area and are each decorated differently.
We sat in their backyard courtyard and ordered their house red sangria, crab cakes, and chicken wild mushroom leek crepe.
The sangria was tasty (perfect for a mid afternoon drink) and it had sliced oranges and strawberries in it.
The crab cakes were delicious- they were fairly substantial and you could see all of the crab meat that went into them. They also came with an ample salad which complimented them nicely.
The chicken, wild mushroom leek crepes were also very tasty and actually went with the salad from the crab cakes very nicely.
We unfortunately didn't get a chance to try any of their desserts because we were too full from lunch but their carrot cake from the marketplace looked delicious!"}
{"text":"So disappointed! I am sitting at the farm now, with the bill in front of me, yet my empty plate is still on the table, and has been for 15 minutes. The crepe with bechamel does not come with bechamel, it came with milk on top or so it would seem from the lack of thickness we would associate with a true bechamel. We respectfully asked for something else and were treated to attitude the rest of the breakfast!  
Why do servers not realize that an unhappy customer doesn't come back?  Our waitress Janis knew right away we were unhappy but instead of asking, she avoided us. I actually stopped another waitress, who much to her credit, was gracious and polite and offered another choice.  Then when the hostess brought the new dish she plopped it in front of my husband and said \"sorry you didn't like the crepes\" in an extremely disingenuous manner.  Sorry Arcadia Farms, your location may be cute but I'd rather eat soupy crepes at a restaurant that understands the lifetime benefits of making sure customers are happy.  Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow was I happy I found this wonderful little place for a late breakfast after flying in to town. A cross between neighborhood cafe and bed & breakfast, Arcadia serves up an excellent breakfast. I kept it simple with a tasty Almond Croissant to tide me over right away and followed it up with the two eggs any style (scrambled) with breakfast potatoes and bacon. Oh the bacon. Perhaps the best tasting bacon I've ever had. Yes it was that good! You know a place is 5 stars when they can get simple classic dishes to taste great. How great? I normally slather on some ketchup or sour cream on my potatoes and eggs but wouldn't have even thought about it here everything was so well done and flavorful.

Service was also excellent and Pam was a friendly server I would recommended to anyone. If you are in the Scottsdale area and it's time for breakfast, you can't go wrong with Arcadia Farms."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened to the restaurant and their customer service, but was extremely disappointed today when we found out that the baby shower cake we brought for our shower being held there could not be served!  

We have had at least a dozen showers, graduation parties, etc. there over the past years and have always been allowed to bring in our own dessert.  They claimed \"health department violation\" which I believe is a weak excuse...

We will not be having any future events here unfortunately, because it used to be one of our favorite places.  Too bad - their customer service has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Pros... Food and atmosphere.  So lovely!  Cons... horrible service.  the worst service I have ever had.  And I was taking clients there as I thought it was an impressive place.  We waited 20 minutes before the server even came around to take our order.  We had empty glasses almost the whole time.   We had dirty plates sitting in front of us for at least 15 minutes. Unfortunately I won't go back, unless I have two hours to spend on a work-lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"Although my initial visit was not as impressive as I hoped, I still gave a few more tries and Arcadia Farms did not let me down. Came back many times for girls out, breakfast and lunch, tried out a few salad options and sweets, and my experience just got better and better! This 'secret garden' definitely has kept up with the great food and atmosphere, i'm just lovin' it :)"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was terrible. Everything is slow. Never checked on to get refills after food came out. Ate our entire meal without anything to drink."}
{"text":"Don't miss this experience of combination of atmosphere and wonderfully constructed food!

And, guys, don't be put off by the other reviews that say this is a place for the \"girls.\"  If you enjoy a good, unique food experience, this place is it.   Girls and metro sexual men aren't the only ones who can appreciate it!

The atmosphere is cozy and a little misleading in terms of the space.  At first it looks small and cramped.  But the housing is actually spacious with plenty of outdoor seating in front, along the sides of the building, and out in the back.  The interior reminds me of a a little cottage (ok guys, don't lose me....remember the food....food....)

The food is farm fresh and the menu has interesting selections.  Any of their salads are wonderful.  They've got sandwiches too.  But you need to go straight to the AF Classics. My favorite meal is the Wild Mushroom Spinach and Goat Cheese Tart.  My mouth is watering just at the memory.  I wish I had the talent to write about the \"innovative\" flavors dancing on my palet, blah, blah.  Instead, I just have to say: TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.

I think this a great choice for a couple or for a low key date."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little place with a simple menu of baked goods, sandwiches, soup and salads.

I've had three different flavors of cookies - all of which have been delish. I've also had a few salads that I enjoyed. However, the one time I ordered a sandwich, I ended up throwing the whole thing away. It was that bad. Don't order the one with chicken, brie, onions and bacon. yuck. (surprising - because I love all those ingredients)!

Anyhow, if you're looking for a quick lunch - this isn't it (unless you get their pre-made salads). Their sandwiches take forever (i.e. 15 minutes and no one in front of you)! And I even waited a long time for soup the other day.

I will be back for more baked goods and salads. Hopefully I'll get to try their breakfast menu one of these days too. Super cute place, perfect for lunching with a girlfriend.

PS - On a recent long wait, they even gave me a free peanut butter cookie. So at least they recognize that."}
{"text":"I came here with my BFF and was looking forward to it because it had some good reviews online.
It is a charming place with very cute patio seating.
The service though needs improvement. We ordered coffee and tea it took the waitress 20 minutes to bring out our drinks... I hate to be so critical but having to wait for your coffee that long is frustrating!
We ordered an omelette and the French toast. The food was just okay and it was a small portion... 
I'm leaving this place hungry... Won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to go to Arcadia farms fir early mothers day lunch and were sadly disappointed our waitress never asked if we needed anything to drink other then water she never asked if we needed anything at all she just sat our food down and walked away that is when it finally came. She just wasn't welcoming and the food was not great"}
{"text":"Im a fan of sitting out back. Cute little spot to take mom or the girls. Free strawberries w/your bottle purchase. Staff was attentive. Grab some cookies on your way out."}
{"text":"Very disappointing and seriously understaffed ... from reception all the way through. We were seated early for our 11 reservation. By noon ... no food and it would have been another 20 min. We had theater tickets so had to leave. Mgr comped our few beverages and 1 coffee cake, as she should have. Don't know if it was a bad day ... but will be a long time before we try again."}
{"text":"I took a chance on Arcadia Farms for my birthday lunch today and I'm so happy I did!  It was a wonderful meal.  

Atmosphere = *****

I've been wanting to go here for a while, having driven by once on my way from Daily Dose - it was love at first sight.  I was beckoned by the wine colored awning and cream umbrellas, invited by the small front patio dotted with greenery.  Just walking into the entrance is a treat.

The interior is so sweet and cozy, very feminine with a touch of beach cottage feel.  The back patio looks gorgeous and wonderfully shady - I will definitely request a table out there next time I visit.  

Service = ****

Service wise, no complaints.  Our waitress was very pleasant and handled our meal fluidly, if not with a lively personality.  There were three of us, no special orders, dining in the afternoon during a slow period (the place was a little less than half full), so there's your grain of salt.

Food = ****

Okay, now - the FOOD.  Namely, the Chicken, Wild Mushroom, and Leek Crepes.  I love me a savory crepe, and these blew me away.  The filling also had goat cheese (for the win!), and and the whole thing was covered in a basil beurre blanc.  The basil was a different sauce that had been swirled over the beurre blanc - so pretty!  And the perfect portion - ample, not skimpy, not too filling.  Best thing I've eaten out in a while!

Everything else we ordered was solid - tasty and and fresh, but for me, the crepe dish rose above the rest.  Still, all was delicious, though there were a few little things that could be worked on, in my opinion.  The noshing bread provided was yummy, but could have been a bit warmer (time of day has an influence on that, of course.)  The Crab & Avocado Stack was light and refreshing, a great starter.  The Baked Goat Cheese could have used a seasonal fruit accompaniment, since the crostini ran out before the dip did.  The Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad had great flavors, but was a little dry and had a touch too much lettuce to toppings ratio.  My friend's Warm Chopped Vegetable Salad was not particularly pleasing to the eye and I didn't take the opportunity to taste it, but she said it was delicious.  Also, we slurped down a sweet little vat of white wine sangria, which was a little weak for my taste, but still really enjoyable.  I think it would be at its best on a hot summer day.

I'm going back to try the breakfast soon, and I'm looking forward to checking out their marketplace across the street!"}
{"text":"Seriously blown away at how horrible our service was at breakfast today. 20min after being seated we still weren't acknowledged and had to speak to the hostess multiple times to ask for service. We needed place settings, we had to get up to ask. We wanted to order, we needed to get up to ask. Additional napkins, had to get them ourselves. When the meals came we were one short, assuming it was on its way, it took 10min for our server to come out for us to let her know. The table was completely done eating and my wife's meal still had not been brought out. When it did come, it was brought out by a different server and when my wife asked if she could get a refill on her coffee she said, \"I guess I can do that.\" With service like we were having, sarcastic jokes should be avoided, it just came off as rude. Our server finally came and apologized for forgetting to put in my wife's meal. I have to say we were a table of 4 plus a toddler who didn't order, not a large party, but at least she was honest about the mistake. It took another 20min to pay the check with our server finally coming out with our copy to sign, without my credit card. She asked if it was brought out to me already, knowing it hadn't, then running back it to find where she placed it. The place was semi full for breakfast but still plenty of open seating and well staffed so our breakfast should not have been the hour and forty five minute production that it was. Overall the worst SERVICE we've had. Food was pretty good, but good food is super easy to find these days."}
{"text":"A truly lovely establishment.

Went here for a luncheon with my sorority alumnae chapter on a Sunday afternoon. This little cafe is nothing more than one banquet room and a long patio of small tables with a gorgeous courtyard out back. My experience may have been different than normal dinning because we had the main room reserved for 20 some odd people and a set menu, so I cannot comment of normal day-to-day service. But I can tell you the banquet service was superb and very attentive and detail-oriented. 

Beautiful place settings accompanied the sunny atmosphere in the little room that allowed us have a small table in addition to our long tables for sitting. The food was simply delightful. The light toast with brie and mimosas to the lunch we had. I had the salmon salad and although I wish it'd had a little more potatoes, it was very good and the salmon was cooked just right. 

As for dessert, we got a heaping cylinder shaped slice of red velvet cake that wa by far the best red velvet cake I have ever had. I would like to go back here for brunch with my mom or a girlfriend and just enjoy the scenery and the good looking wait staff again. So cute!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great to sit outside on a nice day. The service is pretty slow, so you have to be patient and be able to sit for a while. Their salads are great! I ordered the oriental peanut salad, and I would definitely order it again. Very cute place that I would visit on another occasion!"}
{"text":"Any reviews in regard to rude waitstaff should be disregarded. I was here this morning and had a pleasant experience! All were so kind and welcoming."}
{"text":"This is a small, cute little place to stop in for coffee and something freshly baked, or grab a light lunch to go.  If you're staying at the Hotel Valley Ho, it's within walking distance, so that's an added bonus.  I had a cappuccino and a lemon cake cookie, and both were delicious."}
{"text":"We started with the cheese plate. Have to say it was a little bit lacking. There were no jams/honey. The cheeses were not that inspiring.

Three of us had salads. I had the grilled veggie salad. It was tasty but not a wow. It was completely overdressed. The other two ladies enjoyed their salad a bit more.  One friend ordered a sandwich, which she enjoyed but the bread was overpowering.

We ended with the carrot cake. It was insanely dense and a little bit sweeter than my taste.

Overall, it was a good choice for a light lunch. 

The decor was great, you felt as if you were dining in an updated farm house. The service was good, not great but they looked to be closing the place so they were busy outside."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! and staff! Originally we planned to host our event in the main Arcadia Cafe, but decided to move to The Hacienda, across the street from the main facility. The room is beautiful with a Spanish mission influence.

All of the food -- appetizers, salad, entrees and dessert -- was fabulous.  Our servers were friendly and efficient in serving the large crowd. Our guests continued to compliment the food, service and decor for days afterward.

We thank everyone at Arcadia Farms for making our evening truly special."}
{"text":"Have eaten here for years and in the last year some very disappointing experiences.  I always get the warm veggie salad, used to be loaded with veggies.  Last few times I have ordered, there is less than a 1/4 cup of vegetables, literally not even a whole stock of asparagus, teeny bite of roasted red pepper.  What has happened?  $13 dollars for a bowl of romaine lettuce??  Used to serve warm rolls with butter.  Not serving any bread and do not offer.  When we ask we got a hunk of stale bread.  I always get the chocolate toffee cookie, which usually is very moist/brownie like with large gooey toffee pieces.  Not any more, not moist and one teeny piece of toffee.  Not worth it!  Apparently someone is cutting the quality and value of the food for larger profit margins!  Yikes, please put it back the way it was, or we won't be back nor will we bring our out of town friends.  Really very disappointing for such a landmark restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out as I had got my mother in law a gift certificate for here...  It is what appears to be an old farmhouse that was left standing in the middle of Scottsdale busy city life..  The inside is very charming, like stepping into someone's home with all the good smells of cooking.  We didn't make reservations and since it was a Sunday, knew we were pushing it, especially with the after church crowds.  But as luck should have it, was able to sit outdoors and was such a nice sunny day, was great.   I had the Chicken, wild mushroom and leeks crepe..was that ever heavenly!  My husband the strawberry chicken salad, which he also enjoyed..  One thing that drew my attention was that there were a lot of women senior citizens...very well dressed ones...obviously part of the Scottsdale upper crust..I think we were the youngest ones in there.. Next time I'm back in Scottsdale will have to go back.."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot in scottsdale for breakfast/lunch.  Great service,  great food. They have organic  and local options which is awesome."}
{"text":"We've had good meals here in the past, but today the service was unacceptable.  The restaurant was not exceptionally crowded, but they could not get our food out in a reasonable time.  Several tables came and went while we waited.  We had enough and left.  No apologies or explanations were offered. 
I am certain this will be or last visit here.  There is no shortage of good restaurants with good service to choose from in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning a group of us came to this restaurant. The hosted was very difficult to work with. She refused to accommodate us to seat at one table. The place was not crowded at all. Parking is a hassle and food was good. Be careful if you split or share your food. there is a $3 extra charge. I would go there with smaller group or just  as couples."}
{"text":"Ok, I love this place!  All of the food on the menu is so fresh and the setting is adorable.  The salads are amazing!  Every time I have gone the service has also been right on par with the food.  This is a great place for a girl's lunch or for Sunday brunch with the family."}
{"text":"A high end gorgeous restaurant with good prices! Their salads are delicious and beautiful and their mini cakes are amazing. Picturesque food."}
{"text":"We were made to feel super uncomfortable when we were here. Also, Parking is super annoying since they don't want you parking in the \"marketplace\" parking. So just plan on paying for vallet. Honestly, it was so awkward, we didn't stay to order. Hopefully this isn't he norm."}
{"text":"This was such a wonderful surprise. A quaint European cottage-style restaurant was so very cute. The food was excellent. I had the egg Strada cobbler, and my husband had the berry crepes. We both loved the food. Very low key and relaxing, perfect for the lazy morning we were enjoying."}
{"text":"Hostess was rude and acted blown away we didn't have reservations. Not sure why I would need them when only 1/4 of the tables are taken on a Friday morning. Not like it was Sunday.....anyways sat down waited 15 mins no one brought water to the table or anything. Must have really needed that reservation. Got up and walked out. Won't go back. Food might be good not sure, rude slow service - no thanks."}
{"text":"We tried this place in support of the local ingredients. Food was good, but serving sizes were small and disappointing. I got the black bean omlet which had too much creme fresh for me and the breakfast potatoes lacked seasoning and there were only a few tiny pieces. Come on, potatoes aren't that much. The ham crepe had tons of great flavors, but the serving size was tiny, especially for the cost. The bruchetta brunch was a good size - 3 toast pieces covered with eggs. Don't go here on a real empty stomach, but the food is ok."}
{"text":"I went there a few days ago with some girlfriends and it was a bad visit! We waited 45 minutes for 3 omelettes, we received no apology for the wait, they overcharged my credit card with an amount I did not authorize and the food was bland. They eggs were dry with barely any vegetables in it  and the potatoes (which were covered in something red so you would think had flavor) were not even helped with salt. All for the ridiculous pricing they had I could have made a better omelet for a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"Fabulous, Fabulous, Fabulous!  We happened upon Arcadia Farms while in Scottsdale.  One of the best restaurants I have eaten at since moving to Arizona a year ago.  Very well made, plenty to eat, I left full.  We enjoyed eating on the patio.
I had the egg white scramble with grilled asparagus and potatoes.  The potatoes were plump and well seasoned.  I will return for sure the next time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Back again for a second breakfast because the first was so good!  Excellent selections and everything actually tasted as good as it sounded. Practically perfect - losing one star because the coffee isn't hot enough, and the response to a request for a re-heat is a tad surly... We expect that on the East Coast, but not in friendly AZ!  And - loud acupuncture type music"}
{"text":"Went there during a recent vacation in January. Food is tasty, ambience is good with nice music. Weather is awesome which made the outdoor rustic seating extra nice. Very flavorful and also it's not crowded since we went on a weekday morning for brunch."}
{"text":"Great service and lunch selection. First time guests and we will definitely return. Never felt rushed. Lisa, our server was awesome. Quesadillas, cobb salad and tuna salad, perfect. Thanks for a lovely christmas eve lunch Arcadia Farms."}
{"text":"Looks like Joey and I went the same day and had the same server!  It was almost an hour before she came to take our order and then we waited another 30 minutes for food, which was finally delivered by a couple of other servers.  Finally, we had to go to the hostess station to pay because she dropped off the bill and then didn't come back.  Food is good, but service was horrible."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this Scottsdale treasure a few months ago.  Its the perfect place to grab lunch with friends, or to celebrate birthdays or wedding/baby showers.  I enjoyed the wild mushroom, spinach goat cheese tart, and a glass of chardonay, whilst sitting on the patio.  It was such a wonderful experience.  I look forward to my next visit there!"}

{"text":"Service was horrible.... But the food was great. 
It took us 1:55 mins to eat lunch from sit-down to walkjng out the door. I realize this is a ladies lunch venue, but it took every bit of coaxing we could give to get our server to \"wait\" our table. She was very unconcerned about getting beverages to us, taking our orders, and getting the food back out. I don't even want to talk about how long it took to get our bill !"}
{"text":"What a gem of a place in old town Scottsdale. Has it all from ambiance to service. They use as many local products as possible, great bruch sparkling wine selections. Prices are great and portions spot on. This place is must try, I will be going there again!"}
{"text":"I actually heard about Arcadia Farms on Yelp - so I figured when I was in old town I'd check it out - lo and behold I was there and decided to stop by - this isn't a totally legit review as I did not eat....
Seems I arrived approximately twenty minutes prior to closing, I should've known something was up when I got a parking space in front of the (open) front door - Anyway - I go in, there is one couple and one guy waiting in line - I patiently wait my turn, easssy ten minutes browsing the shop, its cute, small, few gifty trinket type items around, but I wasn't looking for a big box. 
Once it is my turn to order I ask what the special are, the blonde at the register tells me that they do not offer Saturday specials,,,interesting I think to myself,,, I wonder why there is a very large \"Today's Special\" sign out front. I proceed by trying to order a pressed chicken sandwich, she pauses, quite a pause, then stops waiting on me during this pause to take two to go boxes from another employee ( I figured for the couple who were perusing their iPhones at the nearby table) She then asks the guy (clearly the sandwich maker) for a pressed chicken sandwich???? Formed as a question,,,,Can she have one??? Pressed Chicken??? It was as if she was confused,,,is this a restaurant? Do I take customer requests off of a menu and place an order??? Now I'm wondering...hmmmm, isn't it on the menu? I am aware its not a special because quite frankly she has already schooled me in that dept...sandwich maker guy says nah, sorry, we are out of chicken.
Right then,,,,I decide to go to La Grande - 
Might be back someday but doubt it."}
{"text":"We stopped in for brunch on a Friday morning. There was no wait and we were seated right away. The coffee was delicious and we were given a complimentary muffin. I ordered the breakfast panini and it was very good. The bacon was very flavorful. My fiancé ordered the egg strata cobbler. It was delicious and had a lot of vegetables in it.
It was a beautiful day and we sat on the patio. It's a very peaceful environment. The marketplace next door is cute and worth checking out."}
{"text":"So lunch was over before it really ever began.  The waitress took a twenty minute break after bringing us our water.  Granted being a young person who eats out a lot, I get this treatment from time to time.  We had no choice but to leave after a remarkable amount of time went by.    I also recommended a friend to go eat there after this happened because I still had faith in the menu.  However my buddy informed me he had a horrible breakfast in which he took one bite and was done.  I haven't personally eaten anything but I don't see myself wanting to come back.  There are too many below average breakfast spots in old town and it is a bummer these owners don't have a clue what \"Quality\" food is."}
{"text":"So now, Phoenix Art Museum has FREE admission every WEDNESDAY night... and the Cafe is open every WEDNESDAY night... since my last review, I've noticed a few more people joining us each time so it's catching on as a place to grab some food before that 7pm event at the Museum!   See ya there!"}
{"text":"If I could brunch on a sunny patio everyday I would! Until then, I'll happily take any opportunity I can get.

Arcadia Cafe is a cute, gardenesque venue that allows me to enjoy a lovely brunch and feel somewhat fancy without spending a lot of money.

Both the fresh berry crêpes and crêpes croque-monsieur are delicious in their own way. The berry crepes are almost like having dessert for breakfast! And the conque-monsieur is savoury with ham, cheese bechamel sauce but light with the use of crêpes instead of bread.

You can even sip on tea or coffee and indulge on treats from their bakeshop if you're not looking for a full meal. The atmosphere is something you'll want to experience."}
{"text":"I love visiting Arcadia Farms Cafe when I'm in Scottsdale.  Great food and quality service."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place half of a star, however that wasn't an option. One star is too generous. First off, the business hours listed online stated that they opened at 8am. However, when we arrived at 9am we were promptly told they were closed and wouldn't be opening for service until 9:30am due to the \"holiday.\" We chose this place because of the ambiance so it was a good option for mothers day. We had three people total and were the first guests to arrive at the restaurant. Despite this, we were immediately denied service for not having a reservation and given no other option. This place failed miserably in terms of customer service, and for a place with this price point and expectation, their professionalism and hospitality was severely lacking. In the restaurant business a certain amount of personalized accommodation is necessary to build and uphold your establishment's reputation. Instead we got bombarded with excuses from the three snooty girls at the front desk. I have eaten here previously and the food was sub par, I only returned for the ambiance and the good bakery for mothers day. This desire was quickly eliminated once my family and I were treated like yesterdays trash."}
{"text":"Mothers Day brunch. Street parking no problem. Got seated right away. But then the wait, and wait. Finally someone arrived at the table and took drinks orders, did say ready to order, but somehow didnt register as waitress disappeared. Finally different waitress arrived for food order. And then after 25mins we got our drinks (water and lemonade). I should have asked questions (several) when making reservation. I thought we had been before on Mother's Day, but presented with a fixed menu (asked for the regular menu, was not an option). Not a dessert person, just wanted the meal, but okay. Ordered salmon (very disappointing, not fresh by any stretch of the imagination). 

The bill arrived with a 20% gratuity added in, there were just 3 of us. I was very upset. I should have said something, and normally would. but did not want to upset my dear wife. I am still steaming over that 20% gratuity,  for poor service and mediocre food. 

We have been to Arcadia Farms on several occasions, and was always a pleasant experience.  Has there been a change of ownership or management recently, this was not fun. Felt had been royally fleeced"}
{"text":"Very nice brunch spot. The baked goods were gorgeous. The omelette station was a great choice for a toddler to allow him to eat while we enjoyed the coffee as sunshine. 

The coffee was fine but nothing special. The baguette eggs sandwich was delicious."}
{"text":"We have been there twice in the last several days for breakfast.  The food was prepared well, seemed very fresh and was all-in-all very good.  My issue the first time was presentation of my dish - an omelette and home fried potatoes - where it was all served on a large plate but looked very plain and sparse.  On both occasions, we were disappointed with the service. On our first visit, I had to ask our server twice for more hot water for my tea, and never got it until another server got it for me.  The second time, we waited 20 minutes for our food, my husband's coffee cup sat empty several times after he was asked if he wanted more coffee, said \"yes please,\" then it didn't come until he asked again.  My sense was they didn't have enough help for the size of the place and the number of customers."}
{"text":"I had the crab cakes which were wonderful.  I will be back.  Great atmosphere but go when you have some time. The food is made fresh so it takes a bit longer but so worth it. Our server was wonderful and made several recommendations depending on different tastes."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent food, wonderful service.  I ordered a chicken cobb salad with feta dressing which turned out to be delish!  Enjoyed our lunch!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite brunch spots! They have dishes to delight everyone, and the ambiance is just lovely. I do wish there were a few less tables in certain areas, as it can get crowded on a weekend. Also, I would love to see a few gluten free dessert options for those of us who want to indulge safely! Note: reservations are recommended on the weekends."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms reminds me of Lifetime: TV for Women (and gay men).  On any given Saturday afternoon, it's fun to place bets on how many bridal and baby showers will be going on simultaneously.  This place puts out a siren song for the ladies who lunch.  As a result, the people watching is top-notch.  It's often like having an episode of \"The Real Housewives of North Scottsdale/Paradise Valley\" unfold at the table next to you.  Arcadia Farms is like a shrine to estrogen and it's rare for the BF and me to see more than another man or two in the place, but we don't mind.  The floor show is free, after all.  And if you want the valet to park your car in front of the restaurant, be sure to bring the Bentley.

The decor is one step removed from shabby chic.  It's feminine, but they got rid of most of the frills a few years back.  If the weather is accommodating, the back patio is the place to be.  It's really a lovely setting under the trees.  The small building at the back of the restaurant is usually reserved for the aforementioned bridal and baby showers.  

The food at Arcadia Farms is very good.  Don't go expecting gourmet dishes; it's important to remember that at its heart Arcadia Farms is a catering company.  Actually, the BF and I have Arcadia Farms cater our annual holiday party and they do a fantastic job.  

For appetizers, the Savory Smoked Salmon Cheesecake is delicious.  The portion used to be way too huge, but now it's been scaled back to a very manageable size as a starter for at least two people to share.  The Crab and Avocado Tower is also a good option, but the tower invariably collapses before it arrives at the table.  The BF and I usually start off by splitting an entree, the Wild Mushroom, Spinach and Goat Cheese Tart.  It is packed with cheesy goodness and comes with a side salad that creates nice contrast.  It splits into a hearty appetizer.  It was a dark day when spinach was pulled from the market and Arcadia Farms couldn't make this tart.  Thankfully, all is right with the world again.

For entrees, the Strawberry Chicken Salad is a classic for good reason.  Where Arcadia Farms manages to find such ripe strawberries year-round remains a mystery to me.  The Oriental Chicken Salad is also delicious.  Whenever I order this dish, I go for the gusto and request an extra side of the peanut sauce as the chicken pieces are luscious when dipped directly into the peanut sauce.  The California Club is a solid sandwich choice.  For me, the focaccia bread is too thick, but you can ask them to substitute another bread.  For something more substantial (and sinful), go for the Chicken, Wild Mushroom and Leek Crepes.  They're fantastic.  This dish also splits well.

Everything on the Arcadia Farms menu is fresh and tasty.  The challenge will be deciding what to order on a given day.  Ask if they have specials as they can be good.  On a recent visit the server went through a very lengthy description of a special salad and then she casually mentioned that they had already run out of it.  The BF and I found that rather amusing.

The signature Arcadia Farms beverage is apricot iced tea and it's quite flavorful.  The one nit is that they don't serve the tea with a straw or an iced tea spoon.  There are no spoons at the table and it's hard to catch your server's attention because they're busy moving from table to table.  So you are forced to stir your iced tea with the blade of your table knife.  The BF and I have talked about this several times while dining at Arcadia Farms and I think one of the servers overheard us the last time because they finally brought our iced tea with spoons.  Perhaps that will be a permanent change as it would certainly be welcome.  Beer and wine are also offered, with the expected restaurant markup.  

In terms of pricing, you get a good amount of food for the price.  For a fancy brunch/lunch spot, the pricing is fair.  This place isn't in the cheap eats category, but you could get out of here for $20 per person if you only had a salad or sandwich.  But what's the fun in that?

The desserts at Arcadia Farms are pretty good, but the BF and I never have room for them.  The carrot \"baby cake\" is tasty, but it's big enough that you will need to split it with at least one other person.

Arcadia Farms also offers private luncheons and afternoon tea.  This is really an ideal spot for a bridal or baby shower."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with my family for an early father's day lunch. I had the strawberry chicken salad, but added goat cheese. The poppyseed dressing  was awesome. The waitress said they make all of their dressings in house and they're all vinegar based. I appreciate their homestyle, more health conscious approach. Everything seemed very fresh and light. 

I was also fortunate enough to try the brownies and chocolate hazelnut bars. Both were delicious and able to satisfy my chocolate craving sweet tooth. 

The service was also great. My brother was over an hour late and she was very cool about keeping his food warm until he came and us staying and talking for a while after we were finished. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This cute cafe was highly recommended to us for a great place for breakfast! We had a fabulous breakfast, the pastries were fresh and large portions. I had the yogurt parfait with the homemade granola and it was amazing along with the coffee cake. My husband had the egg whites with asparagus and a croissant. We enjoyed our entire experience, everyone was friendly + good food = a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"If you go anywhere for breakfast (or lunch) in Scottsdale, go here!!!

Our experience at Arcadia Farms was just wonderful: food, service, ambiance.  It was like we were eating NY brunch from Alice Water's garden, but didn't pay a lot for it.  My omelet was scrumptious, with yummy potatoes and eggs.  My friend had to guard her sandwich because it looked and smelled so yummy.  The wait staff was very helpful and attentive (even helping us find a few places for after our meal).  We had a wonderful meal there - thank you!

P.S. Not sure if they do this, but the outdoor area in the back looks perfect for a rehearsal dinner or a bridal/baby shower..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite ladies' lunch places. The goat cheese tart with the salad and the apricot iced tea are wonderful. Don't for get to try the coconut cake for desert!"}
{"text":"We were able to get a last minute reservation, seated right away, and the wait staff were very friendly and helpful. We had the egg strada cobbler and French toast. Both were great! I would definitely recommend it for brunch!"}
{"text":"Cute location, but overall, the experience was not what I anticipated. The service was slow, took 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 30 minutes to get some sandwiches and a salad and the place wasn't even that busy. Needed extra dressing, because the salad was so dry and my husband had to hunt down our server, because after the plates were served, she didn't come back to check on us. 

The food was okay. Certainly not as fantastic as people have told me. Paradise has better salads.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Breakfast: If you don't care about food or service but just atmosphere, it's a good place to go. Three of us went and after 20-25 minutes (they weren't crowded) and our asking where our food was, only 1 breakfast was hot. Other egg dishes were room temp or cool. We sent one back and the waitress came back quickly with the egg scramble but it was now overcooked and greasy. When we talked to her she said she had thrown it in the microwave! She wasn't pleasant at all."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  Arcadia Farms is very quickly becoming my go-to favorite spot in the Valley for when I just need to feel good.

The food is great, but I'll be honest - I don't remember much about the food.  Instead, it's the atmosphere.  The restaurant is just so wonderful, and the back patio is so beautiful. 

I also just had a private party here in one of their private rooms, and it was fabulous.  Great service, great food, and the event went off perfectly.  We even had gorgeous personalized cookie favors.

The only bad thing I can say about Arcadia Farms is that it's too pricey to eat there every day, otherwise I think I might!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast.  lovely setting with both indoor and outdoor tables. 
Food choices were tasty and various. 
Service and ambience extremely pleasant."}
{"text":"Great little spot to meet your girlfriends for brunch. It has a girly girl feel and is great for birthdays and showers. There's a private room available for parties. The food is good. Service is so-so, they can be a bit pretentious. Good spot for a light Sunday brunch. Parking is limited, but you can valet."}
{"text":"For a chance encounter with a random brunch cafe, this place hit the spot. Perfect atmosphere, food and service. I'm so glad we decided to go. The tomato spinach omelette was amazing. The ingredients are so fresh, the flavors all shine beautifully in everything."}
{"text":"No longer on open table so can't easily make reservations. Don't have heaters on patio but won't seat inside unless you have reservation. What!?"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this adorable Scottsdale spot, it's a quaint little place to take out of town guests or just to enjoy a nice weekend brunch. The ambiance is charming, the food is fresh and flavorful, and the portions are sizable so I would suggest splitting a sandwich if you're looking for a light lunch. 

Came in with a large party for a bridal party brunch and the service was flawless. I'd highly recommend the warm goat cheese salad with raspberries...perfection!"}
{"text":"Came here for birthday brunch and was assigned table in the back of the restaurant. Had made a reservation in advance. The table we wanted (which I think remained empty during our entire visit) was unavailable. Hmm...

Our server was friendly, helpful and not in a rush. She took our orders and left. Moments later, another waitress shows up - telling us she'll be our server now because our former gal had to wait on her sister. Okay ... odd. 

We had put in my daughter's order first as she was starving. It arrived minus the scrambled eggs, which the new waitress (Polly, I think her name was) told me we hadn't ordered. Oh yes, dear - but you wouldn't know because it was with your predecessor. 

10 minutes later the one scrambled egg shows up. When I mention how long it took, Polly once again started arguing and left visibly offended. 

Probably 25 minutes after placing our order, our food arrived. Polly served it without a word. Seriously - not a sound, not a nod, not a smile. I went to the hostess and asked for a different waitress - one without an attitude.

Our 3rd and final server was nice, friendly but the food disappointed. My wife's French toast arrived cold. When we asked if that was intended, our server promptly put in a new order ... which arrived lukewarm, a smaller portion, and on a cold plate. 

It would have been a 0 stars experience had it not been for our 3rd server's friendliness and the unexpected birthday cake she brought. But we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've hosted two baby showers here this year. The first was at the beginning of the year. The service was not good at all, especially at the end when the waitress for our party was extremely pushy to add an additional tip and led me to believe that her tip was not included in the service fee. After the fact I realized that I was tricked and she got a double tip (on awful service) However the food was good and the ambiance was cute so I decided to give it a try one more time this past weekend.  In booking the event, employees were very inconsistent. From room minimums to things included. When I got there to set up, it must have been our waitresses first time doing an event, because once again MANY things that I was told would happen, she said wasn't correct. Super frustrating! Then to top it all off they brought in the wrong dessert from what we had preordered. Not only would they not switch it out to what the 'guest of honor' wanted, they then didn't even try to make it right. I could go on and on. Unfortunately, the service is awful here and I not only DO NOT RECOMMEND them, I won't be using them again. It sucks, because the food is good and it has potential to be a good place to have events, but that is not worth the headache and hassle of everything else."}
{"text":"This is my boyfriend and I favorite Sunday brunch!  I love all of the crepes and mimosa when I go. We are both morning people so we typically get there right when they open and enjoy the serene house setting. Everything we have ever ordered is always warm and fresh! Exactly what I hope for in a brunch!"}
{"text":"What a charming cafe in a quaint part of town. Fabulous food, friendly service, delicious wine. I highly recommend the goat cheese and leek tarte. On this site that used to be a farm, there is the cafe, store, and Private event space. I can't wait to try their afternoon tea!"}
{"text":"Had lunch today with the positively glowing Gabi M and she suggested Arcadia Farms. I didn't realize I'd been here before until I parked. I stand by my previous review but am upgrading them to 4.5 stars. They are on the pricey side but I just love a restaurant that is designed for women. So much so I think I'll start a list.

This time I had the California club. Absolutely delicious. I opted for the potato salad on the side and it was really yummy. Gabi had a salad which was too big to finish and it looked very good as well.

We sat on the back patio and it was just lovely. This place has a great deal of outdoor space but it's secluded. None of this \"yeah, it's a patio - just try not to breathe the exhaust fumes\" mentality that restaurants are so fond of in the valley. So we enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the catchiing up. The catching up most of all.

And since I'm a temporary transplant to Scottsdale I just love how there's loads of wonderful stuff right in my own backyard."}
{"text":"I have been taking out either a Salad or a Sandwich from here for over a month. I have never been disappointed. Their food is always extremely fresh. My favorite salad is the Strawberry Chicken Salad, it is served with a wonderful poppyseed vinaigrette. Their Turkey & Brie Sandwich is also very good and I have it heated before take out. Dessert wise, the Chocolate Raspberry Cake is excellent! The Almond Croissant that I had on another occasion was a little stale, however the largely merit the 5 stars that I am giv"}
{"text":"This place has great reviews so I figured it would be worth trying - and boy was it! I passed it by on my first attempt to find the restaurant but the entire experience made up for it. We went on July 4th for breakfast so it was pretty empty and we had pretty decent service until it got busier. The complementary scones were AMAZING. The food we ordered was equally delicious too. Their patio is really cute and quaint - but be aware of the mosquitoes. I had to leave my dad with the check because I was constantly being bit and left with over 20 mosquito bites. Definitely coming back but I plan to sit inside next time."}
{"text":"Great experience and incredible food.  I had the chicken and leek crepes.  Outstanding!  Great service in a quant setting.  I will definitely be returning to this little gem in downtown Scottsdale soon."}
{"text":"Yesterday I had a lovely business lunch at Arcadia Farms Cafe at the Phoenix Art Museum. The environment suited our needs perfectly - we had a lovely table, large enough for paperwork and such, and our waitress was able to fill our glasses with mysterious ease. 

I ordered the Spinach, Mushroom and Goat Cheese Tart and the Mango Iced-Tea. 

I really liked the iced-tea - It was just naturally sweet enough to drink without sugar. The Tart was served with a salad of greens with tomatoes and cucumbers. The salad dressing was sweet and light. 

The Tart itself was extremely flavorful and full of yummy goodness, but I SO wanted to run back to the kitchen and pop it into the microwave for 30 seconds. I didn't think it was supposed to be served cold, especially since there was melted cheese on top. I am guessing the tart is pre-made and refrigerated until ordered, and then they melt cheese on top. There's something about melted cheese on top of something cold that just doesn't appeal to me. I would actually love to go back, order the Tart again, and ask for it to be heated through ... I wonder if they would do that?"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite brunch spot in Scottsdale.  The cute cottage interior coupled with the umbrella-garden patio make the perfect ambiance for brunch with the girls (it's in fact our weekly ritual).  Not exactly a man's great escape - every time I go (which is more than often) there is undoubtedly a bridal or baby shower in process. But if you men only try the food, I'm sure you won't mind the gaggle of women.  

I recommend the goat cheese appetizer to start, and the chicken and leak crepes - to die for.  Though just about everything I've tried has been outstanding, I don't think you can go wrong. They also offer a mimosa special: a bottle of champagne and orange juice for $20, but you have to ask for it. 

Bon-a-petit!"}
{"text":"Just became my new favorite spot!! Love everything about it....

The ambiance, service food ...perfecto!

We went for lunch and were seated right away even though there were really busy. Attentive service without being overbearing. brie and then shared the club sandwich...both to be raved about. 

The only thing was the crazy lady next to us but I will def be back!"}
{"text":"If you're having a tea party this is the place to go. The blue-haired, hat-wearing crowd was in full effect for lunch this afternoon. The food was adequate though a bit pricey. The Cobb salad was a nice portion and the blue cheese was very good but the dressing had almost no taste. $3 for a can of Coke? Nah. You can do better."}
{"text":"I went to Scottsdale last weekend to stay with friends and go to the Interpol concert. After an amazing concert Saturday night, we went to breakfast Sunday morning at Arcadia Farms. My friends who live in Scottsdale had raved about this restaurant, so I said 'yes! let's go Sunday morning!' I'm so very happy that we did! 

First of all, the place itself is so charming and adorable! I love the black & white sofas, white chairs and black & white framed photos on the walls. We sat just inside the first room, right behind the scrumptious baked goods! It was difficult to decide what to order, everything sounded wonderful. But I chose the Wild Mushroom & Chive Omelet with goat cheese, fresh fruit, potatoes and a side of Applewood Smoked Bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice. My friend Chantage chose the same thing, but opted for a side of toasted ciabatta bread - we shared the bread and bacon! And my friend Lisa chose the Breakfast Pannini with rosemary infused ham, white cheddar and scrambled eggs on a fresh baked baguette, also served with fresh fruit. The fresh squeezed orange juice was a delicious way to begin our meal. Our omelets were so yummy - the goat cheese was the perfect choice to top the mushrooms and chives. The potatoes were slightly dry, but still had a lovely flavor. The fresh fruit was refreshing and Lisa loved her pannini! Of course, we had to pick up some of their fresh baked pastries on the way out. Chantage bought an almond croissant that was to die for! Yes, I had a bite and it was wonderful. Lisa chose one as well, but also took other pastries home for her husband, aww...

All in all, this cafe is high on my ever-growing list of favorite restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix! I can't wait to come back when the market opens across the street so I can bring some of this deliciousness back to Tucson!"}
{"text":"Carolyn made our day after the wedding BBQ Party amazing! The food was so delicious and our mason jars filled with Sangria was a huge hit! We had high tops throughout our backyard for our guests to mingle and eat, drink around. Penny and Katherine served at our party they went above and beyond! I have referred Carolyn more business everyone appreciates her attention to detail, she goes above and beyond."}
{"text":"Nice place to sit outside and enjoy the warm Arizona weather! Went for lunch. Had the house favorite strawberry, chicken salad with poppy seed dressing served with toasted, garlic focaccia bread.  The salad was big and fresh and had just the right amount of chicken and fresh strawberries. We took pieces of carrot and coconut cake to go.  The coconut cake was enough for 3 or 4 people to enjoy!  The carrot cake was a bit smaller but both were very good!"}
{"text":"In town from Chicago. the self proclaimed brunch capital of the world, and I must say this was one of the best brunch experiences we've ever had. 

The mimosas weren't too boozy, the food was absolutely delicious and the staff and atmosphere will bring me back every time I'm in the area. Come here."}
{"text":"Arcadia farms poached the cutest house with enclosed yard and converted garage. The vintage cottage is is now a charming restaurant filled with clothed tables and a lot of luncheoning ladies.  There was an original Arcadia Farm when the neighborhood was farmland a few decades ago.  The grounds and homestead are behind an adobe wall acorss the street - where a valet does a good job of keeping away looky-loos' preying eyes.  

My ham sandwich was delcious.  Crispy. toasted bread and ample filling.

We began with a signature app - the melted brie, topped with roasted apple and surrounded by strawberries.  Then to really complete the arterial damage, we savored a wonderful coconut cake.  Desserts are made each day in the bakery across the street.  

Service was good and amusing.  The sun was out, but winds up to 50 mph whipped the courtyard and slammed doors while we ate in the former garage.  A door leads to the kitchen.  The weather plagued the cooks and the bewildered server as they worked to keep the food coming.   Our server kept popping in and out of the slamming kitchen door like a cuckoo in a clock.  Well done!"}
{"text":"I went here with my sister while I was visiting Phoenix for the weekend. I am paleo and I typically stay pretty true to the diet. Arcadia Farms is a farm to table restaurant. In the upper right hand corner of their menu they have the farms that they get their produce. I would say that the greater part of their menu is focused on eggs and the healthier side of breakfast versus the sweet. They do have pastries, French toast, crepes, etc, but that's not the main focus of their menu. Also, their prices are fairly reasonable. I could be a little bias because I am from San Diego and I have become accustom to very expensive meals."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to eat here today for the first time; excellent choice! It was homey and quiet perfect for a Monday morning. I had the best almond crossant! The staff was super friendly and sweet with our 21 month old. A for sure must try."}
{"text":"I adore this place!  I always have...I always like to go here for my bday lunch or for little events like graduation, mothers day , easter, etc.  It is so cute and it reminds me of a french cottage...I lived there so I love how it reminds me of such an amazing place!  I love the Breakfast strada cobbler OMG I have tried to duplicate it, but I have failed miserably!  The wild strawberry shortcake is also delicious and I love how ripe and sweet their strawberries are!  I adore the chicken cobb salad, oriental chicken salad and the pesto shrimp salad!  They are so delicious and I cannot get over how fresh all their ingredients always are!  Gotta love this place.  They also so private dining available if you have a larger party or having an event.  Its a great little pience of heaven right in old town scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is nice and quiet. The food was fine, nothing super special about taste. I had the breakfast panini and my fiancé had an omelette. Both were decent. The main issue I had with Arcadia Farms is the service.  Our server was initially very nice and polite; however, as soon as we began to close out she completely ignored us. We closed out because we were done eating, however we enjoyed the quietness and beautiful weather so we stayed for a little while. After closing out she did not stop by even ONCE to refill our waters or coffees. There was NO wait and we were the only table in our area. Because of the way we were treated after eating I doubt we will go back if we can avoid it.  

To sum it up, mediocre food, nice atmosphere, below average service."}
{"text":"Today was the last day my girlfriend was in town so we wanted to do a real nice brunch. I know it's Thursday but we love the thought of calling it a brunch as a brunch is just not for the weekend.

We came mid morning and there was only one other party coming in at the same time. What was nice was there were three options of what I considered three places to dine in. One area is outdoors in front of the restaurant, the other area is inside the restaurant and then there was also seating in the outdoor courtyard. We were the first of the 1/2 parties there and we were seated in a very isolated corner adjacent to the outdoor courtyard. At first, I thought it would affect the kind of service we would receive but I was wrong.

Our server was also the hostess that greeted us and she did a great job serving and making sure she was attentive. I wanted to start off with homemade cinnamon pecan rugelah but they were already sold out. The server suggested the pumpkin muffin which came with two little strawberry scones.

We started with the muffin and two house coffees that were served very hot. From the first bite of this pumpkin muffin to the last bite, it disappeared way too quickly as did the very little bite size scones. This was by far the moistest most buttery tasting muffin I ever had. Usually I just eat the muffin tops and leave the rest but this was so good that my friend and I were slicing the muffin in itty bitty pieces hoping that the one muffin would satisfy the both of us. This was beyond yummy and worthy of another order but being on an eating journey from Grassroots yesterday to the movies last night, we decided to behave.

We both ordered the same thing which was the baby spinach and tomato omelet. It was cooked to perfection with the feta cheese and tomato and spinach chunks nicely layered into the omelet and served nice and hot. I ordered the applewood smoked bacon crispy and it was also cooked to perfection. By the time we finished our meal we were full, satisfied and were planning our next return.

Got great service here, the ambiance is incredible and the breakfast has convinced me to return at another time. What a JEWEL of a place. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We called to ask if breakfast is served they said it's served till 11am when we arrived at 10:45am they said they can't serve breakfast anymore and the hostess was very snooty and un accommodating.  
Food was decent but pricey and they don't even have espresso only drip coffee."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms is by far the best lunch restaurant in scottsdale. The atmosphere is superb and has a unique, eclectic vibe. Everything on the menu is delicious, but every time I go, I always order the Brie with caramelized apples and the strawberry chicken salad (they never get old). A great place to have a baby or wedding shower since they have a private room. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Loved our breakfast with Julia as our server ! Celebrated an engagement announcement and it was the perfect spot ! We will def come back ! Dog friendly in the patio !"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Arcadia Farms and sadly I probably will not be back. My friend and I made reservations based on most of the reviews... We were seated in the back patio promptly after arriving. The atmosphere is darling - so cozy! The food was delicious. The reason for 3 stars is due to the service we received. Our waitress rarely came around, and when she did... she was not very friendly. We had a few exchanges with other waitresses (refilling our water and clearing our table) and they weren't much friendlier. Disappointing! 

Food - 10/10 
Atmosphere - 10/10 
Service 4/10 

Definitely worth a visit - I just hope the waitresses are friendlier for you!"}
{"text":"I was one of four women who hosted my friend Gabi's baby shower at Arcadia Farms last weekend and I can't say enough good things about this place. Not only is the food and decor just divine but the service is fabulous as well. We were in a private room across the street from the main building. It's next to the marketplace and very private. Our server Penny was delightful and so accommodating.  They created a fantastic menu for us and had an ipod and speaks set up for us provided delightful ambiance music. 

Would highly recommend Arcadia Farms for any occasion or just a nice Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere on the patio. Had the crab cakes which came with a salad and lime vinaigrette dressing. Everything was excellent."}
{"text":"My guy and I stopped in here for a light lunch. Top notch service and really good food. We ordered a cheese plate and split a Cobb salad. The Salad was huge! We also enjoyed some sangria....so very good."}
{"text":"Hard to believe that in the bustle of Old Town- there sits a little house tucked away serving some of the best food that I have had since coming to Scottsdale. Arcadia Farms may just be my new favorite place in town. 

A friend of mine suggested it for lunch so I ventured there on a sunny, cool afternoon. I was a little worried as I pulled up as there was alot going on from a line of cars in the front to a harried valet trying to get people to follow the que. As for me- I spied a spot on the street and just parked and walked back to the restaurant wondering all the while if I should have made a reservation. But it was no problem. 

I was asked if I wanted to be seated outside (yes, please) so I got a cute little table on the front patio- but there is also outside seating in the back plus all the little rooms of the house have cute little cozy seating arrangements in them. 

Arcadia Farms serves organic, locally grown ingredients in all of its offerings. And they also have wonderful pastries and desserts that are prepared in the bakery located across the street. I watched as they brought tray after tray of mouth watering goodies that I knew I would have to save room for. 

I ordered a range of items just so I could try them as everything sounded so good. To begin- the crab and avocado tower was terrific. Blue crab stacked with avocado and red peppers was a lovely presentation and tasted even better. 

My server, Erica was quick with suggestions so I went with the herb roasted chicken sandwich with goat cheese and artichokes on a baguette. Delicious although I could only eat half of it as I was saving room for a bite of the coconut \"baby\" cake. 

A baby cake? What was that, I wondered. Must be like a cupcake. Nope. Bigger than a cupcake smaller than a cake ,this \"baby cake\" would be perfect split 3 ways. The good news was that they wrapped the cake up for me so I shall eat cake for the next few days! 

The serve wine, beer and some signature drinks. I went with my server's wine recco and it was perfect. Nothing better than sitting outside on a beautiful day, glass of wine in hand, people watching. 

This is not a cheap place. My bill was $55 before tip (food was $35 and wine was $20) although I do have plenty of leftovers for another meal. But the great food, friendly service,and homey ambiance made it all worth it. 

Arcadia Farms is the kind of place I look for in every city I travel to. Most of the time I don't find it. But today . . .thanks to a friend's recommendation, I did."}
{"text":"Came here impromptu for a sister's luncheon. Best decision ever made.

Fantastic food: Classic with a twist (nothing crazy or boring)

Service was perfect and friendly

Prices were well worth it. Little gem in Scottsdale, we need more like this"}
{"text":"A friend and I had a wonderful afternoon at the Phoenix Art Museum last weekend, and the Arcadia Farms Cafe was certainly one of the highlights.  We were pleasantly surprised to see a full service restaurant inside the museum, as we were expecting nothing more than a food counter.  The restaurant is beautiful, and overlooks the museums courtyard.  It helps that it was a beautiful day, but the scenery in the courtyard made the experience more enjoyable.  Our server was helpful and attentive, and the food was delicious.  I had a chicken sandwich with a cup of soup. The sandwich was excellent; flavorful and not dried out.  The soup was good as well (maybe I'm nit-picking, but it needed a touch of salt).  The only thing I would knock this place for is the menu.  It's good, but not much variety. Obviously not a big deal, though, as I was able to find something I liked on the menu and enjoyed it very much.  The restaurant's other location is near where I live, in Old Town Scottsdale, so I will definitely be giving that a try."}
{"text":"Took a long while to get our bacon and eggs. Bacon was cold, potatoes were okay and the eggs were fine. Not a very complicated breakfast. Menu is not really that big for breakfast. Good atmosphere 
Our server was really nice. Food was okay nothing really that special about it. 
Also no bloody Mary's. 
Really Good coffee and good mimosas"}
{"text":"Super cute spot for breakfast or lunch as they are known for their fresh pastries and healthy organic salads. There is ample seating indoors (cozy like you're in someone's cottage) or outdoors (like a scene from The Secret Garden). Great location to hold a baby or bridal shower!

We came at 11:45AM and were given the option of brunch (ends at 12PM) or lunch (starts at 11AM). If you're caught in that 11-12PM transition zone, be aware that the entire table must all commit to the brunch menu or the lunch menu. No mixing of the menu items was allowed. I was slightly disappointed that brunch ended so early and not wanting to rush, we decided to all go with lunch. 

Regardless, the food was not disappointing. Super fresh from farm to table! We had the warm brie with caramelized apples, trio of bruschetta, warm chopped vegetable salad with chicken, fresh lump crab cakes, and the turkey and brie sandwich. 

If you're a salad lover, you will adore this spot!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good, but not obtrusive service, and delicious, delicious fresh food."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorites. A place to go when I wanted to take someone somewhere special. I loved the atmosphere, food, and service. Unfortunately, my last two visits were not so hot. Food was ok and the service sucked. Excuse my language, but I was severely disappointed. I took a group including my mother, father, and grandmother for a special brunch, a celebration. The service was just horrendous. Lots of waiting, incorrect orders, items not brought when requested. Our bill was hefty, nothing taken off for the problems we had. I received no response from management through Opentable, where I made the reservations. Sorry to say, this is no longer one of my \"places\" to go."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms Cafe is fantastic! I was recently in Scottsdale celebrating my sister's bachelorette and, after seeing great Yelp reviews, we decided to stop by Arcadia Farms Cafe for a quick brunch before hiking. The cafe is adorably decorated and the service is great. We ordered various things, including: the coffeecake, the almond croissant, the chocolate croissant, the strawberry n'cream scone, the Muesli, the granola parfait, eggs, and bacon. A lot of food? Yes, we were hungry girls carbo loading for hiking! The food was amazing! because we enjoyed the food/experience so much, we ended up stopping by Arcadia Farms Cafe again on our last day for another brunch! This time, in addition to eating at the Cafe, we also stopped by the Marketplace for items to go - we bought: granola, cookies, and pastries! I wish there were an Arcadia Farms Cafe near me! If you're in Scottsdale, definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of attending a surprise birthday party for a friend on March 7th, 2018.  There were 20 guests and we sat in the house across the street from the restaurant.  Penny was an excellent server and was very attentive to our every request.  The food (6 choices) was excellent and the coconut cake was the greatest!!!!!!!!!!!! The tables were decorated  by David Vermillion, event planner.  Delightful afternoon.  Thanks to the chef, server, owners and all that make this place great year after year!!!!!!!!!

{"text":"Not Happy. That's how I felt after Easter brunch yesterday at Arcadia Farms. We decided to go to Arcadia Farms for brunch on Easter, having made a reservation about 2 weeks in advance. We decided on this restaurant because it was somewhere new to take my Grandma, but mainly because they advised us they would be serving their regular menu at slightly higher prices, not doing a buffet. Needless to say, I was surprised when we arrived and regular menu was NOT available and there was a $20 brunch buffet. Since neither my Husband or myself are eating bread, this posed a problem considering basically it was pastries and omelets for the buffet. Well, since we were there and my Grandma is disabled, we really couldn't just pick up and go to another restaurant leaving us paying over $60 for not very much food. 

I felt like the servers were extremely apathetic and not very pleasant. They sat us all the way in the back of the restaurant when clearly my Grandma was not walking well and would need to go all the way to the front for their buffet. They moved us after we asked and then we sat on the patio, which is very nice as previous reviews have said. The food was mediocre. The best part was the bacon, which was exceptionally good for buffet bacon. 

Having been here before for my Birthday a few years ago and remembering it fondly, I was very disappointed in this most recent experience. I may go back someday, but not sure if it will be for awhile..."}
{"text":"The cutest place to have breakfast/brunch and one of the best scones I've ever eaten in my life! Everyone was so kind and inviting, I can't find a bad thing to say about this establishment!!! It's definitely worth a visit to this cafe if you're in the Scottsdale area."}

Thank you for a memorable girls day , i can hardly wait to share this special place with others"}
{"text":"I loved this place. The environment, food, customer service was so welcoming and great! The only negative thing I have to say is that by the time my mom and bro got there (amazing) omelet from the \"omelet station\" and ate it, me n my step dad hadn't even gotten out dish!! A little odd eating your meal after the others have finished... It did take about 45 minutes for eggs. But anyways I still loved it!"}
{"text":"Really good food.  I had the Strawberry Chicken Salad.  It looked so fresh and delicious! I should have taken a picture.  The poppy dressing was light and there wasn't too much of it either. I tried their apricot iced tea.  It was okay, nothing special in my opinion. 

The menu was really great and I was impressed with the wine selection. I am really excited to come back and try all the other tasty food! 

Why did I dock them a star? A couple of reasons:
1. NO art on the walls!  We are in the frickin Phoenix Art Museum people.  This should be a place to constantly exhibit art.  I've been in the store rooms, there is a ton of art that could be shown here.  Even better, allow local artists to display.
2. It took 20 minutes to get our orders taken, 30 minutes to recieve our food and another 15 to get the bill.  Although our server was polite, the entire experience took much too long.  This is a place for a leisurely meal. keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms, what can you say but always the best. Food, service and ambiance never fail to provide a 5 Star experience."}
{"text":"Love this place! I was here last Sunday with my mom for the first time. Not only is the service and food great, but sitting on the back patio I felt like I was transformed to a quaint spot in Italy! It's such a great ambiance and the food I tried was amazing too (I had the Cobb salad). Then afterward we checked out the coffee house/gift shop/pastry shop..so cute!! I'm definitely going to grab coffee there in the near future."}
{"text":"I brought my daughter here to share what has always been a delicious and lovely experience. Wrong this time! Our waitress, Janis, was never around and ignored all three of her tables on the front patio. We had to ask the hostess to find her so that we could place our order. She was fake friendly with an angry undertone. My warm vegetable chopped salad was brought out without any dressing but I had to wait until the waitress finally surfaced only because our neighboring table had to ask the hostess to find her so they could get their bill. Finally, Janis glanced at us & noticed that my beverage glass was completely empty and I mentioned lack of salad dressing. No apology.  A good 10-15 minutes after my salad had been brought to me, I was finally able to eat it!  My daughter was almost done with her meal by then. Then Janis forgot to give back the 3rd table's credit card but insisted she had.....whoops, she found it after the sweet patron frantically looked all through her purse. As I asked for my bill, Janis jammed a bill with attached credit card at me....not my credit card or my bill though!! I eventually located a young man who appeared to be managing and told him politely that we had very poor service. Friendly smile from him, but no sympathy. Well, in closing, the food was pretty good but the service was horrible. So sad, because I have always loved this place."}
{"text":"This review is NOT about the food! I walked into this placing assuming that it would be serving brunch and a beautiful Sunday afternoon but was dissapointed to find out that only lunch would be served. Also, the atmosphere was definitely not my style. Definitely an older crowd (50s and up) and very proper. I like to let loose at my breakfast table, talk loud and laugh louder! Definitely would not feel comfortable doing that here... Left and did not taste the food."}
{"text":"Server billed the strawberry chicken salad as \"amazing.\" No, it's not. It's greens, poppyseed dressing, hard not-in-season strawberries, cold chicken and non-toasted-enough almonds. I'd try something a little more interesting next time. Cute atmosphere. Asked to have it packed up 8 minutes ago. Still waiting."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. 10:30 on a Sunday \"we don't take walk in's\" meanwhile there are six empty tables in the place and I had to listen to you talk about sheet cakes for five minutes before you looked at me? Oh and better yet when you call to make a reservation they don't pick up the phone."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect spot for brunch with friends.  We had my birthday brunch here and they were extremely accommodating when we wanted to be seated in the sun which turned out to be lovely since it was such a beautiful day.  The breakfast food was delicious.  They give out little scones before your food comes out which was a life saver for us because we were all starving!  

I had the Egg Strada Cobbler which I didn't realize had chunks of bread in it but it definitely was NOT a deal breaker because it was so yummy, with chunks of tasty sausage and zucchini that was perfectly cooked along with melted cheese on top that sealed the deal (crispy cheesy bread along the side? yes please!).  Definitely a winner!

My friend had the Fresh Berry Crepe which was perfectly balanced and not too sweet.  Another had the Quesadilla which did not disappoint.  The only possible negatives were that my Kir Royal (raspberry with sparkling wine) was not as tasty as I would have liked, and we had a couple of people who don't eat pork and in certain dishes, such as the Egg Strada, they could not swap out the pork for chicken sausage because they were already mixed (the quesadilla was swap friendly just fyi).

Overall, I really loved the place with the great food, service and ambiance.  I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place had a great venue, a great menu, and the service was good. The food was absolutely amazing! A great place to take your ladies for lunch or mom for brunch! Super cute patio!"}
{"text":"I came here with my work colleagues to celebrate a birthday. While it definitely has the feel of a \"ladies who lunch\" place, I was impressed that they made sure to give us timely service so that we could get back to the office within a reasonable time.

I had a chicken cobb salad while my colleagues tried other items on the menu. Everyone was very pleased with their selections and my fresh-squeezed lemonade was great as well Our server was excellent and even took the time to ask where we worked.

The only drawback I saw was that if you're going to have valet parking in Scottsdale, shouldn't it be complimentary? Almost everywhere else does it that way, so I wasn't sure why it cost $3 here.

Other than that though, this is definitely a place to go for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Made reservations last minute on a Saturday for lunch later that afternoon via resy. Unfortunately upon arriving they didn't have record of our reservation eventhough I had the email confirmation, regardless they sat us immediately and apologized for the confusion. It was all uphill from there... The restaurant itself was beautiful, offering both inside and outside dining. The service was outstanding, very attentive and walked us through the menu since it was our first time dining there. We went with the pesto grilled shrimp salad and herb roasted chicken sandwich with potato salad, both were delicious and packed with so much flavor. We were beyond full from the meal and didn't get a chance to try any of their desserts or pastries, we will definitely be back to try their brunch menu in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is filled with about 95 estrogen most of the time, which is generally a little bit too much for me, but I love Arcadia Farms in small doses. 

The setting is beautiful & the patio is perfect when the weather is nice. I have never had a bad meal here either.

So why can I take this place only in small doses? Well, as my friend described it, you are surrounded by groups of clucking hens. That is how he describes the tables full of loud women. I agree, I can only take so much chatter from tables full of loud women, drunk off $15 glasses of wine.

The ladies who lunch & brunch as a profession are here in full effect, so if you can take a restaurant full of them & prices that are slightly too high, come here to enjoy great food & people watching.

Just don't say I didn't warn you. ;)"}
{"text":"This is literally the first review I have ever written. I came here for lunch, and I loved it so much that I arranged my schedule so I could come back the next day for breakfast. Everything was absolutely top notch -- I had the shrimp pesto salad when I went there for lunch and the black bean omelette when I went there for breakfast. Both were delicious!

But it was the atmosphere and the service that got me to write this review. I sat outside both days. The music was sort of acoustic jazzy-sounding covers -- I asked about it and it's apparently a brunch playlist on Spotify -- so there's that. When I was there for lunch, apparently a huge to-go order came in shortly before I arrived and a lot of the meals were delayed. While we were waiting, the waitress came around and gave everyone the most delicious cookie samples -- lemon and chocolate (with caramel, I think) -- to snack on while we were waiting. I was already loving the overall vibe and experience, but I thought that was a great gesture, and it helped that the cookies were so darn yummy.

I wouldn't come here with a toddler unless you know they like that sort of thing, and I wouldn't come if you are looking for a quick bite before you have to be somewhere else. But if you want a dining experience with yummy food, delightful staff and attentive service, this is your place. I went by myself, but it would be a great spot to catch up with an old friend or to hang out with a group of people you love to talk to and enjoy great meals with."}
{"text":"Such a great a place!!! What a gem!!!  The food is absolutely amazing, drinks were great and service is an A+!"}
{"text":"What a quaint little place in the middle of Scottsdale. Beautiful garden in the back where you can have a nice lunch."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we weren't disappointed. Absolutely charming inside and out. We were there for breakfast and the food was delicious and service was attentive. My husband and I will certainly make this a regular stop and we look forward to trying dinner and wine here soon."}
{"text":"i cant say anything less than glowing reviews of this cafe. it was a warm day, we were visiting from vegas and were sent here by an art gallery down the street. we sat on the patio in this adorable cottage type cafe under trees umbrellas and a lovely cool mist was so refreshing that cooled us off. little birds chirrping around the trees and a nice waitress. had a peach wine cocktail and the chicken quesidillia with guac for dipping. it was the most delicious lunch i have ever had in my life. i swear i would drive 5.5 hours from vegas just to eat HERE. deliciousssss."}
{"text":"This place is so cute!! Food was delicious and fresh. Great place to bring a group of girlfriends for lunch. Definitely will be returning to try some more items on the menu:)"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere. ....the breakfast was good but OVERPRICED, small portions.  Considering all the other breakfast places in the area, we probably won't return. We were seated promptly but, after that, the service was very slow!"}
{"text":"i am very impressed with this place. The unique decor and inside/ outside set up of tables was a nice change from the ordinary. This place feels like a cottage--- very homey. For lunch on a Saturday, the place was packed-- i think we sat at the last open seat. The deserts are VERY tasty and homemade in house. If the weather is nice, sit outside!"}
{"text":"Very frustrated.  No service. One lady trying to make coffee.  We waited ten minutes and with no one coming to serve us or the people in front of us we gave up"}
{"text":"Good consistent food, but our server disappeared halfway through lunch. Lemon cookie was dry."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch while on vacation. It was nice to sit outside, but service wasn't good, and one of two poached eggs was completely overcooked. The potatoes were basically unseasoned, which made for a really boring meal that could've been much better."}
{"text":"This place is excellent and NEVER seems to be busy. The AF breakfast sandwich is filling and tasty - homemade crispy English muffin, lots of egg and cheese with a little bit of tangy mayo, husband and I prefer it with ham over the bacon. Every pastry I've ever had is excellent as well (lemon cake cookie was SO moist, strawberry scone perfectly lightly sweet, chocolate chip cookies have just the right amount of crisp around the edges but are mostly gooey and chocolatey...) and the service is always friendly. And of course it's so charming, seating indoors and out, and they have their own parking lot so it's easy to pop in and grab something. I've also had the turkey Brie and Apple sandwich which is served on awesome walnut bread with a touch of fig jam - yum. You can tell everything is made in house and with so much love and attention. I plan on bringing all of our out of town visitors here. The only bummer is that they are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Just returned from a great mothers day lunch with my wife and in-laws.  It was our first time here and the restaurant was a real winner!  Great atmosphere and the food quality was fantastic.  They had a fixed menu for the occasion today but the selections covered a wide range of tastes.  My wife is a vegetarian and was pleasantly surprised that there were several items for her to chose.  She had the crape and just loved it!  The salmon dish I selected was a good portion and was cooked to perfection - moist and flavorful.  For desert the coconut cake is a cant miss choice.  We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Love this sweet little place. Food delicious, ambience lovely. Can't give 5 stars tho because our waitress wasn't that great. Completely ignored us when we decided to stay a few minutes longer even tho I had tipped her 30%. She could have offered to refill our waters. It wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"seating was very nice in a courtyard and food was quite good. however,service was not so good/--asked for dressing on the side but it came on the salad anyway. the waitress said she would get our bill, but then disappeared for a long time--I finally had to get up and track her down. also, bought some things. In their shop next door, and found out later that one could get a 10. Percent discount with the lunch bill,but was never informed about this at the restaurant"}
{"text":"Great for brunch! Nice beverage list and food options for all. Start with some baked goods. Check out the store after your meal. Outdoor dining options."}
{"text":"Amazing little restaurant tucked away in old town Scottsdale. Great food, great service. The peach ice tea is fantastic. Coming here again!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is consistently good and we really enjoy the back patio. It is built around a large tree with lots of umbrellas nearby. You're outside but feels protected like the inside. It's a nice balance. There are some small birds that fly and hop around but they are enjoyable.  It was an April morning so the weather wasn't too hot and still permitted patio seating. 

Service seems a little slow but worth it for the top notch meals and it is a comfortable environment to relax and wait. We had the Pulled Pork and requested it with the eggs over-medium rather than scrambled. They did a great job!  We also ordered the Berry Crepes which was more like dessert since it was so sweet, but definitely delicious. The complimentary scones were a delight at the beginning of the meal. The Darjeeling tea and Mimosas were a delight. Have been here before and will be back. We live nearby and have lots of choices. This is one of our favs!"}
{"text":"There are many places in this town that have a great menu or a piece of local flare or maybe a cool patio, but there are few establishments that offer all of the above and fresh quality ingredients, a decent 'casual afternoon' wine list and kick-ass iced tea and lemonade with a splash of femininity all over it. 

This cutie-little-space celebrates being a woman. 

With all due respect, I would never want to have a date take me to Arcadia Farms, nor would I suggest it, because this is where I come with my girlfriends to talk about our most recent 'dates.' Or, this is the place where you take your new date's mom, or for a baby shower, bridal shower, or a woman's 21st, 30th, or 37th birthday (that's a hint that I have a birthday soon...)! 

Even the service and ambiance is perfectly female - oh, and before I forget the baked goods that greet you as you walk in the front door seem to fit my waistline better than the date I would never bring there anyway...

Aracadia Farms makes it oh-so-good-to-be-a-woman!"}
{"text":"My kind of place...
Thanks to Gabi M I first discovered the loveliness of Arcadia Farms about a year ago. We dined on their beautiful outdoor patio while enjoying healthy salads. I ordered the Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad, which was fabulous until I had an allergic reaction to it and spent 20 min throwing up in the bathroom. Lovely, I know.  Arcadia Farms isn't to blame though because I'm allergic to everything!

Last week we skipped out on the beautiful atmosphere and picked up our salads to go. Of course I stayed away from the shrimp salad this time and went with some sort of grilled chicken salad. I ate up every last bite and no allergic reactions this time around. Whoo hoo!

Based on the ambiance and food it's clear why this is many a yelpers favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast several times. I love how cute this place is! Great place to take mom! The stratta is fantastic and their baked goods have never disappointed and I'm picky about baked goods. The chocolate toffee muffin belongs in my belly everytime they have it there."}
{"text":"My review is based on my breakfast experience only. my boyfriend and I decided to check out Arcadia farms but our experience didn't live up to all the positive reviews. I had the two eggs any style and my boyfriend had the French toast. My dish was pretty dry tasting and only tasted better with the addition of lots of ketchup. We both thought our entrees were just ok but not great. I would come back for their baked pastries though... The strawberry cream scone was delicious!"}
{"text":"I had a lovely Sunday lunch at Arcadia Farms Cafe with my husband and two friends, during a weekend visit to Phoenix. It was a charming little restaurant, with the feel of a rich old white lady's house--greenery and white picket fences outside, white furniture, white tablecloths, and gingham prints inside. The vibe was calm and relaxing in an upscale kind of way--like this would be a great place for a fancy tea party. I had a glass of red sangria with my lunch, and that felt right, too.

The food was excellent--fresh, clean, farm-to-table kind of fare. We ordered some warm brie with caramelized apples to share, and this was a wonderful appetizer, the cheese baked soft and gooey, the apples the perfect sweetness, all served with crusty toasted baguette. I got the roasted salmon \"super\" salad for my lunch, and it was perfectly executed. The salmon was ideally moist and flaky, and it came over a bed of farro, kale, radicchio, red onion, chickpeas, and cherry tomato, with a tarragon dressing. I loved all the textures, and every element was inherently flavorful. I very rarely order salads for meals, but this was one I'd get again and again. My husband got a modified ham and cheese sandwich (the kitchen graciously made it more kid-friendly for my 32-year-old boy) with the potato salad on the side, which I ate with enthusiasm. It was a phenomenally good potato salad, with firm, fingerling potatoes in a flavorful dill dressing.

Arcadia Farms is across the street from the Poisoned Pen bookstore, which is my destination whenever I come to Phoenix. I'm happy to have a go-to place for lunch in the area, and look forward to my next Arcadia Farms meal."}
{"text":"Probably up there in the worst sandwiches ever category. We chose to go to the marketplace and eat outside at the tables. 
Baked Ham and Cheese - Miserable deli style ham. No lettuce, tomato etc.
Chicken and Brie - looked like it was made by a child. Pulled chicken, a few onions and way too much brie on hard bread

Both sandwiches were 9 bucks, but did not include a side or even a pickle. 
One of the women who took my order also was enjoying stuffing her face in the back when I returned for to-go (to the garbage) box.

The extra star is for the soft pumpkin cookie we shared for three bucks."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I had the turkey and Brie sandwich, OMG seriously, so good. I just wanted more. The good news' the potato salad the sandwich came with, was equally fantastic. I left full and happy. I will be going back for this sandwich!! They lost a start because of service (one of the waitress' friends was at a table, and she kept just sitting and talking to her, meanwhile we had empty water glasses on a hot day), and also, prices are kinda high. Mostly a great experience here, we will be back."}
{"text":"I love the patio! The food is good and fresh and its very peaceful atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but I didn't. 

If you book a reservation here, make sure you get here early. If you are even a few minutes late, they will give your table to people that are waiting and tell you to go to their marketplace. Yup, that happened to us.

We waited for a few members of our group before walking in together and waited in a line for the hostess. Parking is not the greatest so some of us had to walk a bit from our cars. We were about 5 minutes late when we got in line and by the time we got to the hostess, it was 9 minutes past our reservation time. She seemed a bit flustered and by the time she decided to tell us she gave up our table, it was 10 minutes past. Most restaurants would hold your table for 10-15 minutes. She told us we could get food from their marketplace but we actually wanted to enjoy a nice sit-down meal. I mean... that's why we had a reservation. She decides she can seat us after looking at the restaurant. I thought it was especially odd because they had a bunch of empty tables indoors and outside the entire time we were there.

Anyway, we get sat and never had anyone greet us at the table for 10+ minutes. I stopped a server to ask if we had a server and they said yes and our server walked past to let us know he would be over soon. The hostess sees our table (after 15 minutes) without any waters so she grabs us some. We were a bit distracted because we were catching up but I definitely noticed the timing. 

3 of us order mimosas and it took a bit longer because they ran out of fruit and flutes. We end up with wine glasses, which was totally fine. 

We decided to start with the bread pudding and it was actually pretty yummy! I believe it was made with croissants. We also ordered a chocolate croissant to share and I wished it was flakier and less chewier.

For my entree, I went with the wild mushroom, goat cheese & leek tart. I saw it on Yelp prior to our brunch so I had been eyeing it up all morning. It showed up overcooked but I ate it (See photo). I was starving. It came with some breakfast potatoes and fruit. I wouldn't order it again based off my experience.

The others enjoyed their meals. One of us got the Egg Strata Cobbler and I enjoyed a bite of it so if I decide to give this place a try again, I would get that. Another went with the Breakfast Quesadilla and she liked it. The birthday girl got the Wild Mushroom and Chive Omelet.  

Our server was actually really nice but we could tell he was a bit flustered. He brought the birthday girl a cute cupcake with a candle and extra utensils to share but we were all so stuffed. This place is a big 'maybe' on my list to be revisited because I had heard so many good things before my visit."}
{"text":"The service was great. The waitress was attentive enough but not overly. 

The food was mostly fine with the exception being the bacon. It came out burned. It wasn't like accidently burned. Judging from the other plates this is how they cook the bacon."}
{"text":"The food and service was fantastic, such wonderful atmosphere and an adorable spot!  I cannot wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Outstanding great \"country cottage\" in the heart of Scottsdale!  Outstanding menu with a variety of gourmet delights to choose from. We had crape's, salads, sandwiches and crab cakes. All were excellent and the service is was outstanding. If Andrea is your server you are in for a treat she is wonderful."}
{"text":"We were very lucky to snag a table at the last minute on Friday at noon.  But I was so disappointed that they were no longer serving breakfast.  Bummer.

The atmosphere was very girls do lunch.  And it was a beautiful day, so if you can get a table outside grab it, or make reservations.

I am not an avocado lover, so I could have done without the crab tower, but my kids love it.
The mushroom spinach tart was delicious as was the grilled salmon and Turkey Brie sandwich.  But the highlight was the Tuxedo Baby cake and the lemon cookie.  Both melt in your mouth.

Was a tad disappointed in the baby carrot cake  but  I'd come here again if in the area."}
{"text":"My mom and I finally made it to the Ansel Adam's exhibit at the Phoenix Art Museum -- on its final day, no less -- and after perusing his beautiful photography, we were ready to get a bite to eat. I'd heard about the Arcadia Farms Cafe in the museum, and thought this was the perfect opportunity to give it a try.

It was a quaint cafe -- not too big, not too small, and if it was a lovely fall or spring day, I could see myself really enjoying the outdoor patio.  Nevertheless, the floor to ceiling windows offered a lovely view of the unusual and quirky sculptures spotting the museum grounds. 

My mom and I were seated promptly, but it seemed to take a bit longer than usual before our waitress finally arrived to take our drink order.  After that it was a bit more of a wait before we received our simple water order and placed our meal order.  And then, again, we waited what seemed a bit too long for our simple sandwiches to arrive. It wasn't that big of a deal, since it gave me time to chat with my mom about the photography we just viewed.

I had the tomato, basil and mozzarella sandwich and my mom (if I remember correctly) had their signature strawberry and chicken salad. I do remember distinctly my mom telling me she LOVED the vinaigrette, and my sandwich was quite delicious, although I have to say I could have done with a little less mozzarella -- it kind of overpowered the sandwich and left me feeling over-cheesed.

Despite it being a bit pricey for a lunch spot ($14 for a salad?!) and the slightly long wait, I had a nice experience at Arcadia Farms, and I would love to try some of their other dishes on my next visit. Plus, I would love to take advantage of their Sunday brunch and a mimosa or two with some girlfriend."}
{"text":"Love coming here for brunch. I prefer seating outside, it makes me feel like I'm not in Arizona. Love the vibe, very classy but still relaxed at the same time! I ordered the wild mushroom tart and it is very flavorful. I believe it came with a side salad and that was even very tasty as well. I recommend ordering the warm Brie and caramelized apples --- wow! Definitely a must for cheese lovers. I did order the crab and avocado tower and that was a little bit disappointing -- there wasn't anything special about it and it was just ok. I've been on a weekday and weekends and I've never really had a problem finding a seat! Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Although most of the reviews I have read seemed to say that this restaurant is \"girlie,\" my boyfriend and I had a really nice breakfast there this Saturday.  We went a bit later (10:30AM), hoping to miss most of the breakfast crowd but...that is why I am unable to give them five (5) stars: our meal was a bit slow.  However, the waitress addressed it before we needed to say anything, and offered to pay for our muffin \"appetizer.\"

The service was great: attentive and friendly, although, like I said, the meal came slow.

The atmosphere is just beautiful; we really enjoyed the misting on the front patio.  And, if it makes a difference to those reading this, there was more testosterone at the table behind us.

The price isn't bad either.

It was just a really nice way to start our Saturday.

Oh, and we just learned that they are starting dinner service as well."}
{"text":"We were in old town and decided to finally try Arcadia Farms.  Service was very good and efficient.  Enjoyed eating on the patio on a beautiful day.

My wife and I tried three dishes.  The Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad, Chicken, Wild Mushroom and Leek Crepes and the Lump Crab Cake dish.  The crepe dish had too much sauce and the shrimp salad was served with only four small shrimp.  The crab cakes were good, definitely had better.  If you have been to Maryland, don't even try to compare the crab cakes.  Apples to oranges.  The food was fresh, flavor was good but not great.  

The menu is definitely overpriced for the size of the dishes and quality of the food."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful, I felt like I was in a true French cafe. It was a pleasant day and it wasn't too busy. Our server was super nice and attentive, she even gave us complimentary scones! The food was delicious and fresh and the atmosphere was calm and classy. 10/10."}
{"text":"Loved it. Match.com first meeting. Casual elegance with fab appetizers. 

Highly recommend and I will be back on many occasions."}
{"text":"I'm a bit disappointed in myself for not visiting Arcadia Farms sooner. I've lived in Arizona long enough that a meal here should have been a priority long ago! Better late than never, I suppose.

To all who live in the Valley, you know how exciting it is when the weather takes a turn for the better and the thought of eating a meal on a lovely patio makes you jump out of your chair. This place has that whimsical patio that you could sit on and drink mimosas for hours. The service was very good and the food was delicious. My sister and I both had the wild mushroom tart which was savory, satisfying and oh-so-good. The only reason I am not giving Arcadia five stars is because I have to be a bit of a vegetarian snob. There weren't that many veggie options (at least for brunch), I think only two or three menu items. 

I look forward to to returning here to check out their breakfast and will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem of Scottsdale. Not many people know about it but brunch is fantastic. 

I get the Wild Mushroom and Chive omelet every time with goat cheese. Breakfast potatoes are good but I'm not a huge fan of rosemary. I love restaurants that offer cottage cheese as a side. 

Coffee is good and they serve you little sconces to start. Coffee cake is also yummy. 

Everything I've had here is good! Breakfast quesadilla is also yummy - salsa has a good kick. 

I noticed that sometimes it's hard to make a reservation online but the restaurant usually isn't full. Don't be afraid to walk in for a tabe."}
{"text":"Such an amazing place the ambience may I say is on point. I came with a group friends we were seated outside. We were greeted by our waitress who was so nice and also gave us good advice of what to try on the menu. I ordered a chicken quesadilla which was perfection and it came with fresh-made guacamole and salsa. I have such a sweet tooth so I had to order dessert to end my day. The dessert everyone should order is the tuxedo cake it is to die for."}
{"text":"What a wonderfully cute place this is, with a huge sparkling outdoor patio to the quaint cozy interior seating this place will continue to be a lunch hit in downtown Scottsdale.  We had a tasty selection as well, from a steamy hearty chicken tortilla soup to the large chicken club sandwich on focaccia bread.  This is a gem!"}
{"text":"Very nice place for a low-key birthday celebration. Per some of the other reviews here on Yelp the place is girl-heaven. Plants, dark wood, comfy booths and tables. Your eyes and taste buds are tantalized by delicious-looking baked goods on display just inside the door. 

There were some excellent choices on the wine list, including Klinker Brick Cab. Mmmm. 

Many of the menu choices sounded good. Plenty of salads, sandwiches and other tasty sounding entrees. I had a tart of caramelized leeks, mushrooms and spinach. The pastry was flaky and the filling was fresh and flavorful. On the plate was an assorted greens salad with a very tasty lime vinaigrette. 

It wasn't super-cheap, but not outrageous either. Lunch with two good glasses of wine, two entrees and a \"baby cake\" to celebrate my big day. The total tab came to around $60.

My friend and I intend to go back when the weather is cooler and enjoy the charming greenery-filled patio."}
{"text":"The food was good and fresh, but wasn't the most amazing thing I've had before. Most of the pastries we were hoping to try, they were out of which was one of the reasons we went there. When we tried to make a reservation for 11 people, they only allow a maximum of 4 people per reservation when making it online, and state that we should call if we have more people, the problem is that nobody ever answers the phone there. They have a voicemail mailbox for reservations which states that they will call back right away to confirm which they never did, and a general mailbox for anything else. So you literally can't get ahold of a real person when calling to make a reservation. So we made 3 separate reservations using Yelp under different names and put in the notes that it was for 11 people and that we did it this way because nobody called us back. Also, a few of us asked for Diet Coke which is on the menu, but they brought a Coke Zero instead, which for one of us is fine, but not everyone likes the taste of Coke Zero. They should have told us that they didn't have Diet Coke up front."}
{"text":"This quaint cafe was a pleasant experience but overall nothing too outstanding. The music and decor made for a nice relaxing ambiance either inside or outside of the cafe. The service was decent but our food did take a few minutes longer than expected to come out. The menu doesn't have too many options but what we did order was good. The decent prices and warm ambiance would incite me to return for maybe pastries and drinks."}
{"text":"First I must preface this review in saying that I have never actually been to the restaurant but my work caters in from here for the children.  My review is based solely on the food brought in for the children specifically.

I've noticed that a lot of the food from this place is nice, but at the same time, some foods are not - especially for children.  

For example, one day the company will have a very kid friendly meal such as pizza, but with weird chunks of mozzarella.  Most of the children don't care for the chunks so we're spending lunch picking off the cheese. Other meals that the kids don't like are the cold cheese sandwiches.  Literally, it's just bread, maybe 3-5 pieces of cheese and that's it. Not a whole lot. I've actually had a child say no to their cheese sandwich and begged us to provide him with cheese and crackers.  Every so often they will bring in macaroni that is just gross even to look at.  The pasta is nasty and overcooked and the cheese has no flavor. 

I like when they bring in turkey, mashed potatoes and corn.  Their chicken and rice is pretty good. Their spaghetti and meatballs look a lot better than the canned stuff from the grocery store. 

I have heard that the restaurant is much better and hopefully one day I'll stop in and see for myself."}
{"text":"I go to the market place often. It's a quick and easy place to pick up my lunch. The food is fresh and made to order every day. It is my go to place when I need a pick me up during the work week. All of the staff is cute young friendly young ladies. However, the last time I went a girl with red hair was very condescending to the both of us. It made me not want to go back. I did not like the way she called elderly customers sweetie and honey. She seemed bothered to serve our food to us outside and would fake a smile and go off and talk about us to the valet outside. Not a great time and the market place but I will still be back"}
{"text":"Great food a little pricey but I loved the ambiance:) and the coffee was great too! Go early so you can get a parking spot."}
{"text":"I took my sis-in-law there yesterday for her 60th birthday.  It was the first time there for both of us.  We both loved it!  We split the Strawberry Chicken Salad and the Mediterranean Melt Sandwich.  The split if for us.  We topped it off with a piece of carrot cake.  The presentation of all of the food was so appealing.  The waitress was so accommodating with my broken ankle and happily took a picture of us together.  She gave us good entree recommendations.  We were there for quite a while and she never complained.  I gave her a good tip.  I will totally go back again and again and bring other friends and family.  It's been around for about 20 years.  Be aware that parking is limited so you might need to do valet parking for $3 plus tip."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but the service was terrible. Don't come here if you are even moderately in a hurry. Allow plenty of time for a leisurely brunch. I had the breakfast panini and my husband had the spinach and tomato omelet. Both were great. I wanted a mimosa but felt that $9 for a small mimosa was quite a bit over priced so I passed"}
{"text":"This place is just OK.

Our waitress was a nice young lady and attended us well.

The feel of the restaurant is very much like any museum eatery. 

The food was simply uninspired, not bad, but not good. 

So it is just OK..."}
{"text":"Sometimes when I eat I enjoy going out on my own. As a concierge at one of the hotels in old town Scottsdale it is important to me to try all the restaurants in town so I have places to recommend. based on my experience Arcadia farms is off that list.

So today I passed a test I've preparing for for over a year and thought it would be great to celebrate with a delicious meal at a place I've wanted to try for so long now! I walked in to arcadia farms market place first and the girl working was so sweet and helpful. I should have just eaten there. I didnt eat there though because I really wanted to sit down with a mimosa (my favorite) and enjoy a meal. 

As I walked in to the restaurant the hostess looked at me like I was crazy when I told her it was just me. she had to process the fact that I was a solo diner for a good minute. I asked if I could sit outside and she sat me in a spot directly in the sun. I was so hot! Arcadia farms looks adorable and the menu looked fantastic so I figured I could be a little warm as long as I had a cold beverage. I sat, and I sat and I sat. Still no server, no water, no anything. I sat for a good 15 minutes at least. I even witnessed the table next to me get helped twice and the table across from me was served drinks and had their orders taken from the women that sat me.  

Needless to say I got up and left without the meal I've been hoping for for so long. 15 minutes without even water on the table is laughable. Apparently eating alone is not acceptable at Arcadia Farms. I considered going back to order at the market place but I honestly don't want to give the company my money at all anymore. I went to eat down the street and had a wonderful experience with water on my table faster than arcadia farms hostess could even say hello.

I will never be back and I will never recommend this place to my guests."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms is unique to Phoenix with a country French ambience without being \"cute-sy.\" The patio is one of the loveliest we have here in Scottsdale. My daughter and I celebrated an early Mother's Day here recently. We were seated in just the right spot on the patio to tuck my grandson and his stroller in a corner next to the table. We splurged on some white sangria for lunch.....so pretty it had it's photo posted on Facebook. The Brie and Carmelized apples also came with grapes and strawberries and it was a very large serving of cheese. It could easily be a meal or feed 4 as an appetizer. We actually ran out of bread, because the Brie wheel was a nice large serving. The smoked ham sandwiches on crusty baguette are so good that I am craving them a few days later ....we used the still-warm gooey Brie on them, too. This place is just special! Plan an event, take a guest. It is a spot that will make it memorable. This was my first lunch as a new Grandmother with my daughter. My daughter is from the beach area in SCal, and she was wow'd. Thanks for the memories.......beautiful day."}
{"text":"I've lived in old town for 5 years and somehow just heard about this place. I'm a little embarrassed about that because of how much I love to eat brunch.

The other reviews are quite accurate, so I'll keep it brief. There will be lots of older ladies with hats. But they go there because the food and ambiance are exactly what you need for the perfect Sunday brunch. I got a made-to-order omelette and loved it. My date got blueberry crepes and she was raving about it. This is a foofy brunch spot, but even the guy's guys would do well to mix in brunch here occasionally. 

If you're looking for the most \"brunchy\" brunch spot in town, this is the place. Or if your mom or grandma is in town, this is where you should take them."}
{"text":"Sitting outside in the sun is wonderful ....... Although in the summer this would be miserable winter is great

The wait for the food was particularly long, just under 30 minutes.    We did not have any special requests apart from no cheese or dressing on the salad. 

When the food came it was good"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast whole visiting a local.  Delicious omelets and friendly service.  We were there 2 hours catching up and they never rushed us.  I really appreciated the service from James.  I highly recommend and can't wait to go back on my next visit."}
{"text":"Amazing farm to table food. Nothing on the menu is crazy out there or super insanely creative. It is more of the typical breakfast foods but with high quality ingredients. 

The service was super weird and I was on the fence between a 3 and a 4 star rating because of the strange service. When we went to order we were disallowed to let the women at the table order first and we had to arbitrary order in an order that the server required. I don't get this at all. Then she gave us some scones and weirdly said...\"the last of the scones.\" Not sure if she was trying to be funny or something strange but it made our entire table rethink trying them. Were they stale or were they going to throw away these improperly baked scones? What was so wrong with them that they were the last of the scones? 

The worst part was the strange location of the mens and womens bathroom. Not a complete deal breaker but the women's bathroom was clogged so everyone was using the single serving men's bathroom. I decided against waiting in the huge line of women gathered in front of the men's room and went down the street to Starbucks. Very weird and I then realized why I could get a reservation for 5 people on a Sunday at prime brunch time. This place just kept missing the target. 

Good food but everything else was way off."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend of mine and we were looking for a new place to try for lunch. I found Arcadia Farms Cafe. It was a bit hard to find a parking spot, but completely worth it! We enjoyed everything we had, including the white Sangria! YUM! I also highly recommend the small cakes. Caution: they are extremely delicious!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't found this place sooner!  I was impressed from the ambiance to the menu.  Will definitely be back and will definitely try there small cakes next time!"}
{"text":"Brunch here was awesome!  We sat outside on the patio at this charming little 'house.'

A few of us shared the Strawberry and Cream Scone, Fresh Berry Crepes, Egg Strada Cobbler and Wild Mushroom, Spinach and Leek Quiche.  Surprisingly, my least favorite item were the crepes (I usually love anything and everything sweet).  The Sweet Mascarpone Cheese was overkill, otherwise it could have been a nice, light sweet option.

The Quiche was my favorite and the Cobbler was a close second.  Both savory dishes were full of fresh veggies, cheese and seasoned perfectly.

Our waitress was wonderful, too.  She handled our large group perfectly, and was very accomodating to one of the girls who wasn't feeling so great.

Perfect place for a relaxing, cozy brunch."}
{"text":"I LOVE lunch dates at Arcadia Farms. They have the most delicious {LARGE} salads! On my last visit, I got the warm chopped vegetable salad (asparagus, roasted red peppers, zucchini, grilled corn, radicchio, romaine, lime vinaigrette) + chicken + avocado + goat cheese. (I know, i'm so high maintenance!) ;) But it was so yummy! This is a fabulous place to impress colleagues on a business lunch, celebrate birthdays with girlfriends, baby showers, bridal showers, brunch with your mother-in-law, you name it! Arcadia Farms has such a classy vibe and I can't wait to be dine here again soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I were very excited to try this place and while most of the food was good, it lacked the flavors my taste buds were hoping for. The crepes were the best entrée we had, the hummus was dry, the sandwiches were also very dry (like when you scrape the top of your mouth). The worst though, was the service. I understand they get very busy there, but I saw plenty of servers. Our waitress was extremely pushy saying she wasn't leaving the table until we ordered, which she did, so while we sat there trying to figure out what we were ordering she stood over us. Once we got our bill we never saw her again, we sat with empty water's, tea and lemonade the rest of the time even when she picked up our card. Overall, I won't be spending my money at this established ever again."}
{"text":"Great little quaint restaurant in a little house. Great for bdays or baby or bridal showers. Unfortunately the staff are not the greatest. We brought a cake for a 21 bday and was scolded. I understand maybe it isn't allowed to bring a cake put it was very rudely handled. And upon asking for a more intimate table i even got an eye roll. Too bad it isn't about the customer. Even for a special occasion. I have been there in the past and saw decorations and balloons and cake brought in from another place.  Not sure what was the deal today!!!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to Arcadia. I had been here for lunch (which was delicious ). This visit was for breakfast. I ordered the omelet with mushrooms and herbs that comes with a side of country potatoes. 

It was not good. The omelet was very bland and the potatoes tasted like they were processed and previously frozen. Overall, the meal was very disappointing. 

The server was attentive and friendly, the ambiance is comfy and inviting but the meal fell short. 

Probably won't return for breakfast."}
{"text":"It saddens me how such a charming place can create so much disappointment. Right off the bat I felt unwelcome--I was excited to get a spot right in front for convenience for getting my toddler out of the car--but was promptly told that it wasn't a parking spot and that it was only for customers getting take-out. If this is the case then put up some signs. I had a terrible experience here a few weeks ago but decided to give it another try. Julia is wonderful although she is clearly spread thin and has to be the employee constantly making up for the mistakes of the kitchen and her coworkers. The way this place is run is laughable. It does not give the indication that the customer comes first--rather that the owners are money-hungry snobs. It's time to work out the kinks and get it together!! Your kitchen is disastrously slow and your staff clearly has trouble with consistency and communication. You need to get someone in there to actually \"manage\" this place. This is so obviously not a finely oiled machine. So sad :( NEVER. GOING. BACK."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms at the Phoenix Art Museum is one of the best kept secrets down town.  Fresh, tasty and beautiful food in a classy quiet but energetic atmosphere.  Wonderful wine list, and yummy desserts! The parking is easy and free and if you are a museum member, bring your card for a 10% discount off of your bill. This is a terrific spot to go if you need a place to meet for a business lunch.  The museum is wonderful too."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Incredible baked good. I mean amazing ! I love their coffee and the outdoor seating is great.  Friendly service and good prices. Oh, and delightful merchandise. I would give it 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"um wow

i was a bit nervous trying this place for lunch since everyone says it's so slow but we took a risk and we told our waitress we were on a lunch break. she was so awesome about it! we were in and out of there in an hour, with to-go iced teas to boot. 

seriously awesome! like, so awesome we went twice in a row. this is a frequenter.

i had the roasted chicken with tomatoes, spinach and artichoke with a side salad. it was delicious. 

my friend had the mushroom and chicken crepes which she said were insane. and our other friend had the shrimp salad, also good. but from my eyes i would say my meal and the crepe meal looked the most delicious. 

i wish my backyard looked like their patio. im going to spend the rest of my afternoon pretending i'm still out there relaxing."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the food and service! I left The Phoenician to eat here instead. The crepes and bean omelette were delicious! Love the decor!"}
{"text":"Pleasant restaurant with a variety of rooms. Farm fresh food is always better than frozen. Great place to relax and talk with your table mate."}
{"text":"I went there on a Mon around 9:30 am. It was a ghost town and we got seated very quick.

I have to say they have the most comfortable seats!  I didnt sit in the chair but a like bench couch thing? Super soft.

The whole decor and music vibe was really cool, I really dugg it.

My girlfriend got  french toast (because she is a bitch and has to be super toned and fit with out working out or eating good)
which came with chicken apple sausage. Ok, heres the thing about that, I hate sausage(insert lesbian joke here) but it didnt have the typical sausagy flavors. It was really  really good. It was tangy salty and sweet. 
The french toast was extremely good. I think it may have been dipped in blueberry before cooked?

The waitress was super accomodating, and nice. 

Oh and they do have french press coffee which I was disappointed by , but after I had it.. holly crap best coffee ever!!!! it was smooth had good flavors, no bitterness at all. 

The only use butter and vegetable oil which is soo nice to see they dont load you up with horrible for you margerine. 

My only complaint is, I ordered a sandwich and got a totally different one. When I told them she went to the cooks and found out they didnt have that bread and randomly added egg? 

She took it back and it was no big deal but she informed me it was only a month old and were still learning the menu. 

Kinda weird but nothing big, my new favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"This review is for lunch: ordered the wild mushroom tart, a rasberry champagne drink, and chocolate pecan pie.  

The tart was delicious minus the excessive salt.  The side salad was perfect with fresh ingredients. 

Desert--I am not a huge desert person but thoroughly enjoyed this one.

Only downside is that breakfast ends early, even on a Sunday."}
{"text":"If renowned Old Town Scottsdale restaurant Cafe Monarch had a little breakfast and lunch sibling, Arcadia Farms would fit the mold.  Or at least the Cafe portion of this operation would.  That said, Arcadia Farms is more of a complex than anything else.  First an foremost, Arcadia Farms is a restaurant and cafe.  Next door, the Marketplace sells assorted baked goods, cookbooks, and knick knacks.  And surrounding the cafe and marketplace are various private dining rooms that are used frequently for big groups (my sister actually used one of them for a baby shower not too long ago).  As for me, I just wanted a good breakfast on a Sunday morning and I'd never tried Arcadia Farms.  At the opening bell, I was their first Sunday customer that morning.

I should cop to the fact that as soon as I arrived, I immediately felt underdressed.  Based on the Google street images of the Cafe front patio I fully expected my usual shorts, t-shirt, and sandals combo to be adequate attire.  While the Cafe staff didn't implicitly or explicitly judge me on it, the customers that poured in later that morning were all in their Sunday best.  Thus my unshaven, baseball cap wearing self stuck out like a sore thumb.  Nevertheless, I grabbed a seat near the front and pressed on.  The Cafe has a small amount of seating inside, but the emphasis here is definitely the patios that line the front, side, and back of the restaurant.  I'd guess at least 2/3rds of the seating here is outside, which is great as long as the weather is cool as it was this morning.  And as others have pointed out, the interior restaurant is akin to a sitting in a contemporary living room, which is really where the Cafe Monarch comparison comes in from my experience.  Its more laid back than Cafe Monarch, but it still evokes a cozy, romantic feel similar to Monarch.

I started with a standard glass of OJ before taking a gander at the menu.  I'd peeked into the Marketplace before walking into the Cafe for breakfast so I knew I wanted to grab something from the bakery to start with.  I asked for their Homemade Cinnamon and & Pecan Rugalach out of pure curiosity, but unfortunately the bakery didn't have any available.  So instead the waitress grabbed me a pair of Strawberry N'Cream Scone bites and made them complimentary.  They were still warm and soft upon arriving at my table.  A nice fruity, savory snack to start things off (and that was nice of them to make it free).  Next up, I'd read the hype about their housemade granola parfait so I ordered one of those.  It's served in a tall wine glass and includes assorted berries (mine had raspberries, strawberries, and I think rhubarb?), vanilla yogurt, and granola mixed with dried apricots.  It lived up to the hype.  Smooth, creamy dish with a great mix of tartness contrasted by the mellow crunch of the granola.  Most would be perfectly happy with this as their breakfast for the day.  But I wanted to try one more item.  On their \"Arcadia Classics\" menu section, the Egg Strata Cobbler read like a mashup of things I loved but never thought to put together.  Oven roasted veggies, cheddar cheese, sausage and creme fraiche (insert your own South Park joke here).  I had expected this to come on a plate, but instead its stacked high in a bowl with copious amounts of that creme fraiche.  Its comfort food to be sure, but probably one of the classier comfort food dishes I've had.  And fortunately it was also ridiculously delicious.  They didn't skimp on the cheese and there were plenty of nice chunks of sausage mixed in with the veggies.

Total cost for the food, OJ, tax and tip came to about $28.  The atmosphere felt alot like Cafe Monarch to me, but fortunately the prices did not.  My waitress was a super sweet lady (didn't catch her name) and the entire meal was phenomenal.  The crowds were definitely swelling as the morning went on, so my advice would be to get here at or near opening as I did.  Parking is also a little bit tricky if you can't grab one of the street spots.  I'd park at Panera Bread a few blocks east of here and walk over if you can't get a street spot.  Founder Carolyn Ellis can beam with pride over Arcadia Farms which she created in 1990 as just a simple take out bakery.  Today its a robust destination for breakfast, lunch, baked goods, and elaborate receptions.  And really any place that evokes memories of Cafe Monarch for me is a winner in my book."}
{"text":"This place is dangerous to my figure.  I guess I didn't care about it too much today.  I got so many wonderful baked goods.  They baked them right there, so it is fresh and you can taste it.  The blueberry lemon muffin was delicious.  I also got a strawberry lemon brioche, which was wonderful.  I am saving the lemon cake cookie for the twins.  I hope it is still available after their nap.  I didn't get a sandwich but I am sure coming back to check them out for lunch."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times.  lovely atmosphere great healthy food always.  A snooty staff but it's Scottsdale it's a part of it
I walked in today on a chilly day by myself.  Waite patiently for 15 minutes with only 5 parties ahead of me.  Politely told them 1 please. The harried hostess said you will have to sit outside.  I said no I'm sorry it's too cold today.  and she said sorry I have too many reservations.  I said then any reason you don't have a \"reservations only sign\"on your long Check in line? She said excuse me?

I left

The reason was simple. She was taking any walk in that would make her money. But not a table that she perceived would not. She was literally calculating dollars sense and time and throwing out customers real time  to maximize profit to table.  

Her prerogative..  Mine to never eat their again and make sure as many folks as possible realize this sleazy place treats their customers as nothing but a financial equation 

Highly HIGHLY not recommended. Though the food and atmosphere are tremendous. The management and ownership are abhorrent and deserve to fail"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite lunch time spots. The feminine decor really lends itself  as the perfect destination for a lunch with your girlfriends, but the food is substantial enough to impress any guy. Started with the Crab and Avacado tower appetizer, it was divine. I had the Pesto shrimp salad and my guest had the goat cheese and mushroom tart. Both were prepared perfectly. Loved the fact that they left a nice sized decantur of iced tea on the table for self service. It was less intrusive and ensured my glass was always full. Great experience."}
{"text":"I always come here for breakfast and sit outside and I really enjoy it. The black bean omelet is my favorite. The breakfast sandwich is also very good. The place is really cute out on the back outside patio. It feels like you're in someones home while you're dining but it's always a good spot to grab food. It does take some time for the food to come out so if you're in a rush I wouldn't suggest it."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and encountered maybe the worst management I have ever experienced. My wife and I were told to expect a 25 minute wait with only a single three person party ahead of us and dozens of empty tables around. We decided to wait and then watched as tables were cleared and no one who was waiting got seated. 

After a half hour, I approached the desk and asked how much longer it would be. Another couple after us had done the same and then left, leading me to assume that things weren't looking good. I was told that we would have to wait until after lunch which was another 20 minutes. I said this was unacceptable as we had been told 25 minutes and it had now already been 30. The woman who had put our name on the list then said that whoever put us on the list had made a mistake... What?

Apparently they were expecting lots of reservations around noon. All of the  photos of empty tables I included here were taken at 12:30. Those tables were empty when we arrived at 11:00. That is 90 minutes with well over half of the tables in the restaurant sitting empty and no one being seated. The hostess grudgingly told me that she would seat us, but only if we ordered breakfast quickly before they switched to their lunch menu. Great, now their incompetence and negligence to inform us that we would miss breakfast upfront had become our problem. No apology was offered at any point by anyone involved.

Soon after we were seated our waitress came over and prodded us to hurry up and order breakfast. We ordered quickly. A little while later an employee walked up to our table and asked if we were waiting for food. She then asked what we had ordered. At this point I began to feel like I was on Candid Camera. I half expected a TV host to jump out from behind a bush holding a microphone telling me that this was all just an elaborate prank. 

Fortunately they had not forgotten our order and our meal was served soon after. I was hoping the food would be good enough to make up for the terrible service, but it was not. The smoked salmon completely lacked flavor and the bread it was served on was nearly stale. The salad with my dish was bland. The only good thing about the breakfast was the fresh squeezed orange juice. 

For her part, my wife did enjoy her meal. The jam was good, the eggs were cooked properly, and the bacon was sufficiently crispy, just the way she likes it. But she agreed that it wasn't as good as The Snooze or Butter's/Butterfield's. 

The patio is very nice, and the courtyard looks cozy too. We were seated in a small room where the tables felt a little to close together.

We will definitely not be coming back here again. If you decide to eat here, make a reservation and request the patio."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times over the past 15 years and it was always top notch. Yesterday our food just wasn't up to par. The chicken in the cobb salad was tough and dry as if it had been refrigerated too long. The bleu cheese vinaigrette salad dressing was very bland but way too vinegary (and I usually love vinaigrettes). We asked for a creamy dressing such as Ranch to help with the acidic taste. The have no creamy dressings, and brought us feta vinaigrette to try which was even more acidic. Because I have loved Arcadia Farms so much for so long, I will give it another try.   Fingers crossed."}
{"text":"5 stars just for being such a beautiful place. A great restaurant not only serves great food but transports you to a new place. Arcadia does just that. A little slice of France in the middle of the desert. Quaint cafe located in Scottsdale. Deliciously fresh! I had the wild mushroom and chives omelette. Large portions and no issue substituting potatoes for veggies. Try a glass of The Classic...interesting fresh lemony twist to your usual brunch mimosa staple. Friendly attentive staff (Lisa was a sweet and an amazing server) and relaxing airy ambiance. Took me back to Paris for just a moment."}
{"text":"Went here for a weekend lunch, made reservations the day before...reservations are probably a good idea as there are always people waiting outside it seems like. We sat in the back garden area...bring your sunglasses or you will melt. But the area in the back so pleasant, that it's one of the few times that I prefer outside to inside. There is a lot of shade in the back, so dont worry about the heat too much. 

Make sure you bring your people watching sunglasses, because the people are important looking people...like VH1 housewives and grandmas who own Fortune 500 companies. It's a pretty posh crowd to say the least. But I enjoyed it. It's always nice to be in a civilized restaurant where service and food is great. I mean, i'm pretty sure you'll get served no matter what you wear, but it can't hurt to throw on a pair of khakis and a polo when you decide to come here.

I had the grilled vegetable chicken quesadilla....and it's the best quesadilla i've had. And the bread that comes out when you sit down is also amazing, I pretty much had two loaves before the entree came out. Our waitress had a British accent so obviously i had to ask her to repeat everything twice. But she was super nice and gave us really good service. Definitely a repeat location."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch and totally enjoyed every morsel. White and red sangria and mimosa were very good. Crab cakes, salad, sandwiches, and soups were very good. The atmosphere of the patios and umbrellas was so pleasant."}
{"text":"Cute and quaint brunch and lunch location.  It looks smaller than it actually is because the place gets packed out the wazoo.  Outdoor seating is optimal if the weather is pleasant.  

The apricot iced tea was brewed just right without any additional sweeteners.  And our server brought us carafes so we could refill whenever we wanted.  The brie appetizer was sinful!  

I got the veggie quesadilla which was stuffed to bursting and toasted to perfection.  My friends ordered greek and shrimp salads, chicken pesto sandwich, and the salmon.  No complaints all around."}
{"text":"We had a small Christmas luncheon here and everything was perfect. We had a reservation and were seated promptly. Our server was pleasant and efficient. We started with a cheese plate, 3 of us had their tea of the day which was peach infused. It was delicious and light in flavor. Our meals consisted of a ham and and cheese sandwich, a tuna salad sandwich, an herb roasted chicken sandwich and a mushroom, spinach, goat cheese tart. The sandwiches were all served with potato salad. Everything was homemade, fresh and delicious. We all opted to take dessert to go, which was equally fresh and delicious. We had carrot cake, lemon cookies, and an oatmeal cookie. Will definitely return and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Don't take me wrong; I would like to give more stars - the place is charming, the service is professional and the menu creative. However, I found my strata cobbler (\"best thing on the menu\" according to the server) too heavy on cheese and too light on eggs. Same with the crepes - too much cheese feeling. Conclusion: if you like cheese, creme fresh, real whipped creme (all of which were also served in plenty quantities) don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"I just love this place.  Its friendly and comfortable.  The food is delicious.  
The lemon cake cookies are amazing.
Yesterday I took an old friend, who was in town for a conference.  I had not seen
her in over 20 yrs, so wanted a place we could talk.  We sat there for almost 3 hrs.
Its summer and it was not busy at that time.  We left a really good tip.
I have 2 favorite places in Phoenix, this is number one.  I drive 2 hrs to go there."}
{"text":"We just had a delicious lunch at Arcadia Farms.  We both enjoyed the Salmon Super Salad...which was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast & lunch cafe with large menu and outside seating.  Lunch today was the best. Baked goat cheese dip with tomatoes, onions, olives as a tarter was a big winner.  Mushroom and chicken crepes and the mushroom, spinach, goat cheese tart entree's were all delicious.  Elegant."}
{"text":"This morning was my first time at Arcadia Farms. 
The Good:
Julia, our server was super sweet.  We got to sit out on the back patio which was full of umbrellas so there was plenty of shade on a beautiful day.  I ordered the French Toast that came with chicken apple sausage, it was decent, but cold as you will see why as you continue reading. 
The Not So Good:
One of the gals in our party ordered a veggie sandwich off the lunch menu and it was explained to us that she would get her meal a few minutes after the rest of us who ordered breakfast.  I guess if we wanted breakfast we had to order before 11 and after that is when the lunch menu kicks in. So we all gave our order just at 11.  We all received our meals and since the gal who ordered a veggie sandwich was going to get hers a few minutes later, I waited to start eating until she got hers. Well, 10 min went by and nothing, was told it should be any second. 30 minutes went by and she still had not received her VEGGIE sandwich.  I started eating my cold food which I guess is my fault that I waited for the other gal to get her VEGGIE sandwich, was just trying to be polite.  I saw plenty of other people who sat down after 11:00 that got their sandwiches. An hour and 10 minutes went by ....no VEGGIE sandwich.  We called Julia over and told her to cancel the veggie sandwich.  Either the manager overheard it or Julia had told him what was going on cause he finally came by and said he was sorry and that it was coming out.  The gal who ordered it said she didn't want to wait for it. The manager said he would take care of it and get it for her to go.  In addition to this, one of the omelets that came to the table had a long black hair cooked into it.  She sent it back, of course and she got another one.  The manager did not come to the table and talk about the hair omelet and nothing was done with her bill.
The Good (cont.):
Julia, again, was very sweet and apologetic about the sandwich not coming out.  We kept telling her it was not her fault cause she's not in the kitchen making the food.  She did offer some bread and butter to our foodless friend but she said no thanks. Julia  did bring some \"peace offering\" scones so she had something to eat. That was very nice of her to do that.  She also was nice enough to do separate checks for 6 of us. 

I'm not sure if I will go back.  I really don't know why a veggie sandwich took an hour and 15 minutes. Nothing was grilled or cooked on this. Should not have taken that long.  The hair in the omelet, it happens but it should have been discovered before it got to the table, the hair was smack in the middle on top of the omelet. 
If I decide to give them a second try, I do hope Julia is my server. 

I'd give 5 stars to Julia and the atmosphere. 1 star for the food and experience."}
{"text":"With 8 empty tables, we were denied seating. Perhaps because we had a stroller and they advertise as not being kid friendly. 

Disappointed as we like to try local gems."}
{"text":"This was a very nice place to take your mother.  We both had a good lunch.  The service and iced tea were very good.  I felt like the food was high quality, but maby should have been priced 1 or 2 dollars less.  The patio was beautiful and very peaceful to visit with your lunch partner aka Mom."}
{"text":"I debated whether to give 4 or 5 stars to this place. I'd give it 5 as a nice place to go for Ladies that Lunch and a 5 as a memorable place to take an elderly (woman) friend or relative for an outing. It's a 4 for a date because the estrogen level is so high.

The only couple I saw was an older man with a woman that looked like she might be his mother or an aunt. There was no music that I noticed which is nice for older people that might have trouble hearing or concentrating when they're out and about in town.

There are several beautiful patio areas in the front and back. The decor is very tasteful and upscale but not stuffy. The food was very good. One of the things I noticed was the strawberries on the salad were flavorful, not like a lot of strawberries, merely hinting at the flavor of the fruit. The baguette used for my sandwich was high quality with a nice consistency. I hesitated to order a sandwich thinking I'd get a generic type French bread. The salad had the perfect amount of dressing, evenly distributed with some lovely toasted almonds. 

There might be a different crowd here for brunch, but again, I see it more as an older lady place than for couples or younger people. Well-worth a visit though, followed by a breeze through at the Marketplace next door. If I was to go again, I'd probably have lunch at the Cafe and dessert at the Market for a slight change of scenery.

When you pay your bill, they give you a 10% coupon for the Marketplace. You can use the coupon for food or coffee as well as gifts next door."}
{"text":"This place is very Cute. I was able to have a delightful brunch here. Based on the reviews I somewhat expected more. The food is a solid 2.5 -3, but the place is cute and homey and I guess that is what makes it so quaint.  My friend told me there are plenty of baby showers and bridal showers and I can see why. It's like being in a small cottage- eating with friends.  The waitress that day was not so attentive and we had to flag her down a couple of times.  My warm chicken salad was Blah.. but my friend's  Crepe , from what I remembered was Very Tastey.. The desserts were cute, but nothing extraordinary.. overall the place is for the ambiance and for company with friends, on a  brunch out ting.. but if you are to do a real brunch I say head to the Hotel Brunches for all you can eat.. a little more on the price, but alot more appetizing.. especially if you are on vacation!"}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms is feminine and cozy. It's light and breezy and shabby chic. The food doesn't disappoint, either, in taste or presentation. Take your mothers, daughters, aunts, nieces, or girlfriends and enjoy this gorgeous January sun out in the garden."}
{"text":"Such a cute place. Went with my dad for lunch and the service was great, the food was decent and the desert was out of this world! Good place for a meal with parents, date or something where classy and tidy are desired."}
{"text":"Outstanding farm-to-table seasonal food served in what looks and feels like a French cottage near the gallery district of Scottsdale.  There is ample outdoor seating when the weather is nice (as it is most of the time there) and a charming inside dining area.  While the food is well crafted and delicious, this does not seem to be the kind of place that gets many male patrons.  I could count on one hand how many men were dining here when I went for lunch.  To compound the matter, I had just finished a difficult and sweaty hike up Camelback Mountain prior to coming here.  My shabby appearance earned me loads of disdain from the hostess.  But, as my friend duly noted, \"our money is still good.\"  Indeed.

I started with the soup, a split pea and ham served with a cheesy breadstick, was an excellent rendition of this classic.  It had a smokiness that only a good hamhock can lend.  My entree choice was the herb roasted chicken sandwich, which was a delicious combination of slow-roasted chicken, oven-cured tomatoes, roasted artichokes, baby spinach and herb goat cheese spread on a warm baguette served with a bacon-spiked potato salad.  As good as this was, by friend's meal was even better.  She ordered the chicken, wild mushroom, goat cheese and leek crepes with a basil cream sauce.  I took a bite and it was literally a flavor explosion.  I almost regretted my menu choice after tasting her's.

Arcadia Farms Cafe also specializes in baked goods, including various pastries, cakes, muffins and cookies.  We grabbed a few cookies (chocolate toffee and an iced lemon) to go.  

I would definitely return, particularly to try breakfast (which is supposed to be quite good).  Next time, though, I will be sure to not engage in strenuous exercise right before."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to get breakfast on Veterans Day after a five mile birthday run that my lady made us do, fear not, I won, and I also won in the Yelping.  We arrived in time, the last hour of breakfast.  

What I did not know was how popular the destination was for breakfast and lunch which had reserved most outdoor tables, fear not, we were sat within a minute of arrival. (Can we get this on openTable?)  I ordered the breakfast quesadilla, and she the two eggs and bacon (so basic, no curiosity I say!), a plain croissant (we were too tardy for the pain au chocolate).  I would then ask for the jam and it would be delivered, it went elegantly with the croissant.

Just as I finished the buttered masterpiece we were given two small strawberry scones that needed to multiply in palette, so delicious, but our food arrived hot.

The quesadilla had complex flavor...but, I do have a question, was the guacamole house made, because it did not appear that way.  Irregard to that fact it was awesome.

My coffee was always full, probably a bit too much, but I'll take a full hot coffee from none at all.  Cheers to the waitress!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat in the Scottsdale area if you are looking for healthy food.  We had lunch one day and breakfast another.  Both the service and the food was top quality.  We had one meal in the little kitchen area where mostly sandwiches and drinks are served and another meal in the nicer patio area.  Both were crowded which indicted the popularity of the the establishment.   Great place with great food.  Will be back when returning the Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Definitely for the ladies!! sorry guys...but on occassion you will see a poor bloke dragged along by his other half!!
I probably frequent Arcadia Farms once a quarter and I have never had a bad meal - while the service can be inconsistent - Im ok in building my anticipation for the meal!! ....and the reward  is a blessing.
The back patio (in fair weather) is my favorite spot with the sun playing peek-a-boo.
I think that I have tried every salad on their menu - my fav being the strawberry chicken salad...but you have got to try the Wild Mushroom, Spinach & Goat Cheese Tart (....salivating now)
 A great place to catch up with the girls =0)"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. Excellent, fresh, flavorful, healthy food. Great service. This is one the best breakfast/lunch places in the valley."}
{"text":"Literally, the most delicious food ever, & the comforting, cottage style ambiance tops it off! 

I definitely suggest trying the bree appetizer, & the Cobb salad is a perfect choice for any hungry tummy!"}
{"text":"Hmmm. Was just reading the bad reviews but what can I say, I love this place!  I have been coming here for lunch since I moved to Arizona from California 13 years ago and they still have my favorite salad, sandwiches and the glazed lemon cookie!!!  Arcadia Farms has the best Arnold Palmer and I always order this when I am here.  I like the ambiance, cute little place to have a nice lunch with your girlfriends and just sit down and enjoy the outdoor sitting (except for the occasional birds that come flying close by)!  But heck, the birds are part of what this place is all about, just make sure not to feed them anything please!  Service is pretty good and the servers do pay attention to you, even when you're sitting solo (my friend was late and so I was sitting by myself waiting).  There was the issue of breakfast and lunch but our server was very helpful and gracious about it.  I think what I love about this place is that it reminds me of where women gather to meet their friends and just sit down and have a good chatty time..."}
{"text":"Have you guys ever watched Ina Garten? And thought \"I really need everything she's about but in a restaurant!\" Then welcome to Arcadia Farms. This is the cutest little cottage type atmosphere and the courtyard is just to die for. I came here for brunch a few weeks ago and could not get over the atmosphere. Parking is a bit hectic, but no worries the weather was nice enough to walk down the street. We were quickly seated in the shaded courtyard outside, and promptly ordered our mimosas ( as one should for brunch!) then I ordered a quiche. The quiche was delicious and had leeks and goat cheese. Service was so fast I couldn't believe it, and after looking around I noticed so many girls were there celebrating engagements and babies! This is clearly a great place to meet up! 

After the check came, we popped in next door to the bakery and it was absolutely adorable. I will definitely be back to try one of their gigantic coconut cupcakes!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Stopped in here on my way to the airport to grab some food for the planeride home. Picked up the organic farmer's salad and a slice of iced lemon poppy poundcake. The salad was delicious! Super fresh with really tasty goat cheese and a great light dressing. Was just what I needed when the flight attendant's started coming by with the food cart. Really great service from a guy at the counter who also gave me a few recommendations on what to check out while in town."}
{"text":"I'm listening to 2 Live Crew as I'm writing this so I'm feeling extraordinarily misogynistic. Forgive a brotha. 

There are two things you should know about this place, and it pretty much sums up my entire existence... 

Take a girl here on a lunch date. She will see you as sensitive and intuitive. You may want to use phrases like \"I feel...\" and \"When Carrie gave her assistant that Louis Vuitton...\"

Order the Mushroom tart. Or is it tort? 

If you follow my advice, gentlemen, you'll have a great day. Good luck. And god speed."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! If I lived in Arizona I would come here every weekend! Such an adorable place with very fresh food and an adorable, relaxing vibe.

Came here with my mom and sister on a girls trip, and we loved it so much we came back twice during our stay. The outdoor seating is so lovely- it is as if you are relaxing in a beautiful garden.

The food was delicious as well--the bakery items including the scones are a true standout and the eggs were also very good.

Service was friendly and attentive and the restrooms inside were very clean as well--highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms Cafe is a great weekend brunch place that is perfect for a relaxing, lazy day. I arrived at 11:30 am, a little too early for lunch, which starts at noon. As an appetizer I ordered the wild mushroom and chive omelet with goat cheese ($12). By the time I finished, lunch serviced started. Everything on the menu looked delicious, making the decision tough. I went with the Grilled Chicken and Vegetable Quesadilla ($13) and Turkey & Brie Sandwich with Arcadia potato salad ($14). All of the dishes were flavorful while not being overly rich. I also appreciate that their menu identified which items were vegan, vegetarian, diary free and/or gluten free. I will definitely be back to try their crepes and salads. 

What I recommend:
-- Wild mushroom and chive omelet with goat cheese
-- Turkey & brie sandwich
-- Grilled chicken and vegetable quesadilla
-- Arcadia potato salad or field greens as the side"}
{"text":"We went for brunch. My friend has a nut allergy, and told our server this. When her meal came out, she was in the middle of eating it and noticed a nut on her plate. They said that the kitchen accidentally dropped an almond into her food. This was obviously unacceptable. They were not apologetic. They did not comp our meal. Be warned if you have an allergy - they run a careless kitchen. Would never return here."}
{"text":"I love coming here. I love the layout. It's very friendly staff is always helpful. I don't have anything bad to say. If your vegan or gluten  free or health freak you love it here. I'm a die hard goat cheese lover and they do amazing dishes. Perfect place for birthdays/brunch/baby shower/ a date for wife or girlfriend. Lastly because I have nothing bad to and read some reviews, it's not overrated or over priced, if you have questions anyone of the staff will help, and it's peaceful and not loud and over crowed like Scottsdale road in old town.  They refill your drinks on hot days too."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and this was the first place I wanted to eat for lunch. Not only Farm to Table with organic salads for me, but also a wide variety of sandwiches and entrees for hubby. He ordered the hot ham sandwich with melted mozzarella, red onion chutney, mustard aioli on rosemary baguette. Loved it, and side of potato salad too...polished off both of them even though he's not a big eater at lunchtime. I ordered the Cobb Salad which perfectly fits my Keto plan without substitutions. Chicken, Bacon, Avocado, Bleu Cheese crumbles, on greens with bleu cheese vinaigrette.  The vinaigrette was far too tangy for the salad so I supplemented with plain evoo. And the salad was not bad, but there was nothing wow about it.  I would recommend something else because this menu is amazing and all the food on tables around us looked fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, it was so hidden that it took forever to find. Once your there it is such a cute place for brunch. It looks classy and upscale, but also traditional. 

Their pastries were delicious but they didn't have good coffee which is confusing because you usually those come as a pair. 

My food was delicious, I got the pulled pork hash. I wish I would have had my eggs sunny side up instead of scrambled but wasn't given the option. Also, the pork was a little dry. All in all, it was still good though. 

The service was good too!! Free scones!"}
{"text":"I just love this place!! 
We decided to escape the cold Chicago weather for a weekend in Phoenix, the sun was shining, weather was great! 
Arcadia Farms was a recommendation from our concierge at The Royal Palms. We had lunch in the back garden at Arcadia Farms. 
It was just lovely!! Everything about it! 
The service was so friendly, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was so peaceful! 
All of the food tasted so fresh, so good...I think our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, Everything on the menu looked so good...we wanted to experience it all! 
We started with the Crab and Avocado Tower and Savory Smoked Salmon Cheesecake - both were so delicious! The servings were large...we had to leave some left on the plates :-( 
Then we shared the wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart, so good! 
We had dessert, fresh berries. 
Just Lovely!!"}
{"text":"My posture straightened and my speech was clearer as we were seated at an outdoor table, just my mother and I. We were given cute little pastries to begin. They were delectable and paired wonderfully with my hot coffee. Our meals were very tasty and the service was excellent. The marketplace next door is cozy and filled with cook books and gifts for those who enjoy spending time on delicate food found at the farmer's market on a Saturday morning. I found myself wanting everything. I bet I could be Julia Child...or maybe a fancy picnic-er...or a fabulous host...or even a gracious gift giver!

Needless to say, I will be back. This is a great spot for a baby shower, a brunch with mom, a lunch with the ladies, or just a cup-of-coffee-with-a-pastry kind of morning."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch last Friday and were pleased with our experience.  The decor is cozy-shabby-chic and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed.  The front patio was dog friendly too.  Food was pretty good.  We started with complementary warm strawberry scones which were delicious!  My husband had the breakfast quesadilla which was good, but my mushroom, spinach and leek tart was just OK -- it was filled with goat cheese (which the menu did not list as an ingredient) and I didn't care for.  The spinach and leeks were a bit slimy too.  Overall, we were pleased and we would definitely try it again, but would make different menu choices."}
{"text":"Relaxed beautiful environment that seamlessly blends indoor/outdoor dining.
Their marketplace is next door and offers much of the same foods as the cafe. My wife had the gazpacho as an entree and loved it. I went with the Greek salad with chicken. Everything was freshly prepared. A little pricey but was well worth it."}
{"text":"The 3 of us came here on a late Saturday morning for breakfast. We were seated within minutes of arriving. The waitress was really attentive to our needs. Now onto the important part, the FOOD! I ordered the egg strata cobbler and their granola parfait to share with my daughter. Boy did I over order. The egg strata was just as described. The sausage was plentiful, with just enough cheese and it came out piping hot! The granola parfait was nice, a good way to balance the savoriness of the egg strata. I also tried a bite of my sister's strawberry and creme scone that she ordered, one of the best I've ever had. The one thing I wish was that they would offer an Afternoon Tea service. It definitely has the perfect ambiance for it and their regular food and baked goodies are already scrumptious!"}
{"text":"This place is a quaint spot in the old part of dt scottsdale we were going to try daily dose but they were packed so we scooted down the street .we have been here a while ago for lunch ,service was good and very friendly. i ordered the wild mushroom goat cheese chive  omlet i guess i should have inquired what mushrooms were used because all that they used were criminis and a small smathering of goat cheese and chives and a little under seasoned for my taste,my wife had the quesadilla which i had a bite of it was good"}
{"text":"Food: 4
Decor: 4.5
Ambiance: 5
Service: 4.5
Value: 3

Entree salads were very good tasting, and patio was nice. Price was a bit expensive overall for the experience, though."}
{"text":"Came to Arcadia Farms Cafe for brunch on a Saturday but there was no brunch menu.  Besides this, the food here is pretty delicious.  I enjoyed the chicken mushroom crepes in a cream sauce.  These were indescribable but it was a great creation and excellent prepared dish!  My friend had ordered one of the chicken sandwiches and said it was out of this world.  

After living in Phoenix, I had no idea this place existed.  It is a cute smaller restaurant, tucked on the side of the street in Scottsdale.  Have not tried the brunch or dinner yet  but plan to in the coming months."}
{"text":"I got married at the PAM cafe this weekend (ceremony on the patio, reception inside the cafe) and it was great. There were some communication issues in the planning stages but the event itself went off without a hitch. The dinner was delicious, the cupcakes rocked, the staff was great! 

YAY Arcadia Farms! 

If you're thinking of having your wedding here and want to know more details about the event, feel free to message me. My brain is too fried at the moment to include it all in the review."}
{"text":"Omg...so glad I tried this place. It is sooo fancy and cute, white tablecloths and the decorations are on point. The food here is amazing. I love love love it. To me, it is a best breakfast place in Scottsdale so far. Everything is so tasty. We had pulled pork hash, smoked salmon baguette and some pastry. Five stars for everything. The price is reasonable and the portions are adequate. I definitely recommend this place and can't wait to be back here."}
{"text":"Special place!  Tasty food, yummy desserts!  Delicious breads...

The atmosphere is so lovely and pretty.

There was a baby shower taking place while we were there, but they had their own space and it didn't intrude at all.

Five stars"}
{"text":"I hesitantly walked into this beautiful cafe with my 2-year-old daughter, wondering if kids were welcome in such a gorgeous, refined setting. Well, the perfectly groomed hostesses and server made us feel more than welcome, giving my daughter and me special treatment the whole time we were there. And the food was delicious!!!!! So, so good. I recommend sitting on the beautiful patio even if it's hot because the misters help and it's too cute not to sit there and enjoy."}
{"text":"Just had brunch there.  I must say the place has appeal cause it is cute, looks clean with white-washed walls, white table linens, etc.  It draws a good sized crowd.  It has an open airy feeling with the large patio seating area in back and front patio.  There is ample space for many tables so it does not feel crowded.  There are multiple staff and I was served by no less than 5-6 people, (so much for continuity).  They were pleasant enough, but looked a bit overworked and under paid, (you know the type).  I'd like to give the place 3 stars, but  I couldn't go that far since that means \"A-OK\", which this place is not.

My food was done on the cheap.  My fruit plate $7.00 consisted of a couple large sliced strawberries, two really very tiny grapes, and a few hunks of mellon (the inexpensive ones).  Yes, everything is cut in large hunks -- a labor saving technique, (not because it is chic).  The omelet I ordered was supposed to be wild mushroom and chives $12.  What actually arrived was an overcooked and dry omelet with a daab of cream cheese in the center and a few bits of mushroom and chives around the edges. Upon first glance it looked like it contained mushrooms (not really wild, eh?), and chives, but upon opening the omelet these only appeared around the edges.  Such trickery !!!  There was also a serving of home fries, again cut in large hunks.  I'm sure this restaurant serves a need for some but I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This quaint little spot offers great food and a pleasant atmosphere.  We started with the baked brie which was quite good.  I had the warm ham sandwich and split pea soup.  The Sandwich was flavorful, slightly spicy thanks to the deli mustard, and the bread was very fresh tasting."}
{"text":"Very pleasant place. Nice menu. Good service, although a little slow at lunch, even at 2 PM. It was my first time there. I had a cobb salad, which was very good. I'll go back, as much for the breezy, comfortable openness of the place as for the food."}
{"text":"First time here Awesome food.   Great ambiance.  I had the breakfast quesadilla and my wife had the crepes.  No crumbs left.  Pastries were melt in you mouth savory. Our huge party was provided great service.  We will be coming back"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delightful! Had the chicken and mushroom crepes- great portion size and the sauce on them was delightful. We were celebrating my mom's birthday, so they gave us a small coconut cake to celebrate. Honestly, one of the best cakes I've ever had. A must try! Only complaint was about the poor service. Our server seemed very disinterested, spilled water on me, and made us wait a long time to order and to pay the check."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast.  I think the company is missing the mark by not serving espresso, cappuccinos or mochas. One, this is a huge mark up with great margins!  Two, clients don't want to walk next door.  I give it 4/5 due to the food being so good (farm to table) and the atmosphere.  The service can be hit or miss.  There is one older woman who just moved to AZ who I think is wonderful, but others didn't have much personality."}
{"text":"The croissants were amazing!
Food was good, and I liked the choice of Mimosa flavors."}
{"text":"Overrated.  Service was VERY slow.  Atmosphere  felt amazing however the air of snootiness overcame the serenity and it became a very disappointing experience.  It felt like we crashed a Red Hat tea party, big YAWN !    The salad was fine but believe me you were paying TOP dollar for some lettuce.  If you are over 55 and looking to lunch with the ladies this is a perfect spot, otherwise many other places would be a better choice."}
{"text":"i want to live in this restaurant.

i posted on gogobot, \"Heading to Phoenix for a wedding next weekend - what MUST I eat??\" and got a ton of great responses - and Arcadia Farms was definitely among more than one recommendation. yay for gogobot, the greatest trip planning site, ever. (shameless plug, i digress...) let's move on.

it is the cutest place. very napa-esque. each room is decorated differently, in a shabby chic sort of way. then there's a courtyard full of linen umbrellas and misters, and another room out back, like a sunroom. already, i died on the walk in.

we ordered some mimosas to start as we peruse the menu, unable to choose dishes...and snacked on some strawberry scones while we decided. the menu boasts a wide range for brunch, omelettes, crepes, croque-monsieurs...what to choose!

our server was extremely helpful, saying the cobbler was her favorite...good, that's what i was thinking.

so we ordered cobblers and quesadillas, mimosas and muffins. and everyone was delighted and it was a fabulous start to a fabulous saturday.

ingredients were super fresh, portion sizes were perfect, everything was exactly what brunch should be.

okay i'm obsessed. and then i got home and checked the website and i'm even more obsessed! the site is clean and pretty with recipes and the same layout as this blog. coincidence? soul mates? i think so."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms is AWESOME. A friend of mine that lives in Scottsdale recommended it to me as a great brunch spot. My mom, brother and I went for brunch on a Saturday and were seated outside right away. We got there 10 minutes before they switched to lunch service, but let us order off of either the breakfast or lunch menus. The red Sangria was great and was served in a pitcher with big wine glasses full of ice and fruit, to serve ourselves.

Our waiter was so attentive, and cute to boot! I think his name was John, and he looked like a combo of Johnny Depp/Colin Ferrell. We needed to get a last minute birthday cake for my grandmother's 70th, and asked John if he had a bakery recommendation. Coincidentally, they have a bakery right across the street and had made one extra tuxedo cake! John put the cake on our bill and brought it right over when we finished our meal. 

We ordered the berry crepe and the breakfast quesadilla. Both were amazing. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and the cookies and cake across the street."}
{"text":"How is it possible to feel like you're actually eating at a farm house when you're really in the middle of Phoenix?! I have no idea, but Arcadia Farms does it. The restaurant is completely adorable with a couple of different buildings, the main one having segmented rooms just like a house. The chairs and table are all mismatched in a charming way and I almost expect to see my grandmother come from around a corner wearing an apron and a light dusting of flour.

Gabi and I had lunch here on my last day in town and we requested a table in the back room in hopes that it would be a tad bit less noisy. And even though we were there for a meeting and pulled out our laptops to work for a bit our server never batted an eye and she took excellent care of us.

I ordered the chicken and warm veggies salad and added avocado, a trick that Gabi shared with me. It was pretty much a chop salad, which I actually really like. What is it about places that give you gargantuan pieces of lettuce in a salad? I mean I know it may seem like I have a big mouth, but there's no way I'm fitting that in gracefully. I also ordered the iced tea, which I highly, highly recommend. It tasted like it's brewed with fruit and it's oh-so-delicious!"}
{"text":"This review is not about the food, as we have YET to taste it. This is solely on the service/speed and accuracy of the orders. We have waited now 40 minutes for our food, and have watched everyone around us get theirs first- including many that arrived after our table of 3. Drinks came out one at a time, and we had to remind the waitress of what we all ordered - mimosas, water and coffee.

Update- food just arrived luke warm, so that tells me it was sitting somewhere just waiting??

Really shocked that a 4 star rated restaurant is really THIS bad!!"}
{"text":"A fine place, with a charming and enjoyable ambience and outdoors seating, but my meal last week was middle of the road. My wife liked it more than I did. I ordered crab avocado stack and a side of potatoes. No problems, nice to know it's focused on local food where possible (...though not the crab). I could see that I might have ordered poorly and their baked goods look stellar, so I'm giving four stars because the location is awesome and their store next door, the Marketplace, is very cool. 

And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that my wife and I were treated exceptionally well the previous day at the Marketplace. My wife had a dietary constraint so the kitchen made us a special salad right as they were closing just to be 100% sure that there wasn't anything potentially problematic dietarily in my wife's salad. And I got a great latte.

All in all I'd give Arcadia Farms another try to be sure and would have no problem heading back to the Marketplace as well."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food and ambiance. My wife and i love having breakfast here pastries are amazing as well.  Dine here with confidence."}
{"text":"Have dined here occasionally over the years, and food has been consistently good.  You can visit the Cafe separately from the museum, but it's a great stop when spending time at the exhibitions. Lunch is served till mid-afternoon, then desserts/coffee till closing (usually close when the museum does at 5pm; sometimes close early).  The vegetable quesadilla is my personal favorite (can get chicken or shrimp added), with lemonade.  Their coffee is very good and while usually no room for dessert, brought one home last visit and it was delicious.  Atmosphere is both nice and casual; service prompt 99% of the time, and staff is pleasant.  If not so far away, would visit more often."}
{"text":"First off.... the food was AMAZING. Our friendly sever, Derek (I think) , made sure we had plenty of water at all times since we were sitting outside in the heat! The food didn't take very long to arrive and it was fantastic! Loved the atmosphere and how friendly everyone was!"}
{"text":"First time at Arcadia farms cafe, we came here to celebrate my grandmas 84th birthday :) service was great, the host was amazing making sure our experience was perfect placing us towards the back in a quieter location. 

The food was amazing I got the crepes which had a great taste! I am allergic to all nuts and this is the first restaurant I have been to where they made a pesto nut free! My mother got the goat cheese tart and that was to die for! So yummy! 

Over all this place is well worth trying out, the atmosphere was clean and very rustic cute! Nice patio area for winter time! 

Thank you for a great experience we will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for my last day brunch before coming back to Miami and it's a cute spot. Very very quiet and classy. The hostess was quick to attend to us, the waiter was really nice. We had the vanilla grapefruit tea which I highly recommend!!! Amazing!!! The breakfast was fresh and everything was good. The waiter even went out of his way to bring us some bakery sweets. 
I recommend the place and I will try it again but I'm going to try the Sunday brunch to see if the crowd is different. Lots of older people so I felt restrained from being my usual talkative self. But I will be back!"}
{"text":"Cutest spot I've been to for brunch! We ate the black bean omelette and the Crepe. The Omelette was really good, but the crepe I felt had too much going on. I'll def be back to try other stuff in the menu. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious lunch food, great patio, with only a couple hang-ups. I ventured here on Sunday for brunch with my mom and Erin S. Good thing we made reservations because the place was bumpin. We were seated on the expansive back patio filled with many tables. There was a wedding luncheon in action as well as what looked like a bridal shower. The private dining area in the back appeared very well suited for such affairs.

I ordered the salmon salad, which came on a bed of all kinds of leafy goodness. The dressing was very tasty and the salmon was cooked so tender and flaky that a spoon could cut right through. Erin ordered the popular Strawberry Chicken Salad, with mixed baby greens, toasted almonds and poppyseed vinaigrette. All the ingredients were fresh, and often gluten free with vegan options. For dessert we had the Seasonal Fresh Fruit Crisp, which was ok - think \"apple crisp.\" Now, the Tuxedo Cake was exquisite. The breading was moist and meshed with the adjoining caramel and frosting. I highly recommend it.

The only downsides were that we never received our appetizer, and our waitress disappeared after we acquired our entrees. We hoped to order dessert and were curious about our missing plate. After hailing down another waiter, we realized that ours was occupied by the large wedding party. No big deal, we were enjoying our experience, but it would have been nice to get a heads-up!

Final remarks: Make reservations. The food is fresh and flavorful; the dessert being an obvious highlight. Expect a bit of a wait on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"It's a cute little to-go for sandwiches and salad across the Acardia farm cafe which is a sitting down restaurant. The blond girl at the register is absolutely rude, loud an obnoxious. She does not have any manner at all. Talk to customers without please and thank you. She needs to learn how to speak and not bark.

On to the food, the sandwiches are small and a little pricy. Not worth all the claim about the turkey and brie. Just sandwich, slices of apple and brie. You can make it at home."}
{"text":"This place had a great atmosphere for lunch, great people watching (Scottsdale women!) and great service. Food is a hit or miss . Some days I have a great experience and others I feel like the food is lacking in flavor and they are charging too much. It is not a cheap lunch but when it is good it is worth it ."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!!! Let's start there :) We had 2 different events here, and both turned out wonderful. They have private rooms for events with different options. Penny was our server and an exceptional lady at that :)) I still haven't been to the cafe itself, but the next chance I get, we will be coming back. Everyone chose different dishes, from salmon to crepes, all excellent dishes with a lot of flavor. The Tuxedo cake is a must try, a savory dessert ;) Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I must of been here during some sort of kitchen meltdown. I say that only because of the very good reviews and I KNOW NONE OF THEIR FOOD COULD HAVE TASTED LIKE MINE.

My whole experience was so bad it could have been a sitcom TV show.

We sit at a what could have been quaint table on the patio. The linen was crisp and clean. The glassware was spotless. The patio was cockeyed and the floor slanted and we just had to sit at an angle.I don't know if other patio tables here are like this but the two top one closest to the hostess stand is the one I'm talking about. It's the little table where you watch the people coming in.  I didn't think lunch would be terribly long so I thought it didn't matter but gosh if I was old I'd need a chiropractor for my hurt back. This was the most uncomfortable table I ever sat at in my whole life.

The iced tea I ordered tasted like bubble gum. ????????????

OK so now my back hurts and the iced tea is terrible but I'm still thinking things will be OK.

We wait and wait for our salads.

I decided to use the ladies room and gosh it was cold in there and if I had nuts they'd fall right off. HONEST it was like walking into a freezer. I guess women who are going threw hot flashes would love it.

We wait and wait and our waiter apologies to us and gives us refrigerator cold bread and ice hard cold but pretty swirled butter while we wait.

We finally get our salads AND THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD! But my chicken was dry ,it was so dry I think my throat could have gotten splinters and it's not just me being picky. My husband started eating my chicken and screamed about how dry it was. I think they cooked it for 45 minutes and that's what took so long. The salad looked beautiful but I couldn't eat it. A nice girl that worked there asked me about it and I told her the chicken was dry but I couldn't eat the salad because they didn't make the dressing right. I can't say for sure but I think the dressing was just oil with nothing else and it was horrible and not edible. This salad upset my stomach.

I did also speak to the manager who seemed concerned. The manager offered me dessert but I declined and he took $10. off the bill.

My husband said his shrimp were overdone and he wasn't sure if he had any dressing on his salad and thought he only had a little of the pesto from the shrimp on it. 

I did notice several large parties were in while I was there and that must have been contributing factor of the problem with the preparation of my meal.

I'm sure they are not like this most of the time and it was just me being here at the WRONG TIME.

Weird tasting iced tea.
uncomfortable table.
Ice cold restroom.
DRY not good Chicken.
Beautiful salad maybe just oil as dressing.

Not for me."}
{"text":"A friend & I had a lovely lunch here. We split the Brie w/ Carmelized Apples & an Asian Chicken Salad.  Everything was very fresh and flavorful.  Service was superb.
The only thing I would complain about is the price $29 for a salad and starter..... come on!   We only drank water....then there's the noise, sit outside if you can."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms....fresh, quaint, good service, great place for a ladies luncheon. 

The downside....my perfectly cooked salmon was bland and the tarragon dressing covering it and my salad was bland. 

At these prices $20/pp, the food better not be bland. 

Now the dessert are absolutely to-die-for!   I didn't come here for dessert alone though."}
{"text":"$8 for a tiny sandwich with one egg, two greasy strips of bacon, and a stale muffin. They say it's pricy because they get it local? It has to have substance to be considered anything. So whack."}
{"text":"Beyond words! This is the most special and girly spot possibly!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Great food, and GREAT service! I Have been here probably a dozen times, the food is always fresh and amazing, and the service is over the top. I have never had to wait longer then 10 minutes for a table! Great for a date, brunch with friends, and breakfast with family! 

If you haven't tried this place, definitely worth your time to stop by when you can!"}
{"text":"So disappointed today with Arcadia Farms Cafe. Met my friend today for brunch, I have been there many times for brunch. The service was, well actually, I don't really have a word for the service. Let me explain----after being seated at 10:30 we waited 10 minutes just for water. Another 10 minutes went by and I flagged down the host and asked if our server was around. She spoke to our server in passing, who rolled her eyes, pasted on a smile and took our order. Meanwhile, a couple with a young baby had sat down just adjacent to us, with the same server, and about 15 minutes later a 6 top of ladies sat on the other side of us. We did receive our food within a reasonable amount of time, thankfully. After 30 minutes the ladies still didn't have water, they went to the host and at that point decided to leave. I should state that the first server apparently was delegated to a different area, because we finished with a different server. The most disturbing part.....we left almost 2 hours later and the couple with the baby (remember them) HAD JUST RECEIVED THEIR FOOD!!!!!! Unacceptable service today!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the space/decor/patios!  So girly!

Food, meh.  I was super excited about the strawberry chicken salad, and it was all very tasty but the chicken was sooooooooooo dry.
I was disappointed.

Also, for a Sunday brunch, this place offered ZERO breakfast dishes.  Poo.

I'll be back, but I won't hurry back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Dined here for breakfast last Saturday morning. I drove in from Tucson to meet my family that was in from Kansas watching the Royals spring training. My sister found the Arcadia after inquiring at her hotel. Since there were 6 of us, she made a reservation. We were seated immediately. However, it took 10 minutes to get water, and we only began to get service after I spoke to the hostess that no one had stopped by our table. After the wait for water, we new we should be ready with our drink and food order right away. We ordered (we literally sat there for 20 minutes before we got coffee.) 
The food was delivered by a runner, and when 5 of us were served, she asked if \"there was anything else\"? Well, obviously, one of us didn't have their meal. We also had to ask for the two other side items we ordered.
So we proceed to eat and my sister says that her eggs are cold. (Thinking she is exaggerating, I touch them with the back of my hand.) Yep, cold. Not barely warm, cold. My daughters french toast was cold as well. The other meals were warmish. Not having the time left to send it back (working on 40 minutes now for breakfast) we ate what we could. I did not bring any of the issues up with management, as my brother in law paid the bill. If he wanted to say something, it was up to him.
Tons of seating, but not sure the staff could handle it. I Wouldn't/ couldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I feel like I am attending a tea party every time I go here.

I have tried three of their salads and all of them have been delicious. You cannot go wrong with the Signature Strawberry Salad with grilled chicken, vine-ripened strawberries, mixed baby greens, toasted almonds and poppyseed vinaigrette. It's mouth-watering! I have also had the Greek Salad which is yummy. 

Today, I tried the Raspberry Salad with Fossil Creek Goat Cheese, which has organically grown baby lettuces, fresh raspberries, warm goat cheese medallions, jicama, carrots, and candied pecans with a raspberry vinaigrette. I am not a fan of jicama - mainly because its tasteless. But this salad was AMAZING! I could of licked the plate but that would not have been very lady like of me. 

Overall, this is one of my favorite restaurants and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a breakfast/lunch spot in Old Town."}
{"text":"This place loses another star for employing a Gestapo-like Valet service that prevents anyone from parking on 1st Avenue  who is looking to eat somewhere else like America's Tacos.  I am baffled that Valet service exists out here and that they can successfully block off more than half the street."}
{"text":"Great food, but somewhat pricey and trendy (read: busy).  

Although I love the garden atmosphere-it caters to a certain type of clientele.  This is the type of place you see wedding parties or find a ladies bridge club...  I would not recommend for 'the bros' or a family outing.

Take the girlfriends, sip mimosas, eat the french toast and watch some Scottsdale wives."}
{"text":"Great menu, relaxing atmosphere, and outstanding service.  The decor was eclectic and unique with a rustic farmhouse feel.  The back patio seemed like a great place to host an event.  The menu items were interesting and everything tasted amazing.  Our server was very attentive, kind, and knowledgeable.   We arrived 30 minutes prior to lunch service, but received very prompt turn around on our lunch order nonetheless.  The avocado and crab tower was fantastic."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  Farm-to-table, fresh food is a huge favorite  for me.  However, it was pretty disappointing from the first moment.  

The hostess was missing and everyone else ignored us for a few minutes - no biggie, but not great.  We were eventually seated in a cute little outer building - this might have had potential, but it was freezing in the room.  

The biggest issues were the service and the food.  We had a terribly unpleasant server - she was brusque, forgot to leave the ice out of our water, and had a completely unapproachable manner.  She was busy, which was ok, but she barely checked on us - between that and her attitude, the problems we had were magnified.

First, the room freezing to the point I actually mentioned it her (ordinarily, I would never do that).  She adjusted the temperature, but another patron actually went over and adjusted the thermostat back.  Our server didn't ask us if the temperature was better or notice that it was set to cold again.  

The food was expensive and slightly below average.  

My husband's pricey yogurt parfait wasn't impressive, and his pastry, which we had really high hopes for, was just blah.  

I ordered an omelet with potatoes.  The omelet was just ok - a bit dry - but the potatoes plainly tasted like sausage and, since I don't eat meat, this was rather a large problem.  I asked the server if the potatoes could possibly have been cooked with meat.  She looked at me oddly (rudely) and told me they were absolutely not.  However, since they tasted like sausage to me and to my husband, I didn't eat them, and I didn't bother to ask for new ones.

Overall, a huge disappointment.  What a waste of such a cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"I will start with the good; the food was wonderful. The initial problem occured when  the hostess couldn't find our reservation. My friend showed the hostess the confirmation text on her phone. She says sorry I don't have it in our system. Finally the manager figured out that they put the reservation under Gloria. Umm yeah. We don't know a Gloria. The service was horrible. Our waitress was not friendly and looked stressed out.  A smile goes a long way. It took forever to get our food ordered. We got nothing pleasant from our waitress and was reluctant to take our group photo for our book club. Really? Lighten up.  We weren't giving her a hard time or anything.  She did take the photo and did a good job. At the end again, disappointment. Stressed out waitress, informed us to put away your birthday cupcakes you can't have them here. She was nice enough to ask the manager was it ok. We said never mind we will eat them outside. Yes, in 105 degrees. We were offered a birthday dessert for our book club friend. She declined; we were ready to go after that. it was not a good experience; it also ruined our book club experience.  I am sure that the waitress was having a tough day and I am sure things weren't all her fault, but sometimes you just have to roll with it and she did that poorly.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great baked goat cheese & humour appetizers. Sangria for two was actually enough for three."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place.  Rave reviews (mostly), and personal recommendations.  Heck, if you don't have a reservation you probably aren't getting in!  What a disappointment.  Even with the reservation we had to wait about 15 minutes.  Menu looked appetizing.  Sounded very up-scale!  

I had the salmon.  If you can call it that.  The actual salmon was microscopic.  A tiny piece perhaps 2\" square by about 1/2\" thick.  That's it.  The rest was \"greens\".  Apparently they expect you to fill up on \"greens\".  And the flavor of that miniscule bit of salmon was just ordinary.  Nothing special.

One person had a sandwich.  It was small, but bigger than the salmon.  It was reasonably tasty.  At least as good as Quiznos.  But, again, nothing special.

Also, you have to ask for bread service.  It's complimentary, but if you don't ask you don't get.  And the bread wasn't even warm.

The lemonade was really sub-par.  Not good.  The one bright spot was that their apricot tea is really outstanding.

If you like salads and \"greens\", you might like this place.  The person we went with had been there before, and she loved her strawberry salad.  But even she commented that the portion size had shrunk (she had never finished a whole serving before, but this time she did).  The other two salad-eaters in the group weren't as impressed (they didn't get the strawberry salad, though).

Overall...I'd skip this place.  Drop in and buy the tea (they sell it in leaf form), but skip the food.  Overpriced, undersized, and nothing special on the flavor front."}
{"text":"Got Corn? 
Our local friend brought us to this lovely restaurant after a crazy night of Halloween partying. The breakfast plates everyone ordered looked amazing. But I decided to get the Breakfast Quesadilla. Here's the thing. We all know what a Quesadilla consists of. The proper name should have been Cornadilla. It was all corn. The whole damn thing. One other guy at my table ordered it and we both agreed we had never seen so much corn on one table. I mean if you take the amount of corn in our quesadillas and pulled in a truck to haul it all out, you could probably feed the entire Ohio State team. There was so much corn on both our quesadillas that the table was tilting in our direction. When the waitress came by at the end and we mentioned that the corn was overwhelming she said \"well, sorry.\" We then apologized if we sounded rude to which she replied \"Yeah, you guys are.\" So it was obvious that she also was sensitive to the amount of corn this Quesadilla could somehow hold. It was as if someone had dared the Chef \"Let's see how much corn you can put on something before they realize we're punking them.\" 

Anyways, the rest of the food looked great. And the restaurant is beautiful. Oh, last thing....and I swear I'm not making this up. A bird took a dump on me right when I got there."}
{"text":"Beautiful cafe, great mimosa's in several varieties, and excellent strawberry chicken salad."}
{"text":"Great place, the food was awesome, the servers were friendly and prompt. The California club is really good, the humus was bland though.."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast with the freshest servings. No half-stale fruit whatsoever. Eggs were perfectly cooked, Applewood bacon had the perfect finish. Outdoor awning dining, friendly service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is aesthetically beautiful, but they continue to disappoint, this was my third visit for brunch, I requested a table they said was unavailable therefore they put me in a room where I was the only one seated. The table I initially requested was never set for the duration of my time eating my breakfast. I requested potatoes they arrived when I had completed my Croque madame, they apologized for the oversight yet they did not take the $3.00 charge off of my ticket. If this place had the food quality of Fa'me caffe or LGO it would be packed because of it's charm! They continue to miss."}
{"text":"Super homey and delightful cafe/restaurant with Southern charm and hospitality. We stopped in for lunch while in Scottsdale for vacation and had a great time. The food was delicious, wait staff was friendly, and the space is very homey. They have a fun garden in the back with outdoor seating and mist sprayers for when it's hot in the summer."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms is one of my favorite places to be.  Definetly a go to place for \"Ladies who Lunch\".  I love the charming decor and the intimacy of the environment.  It feels like being at a wonderful garden party.  The food is fresh and delicious the wine selection is good.  This is the place to go with your best girl friend for a good long chat."}
{"text":"I had no idea that the Little Gem was in Scottsdale... My colleague and I were on sales calls in Scottsdale and lunch time came around.. of course with so many great choices-Karen said \" Have you been to Arcadia Farms.. I said No I had hear great reviews but never went... WOW! The setting is something out of SOHO in NYC-- very trendy but authentic... Great service and I ordered the goat cheese, wild mushroom tart ( like a mini quiche without the egg...) so very buttery and gooey and tasty.. It was divine! Don't miss out on this sophisticated cafe.... Great food and the setting is like you are in an older home for the early 1900's.. patios and lace! Love it.."}
{"text":"Staff was rude, really unaccommodating to a group of elderly visitors, while I was a caregiver. And they don't split checks, which they told us beforehand when we made the reservation that they did. Food was over priced, and the girl with the nasty ace bandage around her wrist serving food made me want to barf. Will not be returning, ever! This review is overdue, and it was last year that I went, but didn't know the name of the place we ate after the museum."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about the Scottsdale location, I was looking forward to lunch at Arcadia Farms when visiting the museum for the Ansel Adams showing.  Unfortunately, it was a little disappointing.

Service was painfully slow.  I'm not sure if that was the kitchen or the server, but in either case, I was not impressed.

We started with the baked goat cheese.  For some reason, I envisioned the caramelized onions and roasted tomatoes atop the cheese, but everything was combined.  While it was quite good, only the bottom portion was hot.  The rest of it was only lukewarm.  I wondered if perhaps the dish is prepared ahead and refrigerated, resulting in the uneven temperature.

We also shared the smoked turkey and warm brie sandwich with white bean salad.  They generously served each of us a full side of the salad with our half sandwich, which was more than enough.  Although the sandwich had just been grilled, the inside was still somewhat cold.  I also would have preferred just a little more apple, but overall, it was A-OK.

The white bean salad with red peppers and possibly cucumber if I remember correctly was sorely lacking in flavor.  Salt helped, but not enough to save the dish.  If it was dressed with anything other than oil, I missed it.  

Arcadia is just fine if you're already at the museum and looking for a bite.  Otherwise, I don't know that I would return."}
{"text":"I went to this place based on reviews and either I have really good taste buds or the other reviews were written by people who haven't experienced great food before.  This was AWEFUL. My sandwich was slim on the turkey, brown edges on my limp lettuce and the bread must have been 2 or 3 days old, it kept falling apart.  Now i appreciate everyone's take on potato salad theirs was horrible.  Cut potato, undercooked with I believe to be a mayo with seasoning?  When service is better than food.  That's bad.  Speaking of service, sitting at my table waiting for a server to take my drink order, i was able to read the entire menu but when i have to ask for a refill on my tea from the hostess, that's bad.  I have a pending charge from this restaurant for 8.50 more than my receipt since i tip in cash.  They better hope that the total matches my receipt or heads will roll. Will not visit again"}
{"text":"What a find! Arcadia Farms is so charming and the food is delicious. We sat outside and enjoyed a lovely brunch. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast at Arcadia Farms Cafe on a sunny Sunday morning on their beautiful patio. The wait staff were pleasant and attentive and our breakfast was very good. We had the Wild Mushroom Omelet, a Strawberry Cream scone and their organic roast coffee. After breakfast we browsed through the variety of gifts and food at The Marketplace nextdoor and I will definitely return here to shop when I have more time. 

I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy! After years of enjoying a sit-down experience at Arcadia Farms and months of anticipation for the marketplace doors to open, I can officially say that I am one very happy yelper! 

First of all, I want to wrap the Arcadia Farms Marketplace up and put it in my pocket; it's so cute inside and out! It's like a dream farmhouse and one I could be quite comfortable in for hours. Maybe it has something to do with the tasty sweets and treats staring me in the face too.

The marketplace is stocked full of food for all and friendly staff serving it. I always loved visiting the Phoenix Art Museum Arcadia Farms because I'd have a great chat with Lisa G. So, needless to say how pleased I was when I walked into the Marketplace to see her behind the counter! We had a great chat and she told me all about the wonderful items they serve! They have everything from tea packets and flowers to scones, cookies, brownie pops and nutella. They also have their miniature cakes ready for purchase as well as their tasty iced tea and lemonade. The salads are pre-made every morning and waiting in the refrigerator to be eaten. They have tuna nicoise, turkey club, their famous strawberry chicken salad, a garden salad, pasta salad and chicken curry salad with raspberry sauce. They also have a detailed breakfast and sandwich menu that are made-to-order. Besides a couple classics, this menu is different and it's lower in price. The sandwiches range from roast beef and mozzarella and to pressed chicken. They have a lot of options on the menu. I also heard they are introducing a limited dinner menu. It's still not a \"cheap\" meal, but it's competitive to other lunch options out there at about $8-$9 for a sandwich and $8-$9 for a salad. 

So now that I've given a recap of what I saw at the marketplace, I will report on what I ate! It was tough...so tough to decide between a sandwich and salad. I wanted both! Then the more I looked at the chicken curry salad, the more appealing it looked, so I opted for that. Verdict? Very pleased!! The chicken curry has a sweetness to it and then the raspberry dressing is the perfect addition. Arcadia Farm's pesto shrimp salad is addicting and I think that this one might be up there with that level of addiction! It was the perfect size and filled me up without making me want to roll out of there. For my beverage, I went for the raspberry ice tea. And yes, today I decided my sweet tooth would win over my willpower, so I took a lemon cake muffin for the road. In summary, it was a very summeresque meal and very fulfilling! I sat outside at their tables in the front. I wish they had indoor seating but it seems like the indoor seating is only for the private event catering. But then again, this is a marketplace and the purpose is for people to get in and out. 

Speaking of the private catering room, it is absolutely adorable in there. Arcadia Farms is the perfect place for a bridal or baby shower or ladies lunch, but the restaurant itself can be a little cramped so it makes it hard. Therefore, this is a great alternative! If I ever need to plan a ladies-only party, hands-down this will be my first choice. 

In summary, I definitely see myself becoming a regular at the Arcadia Farm's Marketplace. I still love the sit-down Arcadia Farms, but when I don't have time to sit down and have a ladies lunch, I'm very happy that they've given me this alternative!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! It's like being in a little cafe in Paris. The decor is beautiful and the service is amazing! Our waitress was the best! The food is super fresh, delicious & they serve large portions. I've been here twice and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"How charming is this place?! The moment I stepped through the doors, I was instantly drawn in by it's ambience. I certainly didn't feel as though I were still in Phoenix, for it had a southern Californiaesque vibe to it. 

Putting the California vibe aside, as my friend and I sat took our seats, I noticed that the place had a beautiful back patio, but it was the lunch crowd, so we were unable to snag a place in the great outdoors. Simple decor, neutrals, browns, wine bottles, greenery, and fresh air added to
the ambience. 

We ordered from our server right away which was great, despite the  crowd. When she came back with our ice tea, little did I know that I would
taste the best ice tea I've ever had. I was so intrigued by the flavour, that
I actually bought a package before I left.

Thus, came the food. It took a while, but good conversation made up for the wait. I ordered the Mediterranean Melt. Awesome. Roasted eggplant, red pepper, sauteed onions, portobello mushroom, smoked mozzeralla, pesto spread all combined between crunchy ciabatta bread. I think with my first bite, I had a heart attack (because I loved it so ), and was revived again when I drank my apricot ice tea (because I loved it so).  I cannot 
forget the salad that came with the sandwich. A simple field green salad
that complimented my sandwich quite well. Overall, it was a big portion of a lunch that I normally don't indulge in. The sandwich was $12 and the ice tea was ??--but I would've paid $10 for a glass of their ice tea. It was a great lunch..Thank you Arcadia Farms

{"text":"My picture is next to the definition of a picky eater and I loved this place! I had the best omelet one day and went back the next day for lunch. The food tastes as good as the staff is friendly! Can you give a place 6 stars? Loved it!"}
{"text":"I went to Arcadia Farms Cafe for brunch with my best friend from out of town on July 5th. When we entered this quaint restaurant we were pleasently surprised. The ambiance of the area had an antique feel and there were these adorable clocks on the walls. My friend and I ordered the french toast. It was pretty basic but the strawberries on it made the dish outstanding. The waitress was nice enough, did not talk much but that is ok since it was a \"quiet\" place. I want to go back and try more things on the brunch menu but I wish brunch was served a bit longer than 11am. On the weekends I like to sleep in. I would go back to Arcadia Farms Cafe."}
{"text":"Food was great but service was horrible! We had a reservation and the hostess told us we didn't. My friend who made the reservation had to pull up her confirmation.. They had to get the manager. It was resolved but not the best first impression. Next, it took the waitress FOREVER to take our orders. She said they were extra busy. Next we have a book club meet and it was my birthday celebration. The ladies had bought me cupcakes and then we were told oh you guys can't bring outside food. No one told you. Blah blah. Needless to say it ruined the experience. Later they came back and said I could get complimentary dessert and eat it outside but at that point, I just wanted us to leave and enjoy our desserts outside. This was my first time here and I believe last time."}
{"text":"My mom and I have gone here for years to celebrate Mother's Day. I want to say I ADORE the atmosphere of Arcadia Farms. I want to live there. However, the last couple times we have gone, the food has been lacking. The chicken sandwich was bland, everything needed salt and the crab and avocado tower was not only bland and flavorless but extremely watery. We didn't finish it. Strawberry shortcake was delicious. We have decided to only go back for the ambiance and will have wine and cheese. Probably won't bother ordering additional food.  I am giving 3 stars instead of 2 due to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch with my girlfriends. Its def a spot for the \"ladies who lunch\". I never considered myself  a \"lady who lunches\" but since I am now being classified as \"too old\", I will now refer to myself as a \"lady who lunches\". I might as well start wearing my floral dresses and Sunday hats as well. 
This is also the spot to come to on all of the beautiful sunny AZ days, the patio is a fantastic place to sit and enjoy the sun and the accompaniment of your friends.
My experience has been that the service is not the best (I had to ask for my creamer to go with my tea twice last time I went) but the food makes up for it.
Most every time I go, I have to have the goat cheese and raspberry salad. It feeds my goat cheese addiction. The crab and avocado stack is also pretty tasty. My friend I usually go there with always has the chicken and strawberry salad. I guess the homemade strawberry dressing is \"out of this world\". 
If you like lemon, try the lemon sugar cookies. They have the perfect balance.....not overly sweet.
Next time I will be sure to wear my Sunday hat."}
{"text":"Lucky for this restaurant, the delicious  overpriced food and quaint cottage atmosphere, outshines the thankless and unappreciative behavior of the hostess at the front door.   In this situation, one bad apple  doesn't spoil the whole bunch"}
{"text":"Certainly not a place for male bonding or a guys night out but this restaurant has the right mix if you need to take the girls from the office out for lunch to thank them for all the great work they do for you at the office.

The food is very pleasant and is a tasty artisanal version of a combination of country and home cooking. Everything that we had from salads to sandwiches and the desserts were delicious."}
{"text":"Imagine a charming French country cottage with an equally charming patio that is completely walled in from the outside world.  This restaurant is tucked away on a quiet side street in downtown Scottsdale away from most of the tourist shops and the Fashion Square area.  I had lunch here on a weekday, so it was on the quiet side.  The patio is the place to be on a nice Arizona day.  It is well-shaded by trees and umbrellas so even on a warmish day it will be fine.  My friend and I enjoyed our lunch, the friendly service and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok so parking was iffy. There's a sign that said there's valet but I don't see where to go. 

We were told a 15 minute wait for 2 people when we came in at 11a. You would have to wait outside because it's cramped in the hostess area with some ill-placed separators. There's the pastry case in front but it didn't looked appealing as it was very meager in offerings and just out in the open like that. 

Unfortunately we were seated at the ultra small table in the literal middle of everything. Another 15 mins went by before we got some water.  

We got hummus as a starter and herb chicken sandwich for myself and SO got the wild mushroom crepes. 

Hummus was pretty weird. I did not enjoy it. It was super cold and grainy. They mixed in celery to fill it and the taste and texture is way off. I am not a hummus snob, and it's pretty hard to mess it up but this failed. 

SO didn't mind crepes. It's balled up crepes flooded with a cream and cheese sauce that reminds me of Olive Garden. I only tasted the sauce and it's pretty heavy.

My chicken sandwich was incredibly dry. It was supposed to have artichokes, pesto, sun fried tomatoes. It came and you can only discern red colored chicken since everything was mixed. I managed 4 bites and could not go on. A very small plus was the side salad with radicchio was delicious. I finished that.   

Pretty pricey but I guess it's more for the organicness of it. It's a bit pretentious, I feel (iced tea in a small wine glass)! You will see a lot of gals in their summer dresses dining here. 

To finish up this nice brunch was the lady server said she would get our check and took yet another 15 mins to do so. 

Also, we heard the lady tell a party she will not be able to seat 8 people but will make it work if they combine the patio tables outside. It's true. The seating is friendly towards 4 people max inside. Maybe 5 if you managed to grab a booth. 

So I would try salads if you go here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Love to sit outside in the back the best ! I try to go as often as people will go with me ! The strawberry chicken salad is always my favorite and is a must try ! Today my friend really enjoyed their Greek salad as well ! Everything here is absolutely delicious ! Service is always top notch as well ! Highly recommend this spot to anyone and everyone !"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant a week ago and have already returned because it was so delicious.  First of all the setting is so lovely.  We felt so relaxed with beautiful, beach-esque decorations and materials.  The real star here is the outstanding cuisine.  Everything is fresh and delightful.  I loved the coffee, breads, pastries and even the simple foods like bacon and eggs are a cut above.  In my family, my wife always eats the healthy options and I am a glutton for everything fattening.  This placed served us both wonderfully at the same time."}
{"text":"After beer and ballpark food at Spring Training it was nice to enjoy an elegant brunch here at Arcadia Farms. It definitely feels like a little french cottage and the highly coveted patio seating is perfect for a ladies who lunch type event. I enjoyed the strawberry salad and the scones were delicious. Service was a bit on the slow side, but that may just be the vibe of the place. 

As an SF food snob, I really enjoy a place that cares so much about the quality of their produce and being able to enjoy local and organic ingredients in my meal (I know, you're rolling your eyes, I've accepted it).

Bonus points for giving a discount if you show your Giants game ticket! :)

Given the lovely patio and experience, I will take off no stars for the fact that a very rude bird pooped on my husband."}
{"text":"Buddy.

If you're reading this, you need a place to eat brunch. Go ahead and X out of your browser, slowly close your laptop, hop up from the couch and get going to Arcadia Farms. You can trust me. I live in Chicago. I know what's a good brunch.

I'm more interested in just what kind of standards the people that gave this place less that 5 stars have. Must be a nice life they're leading. Any of you want to be friends? I'm game. DM me. 

In all seriousness, the food is really good, the service is really good, the decor is really good. And even though I was just visiting Scottsdale, I find it very hard to believe you're going to find a better spot for brunch. Anywhere. 

BTW - the first thing they do is give you a plate full of the best strawberry scones you've ever had... for free!   

Internet high-five, Arcadia Farms."}
{"text":"Delicious dishes for lunch & brunch-I've enjoyed both with groups of friends. I love their coffee, the lemon cookies, and their sandwiches. 
Polly was an excellent server who was welcoming, knowledgeable about the menu, & perfectly on par with her recommendations! Every time I've flown into Arizona I come here! The market store is equally amazing & great for loading up on more pastries. The gf cookie is heavenly!!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice. I believe the place use to be a house and was turned into a restaurant. Their food is alright, I feel you can easily make the foods they serve but worth a try! Their service is alright as well. I give it a 4 because it's kinda pricey for foods you can easily do at home."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast quesadilla. As far as quesadilla's go is was pretty good. I loved that combination, seasonal veggies, sausage, egg, cheese. They could be a little more generous with the protein, and most of the quacamole was turning brown (not exactly appetizing), but overall it was good. The salsa that it came with was the redeemed the old guacamole.

However, the person who served the guacamole could have been a little more sensible and not served brown guac. Instead, it looked like it was mixed in with the nice looking guacamole as if I wouldn't notice."}
{"text":"Excellent strawberry chicken salad. Outside eating area is mist cooled and shady. Attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite for many.  Excellent food and known for their signature baby cakes.  It is a little lighter fare though so you may need an appetizer and dessert.  Very popular for ladies lunches, birthdays, and showers.  Great atmosphere with a very friendly staff.  I like to bring my wife here because she loves it.  My mom loves it as well.  I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Can't say if the food is good.  Never got an opportunity to eat.  Service was SO UNBELIEVABLY BAD that we finally left after 45 min of waiting for our waiter to come to our table to even acknowledge us again after getting us our water."}
{"text":"My daughter and  friends celebrated her 15th birthday there today. Everyone was amazingly kind and helpful. They brought out a cake, the room was very nice where they sat and the food was delicious. The employee in the Market was friendly and helpful. It was a great day."}

This a number one champion sound
Yelp Elites, we about to get down
Who's up for brunch in the town right now?
Just touched down in Oldtown
Bet they give me a pound cake
Tell them put the Mimosa in my hand right now
Tell the hostess we need more seats
We just told out all the floor seats

Take me to a Farms, I'd like to go someday
Take me to Scottsdale, I'd love to see the Cafe
I really want to...come brunch it with you
I'll be at Arcadia Farms



Arcadia Farms Cafe is a farm to table concept, but has been around for the past decade as a hot spot to brunch; and who doesn't like brunch!?

I came with some friends on a lovely Sunday afternoon.  The place is cute as hell yo!  It's like walking into Martha Stewarts home!  As we proceeded to the patio I couldn't help but felt a tad bit posh.  G'day ma'dam!

Anyways, as we sat they started off by serving some delectable strawberry scones to start!  I tell ya; probably the best scones I've ever had and they were free making it even better!  I'm sure one way or another I paid for it though haha!  They were soft to the bite with a perfect flakiness that was not overly falling apart.  It was a perfect pairing with my coffee!  For my entree I ordered their Fresh Berry Crepes; wrap with mascarpone cheese and topped with whipped cream, berries, and candied almonds.  You'd think this was pretty sweet, but instead it was very light and fluffy!  The almonds brought the crunch along with the subtle mascarpone bringing in that after sweetness.

Overall, a solid place for a brunch date or a day with the gals.  I fortunately were with 4 lovely ladies and we had a blast at Arcadia Farms;  guys are welcomed too, but only if you're wearing a bow-tie...wink! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and very friendly service! Only had dessert, but they were great...looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to places to bring my out of town company. Arcadia farms is so quaint and unique. I love sitting out back and feel like I'm in a old fashion back yard!  The food is great. I typically order the strawberry chicken salad with poppyseed dressing and OMG IT iS TO DIE FOR!  Then to top it off I indulge in coconut cream cake... You haven't lived till you taste a dessert like that.  I might have been drooling! They have a small market next door to buy more coconut cake.  Make reservations as it gets real busy when the snow birds fly in!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed at a (terrible) hotel just 2 blocks from Arcadia Farms and found it quite by accident on our second day.  We loved it so much we ate breakfast AND lunch there every day for the remaining 4 days of our trip!  Excellent food; great music; shabby chic ambiance.  If you can sit at a table at which Debbie is serving, you'll be SO happy and get great service, too.  She's terrific.  And I REALLY recommend that you reserve a table if you're coming for lunch - this place is so fabulous that it is crowded.  My personal favorites:  the chocolate toffee muffin at breakfast and/or the leek, mushroom tart  and for lunch, the ham \"sandwich\" which is exceptionally good.  Or the strawberry chicken salad...or the coconut cake which is worth every calorie...or the iced tea...or the lunch crepes with wild leeks and chicken...pretty much we tried everything on the menu and everything was completely exceptional.  And the back patio is SO peaceful and relaxing."}
{"text":"so if i was grading this place solely on SERVICE it would get a NEGATIVE 10. the service here sucks. or maybe they hate asians? or anyone who isn't a rich white Scottsdale-ian? whatever, but i NEVER get good service here, i always get seated outside, in this hidden corner............. what the. i actually don't know why i keep coming back.

oh, yes i do. it's the chicken crepe. that is some good chicken. it's amazing. so that's how an awesome chicken crepe took a negative 10 to a positive 2 stars.

their baked goods, i do not recommend. mainly because our server recommended the red velvet cake to us, saying it was a best-seller, and how everyone loved it, blah blah blah... and it was THE WORST cake EVERRRRR. it was gross.

and actually... the only good things that i've had here are the chicken crepe and the cobb salad. everything else has been gross. the appetizers, the crab cakes, the soup.....

and back to the crap-ola service: i brought my mom and sister here for some fun \"girl time\".... and this was on a rainy/dreary day in december... and they would NOT seat us inside. the snot-faced girl at the front (she's always there and ALWAYS snotty, i totally forgot her name - i actually read her name tag JUST because i wanted to yelp her name....... bummer) said they were completely booked inside. which i dunno, it was pretty empty when we got there and still empty when we left. so whatever. so they seated us OUTSIDE. and then had the nerve to say that the heat lamps were probably not working. uh, great. so i had to beg them to TRY and turn on the heat lamps. 

anyways, mom and sis were not impressed. we had a bad time. and now i will never be back. and i'm sure they won't care, because i'm probably not the clientele that they want. whatevs."}
{"text":"This place was a great surprise.  I thought it would be intimidating based on their website, but I felt immediately at home, they were even welcoming to our sleeping baby.  The server was extremely friendly, and altered everything to be completely veg-friendly for us.  The food was great, and the desserts blew us away.  We were very, very happy with our visit."}
{"text":"We went to Arcadia Farms for breakfast during a trip to Scottsdale. Cute place with nice patio seating. Fresh ingredients. We had the egg strata and the fresh berry crapes, both were great. I would give this a higher rating except the service was so bad. Waitress was basically non-existent. We couldn't get the bill without flagging her down, she acted as if she was too busy to answer questions or check in. If you have time to linger, give it a try, otherwise, there are other nearby options."}
{"text":"Came for brunch but missed it.  Luckily, lunch was pretty amazing!  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"wow ! We just had another amazing lunch at Arcadia Farms. The food is always superb, the pastries divine, and the service is friendly and efficient. This oasis of a restaurant is one of the first I visited in this town, and one of the best, still, 10 years later. the menu is always changing and diverse, and has wonderful vegetarian items as well. The owner is always adding fabulous gift items in the market, so if you don't know it, they have great gifts for the foodie in your life too. Any budding chef would appreciate these thoughtful items, and I am guilty of many a random purchase for my wife who is the chef in our family. Arcadia is a beautifully appointed , farm to table privately owned, jewel ! We are lucky to be able to visit  often.

{"text":"If you're throwing a bridal shower or baby shower BEWARE. You are told one thing then given a contract that states your event would be cancelled the DAY OF if you have more than the agreed upon amount of people. This will never be mentioned in your emails or conversations, just a note that you will be \"uncomfortable\" if there are more people. As a host, how can you control people who choose to show up but don't rsvp? No one in their right mind would agree to risk their event being cancelled the day of. You will deal with two different people who give you different information but then don't make up for their mistakes but just \"promise you a good time\". Then you will attempt to call them many times over the course of planning your event, only to never receive phone calls back. Arcadia farms obviously hosts many showers and you will be treated as such-- A dime a dozen. They don't care about the customer, just about how much money they make. My advice is to find another venue. There are many, many more options in Scottsdale that are willing to help not just take your money."}
{"text":"I had the most beautiful bridal shower at Arcadia Farms in their Hacienda room! The ONLY somewhat negatives are that the room is across from the actual restaurant and parking can be a bit of a challenge. The room, service and food were absolutely amazing for my tea party themed shower. Service was attentive, food was delicious (especially the desserts) and the space was nice and cool on a warm day. I would totally recommend having a private party here and going across the street and eating at the actual restaurant. Perfect!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Visited recently and had the Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad - YUMM-O!  I've had several things off their menu over the years and everything is always fresh and flavorful.   If you go, you must save room for dessert!  Two words - Baby Cakes!!   If you can't eat dessert on your visit, buy some baked items to take home!  The granola is outstanding too!!

Atmosphere is charming - like visiting an old friends' home.  I can't wait for the weather to cool off because eating on their side patio area is adorable!  You really won't believe you are sitting in the heart of Scottsdale - like being in a villa in Tuscany!!  

There is a reason this place has been a Valley destination for \"ladies who lunch\" and just about anyone who has ever had or attended a shower (bridal or baby) has probably celebrated at least once at AF!  It seems like every weekend there is someone having a party here!  

Heard the waitress talking to another table that you can reserve use of the entire place for evening events!  Would be a sweet set up for a party - to have the entire place to yourself....like entertaining at home without all the clean up!  Nice!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, little over priced and service is average! But overall great environment and tasty."}
{"text":"The ambiance and service is amazing. We sat outside and really enjoyed the experience. The food was better than average but not the best I've had. We had an omelette and the smoked salmon plate."}
{"text":"Everyone has a favorite lunch spot or two that they frequent regularly... well, maybe not everyone, but I do!  Arcadia Farms - Scottsdale happens to be one of mine.  Since I'd never been to the Arcadia Farms location at the Phoenix Art Museum, I thought I'd change it up a bit and suggested this location for a business lunch the other day...

I arrived early and the place was pretty empty, so it was no problem to get a table and do some work while I waited.  The waitress was friendly (not super friendly but just fine) and brought me a mango iced tea- my favorite - just like the Arcadia Farms Scottsdale!  I perused the menu and noticed some similarities on the menu, but a few different options too.  My usual favorite salad (grilled vegetable with chicken) was not on the menu but there were a few items that were different and sounded good.  I was up in the air between the california roll salad and the greek... I opted for the greek and added shrimp.  

Side note - usually, at the other location, they bring fresh bread... we did not receive bread nor were we offered bread at this location.  

Anyways, our food arrived pretty quickly - and my salad was good... not great, but good.  It was served with a small portion of hummus and a couple pita triangles, but I wasn't too impressed with the flavor of the hummus.  The salad had a few too many onions in it (but i guess that's my fault; I could've ordered it without onions).

All in all, I had a lovely lunch as I was in great company and my food was fine.  I would go back but maybe order something different next visit.  And if I had the choice, I'd go to one of the other locations (maybe City Bakery or the Heard Museum) over this one.  But I will say, that if you're at the Phoenix Art Museum and in the mood for a light lunch or snack, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"It's no secret that I'm a huge fan of Arcadia Farms, and when I heard they were going to be opening a marketplace across the street, I was psyched.  Of course, this was many months ago... So when I woke up this morning to see an email in my inbox (thanks Lisa G) saying that they were now open for business, I was very excited and knew immediately where to go for lunch.  

Needless to say, I made it a priority to get there asap (I didn't want to miss the opportunity to get the FTR).  While it's different than I expected, I was pleasantly surprised!  

The menu is diverse and includes many of the AF signature items such as the Mushroom, Spinach & Goat Cheese Tart, the Strawberry Chicken Salad, and their extraordinary desserts.  In addition, they offer plenty of new options such as a Chopped Italian Salad, a Tuna Nicoise Salad, and a Roasted Artichoke & Ricotta Cheese sandwich.  There is a daily soup, and plenty of breakfast items (think everything from muesli to quiche, muffins, croissants, and granola parfaits).  Arcadia Farms' famous apricot iced tea is also on the menu, as well as a full coffee menu. 

I went with the  AF Breakfast Sandwich ($6.95).  It's an MJ English muffin, scrambled eggs, aged cheddar cheese, and your choice of ham or bacon.  They made it with egg whites for me, and it was delicious.  My dining companions had a sandwich and soup, respectively.  Everything is made to-go, but there is plenty of seating outside if you choose to dine there like we did today.  

Marketplace offers a simpler fast/casual option for breakfast, lunch, or a comforting snack in Old Town... They use natural, organic, and local products, and it shows.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  I anticipate this being a welcome addition to my \"rotation\" of go-to spots in my 'hood."}
{"text":"Love the crepes, eggs, potatoes and bacon. All the starters are fabulous. Mimosas were on the ok level. You can't do a better brunch spot on a fall Saturday."}
{"text":"Two words: coconut cake. Literally the main reason I keep going back to this place. Most recently I had the \"breakfast panini\" which was dry and not pressed as a panini should be. They used to have the MOST AMAZING salmon salad but don't get excited because they took it off the menu. Avoid sitting on the out skirts of the patio as you will be drenched with dripping from the misters. Mimosa was not worth $9- like it's 2018 have a $5 mimosa for me for brunch, I just hiked Camelback. They had ran out of the fresh squeezed OJ so I enjoyed two very average mimosas. Why get two if you are complaining about the price you ask.... YOU DON'T KNOW MY LIFE. Even with the negatives I'll be back because this place is cute, maybe one day the salmon salad will return and coconut cake. Also planning my unconvinced babies shower here. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"My go to place to not only meet friends, but always take our visitors here. It is one of the most consistently fabulous meals, not only for lunch but brunch as well.  The best humus ever, and every salad is delicious. I suggest always make a  reservation, especially if you want to sit outside. Parking is a nightmare if valet is full. Service is exceptional as always!!!"}
{"text":"Lovely spot, comfy seating on cushioned benches outside and big couches and chairs inside. Our very sweet server, Polly, made great recommendations and an awesome white sangria! Food was fantastic and generous portions. Get the warm Brie with caramelized apples for the table!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Seriously couldn't ask for anything better. The service was wonderful and helpful and the food was fantastic - fresh, healthy, local. We ordered the crab & avocado tower to start. Phenomenal. For my entree, I ordered the Roasted Salmon Super Salad (photo). The portion was great with plenty of greens and fish. Another member of our party ordered the garden vegetable & chicken quesadilla (photo) - she thought it was excellent. Other items ordered: the trio of bruschetta, the farmer's market fresh fruit crisp, coffee, and freshly brewed peach unsweetened iced tea. Prices were right for the portions and freshness and everything was outstanding! The restaurant itself is what pushes this place from 4 to 5 stars: it's cute with a very nice ambiance and decor. There's street parking and valet parking."}
{"text":"I am here for a party.  The place we reserved was not available so we got a private room-which is nice.  Our waiter is working across the street and here.  He is nice but very scatter brained (because he was running between the restaurant and the party room).  I would not recommend this place for a party - but the good was very good.
The reservations for our party were made weeks ahead of time - so the management was aware of us being there.  Management did not staff the place accordingly - (yea on the restaurant / food - - boo on the management)"}
{"text":"The food is good, but service struggles during breakfast at this pretty little place in Scottsdale. I've been a few times in the last month with work colleagues. Plenty of parking on the street out front during weekday morning. The place has always been mostly empty one my visits but the one server seemed really frazzled. I was finished with my first cup of coffee before my friends decaf arrived. And my colleagues were half done with their omelette and and tarts by the time my bowl of muesli was delivered. We had to flag (literally waving arms) done the waitress to refill our water and coffee.

Though service is scattered, the food is really good. The complimentary strawberry scones dusted with powdered sugar are tasty and the muesli is some of the best I've had ever- creamy, loaded with cinnamon, diced fruit, golden raisins, nuts. I wouldn't be my first choice given all the service issues, but if the meeting is scheduled for this place at least the breakfast is tasty."}
{"text":"Terribly understaffed.  We had a 10 minute wait for a hostess to greet and seat us.  After being seated, we waited 22 minutes before walking out.  My first restaurant experience in Scottsdale was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Super cute place but underwhelming food and over priced. $16 for a small to medium sized salad! And the potato salad that came with my bf's sandwich was mediocre at best. And there really is no excuse at a fancy restaurant in old town for a server not to write down an order, and then have to come back after 2 times of saying our food will be up shortly and then a 3rd time having to come back and ask what it was we ordered in the first place!"}
{"text":"Dining at Arcadia Farms reminds me fondly of the \"L'Idiot\" bistro in the movie L.A. Story, where Steve Martin and the cast enjoy an absurd brunch in a satire-like restaurant and order daft items like \"a half double decaffeinated half-caf, with a twist of lemon\" and \"decaffeinated coffee ice cream\".    

Its exactly like this at AC.  Slightly cartoon-y, almost a parody of itself, but kind of charming in a way that makes you realize that you sit firmly on the outside of this demographic.  I find this kind of setting immensely charming, as did Steve Martin, and wryly grinned his way through haute fare and caricatures.  

My gf and I smartly decided to pinch our way into Easter Brunch here after failing at Cafe ZuZu (fortunately) and Trader Vic's (thankfully), and ended up having, what can be described as the most exemplary Easter Brunch imaginable; wrought iron bistro table-tops for two, shady oaks, white linen table cloths, brick pathways, french doors, and aproned servers.

Brunch started off with breadrolls and a bottle of Fume Blanc, which was very crisp, but not tart.  A perfect brunch choice.  My gf ordered the raspberry stuffed french toast (which, as selections go, was my first choice, but was nice enough to concede the dish to her) and I chose the Breakfast Bruschetta.  We sipped our wines and waters on a very calm and cool back patio, thankful that we found a perfect spot for such an occasion on the fly.

About 20 minutes later, our meals were delivered and i was immediately satisfied with the presentation.  The bruschetta consisted of egg, sausage, and mozza on french baguette slices.  It was delicious.  The french toast was seasoned perfectly, and the raspberry and strawberries on top were a nice compliment, although, the menu claimed infusion of raspberries, and I could not detect anything resembling that.

The desserts were tempting, but we were satisfied with the wine as a digestif, though we ended up gorging ourselves shortly afterward with mechiladas and Belgian beers at the Vig, anyway, so dessert should have been in order.  

Just something to make up for on our next visit."}
{"text":"Want to join the \"ladies who lunch\" crowd? Arcadia Farms is the spot to do it. It's an adorable little cottage with outdoor garden seating, and frilly decor, giant goblets of iced tea, huge salads, and irresistible baked goods. 

I had a shrimp salad that was that perfect balance of healthy and filling. Prepare to pay \"special occasion\" lunch prices ($25-30 pp)... it adds up quickly. Service was beyond friendly!"}
{"text":"Rosemary, thank you so very much for making my day out with my mother so enjoyable. Her handicap truly limits our ability to do much these days but you were so accommodating and kind, thank you. This is her favorite restaurant and she enjoyed every bit... Our lunch was Delicious! Thank you again.
Sherry Handzel"}
{"text":"Shared a nice outside brunch with a friend on Sunday.  I love the feel of the place (clean and cozy).  The food was very delicious too!  Service was on the slower side.
I ordered the Breakfast Panini:  egg, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, arugula and roasted tomato.  The sandwich was pressed nice and crispy.  I added breakfast potatoes (some of the bigger chunks were not completely cooked yet).   

I give it overall a 3.5.  I would love to come back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! It seems like you're in a cafe in a small, quaint town! The farm to table is definitely a plus for this place as well! I got the bean omelet and it was delicious. Our server even brought us some scones on the house and they were scrumptious. Only vice: The birds. For some reason the birds were everywhere here on the back patio. Otherwise, definitely would return to try more of their baked goods and more items on their menu!"}
{"text":"It is a very beautiful cafe and the food and staff is great. The reason I didn't give five stars is that their rest room is kinda awkward area of the room and it was a bit hard to find a parking near the cafe. Otherwise it was wonderful experience ! Love to go back!"}
{"text":"Arcadia Farm is a Phoenix standby, I moved here over 10 years ago, it was thriving then and it's still thriving. It's a ladies who lunch kind of place full of nutritious, delicious light lunch fares and a wait staff with extremely low turn over. It is not surprising to find a wait staff who has worked there for over ten years. 
I used to go there often with clients when I had my architectural office but it's been years since I was there last. 
When Lindsey organized a CMYE $3 donation (for a delicious baby cake) to St. Mary's Food Bank, I happily signed up. 
There were 15 of us there and we were seated in a private back room with fresh flowers on the table, very nice. 
The waitress was very friendly and bragged about the owner which is always a good sign when the staff is happy. My friend and I ordered the crab cake and grilled shrimp salad to share and although it took awhile for the food to arrive, it was delicious. 
They also surprised us with complimentary hummus, pasta with grilled shrimp, and a desert tray. So really, we didn't have to order any food and we would have been plenty full!
The generosity of the owner who I hope one day to have the pleasure to meet as she seems like the kind of wonderful lady I would enjoy sharing a conversation with, is apparent. And this stands to reason why after so many years when many restaurants have opened and closed, Arcadia Farm is still as successful and popular as ever. 
I and Yelp thank you for a generous and enjoyable afternoon of lunching!"}
{"text":"Charming outdoor garden seating area and friendly staff. The chicken quesadilla was simple and satisfying. We enjoyed the accompanying guac and spicy green salsa. I had the grilled vegetable salad with chicken, which was fresh, but the vegetables seemed to be sauteed, not grilled and the lime vinaigrette was bland. I'd recommend Arcadia for a relaxing lunch in the sun, but it's not a spot for a fine culinary experience."}
{"text":"Yet another amazing meal.  I come here every single time I am in town.  The decor is to die for and makes you feel warm and cozy.  

I always get the pesto shrimp salad.  I actually go home (back to Hawaii) wishing I could eat it all the time.  The shrimp are fresh, tasty greens, awesome dressing and lots of fresh corn and avocado.  Thanks Arcadia Farms, you will see me again!"}
{"text":"Overall, I really enjoy this cafe. It's quaint, the food is good, and they have a cute, shady patio for you to take advantage of. Sometimes the servers are hard to pin down, but on my last visit, Pam was amazing. When my sister mentioned that we were celebrating our mother's birthday, Pam brought out an adorable mini cake with a candle. (We really appreciated that!)

I was a little disappointed with my Fresh Berry Crepes. For the price they charged ($13) I didn't expect to have canned? frozen? blueberries on them. (They did include fresh strawberries though.) However, I wanted to keep five stars on my review because I think their Strawberry Chicken Salad and Herb Roasted Chicken are delicious. 

If you're meeting friends for lunch, this is a great choice. They also seem to celebrate a lot of baby and bridal showers. Overall- it's a solid choice for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Extremely over rated restaurant the food is very bland. You can open any bag of lettuce and dress it poorly to get the same result. The service was terrible. The waitresses are rude and once they take your order you will never see them again 

When I asked what was recommended the waitress was completely put out. When i asked for a four top in the main dining room the miserable idiot they hired for a hostess could not have been less gracious., she wanted to put us in the back shitty add on when the main dining room was 1/2 full  Their style is pure 70's shabby chic gone stale. The food cannot amaze anyone unless you have been living on hospital food. Do not waste your time and money. This place has jumped the shark."}
{"text":"Coming in from out of time I found out that a reservation was needed for the main restaurant so ended up wandering into the cage next door. Much quieter than the main restaurant and lovely for a quick bite of breakfast. Excellent latte and quiche. Service was very friendly and welcoming. A little slow but didn't mind and gave me time to look at all the amazing cookbooks and specialty items."}
{"text":"I intended to come here for brunch, but I think I was a little late.  They gave me a lunch menu.  The complimentary was really good.  It was warm, buttery, and grilled.  I ordered the raspberries salad with Fossil Creek goat cheese.  I added some chicken for protein.  I also shared the BLT.  The sandwich was good.  The potato salad that came with the sandwich was yummy.  I couldn't resist ordering dessert so I ordered the key lime pie.  It was delicious!  It wasn't too sweet and the crust had toasted coconut flakes.  Overall, the food was fresh and of high quality.

Most of the patrons were woman.  I don't blame them.  I would be here on a Saturday morning shooting the breeze with my friends if I lived closer.  Arcadia Farms is really cute.  They have indoor and outdoor seating.  I wanted to sit outside under the covered patio, but it was all full.  I would like a similar place in CA."}
{"text":"No Pop! Champagne, but we did put down a bottle of a very tasty Zinfandel from Lodi, CA. 

Cheese plate... Yum.

I had the goat cheese salad. It was superb.

She had some kind of crepe. It was very yummy.

I didn't go inside once. I have too much testosterone. We sat out on the patio and it was very nice, even in the heat, due to the misters. That's kind of funny. The matrons of Scottsdale sit inside, away from the misters. 

Everything was fresh, tasty, well prepared, artfully plated, and the service was very good. Hard to go wrong! It's a great place for exquisite food and stimulating conversation, lubricated by a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"We liked it so much we ended up coming back for breakfast the next day too! Such a quaint, adorable farm-vibe restaurant in the middle of downtown Scottsdale. The food tasted exquisite and fresh. Our meal started off great because they brought out fresh, complimentary scones that just melted in your mouth - perfection. My mom and I split the breakfast sandwich and the french toast, it was definitely too much food but I couldn't decide and wanted to try both sweet and savory! I'm glad I did, both were excellent. The ciabatta was so fresh and the french toast's custard was scrumptious. Their marketplace was also super cute! We got a chocolate croissant to go and it held up until hours later (when I could actually eat again). Next time I want to try one of their salads!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for a while  and I finally made it . We went for breakfast on a nice sunny day and sat outside under the umbrellas. Our server was very pleasant. I ordered  the black bean ,avocado , goat cheese , omelette and my husband ordered the wild mushroom chives goat cheese omelette. Both were good . I would try something different next time & give this  place another try . The outside seating is the best thing about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Arcadia farms is an exquisite lunch or brunch spot. It's as cozy and elegant as can be. Perfect for a lunch out with the girls! Our group enjoyed the crab appetizers with gazpacho. I ordered the shrimp pesto salad with tortilla frizzles. Yum! I feared it would be super garlicky, but this dish was delicious and well balance. Pair that with their famous iced tea and you're all set! Their baked goods looked delicious too."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time two weeks ago and loved it.  Fresh food, neat ambiance, very well done overall.  Not the cheapest option for lunch, but healthy and fresh.  I tried their BLT with avocado and it was outstanding.  Once the weather cools down a bit I am going to head back here and try their patio - looked charming as well."}
{"text":"Love this adorable spot.  The marketplace is fantastic as an early morning for coffee and AMAZING pastry after a crisp morning walk.

The cafe for brunch or lunch is so quaint, it was just lovely!  Atmosphere is just completely adorable.

Food amazing.  I had the mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart. Absolutely perfect. My group also recommends quesadilla omelette and the crapes with ham and cheese with béchamel sauce.

Service was friendly, quick and professional."}
{"text":"The food quality is suspect. Disappointed they do not have coconut or almond milk, or stevie or another sugar/artificial sweetener healthy alternative. In my experience, when a restaurant doesn't have these simple healthy choices, they probably don't care about all of the ingredients in their food. Place is a nice atmosphere but for those who are meticulous about food choices and their health, buyer beware."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer practically since day one. Have always loved everything about Arcadia Farms but have noticed a slow decline over the past few years. Not as much attention to detail in the presentation. No more hot bread and butter served while waiting for your meal. Smaller portions. Food, always the consistent constant, not so much. 

Recently I took my 85-year old mother for lunch to commemorate what would have been my parents' 60th anniversary, as Arcadia Farms had been my mom's favorite restaurant for many years. We waited and waited. Once we ordered an appetizer, it came sailing out, followed literally a couple of minutes later by our entrees (my mom's crepes were burned and hard, and when I was sticking my fork into the bowl of shrimp salad, surprise, no bowl. It has been shrunk to the point that it is now served on a plate).  The waitress looked at us and said, oh, you're not ready, then plopped our meals on the table and fled. We did not see her again for half an hour after we had finished. We planned on dessert; Mom loves the coconut baby cake, but no server. We opted for ice cream on the way home. It will be a very long time before we return, if ever. Too many quality restaurants more deserving of our investment of time and especially of money. 

Sad to see the decline in what had been a favorite and favored restaurant."}
{"text":"A classic, gourmet breakfast/ lunch café that offers fresh, healthy dishes. Nice outside patio seating, leisurely services, and great coffee.

The café has the most \"beautiful\" crepe croquet-monsieur. The crepe was decorated with parsley, tomatoes, and creamy sauce. It looks like a blossoming flower from afar. And it tastes as good as it looks. Breakfast Quesadilla is stuffed with roasted zucchini, bell pepper, and corn. It is fresh but not super flavorful. I am not sure corn mixes well with zucchini and bell pepper.

Note: Reservations are essential for weekends. Also, may not be the first choice for carnivores and families with young kids."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal, we came here for brunch right when we landed and it was such a cute place! Julie was extremely welcoming and gave us free strawberry scones once we told her we were here for a bachelorette party. The scones just melted in our mouths and we were done with them in a few short minutes! We can't wait to come back next time we are in Scottsdale! We'll definitely be telling all of our friends and family to stop by Arcadia Farms when they are in town! Thanks Julie for your hospitality!!"}
{"text":"What a cute quiet little cafe. The patio is the perfect place to be on a warm day. I picked this place because of the brunch reviews on yelp and they did not disappoint. 

Before we even ordered they brought us bite sized scones that were to die for. They almost tasted like a biscuit but more flakey like a scone. Their mimosa menu has so many good juice selections. I had mango and it was delicious. My friends got strawberry and it was very refreshing. For food I had the Mushroom goat cheese omelet and my friend got the breakfast quesadilla. Both were delicious. The egg to mushroom and goat cheese ratio was perfect. The side of breakfast potatoes made it the quintessential breakfast plate. The breakfast quesadilla was packed with veggies and cheese. It came with a green and red salsa to add even more flavor. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Oh, love this place! Food and atmosphere are both fabulous! The only thing was, it was warm inside, wish they would have turned the air down a little. The dessert is incredible. You have to get the tuxedo cake!!"}
{"text":"We rented out the restaurant  for our rehearsal  dinner the night prior to  our wedding and it was unbelievable. Arcadia Farms cafe is not open for dinner but can be booked for  special  occasions. We had 40 guests for dinner. Food was amazing , service  was too, and the setting incredible ! If you are looking for elegance  and romantic  in a private setting for a special  occasion I highly recommend Arcadia  Farms Cafe ! All of our family and friends were so impressed as well as my wife and I ."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Sunday morning & decided to give it a try after we saw the reviews. The atmosphere is very \"Sunday brunch\" themed, so perfect for getting brunch/lunch and mimosas with the girls, or just going out for something nice on a weekend morning. We started off with the unsweetened peach tea, along with the Brie and strawberries & bread appetizer. He had the crab cakes, while I had the hot chicken sandwich with potato salad. The food here was AMAZING. Everything we had was full of flavor, the presentation was good, you can taste the freshness with every bite you had. It was exactly what we were looking for as far as wanting something light and healthy. For dessert, we had the chocolate raspberry baby cake, which was to die for! Overall, VERY good experience at this place, we will definitely be coming back here when we're back in town!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots in town! The food is fantastic and the service is great. The staff is extremely friendly and the decor is adorable and very inviting. I would suggest making a reservation if you can as they get pretty busy. The mushroom crepe and shrimp pesto salad are two of my favorite dishes. In addition, make sure you save room for dessert! The mini cakes are completely worth it."}
{"text":"It's 7:10 AM in the morning and they still haven't opened their doors. When the girl finally got off the phone and opened the door for business I asked her where the cookies were and she said that the main restaurant had special orders and they were not able to prepare them. When asked when will they be ready the girl replied \"in about two hours alright?\"

Actually no it's not alright and her attitude didn't help matters. Lame."}
{"text":"Mmmm... best Birthday Brunch ever!

Arcadia Farms is adorable.  Sitting on the front patio for Sunday Brunch I felt like I should be wearing some sort of hat and perhaps a floral dress.  No need - mimosas can be just as easily consumed in jeans!

Our server was fantastic - once determining that all four of us were having mimosas, she recommended getting a bottle of champagne & carafe of OJ as opposed to separate drinks - less expensive and more bubbly!  So, right off the bat I knew I liked her.  My esteem only grew when halfway through our meal the hostess accidentally removed our champagne bucket from the nearby empty table where we were keeping it.  Our server (gosh I wish I could remember her name!) chased it down and brought it back like a hero!  

OK, on to the food.  Shortly after we ordered, our rockstar server brought us a plate of complimentary strawberry scones, since she thought our food might be delayed since a party of 14 had just ordered.  Delicious!  It did not seem to me like our meals took a long time to arrive, either.  My friends enjoyed their entrees (French toast, black bean omlette and egg strada cobbler).  I loved mine too - I had the Crepes \"Croque-Monsieur\" (no, I can't pronounce that).  Crepes filled with ham & gruyere cheese and topped with bechamel sauce.  I prefer savory vs. sweet and these were spot on.

We finished our \"ladies who brunch\" experience with dessert - cute little cakes filled with rasberry and chocolate mousse.  

After all of that wonderful food, the rest of the day was kind of a blur...

Love, love, love Arcadia Farms and can't wait to go back.  This will be my new \"go to\" spot for out of town guests!"}
{"text":"This place is heavenly heaven..... just perfect not too much not tooo little. If u hate veggies, you should come and eat them here. They cooked fantastically..."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and ambiance. Very attentive wait staff. Excellent choice for great Scottsdale experience."}
{"text":"I just called and asked if all or some items on the menu is Organic (someone did a review saying it all is organic, but being that it's an allergy issue for me I thought I'd call) The fact that the worker had to put me on hold twice to ask (a second time once she understood the difference between organic and GF, vegan, etc) that alone should have told me the answer is no. If a restaurant is all about being organic, I would think the whole staff would be knowledgeable of that fact. 
But no, the only organic items are the greens on the menu- FYI for all ya'll"}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot in scottsdale! The atmosphere is wonderful, as is the food & service. I have never tried anything I didn't like. And their babycake desserts are fabulous! My personal favorite is the chocolate rasberry."}
{"text":"My original review was written just over a year ago, so when I was invited to a baby shower here today I was hoping I would have a better experience. 

I'll start by saying I added one star because it really is just a lovely place, it's too bad the food is so average, and that's being generous. 

I got an iced tea............So over brewed and way too strong, almost bitter. 

I ordered the Pesto Grilled Shrimp Salad (see pics) marinated and grilled shrimp, baby lettuces, diced avocado, baby tomatoes, goat cheese, grilled corn and lime vinaigrette topped with frizzled tortillas, sounds delicious no? 

No is right! Seriously the vinaigrette was all oil, no lime or acidity at all, there wasn't enough of anything on the salad to get a good bite of all the flavors bland as they were, and the fried tortilla strips were old and very greasy, really a $14 salad should be nothing less than divine. 

My daughter got the Albacore Tuna Salad Sandwich (see pics) $12 
albacore tuna, pecans, jicama, scallions, cucumbers and purple cabbage on sunflower , whole wheat bread with potato salad. 

Again sounds Delicious but was less than stellar. 

The Tuna mixture had a decent flavor but the tuna wasn't even mixed thoroughly, it was in large chunks straight from the can. 

The potato salads potatoes were barley done, almost crunchy and lacking any flavor that would make me want to continue eating nearly raw potatoes. 

The atmosphere isn't enough to intoxicate my senses into believing I'm eating something amazing. How unfortunate that so many can be blinded by a \"trend\" because the food is just not all that."}
{"text":"Food was decent but nothing to write home about. Service was pretty slow. I would go back only for the croissants."}
{"text":"A cute and cozy breakfast cafe in the Arts District of Scottsdale serving breakfast and lunch.

I really wanted to like this place -it's really cute and on a nice day it would be a great place to sit and chat and enjoy the many shaded outdoor spots.

Maybe it was the rainy morning but our experience was a bit underwhelming. We arrived at 8, just as they opened and were greeted and given our choice of tables as we were the days first customers.

TIP: essential to have a reservation here (which we did) as it got busier and busier and they turned lots of walk-ins away.

Saying service is leisurely is the most generous way I can describe our experience. Even though we were the first customers, our server didn't drop by for 5-10 minutes with greetings and water. Further, once we ordered, it was over 45 minute wait for the food-breakfast food-French toast and an egg sandwich.  So surprising since typically breakfast fare is the fastest and easiest to prepare.

Maybe they were short of staff or maybe it was just the rain. 4 star food with 2 star service and as I always say, good food is a given; service is what really sets a place apart.

Reluctantly, not recommended."}
{"text":"I ate here today and seven years ago. Here is a recap of both.

Seven years ago my friend had a bridal shower lunch here. We sat in the back of the restaurant. Food was unremarkable, service was decent except I specifically remember the waitress disappeared for long periods of time. The atmosphere was beautiful.

Today, the food was still unremarkable. What do I mean by that? I mean I ordered the salmon sandwich with fruit. It came missing the onion and arugula the menu said it came with. The mayo or aioli that comes \"on\" it was slopped on the side of the sandwich. (I don't care if it's a $3 sandwich or a $19 sandwich, I like when people take pride in their product and put the condiments where they belong) No fruit, and a side salad instead. I told the waitress right away that I would be OK with the salad, but I would need some dressing. Yes, the salad came completely dry. 

My grandmother asked for an extra side of poppyseed dressing for her salad, and the rest of us were finished with our meal by the time the extra dressing arrived. One time she tried to ask the waitress about it, but she didn't hear I guess because she just kept walking. We sat on the patio, again the atmosphere was beautiful! The patio was not very busy. Seven tables, we were one of three tables, a fourth had been sat by the end of our meal.

After lunch, I went to use the restroom to wash my hands before checking out the Marketplace next door. The bathroom needed serious attention. Empty toilet paper rolls, a GIANT turd floating in the toilet, awful odor, and the sink was very dirty. 

I might associate the stench and unremarkable food with the restaurant from now on. :-( 
I did the right thing, and let the hostess know so that someone could clean up the bathroom. 

Nextdoor is the Marketplace, and I purchased a baby carrotcake to take home to my husband."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good brunch place to meet our aunts while visiting from San Diego.  A friend suggested Arcadia Farms.  What a delightful place to spend time with friends.  The attention by staff was just right, and the food was just perfect.  We each enjoyed the tasty, fresh, well-presented dishes.  For locals and travelers alike, this is a stop worth making."}
{"text":"Always my go to for brunch or lunch with mom. There have been several newer quaint  farm to table type restaurant openings lately in the area but Arcadia Farms is a classic, they never disappoint. The food is delicious every time. The servers always have a smile on. The overall atmosphere is just lovely. If you are in the Old Town Scottsdale area looking for a special brunch or lunch spot this is it!"}
{"text":"This place is very cute, quaint, and homely. good place to take the mom out to eat or the inlaws. or your grandma. lots of old ladies. not exactly for a business meeting for the men, or anyone who is socially outcast, really.

i met one of my professors here for lunch and it was perfect..service was good, and i loved my mini bottle of korbel. ice cold water with lemon. she got a salad and i devored the tuna sandwich with potato salad. that potato salad was quite possibly the best potato salad i've ever had. big chunks of potato and not too overwhelming with the dressing. the tuna was fresh and not fishy, the veggies on it were crisp, and the bread was soft and mushy. mmmm."}
{"text":"I had such a great time at Arcadia Farms Cafe with my friends for a bridal luncheon! We walked through the cute little cafe and then into a building off the back patio for a private lunch. Our server was fantastic -- super fun and personable.
Between the 8 of us we ordered peach Bellini's, mimosa, and sangria with red. I couldn't really make out the peach flavor in my Bellini, but I've also never had one before so I'm not air what the standard is. The sangria was good (and quite large). 
We ordered and the food arrived promptly. I got the shrimp pesto salad and honestly wish I could eat it everyday! The shrimp was done perfectly, not at all rubbery and perfectly glazed with the pesto sauce. I should have asked what the dressing was because it complemented the person and goat cheese very well. I enjoyed the fresh corn that was on the salad, could have had a bit more. I'm not a huge tomato fan-but if you are they are plentiful on this salad.
Another dish I remember others getting and loving was the Mediterranean sandwich and the turkey and Brie sandwich (with fig jam and apples). 
We had a lovely time here-it's a great place to chat and enjoy yummy food!"}
{"text":"Super cute brunch spot with the girls!! The salmon was cooked to perfection. The cheese plate and the wine list looked incredible, would go back in a heartbeat!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Cozy. Warm. Friendly staff. The food is  great. Do you need more on a Sunday morning after a long hike? Don't think so."}
{"text":"Food was just ok for Saturday breakfast. Service was terrible and waitress a grumpy bi***"}
{"text":"Parking was unavailable due to valet blocking spots which is illegal.  Service was extremely slow.    Food has always been good enjoy the salads."}
{"text":"So I got the warm veggie salad ($14) and added shrimp ($5 extra). There were 4 medium-sized shrimp on it. Awful. I tried asking for more and they said no. This place seems very high-class and snobbish. Perhaps it was because I was wearing a T-shirt they sat us in the sun. If you don't mind paying a lot for mediocre food and enjoying a very snobbish atmosphere, this is your place!"}
{"text":"We came here to try their brunch, but unfortunately we got there a bit late and ended up having lunch there instead. 

I ordered their crab cake entree, which came with 2 small crab cake lumps and the rest of the plate was a salad. From the menu description and the price they charged, I would have expected more/larger crab cakes. This entree felt more like an appetizer portion but they charged lunch price for it. Despite this, it was actually pretty good, although I wouldn't order it for a lunch entree again. 

We were seated in their outdoors patio area. It would have been nice to enjoy a nice afternoon eating outdoors.  However, their patio was lined with large old trees hovering over most of the outdoor tables. In addition, there were many birds swooping in and out of those trees.  We had to be careful both of falling leaves/debris and bird poop the whole time."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  The chicken crepes were fantastic and I recommend the white sangria...  however, the service (or lack there of) was of the worst caliber I've encountered in Old Town Scottsdale. Polly, our server was very rude. We waited 15 min for water and another 25 for the bill.  She did fill our water ONE time, I'll give her that.  

Make reservations and plan on waiting!"}
{"text":"After lunching at Arcadia Farms, we decided to take a walk, as we heard the Marketplace where they sell their baked goods was not too far. Little did we know, all we had to do was cross the street!

Arcadia Farms Marketplace has several pre-made sandwiches and salads to choose from if you want to pick up a quick lunch. The case is full of some scrumptious looking baked goods, which I will definitely need to save room for next time!

We didn't buy anything this time, since we had just eaten, but what a convenient little place to pick up a quick yummy meal...and even better, most items are a few $$ less than on the menu across the street!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my mother-in-law and sister-in-law as the start to a girls' day out. I have been all over the Scottsdale scene, so it's a wonder it took me so long to get around to trying this place out. Let me begin by saying that this cafe is ADORABLE. I can't imagine a cuter lunch place if I tried and I'd come here again and again just for the sweet atmosphere. The service was quick and we were well attended to. My only qualm is that the menu is somewhat limited. There is a giant list of salads with an additional small list of meals that all included goat cheese or brie, which I am not fond of. In the end, I chose a strawberry salad. It was fine, but I don't really like salads, so for all I know it was the greatest salad ever and I just do not have the right palate to judge salads. But lucky for Arcadia Farms, the experience is more important to me than the food itself, and I had a great time. I will most likely return, as I am just totally in love with this beautiful little gem."}
{"text":"What a great luncheon date, bridal/baby shower, girlfriends-catching-up setting. I adore the patio, with its plush cushioned seats and even more so, the inside is adorable. We had just arrived in Scottsdale after a 22 hour trip and wanted somewhere to sit and relax for a little bit. We came upon Arcadia Farms and took our luck without a reservation. Luckily the hostess helped us out and as we weaved through the somewhat tight seating, I knew this was my kind of place. She led us out on to a back patio and in to another little seating area where there were women talking over glasses of white wine and amazing look lunch dishes. 

       We sat and were brought water and offered Apricot Iced Tea--of course I chose to try it, it sounded fantastic (and I wasn't disappointed). After looking over the menu (and having a hard time deciding) I chose to try the Pesto Shrimp Salad, while my mother got the Turkey and Brie sandwich. Both were phenomenal, the pesto and the shrimp were both spot on to make a simple salad more flavorful and exciting. It was a perfect light meal after a long, long car ride."}
{"text":"My 4 star rating is with a big fat juicy caveat... Let me start with the 'bad' part. 

To their GLUTEN FREE customers... BE VERY, VERY careful. We dined there with my sister today for lunch. She has ciliac and has to be very careful not to eat any gluten. Since this restaurant was highly ranked as gluten free-friendly, we decided to go. 

The menu clearly labels which items are GF. BUT the menu wasn't accurate... We were told by our server that some of the dishes have changed, and the menu hasn't been updated to reflect these changes. You must be careful to ask the server all the right questions to ensure your dish is truly GF. For example, one of the dishes is GF. Our server recommended it, saying it was tasty. When we asked her in detail what it was like, she ended her description with 'and only very lightly breaded' before frying. When we inquired about the breading, she said, \"it's not real bread... It's panko\". We felt embarrassed to explain to her that panko bread crumbs are real bread. Duh.

So she ordered the salad, which had raspberries, goat cheese, and grilled chicken. Looked delicious, and the menu said it's GF. She even asked that the candied pecans be left out, since we didn't get a good feel from her that she knew if the chef used flour or not (because some do). The salad arrived, and the goat cheese had a slight ... coating ... on it that caused us to be concerned. The server assured us it's grilled goat cheese and that the coating we saw was from the grill. We asked her to please double check and it turns out they use rice crispies to coat the cheese. Rice crispies??? I know there is GF rice crispies, but we doubt they're using it. We sent the entire salad back to be re-made, in case gluten crumbs remain on the rest of the food.

Enough with the bad. Let's do the 'good' part.

The food at this restaurant is simply amazing. Full of flavor, fresh as if you cooked it yourself, I would not hesitate to eat here again, sans my GF relatives and friends. I had the tuna sandwich for lunch, along with the potato salad. It was fantastic. One of us got the crabcake, and being originally from Baltimore, we know good crabs. This crabcake rivals those we would get back home. I had no room for dessert, but I definitely will come back and order dessert next time I'm there.

There's a large outdoor patio (front and rear), so dining al fresco is pretty easy. During the heat of the summer it might be a bit uncomfortable, but the rest of the year it's fantastic.

Bottom line: if you aren't concerned about your food content (vegan, GF, or vegetarian) then I highly recommend this place. If you go because they offer GF or any specialty diet-friendly food, then I warn you to exercise caution: know exactly what you can/can't have, and ask the server. If the server seems unsure, ask to speak to the chef or someone else in the know."}
{"text":"Hidden gem off tourist mosh track nearly a not to miss if you're into French pastries and the like. It was just what I needed to start the day right and ensure all meetings go as planned!  Everyone who works here is also amazinginly nice and that's not something I usually notice but here it stands out!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast on a Saturday.... service was extremely slow, as well as when we placed our order. Must of the tables were not cleaned...once we received our breakfast..it was okay. May have been just an off day."}
{"text":"what a wonderful thing our first option was crowded and my friend remembered this place. I It is a bit over my budget, but this was my birthday treat.

We tried 2 of the classic things they have. I had the fresh mushroom with goat cheese and keel and my friend had the chicken crepe. I found more taste and flavor on the first one, but in general both were really good. We finished with one of their deserts. The raspberry chocolate cake mmmmm or something like that. SHARE IT!! to eat one alone is too sinful.

The place has a nice decoration and makes you feel very comfortable. Great to surprise a girl or a boy :)."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was awful.  What a shame, I wish I could give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms is one of my favorite places for brunch.  Especially for getting together with the girls.  This is not to say it's a \"man-free zone,\" but, it is super cute.  It has a cozy English country garden kind of atmosphere inside, and on the patio.  Not only is the motif absolutely beautiful, but the food is super yummy too.  My personal favorite, from the lunch menu, is the Raspberry Salad with Fossil Creek Goat Cheese.  It's delicious and refreshing.  All I would add is that in my opinion, one goat cheese medallion is more than enough.  Thus far though I really haven't gone wrong ordering anything off their menu, it's all been wonderful.  

I definitely recommend this as an ideal place to relax, chat, and enjoy some delicious food."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum!  Outstanding service, fabulous ambiance, delicious homemade sangria, and even more delicious food.  We had the crepes, a fabulous greek salad, and the warm ham sandwich.  Everything was extremely fresh and tasty.  Then, for dessert, we took our server's recommendation and go the mini coconut cake.  We were so glad we did; it was so delicious and almost melted in your mouth.  We will absolutely be back and can't wait to take advantage of the patio when the weather cools down a bit."}
{"text":"I have wanted to visit Arcadia Farms since I moved to Scottsdale. I saved it for today as it was a special occasion after dress shopping for my wedding. It seemed like the perfect place to celebrate getting my wedding dress with my friend! I was thrilled to find out they had tables available and that the restaurant wasn't busy because I heard it could be on the weekend. We were seated after a few minutes and brought waters. I was offered a yummy sounding peach iced tea and was excited to order the caramelised onion cheese dip and sandwich. Unfortunately 25 minutes later I still did not have my tea and had yet to be able to order. I tried to flag down multiple waitresses with no luck. I was very hungry after not eating before my dress fitting and had seen our waitress wait on multiple other tables in our section. When we made the decision to leave to go eat somewhere else, the waitress offered to take our order. However, it was too little too late. We ended up lunching nearby and had a great time celebrating my wedding dress. I really wanted to love this place and make it somewhere I could take my mother, mother in law and sister when they visit. I will have to find a cute new girly lunch spot."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere. 

Everyone is dressed for a Sunday meal. Great for a family gathering. The pace is southern slow.  Perfect for relaxing brunch. 

Be prepared for a 2 hour sitting. 

The food is nice but not the reason to visit. The service is kind but paced.

A must if you need to shift gears to time gone by."}
{"text":"This venue works for me as it contains:

-Unique \"cottage\" type feel dining environment. During cooler months, you can dine al fresco under some shade trees/bushes, and then seperate dining \"rooms\" inside. Low ceilings w/antique-ey brick-a-brack/tchotchkes adourned on walls. Feel like I'm back eating in my Gramma Esther's kitchen. Ahhhhh :)

-Elborate menu choices at a nice number. I tend to get overwhelmed if menu offers too much. 

-Friendly service. Warm smiles were everywhere and frequent check-ins.

-Quality food. I tried Pesto Shrimp Salad and was satisfied; however, they could have upped the pesto on mine as it was a tad skimpy. Had a bite of the Mushroom Tart and it was DAMN good. Desserts looked tasty as well.

Areas of opportunity:

-Housekeeping. Big chunks of food found as I pulled my chair out to sit. That's just gross. It wld be very quick and easy to do a light sweeping as patrons left, IMO, being that they have wood floors.

-Follow through. Had to remind our Server 3x to split our bill 3 ways. Also, never did get my lemon wedges for my chemical-tasting water. Booo!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here and the menu. Have been here in the past and have always had a 5 star experience. However on this visit the service was substandard and the food was average. The service was extremely slow - almost like the kitchen staff didn't show up. Although the waitstaff was trying to keep us and the other customers happy, nothing can overcome a 1 1/2 hour wait for our food."}
{"text":"comfortable victorian garden oasis in the heart of Old Town, perfect for a Sunday brunch or a lady date with the girls"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to go for a leisurely brunch or lunch with friends.  I've heard some people say \"that's where chicks go\" ...well, I'd say cheers to that, I guess we have good taste :)  

This place offers some really great menu items for health conscious people, which I really appreciate.  Sometimes I don't want to go to breakfast because it's just too fattening, but this place makes delicious meals that don't force you to go to the gym right after.

Great coffees, teas, and breakfast cocktails are a great added offering, plus the baked goods are perfect for a little indulgence. (hey, if you save calories during the meal, you can afford to split a pastry!! ...yes, I'm a horrible dieter.)

Every dish I've tried here so far has been wonderful, I really don't think you can go wrong with your order.  Make sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is like an outdoor garden at someone's great-aunt's home in the Hamptons. We were seated immediately at a wrought-iron table outside under some misters and handed menus. It was a good 10 minutes before our server came out to take our beverage order and the only reason I stayed that long was because my escort excused himself to take a phone call. However, when our server did come by, she was super-nice. My Bee Eff had two eggs with bacon and I ordered some Frenchie-sounding crepe dish with ham and gruyere cheese, \"with a creamy bechamel sauce.\"
Another 10 minutes goes by before she drops off our iced tea and orange juice, which are served in those wine-looking water glasses with the stems, and they're both sucked down pretty fast. And then we've got two empty glasses on the table, and no one ever comes back to see if we need a refill. At this point I am periodically checking the time because hey, it's hot outside and we have nothing to drink, and our server is seemingly nowhere in sight! Several minutes pass before she drops off a carafe of iced tea and some waters. Another TWENTY minutes and our food comes out, his is missing toast and mine looks revolting. But I'm really into crepes and I'm pretty open-minded about food so I dive in. Another five minutes goes by before he gets his toast and is told that there is no tabasco sauce anywhere in the building, nor in the building across the street that servers have had to run to in order to get things that are obviously missing from the restaurant (it seems that the company owns both properties but you'd think they would keep all of their restaurant stuff in one convenient location...). 
My date's food was \"eh, no big deal. Eggs and bacon... you really can't screw that up.\" 
My crepes were the best part of the dish. They were the perfect consistency, thin, no lumps, no weird fried edges. I liked the CREPES. However... I was under the impression that the filling was to be ham and gruyere and it was ham lunchmeat only, not what I was expecting. The crepes were swimming in a watery, milky sauce that needed salt or some other seasoning (not quite the creamy bechamel I was expecting) and the gruyere was sprinkled across the top. So visually, if you can picture this: White cat vomit. But I was starving at that point and I liked the crepes part so I ate it. 
And then I wanted to pay and leave. And we couldn't even do that because like the entire experience thus far: no server to be found. Don't get me wrong, I didn't dislike her. I mean, when she did come around, she was one of the nicest servers I've ever had. She was just inattentive to her tables on the front patio. Getting the check took another fifteen and then I was ready to pay and it took so much longer waiting for no one to come back that it got to the point where I had to get up, go inside and stand in the kitchen while someone else rang me up. 

Bottom line: Mediocre, overpriced food ($40 for two small breakfasts and no booze), shit service. Not going back."}
{"text":"I work by Old Town and I have been on the hunt for a new regular lunch joint ever since the owner at my favorite place told me he doesn't hire women because \"they aren't hard workers\" (yeah, wtf - so I never went back.) A few weeks went by of horrible Chipotle and the occasional desperate drive to far away places like LGO and Pane Bianco. Finally I heard about Arcadia Farms Marketplace, looked up the menu online, and drove over immediately. They have a good assortment of breakfast items, and for lunch there is soup, salad, and sandwiches. Salads are pre-made to go, sandwiches you have to wait for them to make.

Sandwiches. I've been here three times so far (just this week, oops), and have tried three different sandwiches. The first, and my favorite was the mozzarella, tomato, basil sandwich. It's served on focaccia and the ingredients are super fresh and flavorful. In my opinion they overdo it on the mozz, so I removed about half, no biggie. Yesterday I had the curry chicken salad sandwich. Served on a really hearty multi-grain bread that was tasty and satisfying. The chicken salad itself was just meh for me. Just way too many raisins. I removed at least 20 and still managed to eat more than that. Probably wouldn't order it again since I don't mind raisins but this was overkill.

Today I went for the Smoked turkey and brie. This was really good too.. Although the description said it has cranberry mayo, mine had some sort of gelatinous fruit spread instead. Whatever, it was good. The walnut bread it comes on is awesome. Yum.

I love that they have more than one vegetarian sandwich option on the menu! I will be trying the Roasted Artichoke and Ricotta sandwich next. I tried to order the Pressed Chicken sandwich without bacon today, but they informed me the bacon is already mixed in with the other ingredients. What a bummer for those of us who don't eat pork. 

Drinks. I like the iced tea. They said it was mango but I couldn't really tell. I'm not much of a tea connoisseur so who knows. Today I got an Arnold Palmer thinking it would be sweeter than the tea but it really wasn't much of a difference. Also the menu shows an AP costs $3 when a reg iced tea or lemonade are only $2.50. Doesn't make much sense if you're just using half of each. But anyway she charged me $2.50 so maybe they realize the menu is wrong.

Baked goods. Extremely tempting spread! Brownies, cookies, muffins, scones, cupcakes, dessert breads, savory breads, macaroons, mini cakes, and more. All but the mini cakes are priced $2.50-$3 and are ginormous, so perfect to share. I've tried the macaroon - which was the size of a damn tennis ball! - it's like a meal in itself. I also tried a bite of my coworker's magic bar or whatever you call that thing with the coconut, chocolate, nuts, etc. It was pure sin. 

Shop. They sell all kinds of kitchen items, and you could easily whip up a cute housewarming or other last minute gift. There are platters, cutting boards, ceramic items and more. Currently there is no seating inside, only on the patio, so that could prove to be an issue when we hit the hottest months. There are about 5 parking spots dedicated to the Marketplace on the east side, just ignore the valet only signs. 

Service. There have been only two employees working on all my visits. One in the kitchen and one at the counter. They are quick and friendly and knowledgeable about the ingredients when I've had questions. 

Overall I am really pleased and will be returning often. I will update my review when I have worked my way through some of the salads and soups!"}
{"text":"First of all I've come here many times !! I enjoy the ambiance and goat cheese appetizers love their desserts !! What I don't love is the slooow service !!
Don't come starving because you will wait to get your food a very long time plus even getting a table takes a looong time even when there's tons of tables open ! It always feels like the place is short staffed . Again I will still return just wish it wasn't so slow ."}
{"text":"One of our very favorite places in Scottsdale. Consistently clean, fresh, inviting. Love the coconut baby cake, the Brie with caramel apples, the crab tower and so much more!"}
{"text":"Charming, comfortable atmosphere; accommodated dietary concerns with good food."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Food is amazing and the grounds are beautiful. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients. Phenomenal bread. I had a tuna sandwich. It was good - I am no chef, but I watch a lot of chopped so I think I am pretty qualified to make the claim that the tuna could have used some sort of pickled flavor like relish. The bread though. I can't get over it! Baked nice and evenly. Top notch. This is a place where socialites sit and eat for 2 hours, so bring your red hat. Jk- u should probably call ahead though to avoid the tourists."}
{"text":"Of all the places I've eaten in the valley this is the loveliest.  Perfect place perfect service and the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Alex A. and I wanted to try one of the fancy restaurants in Scottsdale and I picked Arcadia Farms because it seemed like the perfect place for a quaint little Sunday lunch. The fact that it was raining didn't detract from the cuteness of this place. It's nestled away from the hustle and bustle of Scottsdale Rd. but still close enough to walk to the Artwalk and have an overall enjoyable afternoon. The restaurant is very cottage-like, with small separate rooms. The space felt a little bit tight at times, especially at the entrance. But it has that very homey sort of feel. 

First thing I noticed was that the crowd here was generally older. It seemed like a big gathering of knitting circles or book clubs. But the food was by no means out-dated. It wasn't trendy nor very traditional - just very normal. 

Our service wasn't amazing, but it was okay. Our food came very quickly, which was a nice surprise. I really enjoyed the garlic bread that they served at the beginning, and I'm not even a fan of garlic bread. Our first batch was cold, though.

We ordered the Arcadia Greek Salad and the California Club Sandwich with the split pea soup. It was nice and well-proportioned, but again, I didn't think it was blow-my-mind amazing. The hummus that came with the Greek Salad was pretty exceptional, and I gobbled that right up. But everything else was...meh.

I'd come for the dining atmosphere. Too bad it was raining today, but I imagine that outside garden/patio area would be very nice to dine in. I didn't care that much about the food, though. The prices were normal (about $12 to $16/plate), and the presentation was very appetizing, but nothing we ordered was very great. Maybe we didn't order the right things, but I don't think I'd be coming back to try other stuff very soon."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst restaurant I have been in Tempe area. The lemonade tastes awful... it smells like they never wash their glass. After i complained about the lemonade, they still charge me for the lemonade. I think it is ridiculous. The waitress forgets my starters. And she didn't come to our table to ask our orders. So I have to call someone else to order the dessert and then I miss the coconut baby cake( which is the reason why I want to try this restaurant at first). They have sold out the coconut cake when I order even the table next to me ordered 4 coconut cake only 5minutes earlier. And the chocolate baby cake don't taste good at all. Ice tea and wild mushroom crepe tastes good. But this doesn't provide me enough motivation to come again. Bad experience."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! They have many great and healthy breakfast/brunch and lunch options. We came for lunch and I got the turkey and brie sandwich with a side salad and it was excellent! The portions are a nice size and the desserts are very rich.
Wonderful atmosphere. 
It was hard to find parking during lunch time, but right across the street from Arcadia Farms is a valet service."}
{"text":"Met my mother here for a weekday lunch. We had to wait to be seated on the patio, but well worth it. The waitstaff is very professional, and the surroundings are so peaceful, making our meal very pleasant. Food was delicious. I ordered the chicken cobb salad. No rolls or bread were offered with it though. If I had a magic wand, I would create more parking. Having to valet park for a 1 hour meal on a Tuesday, or walk 2 blocks, seems unfair. If you are not in a hurry, and the weather is glorious, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Just came from lunch this afternoon after receiving horrible service. And they weren't even busy! My girlfriend and I met at 11 a.m. to avoid the big lunch crowd as we both work and needed to get in and out.  We were seated promptly and our server took our order, but it took over 25 minutes to get two salads!  Didn't see our server again for another 15 minutes.  My girlfriend didn't finish her salad and was going to take it home.  When our server finally showed up to the table next to us, I asked for our check as we were running late (by now it was 11:55) Apparently when I was looking down to get my credit card, someone took both plates without asking if we wanted a box to go.  It was clear the plate was 3/4 full of salad and any server would ask if we wanted it to go.   When I asked our server what happened to our plates she was clueless!  Even though the food is good, the service should equally be as good.  Not sure I will return."}
{"text":"Cute place. Nice ambiance. Great food, wonderful desserts. I had the crab cakes, the y were delightful, laid upon a bed of Greens. A lovely key lime tart desert! The market place next door has their salads and deserts as well. I went in for some take home deserts and found it was happy hour, half off! Score! 

Definitely would go again, great place for the ladies to gather and chat!!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, we showed up here about 0745 on a weekend morning and not a soul in sight. This was after bypassing the Daily Dose due to the crowd waiting for a table. For a second choice, I think we won. The breakfast here was A-1. Service was great. We sat outside ( I want to revisit this later), the decor is great, outside seating front and back. Now, the brunch is served acorss the street later in the day. We had the cafe breakfast. My co-pilot and I got some peach mimosas (not too many) and Egg Strada Cobbler (Cheddar over eggs with roasted vegetables, creme freche, and this very lean sausage). We also had the mushroom leek quiche, which was this awesome pastry shell with pungent veggies and spinach. Both very filling, The fresh fruit was awesome. So, no complaints on the food, service, anything. Why no 5 stars? You ask. WELLLLLL, that lush greenery on the patio comes along with it's share of lurking predators, known on the East Coast as the \"skeeter\". We were eaten whilst we ate and left there covered with mosquito bites. I am not talking a few. I am talking 10-20 bites each on our legs. And the Arcadia Farm mosquito is not a weak one, it is a flesh-swallowing mutant...so- spray with OFF! if you're going to sit outside. Don't say I didn't warn you,. THE FOOD, THOUGH IS WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 3 for brunch and were told to stand outside in the heat while they seated people behind us without reservations.  There were many empty tables that would have accommodated us but they chose to seat others.  We were eventually walked through the patio to a back low-ceiling, paneled, enclosed shed-type building with no air circulation and zero charm.  On our way out, we saw the 4-top tables had been seated with customers.  I wonder why we couldn't have been seated in the main restaurant? Very unhappy with the experience.  The food didn't justify tolerating that kind of treatment."}
{"text":"Showed up with a reservation, and was told they're very busy,  and we could be added to the waitlist, despite our reservation. Told it would be at least 20 minutes. Totally unacceptable to have a restaurant so poorly run."}
{"text":"I had a fabulous lunch here. The food, service, drinks, and location are all top notch.  I think the warm vegetable and chicken salad is the best salad in town.  We were a little early for lunch and the waitress took good care of us with sparkling wine while the kitchen prepped for lunch instead of imposing the breakfast menu on us.  Additionally, the location is charming and convenient."}
{"text":"Went from brunch on Saturday.  Our server was really friendly. Food was local and fresh.  We got a great seat at the front.  Food came out pretty quickly

We tried the Crepe Croque-Monsieur, 2 farm egg whites and fresh fruit.  The Bechamel sauces on the croque-monsieur was particularly good."}
{"text":"Great location and I love that they're patio is shaded (hello, we DO live in Arizona - other restaurants follow their lead please ;)  the decor is eclectic and waitresses are very friendly and service is quick and efficient. 

I ordered the mushroom crepes and they were amazing- the food is portioned perfectly there's no over eating. 

Go and check this cafe/bistro out!"}
{"text":"Lunch was salmon with some (cold) roasted potatoes and spinach that was sour--however, overall, it was decent.  
This is a cute place, sort of a \"gals lunch\" type place for me and my girlfriends and their moms, but nothing super special.
Parking is $3 plus tip, so figure on that.
Overall, ok...nothing fantastic--just okay."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and this was one of my worst experiences. Upon entering the restaurant my friend and I could visibly see the manager freaking out that multiple parties walked in in a row. We even over heard her say, \"well we are just going to seat them over there and that's how it's gonna be, these servers are going to kill me.\" That is not a great way to walk into a restaurant. Then we sat on the patio and were getting drenched by the misters. We asked to have them turned off and they did for a brief moment and turned them back on. Our service was lacking to say the least. My breakfast panini came and it is not a panini at all, it should just be called a breakfast sand which, it's not pressed served on ciabatta and pretty dry. The only reason I'm giving it 3 starts is for the coconut cake, it's amazing and I would return for just that. 
Overall food and service is sub par and it's a little over priced for what you get!"}
{"text":"Service= Fantastic 
Atmosphere = Amazing
Disappointed because we got there a little after 12 pm and only lunch was served. 
Split the crab tower and it tasted like tuna. Also split the chicken sandwich, not impressed. Will go back MAYBE to try breakfast... but had high hopes and very let down"}
{"text":"Has a very upscale feel, tried the crepe, its very flavorful but it feels like it's missing something for me.  Maybe because I'm a guy and the portion isn't so big.   Probably cater to females"}
{"text":"We came for Sunday brunch and were impressed by the food! Service wasn't great... even though there were some empty tables. Everyone was friendly and our food came out just as ordered... server just wasn't very attentive. The mushroom omelette was amazing- goat cheese and wild mushrooms were so good. The panini was also good- delicious bread. They have several different bubbly brunch drinks- I got the raspberry which wasn't necessarily cheap ($8) but very good."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms is a lovely place to take moms and girlfriends for a super cute brunch in Phoenix's amazing January weather.

The restaurant has ample seating, both indoor and outdoor, but it might be a good idea to make reservations as it seemed pretty busy on a Friday afternoon...I can only imagine the weekends!

I had the mediterranean melt, which was an assortment of grilled veggies and melted mozzarella sandwiched in between pesto and ciabatta bread with a side of spring greens. I'm typically not a big fan of ciabatta, but in this situation, it complemented the veggies very well. My girlfriend got the chicken quesadilla, which was probably the fanciest queso I've ever seen in my life. Both were plated nicely and tasted as fresh and good as it looked.

Yes, it is on the more pricey side, as each entree ranges from $12-20 but I'd come here again considering the options for cute brunch joints are disappointingly miniscule."}
{"text":"Special. Not on menu. Chicken strawberry raspberry blackberry blueberry goat cheese salad with raspberry vinagerette. This was THE best salad I've ever had, and probably top 5 best meals in my life."}
{"text":"Once again eating on the go in between meetings, so grabbed a pre-made sandwich from the Arcadia Farms Market counter across street from cafe.  The Turkey and Brie sandwich with Fig Jam sounded amazing and I was also tempted into one of the lemon bars from the case.  My mouth was watering in anticipation of what I was expecting to be a fabulous gourmet lunch in the middle of my hectic day...that is until I watched the friendly girl behind the counter pull my lemon bar with her bare hand!  Admittedly, I'm a bit of a germaphobe, so not trying to be overly dramatic here, but really?  I think tongs or even a piece of wax paper are appropriate; especially for this trendy, high-end establishment.  Changing money and then directly handling food is just gross.  My Turkey & Brie sandwich was ok, but next time I would ask for a side of the fig jam, as I could not taste it at all.  The Arcadia Farms experience fell short today, but I still plan to come back and dine with girlfriends in the Cafe."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms is one of my favorite places to chat, gab and grub with good girlfriends :)

The restaurant atmosphere is similar to a ladies tea room, all warm and cozy on the inside, with a beautiful patio out back.  I personally prefer to sit out back and enjoy the lovely AZ weather, but everyone has their own preference, so either way you will not be disappointed.  

Same goes for the food; every dish is like a warm embrace. Comforting, warm and so delicious that you cannot help but smile as it consumes your taste buds.  I have yet to eat anything that I have not wanted to order again.  My favorite dishes are the egg strata (breakfast), and warm vegetable salad with chicken (lunch).  The strata looks almost like a bread pudding, but is filled with eggs, cheddar cheese, roasted veggies, and sausage. Holy yum!

Double bonus for having 3 different mimosa options (orange, raspberry, or peach) and fresh baked goods!  I highly recommend dining at Arcadia Farms for a relaxing, comforting day out :)"}
{"text":"My family and I were excited to dine here. We arrived at 11am, was not offered water or acknowledged for 15 minutes. They eventually took our order at 11:26 and one dish arrived at 11:40 and they forget my daughter's sandwich. The wrong sandwich arrived 6 minutes later without an apology and we asked for boxes and the check. In the meantime, the two tables next to us were both complaining about not getting service. We have yet to eat our food since it was boxed up. We will never go again nor recommend it."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and design.  Unfortunately the food doesn't keep up with the ambiance.  Prices were high for pre-made food.  Throw a chef in here and it could be an amazing spot."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Our server, Julia, was exceptional! She took great pics of our group and was extremely personable. I love  lunch at this restaurant. It is my restaurant to take friends and family."}
{"text":"What moves me out of hiatus?  A surprisingly bad expereince at Arcadia.  Terrible.

To be fair, I've eaten here many times before and have had great experiences and find the food delicious.  

This past Sunday was a very different story.  Six girlfreinds and I came for brunch and were deciding our meals.  However one of the girls wanted to order from the lunch menu rather than the breakfast menu. We were told that this was possible at 11 am.  Julia, our sweet waitress, informed us that due to the kitchen size those who wanted breakfast had to first place their orders. Then at 11 am, the kitchen would switch out and she could take the lunch order. She was quite clear that the lunch entree would be 5-10 minutes after our breakfasts came out.  My friend didn't mind at all.  

What transpired was not okay.

Our breakfasts come out. WE sit and wait 5-10 minutes for her lunch. Nothing comes out so we all eat in front of her. Eh, she thought it was coming out soon.  NOt so much.

Long story short, we waited AN HOUR for her food.  No joke, we all ate, I ordered  second drink, we sat and chatted and still nothing.  OUr waitress was very sweet and you could tell she was embarassed at the time it was taking. WAsn't her fault.  She even brought scones out for my freind to nibble on.

An hour later she decided she wasn't waiting any longer for a SANDWICH. A VEGGIE sandwich at that.  You grill some veggies and slap it on bread.  An hour?  No.

The manager comes out,the waitress must have told him how ridiuclous it was, and offers to give her the sandwich for free.  She stated that was fine, but that she didn't want to sit any longer, if it came out by the time we paid, then great.  

What struck me as funny was, they still charged her for hte one drink. Seriously, it took an HOUR for a veggie sandwich and they made her pay for her one mimosa.

The waitress was fantastic and very sympathetic to the ridiculousness, but I'd only give them one more chance."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!! I called several weeks ago to make a reservation for Mother's Day. I was put on hold for several minutes. The woman eventually told me that she would take my number and call me back. She didn't. I called back a couple days later to be told that I would have to be put on a list because I had a party of more than 5. She proceeded to tell me that I would get a call in about a week letting me know if I would get the reservation or not. Two days before Mother's Day and still no call!"}
{"text":"Adorable, fresh food, and fun cottage restaurant!

Pros:
-Fresh salads! 
I've gotten both the Strawberry Chicken Salad which was divine and the Salmon \"Super\" Salad which had all the right tastes but the salmon was a bit too fishy. Next time, I'd sub chicken because the farro, greens, chickpeas, and wonderful, lemony tarragon dressing was a great mix!
-DELICIOUS cakes! Moist, fresh, and amazing frosting!

Cons:
-Salmon too fishy (it is AZ after all though, no water for a ways)
-Expensive"}

The quaint little cafe vibes make for an impeccable experience! The food is FRESH and delicious! The staff is friendly and welcoming, highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the very best restaurants in the Valley of the Sun.  The only bad thing I can say is that I wish they were open for dinner!  We rearranged our schedules just to be able to dine here...and were absolutely thrilled!  Make a reservation if you can (even if only a few minutes out) to be assured of a table!  Service is top shelf and speedy too!  The menu offers lots of choices and I ordered the crepes. Soooo good, I almost found myself licking the plate!  My husband ordered the club sandwich and it was 5-star as well.  Make sure to save room for the Baby Cakes!  We split a coconut baby cake....and seriously...I could have eaten one all by myself it was so good.  The White Sangria is a delicious addition to any meal.  Definitely going to make this a re-visit next month when the girls descend on Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food. Great service. Very nice atmosphere. This is exactly what we were looking for. We will put this on our list of favorite places!"}
{"text":"Food is DELICIOUS...service SUX(w were a party of 4 and it took 35 minutes for a server to come to our table)....today it was 93 outside...all the window and doors were open and the restaurant was HOT as hell(felt like fainting in there)...was NOT a great experience to say the least(and I have always LOVED this restaurant for years)"}
{"text":"We recently enjoyed a delicious lunch at Arcadia Farms cafe at the Phoenix Art Museum.  The leek/mushroom/goat cheese tart I had was delicious.  Similar to a quiche, but so much better, good-sized, and having a flaky crust, the tart was served with a nice salad of greens and tomatoes.  Coffee was excellent and the service too!  

The dining experience had one down side and that was the noise level - it was so loud that it was difficult to converse.  Just sitting through the din was an ordeal.  The Cezanne show had just opened so the dining room was very full.  The quality of the food made it a worthwhile visit though!"}
{"text":"All I can say about Arcadia Farms is AMAZING!!!

The experience starts as soon as you reach the front patio area. As soon as I looked around the patio, I knew it would be amazing. Everything about the decor is charming, as in Emily Post style charming not at all cute-sie. The staff is awesome-warm & friendly but not intrusive. But what would an amazing environment be without equally amazing food? The food at Arcadia Farms is just as wonderful as the aura. First, all the food is fresh, locally grown food & it tastes that way. If you are there for breakfast, I highly recommend the Breakfast Panini. I am a huge breakfast person & breakfast doesn't get much better than the Breakfast Panini. For lunch, I like the Mediterranean Melt. The roasted veggies in the Mediterranean Melt really highlight the freshness & flavor of the ingredients being used. 

To sum it up-Arcadia Farms is faboo. (At least in my book.)"}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms was great for breakfast. The staff were friendly and attentive. My husband and I had omelettes with potatoes and they were both very good. We were served homemade scones prior to our meal and those were delicious! It's a very cute place and we really enjoyed the ambiance there."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! 
It's not only beautiful but very welcoming. 
The food is really good! 
 Don't miss out on this address ;)"}
{"text":"My friends and I went for an early Sunday brunch here. The hostess asked if we had a reservation, \"no\", to which she said it was recommended. The restaurant was half empty.
The strawberry scones were a nice touch. Wish they had a larger coffee selection. 
I am rating two stars for service. We waited a very very long time for ordering, getting drinks, getting food and getting the check. I am fairly certain our waitress had some issues one of them being telling us an awful story about another guest. Rule #1 of customer service, don't talk about other customers! 
The food came out lukewarm and it was ok. I had a goat cheese and mushroom omelet
. I am surprised this place remains a hot spot for \"ladies who lunch\" when there are much better offerings elsewhere."}
{"text":"The best time to come here is before 10am on the weekdays, otherwise parking starts to get a little tricky.

This place is nice and elegant for a breakfast joint.  Water is served in wine glasses, complimentary scone at the end of your meal, and the outdoor seating is pleasant.  I had their seasonal fruit plate (which seemed fresh and was not mostly grapes like some fruit plates), and baby spinach and tomato omelette with goat cheese instead of feta.

The tomatoes were sliced cherry tomatoes instead larger diced ones, and it came with (I'm assuming) fingerling potatoes with some sort of weird spice.  It was probably paprika, but I was too underwhelmed by the choice of potato to really look into it.  Fingerlings are good, but probably too fancy for breakfast.  That being said, it's still one of my favourite places for breakfast.

I haven't tried the market part of the establishment, so no reviews there.  Yet."}
{"text":"Sometimes when I'm at work and I get overloaded, I go into old-people f*#k mode, ie; any way to get the job done.

I suspect that's how the chef functions at AF when the place is packed to the gunwales because my herb roasted chicken sandwich, a long standing favorite of mine became my least favorite...all in the space of one visit.

I've rarely had a bad meal here, but Saturday, the place hosted every old woman's birthday, baby shower, and all-around chick event. I think the kitchen panicked and started throwing shit on plates like monkeys were ruling the kitchen.

Anyway, it wasn't good.
Come here when it's not so packed and you don't have to listen to the gay couple next to you bragging about their trip to Barbados and how they frolicked nude on the beach.
The image of swinging dicks combined with a bad sandwich was over the top.
Glad I have a Xanax prescription."}
{"text":"For as many years as they have had their doors open, Arcadia Farms Cafe sustains all the elements of great dining.  Ambiance is lovely, the quality and presentation of the food is pleasant, and the service is very nice.  It is also fun to be able to leave with a box of freshly baked pastries to bring home or take to a friend as a special treat.  The raspberry scones are sheer perfection."}
{"text":"Have dined here on a couple of occasions now and enjoyed every time. Although they were almost completely out of wine ..... I guess they can be forgiven as it was the Walkabout event today... I was still able to get some Pinot Grigio and my Husband was able to get one of the last three desserts! Lucky man : )

Can recommend the Tuna Sandwich with pecans and diced jicama...this was very nice with a side of the white bean salad. The highlight of this meal was definitely the roasted chicken, leek and mushroom crepes in a creamy basil sauce! Wow!

The staff here are always great.....fast, friendly service. The tables by the windows are nice and you are also able to eat at the bar which is cool too."}
{"text":"Yet another great experience.......though all credit must be given to Yelp....otherwise would never find some of these places.

Can recommend the following:

Warm Sonoma Goat Cheese Salad with fresh Raspberries - organically grown baby lettuce , goat cheese medallions, jicama, carrots, fresh raspberries and candied pecans with their home made raspberry vinaigrette....the pecans are truly delicious!

Short Rib Quesadilla - A special of the day.....very delicious.

Home made lemonade - very refreshing

On the way out the smell of coffee and the view of the double chocolate cookies was too much so ordered to go......very, very good coffee and the cookie tasted like a chocolate brownie.....very moist and absolutely mouth watering......

There are many choices for seating....front patio, side patio, back patio and of course inside...all seating options have a great cozy feel....doubt you could pick a bad spot.

Staff are also awesome."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a new place for lunch today before we go back to Montana! Well, we hit a jackpot with Arcadia Farms! Super food and menu! Everything was so fresh and you try the Tuxedo cake! Awesome place!!"}
{"text":"Overall I can't say I am really impressed. The pastries were the highlight of our breakfast but were something you could get elsewhere. I ordered an omelet and the best I can say is that it was average. It was actually a bit watery and the potatoes were really disappointing. While the food was average (same with the coffee) the real issue is attempting to avoid the non stop bombardment of birds while you wait (for some time too) for your meal.

Compared to other spots in the area such as US egg I wasn't overly impressed.

Our waitress was very nice overall so no complaints in that department."}
{"text":"Good food, ample seating. Almond pastry is amazing! Server was really friendly, but super busy. Def a great spot for many different brunch options."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a cute little house turned into a restaurant with the vibe of my grandmother's house growing up based on decorations. We sat on the patio outside to get some fresh air. The peach tea was really delicious. I had the pesto grilled shrimp salad and my mom had the turkey and brie sandwich. We both really enjoyed our food, but my salad was mostly lettuce. There wasn't a lot of shrimp or toppings so for a $15 price point you would expect more protein. Our waitress was friendly, however you could tell she was very distracted. We could overhear the table next to us complaining several times about their food. They were quite rude about it and I felt bad for the waitress, but she allowed it to impact how she served other tables."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place (for both the people watching and the food) so when a friend of mine suggested we meet here for lunch while I was in Scottsdale visiting I was all for it. 

Unfortunately my friend had to meet early so the place was pretty empty when we were here. I say \"unfortunately\" because we missed out on the show...that is we missed out on watching the \"ladies who lunch\" like it's there job in action. Oh well, at least we had free reign on where to sit, so we got a nice spot on the patio. 

The menu is pretty much salads, sandwiches, soups, and a few other similar items. I decided to go with a California club, which was pretty delicious. I got it with potato salad, which was pretty yummy as well. Everything tasted fresh. The one slight complaint that I had was that the potatoes in the potato salad were undercooked. However, it had bacon it it so I can't complain, and actually when I had my leftovers a few hours later the potatoes weren't as hard so it's all good. 

My friend and I also split some bread pudding for dessert which was beyond delicious! It was moist and had raspberries in it! I was actually surprised by how big the portions were (for both the dessert and the entrees...my friend got a salad which was pretty big as well). I just didn't expect that from this kind of place. It's a little pricey, but for what you get I think it's worth it. 

I'll be back at Arcadia Farms when visiting Scottsdale, but when I do I wanna come by when it's a little more crowded to watch the show (and possibly even join in!)."}
{"text":"Came in Tuesday morning, it was quite a cute place. First time here and I was a big fan. My server Polly was a sweetheart and made me feel right at home. Big kudos. Love to feel welcomed especially for a first time! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"4.5-5 stars

Quaint cafe with a very homey feel. The service was good and the food was very fresh. It doesn't seem like you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Definitely a great place to grab a bite and chat with your girlfriends or an afternoon date spot with your significant other.

1) Signature Strawberry Chicken Salad (with Grilled Chicken, Vine-Ripened Strawberries, Mixed Baby Greens, Toasted Almonds and Poppyseed Vinaigrette)
2) Mediterranean Melt (with Roasted Seasonal Vegetables, Smoked Mozzarella Cheese and Basil Pesto on Warm Ciabatta) with a side of potato salad.

The service was decent, the food was amazing. I wouldn't mind going back again!"}
{"text":"It is a perfectly lovely spot for a break from art musing. The food is tasty but clearly pre-made and that is a little off setting. Overall it is a unique combination of high style cafeteria with a wine bar. You don't think leek and spinach tart prepared by a cafeteria. On the other hand,  you do recognize your tart was run thru a broiler as a pre-made frozen variety before it arrives at your table. I would go so far as to say because it is Arcadia Farms you expect super fresh food and instead you get super fresh pre-prepared food. This is the 3 star quagmire...did I like it, yes, would I go again, only if  I was really hungry and didn't know that there were a ton of eclectic restaurants whipping up great food blocks from here...but if I was really jonesing for a drink while art browsing - nothing would stop me from plunking down for a glass!"}
{"text":"This is the most adorable place to get breakfast, brunch or lunch. The patio is gorgeous and it's equally as charming inside.

The menu offers all your typical fare- omelets and pastries in the morning, sandwiches and salads in the afternoon. The pastries looked and tasted delectable. Our complimentary berry scones were buttery, dense with the perfect amount of tenderness. For my entree I chose the wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart. It was a sizable portion, served with seasoned potatoes and fresh fruit. The tart itself was a punch of flavors and textures. I gobbled it right up along with those potatoes and fruit! I liked all the components of the tart, from the flaky buttery crust, the different cheeses, and the earthy flavor of the mushrooms and spinach. The potatoes were well seasoned and soft and the fresh fruit consisted of pineapple and strawberry.

If you dine outside it's cute to see all the sparrows perching and flitting around your table. I think they are really keeping their beady little eyes on any leftover plates or scones though! 

Service was decent. Drinks were refilled as needed. 

The tart was $12 which I thought was reasonable given the quality and size of my dish. 

The only real negatives I could find were that some of the outdoor patio cushions for the chairs looked like they could use a good cleaning. There's also a small parking lot at the Marketplace but chances are you'll be parking on the street. Spots can get filled up if there's an event going on, plus the general fact it's in downtown Scottsdale.

I did spy a sign that said they offer afternoon tea on the weekdays too so I may have to come back and try that out sometime!"}
{"text":"This place is filled with the Housewives of Scottsdale during lunch.  Considering it was a random week day that I went to eat lunch/ brunch here, the tables were quickly getting filled with ladies chattering away...
I liked the back patio dining area, it was filled with greenery and flowers through out the back area.  

I had the following AF Classics:

Chicken, leek, and wild mushroom crepes: the crepes were filled with a savory cream sauce that wasn't too overbearing with the creamy texture.  What I liked about this dish was the abundant amount of fresh sliced pieces of chicken and bits of mushroom that didn't have a salty aftertaste.

Wild mushroom, spinach, and goat cheese tart:  you have to have acquired taste for any dish that has goat cheese, and this dish had just the right amount in which it wasn't salty nor too creamy that it feels like cheese cake.  The tart was baked in a golden brown, but not too well done. 

My friend and I ordered a bottle of champagne for mimosas, it was some kind of daily special that they had for the champagne and fresh OJ, paired up with strawberries.  

If I ever visit Scottsdale again, I would definitely make this my number 1 spot to have brunch!"}
{"text":"Ok though I have eaten at Arcadia Farms Cafe and marketplace on many occasions this review is actually on their private dining 'La Cava' room located across the street from the café, it is an elegant, Italian-style dining area that seats up to 20 people with a minimum guest count of 15. 
I held a special event brunch in the room and it was perfection to say the least. 
There is a brunch menu that you're able to choose items for a plated meal. 
With options that are yummy like the French toast and parfait to a more savory choice of frittata or quiche. 
The photos attached are an example of a 20 person seating arrangement. 
Highly recommend considering hosting your next private event with Arcadia Farms!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Pretty outside seating. We had the breakfast panini and the mushroom tart, both very tasty."}
{"text":"Can't say enough praise every step of the way from arrival to end. Service, food and atmosphere are all very much our vibe. We found this enchanting place while staying overnight at the Valley Ho. This experience was an unexpected highlight of our road trip from San Diego. Next time we're through...we'll be in again!"}
{"text":"Pros: 
1) Food 
2) Atmosphere 

Cons: 
1) Cost
2) Service 

TLTR Version: 

Pros: 
1) The food is delicious! My pesto grilled shrimp salad was refreshing and filling, and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his mushroom spinach goat cheese tart. The restaurant uses local and organic ingredients, and supports family-owned farms. 
2) The atmosphere is so welcoming. This place feels like the perfect Mother's Day Brunch spot. It is clean, cozy, and comfortable. We sat on the outside patio under an awning. 

Cons: 
1) The food is expensive! We dropped $60 on lunch. Yes, LUNCH! For. Two. People. No wonder the majority of the patrons were senior citizens - they have retirement money to blow! I enjoyed the crab and avocado appetizer we ordered, but don't think it was worth $13. 
2) The service sucks. Our waitress Janis was not very good. She messed up my order, never checked on us, then silently dropped off our enormous bill without so much as a, \"Thank you for coming in.\" Additionally, they charge for valet parking. Fortunately, we found a free spot down the street."}
{"text":"Great farm to table place for brunch.   Has a rotating menu, great patio, and their sangria is hard to beat."}
{"text":"What an awesome way to start your day here for a brunch with family or friends! Debbie was awesome & was so nice about running back & forth!"}
{"text":"Although I love the food at Arcadia Farms (hence the stars) I'm afraid I'll have stop coming there unfortunately. Today was the second instance where their hostess- Abby- was completely unprofessional an unkind :( we decided to take our in-laws there for lunch with our newborn, we arrived 1 full our before the close time they have posted in their website and their hostess - after making us wait an absurdly long time w/ a superfluous phone call (where she actually recommends other restaurants) - she said that had just made the decision to close earlier sending us out w/ a newborn on 109-degree weather. Rude and unprofessional. It's a shame that I won't be back because of their hostess!"}
{"text":"Simply wasn't impressed!  Arcadia Farms cafe is exactly the sort of place I would normally love for brunch, but I was completely underwhelmed by my first visit.
My group shared peach bellinis, fresh squeezed orange juice, strawberry scones, and chocolate croissants. Our consisted of the two eggs with potatoes and bacon, the goat cheese, spinach and tomato omelette, and the breakfast bruschetta.  In short, everything was \"fine\" but nothing was delicious.  The breakfast potatoes had zero flavor--they seemed like sliced fingerling potatoes that were roasted in olive oil and nothing more.  The omelette was, like everything else, fine but nothing special and I could have made it at home.
I really wanted to like Arcadia Farms with its farm to table philosophy, cute patio, and French pastries, but the food fell short of my expectations."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and fresh, the sangria tasty and the wait staff were friendly without being overbearing. Additionally, the music they were playing caught my ear ... an awesome mix of indie pop rock. They definitely impressed our staff of entertainment bookers and event producers. Thanks for the great lunch, Arcadia Farms!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, quaint and so delicious  the patio is so sweet and the perfect brunch, breakfast or lunch spot. From the moment you walk into the cafe you will love the delicious aromas and chirping birds. Everything on the menu is worth trying and you guaranteed excellent service !!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I came for an early Mother's Day breakfast.  We loved sitting on the patio; we always feel like we are in A cozy cafe in Italy or France when have lunch at our  favourite \" Ladies Who Lunch\"spot. 
The berries and cream crepes were scrumptious! The service was perfect. We plan on returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Best salads in town. And I love the marketplace, just being able to stop in and pick them up pre made. I dont know how long the marketplace has been open but I wish Id have known about it sooner. All they need now is delivery!"}
{"text":"Originally, I had gone here with a group of friends. It was a rainy day in the spring and they had a few cancellations. They were nice enough to squeeze our group of four in on the patio. The service was extremely slow but I wrote it off because we were an unexpected party. 

This weekend I had a group of 8 meeting here. I called in the morning to try and change my 11:30am reservation to 7 guests. I couldn't get through all morning, when I finally did the lady who answered the phone informed me that they were closed due to a circuit breaker issue in the kitchen and that the manager called all the people who had reservations. I did not get a call from anyone regarding this issues. So at 11am on a busy Sunday I had to find a new place for me and six other people to get into. 

I will say the food was very good the first time I went. But the service and this very inconvenient event probably won't have me returning."}
{"text":"I came to the Phoenix Art Museum with my grandparents to see the GORGEOUS collection of clothes and accessories of Ann Bonfoey Taylor. (My new role model. Seriously, look her up. How fabulous and fancy. I need 54 little pill box hast please, stat.) Before perusing the rest of the museum, we stopped in the Cafe for lunch. 

(10% off for members! Make sure to remind your server.)

The dining room was very nice and open...tons of sunny light coming in from the walls of windows, which was delightful. Had the temp been cooler than almost 100 degrees, I'd have loved to sit out on their patio. Like other reviews have noted, it took a bit too long for everything to get rolling: To get sat, to have a server come over, to get water, to get our order taken, for the food to come, etc. Nothing *terrible* but...come on peeps. Pep in your step!

It's a pretty nice menu for vegetarians; each section (apps, salads, sandwiches, entrees) has a few meatless meals. I opted for the Greek salad because 1) I wuv Greek salads and 2) I saw it came with it's own portion of hummus and pita. Heyo!

Hey-NO. The hummus was more of a...chickpea mash and that's IT.  I was so confused, since there were obvious amounts of SOME kind of green herb (Parsley? Cilantro? WHAT?) but it didn't taste like ANYTHING. No Tahini, no zip of lemon juice, no cumin...NOTHING. I'm just going to have to make my own hummus this week, since I make the best in the universe.

The salad, however, was a delight. It's a big portion (as it should be, for $12) and comes with fresh greens, sliced cherry tomatoes, kalamatas, tons of red onion (lucky for me, I love red onion), whole chickpeas and feta. There wasn't too much dressing overpowering the thing, which is such a salad deal-breaker. It almost made me forget my hummus heartbreak. Almost!

Like I said, service was fine and friendly, just weirdly slow. Thurs-Sun there some deal where if you buy a bottle of wine, you get a cheese board for free. Boom! I need to find some friends in AZ and take part in that deal!"}
{"text":"\"Actually we're not taking walk-ins at this time\" how the fuck is this even a business concept? I guess the fact that nothing opens in Scottsdale until 11 AM except for this place and daily dose allows them to be snotty."}
{"text":"Okay, so we had a rather large party of 13 of us, we were seated in the back in a cottage just for us. They do not have a children's menu but were willing to accommodate our 5 children with chicken and cheese quesdillas, which they all loved.....The organic strawberry and chicken salad with organic lettuce was really good, I had to ask for a side of bread which they graciously bought and had to get a side of white vinegar due to an allergy which they were okay with..  Some of the appetizers like the brie and apple could be a bit bigger along with the cheese plate wish that was a bit bigger - these two plates were not big at all and only enough for maybe 3 people.  The hummus which everyone usually likes was not a hit since they put pieces of cucumbers and tomatoes in them, not sure why....The service could have been a little better, as our glasses and drinks were not filled enough or often...We only have one waitress who was trying her best, as before they need more wait staff...Everyone enjoyed their food, I was disappointed in the fact that there salmon is not wild caught, rather they use farm raised Atlantic Salmon, which I do not understand why especially if they are about healthy organic food, farm raised salmon is filled with bacteria, chemicals and pesticides and can make you really sick, if you are used to organic food...Overall pretty good meal, it did not fill us up...as the portions are on the small side.....overall nice meal with family for a special occasion.  We would like to try their breakfast sometime to compare it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while in town for a conference. This was probably the best meal I had during my visit to Scottsdale. The place seemed a bit stuffy at the get go, mostly because they asked if I had a reservation while half the tables sat empty. However, once seated (under a tree in the patio area), everything changed for the best. Really nice, casual place with friendly staff.

I ordered the turkey and brie sandwich. It was AWESOME! It was a nice combination of turkey, jam and cheese, all on some delicious bread. It came with a side of tasty potato salad. One of my friends ordered the Strawberry Chicken salad, which immediately became the envy of our table. If I'm around Scottsdale in the future, I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"This place is very cool   We had breakfast and it was really good. They have a bakery and we bought a few items. They had many cookies, cinnamon rolls with nuts and they bake cakes"}
{"text":"Salads are to die for. Warmed chopped salad is my favorite. Also, the grilled shrimp and feta salad. You really can't go wrong in the salad department here. The atmosphere is wonderful, the patio reminds me of the The Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Comfy couch seating, white table clothes, private dining area. Beautiful trees, waterfalls, flowers etc...surrounding the patio. Great place to catch up with friends. 

Just a heads up, definitely an older crowd...and most of the clientele are women :)"}
{"text":"What a DISAPPOINTMENT!!  After reading such positive reviews, my friend and I thought we would try it.  First we got sat in a separate building from the main restaurant, but we had to walk through the main restaurant to get there, so we were teased by the charm and quaintness of the restaurant but when we got to our building it was like a sparse, cold, unfinished, not so cozy shell of a room, but hey, we were excited to try the food.  So, we started with the warm brie with caramelized apples appetizer.  Service was slow, and we got our appetizer about 15-20 min later. The brie was super oily, perhaps due to heating it too quickly?  Regardless, it was nothing special.  After we were finished with our appetizer, we waited another 15-20 min for our entrees.  We shared the \"award winning\" strawberry, chicken salad, with poppyseed dressing and the Crepes with wild mushrooms, goat cheese and leeks.  The \"award Winning\" strawberry chicken salad was nothing special.  Honestly, Paradise Bakery and Wildflower Bread Co have better salads.  The Crepes were a little better  and more savory but there was a hair in our crepes as we were cutting into them.  We brought it to our waitress' attention and she did not apologize, instead, just looked at us and said, what do you want me to do?  I asked if they could just remake it.  The remake Crepes came out a little more quickly than the first time, except this time, they were burned.  We didn't say anything to the waitress, as we just kinda accepted the fact that maybe it wasn't our day, at this point we just wanted to get our check and get out of there.  In the meantime, we heard the table next to us complain to their waitress that her crabcakes tasted like ammonia (a sign of SPOILED food), and another table was complaining that the service was slow and they had to be somewhere and ended up having to box their food up to go.  Honestly, the apricot iced tea was the best part of our whole meal.  We will NOT be returning to this place."}
{"text":"we had a lunch reservation at this restaurant and we went to visit their bakery across the street first. The bakery is darling with lots of goodies. Great spot to grab a coffee and a pastry! We bought a full cake to have after lunch for my niece and nephews birthday. 

I had the roasted vegetable salad and it was a pretty yummy. The sandwiches all looked very good. My husband said that his turkey club was very good, but nothing too special.

Great ambiance though. NIce size patio and cute decor inside."}
{"text":"Usually get the strawberry chicken salad. Fresh food, good atmosphere. Nice place to take a mom or grandma."}
{"text":"Gabi K and I happen to be \"ladies who lunch.\"

Arcadia Farms is THE perfect location for ladies who lunch, as it turns out...

A perfectly made pitcher of iced tea, an heirloom tomato salad with mini mozzarella balls and sweetly poised basil. VERY good. Everything on the menu was quite tempting, including the desserts that greet you upon entering. EVIL tactics. 

For a moment in time, we were those lucky ladies. I just need more jewelry, and a better car. ;)"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Everything about it. The ambiance is quaint and classy, and makes you feel like you're dining in a little chateau in France. We sat outside at a little corner table with a cushy booth next to a tree with singing birds. 

For starters we ordered a couple strawberry n' cream scones and a chocolate muffin. The scones were to die for. Oh man. Just everything a scone needs to be: warm, buttery, just-a-tad-sweet; perfect. The chocolate muffin was basically cake and also huge, so we had to nibble that one slow.

For a main, I ordered the breakfast quesadilla which comes with fire roasted vegetables, sausage, cheddar cheese, and scrambled eggs inside, with homemade salsa and guacamole on the side. I loved the big chunks of sausage and crispy tortilla. Very satisfying meal when you're as ravenous as I was that morning. I also had a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice to wash it all down. The others enjoyed their mains as well: breakfast panini and an omelet. 

We had a 2-year old with us and ordered him the granola parfait which was beautiful! It came in a goblet with a pile of fresh strawberries on the top. So pretty and delicious. 

I should add that 2 of us hiked in the 7-Summit Challenge the day before, so we probably would have enjoyed anything considering our enormous appetites, but I still stand by my review. The food is amazing and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the breakfast quesadilla and loved it. Lots of veggies and eggs cooked with right firmness and flavor. Salsa was perfectly spicy for breakfast (not too hot or mild). Chocolate croissant was a bit doughy. . 
On my second visit, ordered the breakfast quesadilla and blueberry crepes and shared with a friend. The quesadilla was even better than i had remembered. The tortilla is more like flaky pastry and so tasty. Blueberry crepes simply melt in my mouth. Yum!!! Servise was great from the hostess to the waitress. The courtyard was cozy and comfortable, and definitely adds to the pleasant experience. Overall a great Saturday brunch spot for me.  I have a feeling that this cafe will be receiving a 5 star review on my next visit (For me, 5-star reviews are reserved only for sustained excellent experience and for the best of its kind.)"}
{"text":"I visited the museum last month with some out of town guests and we stopped in to Arcadia Farms Cafe. It was pretty convenient since we got hungry mid trip, but I probably wouldn't eat here again unless I was presented with a similar situation. 

They pre-make all of the food, so you cannot really pick and choose what you want. When I am paying $12 for a quesedilla, I like to be able to say NO MUSHROOMS. But I digress. 

They did have a really, really tasty apricot iced tea. Normally I stick to plain iced tea, but I was feeling adventurous this day and I am glad I tried it. 

There is also a really tasty hummus. I think it has cilantro in it because it has a little zing. 

The server was pretty unfriendly, but she gave good service so I won't complain. 

Overall the food was good, but not worth the expensive prices and inability to be special."}
{"text":"The restaurant is cute, inside and out. We sat outside with misters and it was so comfortable. The inside of the restaurant looked like a house, very home like. Scott ordered an albacore tuna sandwich with a potato salad ( very unique tasting salad,with dill and sour cream)and I ordered the pesto shrimp (grilled) salad, this salad had 4 shrimps, goat cheese, avocado and tortillachips on a bed of lettuce. The dressing was a vinegarette very light but flavorful.This was such a. Ice memorable lunch with such good food!"}
{"text":"Quaint, elegant, and charming; Arcadia Farms is ideal for a ladies lunch date!

I have been coming here since I was 12 years old, and it seems to have aged like fine wine and only gotten better! I had a lunch date with a girlfriend here today and it could not have been more lovely. We were greeted promptly and seated at a cute table on the back patio. The atmosphere was so relaxing and comfortable, and there was even soft music playing in the background. 

Our waitress got us our drinks and took our order in a timely fashion. I ordered the chicken strawberry poppy seed salad and it was incredible; fresh and delicious. She had the greek salad and said it was great as well. Their menu offers lots of different salads, sandwiches, quiches, and appetizers, so there are plenty of options for every mood you are in. We chatted and never felt rushed though our meal which was nice. Our waitress offered us some of their yummy looking cookies and pastries for dessert, but we decided to pass on the calories. Though they all looked incredible if I had felt like indulging I would have lots to choose from! 

The only negative thing I would say is that there were a few times our waitress was not around to get more water, but she did eventually come around. 

The prices are reasonable, but not cheap. You are paying for local and fresh ingredients after all. 

If you are looking for a great lunch place in told town with quality food and lovely ambiance then this is your place!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches, salads, & lunch all around I've had since moving to AZ. Their turkey, brie, fig, apple sandwich is fantastic-best sandwich I've had in my entire life! Nowhere else beats it. Love their salads as well. Great bread is used for their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Each time we visit, we have an even more incredible experience than the last. The food is incredible, the service is impeccable and the restaurant has such charm and warmth. I love to bring family and friends here as often as I can to experience a crown jewel right in Old Town."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day.. had reservations but kitchen was backed up 45 minutes.  Cute place.   Highlights sangria and coconut small cake.  

Hummus good but not $16 good and crab cake, I did not like at all.   Overall, expensive for what you got."}
{"text":"The cutest and freshest brunch spot in all of AZ (or at least so far).
I loved being here.

Notes:
- valet parking across the street, not complimentary. Finding street parking is pretty easy too
- recommend dining at one of their patio tables.
- perfect for celebrating any kind of girly parties (bridal showers, baby showers, etc). 
- definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed with the attitude in the service and the food. The Mediterranean melt was totally dry and lame no flavor. Veggies were so bland and they forgot to put pesto in 3 of our sandwiches !! Sangria was full of ice and all watered down when asked the waitress to remove some ice she was like \"ok but I won't fill it up with more sangria\" I mean who asked you to?!? Drove all the way from cave creek for my bday and totally disappointed myself and my guests who also celebrated a bday!! Get ur act together guys! Hope u read this"}
{"text":"Such a cute find. We sat outside in the shade and had a wonderful breakfast. I want one of these in my neighborhood! 
I'd go back without a second thought."}
{"text":"Management completely mishandled a careless and potentially fatal mistake (my friend made it clear she had an allergy to almonds and found it in her dish). Manager and server just awkwardly asked if they needed to call 9-1-1. When the bill came, they only comped her entree but charged her for her drink and side of bacon. I think the anxiety they caused my friend warrants AT LEAST free bacon and more. Overall, an awkward and uncomfortable experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful little cafe with delicious food-- very fresh--and the staff were so friendly. I had a wild mushroom, leek and goat cheese omelet, it was TO DIE FOR.  I highly recommend-- prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"First, you can't beat the atmosphere or the bakers rack full of pastries at this breakfast spot. I love to come here not only for the chocolate croissants but because they actually have breakfast meals that don't include eggs. I don't like eggs and it's actually really hard to find something substantial on a menu without them. I always get he wild mushroom tart and it is soooo good! And filling. It is served with a side of fruit and also strawberry scones. You will absolutely be full after all of that, but a little pastry to start off with never hurt anyone. The coffee they serve here is also really good. I'm not sure what kind it is but its yummy. 

Good place to bring out of town guests. Everyone loves it. My friend brought her mom the first day of the vacation and she insisted on going back every day after for the duration of the trip! 

Both outside and inside tables are a nice place to be."}
{"text":"It was a great Wednesday afternoon, we decided to check this place out. When we arrived, we asked if we had a reservation, we said no, and the hostess kind of made us feel guilty we didn't make a reservation. She sat us down outside on the patio as we requested. 

The server was very nice. I believe her name was rasheeda. We ordered the goat cheese dip to start, and my, it was phenomenal! It was so tasty. And for entree, I ordered the salmon salad, which had a great light mustard dressing. It was wonderful. The ambiance is great and the food was fantastic. 5 stars!

I would just recommend calling ahead, but I look forward to coming again!"}
{"text":"Walking into this place with my wife last week I was afraid that I might grow breasts and enter menopause...two fantastic acts for being a dude. 

This place is just crawling with ladies lunching, BFFs throwing wedding showers for the college room mates and a few dudes who were brought, or dragged, there by their wives. Note that you would not find Anthony Bordain here

I was not dragged her by my wife...I was STARVING the morning we went so I was open to just checking it out...and I'm glad i did.  If you can get past  the oh-to-well-appointed interior design, you will eat some good food.

We started with the baked brie....burp...a lot of cheese, but good. I followed with a chicken crepe which was great and my wife had their strawberry chicken salad.  Apparently all items we ate are well known from the menu...and it was obvious why...all were great.

To top the lunch off, we split a piece of red velvet cake from their bakery across the street.  The cake was really good...but i suggest splitting it to avoid a super sweet sugar high...and crash.

Dudes, if you need a \"foofy\" place to take your woman to show your \"finer tastes in life\" side, this place fits the requirements...and it tastes good too."}
{"text":"Arcadia always delivers a special experience. Had lunch with a special friend, I had the crab cake with salad and she had the turkey and brie sandwich. Then we had strawberry shortcake for dessert. Everything was fresh and delicious and the service was great. Be sure to stop by the Emporium next door for a take home treat."}
{"text":"Alright boys, get past the fact that it's a little chick centric, Arcadia Farms is a great place to grab a light bite, but leave feeling satisfied and content. 

My group of 3 split the hummus appetizer, and wholly garbanzo bean batman, it was the best hummus I've ever had. It's creamy in texture, strong on garlic and citrus flavor, and served with crispy pita chips that are perfectly seasoned. Next up, the Warm Chopped Vegetable Salad with Grilled Chicken. (Let me pause here: I feel it's my duty to let the Yelp community know that I'm not really a leafy salad guy. I'm  pretty serious when it comes to dining out and don't usually go for the greens. In this instance though, the salad was the first menu item that jumped out at me, and so I felt it was a must. Considering I was there with two people that ordered the same thing, two people that have been to Arcadia Farms, I felt like it was a pretty solid decision.) 

The atmosphere is eclectic end energetic. The restaurant itself is sectioned off into little rooms, and a few times throughout our lunch, I found myself checking out the architecture and the history behind the pretty old building. I suggest calling ahead and making a reservation, or taking your lunch grub back to the office. When I was there on a Monday, the place was packed! And it's no surprise why; great food, good ambiance, and attentive service. Prices seemed a little steep for lunch, but you're paying for an experience, so take someone you're trying to impress and take your time to enjoy."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal! When we walked in, the hostess asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't. As she was about to turn us away, she offered a table in the right corner. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable. We started with an orange cranberry muffin with a glaze on top-incredible! We ordered the breakfast bowl, hash, crepes croque Monsieur, and berry crepes. Everything we ate was delicious!"}
{"text":"What a sweet little place to dine. The atmosphere is cozy and service is great. The food was good. I had the fresh toast Yummm!  While we were waiting for our breakfast the server brought over a few small scones that were AMAZING! I highly recommend this spot for a cozy breakfast!"}
{"text":"This has seriously become one of my favorite spots!!! I am obsessed with their strawberry chicken salad! The cobb salad is also really good! This place is so cute and uses amazing, fresh ingredients. I've been here twice now and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place because the menu makes my mouth water and the ambiance was so nice - the gardens and cozy outdoor seating were so beautiful!  We were greeted at our table ten minutes after being seated. We ordered a pitcher of white sangria, the crab and avocado tower, smoked salmon cheesecake and wild mushroom tart. The pitcher of sangria was delicious when it finally arrived (another ten minutes)- the cup had raspberries and a strawberry in it with orange juice and white wine. The crab and avocado tower had corn inside and gazpacho with it. We had to add salt - it was extremely bland. If you just want to taste avocado and crab, you will love it! If you want extra flava', try something else! The smoked salmon cheesecake was disappointing. A little cute cheesecake that looked smooth on the outside, but crumbled into dry cheese balls on the inside with a very tiny portion of smoked salmon served on the side. House cured smoked salmon is one of my most favorite things - this place will not be remembered for this dish. It was the first time I could describe cured salmon as bland! The one good thing that I would eat again and go back for is the wild mushroom tart. Melted cheese over a soft tart with wild mushrooms and leeks - wonderful wonderful savory dish. We never saw our server for most of the meal. If I went back again, I would try one of the big salads I saw at tables around us and that tart again. But I would make sure I went on a day where I had plenty of time for an extremely slow lunch where I don't mind extremely slow service. All in all, comci comca!"}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I've had such a picturesque brunch. The patio at Arcadia Farms is absolutely beautiful, and it almost reminded me of the times I had brunch in Key West (which, trust me, is definitely a good thing.) Our group of six grabbed a round table on the patio under a huge tree, and it almost felt like we were brunching in a treehouse. In case you can't already tell, I really loved my experience here.

The coffee was strong and much-appreciated after a long travel day the day before, and the iced tea had something fruity going on which was quite refreshing. The menu is pretty big and I was happy to see so many unique items. And can we just talk about the warm strawberry shortcake? I wanted to, but I decided to be \"good\" and go with something a little healthier.

I ordered the mushroom and chive omelet with goat cheese, and added tomato and spinach. I loved how fresh everything was and how generous they were with the vegetables! I subbed fruit for the potatoes but they gave me both (dammit.) I ended up being happy to have a few potatoes along with the great spread of fruit. It was a really healthy, happy & colorful way to start the day! Service was a bit slow but this isn't a place you go to for a quick meal. Visit, enjoy, and definitely score a seat on the patio.

Awesome place. I hope to visit again sometime soon for that cake!"}
{"text":"This place is for the ladies who lunch! Great brunch/lunch dinning! Lovely patio! champagne and cocktails! Great location in old town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Our server was as dry as the chocolate pecan pie we ordered. The Mushroom Spinach tart was delicious, the salad was fresh (wish I could say the same for our service lol) 
Recommend for breakfast, there are better lunch spots though. The ambiance here is very cozy, which is something that I've always enjoyed."}
{"text":"What's a French cottage doing in the middle of Scottsdale? I don't know, but I adore it. I had lunch here with my lovely gal pals, along with scores of other ladies who lunch. Everything is so dainty and cute here, it might not be a dining destination of choice for most manly men. But no doubt that the guys who have eaten here will tell you that the food is pretty amazing.

Farm-to-table food is dished up here, and there is not one thing on the menu that won't tantalize your taste buds. I had such a hard time deciding what to get, and after looking around at other tables and digging deep into my own cravings, I decided to order their Chicken, Wild Mushroom and Leek Crepes with goat cheese and basil beurre blanc. Wow, was this decadent! It's saucey, which I wasn't expecting, so it was a bit rich. But the combination of ingredients were delicious and I ate every last bite. The salads that my friends had looked fantastic as well, and portions were huge. I was also eying the Wild Mushroom, Spinach and Goat Cheese Tart and their signature strawberry chicken salad, but unfortunately, I'll have to wait for my next trip back to AZ to taste them. 

Of course, we had to make room for dessert. You must not skip their desserts! Again, everything sounded wonderful, but we went with a carrot baby cake and a coconut baby cake. Don't be misled - these cakes are not bite size. We had to take at least half of each home because they were so big. 

A beautiful setting for a lovely lunch, and if it's gorgeous out, try to snag one of their patio tables out back. It's places like these that make me wish I was a professional lady who lunches!"}
{"text":"We had the most wonderful and delicious breakfast at Arcadia! Our server, Polly, was incredibly kind helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. She gave great recommendations, was generous in the mimosa pours and we left very happy! Would absolutely come here again for the cute ambiance, great food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Went for our friend's 80th birthday party and every bit was fantastic!  We love this place. Quaint old school charm in the heart of Scottsdale. A definite must for locals or out of town visitors."}
{"text":"I had the apple brie with fruit and crackers and a brownie sundae.  Really delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the cutest place ever! There is outdoor and indoor seating. The decorations are all unique and it makes the perfect date spot. They come out with some toasted breadsticks that have some cheese/garlic flavor to them and they are addicting. So good that we got some extra to take home. Don't judge me till you try it! I ordered the chicken and goat cheese sandwich. It was very filling and I probably won't get it next time because it was just too much. The chicken quesadilla is a score! Cheesy goodness with some home made guacamole= heaven on a plate. Service was great."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I love the quaint style of this restaurant, many cute little rooms and a nice outdoor space. I do recommend you make a reservation for lunch, even during the week.

 I like how everything is organic and fresh.

I like the hummus and spicy pita chip appetizer.

Also the Arcadia Greek Salad which is fresh and rather large. It is just an average Greek Salad though.

The Mediterranean Melt is a winner.

I do think that the prices are a little steep for the product, but it is fresh and the ambiance is nice. 

Parking is a little annoying, but you can valet.
I plan to head for breakfast at Arcadia Farms soon."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! One of my favs is the leek crepe. The service is a little lacking though."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms is a great place to go when you are out on a shopping day with your mom or best friend; or for a shower; or for an intimate lunch with your honey.  

Everything is always fresh and they have THE BEST apricot iced tea.  

Their private rooms are really sweet and can accommodate quite a few people.  My sister in law's bridal shower was held here and there must have been 20 or 30 people there."}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE FOOD AND THE SERVICE. two tiny crab
cakes and a plate full of lettuce. I ordered raspberry salad with goat cheese.
two squares of goat cheese and a few raspberries and pecans, rest was lettuce.
our waitress must of had stations inside because she just disappears and we had to ask
another waitress to find he Have eaten here many times.  This time was a disappointment"}
{"text":"We went, taking our 101 yr old friend. My Greek salad was shy of everything but lettuce. Left hungry, really & I am a very small guy. My wife & our friend had shrimp salads, which had fresh good greens, but like my Greek salad, didn't have much else besides the 4 shrimp, which were tasty. All salads had sparse dressing. We'd have liked bread, but wasn't offered. Pricey, but good ambiance. Place was jam packed with women. Only 3 of us males-never seen anything like that but that's nothing against the place. I stopped for a Snickers on the way back. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The service is HORRIBLE. Bunch of elitists!!!  We were standing around for about 5 minutes while the ladies who is supposed to help us finished their private conversation. Will never go back"}
{"text":"Upscale breakfast/lunch spot right in the heart of old town. Tried for breakfast on a recent Sunday and just missed, so we settled for lunch... Everything from the valet service to the view of the rear courtyard was exceptional. Service and ingredients are top notch.

A little pricey but a nice treat on occasion."}
{"text":"Three words: bland, expensive, bland. I went with a friend and she ordered a ham sandwich and I ordered crab cakes. We were both disappointed and found this place way OVERRATED. I think you pay for the atmosphere because the food is just your average lunch."}
{"text":"Picture the cutest house you can imagine, fill it full of darling table and chairs through out the inside, as well as on 3 separate patio areas. With large open doors and windows that even make the inside seem as if you are dining al fresco. Then add a large tree in the front yard that acts as a living awning, throw in a fabulous menu from brunch to lunch and into the evening... and well, you get the Arcadia Farms Cafe!"}
{"text":"Do not go to this place if you are hungry.  I am very disappointed with this Arcadia Farms.  I have never had such a horrible experience at one location.  Some friends and I went here for breakfast on a Sunday only to find out that they stopped serving breakfast at 11 am.  This doesn't make sense.  We decided that we would stay for  lunch.  I decided to split the California Turkey Club with the potato salad  with a friend.  After 45 minutes later, we finally got our food.  The server did stop to tell us that the kitchen was behind but made no offer if we would like some bread to pass the time.  The California Turkey Club was very disappointing.  It was all bread and nothing in the middle.  Very little turkey on this sandwich.  I wish the server would have said how the potato said was made.  It was covered in mayo which did not sit well with our stomachs.  I have been to Arcadia Farms before for breakfast and had an amazing entree and service.  This time the food and service were really lacking.  We received our bill and noticed that we got charged $3 for splitting our plates.  I did not see this on the menu or  the server did not mention to us when we placed the order.  $3 for a can of Diet Coke?!  Why are you upcharging for a can of soda?  I love supporting local places but this place has lost a customer."}
{"text":"What I need to know is how the heck am I an AZ native and I've never been to this tucked away little gem of an eatery??  
I went to lunch here today with 2 of my colleagues, and start to finish was amazing.  Started with the brie with apples & pears.  The apples were bruleed and the brie was baked to perfection.  I ordered the salmon with baby vegetables over greens, the others ordered the goat cheese/mushroom/chicken tart, and the goat cheese/mushroom crepe.  When I saw the tart, I was kicking myself for not going that route.  But one bite of the delicious salmon and I was just fine with my choice.  The baby carrots, green beans, and fingerling potato's were cooked perfectly al dente. The friends raved about the tart and the crepe.  We ended the meal by sharing the red velvet cake.  One slice was HUGE and was layered with cream cheese frosting....YUMM!!!!!  Oh, and I failed to mention that Wednesday is HALF PRICE bottle of wine day!  OMG, we totally scored!!!  Do yourself a favor and check this place out.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Arcadia Farms for years. I have had a few issues in the past with service but after my last visit I will not be returning. We made a reservation and asked to sit inside, the host said it would be about 20 minutes for inside seating even though there were about three visible open tables inside. The host made it seem like we were inconveniencing her. When we asked if we could sit at one of the tables inside she said \"that's a table for 6\" (we had four people). 
We sat outside and had a waitress named Janis. She brought out our food order and was snippy when one of the entrees was completely wrong, no apology. When the bill came the item we didn't order was on the bill. We ask her to fix the bill and she comes back saying that she tried to get us a discount but she had to void that transition because she wasn't allowed to give discounts. The receipt just had \"void\" written on it in pen. We waited for the correct bill and the whole closing out took about 25 minutes. 
The manager was extremely nice and apologetic. She gave us a couple desserts and said she would take care of us when we returned. Cute place and good food but the management needs to see that some of their employees are bringing it down."}
{"text":"This is by far one of most most favorite spots back in AZ.  Coming here always reminds me that I am home.  From the moment you step inside it is like a you are in another place.  The WILD Mushroom, Spinach and Leek Quiche is amazing and the Warm Brie with Caramelized Apples are phenomenal.  I can not wait to return."}
{"text":"The location and setting are lovely. I'm giving it a low score for service. We placed a beverage order as soon as we arrived. The temperature outside was quite warm, despite the misters. We waited 20 minutes and still no drinks were brought. I ordered a Diet Coke and mom a lemonade. Finally I had to flag down a different server and ask to have our beverages brought to us. 
The Shrimp Pesto salad had a skewer of 5 little shrimp, was cold and bland. No pesto anywhere. The Strawberry Chicken salad. Mine had generous helping of chicken but was drenched in a sugary dressing with very little flavor. The mixed greens certainly were not a mix! Overall I was disappointed with the food and service."}
{"text":"VERY VERY VERY Good.  Try everything at least once as the entire menu is great. The homemade breads are always the best you will ever have, fresh salads, amazing sandwiches and just everything is great. The people with 1 or 2 stars, not sure what you were on that day but try it again.  No way it is anything but 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great service and cute place!  Food was excellent too.  It was raining outside, so it wasn't too busy.  Love the country feeling of the place.  They give you complimentary berry scones, which are yummy!"}
{"text":"Okay -- maybe I was just too excited about this place seeing all the wonderful Yelp reviews, or maybe I wasn't daring enough to try something more unique. It was good. 

I had the Strawberry Chicken Salad. It was kind of bland and not too memorable. Same with the Mango Iced Tea. Next time I'll definitely have to get something more out there and hopefully it will be enough to win a 5 star updated review! 

Service was great! And I loved the ambience more than anything. Cute and quaint. I will def go back :)"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Arcadia Farms in a couple of years and man am I missing out! This place is still absolutely delicious with a great atmosphere and charming decor. I definitely find it to be more of a \"girly\" place; everytime I go there is a bridal shower or baby shower going on. I went with one of my girlfriends for lunch last weekend and we were seated outside on their cute patio. We started with the white sangria which was very refreshing, it's mixed with orange juice (or at least that's what it tasted like) and it was perfect, not too sweet. We split the warm brie appetizer which was amazing - came with crostini, grapes, and apple slices. It was perfect with the sangria and we finished every last crumb. For my entree, I got the goat cheese, mushroom and spinach tart and it was delish, my only complaint was that there wasn't more goat cheese in it....one of my favorite cheeses! It came with a simple spinach salad which complimented the flavorful tart very well. They have several desserts, pastries and cookies there that I wanted to try so badly, but I was too full. Next time Arcadia Farms! One thing to note, call to make a reservation - there is typically a wait here but trust me it's worth it."}
{"text":"Bad experience. We had some friends from out of town visiting us and we took them to Arcadia Farms for brunch last saturday. We got there at around 10:30ish and we had 2 babies (18 months). The seating staff seemed annoyed that they had to accommodate our babies. It was a very cold and chilly morning and they offered us outside seating at this one table under a tree in the shade with a cold wind tunnel. We explained one of the babies was a bit sick but they didn't seem to care and said they don't have many tables inside and can only seat us inside at the condition of having the babies in our lap! They said they ran out of high chairs and i swear to God, i only saw 1 other child inside this place! We kindly explained it will be very hard to contain the babies in our arms and try to eat and asked if we could at least take our strollers and keep the babies in(and we had umbrella strollers not the big bulky kind!)) and they refused! basically they gave us no real option. We could either sit outside and freeze(there were 3 other tables out in the sun and they refused to give them to us and they offered one of them to a party that came after us btw) or we could sit inside and hold the babies in our laps while eating. 
So we basically pleaded and the hostess was so frazzled as if we had asked her to wake a sleeping ogre or something! We finally decided to take a chance and asked to sit inside without any high chairs and as soon as we walked to our table we noticed there were 10-12 empty tables! They gave us such a hard time when more than half the place was empty! How truly disgusting. We were so upset. 
To top it all, when it was time to order it was abt 11:05 and our server said we could not order any breakfast items, only lunch and she couldn't do anything abt it. And she went on to mention they didn't really have any food for the kids. I asked her to make a cheese quesadilla and they brought out the hardest tortilla(as if they soaked it in oil and fried it or something). The kids couldn't even eat it. 

The food was very sub par, extremely disappointing! Our friends were appalled at how uncourteous and somehow partial the staff had been towards us. Very very disappointing experience. Will not go back and will def not recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms is probably my most favorite place for lunch in Scottsdale. The food is always fresh and delicious. The servers are great people. I like taking my friends there when they come to visit. The atmosphere is shabby chic and charming."}
{"text":"For our annual vacation breakfast at Arcadia Farms, I had the berry crepe again (sweet mascarpone cheese, berry coulis and whipped cream topped with toasted candied almonds), which was every bit as good as I remembered. Great bacon side too (although three pieces is a little stingy). My girlfriend's Breakfast Bruschetta (scrambled eggs, smoked mozzarella and sausage on artisanal bread) was also excellent.

It does seem like Arcadia Farms could stand some minor fixes -- our table was quite rickety, and an electrical outlet cover opposite us was broken (exposing the inside of the wall slightly) -- but the food continues to be exceptional."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Scottsdale AZ for a visit, we stop by.  This time was the second time we received bad service.  The restaurant is known for it's natural cuisine, but sometimes it is not that tasty.  I will say that except for the chicken apple sausage, the french toast was okay, but it wouldn't hurt to have a small side of fresh creamery butter for it.  I would love to give more stars, but AF, you're going to have to earn them.  I will say the people in the Marketplace are much better in their customer service.  Do try the pastries in the Marketplace next door, the coconut and tuxedo cakes are to die for.  I would give the Marketplace 5 stars."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Arcadia and we discovered this charming little spot. The food is good and the waitresses are very nice, and of course the strawberry scones are a favorite as well. The reason I cannot give it more than three stars is the hostess. 
Her service (or lack thereof) has only gotten worse. She hardly ever greets you with a good morning or a hello and when she does speak to you she doesn't make eye contact and just asks \"how many?\" Followed by a \"Follow me.\" If you look up the definition of \"hostess\" she surely does not fit the bill. Seeing as the hostess of an establishment sets the tone for your initial experience, a business (especially one as busy as this one) should make customer service a top priority. She also seems overwhelmed with answering the phones, checking table numbers and seating. Bottom line, if she has to be there, at least get a second hostess to divide the tasks. A reminder to smile, greet and be hospitable wouldn't be a bad idea either."}
{"text":"We went in January I was so excited to take my family there. I had been there the year prior when we were in town. It was awful!!! We had a 2:30 reservation which we didn't get seated for 30 minutes to a dirty table. Then when we ordered. They were out of shrimp for the salad that my daughters wanted. And they were out of raspberries for the \"Raspberry Salad. The poor wait staff where running around like chickens with there heads cut off. I will never go back."}
{"text":"On a visit in late December we had lunch in the courtyard on a warm and sunny day in Scottsdale. The Arizona winter sun was warm against our skin and the soup, salad and sandwiches were fresh and tasty. Arcadia Farms is an Arizona classic, and not just for ladies anymore - although over 80% of the diners at lunch consistently are the fairer sex. Men: go forth and enjoy, too. One of the best lunch places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My sister took me to Arcadia Farms Cafe for lunch, one of her favorite spots in Old Town Scottsdale.  I had the chicken Cobb salad, and it was so fresh and delicious!  She'd warned me ahead of time that the service there was slow... but that still didn't prepare me for how long it took to get a drink, an order, even just a cookie and a check!  It's the kind of place where you need to be ready to help them speed along, like being that person who asks for a check when you're ordering dessert.  Otherwise, you're stuck.

But the food is SO GOOD, guys.  Seriously, so good.  We had a lemon cookie to split for dessert and it was heavenly.  I can see why people would come back to a place like this, where the service is 2-star but the food is 4-star!  (Averaged to 3 stars)  Again, come for the food, but don't be in a rush, even for a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"We had a big girls brunch here.  The food was excellent and they were very accommodating of a large group with babies.  Service was a little slow and our server would forget thing, but overall it was a cute place with excellent food."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this restaurant is nice--there is a beautiful patio area with umbrellas and a big tree, BUT the cute factor does not make up for the rude waitstaff and mediocre food. There is an unfriendly vibe to the restaurant. I came with one of my friends of color and she was treated rudely when asking where the bathroom was. It was not a friendly environment."}
{"text":"Wow. What a trip. The quintessential ladies who lunch spot. I thought for sure I'd see June Cleaver here. These women shop and lunch for sport. I'm sure they lettered it in back in the day. A lovely shaded and flowered patio full of wine swilling dames, swapping stories of infedility, recipes gone bad and where to go for botox. These are things I actually eavesdropped, er, um overheard. I had some delicous rolls before the famous strawberry salad. Salad? Hmmm. Pretty damn good. And in the if you can't beat 'em join 'em category. I had a split of Pop. A French champagne served with a straw. Yes people. A straw. Makes the bubbles fizzier and the buzz quicker. Highly recommended. A great place to take mom, granny or your favorite tranny."}
{"text":"My family and I had a lovely brunch here. You walk in and assume it's a small cramped place, but they more seating in the back patio, and second building made for larger parties beyond the patio. I liked how they brought out biscuits before our meals came out. Biscuits!

They were really accommodating to our needs. They sat us in the second building and made sure we were warm and comfy where we sat. They got one of our orders wrong but were quick to fix it. I ordered the Smoked Salmon plate. I had no idea it came with a side of greens. This plate was really too much for me to eat. There was a generous amount of smokes salmon, that my mom ended up helping me eat this. That's not a bad problem to have though. 

I didn't eat any of my side salad. I don't remember ever getting dressing for it. And I had a small bite and it didn't taste like it was tossed in any dressing. Oh well, I wasn't in the mood for eating anything green at that time. Overall I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was good and a very pleasant little adventure in Scottsdale. Five Stars as I would love to go back and my wife really liked it too.

Location: In or near old Scottsdale which is being revitalized with renewal and new building going on everywhere. Sort of on a side street. You will not drive by it unless looking for it.

Venue: There are really two parts to this place. The well-established restaurant which is to the left, and the newer, sort of annexed shop on the right, called the marketplace. Being our first time here, we didn't notice the restaurant part but spotted the Marketplace side which also served food. Nicely decorated farm house sort of theme.  So this review is mostly for the Marketplace side of the business. We would have gone to the restaurant side for breakfast if we knew.

The marketplace has a few parking spots right in front, a couple of outdoor tables, and a larger indoor portion with a bakery, drink station and food prep area for the menu items. It also has gift or souvenir items which my wife enjoyed looking at.

Food: Wife ordered a smoked salmon, cream cheese on english muffin or ciabatta bread and loved it. She had hot tea and they happened to have some flavored green tea which she enjoyed. We found it amusing that the waitress was surprised that anyone would ever ask for green tea, plain. LoL   I joked that we should really mess with her and ask for rice...we are in Arizona and not at home in Hawaii. I had a sort of scalloped potatoes dish which was vegetarian and very good. I forgot the name of the dish.  I also had some black coffee that was dark and rich. $2.50 for a 16 oz cup!!! Yeah we are not in Hawaii!  Also of note, each of our dishes was less than $8. 

Service: Everyone was pleasant and helpful. Each seemed to have their specific role and no crossover was allowed. The main Waitress was doing a 5 Star job and it was only her second day on the job. She was doing everything. So I watched as I thought this was interesting. An owner, a second owner, and a daughter and a granddaughter were letting her do all the work! Then we ordered food and the granddaughter and cook sprang into action. The daughter delivered the food. The waitress went to get our drinks and of course the machine was out of coffee, so she had to remake it herself even though things were getting busy...interesting arrangement but it seemed to work for them. I hope the new waitress will be appreciated as she seemed to be handling everything on her own. I left her a good tip. The owners were not the ogres that I imagined them to be at first. All seemed good. I just thought it was interesting to observe the work arrangement.

We both liked it and my wife bought a few extra items that appealed to her for herself. Im going with 5 stars and really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Its okay... 
Foods good.. Had the strawberry salad 
Service is good... 
Just really don't care for the clientele. Snooty Scottsdale women who \"lunch\". 
Perhaps I wasn't in the mood, I don't know. Just did nothing for me. 
Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic little cafe! I had a great brunch here earlier today, on the patio with my girlfriends. The food is priced very affordable and it was delicious. The staff were very kind as well. I give this five stars for a wonderful experience all the way around."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying:
1. I NEVER write yelp reviews. Nor do I read them often
2. I am a brunch snob. I live in Chicago and we brunch often at some of the best restaurants 

With that being said- this is the BEST brunch I've ever had. The atmosphere is incredible, calming, and everything you hope for in brunch.

The food so awesome! I am a plain Jane who doesn't like new things but the quesadilla has changed my views on trying new food.

Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch at Arcadia Farms is so nice - relaxing - never feel rushed ~ although there is a constant stream of people coming in ~ 
Our waitress was so pleasant and made suggestions for lunch.  Awesome meal - my friend raved about her shrimp salad!  Albacore sandwich is always delish.       Love coming to this great establishment right in the heart of downtown Scottsdale.  Great food, great service*****"}
{"text":"The rumors are true... its the ultimate ladies lunching kind of place. You can't go here on a weekend without seeing a baby shower, bridal shower or just a group of women gabbing and enjoying the uber-girly decor and garden setting. 

The best part? The food is just as good as the vibe. If you're looking to get in with your future mother-in-law - take her here."}
{"text":"My friend, my toddler and I enjoyed lunch here today on their beautiful patio. Our mouths watered the entire drive there as we talked about the menu (we had looked it up on-line) and discussed what we would order. We were immediately seated even though we didn't have a reservation on a Friday at noon and they have high chairs which I always appreciate (and I'm sure most of you, rightfully, could care less about). 

It didn't take us long before we decided on some white sangria, the crab and avocado tower, savory smoked salmon cheesecake and the wild mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart. The waitress told us that if we wanted everything to come out at once it would be faster. OK. Doesn't make sense to us, but whatever you say. Meanwhile we enjoyed our sangria which was garnished with beautiful fresh fruit but tasted pretty heavy on the OJ. While I've never met a white sangria I didn't like, I have to say the Chelsea's Kitchen's white sangria is much better. Of course everything at Chelsea's Kitchen is so heavenly, God must be working in the kitchen and if that's the case, he mixes a mean drink (and my God mixes cocktails), but I digress. 

The three plates arrived together and we started on the goat cheese and mushroom tart first since it was warm. It was so delicious I wanted to hold it in my mouth a little longer than one might consider \"normal\" just so it's beautiful cheesey, silky, earthy, mushroomness wouldn't have to vacate my taste buds so soon. Leeks, mushrooms and goat cheese - now that's a menage a trois! Maybe I was a little clairvoyant when I saved the last few bites of it to eat at the end of the meal to have that flavor left in my mouth last. 

Next we had the crab and avocado tower. My toddler has a thing for seafood so he had the first bite and we probably should have paid more attention when he didn't finish what I gave him. It had such a beautiful presentation, not much thought was given to seasoning the crab mixture. Now don't get me wrong, the crab was incredibly fresh, it was just bland. It needed a splash of citrus to brighten it. It also came with a small bowl of bland gazpacho that we fixed with salt and pepper but we weren't sure what to do with it. The dish didn't come with a spoon so surely it wasn't meant to be eaten that way. Was the crab meant to be dipped into it? That didn't work well because you couldn't get the chunks of veggies (and I like my veggies). We gave up and dumped in onto the plate and swilled our crab into it. The acid in the tomatoes helped perk up the bland crab a little bit. 

We saved what we thought was the best for last. The smoked salmon cheesecake. It looked so beautiful on the plate. Almost like a little cake frosted in mascarpone and garnished with capers. We cut into in and spread it on the toasted french bread and shoved it into our salivating mouths (and the salivating, demanding toddler). We both stopped chewing and just stared at each other. It was so bland, If it wasn't pink inside and I didn't know it was a smoked salmon cheesecake, I probably never would have guessed. And the worst part yet, the inside was dry and crumbly. I don't know about you but when I think of cheesecake, creaminess is at the forefront. We picked at it then my toddler ate the rest of it straight up with his fingers. Not only does he have a taste for seafood but he has a gourmet cheese fetish. The stinkier and more expensive, he thinks the better. What do they say about champagne wishes and caviar dreams? 

We were going to have dessert but decided against it. We figured we would cut our losses and move on. I understand why it's so popular with the senior set if what they say is true about older people liking blander food. Maybe Sunday brunch is better, maybe we ordered the wrong things on the menu. If you're interested only in the ambiance though, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks and pastries.  Must try the Strawberry Chicken Salad!"}
{"text":"Highly reccomend trying the Grilled Veggie & Chicken Quesadilla and the Black and White Mini Cake.  Very cute restaurant with a nice patio."}
{"text":"i love this spot!  so cute and amazing food. try the goat cheese appetizer and the herb chicken sandwich. you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Um wow. The service here is awful. I have really never been compelled to write a review but just want to say... be prepared to wait for drinks for at least 20 mins. I wasn't even asked even though I was sitting alone and many couples came in after me. Waitresses will walk away while people are still talking to them. Other than the horrible service, I can't speak on the food because I haven't been able to order. The place is very cute though. I ended up leaving after 35 minutes of no one addressing me right on the front. :("}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place and wanted to try it. I brought a girlfriend in for her birthday. It's a bit cramped but is still a nice atmosphere. We came at the end of brunch and were only able to get lunch which wasn't ideal. I'd like to give the place 5 stars but our server was pretty rude to us. I hope that if I make it back I will have a better experience."}
{"text":"The food was ok but service was horrible.  Went last Saturday for lunch (8 adults, 3 kids).  We were the last to arrive in our party so the rest have already ordered appetizers.  As soon as our server got our drink order, I ordered a cheese quesadilla for my toddler.  I also ordered a cheese plate for appetizer.  My friends' appetizer orders came so I asked if my cheese plate was coming.  Server said I thought you wanted it with your lunch entree.  Ok fine I guess I have to specify I want my appetizer served first?!?!! My main entree came but my cheese plate and my toddler's quesadilla still haven't arrived!  I asked to cancel the cheese plate and he said it is already ready, he just need to bring it out.  It was obviously not ready because it did not come until about 10-15mins later.  Finally, we've asked for our checks to be split and he said it would be too hard to do!  So basically a NO!  And because we had a big party, we were automatically charged 20% gratuity.  I will never recommend this place.  Food is ok, nothing great to rave about.  Service is awful!"}
{"text":"I would have to give this place a 2.5 stars. First off service is extremely slow & that us defiantly this places major down fall .I went here with a girlfriend and her brand new baby and my 2 yr old daughter it took them 2.5 hrs to get us out of there ? Thank god our children were well behaved, it took about 10-15 min after ring seated for someone to come around and ask for our drink order. Then when we wanted to place order I wanted the turkey & Brie sandwich minus the Brie our waiter informed me that food is pre made  & I couldn't get that ? For $14.00 sandwhich I would expect a fresh one made at least so I changed my order to the chicken quesadilla it was very tasty :) we waited around for our check for about an hr or so we were just chit chatting so didn't realize it had been that long but to add insult to injury my girlfriend paid cash & for her meal & never had her change brought out the server we finally flagged down and said could you bring our change and she was like of you want change ? Uh yeah I want my change so that pissed my friend off big time we were getting up to leave & the server was hovering around to get her tip very annoying because whenever we needed to be served she was no where to be found ?  The restaurant itself very cute & charming & could have a ton of potential but I would rather go elsewhere for the price & service. Overall food was just ok nothing special. I did check out the little market across street to get daughter a cookie very friendly staff & cookie was delicious :)"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and food! They have a wonderful display and great home made pastries on display that are not only mouth watering to look at, but also enjoy. Janice runs the store and does a great job helping the customers and the staff. Truly a wonderful place for fun meal!"}
{"text":"To be quite honest, I think one star is one star too many for mine and my family's experience today at Arcadia Farms Cafe. We arrived at 12:30 pm, and there was a line of people out to the door waiting to be seated which was expected from a restaurant, I guess. We were totally okay waiting 10 minutes to be seated. Once we were seated, with two out of the three menus that were needed, we chatted and noticed that no one had even bothered to ask for our order in 30 minutes--we weren't even saluted by a waitress or given water. It was a bit concerning so, one of us stood up and left to ask if we could get our order taken. After a few minutes, a waitress came to give us our well-deserved water and until what felt like an eternity, came up again with another waitress to get our order. My sister asked if the \"FRESHLY-SQUEZZED orange juice\" was any good. The waitress replied by telling all of us that the supposed freshly-squeezed orange was anything but. Adding to our theme of freshness--or lack thereof, she also told us that all of their sandwiches were pre-made! Meaning that they prepare them well in advance. \"Why am I paying $14 for a reheated sandwich\" is what I asked myself. Finally after another thirty minutes, I alone walked to Kaleidoscope Juicery to get some vegan pastries since Arcadia Farms is falling behind on that among other trends, like having an adequate amount of waiters/waitresses. After a 15 minute walk, we had not received our meals yet. So, we left: hungry, tired, and truly disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out if you are elderly and/or have nothing to do for a few hours....jeez!"}
{"text":"Carolyn opened up her heart and restaurant to do a Memorial for a dear friend Kathie Foster a couple weeks ago. What can I say but 'Thank You!\" It was just perfect in every way. The mood...the tables...the food...the details. Everyone raved and we knew at the end of the lovely lunch..... Kathie would have just loved it. If you have a special event...you should be having it here!"}
{"text":"Lovely little place! It feels like the perfect place to take your Mom out to a nice lunch

I've had the Shrimp-something-something-Salad (it had avocado, goat cheese, tortilla strips?) It was great! 

annnnnddd I've had the chopped veggie salad- Also great! 

I kinda want to try all their salads now and pick my fav."}
{"text":"Whatever, we tried to to go to cafe Monarch across the street but they were closed for the holidays. We decided to go to poison pen across the street (which is awesome BTW) and they recommended Arcadia farms.

So head over, wait around for the hostess for a minute and take a seat in the back patio. The place is very...pretty? for the lack of a better word, definitely a good spot to take a lunchoen date to.

The bread was good that they gave us, little cheese crust on it. Had the apricot iced tea and it was quite alright. I asked for the cheese selection list and our server said they were out of one of the cheese's, so I made my selection and a couple of minutes later she came back and told us that they were out of 2 of the three cheese's that I had chose, so I just scraped the whole cheese idea and went with the California sandwich.

My friend had the ham and cheese and he said it was good, he ordered the soup of the day with his entree, which was butternut squash, it tasted like brown sugar candy liquid with little cubes of unseasoned butternut squash, couldn't finish it.

We ate our sandwiches and had half of them boxed up. our server asked us if we would like to see there dessert menu since that was what they were really known for. I said sure, she dropped them on the table, After looking at our dessert menus for 18 minutes our server shows up and asks us if we had made a decision, I said I had made several, But all I really wanted was the check.

So the food wasn't bad but it wasn't great, Maybe the desserts are great but i'll never know. In my opinion this place is an upscale applebees, just an extremely boring menu of sandwiches and salads, made with better ingredients."}
{"text":"I went to AFC with my dad and gram about a week ago. There were some big pros and cons: 


Pros:

Strawberry salad - the salad was very tasty, the strawberries were large, it had big pieces of chicken that were fairly juicy. I would order this again. 

The quesadilla - very tasty quesadilla with fresh veg, salsa, and guac. I liked how they browned the tortilla significantly and that it resulted in a nice crunch when you bite into it. 

Cons:

The roasted chicken sandwich... this was dry, bland, and just not good... and it sounded so good! Do not order. 

The service: Very slow, inattentive

The seating- when I entered the restaurant, the front room was fairly empty, yet they seated us in their back room. This room, though most likely intended for overflow seating, was packed with people (possibly the less fancy people, lest we infringe on the 'ladies who lunch'). This space was extremely loud, the materials it is made out of echo every sound, you can hardly hear yourself think. The door also needs to be pulled closed, and when it wasn't (which happened several times) it got extremely hot. 

The prices - this place is overpriced for the food you receive... it's a sandwich guys...much of the food isn't even cooked. 


Anyway, this would not be one of my go to places, but if invited here by family or friends, I would come back."}
{"text":"Nice fresh farm to table restaurant with delicious food.  Cute restaurant with outside patio with water mister system very necessary on the 106F day of our meal.  We will return."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. It's cute, great location, flowers and trees everywhere you look, fantastic patio, interesting menu. The reality is that parking is awful, birds whiz by your face and scamper across the awning constantly. Food was sub par, lacking in effort and overpriced. Cheese plate was lifeless, raspberry salad was uninspired and the turkey and brie sandwich we inquired about was \"pre assembled\" so we couldn't substitute for a different bread. The service was good and place seemed clean, think perhaps it's just not my cup of tea. I strive to find food made with love and lots of attention to detail. This seemed more pre made/churned out/ bland, etc. I know back in the 1990s this was the place to go, maybe a little reboot is necessary. Too many other options in South Scottsdale these days. Cute to look at from the outside. Enjoy your luncheons, ladies."}
{"text":"The place is so cute, has such a nice, sweet vibe. Both times that I've gone the service has been a little slow - probably because it gets really packed for brunch but still kind noticeably slow. The food is great. Small portions, for the most part, but good quality. Really cute spot to go on a date or bring friends from out of town. They also have a really cute bakery/shop next door that's worth a visit. The strawberry vanilla bean jam is actually the most amazing thing in the world. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Dear Arcadia Farms, When someone makes a reservation for 11 a.m. and says that want to order the breakfast menu, why does the person who takes the reservation say it's OK if it isn't? We arrived for our reservation, were given the lunch menu, asked for the breakfast menu, were told that they stop serving breakfast at 11, not given the option, as well as being informed that the kitchen is \"really backed up\". Did that mean that there was only one cook working? Because half the tables were empty. Our waitress couldn't have cared less when we told her that we were told we could order breakfast when we made our reservations. Truly, I could have laid on the floor choking on my own tongue and she probably would have stepped on me to get back to the kitchen. I give you 3 stars, not because of your so-so tart (and the only item available on both breakfast and lunch menus, lucky us!) but because of the carrot cake. My God that was good, so you've got that going for you. But really I could get edible carrot cake anywhere, and don't need to eat it at your restaurant."}
{"text":"Quaint, classy breakfast spot in old town Scottsdale.  Service was great, and the food was even better.  We had the black bean omelette and the fresh berry crepes and both were outstanding.  Go here if you are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I want to be a fan of this location.  The place was cute, enjoyed the decor and ambiance.  However, the services was extremely slow.  Our waitress was not at all attentive.  We had to ask another waitress for our complementary scones, water and even had to check on our food.  I ordered and omelet and it was not hot, not even warm.  Didn't bother to complain as I didn't want to sit there any longer then we already had.  We even had to take our check up to the hostess to pay, since our waitress was MIA."}
{"text":"This place is full of charm & quaint hospitality. I'd been to Arcadia Farms before but it had been a few years. I live an hour away so it's an event to go. They have a CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY BABY CAKE I couldn't stop thinking about. It's worth the drive. I needed a great place to celebrate a girlfriends birthday & I knew this was the place to satisfy our foodie palate. Our meal was delicious from the chicken & mushroom crepes to the chicken & strawberry salad. I'd talked up the chocolate raspberry baby cake to all the girls & couldn't wait to get to dessert. Then the unthinkable happened...... We were told they no longer have the chocolate raspberry cake....... WHAT????? The dessert I dream about, the dessert that brought us all the way from the east valley is no longer on the menu? We were nearly brought to tears! We ordered an apple crisp, baby coconut cake & baby tuxedo cake. All were delicious but for the love of all things chocolate & divine, PLEASE bring back the chocolate raspberry baby cake."}
{"text":"Disclaimer I only had scones, this is not a review of the food, but of the restaurant itself, which we didn't eat at because of such a negative experience we got up and left.

We arrived just before 11am on a Sunday, didn't have a reservation, and were told it would be a 30 minute wait.  There were several open tables.  We were visiting from out of town, not familiar with the restaurant and were not told breakfast stopped at 11.30.  We decided to wait seeing the open tables and many others leaving, as we had an event to be at by 12.30.

We were finally seated at 11.27, and given a mix of breakfast menus and lunch menus.  Upon ordering, we asked if we would be able to be done by 12.30 and were told it was unlikely, it is a small kitchen, it would take at least 45 minutes for our food.  We then tried to order breakfast and were told it was no longer being served.  We asked if they could serve it anyway, and were told no, the kitchen was closed for breakfast.  I informed our server we were given breakfast menus, she apologized and said there was a new hostess.  Another hostess came and informed us we could not have breakfast, if we wanted to eat breakfast we should have had a reservation or come earlier.  I told her we arrived early, to which she said it should have been earlier.

We asked if we could get eggs for my niece, who is 3 because she was so hungry.  They agreed to this, and brought it out quickly along with some complimentary scones.  The server refused to charge us, we informed her we were leaving as we couldn't wait that long for food and wanted breakfast.

If we hadn't wasted 45 minutes to be told we would not be served breakfast we would not have waited.  Arriving at 11am with at least five open tables should have allowed us to be served breakfast.  There was little apology or concern by staff, outside our server not charging us for the eggs.  

Having worked in the industry, I would never put up with staff who treated customers this way.  The hostesses were rude, condescending, non-apologetic, arrogant, and projected an attitude that they didn't care about the customers.

We also observed the party of four behind us have the same experience and get up and leave after waiting 30 minutes to be told they would not be served breakfast.  If we did not have an event to attend I would have asked to speak with the manager, I have never had such a negative experience.  I chose this place to eat based on positive reviews, I am sure the food is outstanding, but I will not risk the treatment to taste it.  I also understand it is a small kitchen, but 45 minutes for entrée's seems ridiculous."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, awesome food. Poorly run, had terrible service and had to ask for another server. I have a sugar allergy and therefor don't eat sugar or grains. The first server told us she didn't know if there was flour in their crepes. Shrugged her shoulders and didn't offer to ask. When I ordered the salmon I asked if it was farmed or wild and she looked at me like I had 2 heads. I asked her what was on it and she pointed at the menu and told me, exactly what it said on the menu. Once I got it there was a honey mustard sauce over it which IT DIDN'T say on the menu, turns out it was natural. I know because I am not on my way to the hospital right now. She's lucky. Our service after that was better. Except after I left the next server 30% tip, I asked her for a tea to go and she never came back with it. Poor attention to detail, my husband also got wrong directions to the restroom. Beautiful location, great valet and outdoor seating but I will take my $$ elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"So, for work, our event today was at the Phoenix Art Museum and we all met for lunch before heading to No Festival Required.
Our table was ready - set for a group of 20.  Luckily, we only had a dozen people.  The table wouldn't have been able to comfortably equip 20, but was great for 12.  Just not enough space for the larger reservation we had made.
I had read the reviews first to see what kind of menu they had.
I opted for the brie and fruit appetizer, along with apricot iced tea.  I'm not HUGE on apricots, but I ended up having my glass refilled twice.  It wasn't too sweet and came with a slice of lemon.  I could have drank a gallon, if not for the fact that I'd be sitting in the theater to see the short films!   What a surprise to have it come - an ENTIRE wheel of brie with some baguette toasts, 2 strawberries and 5 grapes.  Yes, that's all that came with an ENTIRE wheel of brie.  I did ask for extra toasts and got that with no extra charge.  The entree cost $11.  I think that's pretty comparable to going to the market to buy an ENTIRE wheel of brie, fruit, etc.  More fruit would have been nice, though.  I now have a HALF of a wheel of brie in the fridge for later.  :}
Service was super-friendly.  Justin, our server, was great!  
I'd love to come here again with my Mom on a Sunday and check out the rest of the museum."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly slow. Not a good experience. After a while we had to ask who our server was because people whom sat down after us were already served and many workers that walked past us, didn't even look at us. We got placed in the back corner of the restaurant despite our reservation and plenty other open tables. Took 20 minutes just to get a salad. 1: I hate to complain, 2: I hate to waste, 3: I hate to cause problems but, BEWARE the raspberry goat cheese salad with added chicken. The chicken tasted like CRAB of all things. It was like eating a crab/fish salad. After having to flag down our server again I told her about my strange salad and all I got was an \"oh I'm sorry\" while she was still walking past us while I was trying to explain, and she left again. We later had to flag her down for a check as well. I suppose they thought giving us two free cookies made up for the $17-$18 salad that somehow tasted like fish. Used to love this place. Now I'm not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE. A girlfriend of mine said she has been here before and the service was wonderful and the food was as well. So she decided to take me here for lunch for a great experience.  I gave them more than 3 chances to rectify the situation but they did nothing besides give me a Bellini on the house which I could have paid for my own, no problem. First, I ordered a warm brie with caramelized apple appetizer that they served me cold. The waiter indeed took the cold brie and served us a fresh one. But while we were waiting for the warm brie the food runner brought our entrees out and we informed her we still haven't had a chance to enjoy our appetizer and we simply weren't ready for out entree. The food runner had the nerve to ask us \" well what do you want me to do with the food then\", in a very ugly and agitated tone. Then she had the nerve to tell us she will set them aside until we are ready to have them. My friend then tells her well they will be cold by the time we finish our appetite and the food runner agains says well what am I suppose to do and you just ordered salad any way so it doesn't matter if I sit it aside or not. I actually ordered a grilled shrimp salad so I should have had hot fresh grilled shrimp. Which you would think it is her job to figure out what she is gonna do and not ask us how to fix the situation. So my friend very respectfully tells her that she will just have to make us fresh plates unfortunately because our appetizer was not served properly. The food runner rolls her eyes and literally stomps off with the food. I was livid at this point so when my waiter came back to the table I explained to him what had happened and he seems appalled about the situation and said he would talk to her because she should have automatically taken the food back when we told her we were still waiting on out appetizer and that it was common sense we would have fresh dishes prepared. So after the brie came out fresh and I honestly loved it. Actually an amazing appetizer when served properly.The same food runner comes back with our entree and when it comes out it had no dressing at all on it. So instead of trying to come off like I am trying to complain about it I ask her does this dish come with dressing or is it meant to be a dry salad. I asked only because it could be possible they serve it dry MAYBE. So she looks at my salad and clearly see there isn't a drop of dressing on it and sighs and says would you like me to bring you some dressing to put on it. By this time I felt like getting up and walking out but I relaxed and again explained to the waiter what happened with the same food runner he observed my salad and clearly said oh definitely there isn't dressing on it. I then apologize to the waiter because I don't like to be that complaining type customer and he said all the right things and took the salad to go put dressing on it which is what the food runner should have did instead of bringing me dressing to dress my own salad but I explained to the waiter I didn't even want the salad anymore and to forget it. He insisted he would make me something special to compensate for the horrible service I was receiving so I attempted to give him a third try to fix the problem.He then brings me the dish which I didn't get to enjoy because I was so upset from everything that happened I ended up no eating it. So when the bill comes I realized he didn't only charge me for the special dish he made to compensate for the horrible service but he charged me for the shrimp salad I never touched. I was in complete shock and I was so over the whole experience I just gave me friend the money to pay the bill and I walked out. I will definitely NEVER be going there again and if they know whats good for them they should fire that food runner because I'm sure with her attitude I'm not the first customer she has ran off."}
{"text":"Had a gift card, so we stopped in for breakfast while checking out Old Town. The breakfast quesadilla was a good change from the usual omelette offerings. However, the guacamole side was browning a bit. Coffee was just ok. My honey asked for hot sauce which never arrived, and the birds who can't stop begging for food make eating on the patio a little stressful. They will steal food off your plate, so keep an eye out!"}
{"text":"This is one of my places I go every time I am in scottsdale. It's on the best places for a fun leisurely weekend brunch. The salads are off the hook and the mushroom goat cheese quiche was the best I ever had. 

The environment is very cute and makes you feel like you are having brunch in someone's back yard. And the desserts are fantastic, especially the coconut baby cake and the almond croissants!

Definitely try! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This cafe is just perfect! The food was amazing, I had a savory mushroom tart and my partner had a sweet crepe. Both just perfect. Our server Derek was very attentive and personal, we liked him a lot. I highly recommend visiting here and taking some pastries to go! (The scones are perfect)"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here today for my 30th birthday brunch. I made reservations for 10:30 on the patio but wasn't aware that the back patio is closed until October which was kind of upsetting but the hostess let us pick a table on the front patio. After awhile it did get kind of hot and wish we would've ate inside but we still had a nice time.

Our waitress was nice and kept our drinks filled. My friend loved the peach ice tea and I had coffee and it was probably one of the best cup of joes I've had in awhile. I ordered the breakfast quesadilla and it was delicious! Fluffy eyes with sausage, zucchini, peppers, corn, cheese and served with fresh guacamole and salsa. My friend enjoyed her mushroom omelet with potatoes and a side a bacon. Very happy with our meals. 

Can't wait to come back in October when we can sit on the back patio!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely breakfast... tried the crepe, fabulous. Excellent coffee, great atmosphere, lots of seating both in and outdoors.right by old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"First time here and it will not be the last. Nice tasty somewhat healthy food. Interesting options that are healthier than most restaurants. Friendly attentive service food cook to order and nice selection to choose from. Is in an old house and has a unique feel and atmosphere. Definitely worth checking out if you're an old town."}
{"text":"Great we could bring the dogs. Had to sit in front on the street patio, not a big deal. Server brought water out for the dogs which was really nice. We went on a Saturday morning 9:30am. No reservations and got to sit down. After that, went down hill a bit. Our server was hard to track down, food was slow, table next to us said the same thing. We waited over 20 min to pay, they had to find our server. We had breakfast quesadilla and the egg strata. Both were so so. The salsa was really good. Egg Strata was very greasy and hard to eat."}
{"text":"Not that this place NEEDS another stellar review, but I'm going to give them one. While I've had my eyes set on this cute little patio for quite some time, I was finally able to enjoy the full experience with my mom last week. And it most certainly filled all of my expectations and then some.

The venue is impossibly cute. With an abundance of shade and draping ivy over the patio, outside is definitely the way to enjoy breakfast here. The inside was also quaint with plentiful seating options, so I'm sure as the season gets busy with good weather, an indoor table would hardly be disappointing. The menu has so many tempting options, the most difficult part of our meal was choosing what to eat. We both chose eggs for our \"main\" dish, but couldn't pass up the lemon bread pudding with blueberry sauce and creme fraiche. Holy. Mother. of Bread Pudding. I don't know the secret, but this is one of the best edible items my lips have every come across. We ended up taking our eggs to go after splitting the bread pudding because it was so filling AND it would have been a crime to leave one single crumb on the table. The egg dishes were a delightful lunch after our round of golf.

The service was awesome which made for a holistically pleasant breakfast. I can't wait to return for more bread pudding with a side of lunch next time."}
{"text":"We went to Arcadia farms for a birthday party. We had a party of 8 so we called the day before to get a reservation. We arrived a few minutes before for our reservation, and they sat a couple at the only table they could seat our large party at. So we had to wait for the two people they sat at a 10 seat table to finish before we could start. Just felt like a lack of forethought on their part. 

After we were seated we got our orders in then were promptly ignored. The food was actually light and nice. No complaints about any of the food it was all delicious. 

Honestly the food and atmosphere were wonderfully, if give this place a benefit that this was a hiccup of sort and try it again."}
{"text":"This place was really yummy!  My husband & I went for the first time last week, everything tasted so fresh, we got the mushroom/goat cheese omelet.  But the toast... I believe they make their own bread!!!   We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Fabulous lunch w/5 others. Two of us had the Chicken Oriental Salad - it was excellent! One had a sandwich which she said was marvelous. And the desserts!!! The 6 of us shared two: the Tuxedo which was like a Boston Creme w/the most gorgeous frosting! We also had the carrot cake which also was as gorgeous as it was yummy! But the best thing at Arcadia Farm: the venue itself! We sat in the front outside closest to the road but it was never an issue because the vines and other plants form a great block. It was a lunch to remember and I'll absolutely go back again!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant I moved to California 6 months ago and still think about this restaurant often. 

Their service is wonderful, every server I've had here has gone above and beyond to give the best service. Once the server even went across the street to get a dessert for us because they were out in the main kitchen, she even put it together for us. Every experience I have had at this restaurant has been a positive one. 

The food is great also, their brie appetizer is so delicious as is their bruschetta. For entrees I seriously love their chicken and mushroom crepes, it sounds weird but trust me you have to try it. Honestly everything I have ordered their has been good.

When you go you must order the chocolate raspberry cake dessert oh my goodness I could go just for that.

As far as it being for girls only, i don't agree with that the food is made for both sexes and the servers are all female and all hot so what more could you ask for great food and hot servers..."}
{"text":"Poor service and food is overpriced. The food should taste a lot better for what you pay. Also, it's really hard to get a table."}
{"text":"Great outdoor atmosphere with plenty of shade. Wait staff was very attentive, friendly, and gave great recommendations on their menu.

Our brunch consisted of the pulled pork hash, fruit crepes, and the breakfast panini.
All of the dishes were great. Waitress said she felt berry crepes were too sweet in her opinion. We felt they were perfect.

In any case, we loved our brunch experience here and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"First off I tried to make a reservation on Yelp for Sunday at 10:30am. and recieved a notice that first available was 1pm. I decided to call on Sunday after they opened and was able to get a reservation for 10:30am. When we arrived we noticed the restaurant was very quiet with several empty tables. We were seated about 10 minutes and no one had come to our table to even bring water. My husband got up and wen to the hostess stand to ask for water. a few minutes later a waitress came by with water and left saying she'd be back. After about 15 total minutes of being there we were finally waited on. Our food was brought out without delay. We shared a iced pumpkin cookie which was delicious; soft and chewy. Their coffee is very good and it is organic. My husband enjoyed his omelet and my mother enjoyed her scrambled eggs. I ordered the wild mushroom tart and although it was tasty it was barely warm and I asked if it was something that is usually eaten cooled. I was told that it is not and although prepped in advance it is cooked when ordered. It seemed as if mine was cooked about an hour earlier even what was supposed to be melted cheese in top was hard. Our waitress was very nice about it and management took it off our bill.  This was our second time here, we really enjoyed our first visit which was Mother's Day but this visit was just disappointing."}
{"text":"$7.04 - that's all we spent here. Two regular coffees and a giant cookie ($3 cookie - whoa). It was an early December Sunday - rainy, cloudy and cool. We had wandered the Phx Art Museum and now wanted to relax with a cup of hot java. Upon entry, we weren't sure if they were even open. They were for drinks only, considering the museum was to close in the next 45 minutes. We meandered toward the bar and waited for someone to spot us. Soon, we had two steaming hot cups of coffee. Getting fresh cream required a request. Fair enough, I guess. 

We sat outside, somehow managed to find the most dry seats we could. The table still collected rain drops from a previous fall. It was a beautiful garden, especially considering the overcast skies. A family of three wandered by, the little daughter stopping to examine the lights along her pathway. She was a mini explorer, and she was adorable. 

Arcadia Farms Cafe, inside the Phx Art Museum (in case you didn't pick up on that), says it's \"the cafe of choice.\" I'm sure that's true, if you're at the museum, for it's the only cafe of choice. It's not a horrible option, either, if you want to pop in for a cup of coffee, a cookie treat and meandering conversation."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch at 11 am and had a very enjoyable meal. The attitude of the hostesses wasn't as inviting as I would have preferred, but everyone has their off days. They have indoor seating and outdoor, and though it was a perfect day for outdoor, we chose to sit in because there was more comfortable seating.

There were only two things keeping this from being a five-star dining experience. One was the appetizer we chose. Our initial decision came down to two choices: a 'crab and avocado tower' and 'salmon cheesecake.' We went with the tower, which didn't end up looking like a tower at all. It was certainly interesting, but it looked like a Chef Boyardee can had been filled with crab and avocado, then overturned. Once we dug in, it was a solid cylinder of 'meh.'

After a very underwhelming appetizer taste-wise (I knew we should've gotten the salmon cheesecake...) we ordered our dinner. I decided upon the chicken quesadilla. My mates balked at my decision to order a quesadilla when there were so many other options on the menu, but my reasoning was thus: if they are so fancy shmancy, then they'll take something simple like a quesadilla and knock it out of the park.

I was right on the money. I was able to taste the wild mushroom, chicken, and leeks crepe that neighbored my quesadilla, but it didn't compare. The quesadilla and accompanying guacamole was about as good as one could expect to get from a place that doesn't specialize in Mexican food.

If I weren't the type who tries to enjoy all the items on a restaurant's menu, I would definitely order the same thing on a return trip. I had a mimosa and a sangria to wash it down and both were delicious. It ended up being a delicious brunch to kick off what would be an excellent Sunday.

The other thing I didn't really like was our server. She was nice enough, but whenever I declined a suggestion she had made (cookies for desert, for instance) she said, \"okay, just checking on ya.\" She said this multiple times to the point that it became a running gag at our table. It's not really an issue, but it is pestering. This is not my first trip to the rodeo. I know how restaurants work and I understand what a waiter or waitresses' job is, thankyouverymuch.

I will probably return sometime soon. It was very good. Next time I'll sit outside (if it isn't too hot out) and try that salmon cheesecake. Just writing about it is making my mouth water."}
{"text":"I'm torn between a 4 star and 5 star for this place. The food, drinks and atmosphere were all amazing. It's the perfect breakfast, brunch, lunch spot and great when it's a nice day outside to sit on the patio.

We had a couple items from the bakery, a salad, chicken sandwich, and a scoop of the tuna salad....all were great! The service was definitely slow which is the only thing preventing me from giving them 5 stars. It may just be the kind of place that has a more relaxed atmosphere and nothing is a rush. I didn't expect that so I was a bit impatient. Maybe I'll move it up to a 5 star next time knowing that it's a more mellow atmosphere & I should take my time enjoying the amazing food."}
{"text":"The food is always good and love the atmosphere.  The only reason i don't give it a 5star is the servers and workers can be snobby. The server we had this time was great and one of the best we have had but in watching and listening to other servers, management still hasn't addressed this with their workers.  We keep coming back because the food is excellent however, we definitely don't go as often as we used to and I did notice they were quite empty for a Sunday.  They just need to tell their employees to be nice and they would get 5stars."}
{"text":"Been around forever & not even in arcadia, but I gladly drive by lgoNo! Easy to get to & plenty of street pkg. carry on Carolyn..."}
{"text":"Arcadia Farms Cafe is a pretty little restaurant in a great location but a few things prevent me from giving it three or four stars.

Firstly, the fact that it's a breakfast/lunch place that stops serving all breakfast / brunch items at 12pm on weekends (11am during the week) is pretty much a cardinal sin in my book. This is the only restaurant I know of, that's open until 3pm that does this. 

Butters, Eggstasy, Scramble, Butterfields, Daily Dose, Morning Squeeze, etc. all have a similar niche, similar hours and serve all breakfast/brunch food items on the menu until they close at 2:30 or 3pm. I was really, really disappointed to come to Arcadia Farms Cafe at 1pm on a Sunday for brunch only to be told they quit serving it an hour earlier. 

And sadly, they seem to have far more breakfast/brunch items on the menu than they do lunch items, which is confounding. Why have all of your most alluring menu items available for a 3-4 hour time span? Especially on the weekends!

Secondly, I wasn't thrilled with my entrée- which was the vegetable quesadilla. The cheese was sort of gloppy and the vegetables were cut too large to actually stay in the quesadilla. With every bite of the quesadilla, random vegetables kept tumbling out. I wasn't impressed.

My friend and I did split the goat cheese dip and it was actually very, very good. I usually despise goat cheese, but I think they may have mixed it with something else to create this dip, because it was creamy and not as funky tasting as I generally find goat cheese to be.

I also very much enjoyed the white sangria.

If I were to give Arcadia Farms another chance it would be during their (painfully limited) breakfast/brunch window. The lunch menu wasn't impressive or varied enough for me to return for that meal again."}
{"text":"Was able to get seated outside at a roomy table for Father's Day brunch. The scone/pastry provided was moist and delicious. Had the strata and was happy to see large chunks of sausage and vegetables that complimented the dish, and egg was not over cooked! Thank you! Bacon was cooked perfectly. Also samples the savory crepes, very flavorful. Great breakfast."}
{"text":"We visited Arcadia Farms on a recent trip to Scottsdale and it was one of our favorite meals.  We went for breakfast and sat outside on the lovely patio.  Service was friendly and fast and the food, fresh and delicious.  I can't even discuss the strawberry mini scones that were complimentary and served right when we sat down.  I literally still think about them when I'm at sitting at my desk at work.  Wish we had discovered it earlier in our trip!"}
{"text":"Here we go, a five star review.  So, it must stand out to me.  Not that my reviews are the end all be all, but I do like to give props to places that really are top to bottom great restaurants.

Arcadia is one of these.  I can walk here when I'm down to visit my family, so that's a plus.  Fantastic breakfast, brunch, and lunch here, some of the best I've had.  They have a fantastic patio, very private, and even intimate.  Good wine list, lots of menu options, and awesome service.  

Just recently we were there and there was some construction next door.  They were cutting concrete, so you can imagine the noise on the patio.  The manager went over, got the construction foreman and gave him a piece of her mind.  Talk about sticking up for your patio customers.  They halted and we were able to enjoy our brunch.

I'll always recommend this spot to anybody living or traveling to Scottsdale.  Wine lunch?  Yes please."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with my BFF today.

Nowhere to park, forced to valet, meh...

Love the atmosphere here: classy decor, beautiful patio. Everything on the menu looked delicious. I had a hard time choosing between many foods that I love: crab cakes, goat cheese, crepes... I wanted something lighter so I ordered the oriental chicken salad. In the meantime, our drinks were brought to the table. BFF pulled the spoon out of her iced tea to find that there was some leftover peanut butter still on it. The question is: who left it there? Don't know. Gross. This was pointed out to a server (not ours because she had not returned to our table). Our server brought out a new iced tea. She was polite, but not necessarily apologetic. 

When our meal was delivered to the table, BFF pointed out that there were tomatoes on her sandwich (she asked for no tomatoes). The server said that the other server probably grabbed the wrong plate. She came back from the kitchen twice to tell us that the new sandwich would be right out. So, I sat with my salad and waited to eat until BFF got her meal (It took a good 5-10 minutes for her new sandwich to come out). 

BFF raved about the dressing on her side salad. My salad was fine, but nothing to rave about (especially not for $13). The ingredients were fresh but the \"shredded chicken\" that was described on the menu appeared to be sliced chicken breast. To be honest, I prefer shredded chicken which is why I had decided on that particular salad. DISAPPOINTING.

The server arrived at the table to ask if we wanted to order dessert. We replied, \"no, thank you\". And she said something like, \"oh, come on, are you sure?\". Again, we declined but I really think she should have offered us free dessert after our bummer lunch.

The topper? 1 valet guy and 6 people in line to pick up their cars=a 10 minute wait just to leave the place. 

I would hesitate to come back, but that menu is just so damn tempting."}
{"text":"Before the death heat of Arizona set in a few friends of mine and I went here to celebrate a birthday.  We sat outside which was covered, decorated with plants, and gave us a perfect view of the pastry window.  The drink specials all sounded great, but since I didn't want to look like a boozer I decided to only order one.  I chose a champagne and berry drink which was tasty and unassumingly strong.  Since we had a movie to catch we decided to skip the apps and got straight to business.  One of the ladies got the chicken and veggie quesadilla which was HUGE.  The other two got salads which they beamed about and I got the savory crepes that had roasted chicken, creamed leeks, and mushrooms.  The crepes were is a small bath of basil cream sauce that really brought the dish together.  I'm glad that we had a movie to catch, because I might have licked my plate down otherwise."}
{"text":"I just strolled in to see if I could find something for my semi sweet tooth (sweet and savory is more my style) and what a perfect place to get your fix . They have premade salads that looked like they had been made a few minutes prior , sandwiches, other items . The pastry bar was impressive , the cupcakes looked beautiful and everything looked so inviting .  I ordered a fresh squeezed lemonade and a lemon poppy seed Madeline , both were perfect for my fix. I will be back for lunch. 

Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"If you're fed up with men, come here. There are none in sight!

Me and 2 of my friends went to arcadia farms for a caddy 'girls' lunch. I figured this would be the best place to take them after reading these reviews. Welp, I was right!

I made reservations online through open table which made getting a seat not a problem. Very cute inside. Made me feel like I was having a tea party. I felt like I should have worn my sundress :)

The food was delicious. We all agreed. The only sad part about it was I didn't realize my salad would come already dressed for me. My friend got the avacado tower thingy, and the other one got the chinese chicken salad (looked amazing), and I got the vegetable chicken salad. I asked for a to-go box WHEN I ordered it, so I figured I didn't need to ask for the dressing on the side. Wrong. That's where a star comes off. Another downfall was shotty service. You ask for bread, and get it 20 minutes later. They're pretty slow at filling up drinks too. But we were so busy talking and ended up occupying the table for 4 hours, so I'll continue being a fan of them just for not kicking us out :)

We'll be back again when we want to run away from the boys."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere!
Great food!
The spinach omelette was great!
The mushroom tart was unbelievable!!
Wonderful service too
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, and great staff, but somehow I just didn't love anything I ordered!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Waitress tried to take our order before even asking if we wanted a coffee.  She couldn't answer basic questions about the dishes in the menu.  Didn't check up on us after the food came out or top up our coffee.  Food was average but didn't compensate for the brusque middle aged waitress."}
{"text":"Based on prior visits, I scheduled a little lunch here for some friends. We had a reservation and were seated promptly at 11:30am. Before I go further, it was NOT crowded at all. At 11:50 we finally received water and our drink order was given (but never received.) At 11:55 we asked to see a menu for lunch which started at noon. We were told we could either have breakfast or lunch but no combination - that's acceptable, but we wish we'd known that when we were seated. At 12:00 noon our server finally appeared to take our orders and we chose breakfast. I realize everyone has a bad day, but our server was not friendly, helpful, interested in us, or timely. Our food was delivered about 12:15pm. The french toast and the crepes were both quite good (hence the 2-star review) but the breakfast potatoes seemed straight from the can with a red coating and the bread pudding was soggy. No mention of baby cakes or dessert or coffee/tea or the original drink order placed. Service was so sluggish and unfriendly my guests could not believe I had suggested this place. Of course a poor review will not harm your stellar reputation, but I do hope that you'll pay closer attention to the smaller tables visiting your establishment on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"It's the perfect place for brunch. Verey peaceful and beautiful, inside and outside. I always prefer outside tables though it's getting really hot nowadays. Food is good, not great, to my standard, but the atmosphere beats the taste. 

And all the pastries at the market look super duper good too!
Highly recommend for family brunch or casual dating with your love on Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"It is hard to describe this place without using the word 'adorable'. But after eating here I came up with some more- delicious, fresh, and scrumptious.  Service was good even after we moved from an outdoor table to an indoor one due to the heat. This is a beautiful spot and the outdoor areas are lovely. We started with the Brie apple appy- it was exquisite. Two of us ordered the nummy mushroom, spinach and goat cheese tart for a main course. There is a generous side of salad included with this one which I could not finish. Delish! We went to the marketplace after lunch to \"look\" and left with some goodies for later in the day.  They even sell kitchen goods. Everyone goes here more than once!"}
{"text":"This place a joke.  It's pretty clear that they hired some fancy check to create their menu and then he has never touched the place since.  
We came here because I saw the WARM goat cheese salad on the menu.  I'll get to that in a minute. 

To start, my husband's water glass had gobbs of lipstick all over it.  Our server was actually quite friendly and she is the only thing about this place that deserves any stars.  I ordered the warm goat cheese raspberry salad, my friend ordered the caesar with dressing on the side, and my husband got the quesadilla.  

The food came out surprisingly fast but it turns out that was because they forgot to cook it.  The WARM goat cheese was breaded but ice cold.  It had never even glanced at a heat source.  And my salad was completely missing chicken.  My friend's salad was slathered in dressing.  Fortunately my husband's food was at least decent although he wasn't raving about it.  We had to hunt down a random server because we couldn't find ours (she wasn't the person that brought our food) and it also took forever to get my drink refilled.  She sent our food back and yet again it came back with cold goat cheese.  The chicken was also cold and tough.  I had just completely given up at this point and just ate it, except the chicken which was tough and nasty.  

We also noticed that the table next to us received bread which looked quite wonderful but we didn't get any and would have loved to have some.  I even made a comment about them not having bread. 

We were completely disappointed and will never be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I who do lunch dates are starting to try new places that neither has been to.  This was the first stop on our adventure.  
When we arrived at this quaint and inviting establishment we were greeted with a smile and asked where we might like to sit.  The outdoor seating looked nice but since it was the middle of summer we went to one of the indoor areas.  We got the iced tea and the cheese plate to start.  It was a small cheese plate but it was perfect for 2 people to share.  The breads and cheeses were a great combination with the dried fruits and nuts.  I know that jams and honey are sometimes a part of the cheese plate picture but this was a small light taster to start.  The way we lunch is we both order an entree and then split it.  Today We order the Signature Strawberry Chicken Salad and the California Club, minus the avocado stupid allergies.  We informed the waitress that we would be splitting them so when they came out they were already split for us.  The first bite of the salad with that poppyseed dressing was so amazing that we both almost forgot about the rest of the food on our plates.  My salad was close to the potato salad so I accidentally got a taste and remember the rest of the food.  The potato salad is hardy and rich without being to mustardy.  It has bacon but it is not too overpowering and somehow still feels a little lite.  They had forgotten to take the avocado off so they immediately took it back and remade the sandwich.  I loved that you could tell that it was a new sandwich since some places take it back and try to scrape the avocado off when they forget.  They never get it all and so the benadryl comes out but I had no reaction.  The bread was this warm focaccia bread that I could have eaten all day.  The turkey was fresh, not slimy, with crisp bacon.  The meal ended up being too much for one sitting so we both had lunch for the next day.  We ended with the Red Velvet cake which came out looking so cute and tasting divine.  We have already talked about going back and refer people here quite frequently.  It is a little pricey but so worth it."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch/lunch. We had the omelette and the burrito. Service accommodated our timeline - on our way to the airport with only 20 mins for lunch. Wish we could have stayed! Pastries look delicious. Will return."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch with my mom, sister, niece and SIL.  Girls day out.  We were seated outside in the front patio.  The ambiance is great.  So cozy.  

- Crab & Avocado Tower $13.00 - delicious.  Crab was tasty and meshed well with the avocado and salsa.
- Warm Brie with Caramelized Apples $13.00 - How can warm brie and caramelized apples ever be anything but good?
- Strawberry Chicken Salad $14.00 - Was a bit too tart for us. We didn't finish this dish although we've been told it's their most popular salad.
- Chicken, Wild Mushroom and Leek Crepes $15.00 - this was pretty tasty and we gobbled it up.  There was still sauce leftover and we were offered bread to sop up the sauce, but we were too full.
- Wild Mushroom, Spinach and Goat Cheese Tart $14.00 - pretty good but after several bites, it does start to get a little heavy from the goat cheese.
- Warm Grilled Rosemary Ham Sandwich $13.00 - this was probably my most favorite out of everything we shared.  The bread was fresh and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The whole mustard aioli completed the sandwich.  

This place is definitely cute and a perfect place to go with your girlfriends.  It would also be a great place to host a bridal or baby shower.  They also have private rooms across the street and if I remember correctly, a bakery across the street, too.  

Staff overall was friendly, but the hostess who sat us, Polly stood out the most as she was friendly, cheery and informative."}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast, brunch and lunch! The servers are outstanding and really have patience with each guest. They always offer great recommendations if you're stuck between two choices! 
I am absolutely in love with their baby cakes. I personally get the mini coconut baby cake and it is the most delicious cake I've ever had. It's just the right size for 2 if you just want a little something sweet to share, or great to take a few bites and save the rest for later! It's covered in coconut and topped with a sweet strawberry! It's delightful! I take all of my friends here to have great food and wonderful conversation in an lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Old classic in old town ..... really enjoyed it !! Old school dishes and great service!!! Only huge upset was that there was no change table ..... which isnt a problem till its a problem and then its a big problem ;) 
Hope they invest the $20 to get this fixed and become more family friendly ..... but still a big thumbs up to Arcadia Farms"}
{"text":"The spot for ladies who lunch...  need I say more?  Upscale lunch.  Very nice soups, salads, and lunch entrees.  Lovely patio.  Loud and bustling, full of botoxed ladies in tennis attire. You might feel out of place if you don't have a LV handbag, or even worse, you have no idea what I am talking about.  Make reservations.  This place is booked every day."}
{"text":"When looking for a cute patio, nice staff and good food, this is the place.  No soups thought...this place has soup spelled all over the front door, but they don't have any.
Oh well, I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"If you know me, you know that I am a huge fan of Arcadia Farms Marketplace!!  Right when you walk in, your eyes get taken over by the amazing pastry, muffin, and cinnamon roll display that they make fresh and in house.  The restaurant has an elegant french country themed thing goin on but doesn't have the high prices to match (which is a great thing).   
Service seems to always be warm and friendly, the decor of the place is magnificent, and the food is quality.  

I dare you to try......anything. You will be impressed, and this place is still mellow enough to feel like your own little hidden find!"}
{"text":"SO CHARMING! and food is SO DELICIOUS!! Truly farm fresh, I wouldn't be surprised to learn if all of their ingredients came from the farmers market next door. This is a perfect place for a nice dinner party, girls brunch, babyshower, you name it....so cute! 

The shrimp pesto salad is insane!!! And my husband swooned over the crab cakes.... They have an easy read menu...if anyone has a gluten allergy, you should have no problem finding dishes you can eat right on the main menu. 

Service was very friendly..... we were served water in cracked glasses, for some reason the waiter didn't notice at first (nor did we) but we didn't even have to point them out as he gasped when he saw them the next time he returned to wait on us  (and imediatly switched them out) 

I look forward to coming back again and again. :)"}
