{"text":"This place just opened up in the building next to mine downtown and i'm SO glad it did! Hurray for sushi!!!!!

I like this place because they have some of the regular rolls plus some really tasty new ones like fried pieces of yam surrounded with rice and avocado! yum!

They also do bento boxes which are really tasty. They come in vegetarian for the veggies out there!

They make bubble tea and yam fries with spicy mayo!

It gets pretty busy at lunch time since its downtown but they push customers through pretty fast.  The employees are really friendly and the prices are alright for the size of rolls they give you.

I would reccomend this place to anybody looking for sushi downtown."}
{"text":"The lady operating at the cash register under TD Centre is very rude and unhelpful. I asked for my receipt this afternoon, as I need to be able to show a meal receipt as a business expense, but she became irritated and when she pulled the reciept, it was torn in half. She looked at it and saw what she had done but handed me the receipt anyways and when I asked her for the other half, she was more annoyed and then handed me two separate pieces. I asked her if there was a way to get another copy and she didn't bother answering and took the next customer's payment. I stood there hoping she would then return to me after a minute but continued to ignore me while I asked again for another copy. The customers listening were taken aback by her poor attitude and a few of them apologized for her rudeness (they had no reason to) and she never apologized or tried to rectify the situation. 

Mediocre food/establishment whose only real advantage is that they serve food slightly healthier than the fast food close by and the white meat option for teriyaki."}
{"text":"When it comes to fast-food places in The PATH, it only makes sense to compare like-with-like. As such, I was subconsciously comparing Umi Sushi to Sushi Shop in the Exchange Tower and Ho Shim in First Canadian Place when I tried it out today.

I put it slap bang in between both. The sushi pieces are larger and fresher than in Ho Shim, and there's much better variety on offer. The choice and quality of sushi however, is nowhere near as good as what's offered in The Sushi Shop chain.Then again, you'll probably pay much less here - my spicy tuna maki (eight pieces) was $4.99.

The portion sizes were large but badly put together. The rice kept detaching from the fish and not one piece of the eight in the box was bound together well. This made it a bit of a chore to eat. On the plus side, the fish was decently fresh and the spicy mayo mix was by far the spiciest I've ever tried. This was a plus for me, as I like spicy sushi, but for others, it may be a downside. Definitely noticeably spicier here than anywhere else.

Guy at the cash was not pleasant. I was the only one there and the entire transaction was done in silence from his end. Blah.

Good place though - I'll probably be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Tried Umi Sushi Express this week for lunch.  I had the Beef Teryaki Bento box with white rice, salad, 4 rolls, and the yam fries.

The yam fries and chili mayo dip were delicious.  Lightly battered and just the right texture.  The rolls were also very satisfying (I had 3 Avocado and 1 California roll).  And I actually really liked the beef, even though I'm not much of a beef eater.  I noticed it was a bit fatty for my liking, and definitely not the highest quality meet.  But what do you expect for lunch fast food under $10?  The sauce on the beef was tasty and I loved stirring my rice around in it so that I could have some sauce on every bite.  

Overall, a satisfying lunch, and I am sure I will have it again.  Not the highest quality lunch in the PATH, but a good option."}
{"text":"This little Sushi place is so convenient!  Their sushi rolls are made fresh throughout the day.  They have a good selection, mainly california, spicy tuna, salmon, alaskan, dynamite.  There is salmon and shrimp maki, along with edamame and tempura.  They have bubble teas, my taro one turned out to be pretty good, not the best I've had though.  They have a great combo with rice, beef or chicken, veggie tempura and your choice of sushi, it seemed to be a very popular choice.  I have found that the quality of the sushi is always good here, but sometimes it is made better than other times.  They charge 50 cents for extra wasabi.  The prices for sushi are standard.

The service here tends to be good, the food delicious.  This is a great place to grab a quick fix of sushi!"}
{"text":"This take out place at TD Centre usually has a long line-up at lunch.  It has 2 sections, the left hand side Is for ready to be picked up sushi/sashimi/maki box.  The right hand side is for pick your own choice bento box.  It has a small and a large size.

First make up your mind as each slot in the bento box has different choices.  The choices are described by other Yelper in detail.  I usually will pick up the brown rice which is sticky and moist.  Depending on the date will either choose chicken or beef Terriyaki.  If the Edamame is warm, then I like it.  Otherwise, I will choose salad.  There are 4 pieces of shrimp Tempura.  The Dynamite roll is fresh and tasty.

Best of all, the price is very affordable and is considered cheap with all your choices."}
{"text":"Umi Sushi Express is a treat.  I didn't expect such high quality sushi from a mall.  Their prices are very good and I love their crunchy roll.  Umi Sushi Express will custom make your order if you ask.  They also offer a variety of Bubble Teas, which are always fun.  If you need a party solution, you can have UMI make you up what you need to go.  Well worth the trip, but look hard as they are so tiny I almost missed them around the corner from the Chocolate shop."}
{"text":"Sushi good, bubble tea good but witnessed them using mall food trays to place rice rolls on - disgusting!!! 

Everything may taste \"good\" but these workers do not follow sanitary standards our restaurant regulations try to enforce."}
{"text":"Great deal for lunch!

I believe this place opened only a couple of weeks ago. (Especially since I could only find the Simcoe Place location on Yelp!)

I've only been there once because I'm not actually that close to TD Centre, but it was delicious!  A group of us met up for lunch, and all 11 of us got a Bento Box from them. 

Choices to be made for the Bento:
Chicken or Beef Terriyaki
White or Brown Rice
Salad or Edamame
Tempura or Yam Fries
4 pieces to choose from: california roll, avocado roll, cucumber roll, dynamite roll

I had the Chicken on white rice, with Edamame, Yam Fries, and dynamite roll. (My friend got one of each type of roll.)  And the extra bonus was that if you smile nicely to the guy serving you, he loads up the yam fries completely!

So the chicken was a little dry, but still very tasty and very moist.  I would suggest grabbing some of the unagi sauce on the side to make it saucier.  For the yam fries, I highly recommend the spicy mayo to go with it. Rice is rice and edamame was good.

The service was fast and friendly.  I was surprised at how quickly the line moved.  And the price was good too - especially for how much and what you got!

I can't wait till I have a chance to go back!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for a quick lunch! There's usually a long line for the bentos, so I go straight to the \"Express Sushi\". You can just pick up which roll you want to buy and head straight to the register and skip the long line. You can get a roll for $5-$7. And it comes with free miso soup!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place. Had a beef Bento box. The meet was very poor quality. The rolls were really poor. Tempura was very oily. I didn't expect much from a food court sushi place but this place really disappointed."}
{"text":"When you're in the mood for a bento box and work close to Centennial Place like I do Umi Sushi Express is the place to hit up.

They have a special beef or chicken bento box for 8.50$ (around there) that comes with a generous helping of rice, your choice of beef or chicken, edamame beans, california roll (I think) and vegetable tempura.

Cook makes the food fast so that you can tame your hunger, the portions are perfect and by the end of eating it all you wanna lay down on the sofa / bench / chair / sidewalk and just take a long nap.

If you hit up this spot after 2:00pm I believe all the sushi is also 50% off."}
{"text":"Service was good and fast, went at about 1130. Disappointed in food. I ordered a teriyaki chicken rice bowl, the veg was 98% cabbage and 2% carrot, no broccoli etc resulting in little flavour. The chicken was extremely low quality - mostly fat, skin, gristle and even some bone and cartilage - very little actual chicken. Ended up eating around it and throwing out the majority of my food. Probably will not visit again."}
{"text":"Convenient, delicious, fresh, never seems to be a line up when I am there and all topped off with great service. The same friendly guy always seems to be there helping us choose what we should take home that day - he is great!
We tend to get to the Mall later in the evenings which is perfect for picking up our healthy sushi because *after around 8pm or so at Umi Sushi, there is a sign that goes up - buy one, get one free*! Love! So, we end up with double portions to go, enough to feed at least the 2 of us and it helps keep us away from all of the other unhealthy Mall food court choices. 
Love the selection here and the focus on freshness and high quality ingredients. And excellent soy sauce!
If you work in that area I urge you at lunch even to come grab one to go! Easy and fast!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend bought teriyaki and a mango milk tea from this place and it was horrible. I felt so bad that she spent 18$ on a meal, that even with hot sauce, she couldn't enjoy. I traded her my food from another vendor and ate her food myself. OMG, the rice was undercooked, and EVERYTHING had NO FLAVOUR! The mango tea tasted like ice tea and the whole thing was a bad experience. I am happy that I didn't let her eat it, sad that I didn't get to eat my food :("}
{"text":"Umi Sushi is my go-to sushi spot in the PATH (TD food court). You can grab pre-made selections (my favourite is the Kamikaze roll) or order bento boxes which comes with California rolls, tempura, beef or chicken, and salad. 

The sushi also goes on sale after 2pm!"}
{"text":"Had the spicy salmon combo for lunch - I don't recommend.  Sushi was mostly rice and wasn't that good, even for lowered food court standards.  Amount of wasabi and ginger provided was stingy and the pink ginger had a weird stale taste to it.  The free miso soup that came with was bland and I'm not even sure if it had any real miso in it.  

I've had their bento box (hot food) in the past and it's decent, but skip this place if you're just getting sushi.

If you're craving sushi for lunch and the food court is your only option, go to Sushi Shop or even Marche instead."}
{"text":"I don't often venture over to Northland Mall, except if I need something from Walmart and have some time to kill by walking around the mall. There isn't much to look at, and the food court leaves a lot to be desired! Enter Umi, which also has a location in Market Mall, although I don't find it quite as good as here. For fast food sushi it's bomb. I love the variety of rolls, they're all ready to go and always fresh. They also have a wide selection of vegetarian options as well, along with items like tempura, udon soup, and rice bowls. The bento boxes are really good value - 4 rolls, veggie tempura, edamame, and your choice of meat with rice for $8. The bubble tea is also excellent! Service here is fast and friendly. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The sushi was not bad.. It is not the best I've tried. But is not the worst. I would prefer if there is more fish in my roll. Because it was more rice than anything else. But it tasted good. The good thing about this place is the location. And the fact tha it is very easy to go there and grab some sushi if you are in  a rush.."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch in the TD food court. The lineup gets long around 1215 so go early. 

I always get the mini bento with brown rice, either chicken thigh or beef, salad with their dressing, and their vegetable tempura. Quality of food is consistent and tastes decent for $7.90. 

This is my go-to place for food court food."}
{"text":"I've always ordered the Tempura Shrimp Bento Box and over that last few times it hasn't been so great. Prices have gone up in the last year, quality & service has gone down. They need to take some customer service lessons from Thai Express, next store from them."}
{"text":"Their bento box with the beef beef is pretty decent. If you fish around you can look for one with the sushi you like.. hunt hunt.. look for the one with tempura, their best bento combination.

Good to know is you can get cheap sushi after 3pm.. buy one get one free sign.. you can get the cashier to change the sign from buy one get second half price. Yayy for discounts!! Makes the food taste better."}
{"text":"Umi Sushi Express in Northland Village Mall is a little take-out Japanese place.  It has bento boxes that are quite reasonable $7.99 - teriyaki chicken or beef, cooked sushi rolls, salad, rice, tempura and sauce.  What a good deal!

There's also a fridge with lots of freshly made sushi rolls.  We had the termpura rolls and they were yummy!  Very reasonably priced.

They also have sashimi - just ask them - it's not on the menu.

For drinks - they have the usual green tea, pop but they also carry bubble tea.

Take some sushi rolls home for a take-away meal!"}
{"text":"This store sells yesterday's sushi!!! Bad quality, if you want to eat garbage go here."}
