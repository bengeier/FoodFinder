{"text":"This authentic Japanese cuisine was exquisite. Takashi , the owner,  provided special attention to every detail of our meal.  The price was very reasonable but matter what the price we would not have been able to find such good food."}
{"text":"Nice service. Stuffy room.  Food ... drenched in sauce.   The salad was meh and over-dressed. Miso soup was the highlight. Yum!  Beef carpaccio and sushi appetizers were soaking in similar salty teriyaki sauces. What a way to treat delicate foods?  Filet was bland and served on top of, yep, the sauce, maybe thicker. Grilled toro tasted tinny and also over-sauced.   We skipped dessert (yes, that disappointing of a meal) and hit Rue St. Denis for ice cream, a breeze, and people watching.   We were really looking forward to this meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful dinner here while visiting Montreal. It is hidden away on a side street; an escape from the hubbub of St Denis. The food was gorgeous - delicious, beautiful, innovative and very inexpensive for what it is. The space is cozy and pretty with just a few tables. The chef is a true artist and the waiter struck the ideal balance between being unobtrusive and attentive. It's a real gem. My favorite meal in Montreal."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very nice. Small and cozy and the chef was cooking all by him self. The food is very original and creative making our experience a amazing and memorable one. Thanks guys for this night!"}
{"text":"Don't go to this restaurant if you're hungry or on a tight schedule.  The kitchen is super slow. Although the waitress indicated a maximum of 30 minutes for the food to be prepared, it took well over an hour for the food to arrive.  To make matters worse, the waitress forgot to put in my appetizer order.  Make sure the wait staff writes down your order and have them repeat back to you so nothing gets forgotten as it will take an eternity for them to cook it.  Otherwise, the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"You must come on time... this is the warning we get when we rsvp.  At first I thought, the gull this one has to dictate rules and such for a small resto. Then I thought, well this one has to be so good he can permit himself to be capricious, you know, what with prep time for good cuisine and stuff.  Turns out, it's all crap. All this posturing about a japanese chef, hell bent on quality control and making good food, is just fantasy.   Things tend to be too salty, too sweet and tangy or all three at the same time. I'm confused as to what happened in the kitchen when we went because it is not at all what others said about this place.  The only thing good was the plating, everything looked so pretty, but the food is just lacking...too much soy sauce.  Disapointing."}
{"text":"Toroli is a great new gem in the Plateau.  Like its odd name, the menu is a bit unconventional for a Japanese resto as well.  There's no sushi on the menu. Instead it feels more like what you might expect from a casual French restaurant in the heart of Tokyo.  The food is beautifully and meticulously presented.  Sprigs of fresh herbs complement the fresh fish:  The tuna tartare with truffle oil appetizer is incredible!!!  I had the duck for my main dish and it was very good as well.  Desert was also deceptively simple:   Vanilla ice cream served with red bean paste and what can best be described as rice gnocchi.  This basic combination of textures was sublime.  And the green tea selection was overwhelming.  I had a lovely Japanese mecha bud tea which was flavorful and soothing.  My main complaint about this place is that they don't serve wine or sake - it is BYOW now - but the owner told me that they are waiting for a license and are planning do sake tastings!  I can't wait to go back then."}
{"text":"Three of us just had a wonderful dinner here.  Two of us had the base menu, one with the appetizer of the day (a roll with unagi, flying fish roe, and other delights) and miso duck, the other with the miso black cod appetizer (as the other review says, this is absolutely incredible, the flesh is buttery-silky and the flavor so rich) and the sake-steamed yellowtail with mussels (very good), the third of us had the sesame salmon.  The tasting menu of sakes is great, as is the shochu (fun aftertaste).  This restaurant is worth a visit from anywhere."}
{"text":"We totally enjoyed the meal. All of the dishes are very tasty.  We particularly liked the Black cod and the foie gras. Not to mention the prices are so reasonable compared to similar quality restaurants in the SF/Bay Area."}
{"text":"Toroli is a very small (12 people will fill up the restaurant) fine dining experience on Marie-Anne, just East of St-Denis in Montreal. When you eat there, it's like having your own Japanese-born, French-trained chef cooking small miracles for you. For the past 4-5 years, Toroli has been serving Japanese subtlely with French sauces and presentation. Fresh ingredients, vegetables cooked to perfection, mixed rices with a hint of truffle oil and microgreens for color and texture.  Reservations are important on weekends, but during the cold months of winter, you'll often get a table without during week nights. I recommend the black cod or the filet mignon with the five service course."}
{"text":"Divine dining experience.  The food was amazing- combines best of Japanese and French cuisine.  The place is intimate and one feels like dining at chef's kitchen.  Worth the visit from anyone visiting montreal"}
{"text":"Excellent! Top notch chef, amazing flavors. Small cozy restaurant, we were waited on by the chef himself, great wine, the tasting menu was to die for . The highlights were the butter fish, Foie gras, and black sesame ice cream."}
{"text":"I've been to Toroli twice and each time they've impressed!!!  One of the best restaurants that I've ever been to, let alone in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The soup was very tasty. The best Miso I ever tasted. The eel crepe that followed was surprising and very good. The desert was a crisp tasting yuzu and cream tea ice cream. Only the truffled duck magret did not wow us."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, though the ambiance could be a bit better.  This would hit 5* if the prices were a bit more reasonable. But excellent food and nice to go to a Japanese restaurant that doesn't serve sushi. Innovative food and some nice choices. The lamb was tender. The miso soup was good. The salad was extremely flavourful."}
{"text":"Unagi is a must try! We add $5 to change our appetizer to this and my fiancé and me both LOVE it!!"}
{"text":"This is a TINY TINY restaurant!  If you're a tourist looking for it, its off a side street and the wall is painted like a cow (black and white).  Also, make a reservation!  We showed up without one, they were booked but  graciously seated anyway.    That being said, as they say great things come small packages.  There are only about 6 tables total and 3 people working there, 2 waiters and the chef.  The 'kitchen' as some other posters have mentioned is not really a kitchen so to speak, but a small area separated by a long table where you have full view of the chef cooking your food from scratch. The food came out like a work of art and was fantastic.  We tried the duck and the steak and both were delicious.     The staff was super friendly and downright awesome.   I jokingly said to wrap up my leftovers (all that was left was a piece of garnish) and the waitress asked if i would like a bow with that as well.  Needless to say I came home with a takeout tray wrapped in a bow with my leafy garnish!  If I didn't live 6 hours away I would go there all the time.       Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation at 7pm on a Wednesday night for two, and we were one of two tables that night.  Echoing what other people said - I'm VERY surprised that there weren't people lining up out the door for this place. The food was delicious and unique. We had two tasting menus, with duck foie gras and grilled tuna steak. The atmosphere is a homey, clean and intimate, and the service was excellent. We ordered sake and the server would pretty much not let us pour it ourselves. Would definitely come back. :)"}
{"text":"Visiting from the U.S. my wife and I just happened to walk by two nights before we at at Toroli and stopped in our tracks as we glimpsed the entrees on on the table by the window.  Beautifully presented, when we stopped to look the lady at the table smiled at us and rubbed her tummy. We stopped in a reserved a table.  The five course tasting menu offers several choices for each course and everything my wife and I had was delicious and visually stimulating as well. Our server was friendly, very informative and her charm added to our experience greatly, which I have to say is rare for me to say.  The intimacy of only having six tables and one chef/owner means that only 2-3 tables are active at a time. That said, our food all came a great pace and we simply loved Toroli."}
{"text":"I am in love with this restaurant: it is cozy with friendly staff, it has the most magnificent fusion food, and perfect for a date night out. I made a reservation on an evening and it was superb - I came here knowing it would be fusion Japanese food so not expecting anything too traditional, but they were able to combine the Western taste wonderfully into the exquisite delicacy of Japanese food.   The appetizer is really one of a kind and we fell in love with the fresh oyster and the home-made sauce that went with it. The seafood felt alive on your tongue just before it melts lavishly in your mouth. It was amazing. Their main course on the fish and duck are both fresh and portion was perfect. And finishing off with dessert ice cream, it really was a complete delicious meal. I really enjoyed the creativity of the chef and loved every dish. Definitely will return to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Minuscule petit restaurant de 20 places mais de la grande cuisine et superbe exécution. L'ambiance y est sobre et sans flafla et la musique un tout petit peu trop forte sans être dérangeante. L'entrée de sashimi de boeuf au ponzu est brillante et la morue au miso absolument exquise. J'ai hâte d'y retourner pour essayer les plats principaux et les différentes formules en tables d'hôtes."}
{"text":"I can't tell what's happening with the ratings here - I cannot believe a place like this gets this high of a rating. Seems fishy.  After my gf and I did some Tripadvisor + Yelp cross-referencing, we decided to visit Toroli, excited about trying some Japanese/French fusion. The dishes sounded inventive and exciting.  Upon arrival, we were told that we were lucky to get a table because they were fully booked. I eyed the suspicious \"Reserved\" signs placed on each of the handful of tables in the tiny restaurant.  This was a flag to me - who needs to show off they're reserved?  Flag two came when I noticed the two other parties dining at 7pm on a Friday night were tourist as well.  This is some of the worst food I've ever eaten. There was a thick / sticky sweet soy something sauce that drenched 3 out of the 4 courses in our tasting menu that was so graciously suggested by our waitress. Our salad was swimming in the dressing   The main course, my seafood rolls, were definitely cooked from frozen - my eating partner's duck was the same way too.  We didn't even finish our meals, i'd say 95% of the food was left on the plate as I got up in a huff because I felt so ripped off.   Be aware, Tripadviaor and Yelp are very misleading here. I feel there's something fishy happening - save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Two of us tried this place for my birthday. I had 6 tasting course and my friend had 5 tasting course. The food was flavourful and tasty( especially the black cod, I could eat 10 more of them!!) The wait person and the chef were very friendly. I definitely recommend to try this place out to experience great Japanese / French food!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from America and we have dined at many a fine restaurant all over the U.S. This place hangs with the best of our dining experiences.  Small, intimate restaurant. A very approachable but also romantic setting. Unbelievably, they run as a 2 person team on a Friday night. One person as the front house/server, and one as the chef. No sous chef, just one man preparing each dish individually with TLC (tender loving care).  We had a 6 course tasting menu ($65) and the 5 course prix fixe ($46). We came 20 minutes ahead of our reservation so the chef graciously offered us a yellowtail/pesto skewer appetizer that was delicious.  Salad, soup was not just thrown together as I have experienced at many restaurants,   Black cod appetizer was outstanding, one of the best bites of fish we have ever had.  The foie gras/lamb dish was superb. The portions for the tasting menus were very generous.   One reviewer commented on how slow the service was.  It's literally one man doing everything so you should be prepared to wait for your dishes that are so carefully and thoughtfully put together. Our meal lasted approximately 1 hour/45 minutes. We've had tasting menus that have gone over three hours, so all in all, it wasn't that long and frankly, we enjoyed every minute of it.   You should definitely call ahead for reservations as this place seats less than 20 people."}
{"text":"Toroli is a Japanese fusion restaurant that was founded by Midori Pinti, Shiho Kanamaru, and Chef Taka Sakurai back in '10.  This small intimate restaurant only has about 5 or so tables, mostly 2-seaters, so reservations are highly recommended!  I was really excited to try this place out and made reservations weeks in advance.  The hubs and I came here for an early dinner, where I tried their Miso Decadance tasting menu (6-courses with a Masuzake (aperitif; super strong sake), a salad (beets, and it was one of the best beet salads I've had - thinly sliced with a lovely vinaigrette), soup (light-brothed miso and more sweet), Gindara (absolutely delicious piece of cod - it was a lovely mix of salty and sweet, and the taste of miso was not overbearing - super delicious, and the cod was delicate and flaky), Foie Gras (marinated in miso sauce and then pan-fried, this is one of the better foie gras dishes I've had; served with slices of roast duck and brown rice tabouli with a touch of truffle oil - decadent and garlic-y), and a scoop of ice cream (I chose black sesame) or you can opt for a shot of sake; and, the hubs had their Toroli Special tasting menu (5-courses with a salad (beet salad), soup (light-brothed miso and more sweet), omakase (toro, covered with crispy garlic - super delicious), Paradis de la Mer (large California-like rolls that are filled with fish, battered and fried, topped with a rock lobster tempura, drizzled with teriyaki sauce, spicy mayonnaise, and tobiko caviar; the rolls, I wasn't a fan of, but the rock lobster tempura was perfectly cooked and delicious), and a chocolate ice cream (tasted slightly like brownies, I preferred this more than the black sesame).  We also ordered a couple of additional plates: the Hamachi 'Mirin' (yellowtail marinated with sweet cooking rice wine and soy sauce, perfectly grilled - this was pretty delicious - flaky, delicate, and perfectly prepared) and the Filet Mignon (filet mignon served with brown rice and buckwheat tabouli, seasoned vegetables, and a porto reduction sauce - the steak itself was okay, but I preferred the tabouli, as it had a lovely garlic flavor to it).  Service was unbelievable, as Ms. Anju warmly welcomed us, was super informative, and had a lovely sense of humor. You can see Chef Sakurai himself, all preparing each dish meticulously, as each dish came out beautifully-presented and super fresh. For our early anniversary celebration, we also were treated to a lovely chocolate lava cake that was probably one of the best lava cakes we've had - yum!  If you're looking for an intimate, gem of a spot, try Toroli out :D  +beet salad :D +Gindara :D +Hamachi 'Mirin' +Foie Gras :D +chocolate molten lava cake :D +chocolate ice cream +tasting menus offered +Japanese fusion +ask for Ms. Anju :D +Chef Sakurai in action! :D +reservations required! +friendly service! :D"}
{"text":"The 5 of us had a wonderful meal here!  This tiny, intimate restaurant has truly made our night special.  The food was amazing, a perfect combination of Japanese and French cuisines, rich flavors and beautiful presentation!  The portion size was much bigger than other fancy restaurants we've been to; two people from our party couldn't finish the food and brought it home.  Like I told my friends after the meal, coming from Chicago, I could easily find a very nice Japanese restaurant, or a very nice French restaurant, but this was the first time I experienced this unique rendition of both cuisines in such a beautiful harmony, that's something I couldn't find in Chicago.  I will have to go back to Montreal to experience this again soon!"}
{"text":"Way way too salty on every dishes we ordered! So much potential as the reviews were very high and I really enjoy the cozy little Japanese place served with authentic Japanese but the level of saltiness really push me away from returning."}
{"text":"I used to live by this place. I'd walk by almost every day and wonder what the deal with the cow print decor on the outside was without ever stopping to take a look at the menu in the window. Only after reading some Yelp reviews I decided to check it out with a friend who loves both Japanese and French food.  Japanese-French fuzion WOWZA. Seriously. This is one of the best meals I have had in my life. Honestly I can be a bit squeemish about seafood at times but no bother here - too good. We ordered two of the five course tasting menu and shared the results.   To start was a really well put togther and tasty salad, then a lovely miso soup.   Then we were given an appetizer that I will never stop talking about. This dish was essentially a sushi roll, cut into four pieces. But it was fried, so the rice was crunchy, and it was topped with a melange of seafood, I think it was scallops. And topped with a miso sauce. I hesitated to eat my last piece because this dish was so magical. I am drooling just thinking about it.   My friend ordered the lamb and I had a dish called Paradis de la mer. We shared. It was epic. I can't say which I liked better because I can't decide.   Service was fantastic, really personalized. My friend was leaving for Japan in a week and the owner came and gave some suggestions for places to go - he also sent my friend an email days later with even more information. What a hero.   The only small complaint that I could possibly have is that some of the flavours in the dishes were a bit too similar. But it's a damn good flavour - sticky misom soy lovely-ness. But just' sayin'  I loved this place and would reccommend it to anyone looking for something a bit different than the regular. Also people looking for something awesome."}
{"text":"Love it and loved the Sayuri Saki"}
{"text":"Merveilleuse petite place: environ 20 couverts. Un service personnalisé hors pair. Une attention dans les détails toute japonaise. Des plats avec des ingrédients simples, d excellente qualité, avec un mariage d' arômes et d'épices hors du commun. Sûrement un des meilleurs restaurants de Montréal. Courrez lessayer et n'oubliez pas de réserver!"}
{"text":"Another outstanding meal at Toroli. I was the only person in the place 6pm on a Saturday and I can't believe there wasn't a line out the door.  Chef Sakurai plates consistently incredible food with uncomplicated respect for high quality ingredients. Every course in the chef's tasting was near perfect.   The salad is adorned with super fresh vegetables and a sesame dressing that captures the essence of sesame and soy without being overpowering. The soup was a simple broth with some loose Japanese aromatic vegetables and egg. Once again, the flavors were simple but perfectly balanced and elegant.  The black cod is incredible. The execution was perfect. The fish is perfectly tender, flaking apart and nearly tastes like the aquatic version of kerry-gold butter. Truly incredible.   The Foie Gras with duck is two large pieces of miso-marinated foie gras atop 10 ounces of duck breast. The foie gras is without a doubt so much better than other versions I've had. It's fatty, creamy, and lightly accented with the miso marinade. This perfectly balances the flavor profile of a fairly lean duck cut. The textures of the foie gras are elegant. The foie melts atop one's tongue, glistening the duck portions.   Chef finished off with a black sesame/tea ice cream. This is a pleasantly palette cleansing dessert. It's refreshing and the sesame is quite unique for a dessert item. but it works.   All around this was by far my favorite meal while in Montreal. The flavors are simple perfection. There isn't the complexity and layering of flavors prevalent at Boullon Bilk, nor is there the gut bomby-ness of APDC. This meal with leave you perfectly full and happy, having experience a culinary homage to Chef Sakurai's Japanese heritage and French culinary experience."}
{"text":"Possibly the best meal we have ever had!  The food was amazing and the staff were friendly and attentive. We found the saké selection to be the best we've had to pair with such a unique and thoughtful food combinations. Everything was carefully timed to be delivered when we were ready and presented lovely.   The flavors were unique and not like anything we've ever had before. To quote other reviewers, the tastes were so pleasurable we were literally speechless!"}
{"text":"Cute little small Japanese restaurant! You can see the Japanese chef cook in a tiny kitchen. The waitress was a Japanese lady with an English accent ..  she was very polite and friendly. I went with two friends for a birthday dinner. We got the tasting menu and then other stuff from the regular menu and we shared everything.  The tasting menu came wit Miso soup which had vegetables in it. The salad was so good and had pineapple in it. We had tuna two ways (tataki and tartare) and the beef tataki. For the mains we had the filet mignon, the duck and the salmon. The food presentation was very nice! We all said we would come back to this resto because the food was good! In fact there's a foie gras dish I would want to get next time that I didn't get to order because my friends don't eat food gras.  ;)"}
{"text":"What a precious little gem in Montreal! This was our 2nd visit, this time with our 2 grown children, and Toroli did not disappoint.  We had the tiny restaurant to ourselves for most of our meal, and what a treat it was to be able to hear about all of our dishes directly from our host/waiter/chef. I have no idea how he can stay so calm and collected while wearing all the available hats! And yet, it made for the most amazing experience. We went for 4 variants of the tasting menu and everything was cooked to perfection. Main heads up is that this is definitely a leisurely experience. Choose a different day if you have time-constraints. Toroli and its owner/chef deserve being the highlight of your day."}
