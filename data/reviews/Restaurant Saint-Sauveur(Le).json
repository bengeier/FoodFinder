{"text":"The quality of the food was good, but way overpriced, even for a tourist area.  I ordered a Caesar salad \"reinvented\" as described by the menu, though the only reinvention was to flash grill two heads of romaine, and have all of the ingredients separate from each other.  The bacon was scattered alongside the romaine heads, the Parmesan was a thin braid that I ended up crumbling on the heads after I chopped them, and the \"croutons\" were elongated Melba toast-like slices.  It was good when I put it all together, but 18.50$ CAD for a Caesar salad?  My husband's pint of beer was 8.75$ and his fish and chips 18.00$. The fish and chips were good, but the most we have ever paid for fish and chips was $12, maybe $14, and they were no better than any of the other fish and chips we have had in our lives.  The only thing that we had that was reasonably priced was a glass of wine at 10$CAD.  The bill for these four items before tip was 68$CAD, which is way too high."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm getting kinda sleepy, so this is my last review of the night. 

Restaurant Le Saint Sauveur is an awesome place to have a meal. It's in probably one of the 3 most coveted locations in town, at the corner of Principale (Main) and De la Gare (Station). 

I've eaten there quite a few times this summer and the meals that I've had were scrumptious. The 'filet de sole meunière' is really good. They cook it in white wine which gives it fantastic flavour, and it comes with rice pilaff and sautéed veggies. The hamburger steak has lots of flavour and is absolutely delish!

The burgers are absolutely to die for. Thank God I tried them. I was gonna order something else when I saw some other people having these ginormous burgers. I thought to myself...hmm, maybe I should get one? Oooo yeah baby!! Huge, huge delicious burgers that are gonna fill you up. Oh yeah, the onion ring tower is totally awesome. 

The restaurant has big screen tv's, but usually people ignore them. Why? You're in Saint Sauveur, that's why! On hot summer evenings, lots of people come up from Montreal because 'Sauveur is the place to be. 

This is the kind of place to relax and unwind. 5 stars baby! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Busy place yes, service super slow and menu is expensive, food was decent but if you want to wait 1 hour to eat then come here"}
{"text":"This place is Always packed so I thought I would give it a try. I tried their breakfast, the menu is small, not a lot of choice and a little confusing if you want to order an omelette. 

I ordered eggs and bacon. It was a nice plate visually, came with a shot glass of a fruit smoothie and some strange jam that left a bad taste in my mouth. The bacon was paper thin and was tasteless and there were only 2 slices. All in all considering it cost $10.60 before tax and tip, I was expecting a lot more. There is absolutely no value for your money. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because I enjoyed the potatoes au gratin that came with my meal but again it was a small portion. I left this place feeling hungry and somewhat ripped off."}
{"text":"Look Sympa! mais la nourriture ouf! Nous avons commander une soupe à l'oignon gratiné très ordinaire! Ma conjointe un fish and ships  sans gout et les frites était brulé....  Pour 32.$ C'est toujours trop chère quand ce n'est pas vraiment bon!"}
