{"text":"Went in for 30 cent wings. Everyone was friendly and sauce was good. However, server was not knowledgeable nor did he bother to explain the specials. I only found out that I had to order in certain increments (after I ordered a different number) when I heard the other waitress telling the table behind us. Once I got my food, more than I ordered, but hey it was a couple bucks, I was told that I couldn't have a box for what I couldn't eat!  Interesting concept when not at an all you can eat establishment. I will not be going back due to the disorganization and poor service of my waiter:("}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for a while now. Finally broke down and gave it a try. Overall I was satisfied with my experience here. The menu pictures look amazing, it makes It hard to not want to order from here. Of course once I scrolled past the the assortment of subs including different variations of Philly cheesesteaks, I gave in and just had to have one although I originally wanted wings. On the scale of 1-10, I would give the chicken phllly I had here a 7.5. The only things I didn't like was the bread and the chicken they used. The bread felt like it could be fresher or toasted shorter. The chicken used was terrible but I felt I've had better quality pieces at other places. The real winner of this place are the wings! My group order Cajun honey gold and Hot Lemon Pepper and both were amazing! I would highly recommend trying out the rest of the wing flavors they have available"}
{"text":"Brand new place in the Richmond Mall restaurant space next to the Regal Cinemas.  Was taking the family to the movies and thought I would stop in after seeing the latest Hunger Games movie.  Clean and bright interior with big screens on the walls.  Ordered the wings and fries and they were delicious.  Friendly staff and fast service.  Great, convenient place to stop in before or after the movies ... or to root on the Cleveland Cavaliers on their journey to the 2016 NBA Championship!"}
{"text":"Well what I can tell your first hand. I wasn't there long enough to even order I stood inside for exactly 10 mins . no one said anything to me not the cook or the woman in the back I notice a gentleman sitting down inside and he apparently ordered. I could even understand  if someone told me to wait one moment but not even that. I will not be coming back here.EVER!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've seen pics of the food this place serves from their Instagram page, which be looking good! It was only right to come to see if it was as good as it looks. Safe to say, it was good! I went on Wednesday which is there 30 cent wing day with a purchase of a large lemonade. There wings were really good and they have many sauces to choose from. They also have lunch specials from 11am to 2p which is a great deal of $5.99 with different options. I would highly suggest you try this place out."}
{"text":"I heard they have 30c wing on wed so i went to give them a shot they line and wait was terrible so i order my wings and went for a cut next door i cane back 1 hr later and was told my order is still not ready i then waited another 15 min the. I found out that i have to buy a drink with my order. So the minimum amount of wings you can order is 10and you have to buy a drink and the drink is like three dollars so that's the catch I did not think the kitchen is hygienic and the size of the wings was no bigger than 2 inches I would definitely pay more and enjoy good quality food I have not tried anything else"}
{"text":"We took advantage of their thirty cent wing night on Wednesdays.  The decor is fairly weak and is evident that they took over a previous restaurant.  (But that's not something that I really care about.) The hostess and server were friendly, but at times our server was inattentive even though the restaurant was pretty empty.    The chicken wings are tiny, but for thirty cents it's a reasonable price.  The sauces were good -- particularly the fire sauce!  Beers were $1.50 domestic.   Good prices overall.  Food arrived quickly and was hot."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in after a movie at the mall.   Thought we would give it a shot.  We were greeted by a hostess who also served as our waitress.  I tried the Chicken Philly sandwich and my wife ordered a salad. We both wanted to order Iced Tea, but were told they did not serve any.   We both ordered sodas,   but they had a weird taste to them, neither of us drank them.  The fries that came with the sandwich were really very good - the sandwich was good, but not out of this world.   I think the Charles Subs out in the mall food court probably has a better one. The wife seemed to enjoy her salad.  So, all in all were pretty satisfied with the meal.  My criticism, and I hope they take at as constructive, concerns the atmosphere.   It's supposed to be a sports bar and they do have a lot of big screens,   but we were watching a football game in progress while waiting for our food and somebody decided to play some hip-hop on the Juke box which completely drowned out the sound on the TV's.  While we were waiting, there were two individuals that came in and slouched down on a bench seat next to the Juke Box.   One brought in a sandwich from the Subway in the food court and the other brought in a styrofoam take out box from one of the other restaurants in the food court.  They opened them up and ate them while sitting there inside the restaurant.  No one seemed to care that they brought outside food in to eat there.   There were people in other booths and in the billiards room, not eating or drinking anything - just hanging out.    My wife and I wouldn't hesitate to come back to eat the food again - it was Ok,   but if they want to be successful, they really need to make it a place that you feel comfortable going to.  Because we don't feel comfortable going to a place that lets people loiter and just hang out,  I doubt if we will be going back again."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good ,but the service is terrible. There seems to be lack of communication between hosts and servers-as it ALWAYS takes about 15 minutes before I am greeted every time I go. Additionally, my food usually comes out of order instead of altogether (for example, last time I went, I received my wings 20 min before my fries) and it's not surprising (at this point) to expect food whenever the kitchen feels like making your order  (for example, my wings arrived after 45 min, but  a table of people who came in 15 min after me somehow got their food before me). After the last time, I'm never going back. I tried to give it a chance because the food is really good, but it's not worth the hassle and aggravation of ordering it and having to wait for it."}
{"text":"Overall filling.  Great customer service. Call service to tell you your order is ready. Plenty of items to select from. Clean location. Nothing to complain about.  I ordered from the Maple Hts location"}
