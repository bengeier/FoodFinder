{"text":"Good breakfast.  Price is right.  Friendly atmosphere.   The place is clean.  The coffee sucks, but that's okay"}
{"text":"Great little pub. Foods cheap, drinks are good. Atmosphere isn't the best but if your just looking for a place to hang out with friends it's a good time."}
{"text":"Good service, laid back atmosphere with friendly workers. Everything on the menu is cheap as it gets. Good place to go watch sports."}
{"text":"I get it, it's a dive but what place considers mashed potatoes an additional \"a la carte\" item for a hot roast beef sandwich. We have ordered the hot roast beef from here before and received potatoes. Too bad."}
