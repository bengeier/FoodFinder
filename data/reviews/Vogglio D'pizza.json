{"text":"We me and my girlfriend like pizza. We have tried quite a lot of pizza places here in Calgary, we have not found one not one that is good let alone great. As for this pizzeria I have never been so insulted and   ripped off. This pizza was not pizza it was crap the crust if you can call it crust was made from Bisquick the toppings were not full of flavour all I could taste was salt. The only reason I ate this was it took over an hour to deliver this travesty of a pizza and I was hungry. I am shocked amazed at the positive comments. Does anyone have any taste? I called to complain about there  so called pizza and asked them if they would do something about there horrible pizza but I knew the answer before I asked \"no sorry we can do nothing\". Typical all they care about is they have my money you are S.O.L. Lesson learned. This establishment does not need to be here in Calgary. We have decided that we can make better pizza than this so called pizza restaurant. Taste buds beware stay away from this pizza it is absolutely taste less. The rating of one star mean nothing it id the only way to post my review this place sucks.Nuff said."}
{"text":"One of my favourite pizzas in town. Interesting creations. Passionate pie maker. Try the Southern."}
{"text":"I don't know. I came back even though I got a weird $80 credit card charge from them one night in 2009 when I recall paying $20 or so. I ended up getting a full refund, so I was willing to try this place again so I can get another free pizza after I report the discrepancy to my credit card company.

I was told 40 minutes for pickup, I show up after 45, they say they need another 10. K whatever. I get some pie with avocado and n other toppings. And a Hawaiian. The ingredients were good. I suspect they used \"fresh\" (ie: non canned) pineapple. They went really cheap on the cheese. The sauce was alright. The crust I take issue with. The original crust was not  crust. More like thin crispy flat bread. Definitely was not pizza crust. Too crispy. It was like eating a tostada. Tostadas are great, but not when I order a pizza. Meh. Not worth the $30 I paid. And the request for tip on the credit card machine during this pick up transaction was just tacky.

Uptown doesn't really have much for pizza."}
{"text":"More toppings doesn't always mean a better pizza, but I think it does at Vogglio.  They really load it up.  I tried a thin crust Chaparral last night (chorizo sausage, green peppers, mushrooms, oregano).  It was covered in sausage and was all the better for it.

I'll probably try a more unique set of toppings next time, but I don't think this place is getting by on offering interesting pizza, because the traditional one I had was great."}
{"text":"Voggio, along with Pizza Bob's, is the absolute best pizza in Calgary.  Fresh high-quality ingredients with a traditional thin-crust.

Try a thin-crust pizza with bacon, spicy chorizo sausage, prunes, pineapple, jalapenos and fresh tomato.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I bring catering into work very often and this used to be a go to pizza place for us.  The toppings were creative and overall they did make good pies and I would say they are works of art not just food.

The last time I ordered (and it probably will forever be the last time I ordered) was a bit of a gong show. 

We had 8 (maybe 10?) huge pizzas delivered.  We get a call from the guy I know as the owner (no confirmation) that has personally delivered to us dozens of times. Often enough that he probably should remember my DETAILED delivery instructions and if not remember them his memory should be triggered when he is on route.  He's never been late or lost before either. 

He calls us and tells us where he is - which is BLOCKS away from where we are .  I try to guide him to our location but he sounds flustered and upset and says he's not driving anywhere else and we have to come meet him.    Sooooo 3 of us set out on foot trying to find our pizzas.  We find him and he's irate and starts to yell at us because as we waited for us to walk 10+ minutes to find out delivery guy he had a run in with parking.   He decided to park his car in the middle of an intersection and got a ticket -  a $100+ ticket. He starts yelling at us to pay his ticket which was rather unacceptable. There is illegal parking and then there is what he did -  100% of his car was blocking a major intersection to the point cars wouldn't have been able to pass and he's mad for getting caught ( I know this because he hadn't moved his car when we got there and the parking guys were already gone).   Ironically we walked by parking spaces that wouldn't have gotten him this ticket had he just chilled out and listen to my navigation.   Anyway, he's so mad he doesn't even take my payment info and asks me to call the store later in the afternoon and we walk the 8-10 XL pizza back to our office (MAN are those heavy!).   Lucky for him I'm honest and I agreed to spend 20 minutes tracking him down to pay for food we long consumed.  AANNNDDD  I tipped him to the maximum amount I can expense because I felt bad about the ticket and that covered much of it.... even though he didn't deserve a tip at all honestly and I didn't tell him to park in such a crazy way.  On top of it all, by the time we ate they weren't to their normal standard and kind of cold due to the walking around with them I wager... so it really sealed in a bad experience. 

I realize we caught a usually nice guy on a VERY bad day but it left a very bad impression on me and it's now been years without a return visit.  

I would still recommend the pizza to people though - even if I likely will never come back.   Give the dessert pizza a go (guava with cheese) because it's very different and I quite liked it (to a degree - I can't eat a lot of it though!)."}
{"text":"First off, this place isn't Mexican, it's Columbian (as the large number of Columbian flags would probably indicate).

This tiny mom and pop (literally a husband and wife team) pizza place serves some of the best and unique pizza in town. ex. the Fruit Fiesta.

There's also solid more traditonal choices as well.

The most important thing about Vogglio D'Pizza is the crust. Know what you want. There's everything from paper thin New York style thin crust to brick like thick crust.

The thick crust usually only takes one to two slices to fill most people and is great for a moving party.

Since it's a two person operation be prepared to wait a little longer than usual. ex. if they say it will be ready in 25 minutes, it will actually be ready in 35. but the quality and unique choices make it worth it."}
{"text":"Unusual flavours, fresh pizza and three different kinds of crusts, you can't go wrong at Vogglio. 

I walked in for a Friday night treat. Fernando recommended I try the Mexicana. After I agreed to order a small, he adds \" you can get one more for 50% off\" with a little wink. How could I resist? The Fantasia got added onto my order.

Fernando told me to come back in 25 minutes to get my pizza. He took down my cell just in case. 30 minutes later my phone rings \"Wendy, it's more than 25 minutes. Your pizzas are ready!\" A reminder to make sure I get 'em while they're fresh-now that's service.

Two small thin crust pizzas for around $25. The Mexicana was delicious. I think I might go without the shrimp on The Fantasia next time. Either way, Fernando, you've got a pizza fan in me."}
{"text":"I heard great things about Vogglio, for example \"it is the best pizza in Calgary\".  However, my hopes were too high and I was let down. While it was a perfectly good pizza, it was nothing special.  I would never go out of my way to go get a slice."}
