{"text":"I was visiting Montreal and I went to Bis with my boyfriend and three friends. We thought that it was going to be the nicest dinner of the entire weekend and we were appaled at how bad it was. The appetizers were delicious - baked eggplant, burrata with tomatoes, and the house salad. The Chianti we got was great too, but we only ordered Chianti, because there was no Pinot Noir left in the entire restaurant. I had never heard of such a thing until I dined at Bis.   We were very excited for our entrees. I ordered the linguine with clams, mussels, lobster, and scallops. The two clams, two mussels, and one scallop were edible, but the lobster was so overcooked it was inedible. I was surprised at how much lobster you get with the dish, and I was excited to dive in and eat it. I couldn't even eat it. I gave a huge part of the tail to my boyfriend (I wouldn't usually do this if I liked it) and he ate some. I also gave some to my friend, and he spit it out of his mouth.   My one friend loved her veal dish and my other two friends order the pork chop SPECIAL stuffed with cheese and prosciutto and they simply could not eat it. No one came over to ask how the meal was until the end of the meal when we all pushed our plates into the center of the table. The manager walked over and asked why they weren't eating the pork chop, and we told them that it was over cooked and the prosciutto was tough and rubbery. I told him that the lobster was overcooked and he told me I had eaten it all and he didn't believe me even though there was some leftover on the plate (and WHO leaves leftover lobster when it's delicious?). It was very unsettling that he was questioning me and thought I was lying about HATING my meal.   After we complained, all the manager did was tell the waiter to order us drinks on the house. We just wanted to get out of the restaurant at this point. No one came over to take our drink over for the next 15 minutes. Finally our waiter came over and asked us if we wanted limoncello... but we thought we got to order our own drink?!   Overall, the entire dinner was a disaster. Who knows how George Clooney frequents that place. We'll never go back to Bis."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here with my husband. Fantastic food from start to finish. the staff were amazing and I cant say more about the meal. Loved it. True quality food, service and a beautiful dining experience."}
{"text":"Very good Restaurant. My wife an I had a delicious buffalo mozzarella and a pasta with lamb stew. The staff was very friendly and it was a gorgeous evening in this restaurant. We can recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The stuffed mushrooms were okay. The service was slow and we had to ask our waiter for more water. The main dish was good, it was a spicy shrimp pasta."}
{"text":"We arrived in Montreal on a Monday night and walked from the fashionable St. Catherine's shopping area to this pretty restaurant. The June evening was perfect so we chose to eat outdoors on their separate patio. Though there were only six tables, we had trouble keeping the attention of our waiter. When he came to take drink orders and I asked a question about the menu, he answered and then left without taking our drink order. This sort of service continued throughout our meal and was disconcerting.  The owner was put and about and another waiter brought us out entrees, but none of the three seemed to be our primary host. The food was delicious-- my husband had risotto lim one with shrimp and I  had a nice living with mushrooms and dried tomatoes---but we felt very uncared for, I'm sorry to say."}
{"text":"Excellent meal with excellent service! Amazing cocktails! Loved the Harvey Spector and the Key Lime martini."}
{"text":"We came to Montreal for our anniversary weekend and were told Bis would be the perfect place for a quiet, romantic dinner. A gorgeous Italian restaurant tucked away in the middle of downtown Montreal! The host offered us complimentary champagne and really took care of us from the minute we walked in. The food was great. The scallops and veal meatballs starters were both delicious. My husband ordered the filet mignon and I ordered the grilled shrimp. Both were amazing with great strong flavors and generous servings. As good as the food as Bis was, the exceptional service really made our dinner memorable."}
{"text":"From start to finish this place has got its sh.... Together from Paolo to the owner Aldo  and the other server  who's name I don't know  Food is spot on and there are not many places that serve veal meatballs as a free starter. Then to finish the meal with walnuts and biscotti  Made the night  Im from New York and they can learn from this place  Thanks again for a great evening."}
{"text":"I love this place! So romantic! The dishes are great?Especially the red wine they recommended."}
{"text":"Just wanted to take a quick moment to review Bis.  Best meal we had on our vacation.  The food was simply delicious.  We started with a simple salad that was so fresh and satisfying.  Perfectly dressed and balanced. you know those salads that seem so simple yet you wonder what did they do to make it taste like that? I had a pasta dish and my husband had a veal dish.  Both were so yummy!!  Eat here, you won't be sorry!!  The service was really good and the owner is close at hand which is always a good thing.  I want to say one more thing. I noticed that someone gave this restaurant one star, the same dates we were in Montreal because of a situation they had over a reservation.  I think that is so unfair.  If you had a disagreement, no need to give one star to bring a fine establishment's rating down on yelp."}
{"text":"Selected Bis based on location (hotel is less than one block away) and prior Yelp/Trip Advisor reviews. Was fortunate to get in without a reservation on a Saturday night, getting their last free table at 6:15pm.   Just after we were seated an unexpected amuse-bouche was delivered, and as good as they were they were still nowhere near the star of the meal. Started with the Caesar salad, which was excellently prepared. For main courses we went with the tagliolini ragu d'agneau (lamb meat sauce) and the veal saltimbocca. Both were superb, but for my tastes the lamb ragu pasta was simply out of this world -- one of the best pasta dishes I have ever enjoyed.  Service was prompt & professional. I'd guess the fact that they were planning on turning our table over kept the service attentive, but at the same time we were never treated abruptly nor did I feel rushed.  I do wish their wine-by-the-glass options were slightly larger, but given that I highly enjoyed the Multipulciano that is a (very) minor quibble.  And in the end, I can only say that I hope that I get a return visit some day to Montreal, and a chance to enjoy Bis another evening."}
{"text":"If you're looking to spend some money in Montr√©al, give Bis a try. Bottom line: the food was great. The only personal complaint I had about it was I felt that my gnocchi was slightly over cooked, but I am personally very hard to impress with that dish.   However it bears special mention that any minor complaint I had about the food was completely made up for with honest and excellent service. The staff was very attentive and the pacing of service was excellent.   It was also great to see the owner working very hard on the floor and chatting with guests.   Great place to impress if you're on business or on a date."}
{"text":"The meatballs that come out first are delicious. I'm sure the food will also be great. However, I won't be back! I find it ridiculous to be scolded like a child over a reservation we had. This is not an inexpensive restaurant, and one would expect them to have supreme customer service to match their pricing and food. The host was overly condescending and quite RUDE! Our group has traveled all over the world and made reservations in multiple restaurants and never had a situation like this. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Located right next door to Europea, this place did not disappoint us. We walked in before five so were fortunate to get a table without reservation. I ordered short rib risotto that was not on the menu for that day. Slow cooked rib was so tender and juicy. The creamy risotto was seasoned just right. Great service and very relaxing environment."}
{"text":"My wife and I are vacationing in Montreal.  She's from  San Francisco and knows good veal which is hard to find in Los Angeles, and I love to cook. While cabbing in to town Sunday evening from our airport arrival, we passed by Bis on the way to our Hotel at the Ritz Carlton.  We both love Italian and figured this might be a nice alternative to the French bistro leaning environs. The crowd at this indoor-outdoor restaurant was all the convincing we needed.  Sunday we dined at a seafood Bistro which was lovely, Monday at Bis.  In a word, spectacular. My wife craves good veal and loves truffles, so she opted for the veal in truffle cream sauce..  To quote her, it was \"orgasmic, and the best dinner shed'd had in years\". She raved all night, including to the owner Aldo, who graced our outside table with several visits to chat. My pasta di mare was loaded with clams, mussels, shrimp and a whole split Maine Lobster served over al dente angel hair  pasta in a light red sauce,, equally spectacular. Desert of profiteroles, and ice cream served avogato (expresso slowly drizzled over a scoop) was all perecto!  Dinner was so good we have canceled a fancy restaurant reservation and will return later in the week so ny Mrs.  can have her veal again not withstanding so many other wonderful sounding items on the menu. Stay tuned for the the update, although we fear not.  Upon our return to our hotel, the Concierge asked how it was and advised many other recent diners had also raved."}
{"text":"Went here for a work dinner on a Wednesday night.  It's located very close to the Bell Centre, and there was a hockey game that night, so it was quite busy.  Also parking was difficult to find, so I valet parked my car there.  Had I known it was going to be $25, I might have circled the block a few more times but oh well.  The decor is upscale rustic Italian, but seems a little dated and tired.  Service was efficeint and professional but a little brusque.  There was an amuse bouche of a mediocre veal meatball.  I had the stuffed portobellos as a starter, which were quite tasty but lacked in presentation somewhat.  For the main course, I had the poached codfish, which was on the bland side and slightly overcooked, a real pet peeve that I have with fish.  The bread basket was excellent, with several selections of delicious and fresh bread.  We had a very nice bottle of Barolo with the meal as well.  I skipped dessert but had a slighly watery latte to end the meal.  I wouldn't say that I had a bad meal here, but for the price point (over $50 before the wine) there are just so many better places to eat in Montreal."}
{"text":"Bis is an outstanding find in Montreal.Small ( maybe 15 tables), intimate, and food of the highest quality.One of the co-owners,Marcello, makes sure your evening is an enjoyable one."}
{"text":"Where to start?    We showed up and got the crazy idea to start as the only 2 brave souls on the outside (sidewalk patio) ... ordered wine and appetizee .. we/staff noticed that it was little chilly ... the waiter attempted to turn on the gas heater and was unsuceessful and apeared to give up ... that's when the manager (Marcelo) walked out and took over ... I am not exaggerating but he pulled up a chair and worked on the damn gas furnace for 15 minutes relentlessly until he finally got it working ... then I saw him ask the waiter to roll it over to our table which was in the middle of the patio .. the waiter was hesitant but he insisted .. and bam .. the heater was on our side ... twice I reached to pour wine for my beautiful date and the waiter ran over to take it away from me insisting that I was as \"Bis to relax\" .. the second time it was a different waiter and he stopped almost mid sentence while talking to the next table as he noticed out of the corner of his eyes that I reached for the wine ... he later told me that the manager was watching ... good service begins with a great manager (Mr. Marcelo) and dedicated staff ... after appetizers we moved inside to a great cozy ambiance and AMAZING food ... can't ask for more ... great service, cozy ambiance and attention to detail ... great job... see you again .."}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in were greeted by very friendly and professional staff.   The atmosphere was cozy and quite pleasing. We started with perfectly made vodka martinis, followed by a carpaccio and  caprice salad, both which were small but good. I had the vegetable risotto which was okay (a bit watery with little bits of vegetables, but tasty), and my husband had the seared tuna over arugula which was very good. Excellent service and great food. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit tr√®s bonne cuisine vraiment l'endroit parfait pour manger parfait  accueil tr√®s chaleureux on peut rencontrer des c√©l√©brit√©s parfois."}
{"text":"What I had: Veal meatballs Lamb Ragu Calamari   Summary: Food - excellent Service-excellent  Decor-good would be great if they did not have silly wood panels with lights on the walls. Overall-highly recommended  Came for dinner the hostess was very friendly and nice. Before taking the order they brought a spoon with two little veal meatballs on it, they were really good, moist, flavorful and the tomato sauce they came in was great as well. We ordered calamari as our appetizer and it was fresh and the batter was light but a little bland. This was the low point of the meal.  I ordered lamb ragu as my main course and it was superb, really flavorful and perfectly cooked.  The staff was super attentive and could not have been better and friendlier. Patronage was mostly families with the odd older couples thrown in. Overall I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of the most Fabulous resteraunts in Montreal!! Our maps were delectable and the manager was such a delight giving us LemoncelloA must try for sure and it will NOT disappoint"}
{"text":"What a great find in Montreal. In a city filled with French food, this place is amazing.  Quaint, great atmosphere and remarkable personal service. Spend the extra dough and try it. If you like fine Italian dining, you have to try this ristorante."}
{"text":"Made a reservation 2 weeks upfront with YP.Dine, got confirmation. Came on time and the restaurant was closed. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the concierge at my hotel. Fantastic experience!  The manager/owner was very engaged and came round several times to make sure we had everything we needed. I had the carbonara which was great and authentic. Wine list had great variety. Thanks for the hospitality and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"A nice, quiet restaurant. We got a plate of calamari (crispy, not rubbery at all, very good), linguine with tomato sauce and oyster mushrooms (strong, fragrant mushroom flavour) and carbonara (rich cream sauce, but a bit too salty). Both pastas had good flavour but were a tad bit overcooked. But whatever, no big deal.   Service was good except the servers were kind of hovering over us, making us feel quite uncomfortable. It was a slow evening so I guess they were kind of bored and looking for things to do, but it was very weird and awkward to have someone stare at me eat. How do you tell a server to stop staring...?"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, 5 stars for that (most imortant) aspect of our visit. Our service on the other hand left a bad taste in our mouths. Although it was a busy night, all tables around us were doted upon, while my wife and I were virtually ignored for the majority of our visit.  We truly could not understand why we were treated differently...we were dressed appropriately (unlike many of the other guests), we made a reservation, and we ordered more than our share off of the menu. Regardless, we sat for nearly an hour after dessert without acknowledgement, we were never told the night's specials, and when we asked for the check it took another 20 minutes.  This night must have been an exception, as the other reviews pointed out the service as one of the hallmarks of Bis. However, our experience was bad enough that I felt obligated to post this review, and I typically never feel the need to post bad reviews! Better luck to all in your visits to Bis, we likely won't return."}
{"text":"Bis is a hidden Italian gem in Montreal!  My husband and I stumbled upon Bis by chance while touring the city and we were in awe!  The food is delectable and the service is above par.  We look forward to dining here again on our next visit."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended Bis to us and after reading reviews on Yelp I knew I had to try it. Service was excellent. Food was unbelievable. We had the minestrone soup - very light and full of flavor. We also tried an antipasto appetizer with fresh mozzarella, stuffed mushroom, fig wrapped in prosciutto and a marinated seafood salad. For main courses we had the linguini pescatora, veal chop and veal osso bucco. All were out of this world. The osso bucco was so tender I could cut it with my fork. Saffron risotto came with it and was very good. We asked for the linguini pescatora to be made white instead of red and they made a deliciously light sauce that wasn't overpowering in any way. The veal chop was cooked perfectly and very tender. The only thing I would recommend is if you don't like your veal very peppery they went very heavy on course black pepper seasoning - this seemed like something they were in the process of changing to allow the diner to season themselves. Dessert was delicious. The lemon granite was so refreshing. The tartufo was great. The Sicilian cannoli rivals cannoli I've actually eaten in Sicily. So fresh and crispy! The owner was very nice and he went around to all of the tables to check on everyone. He was very personable and attentive. Great experience and I can't wait to return to Montreal again so I can pay Bis another visit!"}
{"text":"The service staff is amazing, the food was very good, I really enjoyed the nice atmosphere. I'm not a cheap person but 2 entrees & Main dish cost us over $115.00 without buying a bottle of wine.  I find this place too expensive for the food, if you are on a date and the lady wants to be impressed that you bought her an expensive meal well this is the right me. For me it was over priced, especially for Pasta Prima Vera.  The Vegetarian options were not really vegetarian they were seafood which they consider to be vegetarian.  Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and the flesh of any other animal)."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and the food. We had the lobster, the gnocchi and the rice balls and stuffed portobello mushrooms, and to end profiteroles. It was all delicious and a great experience."}
{"text":"We enjoy going there! Food, service and customer care to its best! Thank you for making us feel like home at all time with your warm welcoming presence!"}
{"text":"Went to Bis on Valentines with my close friend. Right away I fell in love with the restaurant, when you enter there is a coat check, which is nice during winter time. We were greeted by the owner, who was very friendly, he sat us down at our table.   I enjoyed te setting as the tables were big enough yet still cozy, it had a good amount of space between each table so you don't feel squeezed in.  Our waiter was super friendly and polite, he told us the specials and gave us time to decided.   To start us of, the restaurant offers two bites of small meatballs in marinera sauce, which was really delicious. After we made our choices they brought us a variety of breads in a basket.  Our appetizers were a plate with different selection of antipasto, which included calamari, caprese salad, prosciutto wrapped around a fig topped with some balsamic vinegar. We also ordered arugula salad which plating was beautiful, basically they had friend the parmigiana into a basket shaped and filled it with arugula topped with balsamic vinegar.  The friend parmigiana wasn't my favorite but I enjoyed everything else specially the calamari which was crunchy on the outside yet super soft in the inside.   Our main meals were what our waiter had recommended, lamb chops, and lamb shank filled with cheese. Both dishes were amazing, meat was cooked perfectly, moist and seasoned to perfection. Even the side vegetables were tasty.  After such a wonderful meal we had to order dessert, tiramisu and cannolis. Both made fresh, I enjoyed both deserts but preferred the cannolis more.   Last but not least we had ordered coffee and they had brought us some biscotti, even that was really good, it had raisin and I liked to so much that I told the owner how great the biscotti was, he went in the kitchen and gave us bunch to bring home. What amazing service.  The owner was truly a sweetheart, he went to every table to make sure everything was to the guests liking, our waiter Marcello was superb, very knowledgeable, kind, and a perfect service.  A restaurant that I had never been too but will definitely be coming back.  Make sure to reserve in advance"}
{"text":"Tr√®s bons, services attentionn√©s et rapides. Seul point n√©gatif: extr√™mement bruyant."}
{"text":"The server really recommended the lobster linguini and he ended up bringing out a pasta with no lobster on it because they \"ran out.\" Thanks for the heads up? Really disappointed"}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant. Nice location, ambiance, very good food, great service. Still, perhaps somewhat too expensive. Just a bit though. It is just that, for such a price, I would want the food to be out of this world, and it was just very good."}
{"text":"J'ai pris les p√¢tes aux crevettes et p√©toncles et mon ami celui aux palourdes. Nous avons vraiment appr√©ci√© notre repas dans ce petit lieu o√π il est bon de bien para√Ætre.

D√©licieux dessert malgr√© que la torta √©tait peut √™tre trop sucr√© √† mon go√ªt et je me plains rarement en mati√®re de sucre :) attention facture sal√©e en tous les cas mais g√¢tez vous ou votre ch√©ri (e)!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always have had a great time.  Both the food and service are fantastic.  Staff is very friendly and accommodating, and I try to go every time I make it to Montreal."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a colleague who is Italian. We both agreed it was one of the best meals we've had in the past few years. I had the gnocchi which is my favorite Italian dish. It was top 2 or 3 I've ever had. Overall service was outstanding and our server was  fun and energetic. Great overall experience!"}
{"text":"The food was GREAT!  and the environment is very nice.  You should really dress up if you are going to eat here.  or at least better than usual.  I cam here while I was traveling and so I looked like crap.  When I walked in the customers were looking at me like \"wtf?\""}
{"text":"Amazing food great service  absolutely delicious. Authentic Italian food, the best we ever tasted. We had the gnocchi and veal, soup salad you name it, all of it is delicious."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding as was the food. Soft shell crab was done tempura style. Nice starter. Osso bucco was tender and the sauce divine. Veal piccata was done perfectly. Peach cake was tasty. Marcelo and staff were interactive and helpful. Nice extra touches like veal meatballs and walnuts as starters and finishers were appreciated. Lovely evening many thanks"}
{"text":"Just had dinner with my dad at Ristorante Bis, which came recommended to us by our hotel concierge AND American Express...my thoughts:  Ambiance - Small but cozy. Jennifer Aniston came in just as we were leaving which was a nice surprise.  Service - Top notch! Everyone at this restaurant was friendly and happy and tried to accommodate every request.  Food - Just okay unfortunately.   The restaurant was very concerned about accommodating allergies so I had no doubts that my striped bass special would be dairy-free as promised. Unfortunately the plate came with polenta which had dairy in it AND on it, and luckily I noticed before taking a bite. Ultimately the bass was dry and nothing special for CAD 37.  My dad had a pasta which was CAD 28, again nothing special.  The complimentary bread was good, and they gave us complimentary biscotti for dessert, which was very generous of them.  Overall I'd give this restaurant a 3/5 if it wasn't for the amazing service. Maybe we just ordered wrong? We might give it another try if in the area again."}
{"text":"Good food but overall had a very unpleasant experience. The most unwelcoming, non-friendly, snobby, and rude main server. We were a group of 10 people celebrating a very special occasion but we all left feeling unhappy due to extremely poor customer service. Unfortunately it ruined our whole night! Some staff were better than others but our main server did not once smile nor did he introduce himself. They brought out a completely wrong dish and when we informed them we had ordered something else, they first tried to argue with us that there was no such a dish on the menu. When we asked for the menu back and proved them wrong then they argued again, saying we pointed at at the wrong thing and they had misunderstood us because of that. Oh, so they do in fact have the dish in the menu right? WHAT!? This kind of service is completely unacceptable especially for the price you pay here. I would never go back or recommend it for anyone. DISAPPOINTING!"}
