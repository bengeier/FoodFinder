{"text":"A family run popular traditional trattoria in Bellagio. This has to be one of the most sought out restaurants in Bellagio, no bookings are taken but a queue of customers end up sat outside on cushions waiting for tables!! 
Great value home cooked Italian food with amazing homemade pastas, locally caught fish and the most delicious desserts imaginable. We've eaten here four times on two short visits to Bellagio, and would of eaten here again bar too long a wait for a free table on one occasion. It's a small restaurant with a few outside tables which have blankets ready to use on cold nights(as well as the cushions which get used for waiting customers too!). Definitely worth the wait but ideally best to arrive pre opening time and getting to the front of the queue. Open every day but Tuesday."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Friendly, prompt service. Good menu with wide range of northern Italian cuisine. Food was outstanding. Very fresh. Prices very reasonable. House tiramisu was excellent. Highly recommend. We ate early so there was no wait but we heard it fills up later. Some tourists mixed in with locals."}
{"text":"Absolutely  excellent ravioli! Best in Italy so far. 30 eur for 2 pastas and .75l house wine.
INSIDE TIP.
Grab a glass of wine and a pillow from the restaurant (they provide) and sit on the picturesque steps looking down the alley. There is always a number of couples just sitting and enjoying the location, not even waiting for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Trois étoiles parce que cette trattoria est sûrement l'un des moins pire Resto de la commune..tout est trop touristique!les plats sont basiques et sans goût réel. 
Le seul côté positif est le fait que les plats sont maison."}
{"text":"A very popular place in Bellagio,if you do not have a reservation you had better be that at 7pm sharp for a chance of getting a table.This restaurant has been in the family for 40 years and all of the desert recipes come from the owners mother who was actually dining there with other family members.As soon as my wife told our server about her allergies he called over the owner he asked my wife about her allergies and then made recommendations of what she could eat.He kept coming by thru the night to check on us and make small talk,his English was excellent.Food was was very very good,I had veal ragout very tasty , my wife had fresh lake fish right out of Como Lake again excellent.I was checking out my bowl of tirimisu and the owner came by again and said What's wrong,I said nothing I'm just checking it out.Then to our surprise he brought me a piece of chocolate torte no charge and said try this and tell me what you think.It was fantastic and of course we got into talk about how it was made. Great Great place if your in Bellagio you have to go there."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the Veal Osso Bucco at this restaurant. This was the only subpar meal I had during the entire 11 day trip my wife and some friends took in Italy. When the dish arrived at the table the veal looked dried out and was served over a lifeless slab of polenta. The sauce had good color and hints of great taste, but overall the meal looked like it had been prepared a day or two before and just reheated. My wife and friends had somewhat better meals and looking around at other tables I saw some amazing looking dishes so I was extremely disappointed with my meal."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after hearing a lot of good reviews from various sources. Was lucky enough to get seated immediately. Saw other people arrive later with longer waits. Was seated inside but really toasty and would suggest waiting for outdoor seating if it's been a warm day. Ordered the pasta pommodoro which was a bit ordinary in terms of ingredients but good with regards to freshness of pasta and flavorful. Others enjoyed specials which they liked. Also noted a lot of people ordering fish which looked real good and was deboned prior to eating by staff. Anyway, good place to go if you're in bellagio...."}
{"text":"A favorite of locals and tourists. Go early. They don't take reservations and it's very popular. If there is a wait, they will equip you with a glass of wine and a cushion to wait for your table on the picturesque steps. Food is great and taste like it was made my the Italian grandma you see buzzing around the place."}
{"text":"This is a great little trattoria on one of the busier walkways from the lower level to the upper level of the town.  All the reviews ward of busy times, but as it was raining this day, there were no concerns for a wait.  One of the specialties was a boiled rice and perch, which was fine, but the stew of the day was wild boar with polenta and this was outstanding.  The richness of the flavors came across from the first smells and was extended through the sauce and the meat and I wiped my plate clean with some bits of bread.  The local wine Sforzato was an excellent complement."}
{"text":"A perfect meal - arugula salad, vegetable soup with a perfect rich broth, al dente homemade fettuccine Pomodoro with a rich tomato sauce and chicken cacciatore with the meat falling off the bone. The service was professionally and warm. But what truly topped off the meal was the absolute best tiramisu either one of us has ever had in our lives. Get it - it's worth every calorie!!!!"}
{"text":"The best meal we had in Bellagio.  The linguine with porcini mushrooms was excellent. The atmosphere was comfortable and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I was so excited to visit the real Bellagio besides the Las Vegas version. I didn't realize there was lots and lots of hills with in this lake town but I think it was fun walking around up and down looking at all the different stores and restaurants. 

Searching for that special dining experience, we've came across Trattoria San Giacomo in this picturesque town. Being a party of 5, they were quick to seat us and take our drink order. I loved looking at the artwork and pictures on the walls. Our food was delish! We ordered fresh fish from the lake, spaghetti and others that satisfied us. Besides the food, it was nice sitting from our table and people watching. The experience was worth the expensive meal."}
{"text":"This is a very wholesome ,hearty , well priced, staff friendly, good food restaurant.
Good atmosphere
The specials of the day were great, the best minestrone soup I've had for years!
A must when visiting Bellagio."}
