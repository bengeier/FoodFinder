{"text":"I've heard about Brothers for years but didn't make it there until tonight and now I can't wait to go back. The service was good and the food was much more than I expected. We shared the arugula salad (WHAT do they do to make it so good????), shrimp tacos (really good) and slider trio and were happy w everything we ordered. The music was great (we stayed on the wine bar side) and I definitely would recommend"}
{"text":"Be careful. Someone slipped a drug into my boyfrirnd's beer. Before he finished his second beer he said I have to go. He missed one step outside, fell to his knees, I got him home and he slept for 36 hours. He has no recollection of  what happened.  We were in the wine bar which is a small room and he was never more than ten feet from me.  Obviously, we will never go back there again. Too bad as we always considered it our neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Such a fun place!  No matter what kind of music mood you are in this place is great!! Flatbread was good too!!"}
{"text":"Oh man this place is awesome! The floor plan is unique-pub/wine bar/concert hall all under one roof! The bartenders are sexy and friendly and the food is plate licking good. Best damn burgers in Cleveland hands down. They have live music every night, usually 2 different kinds- one in the wine bar that's usually more mellow and then rockin out in the concert hall. Seriously, check it out!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love paying $4 for a beer? In all seriousness, this place is great! The prices are a bit high but I would rather pay a few extra dollars so I don't have to deal with the college crowd down the street.  Brothers Lounge was remodeled a few years ago and let me tell you the craftsmanship is awesome. The dark wood and subtle mood lighting make this the perfect place to grab a beer after work or party with friends on a Friday or Saturday night. Their staff is pleasant and they are always willing to help you in your spirit selection.  I bet you were wondering about the food, huh? Well let me tell you I have eaten a variety of their food and it is all delicious. My cholesterol doesn't think it is but I do. Everything from wings to steak, it is all good. On Tuesday evenings they have some really good sushi and it is well worth the price.  Mix great food, strong drinks and live music and you certainly will have me coming back. Brothers Lounge continues to be one of my most treasured local joints. Get here and enjoy all it has to offer."}
{"text":"always enjoy the atmosphere. great sandwich and beer selection. if you enjoy live music, brother's is the best place to go."}
{"text":"I adore the Brothers lounge!! But just a couple tweeks; first is clean better; esp. Restroom. Food very good and hopefully clean kitchen. (Sorry...) Next is double check  SOUND in wine bar; way loud on a couple occasions; people leaving... (the atmosphere is especially nice in wine bar so keep that lighting low..)"}
{"text":"Wow, did they ever pour the cash into this place! We went last weekend, and there were lines out the door. There are three separate rooms, each with its' own full bar. The first thing I was struck by was the age group of the clientele. It was Saturday night; we got there about 9:40. Most people were in the 40-60 demographic. Which, frankly, I am, too. Shouldn't we all have been home in bed? NO! We were at Brothers. I was told that Brothers was big in the 60's and 70's, then closed down for many years. They did a grand remodeling on it, and there's a lot going on. When you walk in, there is a huge bar with very comfy bar stools (thanks for the BACKS on the stools, Bro!) and other seating, mostly for two, along the opposite wall. The room behind the main bar is huge, and would make an ideal spot for a private party. The night we were there, a live band was playing, and there was a separate cover charge for that room. They had a stage, lighting, and quite a sound system. To the East of the main bar, there is another large room (which I hear is actually a wine bar) with bigger tables and a stage set-up that could accommodate a jazz combo quite easily. We didn't try the food (menu looks limited to some very standard bar fare, but, really, who's eating?) It was a lot of fun, it was jammed with people. We left around 1:00 and it was still going strong. The only complaint I had was the noise level. It was one of those places where you had to cup your hands next to the other person's ear and shout to communicate. My ears were ringing when we left. That's why I didn't bestow five stars on the place."}
{"text":"Good food and ok prices. Great atmosphere. Wish portion sizes were larger, but then maybe these are what real portion sizes are supposed to be. The house wine wasn't good at all. Live music was fantastic and the best part of the wine bar."}
{"text":"I really like Brother's.  Have been here 3 or 4 times now.  It is better when it is less busy, like on a weeknight, because the service is naturally quicker.  They always have a variety of live music.  With three different bars (front bar, wine bar, back bar where the large stage is), you can always escape to the more quiet one if you want to talk.  My bf always raves about the bar back who works here.  Just watch him sometime, he actually is incredible.  He is fast as hell and actually rotates the beers in the cooler and front-faces them.  So you can see what beers are there and you know they are actually fresh.  Such a basic concept but tell me the last time you saw someone at a bar rotating their stock.  The crowd is typically older than most bars, which is good, in my opinion.  However, if you are 21 and just looking to get lit on shots, you might want to pick somewhere else."}
{"text":"Well this is the lowest rating I've ever given a restaurant in Cleveland.   We were in the wine bar section on a Thursday evening.  We were told that we were not regulars and prime seats are reserved for regulars.  The restaurant was understaffed and the waitress was rude.  The level of unprofessional service was pretty bad.  The food was excellent I had a Caesar salad with chicken and got a house cab.  My impression is this is the kind of place that doesn't welcome new customers or walk ins they don't recognize."}
{"text":"We were a bit confused on the set up, but figured it out.  Went into the wine bar to eat and take in the guitar player.  Great seating, maybe a little too dark toward the back.  Music didn't start till 7:00 so check what you are looking for here.  Menu was small, with only 3 entrees and a fair amount of sandwiches and small plates.  I ended up with the Fried Lobster Mac and Cheese.  Also did hummus and mussels at our table.  Hummus was good and portion was ample for the table.  The mussels were fantastic, with a base made up of tomatoes and sausage.  You will need all of the bread to soak up the broth.  Very good.  The Mac and Cheese comes out in two squares on top of each other.  Started eating and it was a little tough and dry.  Then I crushed it all up (like you are supposed to) and it was fantastic.  Very rich.  I am a big eater and I had to ask for a take home box.  $19 was a fair price for this entr√©e.  Others got the spare rib sandwich and the arugula salad which were all good.  The homemade chips were seasoned with something in line with Maui potato chips.  Should have ordered those for an appetizer.  Drinks were standard and plenty of choice.  The Bloody Mary type of martini was great for me, but way to hot for the women.    Music in the concert venue sounded great, but not enough seating.  Had someone who needed to sit so we couldn't go in.  Band was great from what we heard and it looked cool in there. I would go back"}
{"text":"Thought the ambiance was a little underwhelming and not much direction or \"service\" throughout my time at this place. Wings we had were good and the group that performed was \" ok\". Expected a lot based on word of mouth. Wouldn't recommend to go or stay away. It's average for a jazz type feel, specially for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Great venue for live music, and a wonderful bar and kitchen. However,, tonight the joint smells like a fryer. And, I ordered a glass of the house cab off the menu. It was listed at $6.50, but I guess the waitress wanted to make sure she got her tip, as she charges me $7.00 for it. Not sure where they get off on the bait and switch. Live music would have been a good excuse, but not when I pay a cover.   On a positive note, the cab was really, really good. Made by Storypoint, 2015."}
{"text":"I got to see a pretty accomplished jazz trio at Brothers Lounge last month, and was thoroughly impressed with the great interior, acoustics, drink selection, and ambience.  The trio played in the east room \"wine bar\", which is particularly great for nighttime entertainment when they turn the lights down, but you can still see people walking by the enormous bay window in front of the building.  I play in a jazz quartet myself, and am hoping to someday land a gig there, this is the kind of place for jazz aficianados!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night to catch Mike Farrell's comedy show.  As a venue, Brothers is great.  It is like a mini Improv with exposed brick walls and spacious back room.  Bar service was really great.  Bavarian pretzels get 2 thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"Been feeling a little spontaneous the past couple of weeks and decided to check out the weekly events at brothers lounge. Walking in- you have your average rusty town bar. Walking in through the second doors is where you have your stage and pretty spacious room for events. The Tuesday comedy show was decent. You get what you pay for- $5 and you'll get to giggle and a variety of comedians take turns telling jokes. This night they have specials on sushi and I was quite hesitant on ordering this at a bar but it was actually pretty good. Came here the following week for jazz night and absolutely loved it. I love jazz and just hearing the band play was amazing. Granted, I've never been to a jazz club so I guess I don't have anything to compare it to. Monday nights are 50 cent wings and they were amazing! I have the garlic Parmesan and my friend had the glazed ones and I couldn't get enough. In its entirety, I can see why people head to brothers lounge for events, it's the perfect place to get out of the house in the winter and be entertained with the variety of events they have going on."}
{"text":"Excellent venue, nice ambiance, however the service was horrible. The waitress was pissed because we brought in a party of 20 even after letting them know. She was pissed because she had more paying customers!!! Would love to come here again with a better staff! Horrible, would not recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"2 stars because of the service. Otherwise it is a 1. Great service. Terrible food. I would be emberrased to send the dishes out of the kitchen if I was a chef. Place needs a new chef. They serve denny's quality food and charge a 5 star restaurant pricing. Seriously.  Either improve your food quality and stop screwing  people out of their money or get out of business. I have never ate at a place that ruined my mood. Terrible."}
{"text":"I only go to Brother's Lounge on Monday nights.  Monday night is Mojo Generations Big Band.  Cover is $7, band starts at 8pm, and you can't beat it for 3 hours of solid big band sounds.  Sometimes the back room is so crowded there is only standing room only.  Other times there are plenty of seats.  You can get there early and order something to eat (the food always looks good, even if I haven't tried it.).  There is a full bar with table service.  Occasionally you will see people get up and dance.  I'd love to see more of this on less-busy evenings.    I highly recommend checking Mojo Mondays out at Brothers.  You'll be sure to have a swinging good time!"}
{"text":"I can say onething but the Brothers Lounge Rocks!!!Its to me the best Music Venue on the Westside of Cleveland.The food is good but the beer prices are high but what do you expect for a place of its caliber.The wine Bar has a good selection of wine and the beer selection is off the chain....The food is very good too and it priced right.I will say the Brothers Lounge is a good place to go for the music and vibe."}
{"text":"This  is such an amazing establishment with live music and good food."}
{"text":"Everything from my previous five star reviews still applies. Every time we go here the guys I am usually with all have to get the Left Coast sandwich. I got the lobster salad rolls last time and they were amazing. As were the fries that came with them. Also Guy Fieri just happened to stop in for a bite!"}
{"text":"Brothers is pretty sweet. They really did a number on this place.   I'd like to see more of a selection, band wise, and that's why they're losing a star here. This would be the perfect place to showcase some of Cleveland's finest and I just don't see it happening here. I suppose they just want to keep the riff-raff (people like me) out so they book mostly cover bands to cater to the mom-jeans-wearing, non-trouble making, one-glass-of-White-Zinfandel-and-I'm-tipsy types.   Their food seems to be pretty decent. I had the Cajun Blue Sliders and they were very tasty. (Sorry, I'm not going to go into their texture and all of that boring food nerd crap). They were just good, okay?   I was semi-satisfied with their beer selection....until the bartender thought he was talking to a beer newb. I wanted an Allagash White. They were out. He recommended a Blue Moon and said they were \"comparable\". No way, buddy. I went with a Roquefort 8 -- tasted like it had been in their fridge for too long -- but still tasty. (It's not pretentious or boring to talk about beer in this way. Nope, not at all).   Alright, I'll get off my high horse. I like Brothers, despite its minor flaws. Check it out."}
{"text":"Such a cool place. I had never been there before but its the Trifecta of al watering holes. Theres a bar, a concert hall and a wine bar all in one. The locals are pretty friendly and you don't feel like you're in a 'Cleveland' bar."}
{"text":"spend time on either the beer side or the wine side depending on your mood, lots of live music in the back area as well. Very busy during concerts, especially during the summer months when the sort-of-patio (smokers' lounge essentially) is open as well"}
{"text":"I love the Brothers!  Seriously, one of my more favorite places to hang. I've seen a few shows in the back theater and I'm always impressed by the sound system and pro stage. This place was built for music. I agree that they could use a bit more variety as far as bands go though.  The wine bar is cozy and the food is pretty decent. On my last visit, I had the Wedge Salad with chicken. Really good. I also enjoyed the Mac n Cheese.  I like that there are multiple separate areas. Pub, wine bar, music theater. Something for everyone! The patio kicks ass too. The money used to renovate this place was well spent."}
{"text":"The new menu at this place is delicious!!!  Better edamame than most Asian restaurants could pull off.  I'm so happy to see the shift in menu- i want to try everyting!  I highly recommend the roasted nuts and the left coast sammy.  Mmm!"}
{"text":"Great food. Amazing drink selection. Live entertainment is usually an option too if you want to catch a show."}
{"text":"Pro's: They do get some great live music Food, beer, and drink prices aren't crazy expensive  Cons: PARKING is a BITCH Food isn't the greatest and portions are small Too many tables for certain shows. Sometime it gets so packed because there are way too many tables with people just sitting and not eating. Their cover charges for events are ridiculous for sub par cover bands. If you want to pay $8 for a very bad 80's party band then you will like this place.  Thursday night is supposed to be Jam night with the Bad Boys of Blues. From my experience with jam nights they are supposed to be free forum, no judgement, if someone wants to come and jam let them come, sign the list, and get the person up there. Well that's not how its done here. They Bad Boys play favorites with regulars. They scratch people off lists if they don't know you. I understand they are popular and they get the biggest turn out, but if someone comes repeatedly every week for years, don't you think they can sit a week out so they can let someone else get a chance? Politics of the whole thing suck. Its supposed to be a jam night, but you might as well get there at 5:00 if you want to be first to sign the list, and if its your first time, forget about it, they'll rush through a song and get you off so their regulars can get up."}
{"text":"Decided to come here while my daughter was at a concert down the road.  Well, I should clarify... I never just happen upon a place- I scope/Yelp it out!  After looking into other options, I picked Brothers, mostly becuase of its location to the concert.  I was immediately impressed with their private parking lot & was even more impressed with the interior. I thought the lighting, woodwork and ambiance were wonderful & tasteful.  Our service was great, too.  I don't recall what I ordered because nothing on the menu looks familiar so it must have been a special.  I think it was polenta and it was pretty good.  I remember not getting much for the price, but liked the atmosphere.  There was a nice variety on the menu so I think there is something for everyone.   Connected to the restaurant is the wine bar, which seemed a little more upscale & quiet.  We had some apps in the bar & then went to the main venue and listened to some guy talk about Bob Marley.  Not a Marley fan, but it was interesting & I am glad I went.  I would recommend this gem to anyone looking for some new entertainment.  I will be keeping my eye out on their calendar!"}
{"text":"Came for the first time, seems nice and relaxf I l here.  Crowd looks good, casual laid back people.  I like it here so far.  They got a bar and food here along with music and live bands."}
{"text":"I always find myself coming back here on a regular basis for the beer selection, food, and great music most nights.  What other bar in Cleveland can boast three separate bar areas, two different concert venues, a variety of live music nearly every night of the week (with two different shows at a time), and a kitchen that tops the regular bar fare anywhere else?  If you haven't been to Brothers yet, GO!"}
{"text":"This is a pub/lounge/music hall where one almost always meets or sees interesting people.  Beer, Wine, and Liquor Selection pretty decent and above average.  There are two music halls, one in the wine bar and the main stage.  There is also a back patio.  There are good food specials most nights of the week.  Every week there are blues and jazz jams as well as the in house jazz band(the Mojo Big Band).  Very well suited for Semi casual night out or weekend night fun."}
{"text":"Always good food great Wine Bar good selection smart and courteous staff one of the best places to go to watch a good event and have some good food"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of live entertainment, you will be a fan of this place.  PROS  *The cool, rocky-jazzy atmosphere. When you walk into Brothers, you think you are walking into just another hole-in-the wall pub. A bunch of bar tops, dim lighting, kind of grungy...all in all, it appears to be nothing special. Then you notice two sets of doors. One opens up to a large, open music hall with a stage made for rocking out. The other door opens up to a cozy little wine bar area. The night we went, we spent the majority of our night in the wine bar listening to the open mic night. So chill, so creative, so coming back for more.  *The music. I am not really a fan of loud, can't-talk-over-it, kind of music. They do have this here in the back room, but since it's not my scene, I chose to spend my time in the two other rooms. My favorite was the wine bar where they had open mic night. I was in awe of the musicians that came in as strangers, but meshed together to create beautiful, soulful music.   CONS  *3-star food. I got three tacos--two fish, one pulled pork. They weren't terrible, but they weren't very filling.   BOTTOM LINE  Pick a room and enjoy the atmosphere, music, entertainment and a few drinks!"}
{"text":"Great music venue with variety.  Nice balance between casual and upscale.  Friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"They have the most delicious boneless wings on Monday nights! By far my favorite weekly food special for wings! Try the buffalo and the garlic flavors especially! Only 35c a wing!   Their other food selections are very good and the atmosphere is wonderful. The  Mediterranean flatbread is delicious!   Service is always extremely friendly and courteous. This is a great spot to just chill and hang with friends. Also they have great live music shows in the back room, and the wine bar area is also a nice cozy spot!"}
{"text":"I'm rating strictly on the food.  The burger, supposedly one of their most popular dishes, is not very good. Mine was overcooked while my friend's wasn't. So they're inconsistent. Their portobello sandwich was REALLY bad - I couldn't eat more than one bite (and I can usually eat everything because I hate wasting food). SO SALTY. The fries, my friends said, were underseasoned. The corn chowder soup was mediocre as well and really heavy. I heard there's a new cook and was warned by the waitress not to order some dishes because they were not good. We ordered based on her recommendations and it still sucked. I just felt kind of gross after that meal that even the live music and cheap drinks couldn't redeem it."}
{"text":"I knew this place was trouble when I first walked up to the bar for the first time ever, the bartender looks at me and says \"bourbon' not as a question. They make a mean libation here from Manhattans to Martinis. The food is also really delicious and not terribly expensive. You can choose from 3 different ambiances, we ended up there during a solo artist set where she sang the lesbian rock, but she was so good we stayed."}
{"text":"Great place. I definitely recommend it. They usually have a free band and a band for a small cover. Fair price on drinks. Wide selections of beer and wine."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with an amazing atmosphere.  Gidget is amazing an made me feel at home.  Thanks so much! Oh and the food!?!  I'm a picky eater and I'm in love! Yes, in love!  It taste as good as it looks or better"}
{"text":"We were passing through Cleveland and stayed near this lil gem of a place. Was a Friday night and there was live music in the wine bar and a disco band playing in the back. We chose the wine bar; the music was enjoyable and the suggested wine delicious. They also served Guinness for my husband. Costs were reasonable.  Good atmosphere, filled with locals, good drinks and music. Exactly what's needed on a road trip.  Will definitely go back if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Seriously a really cool spot but the food was quite awful. The waitress said a new chef was just hired who changed a lot of the favorite dishes on the menu. I ordered a chicken chowder soup which actually wasn't too bad- very creamy but I like that. The portobello sandwich was almost inedible due to the amount of salt or vinegar in the sauce. The drinks were sub par and beers listed on tap weren't even available."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Every restaurant in Cleveland should serve Lake Erie Perch. Brothers does and it's delicious. We sat at the bar for lunch. Friendly bartender. Decent selection of bottled beer. Dortmunder on tap. This place is a triple-threat. Full bar, wine bar and Live stage. High-top seating in the back for live music. Great seating in the wine bar... leather, soft backed chairs and a small stage with a piano and drum set. A cool, clean, place... worth a trip for lunch. I'd like to head back for some live music and drinks for sure."}
{"text":"Was recently introduced to this bar, which I never took much notice of because of the area.  I learned they serve sushi on Monday nights, and not only do they just serve it, it's actually GOOD sushi! On the west side we don't have a lot of options, and am so happy to have learned about this place! Wish they served it more than one day a week. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I first went to Brothers to go watch a wedding band play. It was my first time there and I didn't know what to expect.   I walked through the front door, went through a narrow bar, through two double doors and was welcomed by a stage, high tops, and a whole bar too!   We thought it was just going to be bar food but boy were we wrong. Everything down to the chips was so delicious. We only got apps while we listened to the band play but we later went back for food at another visit and we were so in shock we hadn't heard of this place sooner.   The atmosphere is so fun, the typical crowd ranges in age which makes it very enjoyable too, and the food is such a surprise and delicious!  This is a great place for a fun night out, especially with all the nights they have live music! I highly recommend brothers lounge!"}
{"text":"One of the coolest places in a city known for uncool places. Live rock, blues, and jazz.  A sophisticated wine bar, music hall, and front lounge. Front bar is small and gets crowded quickly. Sometimes custoemrs can get a little rowdy on weekends, but nothing serious. Mostly young professionals and neighborhood residents who like the atmosphere letting their hair down. Small but good menu. The Bavarian pretzels, however, were not that good- didn't really taste like pretzels but whole grain soft bread sticks. Otherwise, a fun place and tasty food. Not cheap, but prices need to be somewhat pricey to keep some of the trashy types from the neighborhood out."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with Brothers. The interior was nice and  the staff was friendly enough. I went there on on Wednesday night, just a handful of others there. Sat down at a table right away. Ordered the veggie flatbread, delicious! I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Normally when someone goes above and beyond customer service, I not only write an excellent review I also send a written letter addressed to the manager via snail mail. I'm not just talking restaurants here.   I've gotten poor service and poor food so many times in restaurants I give up on writing a review. However, if \"I\" don't say something, how will an establishment improve?  I have been in the industry for 40+ years and have served in all positions in the hospitality industry. I graduated with honors from the San Diego Culinary Institute but have also waited tables, hostessed, bar-tended for more years than I can count, and have bused and done dishes.  I went to Brother's Lounge tonight to listen to some country music in the wine bar, ordered sushi and then asked the bartender Christina about the eggplant caprese. She said it was one of her favorites, so I ordered it.   The eggplant was way over-deep fried to the point it was black around the edges, When she asked how my food was I told her! I didn't want to wait another half-hour for another order since I was nearly half-way through it by then.   Nothing was done about it, no manager came over, and I was given my bill. When I left I looked for a manager in the main bar, not only wasn't there a manager, there was NO ONE behind the bar, and two employees were sitting on the front steps when I walked out smoking cigarettes,   I WON'T be back. What has happened to customer service these days?"}
{"text":"I've been twice, both times in the back room.  The first was for happy hour and the front bar was full.  We got a couple of fun martinis but there wasn't really much going on back there so it was a bit awkward.   The second time I was there was for a comedy show with a few bigger names of local comics.  It was a good time.  Bartenders were quick even though each high top table was full as was the bar.  Glows from candlelight made for a nice ambiance.  Comics were funny, and some not so funny.     I'd like to check it out the other rooms.  I like the idea of the different areas all in the same establishment and try more food than just an app.  For now, it's 4 stars."}
{"text":"I would consider this a neighborhood bar.  But I can see people from outside the area coming here because there are many good things about it.   The atmosphere is  in no way pretentious.  Yet it is a bit more upscale than your average neighborhood bar. Service was really good. Always new when to come by and check our beers. The menu had some nice regular selections you get at a bar. And then some other items like Asian shrimp tacos. Very good. Only problem was, the shells were really chewy and hard to bite thru. Someone else said the same thing.  Are they microwaving them? That changes the texture of food.  Wings were oh so tender and hit the spot.  Nice beer tap selections.  And good bottle choices.  It was not a rip off price-wise.   One of the things I liked was the music room in the back of the bar with doors to go thru. So, as a patron you had a choice to listen to music or hang out at the bar and converse without screaming.  This is a classy joint!"}
{"text":"Friendly. Eclectic. Diverse. Tasty.  I had a limited experience (and by limited, I mean I was at the bar).  Did taste the beers during happy hour and had apps thanks to the Yelp Deal I used.  Food and drinks met expectations.  The crowd at the bar was interesting, but everyone was very friendly.  Now this is where things get interesting.  In addition to the bar, Brothers' has a wine bar, pub, and concert hall all in the same complex.  IN ADDITION, they also have certain special depending on the day of the week, including sushi night.  YOU MEAN I CAN GET SUSHI AND IPAs?  That's a win in my book."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place for years. What a mistake! The wine bar is a great place to chill and chat with friends. Really good one man band while we ate and drank. Menu small but super good. Great little known wine selection at vary reasonable markup. I may become a regular here."}
{"text":"I really like Brothers Lounge. I didn't come here much since the reopening, probably will now since I am about a mile away. It is really nice inside and the food is good. It is a good place to see some live music and enjoy yourself. I really don't like crossing W 117th if I had more than one beer on a given night so it looks like I will be staying on the Cleveland side and Brothers will continue to be place I frequent."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Brothers Lounge. Their wine bar area is the perfect spot to enjoy the evening with a special someone. Their mussels are amazing, the wings perfectly crispy and I have dreams about the short rib sandwich. Brothers has something for everyone. It really is one of their best spots in the city."}
{"text":"Wine Bar was awesome with live acoustic entertainment. Great food! The only reason it did not get a 5 star was it closed at around 12:30am and they asked us to shift to the bar next door."}
{"text":"Recently visited Brothers Lounge while in town for business as it was recommended to me by local friends.  Enjoyed the energy in the atmosphere. The music by a local musician who everyone seemed to know was really quite good.   Not sure of the beer prices since i didn't pay for any of them (love being a woman) but I will comment on the food and service.   Food: I ordered buffalo wings (yes, i ordered chicken wings during lent) but could only eat two because they were too greasy and I was not drunk enough to overlook the problem.   Service: our server was a young women who would not crack a smile or make eye contact in spite of my multiple attempts. Even though I didn't pay for my beer or food I still tip the servers accordingly & I generally tip very well 20% or better. Not bragging just stating the facts (Ok, maybe I am bragging just a little).  At the end of the evening I opted to tip her for her service after all since she did serve me well and smiles are over rated!   However server cost Brothers Lounge a star because even though smiles are not required being nice does matter and she was unfriendly all evening. Maybe she didn't think I would tip since my bar tabs were paid by others....not sure. I'm willing to give this place another opportunity the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"How to describe this bar, a bar within a bar within a bar within a bar. This location has your traditional bar and then you can walk through one hallway and end up in the wine bar, which includes someone playing tunes on a piano. Then you can walk back through the hallway and head back to the concert area, which features a nice stage.  Each of the bars have a great variety of food and drinks. But, the really nice thing about these bars is that their is something for everyone. The first time I came here my friend and I hopped between the normal bar to the wine bar for a couple of hours till the concert area opened up. And once it opened up we met more friends. And not once did we have to go out in the cold weather to get to a different location."}
{"text":"I like the location of this place, I grew up a street over on 114th and attended St. Rose up until second grade. My buddy, we'll call him MIT to protect his identity from online predators, worked the door for the music venue in the back of this establishment. I've seen one, maybe two cool bands, the rest sucked. Bartenders are cool, but their not raking in any serious cash based on looks, it's all work ethic here buddy. Joking, they're cool though. Moving along, their food is not half bad great happy hour menu, kinda pricey otherwise, in my opinion.   I noticed them always telling me they don't have 3/4 beers I always asked for. I always switched it up for this reason and same outcome. Needless to say, don't come here looking for any spectacularly amazing beers, or even some basic ones. They're slacking in that section. The crowd has never been overly exciting, or special either, come to think of it, I'll probably never go back here again. Never say never, but I don't foresee it in my immediate future.   All in all, I'd recommend checking it out for yourselves."}
{"text":"What a great place/gem. Went with wife and had a sampling of all four venues available by this great place.  Loved the wine bar the best with Althea solo aquatic artist.  Great selection of wines and very well priced wine and liquor.  Then moved on to bar/pub area, upbeat and friendly.  Then went to the music venue area with a great band, very friendly crowd willing to share table seats and conversations as well.  Finally went outside to the outer bar and just a great place to relax, hear great tunes and be able to have a normal volume conversation.  Looking forward to going again!!"}
{"text":"This place is a welcome addition to my regulars list. The food is always good and the sushi is a real bargain on Tuesdays. But I come here because the staff and owners always make me feel right at home. The sushi class was a real fun time (even though some loud-mouth clown, the founder of some software company here in town, was being a complete and utter tool). I always have a good time at Brother's."}
{"text":"I love Brothers!!  And not just because my husband and I had one of our first dates here, although that will always make this a special place for us.  Brothers gets some great musical acts in here and their food is very good as well.  No matter what your mood you have your choice of a bar area, dinner area, or the music hall."}
