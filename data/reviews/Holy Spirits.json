{"text":"The food was very good, the drinks had a unique twist and the service was very professional and nice. Will be back, thoroughly enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"Stopped back in and Michelle was my server. She was very knowledgeable and attentive.  Service was great!!"}
{"text":"Michele was a great waitress she recommended items we absolutely loved. She was very informative and made wonderful suggestions   The drinks Mango Fire and the Scottdale Pony were out of this world!! The food was fabulous!! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went here due to the positive reviews, but our visit was not that great and my review not positive.  New bartenders help a lot in the transformation of this place from the not so great dive bar it was to the ? want-to-be sports bar that it is now, but they do not make up for the slow service and mediocre food.  Our drinks were okay, not extraordinary.  The fish in the salmon BLT was as fresh as partially frozen can be, and the parmesan cheese on our pizza did not taste fresh.  Prices were average for the drinks and food in old town, but what they served needs to be brought up to the standards of old town."}
{"text":"I came in after just breaking up with my boyfriend, Mark L. I was a little upset, but not really. I cut my losses and came out on top. But Tommy, the bartender, was so great and made me the best whiskey/grapefruit/lychee cocktail - and now it's called The Tommy!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were absolutely delicious!!  Tommy is a fabulous mixologist and I will totally be back!!"}
{"text":"Great and friendly staff!!! The menu looked like it had a good variety,  but didn't try anything."}
{"text":"Tommy makes the best drinks!!!!!  And is soooo fun, makes you feel right at home!  Husband and I came here after a long day and it was da best!"}
{"text":"Great quaint place to hang out! Super friendly staff-awesome chicken wings & mac&cheese! Best bloody mary's ever!!!! Plus our new Steelers bar!"}
{"text":"Monique was off the hook.  The drink she made mango fire was fantastic.  Great service,  great food.  Tina,  Cave Creek"}
{"text":"Great times! Hannah our server was amazing. The drinks were great and the atmosphere was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Cute place and the bartender Tommy is AMAZING!!! Definitely recommend for drinks on the weekends and they play good music."}
{"text":"OK this place is truly a 5 star gem!!!  Great food and drink specials in old town Scottsdale[ totally unheard of] Great service with a genuine  friendliness that they remember your name [ unheard in Scottsdale]Makes you want to stay all day Sunday for sure when mimosa cost you only $2  or  pitchers of kilt-lifters or Lagunitas for $5.While we were watching football  game the owner Bill shows his appreciation by handing out shots and dessert treats! And I love  the very new modern cozy interior design, that I'm excited to call my new  tavern to chill and meet new friends!"}
{"text":"Holy Spirits has very inviting atmosphere and decor.  The mix of a wonderful total remodel and great wait and bar staff make this  place a must anytime of the week or weekend.  I will put it on my short list."}
{"text":"Stopped in today after  a Sunday morning at work.  Love how the place looks after the renovation.  The food menu is good I've had 3 of the items and can't wait to try the rest. Monique was an excellent bartender and a pleasure to chat with."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. The owner completely disgust me the way I heard him yelling at his bartender. He ruined this place for me. No wonder when I come in, there's always new staff training, I can see why the turnover rate is so high at this place."}
{"text":"Food is amazing as well as the service. Super cute and trendy decor. Great music and a fun place to meet up with friends. Make sure you check it out. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great small plates great service not to be missed. The cheese board was excellent as was the broccoli. Beer was cold and very inexpensive for the area. Great atmosphere and music. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere!!!  Great food!!!  The owner has really turned this place around!  The staff is wonderful, Monique is beautiful inside and out!  I would highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here for a few football Sundays....their $4 Bloody Mary with a slider and wing is a meal & super yummy!! The Mac and Cheese with bacon is SUPERB!!! Most of all we love how clean it is....always have a great experience with food, service and cleanliness which we can't say for all bars in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Drinks - 5 Service - 5 Food - 3  Went here on a Thursday night and we had the patio all to ourselves. I saw the reviews about the great drinks and sure enough we were lucky to have Tommy as our bartender! We didn't even need to look at a drink menu,  we told him the alcohol we wanted and he made a drink for us. The mango margarita and greyhound were my favorites. The food wasn't bad, but very average. The charcuterie board was fairly generous for the price but nothing out of the ordinary, two meats, two cheeses, and some walnuts and pecans. The steak satay were small and a little dry. I would recommend going here for drinks, and food it it's for happy hour snacks."}
{"text":"Monique is a the head bartender and she is a sweet heart. They play great music and the prices are unbelievable for being in the middle of old town. I highly recommend you try this place out.   $3 drafts all day everyday. Ummm yes please!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the staff at Holy spirits!!!!  Awesome place for food and drinks... This Sunday was outstanding... It was 8 people inmy g roup and they where e nothing but awesome  ...we will be back with more people...... Did i say 2 other friends came because we checked in there???!  We are industry people and we enjoy Great Service and Awesome Owners.... Nothing like it... See ya Sunday again!!!"}
{"text":"Only a handful of customers (10 or so) here on a Monday night watching the game. Despite that fact, the new female bartender could not handle the action. Then at the far right side of the bar, you had four women who clearly work there with laptops, etc and one woman even had her 3 year old kid eating sliders at the bar. Not one of them thought to help the bartender out or do anything else but yap to eachother.     First impressions matter and that was probably just a bad night and/or lazy employees. The beer and food prices appear to be below normal and they have a $3 burger (untried) on Monday nights. Will be back to give it another try."}
{"text":"Shrimp po boys and $3 drafts all day in Scottsdale. I thought I was back bartending in New Orleans again. Looking forward to becoming a regular."}
{"text":"New Steeler bar in old town!! Great drink specials, food, service, & crowd!! We tried everything from the Bloody Mary served w/ a slider & wing, to the burgers, steaks, fries, & potstickers were all awesome!! I highly suggest you go, whether you're a Steeler fan or not. They've great food & drink specials on a daily basis. Holy Spirits is the real deal!!"}
{"text":"Excellent prices, but more importantly excellent food.  They have menu that makes you want to try everything. Had  muffuletta and beef skewers. Beer was icy cold and perfect on a hot day. Fries crispy and salted exactly the way they should be. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Maybe my friend and I chose an off night, (friday at 5pm) but I was not impressed. The place can't decide if it's a local sports type music bar or upscale tapas. There were 2  big screen tvs  playing sports, top 40 on the radio and white table cloths...no continuity of design. As for the food...new York strip skewers were not seasoned and over done, the fried artichokes were just a culinary mistake and we're sent back.  The shrimp tacos needed some kind of crema to balance the spices. Best things were the French fries and hoison wings but  not good enough for my return. #fullbutdisappointed"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is in the middle of Old Town craziness without being overwhelming.  It is not too busy, of course I go there a lot earlier than the young people who party around that area.  Maybe that is why it was fairly quiet.  The prices are very reasonable.  Cocktails are $9 and during HH they are $7.  That is very reasonable for Scottsdale.  Tommy is fantastic, he is not a bartender, he is really a mixologist.  He asked me what I liked and he made me a wonderful gin cocktail, it was delicious.  My husband had a custom spicy margarita, also amazing.  We snacked on the beef skewers and the chicken satay.  The beef was my favorite.  I will have to try other items next time.  The shrimp one sounded so good.  The decor is modern and clean looking.  I liked the outside patio furniture.  I would have hanged out there, but the misters were going full blast and the night was a little mild for this time of year.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My favorite place I Scottsdale to watch the Steelers play! Bloody Mary's are the best! You have to try one of you go.  Caramel martinis were also good! And the blue cheese steak with broccoli was phenomenal.  What topped it all was the service though.  Great bar!"}
{"text":"We stopped in one evening with a friend before heading to Cowboy Ciao for dinner.  I enjoyed a mango tango mojito and loved it...super tasty and went down way too smooth!  Nice atmosphere, friendly bartenders and a great, extensive cocktail menu."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place while in town for a girls weekend. We are really enjoying everything about this spot. There is an outside part with misters. The staff is amazingly friendly. I really enjoy Tommy and Monique's mixology creations. Tommy welcomes you into the restaurant and you feel like you are in a good friend's home. We had the spicy Thai beef salad and mussels. We are only in town for a few days, and will be back here before heading home. Can't wait to try more of the menu out!"}
{"text":"Great place, and very reasonably priced drinks and food! We were there on penny bottled beer nights! Was a great time! Forgot the name of our bartender but she was very nice and friendly! Will definitely have to come back on a Sunday to try the bloody Mary's! And for a little football..."}
{"text":"Came in during happy hour on a Tuesday. This place just opened up and I really like the vibe.   Tommy, our bartender, made me the freshest Irish Mule I have ever had. Full array of fruits and veggies on the bar for the freshest mixed drinks. This is a good spot to take a date.   I also got the dumplings. Tommy made sure to let me know they were made from scratch, so the wait was no problem. The wait was worth it! The dumplings were juicy and crispy."}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks at a good price. Fun atmosphere and a great place to watch the Steeler games. Owners are very accommodating and pass out small bites to enjoy."}
{"text":"Lots of spots in Old Town have a cool vibe but a mediocre menu. Holy Spirits has done well on both ends and offers something unique. We came on a Sunday afternoon and tried about 6 different tapas plates, all of which were phenomenal. My only suggestion would be a better craft beer list."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Jean  our bartender was friendly and made the best drinks! Just discovered it today and will for sure be back. Its a chill spot, not overly crowded on a Friday night around 8:00. Nice patio and modern vibe."}
{"text":"Our bartender tommy was wonderful my girlfriend was trying to be lame but he convinced her otherwise with a fantastic drink! Recommend over and over"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today...loved the atmosphere, the food was awesome and the service was great! Will definately be back...want to come in the evening next time to take advantage of the open patio!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great cocktails. Tuesday all day happy hour and Lilli  makes a mean drink. The food we've tried has been great."}
{"text":"Fresh Drinks! Fresh bartenders! Fresh ambiance! Fresh people!! It smells so fresh. So fresh and so clean. Clean. Clean. I love the Holy Spirit.. And spirits. They have a great liquor selection along with fresh garnishing to top off the delicious drinks. Speaking of drinks, Tommy the bartender is the best at making muddled drinks, literally any drink. Love him so much! It's my first time here and it was love at first sight. Holy spirits makes me feel so blessed."}
{"text":"Just spent my first Sunday at this bar watching the Steelers with a bar full of Steeler fans. It was awesome!! The food was very fairly priced and absolutely delicious! Started off with the mister Bloody Mary which came with a slider, chicken wing, bacon, and blue cheese stuffed olive. Perfect! Then I had a few small plates. The Rosemary and lemon chicken skewers were great as well as the Gorgonzola steak. The fries are really good too! So excited to have a great place for Steelers game!! Thanks to Bill the owner for hosting us!"}
{"text":"Came here only for drinks but I will definitely come back for food some time. My boyfriend & I walked by here on Friday night around 7PM & decided to check it out. Right when we walked in the owner greeted us and asked how he could help us, we said we were thinking about a glass of wine. He gave us a sample of the wine from the tap & we liked it so we stayed for 2 (only $4 during HH!). The red was a little more chilled then I would like it, not sure if that's normal coming from the tap or not. The inside is very open & there's a cute little patio. Staff is very friendly. Looking forward to coming back for food soon!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and stopped in to be high fived by a few Steeler fans on our way in! Sunday happy hour deals were spectacular- especially for Scottsdale! All their prices are low for what you would expect for the area. The bar is clean and upscale and the open air atmosphere is great as the weather is getting nice. We ordered Mac and cheese and hummus and both were better than expected. We only got one drink off the cocktail menu, the Fresh and Easy, which was delicious! We'll be back next Sunday! I would recommend this spot to anyone... except Ravens fans."}
{"text":"I am surprised this venue has such good reviews...I've only been once but I firmly believe that any watering hole that includes cocktails or spirits in their name should at the very least be able to make a decent libation.    Perhaps I found the 1 bartender there who never heard that an old fashioned includes an orange peel and not a muddled mess of an orange, club soda, and Bourbon.   I only give this place 2  because the decor is on point and the place has potential. Get some mixologists and fix the probs"}
{"text":"Excited to go back and try more of their tasty food! I had the dumplings and the grilled broccoli, both were phenomenal! Bar staff is fun and friendly, and they have an excellent cocktail list! Great new spot in Old Town for Sunday Funday!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service & food. Best Bloody Mary in town! $4 & includes a wing and a slider."}
{"text":"Landed in here by accident searching for a different bar but the place smelled like bleach.  Very plain bar however the drinks were cheap and the bartender was friendly.  Just wasn't our scene and didn't try food."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Service was great.   My only concern was that the bar struggled making their signature drinks. Still, a great value in old town"}
{"text":"Kind attentive servers.   Complete redo of the location. Drinks are yummy and food Looks great.  Try the limoncello!"}
{"text":"Tommy the bartender was great! Good personality and knows how to make a good drink! Really nice place with great food."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good food and affordable drinks. Steelers bar on Sundays come check it out!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!  I feel the need to genuflect to the bartender Tommy and chef Alfredo for literally carving the 11th commandment into my pallet - \"Thou Shalt Always Eat and Drink at Holy Spirits\".  Absolutely AMAZING drinks and food!!  KUDOS!!!"}
{"text":"I came on a cold Wednesday evening with a friend for drinks and small bites.  The place looks pretty cool with some modern spunk.  The service was real attentive and quick with all our drink orders and food - kudos to that.  HH prices here are pretty decent for being in Scottsdale so that's a plus.  So far so good with the start.  We started with a Mango Fire, a tequila infused with jalapeno, liqueur, lime and mango and the Colorado Seduction, bourbon, spiced pear liqueur and lemons; both pretty solid drinks. However, I wasn't a big fan of the food here.  I just felt like it was out of the package and thrown in the fryer or grill.  We ordered the broccoli, fried dumplings, and mussels.  I appreciated the broccoli for having that charred flavor and the cheese atop.  The fried dumplings were pretty basic and layed on some sweet and sour sauce.  The mussels were probably my favorite; it had a sweet and comforting broth.  In the end, I think Holy Spirits would be great for drinks and fun, but food needs to improve. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. They have a great menu great cocktails and the staff is also friendly. Seems as though they've gone through a couple issues with employees that didn't want to do their jobs but for the most part they seem to treat every employee with respect and fairness and the ones that are still there are very happy to be there. They have great specials great prices and they show all the football games college and NFL every Saturday and Sunday and any other day that the game is on. check this place out, it's a great alternative to the same Scottsdale bar or nightclub that seems to be popping up every other month in that area. The ownership here definitely took the time to put the place together correctly and to consider something different in that area that would complement the entire city and cater to different age brackets. I will be spending a lot of time here I suggest you do also."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We go here on Sunday's to watch the football game.  Awesome friendly staff, fantastic drink and food specials too!  Where else can you get a $4 bloody mary with a snack to go with it!!  I try something different off the menu every time I go, and have yet to not like anything they have!  And a MAJOR Thank You to Bill the owner for hosting our Steelers group!  We appreciate you!!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place that was empty and I was a little shocked as to why. I am writing this on New Year's Day so people may be tuckered out from last night. Anyways, I ordered the \"Not Your Fathers Root Beer\" to experiment and it was an absolute win! Dangerous, but still a win. The place is a solid place to vibe and chill. Oh and they have a creative drawing, pun intended, where you draw on the designated walls. Best drawing gets a gift card."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here for lunch, as I work right next door. The food is tapas so perfect size for lunch. They all serve 3 dollar drafts all day. The best part of the place though is the staff. Everyone is user nice. They always remember you and great you with a smile. Super sad that lily is no longer on staff. She was the best, but everyone else is amazing also. Chanel is sweet and will remember your favorite beer no problem. Bill the owner is always around and will come greet you once he knows your face. Plus they do an awesome drawing contest every month where you can win a 100 buck tab! I won it. I felt like a star. Lol. Come here. It's delicious and fun ;)"}
{"text":"Go see Tommy! Love him! Made us personal drinks! Amazing craft cocktails, delish food, such a great place for catching up with friends."}
{"text":"What once was the divey Social Tap has transformed into the upscale Holy Spirits. Tommy the bartender leads the charge with a mixture of potent drinks and fresh juices, the drink menu is non existent. However you won't mind. You will be too busy enjoying the atmosphere and the ability to hear your company to find anything lacking. Its a great new spot that will become a staple in old town for people who appreciate the finer things."}
{"text":"Tommy is amazing! I had a wonderful experience! Can't wait to meet Bill the owner. I've heard great things"}
{"text":"Tommy is a superb bartender! Very personable and friendly, he made anything we wanted and it was very delicious. Customer service, mixology and cuisine at its finest."}
{"text":"I went here on Sunday for the first time with friends. I am always looking for a great happy hour spot on Sunday's to watch sports and I must say this is the place. They have an amazing Monster Bloody Mary's that come topped off with a beef slider, a chicken wing, a couple green onion stems, green olives, a clove of garlic, a pickle, and last but not least a mini carrot. One of the best Bloody Mary's in the valley and not too spicy but most of all it was only $4.00 all day long. Well drinks are also only $4.00 on Sunday's. Also the mac & cheese was awesome. Good food prices too. I will say this is classy joint to hang out in, you get great service from the bartenders, and you pretty much can't beat those prices anywhere in old town on a Sunday.  I do have some suggestions. The audio is set too loud during the games, so it makes it hard to hear your friends at the table and so i recommend it be turned down. I also recommend placing another couch with chairs on the other side of the patio. It seems when i was in there most people were hanging out in your outdoor living space area, two areas like that would draw more people. When people are coming by for a drink there is really no place to sit and mingle except that area or the bar. You do have plenty of seating for dining, however people are less likely to sit at a wood table for a drink."}
{"text":"Found this \"newer\" place about 6 weeks ago. It has quickly become a favorite. Great prices on draft beer everyday and all day. They do not have happy hour food pricing, but their menu is reasonably priced all the time as well. Servers are great, and overall this place is very cool."}
{"text":"I came here after breaking up with my girlfriend Kelly. I was a little upset, not really I cut my losses I'm on top now.  But Tammy  made me the best drink ever Gin/Tonic Water/Lime/Ice Cubes/TonicWater/Gin/Gin/Gin/Gin and now it's called the Tammy Lit...Bsst day ever..."}
{"text":"Its pretty good. I was here for a business meeting and I had what they had before they went through there a revamp of the menu and everything is really delicious"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere of this place!!!!!! We were greeted by a beautiful girl at the entrance. Very inviting. Jean, our waitress, was so sweet and attentive. The food was delicious! Our party ordered: the roasted cauliflower, artichokes, lemon salmon, hoisin wings, veggie pizza and drinks. They even had GLUTEN FREE BEER!!!!! YEESSSS!!!!!!!"}
