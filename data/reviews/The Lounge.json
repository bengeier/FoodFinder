{"text":"I can't believe we had breakfast right next door, at Scramble, for years before giving this place a try! This is my new FAV. Fantastic food, fantastic drinks, fantastic atmosphere, fantastic music and fantastic bartender. Did I mention that this place is fantastic?? Very hip, very sexy and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First place that has ever moved me to actually go to the trouble to write a review. I found it thanks to other great Yelpers. Everything was true. Great atmosphere,  Awesome music and Wonderful bartender! Thanks for the gummy bear martini Chris! Spot on, I tell ya! We need more places like this in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night at about 9pm for a quick late dinner. There were maybe 6 people at the bar, zero people seated at tables. My date and I walked in and were not greeted by anyone, even though everyone (patrons included) turned to look at us when we walked in the entrance. We sat ourselves at a table. Eventually the bartender came and brought water & menus, no greeting or smile. He actually seemed bothered by us. He left to give us a moment to check out the menu and never returned. I wanted to leave immediately, my date didn't want to be rude and suggested we have 1 drink before we go. Well we ended up leaving before having that drink because the bartender never came back. The best part of the night: Realizing there are still good guys out there, like my date, (who on our first date), thought it polite to stay for one drink even though we  were being treated impolitely.   To sum it up, steer clear of The Lounge."}
{"text":"Visited The Lounge for the first time on a Tuesday. We were greeted by Yvonne and she was excellent. Very friendly and frequently checked up on us. A drink was made and wasn't to her satisfaction so instead of serving it to us she had a new one made! Now that's someone thAt really cares about quality and customers.   We had a few drinks, old fashioned and some other nice unique drinks! We had the spinach artichoke dip which was amazing and the ceviche! Both were delicious.   Very clean place and wasn't busy at all on a Tuesday evening. I recommend this lounge!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Great atmosphere!  Yummy drinks and awesome staff. The owner and bartender \"Russell\" were fantastic . I will definitely go back when I'm back in town"}
{"text":"This is the best lounge to be at. The owners are very courteous and very aware of the business. They treat everyone that comes in like family. They make you feel at home always. On Wednesdays is Comedy nights, Thursdays is Havana nights, Fridays is Motown/R&B nights and Saturday is Jazz nights. I truly recommend The Lounge to have fun, or just for a mellow night. They also have a bar and patio outside, with an extra back patio with a fireplace if you want a little intimate place to hang with your significant other.   I love The Lounge..."}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails. Good food menu. Great place if you are looking for a swanky place to drink and chat!"}
{"text":"Great little bar! You can enjoy a nice glass of wine and have an interesting conversation with the Bartender. Cool, friendly place!"}
{"text":"Tuesday, a little after 5, place is empty and seating is showing some wear. It's a little iffy when you walk in...but the leeriness quickly goes away.  Ordered some HH drinks, mushroom caps and bruschetta .  The drink- ehhh. But the food, soooo delicious. The server was attentive and very proud of the establishment. Thumbs up! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool and laid back, nice drink menu, friendly staff! Just moved to the neighborhood and really like the place. Here's the \"but\".... They close too early! They make it so inviting with dim lighting and candles at night but they are closed before 10pm. Tried going several times at night only to be disappointed. If you want to build a night crowd you need to be open at night. I will definitely keep going back! Hopefully they will start staying open later."}
{"text":"I live in the apartments right behind this bar. its the only bar in my immediate neighborhood that i go to frequently. Very high end on the inside without any of the funny business you get just down the road at some of the other bars nearby. (if you know the area you know exactly what I'm talking about). But back to the review. the use the same kitchen as il posto next store, but have a lot of their own dishes as well (try the Mediterranean fries!) As for the drinks, after all it is a bar, they having a variety of specialty cocktails and a great bartender (chris) that is sure to mix you up something you will love. Lots of beer and wine to chose from. Generally play indie rock with the games on a couple TVs. Very chill place, great for a date or an after dinner drink."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Attentive, talkative and friendly waitstaff. Classy atmosphere and not too loud for conversation."}
{"text":"I just absolutely love this place. The vibe is smooth and the martinis are amazing  I have yet to do dinner but I found the bartender very friendly and courteous and professional"}
{"text":"Really lovely place. Tasty food and the drinks are amazing! The bartenders are friendly and if you don't know what to order or want to try something new, they're happy to make something just for you."}
{"text":"We went on a ladies night which is on Friday with a small group of Moms. The drinks were great I believe Chris was the bartender that night. Super nice guy and the cocktail waitress also did a great job. Once the music started (which was live r&b Motown and not to mention awesome) . We decided we wanted to chat a lil more so we moved Into the restaurant patio area which is connected. It was super cute. Love that this place is down the street."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last month with some buddies for happy hour. The bruschetta and fried provolone are awesome. Just a great vibe overall from this place and the bartender was super cool. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have only been to the Lounge  maybe 3 times with my daughter and her friends It is an absolutely adorable bar,the atmosphere is awesome and very comfortable. drinks are amazing  and Chris the bartender is also amazing. ..I absolutely love this place definitely no dive bar."}
{"text":"Online this place looked intriguing so me and a friend threw on some cloths and said let's check it out. After driving away see get the to an empty parking lot :( it was closed (Sunday night 9/10/17) online it said the joint was open but we arrived to nothing maybe we will get to try another time. The food looked delicious online"}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars often, but the service we received was exceptional.  My boyfriend and I have been visiting from out of town staying at a nearby resort. We stopped by on our first night in town because it was close and had good reviews.  The ownership is somewhat new,  about 10 months.  Our first night Chris welcomed us and let us know about all the live music they had on certain nights of the week. Needless to say we spent 3 nights of our 5 night stay visiting here for a couple cocktails. Have their bread! The spread was amazing!  Great cocktail menu!"}
{"text":"As I like to stay loyal to my service gurus I also like to eat a certain way due to my prior health issues .. a special thank you to Melanie  whom I will follow whenever she may go and what I great new place to come too . One of my My favorite bartenders  Melanie and kris   and I love the atmosphere of the lounge cozy and not to mention the mushrooms are amazing . Wow !!! my salad was a absolutely perfect with a great portion of salmon on my healthy dish . Thank you for all you do im happy to see a good list of salads as well  HairdocTK"}
{"text":"Thank you for finally opening a fun bar in Sunnyslope!  The wine was great and the Bruschetta was excellent!  I definitely recommend checking The Lounge out if you live in the area!"}
{"text":"Laid back. Awesome drinks. Good food. I'll be back for sure. I'm surprised there weren't more people on a Sunday night. Great service."}
{"text":"My anticipation was high while waiting for the construction to finish.  My hopes were for a cool neighborhood bar and....that's what The Lounge is!   The hubbs and I checked out the new bar (best part was the short  5 minute drive) on a Thursday night after work.  Walking in we were impressed with the modern lounge decor and atmosphere...something modern and fun to look at.  Unfortunately,  we were two of the three patrons in the bar but we still enjoyed ourselves, the conversation, music, and of course our drinks.    The menu is limited to appetizers but there is a restaurant next door (Il Posto) if you're in need a full meal which, btw, also makes this a nice convenient spot to meet.  Prices were good for both drinks and appetizers.  Overall a great place for date night or drinks with friends.  We will return again soon and hope that more folks have found this little treasure of a lounge."}
{"text":"Kinda bummed, the bf and I came for a late night bite and drink. Yelp said they're open til midnight, but once we pulled up (via lyft) it was closed at 10:05p. Maybe we will get to check it out another time."}
{"text":"I had my first experience at The Lounge last night.  I have to say the drinks were AWESOME!  A few of us dropped in after the Home Tour.  My boyfriend and I just gave the bartender our taste/flavor preferences and Chris the bartender did more than deliver!  I had been wanting to try the Whip Cream flavored vodka for quite some time and Chris mixed me up an orange-creamsicle tasting drink with it.  My boyfriend had the Tokyo Tea which uses Midori alongside traditional Long Island ingredients. It's great to find a nice lounge without having to drive too far from home.  The service was awesome, very friendly and personal.  This is a great place to take a few friends and just enjoy some good drinks and good company.  I can't wait to go back and try the food and more of the delicious drinks from Chris."}
{"text":"Wow! Just got through ordering dinner and drinks, it used to be ladies tonight on Fridays. And ladies drinks for five dollars. Has been that way for several years. Didn't realize they had changed so drastically. Came in our ladies drinks went from 5 to 8 dollars well was six dollars. After 6 PM. Very disappointedWent on the website and they still say ladies night is Friday night! What exactly do the ladies get? Ordered pizzas. Not as good as it used to be. We will not be back. Sorry we used to love coming here!"}
{"text":"I came to visit my gf in AZ and we decided on my last night, we'd go out for drinks.  She chose this place, which I found to be PERFECT. It was a quiet, little lounge.  We were kind of hungry so we ordered the quesadillas and they were delish.  Ordered a couple of drinks and my martini was AMAZING, Chris is an AWESOME bartender, friendly, courteous,, and makes amazing drinks.  Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Came for happy hour.   Pleasantly surprised.   Service great.   Appetizer menu good.   Will return."}
{"text":"definitely a lounge. pleasant music but not too loud to hear your pals. awesome bartender."}
{"text":"Great vibe!  Excellent bartender!  From out of town looking for a decent bar with some munchies.  Well this was not the place!  Its a great bar with actual food!  Casual atmosphere in the afternoons that started to pick up as we were leaving about 5:00.  Would have loved to stay longer."}
{"text":"This review is long over due!!!!  This place is small, yet quaint! The bartender is amazing!! Great attitude and extensive knowledge on making bad ass drinks!! It's definitely a must go to when around these neck of the woods!    Have fun!! :)"}
{"text":"Very cozy, was here last night ( Friday evening ) and was excited to see it wasn't a crazy bar but super laid back. Our bartender was excellent and our food was delish! Would defiantly go back. Only frustrating thing is the co-ed bathrooms"}
{"text":"GREAT BAR!  I have been here twice now and have no complaints!  The bar tender (Chris) is outstanding and nice to look at...He is great at keeping the patrons happy and keeping the conversation going!  The Lounge also carries my favorite gin (Hendrick's), which is not extraordinarily common in bars around here.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the people here always seem friendly.  It has never been crowded when I am there, which is fine by me.  I am almost afraid to give such an outstanding review, in fear of it becoming popular, because I like this little gem that Christina P. introduced me to just the way it is!"}
{"text":"What a posh, fun, hip place The Lounge is! Chris is awesome. He knows his shit, is nice to talk with, and can make any type of drink you could want. He's confident and it is quite obvious he enjoys what he does and takes making the place as great as possible quite seriously.  We didn't eat, but looked over the menu and it looked really good. A nice variety of foods and drinks. Slightly overpriced, but not too bad. Happy hour seems the best time to come.  The decorations and decor are a fun mix of class and hip. We felt really comfortable and enjoyed the relaxed feel. The pics Yelper's have posted are very accurate and depict the ambiance very well.  *Perfect place for a date.  Can't wait to head back and try some of the other drinks and have some food."}
{"text":"This place is great. Super cool, intimate, clean and modern decor.   Came here to see Carvin Jones, who always delivers. But I was not anticipating how good the food and service would be.  They share a kitchen with the Italian restaurant next door. Pretty good menu. There pizza is solid. Crust is good, toppings were great, and baked perfectly.   Service is good. Lots of hustle from the bartender and waiter. Friendly and pretty attentive.   Only gripe is the drinks; they are pricey. Good beers and cocktails, but just a few dollars more than they should be in this part of town.  All in all, an awesome place to grab dinner and see some great live music. Definitely in our rotation."}
{"text":"Service is amazing! We had two caiprinhas and they were decent. The live music is nice. Prices and happy hour was great. I just got a full walk through!! And I'm Sooooo IMPRESSED! I cannot wait for wed when they do laugh night and I have totally committed to Friday for 5 dollar you call it's! Even top shelf !!!  Chris is an awesome bartender even broke me into the green tea shot. We decided to have a pizza and it was absolutely the best pizza!! I've been ranting about this place since we left and I cannot wait to visit again!! Definitely a beautiful place for date night or just casual drinks. They have an event almost every night. Stop in & visit Chris. Tell him Candice sent you!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the drinks were cold. Bartender was very friendly. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I discovered this little bar while in the area. I was glad I went in. Bartender was friendly, drinks were decently priced, and the food was on point. I only wish it wasn't so far away, I live in Surprise, otherwise I would come here more often."}
{"text":"What a great little place!  I don't think we would have ever discovered it without Yelp.  We had an hour to kill between dinner and meeting up with friends.  It's a cool, sexy little place tucked away in a strip mall.  I really enjoyed the music they were playing (Zeppelin, if I recall) and it was at good volume - loud enough to enjoy but not so loud I couldn't hear my husband.     They have an extensive and interesting drink menu.  I highly recommend the Maple Bar.    I would definitely love to come back when we have a bit more time."}
{"text":"The Happy Hour menu is very good, they changed it. We got 4 beers, a pizza and an appetizer for $25. Definitely will be going back soon :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great funk band on funk Friday! More of a mature/seasoned crowd that is social and friendly. Wonderful disco ball decor and atmosphere. Intimate and personal. Definitely a local gem! Highly recommend for those that want delicious food(crab cakes were bomb and I wanted to eat everyone's pizza), live music, dancing, with no drama or youngsters lol."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to the excellent food and service I had experienced here before.  Bringing friends who listened to my raves about this cozy but chic lounge right near home.  How disappointed we all were.  Not sure if it was an off night but the caprase salad paled in comparison to what I had on previous occasions being served on yellowing, hard tomato slices, water that tasted like soap and an over all funky smell seemed to almost border on pathetic.  A few positives:  our drinks were great, the pizza was delicious and the waiter caring and attentive but looked overly tired.  We will try it one more time.  It had really been a find in our community so hopefully it was just an off night."}
{"text":"This place is just nice. If you want a neighborhood bar where you feel welcome regardless, who you are...this is the place you want to be. I live literally across the street, and this is my favorite spot right now. Love the place. Let me tell you Chris is awesome, good customer service. Just a good place to be."}
{"text":"This place looks like it should be so chic and fun, but really it's just sort of...sad.   The decor and setup is actually really great, but our server seemed to be opposed to actually speaking words to us as opposed to just standing by our table silently and waiting for us to notice him and give him our orders unprompted.  The food was exactly as mediocre as possible.  The house cocktails were decent, but overpriced.  We came here on a Saturday night and there were only like 6 other people there.   It's just....in a strange area of town. If they moved this place, exactly as it is, to a better location, it would be hoppin for sure. But they need to upgrade the service and the food first."}
{"text":"We had a group of about 8 of us when we arrived at the quaint spot. We were greeted by what I can only imagine was a disgruntled employee who yelled out that the kitchen was closed like he didn't want to be bothered. We opted to stay despite his rudeness since its hard to find a good chill spot on the west side. The drinks were good and reasonably priced, the setting was great, music could have been better."}
{"text":"We stopped into the Lounge before our dinner next door at Il Posto.  I enjoyed a perfectly mixed martini in the cool lounge.  This place has a nice atmosphere without trying too hard, the staff is friendly and the drink list is extensive."}
{"text":"The Lounge is a great place to hang out with a group of friends or by yourself.  It has a great atmosphere, friendly customers, delicious food, and an amazing bartender.  Chris is the real deal-he is great to talk with, can create any drink you ask for and makes everyone that walks through the door feel welcomed no matter if it is their first visit or one of his regulars.  He is very attentive and goes above and beyond to make sure everyone has a great experience.  Just be careful-you will get spoiled by how great he treats you and will expect that from others but they will not come close.   Chris definitely makes this a place you will come back to again and again."}
{"text":"Perfectly made cocktails! Have visited several times and always had great service as well. The chairs could use replacement as they are definitely showing signs of wear."}
{"text":"Bartender Russell made us feel right at home! Awesome service & fabulous drinks! Ambiance & relaxed atmosphere is great, and the mussels were outstanding! Defiantly will return!"}
{"text":"Jazz night was not great. Enjoyed the band when the singer was not singing and just the instruments were playing. We ate at Ziggy's next door for dinner and were told we would not be charged a cover fee, but were charged when we received our bill."}
{"text":"This was a great atmosphere!! A group of us went on a Saturday night as we celebrated my brothers wedding. We are from out of state. The ambiance was nicely set dim but not too dim. There was a live jazz band and they were amazing! They even sang a song dedicated to the newlyweds. The service was good as well!! I wish we had such a place near where I reside. I would definitely recommend. The food from what I tasted was also delicious!!"}
{"text":"We got to watch the band on blues night and we had a great time! The pizza we ordered was fabulous. If you happen to go just to the restaurant side they do have a great Chicago style theme patio with murals of balconies and Italian Tuscany style homes.. Not be missed! It's a great spot for us to chill and listen to awesome live music from jazz nights to blues and more! Just great food and entertainment!"}
{"text":"Great little place, neighborhood bar. Love the new owner. Miss Chris the bartender, but this place is fun now. Better food at happy hour and delish drinks. They also are doing live music and dancing depending on the night. Fun!"}
{"text":"Best. Cosmo. Ever. Ask for Chris. He know's his cocktails AND his wine. Just tell him what you like and he will mix or match you up with something splendid!  Besides having the best bartender in town, the  ambiance is chill and the food is delish. A hidden gem in north central Phoenix."}
{"text":"My apologies for taking so long to update my review! 3.5 stars - pshaw!  Probably my favorite neighborhood stop for a cocktail! GREAT drinks -- just tell Chris, the bartender/host, what type of drink you like and he'll hook you up with some sort of fantastic concoction!   The service is outstanding. Always striving to ensure we're having a great time and willing to go above and beyond to meet our needs. Even \"opening\" the kitchen after it had closed for us to get some late night eats!  And there's happy hour, now!!"}
{"text":"Very cozy atmosphere and good margaritas. Place was not crowded at all since we went on a week night and had a very private feel. Small lounge but I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Great bar, great LIVE music, and great drinks! We met the owner, who was really nice too. My boyfriend came to Phoenix for a couple of days, and we were looking for a fun place to go on a Thursday night. We met some nice local people while we were there, and there was a great live band! The bar is a small, intimate bar with an upbeat atmosphere. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Nice intimate and romantic atmosphere where the lights are dimmed with candles, at least it is for tonight. Friendly staff. The live jazz band Saturday night is pretty good too."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night a few weeks ago and it was DEAD. The bartender made it pretty clear that he was keen to leave. Don't get me wrong, I felt in no way pressured to hurry, but I got the point in any case. To give the benefit of the doubt, the others at the bar seemed to be regulars so perhaps he felt more at ease about expressing himself. The interior is nice, but this place did not give a very good first impression. I will give it another shot though. Hoping to give a higher rating next time."}
{"text":"staying at the Tapatio and wanted an interesting place that wasn't far. This place delivered!  We went on their Wednesday Comedy night. Was glad that someone posted that while it feels a bit sketchy when u walk in, take a chance and all is good. The food was from the yummy Italian Restaurant next door and was good and a good value. The comedy was mostly bad but entertaining nonetheless. Made us appreciate seasoned comedians we see on TV; everyone has to cut their teeth somewhere. And, hey, there was no cover!"}
{"text":"I am very glad we decided to visit the lounge, the food and service is amazing! We will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I ventured here on an evening without the child. We sat at the bar and I ordered from their specialty cocktail menu: one was grapefruity but was a smidge too sweet for me and by the time i had the second, I was too buzzed to remember now what it was. So they have a good solid pour! The bartender was very friendly. The ambience is velvet lounge-y with a dash of cheese -- which i think is on purpose, if not i'm not trying to offend. The best part of the evening at this place was definitely the live music. I wish I could remember their names because they were getting down! They were playing the hits of yesterday -- one man singing and one man playing on the keyboard. They were having fun and so was I! We ended up ordering one of their pizzas to go and it was so good. So. much. garlic. Heavenly. All of the food that was coming in looked and smelled amazing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I heart The Lounge!  It's the perfect classy neighborhood bar where they'll literally always remember your name and your wine choice.  Chris, the bartender, is easy on the eyes and knows his wine.  I live in Scottsdale and this is one of my favorite bars."}
{"text":"Stopped in again last night after dinner at Il Posto.  Still love it.  The new bartender, Russel, is great.  Russel offer some very personal service and took good care of us.  Good spot..check it out."}
{"text":"Fabulous fun band, yes! Good food, yes! Great service, Yes! Will return, yes! Staff is incredible. Yess"}
{"text":"We stopped here a few weeks ago on a Saturday Morning for a Bloody Mary. We met Greg (Ziggy). He showed us around and invited us back for food and to enjoy music in the lounge. We went on 3/2 for happy hour, planning to only stay for an hour, for a drink and pizza.... Well several hours later, we had the pleasure of hearing a fabulous blues band and to sample some of the food. We never got to the pizza. The house bread and special butter are so amazing and fabulous. We shared the spinach artichoke dip and the bruschetta, the flavor for both is awesome and the portions are huge. The atmosphere is like a dinner theater/lounge, classy! Our bartenders Chris and Serena were attentive and fun. It was a great Thursday night outing. We'll be back to try more of the delicious food! It was a special treat to have Greg stop by to check on us! Thank you Greg, your place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great little Bar just south of Tapatio resort.  Classy but not too fancy.  Friendly bartenders and locals"}
{"text":"Great music groups and wonderful drinks.  Love the local music acts each night.   Very eclectic crowd. Jazz blues stand up comedy."}
{"text":"The server we had is a really nice guy. Loved the atmosphere it is as you would expect a nice lounge to come sit and enjoy a drink or two with a friend.   I don't know if i would necessarily come here for food, but for a more \"adult\" kick back with some friends this place is a must....And when i say adult i don't mean strip club..."}
{"text":"Food was great - only one server/bartender but she was very hard working. Not mentioned was that the new ownership does not respect the 25% off offer found here on Yelp - otherwise it was a really nice dinner with a live performer."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and thought the hubby and I would try it. Awesome place with comfortable vibe. Good Happy hour specials. The bruschetta and mushrooms were delicious. I would come again."}
{"text":"New owners so no Yelp 25% of food discount as of 7-07-16 :(   I just spent 2 hours listening to \"Musica Cubana.\" Me encanto! Habana Nights on Thursdays! You should have felt the atmosphere, the regulars were celebrating a birthday and the party just kept arriving throughout the evening. Everyone was super friendly!   Food is from next door \"Ziggy's Italian Pizza.\" We had the pizza and the arugula-apple salad which was delicious!   I had a Caparina drink which was like a mojito but no mint.   I wish this place was closer to me. It was full of Latin flavor! There were people from pretty much every part of South America: Cuba, Venezuela, Panamá, Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, Puerto Rico, and Mexicans, African Americans, Polish people, White people and more.   Service was great, but then it got super busy and it became a little slow due to only one or two waiters."}
{"text":"This bar has become my go to bar. Its very nice and modern and the service is always top notch. Its never very crowded which could be a good thing, in fact its usually quite."}
{"text":"Meet some friends for drinks...as always Chris made our visit awesome. Every time we bring friends here, they love the place!"}
{"text":"Apparently the 25% off coupon is from the previous owners and they will no longer honor it at the end of your dinner.  Also seems like no one under the age of 50 goes here -- just an FYI."}
{"text":"I joined my gal pal Chrissy P for a drink at The Lounge last night and I was pleasantly surprised. Like she said, it is definitely the Sidebar of Sunnyslope!  We had great, friendly, attentive service from Chris (and he wasn't rough on the eyes, ladies!!) and he was pretty knowledgeable about the drinks.  I opted for a red wine flight and was pleased with the selection. There were two cabs, two zins, a red, a pinot noir, a merlot, two malbecs, and another choice or two. Mostly from California. The flight was $9.  They had a ton of variety of chairs and areas to sit, which was really awesome. You could sit on the high-tops, share a table for four in big white contemporary chairs, grab a normal table by the window, or opt for these really huge oversize comfy purple chairs, which we did.   Mellow lounge music played over the speakers and there were several TV\"s with relevant sports on. The Magic 8 Balls were a cool touch. The place has a really good vibe. I dig it.   The food selection was made of appetizers, but unfortunately as a gluten free vegan, all I could eat were the freshly made potato chips. By unfortunately I mean \"THANK GOD\" because they were delicious!  Overall I am really jazzed about this place! A quick five minutes away from my house, this is the perfect way to wind down from a stressful day!  I hope they adopt a happy hour and add some more vegan items to the menu and I will become a regular!"}
{"text":"Went to Scottsdale for a spa weekend with my sister.  Found The Lounge through Yelp and liked the reviews.  They didn't disappoint.  The food and music were amazing.  Chris made me THE best Old Fashioned I've ever had in my life...I ended up having 3 :/. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Saturday nights.. Entertainment is on point if you appreciate  jazz. For those who love and appreciate jazz you must visit The Lounge. It's sophisticated. It reminds me of Smalls in NYC (intimate & filled with talent). What makes it better is the service and delicious food."}
{"text":"What we have here is a dark, cool and charming neighborhood bar. It's romantic ambiance is nicely done, a place to come with a date to have a glass of wine.  Had a delightfully curious Hendrick's cucumber martini. Crisp and clean. I still think I like dirty martini's the best. However desert  juniper gin, a hand-crafted American spirit using handpicked, wild, juniper berries is at the moment my favorite gin.  Normally I don't do too much brown food but the home made potato chips with the pesto sauce was pretty yummy. Something I normally would not eat.  Since this shack is in my hood I will be back."}
{"text":"First off do not go to their website as it is false advertising.  The happy hour is only until 6pm not 7pm which is on their website.  Also there is no such thing as a ladies night on Fridays anymore, AND if you get there before 8pm (when the band starts playing) they add 2.00 extra to your bill, even if you were there between 6 and 7 for dinner.  Waiters were very apologetic and also frustrated with the changes as well, unsure how they keep their cool but much kudos Waiters!  Even their menus still read happy hour until 7 and ladies night on Friday.   Spoke to the manager and he did not honor the ladies night and let us order ONE drink on happy hour price. Never even came to our table to apologize to the party.  Also the manager is also the bartender!  Do not waste your time!  Plus the co-ed restrooms got to go along with the bulky seating!"}
{"text":"Best date nite ever...great food, great service, awesome band and amazing atmosphere. Cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Cute Decor, excellent relaxing atmosphere I have wonderful bartender/ owner, Chris! We had a great time, relaxed with some happy hour cocktails, and great appies.  Lovely spot, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"A really wonderful place. Perfect to have a conversation and enjoy a cocktail with great food. Chris Russell does a great job of shaking up a martini and is a terrific server too.   Perfect spot to go, centrally located with a big parking lot . We will return."}
{"text":"Very nice, upscale bar.  It is next to Il Posto.  It is owned by the same people who own the Italian restaurant next door and also Our Gang in the same complex. They have some of the best pizza around!  The homemade potato chips are a must try.  Their salads are very fresh.    It is kind of a sports bar with large screen TV's. We were there on a Saturday night during football season watching the game.  They had the sound turned down and were playing music.  The table next to us were there to also watch the game.  We asked if they could turn on the sound to the game and they did.  They said they usually only have the sound for the NFL games.  That was pretty good.    They have a  kind of co-ed bathroom in the bar but you can also walk through Il Posto and use their bathrooms."}
{"text":"I love this place,  it's cool,  upscale and very modern.  In addition to the great food and drinks the bartender is the best bartender I have ever incountered.

This time we invited some friends of ours and we all had an amazing time. The service at this place is great, and the prices are very reasonable with great food. We will be back soon"}
