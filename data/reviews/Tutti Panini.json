{"text":"Love the veal sandwiches here! We always get the signature sandwich to get a few more toppings on our sandwich. Beware - this sandwich is huge! It's also quite sloppy to eat it but it's super delicious. 

Their mussels marinara is very flavourful and is also a great value - the portion is very generous. You should get a bun so the marinara sauce doesn't go to waste! Their fried calamari is also delicious. 

This is a great casual lunch spot if you're in the area for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Always great veal & chicken parm sandwiches (they also have meatball & steak) - very fresh with 2 toppings included.  My family has also tried their arancini which we all agreed was excellent in flavour & texture."}
{"text":"I went there on Tuesday night at 7:15pm. The place was quiet and dirty. They used to have the $5 pasta promotion. I was looking at the menu, it seems they no longer has that offer. I asked the girl if they still have the promotion, she replied in her emotionless flat tone, \"no, it was in the beginning. We have regular price now.\" It didn't make me feel so good when she gave such attitude.
I ordered 2 penne with creme sauce, it came to $22 with change. While I was waiting for my order, the girl was too busy chatting with some guys in the kitchen whereas she could possibly offer some customer service like, keep us posted on the order, small talk etc. I didn't feel welcome nor appreciated at all!!! 
When I got home, opened the containers, sauce was watery sitting at the bottom. Food was ok, not impressive. We were completely disappointed with this place and swore not to return. For that kind of price range and quality, we would be better off order from Fellinis, which have better quality of food, same price range and definitely way better service. Staff at Fellinis do smile, offer seat and water while customer wait for take out.

I still cannot believe Tutti Panini offers such horrible service consider their location is not the most convenient compare to any other eatery in the area. The girl who works there is stone cold. NO customer service whatsoever, zero!!! In fact, I would consider she was plain rude. She turned her back to us ( with my two little ones) while we wait for our order at the counter. It was a BAAaaaaaD experience. NEVER EVER GO BACK!! NEVER EVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a small establishment that is really only good for take out. The girls at the counter are young and not very experienced so customer service is a bit shaky.

The food itself is okay. I do like their pizza quite a bit although it is a bit pricey being almost twice as expensive as the chains (dominos, pizzaville etc). 

I did get their $5 pasta lunch special. Sauce was okay but really watery. Nothing other than noodles. No meat etc. Even though it is five dollars it ended up feeling like I over spent.

I haven't tried much else on their menu as it is a bit expensive and nothing jumps out as being unique. Just some basic fare Italian-Canadian food."}
{"text":"Tutti Panini, located in the North end of Richmond Hill (formally known as Oak Ridges) made a terrible error in switching locations about a year ago, moving from a highly visible Yonge Street location to a strip plaza on King Road (next to the church), tucked in a corner hidden from view. Bad move guys. Remember the key to success in restaurants is all about three things...

Location, Location AND Location.

\"Pant, Pant, Pant\".....Ok pointless Rage subsiding, Italo-HULK calm, now for the important stuff.

Upon walking into Tutti Panini you are immediately whisked away to a courtyard in the Italian countryside. The decor is beautiful, there isn't a detail left out. From the fruit trees coming out of the walls, the stone work, balconies, and even the classic furniture. The owners have really put the extra effort in here and it shows. Most places like this I will grab my food and go, however I love having a seat to enjoy my lunch, makes me feel at home. BRAVO

Lets talk Italian chow for a bit. As I have eluded too in other reviews, I am of Italian ancestry and proud. So all other foods aside I feel I have a better than average perception of determining the difference between the have's and have not's of Italian Cuisine

In Italiano, \"Tutti Panini\", means all sandwiches. Thankfully this is NOT the case here as they offer a full menu of classic Italian dishes (on top of a great hot and cold Italian Sandwich menu). You can order a fresh pizza, Aranccini (rice balls), pasta, etc, etc. However, my item of choice on the regular is their Hot Veal Sandwich. YUMMO

Their Veal Sang-wiches (if you're Italian you'll get that reference) are the perfect marriage of freshly cooked, made to order veal cutlets, served on a fresh bun and topped with BAWSE-Tomato SAWSE (yes folks I've dubbed their sauce BAWSE) and your choice of cheese and toppings. Che Bella!!!

One note on the food is that with freshly made items, you pay a penalty with time. I find a simple veal sandwich can take as long as 15 minutes to turn around. Great if your staying for a spell, however inconvenient if you're in a hurry.

I would rate this place a little higher, however I feel like the location and turnaround on food really impedes my ability to do so. That being said, decor and food quality give them a solid A-OK in my books with the opportunity to get a 4 or 5 once I have tried more of the menu.

End Recco.... Make the trek to this neck of the BURBS, the food is worth the wait and worth the search. Just think about how many places downtown you've searched for relentlessly. Go on. Give it a shot. You know you want it.

Buon Appetito"}
{"text":"I have to say that this is a hidden gem in Oak Ridges.  Unfortunately, like the previous comment noted, this place is HIDDEN in a strip plaza, well away from passers-by.  It took me several drive-by's down King Road before I actually noticed exactly where it was.  

The food here is great.  To be honest, I've only ever had the Tutti Panini (veal sang-wich with all the toppings) here, but it is great.  The sandwich is very fresh (made-to-order) and the fact that I can get it \"hot\" and actually be \"hot\" (unlike California Sandwiches) is a fantastic plus.  The price is very fair for the sandwich.  

Other than the location (the parking lot can get VERY crowded with the dance-mom's slugging their minivans and SUVs everywhere), this place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best veal sandwiches in York region and for my money the GTA!  We also use them for catering.  They never let us down and more than just sandwiches for catering."}
{"text":"I'm Italian but I really hate other people's tomato sauce and here that's the case too but!!! There pizza is delicious. Rice ball is really good too. 

There veal sandwhiches is outrageously priced with .75-1.90 per topping. 

You can go any Italian bakery and basic toppings are included. 

There food is never hot. Mostly cold. 

7.99. For a slice of veal on a bun. I'll never understand. 

I've work at an Italian bakery over 2 years and these prices are little bit out of range. 

Everything else is good prices 

Huge slice of pizza. 3.25
Arancini ( rice ball) $2.50! 

Overall pizza is beyond delicious so def will be coming back. Trying calamari today so hopefully that's awesome too

Update- calamari was sooo tastyless and soggy."}
{"text":"Always on the look out for a pizza slice

Pizza, Panini sandwhiches, pasta and even fish dishes are on the menu

Its a take out and sit down restaurant

I had a slice to go and well it was ok and the girl couldnt be bothered to heat it up

However, the arancini  rice ball was very good. Crispy on the outside and the inside held savoury ground beef and melted mozzarella cheese. The tomatoe sauce was ideal for dipping and then licking it up

Next time i am in the area i will give their hot veal or meatball sandwich a try

They have Food Truck that brings their menu to you which you can follow on twitter"}
{"text":"Good Italian Sandwiches.  My favourite is the Veal Sandwich with onions and sweet peppers.  Huge portion.  Great place for a quick delicious meal.  

A local favourite place and well deserved.  Will be back."}
{"text":"My regular take out place. Big portions. The panini is perfect. You can dine there as well.the pizza is good too, A bit on the greasy side."}
{"text":"You can sense the Italian theme once you enter the restaurant from the incredible design and decorations. 

My sister and I ordered the veal medium, with peppers and mushrooms. It was amazing! Considering the size of the sandwich, $7.99 wasn't too bad of a price.

The lady that took our order was very friendly and definitely knew the menu well! 

Would I come back? Yes!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch at Tutti Panini! Came here around 2pm and my mom and I were the only ones in here, which was nice and quiet. 
Beautiful little find! My mom ordered a veal sandwich which she said was very good and fresh. We shared a order of calamari-good size for sharing. Lightly breaded and served with cocktail sauce. I had a slice of pepperoni pizza, very good. Fresh and hot. I will be coming here again for sure! And the owner gave my mom and I a complimentary cappuccino! I would recommend highly."}
