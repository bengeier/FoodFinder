{"text":"Hands down the best BYOW resto in Mtl. bar none.   the food is amazing (i would stay away from the duck liver, cooking was not perfect) and the prices are very good for this type of resto.  they always have a nice selction of appetizers and entrees; i always end up taking the  5 course menu and its always UNDER 50$  never wrote a review before for this resto but i've been there for lunches, dinners and never was disapointed!!  5 stars to U"}
{"text":"Made reservations on Monday night. Arrived Friday without our name on the reservations. Was annoying since we had a baby sitter for the night. All other restaurants in the area were booked up. However, the guy at front tried his best to help us find a place, eventually reserving a spot at their other restaurant. We ended up at Etat-manger, the sister restaurant, arranged by the other restaurant. The service was excellent and the food was good. They were nice enough to charge us only the main course price for the table d'hôte. So in the end our anniversary dinner was great."}
{"text":"This is a hidden little restaurant in Laurier neighborhood. If you're planning to have dinner make reservations in advance as seating area is very limited. The menu & food is exceptionally delicious compared to other French restaurants and reasonably priced for the quality of food. The staff is very friendly and will make great effort to explain the menu in both English or French. Overall an excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Yes.  I said it.  5 stars!  We are Montreal regulars as our best friend lives in the city so we are no strangers to the food scene.  Each visit, I gruelingly scan every board, article and website to decide on where we will be feasting while we are in town. LQG has been on my radar for awhile, but this time, we finally took the plunge.    We were a party of 5 on a Fri night and yes, I booked my reservation two weeks in advance. We took later 9 PM seating.  Arrived on-time, with our wines (2 white, 2 red and a sparkling) and the waiter was quick to get us seated and drinking! He was French, from France I believe, and he was kind enough to read us the entire menu in English even though only 2 in the party needed the translation.  The tartare for the night was duck and it was delish. For entree I did the short rib which was equally as good.  My husband did the venison which was perfectly cooked as per the chef.  The desserts were equally as good.  The lemon tart was to-die-for.   LQG feels like home, which is the best compliment I can give a restaurant.  We didn't want to leave and we werent forced to. Perfect size, perfect decor, perfect staff -- I can't say enough about this place.  Go!!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  Every dish was delicious from the seared Marlin and duck tartare to the aged filet and veal chop.  The service is superb.  Given all that plus BYOB (wine) it can be the best value for a very good meal"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in a long time! The menu is small and changes every day. Our waitress was amazing and explained every dish to us and gave us her honest  opinion about each dish. I was pregnant and she identified all the dishes that would be good for me to eat.  I also love the fact that you can bring your own bottle of wine-- and that there is a wine store just around the corner.  We were also lucky in that we did not have to wait for a table!"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant m'a été conseillé car je voulais faire un bon repas pour l'anniversaire de ma copine. Il est PARFAIT ! Je cherche encore mais rien à redire !   Nous avons eu une serveuse tellement sympa et professionnelle ! Description parfaite du menu vraiment varié, et tout de tête sans lire l'ardoise. Repas délicieux, tout est superbement présenté et accompagné. On mange des choses que jamais on aurait pu imaginer, avec des combinaisons délicieuses. Les gens sont là pour vous, et toujours au top. Nous ne sommes pas prêts d'oublier ce moment, et je pense que pour un tel prix, nous ne sommes pas prêts de manger dans un resto aussi bien en tous points !!   Si vous êtes à Montréal, il faut vraiment y aller :)"}
{"text":"Simple and good cuisine. Well presented. Fresh produces. My favourite restaurant in Montreal.  Very good value for money (about 25 for lunch / 45 for diner). You must bring your own wine.  You must have a reservation.  Only cons: always a bit noisy"}
{"text":"J au vraiment bien manger , j ai pris la table d hôte à 40 . Mon repas principal le lapin était succulent et mon entrée aussi de cerf ou chevreuil . La seule défaut que je peut dire c est peut être la grosseurs de portion"}
{"text":"Highly recommend - might even be my new favourite restaurant in town. Surpassed expectations for the price range, with a reasonably priced table d'hote for an extra $12. Tataki/blue marline appetizer was declicious, as was the main course (veal with fois gras - one of the best meals I have had in Montreal). Crab cake appetizer was still very good, but not on par with the rest of the meal. Maybe I just don't like crab cakes in general though... Creme brulée for dessert was also amazing. Staff were very friendly and we did not feel rushed to leave at the end of the night. That said, there was one very enthusiastic waiter who kept coming by the table to re-fold our napkins when we weren't looking. Oh well."}
{"text":"Started with cold pea soup with mint, next zucchini flowers with the most delicate glacé, rabbit leg stuffed with veal, finished with lemon curd.  I am ruined.  I can never eat again.  I'm hoping to maintain this state of yum as long as possible.  Our server was so kind with our horrible French, mixed with Spanish (my second language?).  I wish I could come here at least once a month.   Why do we have to go home"}
{"text":"The most impressive thing outside of the culinary experience, is the staff knowledge and professionalism. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellant! Très bon service. Les assiettes étaient bien présentés.  J'ai bien aimé le potage au chouffleur.   Je voulais goûter au fois gras de canard. J'ai vraiment aimé. Ça valais le prix.  Le filet mignon était tendre et savoureux. Bonne portion aussi.  Le cheese cake était aussi excellent. Pas trop massif.  Saveurs et textures hors du commun!"}
{"text":"Je n'ai que de bons mots a dire a propos du Quartier Général! Le service était impeccable, la nourriture était fantastique et le décor tout ce qui a de plus simple.   Un gros merci tout particulièrement a la Maître d'Hôtel, Anne, pour son accueil, son amabilité ainsi que son beau sourire. J'y retournerai définitivement!"}

{"text":"Delicious food, great ambiance. There were additional charges on our meal that our waitress didn't make clear when we were ordering but other than that we were very happy with our meal. Definitely make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Un restaurant apportez votre vin que je qualifierais presque de gastronomique! Les plats sont bons et bien présentés! Les prix sont plus qu'acceptables (sans compté qu'on économise sur l'alcool)! Pour ce qui du service: toujours charmant et bien plaisant! Une ambiance décontractée et amicale. Honnêtement, que ce soit pour dîner ou pour souper, j'adore! Pour une review un peu plus longue, consultez mon blog (la boufferie)."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.  She was also spot on her recommendations.  The ambiance is excellent and the kitchen is open so you can watch the chef work his magic.  The place is BYOB.  I highly recommend the steak tartare and the duck medium rare please! A wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I've only been once. It was a date. It was an awful date. I'd still come back. Good food, cool staff. 3/5 because as it stands the city has better restaurants of the same nature."}

{"text":"I can't say that i enjoyed the dinner here, I felt like every plate is served with being healthy in mind, everything tasted very bland.  We ordered the cauliflower soup, it was served cold.  Didn't like it at all, I felt like it would have been a lot better if it wasn't served cold.  For appetizer, we got the tuna tataki, I felt like the tuna pieces were too dry.  Tasted very bland.  The black cod entree was ok, the fish was fresh but again I felt it was too bland.   I hate to give it 3 star because of all the excellent reviews, but this was my experience so I have to show it.  We went with party of 6, others did enjoy their food.  Three others agreed with my review on the tuna tataki and the cold soup.  We circled around the restaurant many times trying to find parking and we couldn't.  Had to park on the big street and walked about 5 minutes.  This restaurant is located inside a residential area, most of the parking spaces requires permit.  This restaurant was pretty busy but they did allowed us to bring the stroller in.  Service wise, I didn't have any issues.  Note: this is a bring your own wine restaurant, not sure if they actually sell wine, so make sure you call before if you're not planning on bringing your own wine."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant apportez votre vin.  Chaleureux avec une table d'hôte très variée."}
{"text":"Tous les plats étaient excellents, service impeccable. À la hauteur des bons commentaires que j'avais toujours entendu sur cet endroit !"}
{"text":"At Le Quartier General, for $50 you will be served a 4 course menu with 1 Michelin star rated quality of food.   That should be enough to convince anyone to run there as fast as possible. This place is the best value I've ever seen. Not only is the food incredibly priced but it's Byob which makes it an absolute must go for anyone in the vicinity of Montreal.  I am still wondering how those guys make money. I guess the fact that they're booked up every night including on a Sunday helps.   Now about the food. We first started with a soup, served cold. Tbh when I tasted the soup I was like \"Fuck, that was a bad pick\".. And then I got my seared foie gras. Perfectly cooked. Super flavorful. Fantastic. The foie gras was followed by a rabbit prepared carefully with a great presentation. Very good flavors. My gf had a memorable Arctic char. The photo does not reflect how amazing that fish was. It's gotta be one of those dishes you remember for good as one of the best you've had ever. Spectacular and surprising flavors. The desserts were also awesome and the drinks we brought made the experience even more fun.   What a gem!"}
{"text":"Quaint restaurant that appears to be frequented by locals. The cuisine is simple, fresh, and thoughtfully prepared.  I had the carrot soup, beef with risotto and creme brulee, and my date had the zucchini flower app and rabbit with carrot puree. The beef cut was surprisingly served on top a large bone and the risotto had a rustic preparation. The rabbit was flavorful and tender.  We enjoyed that we could bring our own wine and that it was an intimate setting -- great for a date."}
{"text":"Un très bon restaurant apportez votre vin. Les plats sont savoureux et originaux. L'endroit est magnifique également."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best BYOW in the city.. in fact, I really think it is the best! Reservation is a must: 2 services : 6:30pm or 9:30pm. Group are also possible, but be careful, it is a small place and the windows very close, the noise can be very loud at one point.  I liked going to Quartier General for lunch, it is a sure bet. You can choose from different starters and main dishes on the menu. The waiters will present every meal one by one in a very delectable way. The hard thing is to choose 1 only.  For the starter, they also have the Tartare du moment: Once got the duck, salmon, and the deer (my favorite). You can also add an little extra to have the desert and 2nd starter. (worth it all the way) I am not a sweet tooth, but seriously it's the best desert I had (nougat glacé is a must!)  For the quality, the price is more than excellent! Bring a good bottle of wine and enjoy your meal (tartare, meat, fish, risotto), with friends, bf, gf or family."}

{"text":"We came to Montreal for a weekend and had a special birthday dinner here and loved it! The service was impeccable, the food scrumptious ! Take your wine because they dont serve it there."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you can BYOB! This is a true french restaurant. Everything is in french and it was cute how the waitress explained everything in English for me. I came here for lunch (but I hear it's a great deal for dinner and there's foie gras). The lunch entree and appetizer was 20 Canadian dollars. I ordered the tuna tartare and it was absolutely delicious! A dish that was appealing to my eyes with the perfect amount of vegetables, a slice of a purple egg, and the tuna was moist. I felt like I was falling in love with every bite. I ordered a beef steak with frites as my entree and the beef was cooked to perfection (definitely \"medium\"). The frites were delicious and loved their aioli sauce. I liked this restaurant a lot and would come back if I lived around here!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful, cool Montreal bistro with fantastic food and service.  Creative cuisine, excellent portion size (not too big), lovely atmosphere.   The table du hôte menu is a great deal and the tartare du soir is not to be missed.  Bring a good bottle of wine and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yuuuummmm!  After listening to people rave about this place for the last five years, we finally tried it out!  Holy yumminess is all I can really say...  We went on a random Tuesday evening, and let me tell you, this place was PACKED. The ambiance is really cozy - menus on the walls, dark lighting, and it's a BYOW!  We had the full course meal, and both tried different things off the menu - everything was deliciously phenomenal. A tad bit pricy, but not expensive for the quality of food being served. Possibly one of the best BYOWs in Montreal.  You've gotta try it, but don't forget to make a reservation!  ps. The pineapple cheesecake was soooo delicious......"}
{"text":"Super carte, bon service et ambiance feutrée! Parfait pour un repas à deux ou entre amis!"}
{"text":"Not be redundant, but like everyone else, I have to give this place 5 or more stars. Excellent spot in the Plateau. Everything about it - food, service, atmosphere - is tops.  Starting with the food - they offer 3 courses: appetizer, main, and dessert. Do at least the first two, if you can go for the dessert, and have a coffee. From the appetizer menu, we had the octopus tart and the scallop. The tart had three chunks of perfectly done octopus on top of a pastry along with caramelized onions, tomato confit, and microgreens, served with a sour cream sauce infused with roasted garlic. The layers of flavors were terrific, incredibly balanced, and complimentary. The sauce in particular, with little salt, worked incredibly well with the dish. The scallop app was one big, juicy, perfectly seared sweet scallop in a pea puree. Fantastic. Tasted like spring.  For the mains, we had the rabbit/lapin and the duck/canard. Both incredible. The rabbit dish is a leg, prepared two ways - on the bone, and stuffed with rabbit meat that tasted of bacon. The roasted squash puree was a great accompaniment to it. Savory, juicy, delicious perfection. The duck magret is prepared to order; we had it medium rare. It comes seared and sliced, served with a rustic fruit compote, and a delicious  barley with demi-glace sauce.  For dessert, we had the apple crumble and the financier. The crumble was layered rounds of caramelized apple with rounds of pastry/cookie, served with a vanilla ice cream. The financier was our favorite, almond cake with a light cheese and served with a blueberry-maple sauce. the espresso was excellent as well.  They have two seatings per night, at 6 and 9. They also serve lunch on weekdays. Reservations are a must, since they have limited space, and word is clearly out. We didn't know about this spot when we arrived in Montreal but within a week, two people recommended it to us.  The service is gracious, friendly, accommodating (for those of us with limited French), and extremely attentive. They manage the seatings with incredible ease. The space is comfortable, laid-back, and unfussy.  Last but not least - this is a BYO spot. You bring your own bottle of wine to have with your meal. As a result, I could hardly believe it when the bill came - the meal for two described came to just over $90.   Located in a quiet area off the beaten path in the Plateau, I suspect this place will be very busy for a long time. In a city where we've had great meals, this was among the best experiences we've had."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with my boyfriend, having a reservation for the 9pm seating. We arrived a few minutes early, and were seated promptly. My boyfriend was taking me here, and he made sure to call ahead of time to make sure they could do something vegetarian for me, as the menu is very meat-heavy. There were no veggie main courses, but a couple of starters at least. We both opted for the table d'hôte, as it was only 14 dollars on top of a plat (all of which are around 24-30$) so seemed like a good deal. We both started with the cauliflower soup, which was nice. Then I had a beet salad that I really enjoyed (I love how beets are so popular in MTL at the moment!) and my boyfriend had a tuna starter which he said was amazing. For my main, the chef concocted a vegetarian gnocchi with asparagus, different veggies, and a delicious pesto sauce. The gnocchi was really good, with an amazing texture, and the dish overall was delicious. My partner had a fish main course, again which he thought was great. We shared the Apple & churros dessert (I LOVED the apples and ice cream, could have lived without the churros) and actually got our second dessert (the chocolate cake) to go because we were too full to eat it then.   Overall, the food was great, ambiance nice, and the service was very attentive despite the fact that they were really busy. Would definitely recommend to someone looking for a special night out."}
{"text":"En entrée, le tataki de merlin en croûte servi sur un granité de concombre et yogourt est magique en bouche. En plat principal, le râble de lapin de stanstead sur écrasé de courge musquée est tendre et juteux à souhait. Pour finir, le lemon curd est juste assez citronné, sucré et épais.  Apportez votre vin :)"}
{"text":"eat pray love  :Plateau:  Really, really good food is a spiritual thing.  Truly.  So be prepared to be blessed.  One week today I had a holy-er-than-thou meal at the hidden le Quartier général.  I say hidden because it's off the beaten path, as it were.    There are two things you need to know before we continue.  The first is APPORTEZ VOTRE VIN.  And in Montreal that means no fee-no fuss.  Second, reservations are mandatory.  Seatings at 6 or 9.    My sister first heard about Quartier from our hair-god.  He recommended it about six months ago.  And he has wonderful taste in food - recall Les Heritiers.    We arrived promptly for our 9 pm reservation - as did everyone else.  It is an understated restaurant with beautiful details.    Don't worry if you can't read or understand le menu du soir .  Quartier's servers are equipped to describe every delectable detail.  Our server was especially good - you can tell she genuinely loves the food.    And why wouldn't she?  They have so many brilliant dishes to choose from.  We finally settled on three different appetizers, mains, and desserts.  To share is to spread love.  I recommend the table d'hote (set menu) because it's only an additional $12 (onto the price of the main).  This meal had some of the most delicious things I've put in my mouth all year...pause.  Let's begin shall we?  Soup ou salad?  I went with the salad because I rarely eat enough veggies.  It was simple.  Greens in a really delightful light citrus dressing.    The appetizers:   Tataki de marlin bleu - lightly seared tuna with some sort of sour cream/creme fraiche goat cheese/chevre sauce and miso-glaze with some edamame.  Foie gras pol (an extra $10).  One of the best foies I've had served with brioche    \"Crab Cake\"  - perfectly fried crust with a delicate and subtle inside.  I love foie, but my favourite was the marlin bleu.  That white creamy sauce was O-mazing.  After a perfectly timed break we were served our mains:   Souris d'agneau aka lamb - not the shank but from the butt - yes...It was served with barley, and not the tasteless tree-hugging barley but the flavourful rich barley.  Beef 1855 Tender Loin - Medium rare boeuf with 1855 cheese atop perfect mush potatoes.   Cod with fennel and cabbage - Light as air but packed with flavour.  My favourite?  The lamb...perfection.  The apple crumble and cheesecake were okay.  I didn't like the shortbread cookie that came with the crumble - it was rock hard.  And, um, I don't like cheesecake.  Their vanilla crème brûlée, on the other hand, was magically delicious.  I let out a hallelu, hallelu, halleluuuu...iah.   le Quartier général really serves something special.  It's not just the ingredients that matter, it's what they do with it.  A delicious meal that makes you climax over, and over, and over again.  That's pretty insane.  Get it on"}
{"text":"No problem getting last minute reservation. Wonderful pulled pork croquette and nice soup to start. Steak and veal were the mains. They were good. Wasn't overly a fan of the pure but the meats were good. The dessert was just awesome. The apple dessert was quite great as well the creme Brule. Solid meal all in all. Table note was well worth it."}
{"text":"The Spot: Walking in off the street quartier generale feels like what my dinning room would be like around thanks giving, only bigger and full of strangers. The fireplace and dim but not to dim lighting give it a warm feeling. It is a BYO so be prepared to have them offset liquor sales with paying full price for your meal. Like many other restaurants of late it has the chalkboard menu but fortunately a well verse waiter came to explain every option and there are multiple chalkboards to avoid you hovering over other tables feeling something like the family dog.  What's Really Good: Now everything is very French and we didn't ask for any translations so we can't tell you if they can accommodate an unilingual but everything sounds amazing. You'll have trouble narrowing down your choices so going in groups may be the best choice. We were two and a third may have been the way to go.  For the record we ordered duck tartare, bavette d'agneau, filet boeuf and a surf & turf which comprised of duck and lobster. Not to mention the soup, salad and desserts which compliment the Table d'hôte.  Duck tartare was a perfect portion size, fresh and very flavorful. Coupled with mushrooms it's a MUST try. The bavette is fresh and well cooked but isn't killer and can be skipped. The entrees also came out very promptly, a pleasantry many restaurants ignore much like te bread which was wonderfully fresh. Nothin in life is worse than hard bread and hard butter.  Pardon our french but the duck and lobster is the f**king shit! The onion puree that accompanies it steals te show. I nearly forgot to share the lobster claw it's THAT GOOD.  We ordered the filet de boeuf rare. Its nice to get what you asked for and not med rare. The potatoes are fried in bacon grease which ma give you a heart attack but you'll die smilling.  Dessert time, marquise au chocolat and creme brulé.  Marquise has a fruit topping and an almond floor that reminiscent of a deluxe coffee crisp wafer. Its incredibly rich and will put an end to that diet you're working on but you only live once so go for it. Its a great sharing desert but don't be ashamed when you want it back for the last bite.  The crême brulé is great but most french restaurants will nail that dish so we'll advise you to take a risk and try something else.  Good luck and let us know what you think!  You'll want to know Their menu is written in french and the wait staff will likely address you in french, don't be alarmed they're quite friendly. They're open late and will take last minute reservations so don't settle for a sloppy poutine just because its 10pm and hunger struck. Lastly, like I mentioned above, its a BYO so don't forget to make a run to the liquor store first. There are two SAQ's on Mt. Royal, one open til 10pm seven days a week."}
{"text":"I've only dined here twice at lunch and the consistency is spot on.    I like the fact that your plat will come with an entree and for a few dollars more, you can upgrade to something more substantial if you don't want the soup or salad (both of which are perfectly good options).  What have I tried?  Steak frites, salmon tartare, seared fish, veal, beef tartare, calamari and shrimp,... Is that pretty much the entire menu?  Practically!    Oh, you can bring your own wine too!  How awesome is that?"}
{"text":"The best BYOB restaurant I've been to in Montreal. The effort they put into showcasing local producers' products is a nice touch. Apparently the menu changes daily, but if they have the Alberta lamb I strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"This review comes a little late, as we visited last August-- so almost 6 months ago, but this was possibly one of the best meals I've had for the price in my life.  The server did an incredible job of explaining the specials and was happy to elaborate when we had questions.  I really will have to apologize because since it was so long ago, I can't remember exactly what we had, but I'll do my best. I had a foie gras dish that was out of this world, my rabbit for my main was tender and juicy served with andouille sausage. My boyfriend had the surf and turf that was served with a roast duck leg instead of steak, which was a really nice twist and a lobster tail. Even the salads, which on a price fixe menu can be boring, were lovely-- the pickled vegetables in them added a little acidic zip.  Basically, we had a fantastic multi course meal for under $100. We tipped well since there was no corkage on the wine and everything was wonderful.. The ambiance was small and humble, but I really can't fault this place for anything. Especially the value. We will most certainly be back the next time we're in Montreal and I'll urge all my foodie friends to visit for a memorable dining experience."}
{"text":"J'ai essayé ce restaurant samedi dernier. J'étais en visite à Montréal pour la journée et je cherchais un restaurant qui était à la fois excellent et pas complètement hors de prix. En plus c'est un AVV, donc on n'a pas à se sentir mal de ne pas commander à boire! Je dois dire que la raison principale qui m'a fait choisir ce resto c'est sa note Yelp. Je dois dire que j'ai quand même été agréablement surpris, la nourriture était de très bonne qualité et bien présentée; les serveurs étaient extrêmement courtois et efficace (sauf pour la facture) et le restaurant était très propre. Cependant, il est situé dans un quartier résidentiel plutôt reculé et pratiquement désert et la nourriture même si très bonne et très belle manque de constance et d'harmonie entre les plats je dirais, et parfois même de saveur.  Je m'explique. J'ai pris la table d'hôte et mon mari aussi. C'est une option judicieuse puisque pour 40$ on a un repas 4 services. Au 1er service, nous avions le choix entre une soupe froide de carottes (que j'ai prise) très goûteuse et savoureuse ou une salade mesclun avec vinaigrette au balsamique et sirop d'érable (que mon mari a prise) très ordinaire, mais bien équilibrée (on est en 2014 toutefois, le mesclun balsamique-érable aurait du rester en 2004). Au 2e service, j'ai jeté mon dévolu sur l'entrée de caille 2 façons: suprême rôti (ou poêlé au beurre je ne me souviens plus) à la peau croquante et juste et assez salée et la chair juteuse accompagnée de la cuisse farcie de champignon, puis pannée et frite (la farce et la panure étaient assez fades) le tout servis sur de croquants haricots verts au beurre et une exquise purée à l'artichaut. Mon mari quand à lui a opté pour le maquereau fumé servi de je ne me souviens plus trop quelle façon, j'y ai goûté, mais je ne me souviens plus c'était comment je sais seulement que je préférais ma caille. Au 3e service, j'ai opté pour la côte de veau rôtie avec beurre de foie gras et poêlée de champignons sur purée de céleri-rave. La côté était très juteuse et sa cuisson tout à fait irréprochable, mais elle manquait cruellement d'assaisonnement, son beurre de foie gras était aussi trop puissant et trop riche pour la délicatesse de la côte j'ai trouvé. Même chose du côté de la poêlée de champignons: la cuisson était parfaitement exécutée, mais le goût n'y était pas (le chef de cuisine ne connaît pas le sel?). Mon élément préféré dans l'assiette était la purée de céleri-rave, onctueuse et légèrement sucrée; il est dommage que les autres éléments de l'assiette n'aient pas pu lui faire honneur. Mon mari quant à lui avait choisi, je crois le clou de la soirée: un râble de lapin farcis et légèrement fumé (je crois?) servi avec une exquise purée de courge musquée et un haricot kilomètre (dolique asperge). J'étais fort jaloux de ne pas avoir commandé ça! Pour finir au 4e service j'ai commandé la marquise au chocolat qui était très riche (mais pas trop, juste assez) et onctueuse, servie avec des fruits marinés un biscuit de praliné. Mon mari lui a commandé le cheesecake à l'ananas, qui encore une fois s'est avéré fort meilleur que ma marquise.  Mon verdict? Dans l'ensemble j'aime bien ce restaurant et je comprend qu'il soit très populaire auprès des résidents. Cependant, les plats individuellement peuvent être \"hit or miss\". Certains sont excellents, d'autres moins bons, sans être mauvais. Bref, je ne suis pas certain que j'y retournerai lors d'une prochaine visite à Montréal, mais ce sera surtout parce que c'est agaçant de s'y rendre et qu'une fois rendu et le repas terminé, il n'y a absolument rien d'autre à faire dans le quartier."}

I still dream about this spot. My family, extended members (bil's gf, a boyfriend and so forth) and I enjoyed this true delight together. The food was unbeatable in quality and price. Dear lord, I can't get over how good everything was!   They also had BYOB, and no corkage fee! Can you believe that? Yes, coming from Manhattan, everything is expensive. And perhaps if this type of sick-ass high deliciousness food with truly affordable pricing is the norm here in Montreal.... then perhaps its time for me to move!   Correct. You heard me right. Or read me right?  The food is so amazing at such a great price with not only BYOB but also complaint-free service? I might well uproot myself and move over to Montreal. Goodbye overpriced Manhattan! Hello tasty wallet friendly Montreal!"}
{"text":"Had the cold soup,  steak tartare, rabbit and creme brûlée-- one of the best meals I've eaten in a very long time    The place has an amazing atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"We had read great reviews of Le Quartier General, so we booked reservations before visiting Montreal (I recommend reservations as the restaurant was fully packed on a Monday evening). I do not say this lightly: this was the best meal I have ever had in my entire life. We opted for the $14 salad+entree+dessert to accompany our meal, which I would highly recommend. The service was incredible, the food was unbelievable. The servers actually looked to be enjoying being there- and were so knowledgable on the menu. For a 4 course meal, this was completely reasonably priced, and for such quality french cuisine the atmosphere was so relaxed and down to earth. Not only was my meal incredible, but my parter also had an entirely separate 4 course meal and his was unbelievably delicious as well.  In summary: GO. Best restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"For our big Montreal food discovery long weekend, Le Quartier General was definitely our favourite.  Two dinner settings daily at 6:30pm or 9pm, and set menus featuring soup/salad, appetizer, main entree and dessert. The serving staff are top notch and will attentively explain everything to you in English so you can make an informed decision, though it certainly doesn't feel like you can go wrong....  Our favourites from the night include the duck foie gras, steak tartare (an absolute winner), marieville duck (perfectly smoky and tender), and creme brûlée (creamy and amazing texture).  Best of all its bring-your-own-wine and unlike in Ontario, there's great wine to be found everywhere in MTL.  All in all, this was a lovely 2 hour dining experience and make sure you reserve in advance!"}
{"text":"Do believe the hype. Fantastic plates. Everything was packed with flavour.  We decided to come for my birthday and of course we only booked 30 minutes in advance because we were actually gonna go to Pégase down the street but decided let's try this one out.  We had a nice cozy window seat booked for 9 pm right at the back which was perfect as the restaurant was still a bit loud from a larger group. The place started to empty out so the atmosphere was on point. Candles were lit on each table with the lighting set to dim which gave me the impression I was back in Paris.  Our waitress was great! She explained the menu and each ingredient with such passion that I was excited just listening to her. We chose 3 appetizers the cheek, mushrooms & foie Gras. My favourite was the foie gras and mushrooms they both had really great flavours, but the jam they used for the foie gras was amazing, for sure home made and made with love. As a non mushroom eater they made me a believer. The fried egg oozing on to the mushrooms covered them nicely and was a real treat.  Our mains were the duck and rabbit. The duck was perfectly cooked with a pure and a salad. The juice of the duck was perfect. The rabbit was very well cooked and the carrots were nicely seasoned and cooked as well.  For dessert we shared the churro with ice cream and cooked marshmallow which was a nice treat.  Best part about this place is the fact that is a byow, so that makes it a must try!"}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations, only to end up extremely disappointed. First off, the waitress was very hostile, almost coming off as rude. Our order was wrong, and after our main entrance was collected, we waited 15 minutes before she bothered coming to attend us. When we finally had her attention, she was extremely impatient and disrespectful, attending us half-heartedly. I felt extremely rushed into ordering dessert. The food was not what we expected, and definitively not worth the price. We ordered the fois gras for 20 dollars, and barely took a few bites. The rest of the dish was unfinished, inedible. The best thing  here was their dessert, the marquise. Definitively never coming back. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Service impeccable, nourriture impeccable, emplacement impeccable. Un apportez votre vin qui vaut le détour. Et l'accoutumance"}
{"text":"Perfection in every way!  Who knew rolled monk fish stuffed with seaweed salad could be such a revelation.  The fish was somehow not overcooked but with a perfectly crispy crust.   It's ways off the main streets and more touristy places,  but well worth the extra walk. Plus, you get to stroll past some charming Montreal residences in the way anyways.   Go here and get anything and you should be pleased, I'm that confident in them!"}
{"text":"Great new place off the beaten path. I had lunch here for the pre-fix price of $20. It came with appetizer, main course and cappuccino  The food is awesome and so is the atmosphere.  Dinner is usually busier so try lunch here if you can. All the dishes are seasoned perfectly and no minor details are missed here in the food."}
{"text":"Foodie heaven! I cannot believe how exquisite the food was here. I think I got a little buzzed from the experience. The flavors and textures were perfection. The ambiance is intimate and modern. Sit by the window for great people watching. Lots of characters wandered by.   I took my 11 y. o. son for lunch with me while on vacation. He had some difficulty with the choices and the all French menu. But he enjoyed his steak frites. I had two of the specials: a duck tartare appetizer with orange infusion and an herbaceous creme binding it together with taro chips on top, and a sausage and shrimp dumpling main course with chanterelles and bok choy in an exquisite mushroom and veal gravy. I couldn't even talk. I just wanted to savor every bite. We finished with a delicious creme brûlée and coffee.   The neighborhood is lots of fun as well. We wandered down to Ave Mont Royal afterwards. Lovely mix of residential and little shops.   Definitely worth a special trip to eat here! Reservations are suggested, especially for dinner."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place with one exception. Every dish I had, save dessert, needed salt. Well made preparations, the side and condiments were wonderful but every piece of protein in every dish was devoid of seasoning. I had the lamb and the pork jowl. The chocolate mousse was perfectly delicious however."}
{"text":"Le Quartier General is a delicious restaurant with top-notch service. Prices are reasonable for the quality of the food and the fact that it is BYOW makes it even more affordable. Their menu changes on a regular basis based on in-season/availability of items, but it seems that they usually have a nice variety of vegetable, fish, and meat options. Our entrees were both excellent: my husband had a steak that was cooked to perfection with the surrounding flavors melding together nicely, and I had a lamb dish served with couscous that was phenomenal. The service was truly exceptional and should be how all restaurants operate."}
{"text":"Ce n'est pas un restaurant pour les végétariens, être conseillé! Toutefois, si vous aimez la viande rouge, vous ne serez pas déçus par le Quartier général. Il est BYOB qui aide à garder l'addition quand meme bas (28-30 $ pour l'entrée, 12 $ pour une entrée, 6 $ pour le dessert). Ils ont aussi un menu de 4 plats mais honnêtement, nous avons tous commandé que le plat principal et j'étais uncapable pour la finition de mon assiette (le steak de boeuf - délicieux, tendre, sanglante - l'un des meilleurs que j'aie eus).  Nous avons pu obtenir des réservations de dernière minute, mais faire appel à l'avance. Atmostphere charmant. Bon service. Qu'y at-il? ____________________________________________________________________  This is not a restaurant for vegetarians, be advised ! However, if you love red meat, you will not be dissapointed with le Quartier General. It is BYOB which helps keep down the prices (28-30$ for the entree, 12$ for a starter, 6$ for dessert). They also have a 4 course menu but honestly we all ordered only the entree and I was uncapable for finishing my plate (the beef steak - delicious, tender, bloody - one of the best I've had anywhere).  We were able to get reservations last minute but do call in advance. Charming atmostphere. Good service. What else is there?"}
{"text":"Its our second time at Quartier Général, and I must say it was even better than the first time!  We arrived a little early for the 9pm service, but we were seated right away. The hostess  told us it would take a few minutes before the waitress comes to explain the menu and take our orders, which I think is really nice (I don't know for other people, but I'd rather be notified of that delay rather than waiting and wondering if the waitress even saw us).  When she arrived, the waitress was actually really kind and patient with orders. She was also very friendly, compared to other waiters who can sometimes be a little uptight in those kind of restaurants. This restaurant always does it right: the seasonal menu, the variety of dishes... from the soup to the dessert, the presentation and the fact that you bring your own wine.   Everything is perfect. But make sure you book a week before! because it's pretty busy! But so worth it!"}
{"text":"Made it to Montreal this week and had dinner at this great small restaurant tonight.   Its not in the crowd area, kind of around the residential area. Luckily the waitress speaks fluent English so even its a full French menu (on the chalkboard), she explains to us what they are. We had the creamy tomato soup (served cold), quail as appetizer, rabbit and veal chop as main course, creme brûlée and a cup of macchiato as dessert. Everything taste so good especially the veal chop, I asked for medium and it was served exactly how I wanted it cooked, not too rare, not too well, just awesome. Creme brûlée was a good try too.   I was sick tonight so I had that \"upset\" face all night, hope they didn't think I dislike the dinner. I loved it, and I wished that they had one in Chicago.  PS: they don't serve wine there so bring your own bottle."}
{"text":"Great warm and cozy ambiance. Service was also great waiters very warm and knowledgeable in explaining their dishes. Food was awesome....beautiful presentation and taste was out of this world. Had the beat salad , carrot soup, and lamb...all full of flavors."}
{"text":"One of the best dinners I've ever had. Every bite was better than the one even before it. Great ambiance, impeccable service, friendly and hospitable staff, and phenomenal food. Desserts were spot on as well, always important at the end of a great meal. A must if/when you're in Montreal. It's even worth a drive!"}
{"text":"Like others mentioned, this place is BYOW, which is nice. My husband and I each got the full menus. The flavors are very fresh but I prefer a little more punch in my food.   I was very excited to have the foie gras. Unfortunately, the foie gras was very bland to me and if you ate it with any of the accompanying berries, you couldn't taste it at all. That said, my husband did enjoy it so i suppose it depends on your palate.  My husband didn't enjoy his veal very much but I did find the flavor of my rabbit nice, if a little dry.   The crème brulé had a great caramelization on the top and was our favorite over the cheesecake."}
{"text":"Toujours un moment agréable. On aime déguster les ingrédients locaux. Je regrette juste que le financier au brie ne soit plus là. Sans doute le meilleur restaurant de Montréal."}
{"text":"Wow. Very impressed. There's a reason I had to call 5 times before I got a seat. Byow... But the food is good. This isn't for the l'academie crowd."}
{"text":"This is a nice concept. Bring your own bottle. We stopped by SAO and got us a bottle of a Saint emilion red wine. It was very good. The service was good as we were seated immediately. We started out with the lamb carpaccio. I think you have to acquire the taste. Then we had main course -veal chop. It was tasty. The dessert was chcocalate something. See photo"}
{"text":"Delicieux et abordable! Nous avons pris la table d'hote avec soupe et salade. Tartare de boeuf. Tataki de thon et Gravlax en entrée. L'agneau et le Doré. Croustade et crème brulée. Pour le prix, c'est absoluement genial. Même la simple salade et bien equilibrée. Comme le menu est limité, nous allons attendre qu'il change avant d'y retourner. Nous recommandons fortement. Par contre le service de 21h est un peu tard pour nous."}
{"text":"2nd time eating here (3 years later) and it was just as fantastic as I remember.  Such a great, cozy space with the best food in Montreal.  Wait staff is absolutely amazing and super willing to accommodate my broken French (Frenglsih).  Standouts this time were the Pork Cheek appetizer and the Veal filet.  Cannot wait to return.  Best restaurant in Montreal, hands down!"}
{"text":"We originally had dinner ressies here Friday when we arrived in Montreal. But it took us a little longer to get into Montreal than anticipated so out concierge helped reschedule our ressies for Sunday evening at 9pm. This is a BYOB so came prepared with vino. The space is small but busy even in Sunday evening at 9! That's a good sign! The menu was meat heavy. But when we told them we had a vegetarian, they were more than willing to accommodate! Most good restaurants are prepared with one or two solid options for vegetarians. Two thumbs up! We started with the steak tartare. It was delicious!!! Hubs had the Nordic shrimp salad. Also very tasty and fresh. Mains were duck magret and rabbit for me. The duck Magret was done very well. My rabbit was super tender and yummy. Onto dessert! Nougat Glacé was the bomb dot com. My lemon Curd was really nice as well! Looking fwd to coming back here next time. Our waiter was super patient with all the questions we had and took the time to explain what everything was since the menu was entirely in French. He even made some recs on where we should go pick up gourmet goodies to bring home! Merci beaucoup! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Miam miam miam. Ce fut un souper mémorable!! Tout était réussi de l'entrée jusqu'au dessert, et le serveur était très gentil. L'endroit était un peu bruyant par contre mais m'empêche que ma visite fut très agréable."}
{"text":"We went to the QG on a Saturday for the 9pm seating and opted for the table d'hôte. The starters were delicious and the mains (the lamb and the filet) were arguably the best meats I've had. The filet was made sous-vide and as a result was evenly cooked to a perfect medium rare. The deserts were great and the service was impeccable. As others have mentioned this is a BYOW place making this quite an affordable meal. All in all this was probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Très bonne adresse si vous souhaitez un joli 4 services ! Le service était vraiment sympathique et les plats très bon ! Il y a pour tous les goûts a niveau des entrées ou dessert, que vous soyez poisson ou viande. Les plats sont travaillés et bien assaisonnés. Vous pouvez apporter votre propre apéro et vin en prime pour prolonger ce joli moment. Nous reviendrons sans hésitation et nous vous le conseillons."}
{"text":"Service impeccable carte d une fraîcheur irréprochable qualité des mets à tomber et compagnie fantastique ! Bravo j y reviendrai lors de mon prochain voyage !"}
{"text":"In case you've missed this: Le Quartier Général is BYOB. I repeat, there's no corkage fee, so please bring your own bottle of wine, or two! (You can purchase alcohol in Montreal at government regulated liquor stores called \"SAQ\")  There are two seatings per night, one at 6:30pm and one at 9:00pm. Reservations are a must! You can call or reserve online here: http://www.restomontreal.ca/en/3277/Le-Quartier-General  We ordered the table d'hôte which is a set menu that includes a soup or salad, appetizer, entree and dessert for an extra +$12 charge to the price of the entree. The portions aren't smaller either if you order the pre fixe, so you're essentially getting an appetizer, soup/salad, and dessert for $12!  This was honestly one of the best French meals I've had in a while, the flavors were delicious and the portions were huge. We were all stuffed and in food comas before dessert even came out. The foie gras on doughnut was simply ridiculous, it was literally an entire lobe of foie on a warm yeast doughnut. I would highly recommend both the veal and duck as solid entree choices, but I'd stay away from the crème brûlée for dessert. I love crème brûlée but this one's caramelized shell was too thick, leading to a jarring, stuck-in-your-teeth experience when chewing.  The best part was the value--a dinner for four, including tax and tip, only cost us about $200!  **TIP: Order the table d'hôte, the set menu that includes a appetizer, entree and dessert for an extra +$12 charge to the price of the entree. You're essentially getting an appetizer, soup/salad, and dessert for $12!"}
{"text":"Le Quartier Général... Mais quelle découverte extraordinaire!! Ça faisait vraiment longtemps que j'en entendais parler, mais je n'avais pas encore eu la chance d'y aller.   J'y suis allée mardi avec une très bonne amie et toutes les deux sommes restées surprises de la qualité de TOUT!! Le menu à l'ardoise est beaucoup trop alléchant, genre tout a l'air délicieux. Le service, hors pair. On a pris nos manteaux en arrivant, assis à une jolie table près de la fenêtre et après nous avoir servi eau et ouvert notre bouteille de vin (c'est un apportez votre vin d'ailleurs) on nous a expliqué le menu, bien en détail.  Après mûre réflection.. Le choix était difficile, nous avons choisi de partager le gravlax de truite en entrée, ma copine a pris une salade mesclun et l'omble chevalier et j'ai pris une soupe courge et lentilles et le magret de canard. Pour dessert nous avons partagé une assiette de fromages. Bien quoi... on avait encore du vin!  Tous nos choix étaient gagnants, vraiment! Gros coup de coeur sur le magret de canard. Les accompagnements étais fabuleux et la cuisson, juste à point. Mais en vérité, le choix est difficile parce que tout était délicieux!  C'est la première fois que j'y vais, mais définitivement pas la dernière!!"}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a local friend with impeccable taste, Mrs. F reserved a table for two at Le Quartier Général to celebrate our wanniversary.  We opted for the four-course table d'hôte menu and thoroughly enjoyed every course.    Excellent bread, even better butter. Salad was simple, maple vinaigrette, a few slices of cherry tomatoes and radish. Appetizers: Steak tartar, Matane shrimp.  Perfect.  Mains:Lapin de Stanstead - rabbit thigh stuffed with rabbit chorizo with fennel, carrots, bok choy, and incredible creamed corn.  The chorizo in the middle was a bit dry and overall I just don't love sausage, but the thigh meat was perfect.  Lamb from Alberta - cream, mint, a hearty grain, and some other flavors that blended together marvelously.  Very rich - too rich for me - but Mrs. F was ecstatic.  Desserts: Chocolate Marquise, Lemon Curd.  Lemon Curd was out of this world.  We were quite full by this point and the last few bites required effort.  ;)  Service was amazing, the small army of servers were extremely knowledgeable about all the menu items and were quick to refill water and pour our wine for us.  The table next to ours forgot to bring wine and the server was very happy to pour them a glass from our bottle.   The space itself was intimate and romantic.  I guess \"bustling\" is a good descriptor for the noise level - but in an exciting way.  The small number of tables and modest number of staff, with a semi-open kitchen, felt very egalitarian as opposed to some larger establishments.  Mrs. F observed that the cooks looked very calm.  Who wants to eat at a restaurant where the cooks aren't happy and all the servers are stressed out?  Not me."}
{"text":"Disappointing What I thought it would be: a nice little BYOB with great food What I got: a nice little BYOB with a lack of taste in the food  We went to Quartier Général an evening with a couple of friends. The restaurant rapidly got packed after our arrival and I have heard it's pretty much always full. The place looks nice, the menu looks nice and the waiter was funny, considerate and effective, anything you would expect from an excellent service. The disappointment was only in the food. First course soup or salad were both very good. Then the entrees were kind of sad. My friend got the smallest scallops I have ever seen, my boyfriend go the deer tataki wich was very thick and didn't have enough seasoning. Only my plate was good, the pan seared duck foie gras with homemade doughnut. By 1974, over two million students used computers in their classes. There was a generous portion of foie gras and tasted great, but it was an extra 10$. Then, there was the main dish. My stanstead rabbit was a let down. In my plate the carrot was more tasty than anything else. My boyfriend also got almost raw duck. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate marquise and it was pretty good. I know their menu tend to change a lot, maybe we didn't get a good week or something but the most important course were not impressive at all. At least the wine was good..."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience at Le Quartier General. We were a group of 4 and we brought our own wine. The ambiance is classy but casual, kind of felt like I was at a dinner party at someone's house. The food was excellent but I wished there was more! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent.  We are at Boulud the night before and this was pretty close for a lot less.  The beats and surf and turf were phenomenal.  Try the lemon curd for dessert if you like lemon.  The staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Presque du restaurant gastronomique mais sans les prix . Très bon rapports qualités prix . Attention comme beaucoup de restaurant à Montréal ils ne servent pas de vins , mais vous pouvez apporter votre bouteille.  Ils proposent même de vous mettre cd dont vous manger pas dans une boîte pour finir chez vous"}
{"text":"We had one of the best meals in Montreal here. I LOVE the idea of table d'hote -- soup, appetizer, entree, dessert!   And yes, they write their menu in French on chalkboards posted on the walls so you can hardly read them, but the waiters are so friendly and nice and will explain everything to you! It also helps that I studied the menu months in advance before coming here...   Duck was amazing!   Tiny place, make a reservation!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place to go!! The food was more than amazing for all of our party of 4. Everyone picked something different and we were all equally very satisfied!  The service was great and the Bring Your Own Wine concept makes it worth the little more expensive dish. I had the Foie gras which was amazing but needed a little more fruit/sweet. The fish and the filet mignon were literally the best EVER!!! We tried 4 different dessert and even if everyone was full, well we all finished and licked our plates after the Table d'hôte, crazy!! The atmosphere was great but very loud, not a romantic place at all!! Can't wait to go back. :)"}
{"text":"My fave BYOB in Montreal. Each time the menu changes beautifully here. My party of 2 adults and a 10-year old share everything. We enjoyed the pork cheek, which was tender but still had lovely density. The cod on edamame and spaetzle was light and full of flaky texture and wonderful citrus flavor. The duck breast was perfect medium rare with steak-like tender juiciness. Best service here too, attentive and efficient. - from a July 2016 experience."}
{"text":"WOW !!! J'ai tellement adoré ! Mon expérience, du service au dessert, était parfaite ! D'abord la serveuse que nous avions a tellement bien présenté les plats que nous voulions tout prendre ! Ensuite, nos repas étaient tellement bons, on se pouvait plus! (gros gros béguin pour le poisson du jour; je bavais! Finalement, les desserts étaient sur la coche (les churros, miam miam miam)  Le restau est tout petit, mais tellement beau, alors vaut mieux réserver parce que j'ai l'impression que cette endroit doit rarement être vide! Bref, je recommande tellement!!!   Félicitation au(x) chef(s), vos plats sont un délice!"}
{"text":"Best BYOW restaurant in the city. The food is consistently awesome. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food you get. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here for both lunch and dinner and I am a big fan of this place.  My personal favorites include the chocolate mousse for dessert which must ABSOLUTELY be tried and the calamari appetizer on the lunch menu.  Although I loved the ambiance, service, and prices, there were a couple of downfalls in my meals.  The worst one was the rabbit dish I had for dinner was very dry.  The creme brulee on the lunch menu tasted burnt, with too thick of a crust, not something I would expect from a place of that caliber.    However, by avoiding those dishes (and maybe others I haven't tried?) you can find yourself a wonderful meal at Le Quartier General.  My cornish hen cooked two ways was delightful and I'm sure there's other treasures on the menu waiting to be discovered."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant I have been to this year! The flavour of the food is amazing and it is a byow!!!  Had their beef tartare to start and he flavour was so well balanced. Rabbit as mum aim dish and it blew my mind...I had rabbit a few times before but nothing as tasty as throne I had here. The dessert was also pretty good...not overly sweet.  Service was also very good. Not one of the cheapest restaurant in town but definitely worth spending the money!  I highly recommend it and will surely be back :)"}
{"text":"Sur ma liste des meilleurs \"Apportez votre vin\" à Montréal!  Cuisine créative et savoureuse.   Situé sur le Plateau alors il est suggéré de venir en transport en commun, surtout en hiver. Sinon, prévoyez un délai pour vous stationner."}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic dinner here with my husband and 16-year-old son. Great service. Great food. It's pricy but totally worth it. Highly recommended for a special night out."}
{"text":"Fantastic is an understatement. 5 stars is too little. The service was great, the food was phenmomal. From the bread and butter to the soup to the dessert. Every bite it better than the last one. Their cold melon soup was so flavorful. The main course changes every time you go but it seems like the quality never changes. I look forward to going back! The creme brûlée is a must have!!!"}

{"text":"Mes attentes étaient elles trop hautes avant de finalement essayer ce resto dont on m'a tant parlé?  Tout d'abord, il y avait tellement de samba lalek dans la soupe a la citrouille qu'on avait peine à y distinguer le goût.  La cuisson de la côté de veau était parfaite.  Par contre, le goût était fade et il manquait nettement de saveur.  Les accompagnements étaient également sans vraiment de saveur.  L'assiette de crevettes et pétoncles était bonne mais encore la il n'y avait rien d'extraordinaire .  Au moins les accompagnements avaient eux plein de saveurs et de goût.  L'assiette de morue était elle pleine de goût mais on se demande justement s'il n'y en avait pas trop, le mariage des saveurs était honnêtement douteux.  La cuisson était néanmoins excellente.  Ce qui remporte la palme pour le souper est la marquise au chocolat.  Bravo pour la présentation et le goût sublime.  Un autre point positif peu nombreux dans le repas fut le service impeccable.  Bref, nous repartons déçus de notre expérience.  Peut être ai je trop attendu avant d'y aller...."}
{"text":"World class gourmet French cuisine. You can't go wrong when everything is just so right!  I love that it's around the corner from me, but I would drive across town to dine here; it is Sublime. & bring your own wine.   Must reserve well in advance."}
{"text":"A fantastic experience. The atmosphere and service were absolutely perfect. The food was good and all presented very impressively. Never felt so fancy at a BYOB establishment!"}
{"text":"We Were a party of 3 and everything that we ordered was very good. I understand why this place is so highly ratéd."}
{"text":"Emailing them is the easiest way to get a reservation at this place. Calling them gets the 'we don't have space' answer every time.   The restaurant is in the middle of a quiet neighborhood, but they have a row of meat and cheese places a few blocks away you can wander. They have two seating each night and they expect you to take your time.   Very reasonably priced with our bill being ~90 CAD for two four course meals (it is BYOB as well).   Waitress was amazing and knew the menu backwards and forwards with recommendations. Restaurant is dimly lit and very romantic. It does get a bit loud, but it adds to the atmosphere   I started with the salad (simple) and the sturgeon (the special). Sturgeon is an interesting special and not something commonly seen on a menu so I had to order it - it was delicious! It was battered and deep fried to perfection. I wish there had been an American style portion of it because I could have eaten it all. Not too mushy and not too much batter. I missed my husbands appetizer because I was so entranced. He had pork - he said it was okay.   The rabbit was a bit dry and boring. No pops of flavor anywhere - but it was beautifully presented. The rabbit came on a bed of popcorn and carrots - It didn't really work well together in my opinion. The carrots had a sweet glaze and the popcorn ended up chewy rather that crispy. The veal hubby ordered was fantastic. Very tender and well seasoned. Raab was the perfect accompaniment to give it a bite along with the creamy potatoes.   Churros were delicious (and huge!) and a perfect way to end the meal.   Overall, probably will stop by again and just order anything but the rabbit!"}
{"text":"Our friend recommended this place to us, as she is a local and comes here frequently. We ordered a four course (I think there is an actual name to it) and were not disappointed. Each course was prepared with care and taste was on point. Nothing was too strong or salty. Our visit was about 2 months ago so I don't remember exact details. I also wish I took food pics. For the main course, I had rabbit leg and my husband had duck breast. Our desserts were a cheesecake and some sort of lemon sorbet. Sounds plain, but it wasn't. Everything was so good! Servers and ambiance were also delightful! Perfect balance of cheer, charm and no pretentiousness. Best part - bring your own wine, without corkage fee. In fact, the restaurant encourages this! Will definitely be back when we're in town again. Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous meal at Le Quartier General.  I would sum it up as spectacular food in a casual atmosphere.   Food: the food is the best part about this restaurant. The flavors in the sides and dishes combined perfectly were new and surprisingly delicious. I had the lamb, medium rare, and the garnish was like a slaw which had bright bits of mint and other flavors that tied the dish together perfectly. The meat was good quality and cooked to perfection.  My S.O. Had the short rib, which was well balanced with the sides and delicious as well. However, we both preferred the lamb.   Both appetizers (soup and salad) were delicious as well, and the dessert (chocolate one) was sinfully rich and more than enough for 2 people to share.   Service: the service was excellent, attentive, friendly, and they had no problem translating everything into English, as we don't speak French.    Atmosphere: the decor is simple, sleek and homey, with a fireplace and a roaring fire at the wall. It feels almost like being in someone's home, in that you can peek  over the counter at what's going on in the kitchen.  (And all of the male staff are easy on the eyes ;). Seating is a bit tight and the acoustics make conversation echo, so it's a bit noisy, but not unbearably so"}
{"text":"Un repas mémorable!Meilleur apportez votre vin, pas loin de la SAQ Express sur Laurier.  J'y suis allé le 27 décembre. On était un groupes d'amis de 5 personnes c'était un bon nombre! C'est pas énormes mais on y est bien assit. Le staff est professionnel, courtois et amical sans pour être autant coincé. Le staff connaissent le menu et ont fort probablement tout goûté pour mieux servir.    Enfin, c'est situé dans un cartier très résidentiel au coeur du Plateau. Le coin est beau et p-e un peu challengant niveau parking, y aller en Uber ou en transport en commun c'est une excellente idée.   J'ai mangé un peu de tout, le porcelet gaspor, la joue de porc en entrée et comme repas principal, la Morue de boston. Je dirais qu'où Le Quartier Général excelle c'est dans le fait qu'il y a clairement une maitrise des techniques culinaires, les accompagnements originaux et sublime du plat. Les photos ne mentent pas; ça n'a pas seulement l'air bon, C'EST BON!  Un must pour moi. Calculé environ un 60-70$ confortable."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place, and am SO glad it was recommended to me by my host. This is French cuisine of fine quality, at a price that makes food like this otherwise inaccessible to many people. For only $12 on top of the entree price, you are treated to an appetizer and dessert. The decor is clean and modern, with an open kitchen that is fun to peak into. The service is highly trained. If the French is daunting for you, worry not, your waiter will very patiently describe to you everything that is being served that day. In terms of the appetizers, we loved everything! The salad was perfectly tossed and well balanced, the leek soup was refreshing. The short rib was absolutely delicious, the veal was melt in your mouth, fish was perfectly flakey, rabbit was seasoned perfectly (the only bad thing I can say about the entrees was the rabbit was a tad dry). The desserts were not as consistently wonderful -- while the chocolate mousse was absolutely divine, once you compared it to anything else, everything else was mildly disappointing.   Make reservations as soon as you can, they are often fully seated at least a few days in advance. Another great perk -- BYOB! They will bring out an ice bucket to chill your white and rose, and serve anything you bring to them with finesse."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting! Everyone here is very kind and is happy to translate the menu for those who aren't great at French. We opted for the prix fix meal, where you add $14 to any entree price for an soup/salad, appetizer, and dessert. My husband ordered the porcolette and I the lapin. Well, we were given the wrong the order and he was provided with fish instead of the pork. Disappointed. Since we waited so long, i simply switched meals with him. We told the waitress it was wrong and she blamed it on us and later left without checking in on her tables. Turns out the table next to us ordered our wrong meal, she must have duplicated the order. The manager of the evening ended up giving us \"free dessert\" BUT it was included in the $14. The service was lackluster and you end of waiting a lot. I suggest finding a new intimate French restaurant that is byob. I won't be returning. Oh the rabbit was delicious, the cod was not."}
{"text":"Service really good. they will describe the menu for you, so don't have to be worry if you can't speak French.  The food is fabulous. Everything here is worth to try."}
{"text":"This is truly one of the best BYOW restaurant in Montreal.  My friends and I went there at 6pm. We were sitting in a corner inside the restaurant, so it's a little bit dark, but with a small candle, the ambience is quite good. They don't have menu. All entries, main dishes and desserts are written on a big blackboard. We were sitting right under it, so it's hard to read it. But the waiter explain it to us very thoroughly. My friends brought a very old wine, 21 years' old. Because of this, it was difficult to take out the oak plug. Fortunately, the restaurant is well equipped. The waiter used a tool (sorry I forgot the name of the tool) designed to open old bottle of wine, so that the oak plug didn't leave dregs in the wine. Also the waiter help us to open the bottle of wine My friend prepared a surprise birthday cake for me. They asked the restaurant to light the candle and then to cut the cake. My friends and I appreciated a lot the service of the restaurant. The food was very delicious!!! The soup of the day is very impressive with a little bit taste of coconut and ginger. The duck is well cooked, neither old nor too raw. In one word, I highly recommend this lovely restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot to go out for dinner or meet up with friends. It's a BYOB which is always fun and the food is magnificent. The service is impeccable, instead of menu the server has explained in detail each dish and answered all the questions we've had. It was Monday and oh boy, was I surprised to see the place fully packed, yep it's very popular spot so I can only guess how busy they get on the weekend. Maybe it would be a good idea to book in advance. If you're in town, definitely check out this place, I dare to say it's definitely a memorable dining experience."}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan of this wonderful little French bistro located in a residential area in Montreal's Plateau district. I would suggest if you wish to dine there think about making your reservation several months in advance of your visit as this is a very popular restaurant among the locals as well as visitors to the city. It is ranked as one of the very best BYOW Bistros in Montreal serving some of the finest locally sourced products from the region. The service from start to finish was impeccable. If you would like to have a 4 course meal order the Table d'hote which means adding $14 to any main course will include your appetizer, soup or salad, a main course and dessert and with an additional $9 that would include a foie gras app. I went with the Table d'Hote and had a Potato Celery Root Soup that was divine, the flavors were well balance and came through nicely. My one observation was if you serve soup in an over sized bowl the bowl must be heated in the kitchen or the soup cools rapidly which was the case here, however; the overall taste and flavor was masterful. I selected the Artic Char Gravlax which was superb, the fish was nicely flavored with dill without a hint of being over salted; it was served with little dollops of goat cheese and a dill basil pesto. My main course was Roast Lamb from Alberta over a vegetable couscous with kalamata olives. The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium rare; if you have never had Canadian lamb you are in for  wonderful treat. The couscous was a nice way to combine the dish; it was very tasty with the vegetables being perfect al dente. For dessert I chose the Crustard: Apple Cranberry Crumble with vanilla ice cream, a wonderfully balanced fruit combination which was not to sweet this proved to be a wonderful way to end the meal. Le Quartier Général is a top notch 4.5 star restaurant experience they do a superb job and should be on your list when visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"Un coup de coeur! Tout était exquis de l'entrée au dessert! Le service était impeccable et l'endroit est très jolie! De plus, c'est un apporter votre vin, quoi de mieux!"}
{"text":"Lunch Special!!  Le Quartier General was fully packed on a weekday around 2 pm! If you are coming with a group, reservation is strongly recommended! But since I was alone, I just waited a few minute before I got seated.  $20 prix menu with a choice of appetizer and main and if one still have room for dessert is $5.   With the help of my waiter, I ordered the Tartare of the Day: Scallop and Meat of the Day: Bison with 1/2 frites and salad. Both were well prepared and delicious!!   Service here is excellent! My waiter is attentive and so friendly!!   I am definitely going to come back here for dinner as they have prix menu for dinner too!! The menu changes regularly since the ingredients are seasonal and sourced locally!  And I will be making a reservation and yes I will be ordering that foie gras appetizer!!"}
{"text":"Excellente adresse ! Service, choix des plats, présentation des assiettes, prix... Tout est bon !  Allez s'il fallait émettre un bémol (vraiment pour la forme) : les desserts sont à mon gout trop sucrés).  Réservation obligatoire ! Service à 18h et 21h."}
{"text":"Très décevant! Nous avons commandé le même plat de canard pour ma copine et moi. Nous avons opté pour des cuissons différentes : soit, médium-saignant et saignant. Malheureusement hormis la portion centrale qui était au bon niveau de cuisson, le reste de la pièce de viande est trop cuit.  Le plat était en somme médiocre. La viande correspond au canard Pékinois au Chinatown... mais avec moins de goût! N'oubliez pas seulement 3 ou 4 petits morceaux chacune. Le plat de canard s'accompagne de pousses vertes, trop similaire à ceux vendus chez Costco à 3.50$.  Au total, 110$ avec taxes et pourboires pour 2 personnes, incluant deux plats de canards et deux entrées (petit plat de calmars carbonara et foie gras). À ce prix-là pour une cuisine moche, nous n'y retournerons pas!  Même la possibilité d'amener une bouteille de vin, ne permet pas de compenser le reste. La place est belle et invitante, ce qui le permet une score de 2/5."}
{"text":"Great meal in Montreal. If you're looking for an intimate restaurant with strong French flare and a creative edge, this place is right up your alley.  We stopped in here on a rainy night without a reservation and lucked out as they were fully booked, but, one table had yet to confirm. That was our ticket. The entire menu is written daily o a chalkboard. It's short, simple and to the point; they offer appetizers, main courses and dessert.   To start, you get a choice of soup or salad, followed by your main dish. I opted for the cod - excellent dish. The execution was beautiful and the flavors throughout the dish were plentiful. My friend is pretty darn close to a vegetarian & only eats chicken and turkey. I know, I know... I feel for her, too. There was nothing on the menu she could/would eat and when addressing our waitress with this concern, she said the chef would gladly put together something, however, it's the chefs choice. Her dish came out: homemade ricotta stuffed ravioli. Almost knocked my friend off her chair, she thought they were so delicious. Everything was super fresh, delicious and the chef is not afraid to be creative and marry non traditional ingredients together.   A couple of things to note:  - BYO - Make a reservation - Vegetarians beware: heavy on the meat dishes   Awesome experience."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite restaurants in all of Montréal. I made my reservation almost a month in advance and was greeted warmly at the door by Benjamin, the awesome host that night. For starters, we had the yellowfin tuna tataki which was mouthwatering and amazing. My dinner partner had the foie gras which he said was the best he has ever had and I had what was easily the world's best crab cake: it was flaky, tender and had not even a speck of grease anywhere near it.  For mains my dinner partner had the veal and I had the sea bass which was done perfectly.   I adore the ambiance here: right on a quaint Plateau corner, small, unassuming, perfect lighting, cool tiles and even though it's loud, it's not so loud that you have to scream to your table mate in order to be heard. We will most definitely be back to QG."}
{"text":"Cuisine excellente! Bavette de buf cuite à la perfection...atmosphère agréable. Personnel accueillant et attentionné. Prix raisonnables et un plus à noter, on peut apporter notre vin....."}
{"text":"My top option for an authentic French \"bistro\" food in Montreal that does not break your wallet by BYOW! Why call it \"bistro\" rather than \"gastronomy\"? Despite the constant efforts to innovate on flavors and decors, the dishes that taste like french \"grandma's cooking\" always win, and they may not succeed as well on their creative side:  1st service: Cauliflower cold soup (creative side fail): I agree with previous comments that 'i'd better have it warm'. I've had many innovative cold soups / gazpacho before and this does not enhance the flavors or give any interesting texture when serving cold 2nd service:  Duck tartare (traditional side win): shallot, moutarde, wine sauce- totally classic and totally satisfying! 3rd service: Rabbit (traditional side win): Like grandma's cooking, it contains lots of \"Love\" = butter+salt+wine+butterrrr. If you're looking for gastronomy, you may say \"a bit too dry, too salty and heavy\". For me, it is actually super satisfying, especially when paired with a glass of old Bordeaux.  4th service: Chocolate mousse (win/fail- too full to tell)! At this point, i've been sitting and eating for over 3 hours!!! So the service is on the slow but bearable side, just don't plan anything afterwards besides walking some calories off!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of this restaurant with the excellent service and of course the great food and dessert!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Great bang for your buck. We tried everything on the menu, mostly locally sourced. Will go back."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday dinner. As the menu is only written on the chalkboard, we were very appreciative of the effort put into translating the details to us table side.  The ambiance was exceptional. The outside of the building covered in ivy was beautiful and inside it was a great mix of modern style. The place was packed yet we could hear ourselves and even made conversations with neighboring tables. They went out of their way for my birthday by giving me a candle.  The food was so fresh! They have an excellent 'combination plate' to get an app, entree and dessert. That's the way to go for both price and a chance to taste.  Great restaurant, I'm very impressed and will be  returning"}
