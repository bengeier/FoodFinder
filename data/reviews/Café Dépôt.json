{"text":"A classic café in a mall. Not the most relaxing area, but still a bit away from the food court, so it's not too much disturbing.

The staff was really nice. After I started sipping my coffee and realised I forgot to ask for caramel syrup, they added it in my coffee without asking to pay."}
{"text":"Good late night spot if you're having a coffee/croissant craving.  Central location, cice couches, TV and plenty of seating along with Wifi make this a better than average coffee joint."}
{"text":"A regular \"Café\", relax place, good for the wifi (well, one of my friend lives near by and makes sure that the free \"Ile-sans-fil\" access point near-by works well)."}
{"text":"Cet endroit sert du café, des salades et des pâtisserie. Ouvre à 06:00 ( lun-ven) et à 07:00 le weekend. 

Écran géant diffusant LCN ou RDI sauf les jour où c'est le foot (ballon rond).  À l'étage il y a un projecteur vidéo. 

Internet WIFI gratuit.

L'été une terrasse avec parasol sur la rue Sainte-Catherine permet de passer du bon temps. Par temps très chaud il faut savoir profiter des produits à base de glaçons broyés."}
{"text":"Visiting from the US we were glad t o find this place!
Ideal to relax, nice ambience! staff young and friendly... 
love the late hours..."}
{"text":"Fail.

Came here for iced tea. Why is it so difficult to find iced tea? Anyways, I asked specifically if they can make an iced tea, was told yes. So after telling them the two teas and sizes I needed, they brewed them in their appropriate hot cups and then handed them to me. I asked if there was ice for them \"ohh yes!\"

So she pulls out this tiny little plastic cup, maybe MAYBE half the size of what the hot cup was and said \"this is all we have for iced tea\" it was literally a sip. So it being all hot and steamy i just said fine, and watched as she poured all of the tea down the sink to put just a little in these tiny cups. 

Anyways, the rest of the cafe seems like a nice place to hang out in.

I think i am all set unless its hot tea."}
{"text":"I have been to this café a few times. The deal for the sandwiches and salads is pretty good. The food is descent. My favorite sandwich is duck confit. 
Never order ice coffee, they fill up a cup with ice, poured hot coffee on it and hands it to me. Results, you get shitty water down coffee. Horrible."}
{"text":"Café Dépôt est une chaîne de cafés plutôt sympa et depuis peu, on y propose enfin des cookies vegan (bien gros et vraiment délicieux !) et dans certains, on peut aussi y trouvé un sandwich vegan au tempeh. Assez pratique puisqu'on trouve des Cafés Dépôts un peu partout :)"}
{"text":"Café génial et bonne nourriture avec le service le plus amical ...Café Dépot is my go to coffee shop in Montréal, Canada"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a frozen frappé on a hot day. My raspberry with lime was a little artificial tasting, but it was certainly refreshing (~5$). 

There's a TV blasting current events.

People could definitely spend some time here working on the basic tables. It's not particularly comfy, but there's plenty of seating."}
