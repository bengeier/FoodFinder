{"text":"Just enjoyed a wonderful afternoon tea with friends at T-Buds. Having been at a few well known high tea establishments around Ontario, I find it refreshing to be in a charming small place with understated elegance, midtown Toronto, that offers quality.

The full set tea includes quiche and the classic 3 tier tray of fingers sandwiches, scones, and desserts. It is evident that these are prepared with care and respect; the bread was very thinly sliced which makes the proportion of filling to bread very satisfying, the petite four includes brownies, different flavours of macarons, spiced cake, chocolate filled cake and lemon tart. Every single item was fresh. The scones were light and delicious. There are also the options of a savoury tea or the smaller set of cream tea which are welcome choices.

What really sets this place apart is the tea. There are about 8 varieties in each of black, green, Oolong, white, Rooibos and herbal tea. Having grown up with tea and stocks about 20 different teas in our cupboard, I still sort the advice of their staff who were knowledgeable and friendly. I was very impressed with the quality of the Oolong I tasted. My friends had white buds, pineapple infused black, Ceylon spring and Earl Grey and all agreed the tea were great. They have portion the loose tea leaves and water temperature perfect for the brew. 

This is not a big hotel tea experience but one of the more satisfying ones for a tea lover."}
{"text":"A little shop above Bobette. We discovered this little shop while making a stop at Butter Avenue which we sadly discovered had moved downtown. This was a pleasant find and I loved their special 150 Canada blend tea and a nice blance of sweet and savory options. We went with some petite cakes and scones."}
{"text":"great selection,  attentive staff, and super cozy.  I came here for an event and it was well worth it.  will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I don't know anything about tea but let me tell you about the food.  Simply fabulous. I have had several varieties of the savory crepes and they were all absolutely delicious. I will be going back often."}
{"text":"I just had my daughter's 14th birthday party there.  We rented the room from 4-7pm.  It was wonderful.  Amena (sp?) the owner is wonderful - she was accommodating and very understanding with 10 14yr olds.  The food was excellent, tea was really, really wonderful and the service was very good.  I would recommend it for a a private get- together (there is a min charge for having the room) and I would love to go back and have a quiet tea with some friends.  Highly recommend t-buds!"}
{"text":"Relaxing beautiful atmosphere (especially the upstairs lounge), wide selection of tea, and a good addition to the Yonge/Lawrence neighbourhood. I like being able to purchase samples, since there are so many varieties that it's hard to decide what to purchase. The owner is really friendly and will tell the most captivating stories about where the tea comes from!"}
{"text":"I just got home from a wonderful afternoon at T-Buds with a friend of mine. We are both tea-aholics.  I purchased a coupon last year for T-Buds and finally had the opportunity to try it out.  We were pleasantly surprised! The service was friendly and informative.  She carefully explained the coupon deal and an option to upgrade (which we didn't take, because we wanted meals as well).  We both had salads. I ordered a salad with roasted chicken.  The salads were delicious; the roasted chicken was the best I have ever tasted: it was so juicy and tender.  As part of the coupon deal,  we each received a pot of tea of our choice:  my friend chose a green-peach tea and I chose an orange pekoe.  The tea was of high quality.  The other part of the coupon deal was a couple of scones each, with a cream and jam topping that came on the side and some fresh fruit. The scones were amazing! They were served warm and were so delicious. We were there for about 2 hours and felt we could stay all afternoon!  We will definitely be back and highly recommend T-Buds."}
{"text":"Great place, glad I found it and tried it out! Came here for brunch (though in reality, it was more of a late lunch due to some traveling issues) and ordered a la carte rather than the afternoon tea, and was quite happy with what we got!

Seated quite promptly at a pretty nice place - nicer than what I was expecting, to be honest. Bathroom was a little chilly. Very nice relaxing atmosphere though. My friend ordered an omelette with potatoes and I had the crepe with turkey and cheese (both from the brunch section of the menu). We also got a pot of mango lemon buds tea to share.

Tea arrived first, and I was surprised upon pouring to find it was a pinky red rather than a yellow colour! Nonetheless, it was very good - nice and fruity, just as I like it. It came with sugar on the side, but I asked for honey as well, which I think made the tea just a bit sweeter and just right for my taste.

Our meals came soon after and the food was really good. Sometimes crepes will come very thin and without much inside at all, but mine was quite full and was quite filling. It tasted very good. I also had a bite of my friend's food and it was also good.

We got tempted into getting a sweet crepe for dessert and ordered the SBC? The one with strawberries and bananas and cream. YUM, that was absolutely delicious! The whipped cream was amazing and it was a great way to end the meal.

Overall, very glad I found this place! If it was a bit closer to me I would probably come here more often. They have a load of tea choices so if I went again I would definitely try something new. Prices were fair, though it seems their website is a bit outdated as it said brunch items came with tea, while our waitress said it would be added with additional cost. Still though, one pot is big enough to share, and they were kind enough to refill the water for us.

Wish there was one downtown so I could go more often. Still, would recommend to my friends and come again. 4/5"}
{"text":"The place is tucked away upstairs with a very attentive staff. The woman serving us was very patient despite all the requests from our large group of six! The portions were huge for one person. The food was very rich and heavy as well. Definitely worth the $27+tax! Other places charge $50 for much less. 

T-buds also sells amazing loose leaf teas that you can brew at home. 100grams in a tin for $10+tax, much greater value for the price in comparison to David's tea and Teavana."}
{"text":"This year I was inspired to celebrate my moms birthday in a different way- with high tea one of my late grandfathers favorite things to do. So began my search, because she lived in North York I wanted it to be relatively close so Tbuds seemed like a good choice. It was a bonus that I discovered that it served halal ( my mom and my grandmother would appreciate that) .
Since Tbuds is located right on Yonge St I was not looking forward to the parking situation but luckily I found street parking right across. It's on the second floor above Aroma Espresso . You also have to walk up a flight of stairs for those with disability issues.  I had no idea what this place would look like but I was pleasantly surprised about the charming, cozy feel, loved the sofa seating around the table and the white linens on the table. I ordered from the Afternoon tea menu which was reasonably priced ( bonus) and ordered two teas with the accompanying sweet and savory mix tray and another tea with a smaller order just in case as we had 5 adults. Also ordered two regular sized sandwiches ( forest mushroom and Roast Beef) for my brother and stepdaughter because I honestly wasn't sure if the tea offerings would suffice. We were given great service, the tea was aromatic and relaxing, but the accompanying treats were beyond expectation. Firstly - there was a lot! Secondly we had quaint looking cucumber and cream cheese, roast beef, turkey asparagus, roast beef w horseradish and tuna mini sandwiches  to choose from; all equally delicious! The scones were sooo good , and I only ate them since my mom was raving about them. Our afternoon was finished off by two glasses of Sparkling Jasmine being presented to my mom and brother( Also a January baby). My mom thanked me countless times for such a fun experience. We all plan to go again and again !"}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience. I made a reservation and the staff were very kind and accomadating. The location is 5 minutes away from Lawrence Station. The restaurant itself is very small and crowded, I was melting by the time we got seated. The groupon deal was a set of tea, savoury foods, and then a 3-tier full of sweets. Alas the high tea selection was great, I got the bourbon vanilla rooibos (light and refreshing), my friend wanted the vanilla oolong but it was sadly out of stock. The savoury part of the set was delicious and filling (crepe and spinach quiche and their MINI SANDWICHES ARE TO DIE FOR). And the best part was the desserts. SO AMAZING ! seriously. I'm drooling thinking about it again. I don't really mind people listening to my conversations lol, but i do agree with other users that the spacings of the tables are a bit to close. The servers are A+ (they had no bias if you had a groupon or not), the tea, food, desserts A+, the interior and location are A-, the reason i can't give a full 5 stars is because i would not pay regular price for all of this, at 36 dollar (with tip) per person. But I would recommend T-Buds to all of my friends for sure!"}
{"text":"What a great place for an afternoon tea! The staff was fast, friendly, and extremely approachable. I have an allergy to fish/ shellfish and staff didn't hesitate to provide me with delicious alternatives. My boyfriend and I were given so much food we didn't eat for the rest of the day. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Great the first time, terrible service the second time. Took an hour to get our food, when the place was only half full. Good selection of looseleaf teas, which is a nice little touch to breakfast. Crepes are a little chewy, though the fruit is fresh and sweet. Nice patio in the warmer weather, which you dont normally have at a breakfast place.
I would like to think the slow service was an exception to the general rule about this place."}
{"text":"Great place to come for brunch. The food and tea was awesome. The place doesn't hold a lot of people but that's ok. This place has a great vibe and the staff are informative on the teas. 
My favorite tea was the champagne.
."}
{"text":"Got the groupon to come try their afternoon tea.  A great deal given the huge selection of tea and pastries.  

Food & tea: 
Huge selection of tea by type: black tea, green tea, white tea, oolong, puerh, herbal, fruit teas, etc.  It took me a while to select and the waiter was able to provide some good recommendations and description of the teas.  

Afternoon tea set for 1 person includes 1 piece of caprese salad, quiche, savoury sandwiches (5-6 types), 2 scones, macarons and pastries.  At regular price, its decent price for that amount of food but with groupon, it was a great deal.  Very filling. 

Decor: 
Lots of tea canisters adorn the wall.  It's a small place so tables are pretty close to each other.  Also, just a heads up, it's on the second floor accessed by a narrow flight of stairs."}
{"text":"Located on the second floor right above aroma in midtown Toronto, this cozy cafe was a great place to chit chat and catch up with some girlfriends. The area is awesome with loads of patisseries and bakeries.  When we went on a Sunday afternoon for high tea, it was filled with tables of quietly chatting women. My first impression was that this place was super cute! There were big cushy individual chairs with tables lined with white table clothes and tea served in simple white teapot and white cups. Cute parisian pictures and loads of tea leaves are on either sides of the walls. Its not as fancy as the other places in Toronto , but I think the price was very reasonable! For $27 (approx) you get a choice of your own tea, 6 sandwiches, scones w jam and creme mascarpone, 2 petit fours, a small quiche and fresh fruit. Sandwiches come in a variety of the classic types plus a few unique rolls. :) I liked most of the sandwiches :) and the creme mascarpone, jam and fresh scones were heavenly!!!  They have a wide selection of teas and they also have a unique section of teas depending on your \"life stage\". I know I mentioned that when I went it was full of females but they also have a small section of teas \"just for men\"! I think that's pretty considerate! :) 
I ordered an earl gray creme de caramel which was delightful! I forgot which ones my friends chose hehe but the staff are super nice! 

Overall we had a wonderful tea time on a Sunday afternoon with some girl friends without breaking the bank! Definitely go for the scones with creme mascarpone and jam!! Its just so delicious and floaty!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't have discovered T-Buds if it wasn't for my first Yelp UYE of 2013 hosted by Janna!

The space was bright and modern.  It's more of a hip dessert cafe and not a traditional tea room.  Because of the price point there were lots of young people here (mostly ladies) for tea.  

It's not a traditional high tea experience, but you have a fantastic assortment of teas, salads, hot eats, crepes, and the option of high tea eatables for a quasi-afternoon tea experience. 

The cafe is cute and a lot larger than expected.  
There is lots of seating on the first and second floor.  I would still call ahead though, they were busy.

I went for the savoury cream tea menu ($16)

This included:
* a pot of tea
* two scones with creme fraiche and jam
* fruit (a raspberry, strawberry)
* six finger sandwiches

The scones were surprisingly good.   But, I wish the creme fresh was actual clotted cream... it wasn't quite the same (but it's only $16).  Also, they don't give you much cream or jam, so you may want to ask for more.

The sandwiches were small and the bread was slightly dry.  The sandwiches served were cucumber-cream cheese and tuna.

For $24 dollars afternoon tea menu, you also get quiche, petit fours, and sparkling jasmine tea.  It's a way better value and the items are served on a tiered platters.  I would probably go for this option next time if I don't get a crepe which were super popular and looked fantastic.

I'll definitely be back for afternoon tea and maybe some loose leaf oolong milky way for home."}
{"text":"My friends and I came for high tea and it was worth! It comes with an assortment of finger foods that taste delicious and cute little desserts like macarons on the top. It also came with a tea of your choice!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for the classic afternoon tea for two. It was okay, but for both of us it missed the mark in a few important ways. The tea service itself was generally sub par, starting with the menu of teas to choose from.  There were no small samples of the teas to inform the guest of the hints of the aromas and not even a description of the teas the server has experienced or might pair well with their selection of quiches, sandwiches, scones, and sweets. The servers at T Buds were pleasant enough, I suppose. This touch may seem small but it is an important one as it sets the tone the rest of your afternoon tea. The sandwiches were average, and we were informed they were made ahead. The first plate had of all things cheese and crackers. No explanation of the cheese and why it was served with what looked to me to be Brenton crackers. The tableware was not clean, when we sat down I immediately noticed that there was lipstick on my tea cup. It was replaced as soon as I brought it to our server's attention. The first plate that came out also had a green smudge on it, as did the champagne flutes that arrived to end the afternoon tea. The whole experience left us feeling distracted, not really pampered and focussed on the soothing tea,gazing out the window as we talked, transfixed on the Aroma cafe signage waving in the window.

In T Buds favour, I can say the scones were good as were our pots of tea. Their display of the book culinary tea caught my eye and curiosity. Their restroom is beautiful. So much so that it made me fantasize that our visit would be much improved if the entire place was done up in the style of stone. Something of a stone floor and wall that conjures something serene like a ryokan. That would be an experience to come back for.

We both went in hoping for something special outside the afternoon teas that are attached to hotels, but were greeted with the dowdy offerings of an eccentric relative who had only learned of the existence of afternoon tea from super market magazines."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend after finding a groupon for the chocolate afternoon tea. At first, I was skeptical about whether I would enjoy it because I'm not the hugest fan of chocolate. I made a reservation ahead of time.

When I first walked in, I was impressed by how it was renovated. I remebered it was very vintage and floral (we saw a group of girls dressed up in lacy clothes for tea). We were sat down at a small table with huge sofa armchairs. They gave us the tea selection which was a very long list each with their own description and a waitress outlined what the menu would be. 

The tea was flavourful and unique. However, it got cold soonly after both in the pot and cup. I also don't know if I could ask them to refill it with hot water. I remember the the presentation of the tiers of food was very pretty and intricate. However, the taste was a little on the mediocre side. 

We were able to have a really nice long chat in a quiet and beautiful setting. We ended up staying for a few hours, way after we finished our food. It was also a good place to take photos."}
{"text":"We introduced two twenty-somethings to the full English tea and had them licking their chomps through each of the three tiers. Impressive sample of sandwiches, scrumptious scones and delicate macarons and tartlets. Excellent knowledgeable service and atmosphere for conversation. A big hit."}
{"text":"This place is a very quaint yet lovely.  I took my kids with a few friends and they absolutely loved it.  We had the week day afternoon tea and it was a very large portion.  Easily shareable. Excellent assorted sandwiches and dessert.  The added bonus, it's halal.  The kids ordered hot cocoa which was amazing.  I would love to go back."}
{"text":"Overwhelmed servers seem to have to assemble orders, seat clients and clear tables. service goes by the wayside. Having high tea here and not only is the 90s jazz fusion elevator music a pure annoyance but so is the lack of attention to detail. I wont return, there are much better places for mid afternoon tea and snacks with white glove service. Took over 10 mins to seat us and another ten to take our tea order with no instructions on how to steep it. finished the pre made sandwich with stale bread and scone lunch and now have been waiting for 15 min with empty cups and plates for dessert. 
I'm utterly confused.


Ps It's been another 10 mins, still we haven't been addressed and also since then there was an awful loud drilling construction sound while we wait. Help. Me. Now.

Editing this review for the third time and changing the star to a straight up one because every table around us who was seated after us had dessert. There are FOUR TABLES. Scam alert."}
{"text":"A cozy little tea shop, With a homely feel. I took my mom for afternoon tea at my girlfriends recommendation and was not disappointed. Prices are fair and the staff is friendly. They have a good selection of teas and a light menu, we had the full afternoon tea with scones, sandwiches, macaroons, little cake and some fresh marscapone cheese and raspberry jam on the side. Everything tasted fresh, flavourful and well made. My only negative is that it can get a bit crowded for a smaller tea shop, and can get a tad bit slow, the tables are seated close and I often found it difficult to hear my own conversation while the table behind me had theirs. Overall a nice experience and a great spot to grab brunch or tea with anyone that enjoys tea or wants the British afternoon tea experience."}
{"text":"Came here the other day for lunch tea time for two Groupon at around 11:30am with a reservation 


Pros
Good selection of tea
Employees were polite 
Almost all items tasted good
Fairly quick service 

Cons
Without the groupon it would be fairly expensive for what was offered given its $30/person"}
{"text":"Had Afternoon Tea here today. It's important to make reservations, probably about 2 days in advance. We enjoyed the large selection of teas. The quiche and desserts were also nice. The location is essentially good...located at Yonge and Lawrence.
The size of the room is not huge, and we happened to be a party of 3 with a huge party of females, probably about 15 in the party in the restaurant as well. They were extremely loud and rather inconsiderate of the other guests.  Thank goodness the party left after about an hour of this loud talking and squealing laughter, leaving us in a much more relaxed pleasant atmosphere.  This is not at all the fault of the restaurant, but it is not a large space, so you might be interested in this.  As well from an accessibility perspective, it is upstairs with no elevator or escalator. So people with ambulatory problems, beware.
Service was good as well. The sandwiches selection could be a bit more unique and fresh, otherwise I would give them a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I came here this evening for their \"Classic Afternoon Tea\", and my very first afternoon tea experience. Since they were booked up until 5pm (holiday season), I had some pretty high expectations despite being aware that this was no high-end hotel. 

Pros: My black cocoa-caramel tea was quite nice. The presentation of the 3 tiers was pretty nice. The scones were soft. It's a small and cozy environment.
Cons: All the sandwiches tasted very dry, as though the bread was really stale. The service was just OK. The waiter there seemed a bit annoyed at any request (eg. a refill for hot water for the tea), but what really got me was that there was a strong push by the staff to leave by 7 pm since we were the last ones there (they close at 8pm). It's also fairly expensive for what you're getting at $29/person. 

Also, although I didn't really mind this aspect, don't come expecting any fancy china.

Overall, I found myself disappointed by the experience because of the service and the high cost (No Groupon deal on hand!)"}
{"text":"I came here for an event and it was really great. I don't believe the menu they served is on their normal menu but it was out of this world. They served us sparkling champagne made out of tea, a normal tea of our choice, a poached pear dessert and much more. 

They offered us options for the appetizer, entrée and dessert.

I would highly recommend hosting an event at TBuds. 

I also purchased a tin of tea to take home and it is really delicious."}
{"text":"Picked t-buds for a workplace outing, the 5 of us ladies had a great time. They were very accommodating and even put together a vegan cream tea option. Four of us split the classic and the chocolate afternoon tea. Plenty of food for us all, the quiches and mini sandwiches were delicious, petite fours were lovely, and the macaroons were chewy yumminess. The chocolate crepe was a hit with some, the canape was a skewer of tomato, basil and mozzarella. The sparkling tea was refreshing and delicious, and for the pot of tea I would highly recommend the vanilla bourbon roibos. The bill split 4 ways came up to (taxes included) 18/person, which was very reasonable. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"T-Buds is my most favorite high tea place to go to whenever we are in the mood. From the cozy space to the amount of food you get and the prices - who wouldn't love to go for afternoon tea here!

Space:
The space is tight, don't get me wrong but it's very cozy. There are big window's to light up the room and the seating is so comfortable that you never want to leave. You are able to hold larger parties or even go with 1 other person as long as reservations are made. From the outside, T-Buds doesn't look like the cutest place in the world but on the inside, it's very calming and relaxing. 

Food:
Typically, when we go here, we order the afternoon tea special. In this special you receive a 3 tier of delicious goodies (fruits, macaron's, scones, lemon bars etc), mini sandwiches, a tea of your choice, quiche and even champagne. From the scones being buttery and not dry to the macaron's being delicious, t-buds has the best afternoon tea service. The best part about all of this is that they serve HALAL meat in the sandwiches and let me tell you, the sandwiches are AH-MAZING!! My favorite one is the chicken curry one - super delicious!

Service:
Although I do feel that T-Buds has the ability to seem short staffed, you can tell they are working their hardest to service every table. I think a few extra waitresses on the floor will help with service to improve. 

Overall, a great experience for me and others I've taken - everyone seems to love T-Buds! Definitely beats Moroco Chocolat."}
{"text":"My friends suggested that on my next visit to Toronto, T-Buds would be a nice place to have afternoon tea. I've been to a number of traditional and contemporary tea services and T-Buds was okay, at best. It is overpriced for the selection/number of items you receive. The decor wasn't spectacular and I didn't care for the white sheet of paper on the table for spills, or the small teapot. The $29 Afternoon Tea was underwhelming. The scones were good but a bit dense; some of the scones were not cooked through and doughy in the centre; there was only one little container of clotted cream and one jam that could barely cover 2 scones, let alone 4; for dessert, 2 macaroons, 1 tart and 1 cake were extremely disappointing. The sandwiches and jasmine sparkling tea elevated his review from a one star."}
{"text":"They charge extra for gluten free flour. 
Initially they didn't say they charge the first time I booked them. Now the second time, they discriminate to ask $5 extra. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with my husband for their classic afternoon tea at $29/person.  

Pros:
-sandwiches were tasty
-scones were excellent
-excellent presentation of the 3 tiers 

Cons:
-cream of earl grey tea I chosen wasn't good
-petit fours were poor in taste (macaroons was hard, chocolate brownie was close to rock hard)
-lacking traditional China teapots and cups
-decor is not your typical English high tea setting 
-seating is tight as you're sitting very close to the table next to you and behind you making you involuntarily hearing other people's conversations
-3 of the sandwiches we wanted were not available
-would have liked if scones were served with clotted cream instead of their creme mascarpone
-found an eyelash underneath in one of the fruit cups (wasn't a biggie to me but I'm sure others may find this gross)
-my teacup wasn't cleaned well as there was tea stain at the bottom

The price in comparison with other high tea places out there is quite reasonable but it really doesn't come close to when being compared to higher end high teas, but I guess that's the price difference you are paying for.  

This place is really just OKAY for me to have given it a try and experience here but we wouldn't be returning as a few of my high tea requirements aren't met here such as the ambience and the nice fancy fine bone China teapots and teacups aren't used here definitely took away from my high tea experience.  

I would recommend to owner to ensure more careful handling of food to avoid future hairs of any sort to be in food and to clean the teacups better."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for tea and crepes and it was a lovely evening out. We were seated on comfy couches and the table was fancifully set. Even the side plate took the shape of a tea bud.

I had the Great Caesar crepe and didn't really think it was anything special. I couldn't really taste the caramelized onions and the presentation was not very good, either (see photo). My friend had the Moghul crepe and we sampled each others and I really liked her Indian inspired spicy curried crepe. For dessert we had the Vanilla Bomb, which was a terrific crepe wrapped around ice-cream and drizzled with chocolate and strawberry sauce. What would have made it amazing would have been to add crushed almonds inside. We each had the vanilla bud tea and the chocolate mint tea, which were both divine. I also bought a canister of the rooibos sweet spice tea and it was very nutty and flavourful.

Service was good, the ambiance was relaxed, and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Won't come back. I have been here three times and I have come back because I truly want to like this place. Can't do it.

1) They got my bill wrong twice. Didn't notice until I had already entered the subway...didn't bother to go back for the $4. Two out of three times overcharging me...not impressed.

2) Food is overpriced and mediocre. I have not done the 'afternoon tea' myself, but I have seen others order it. For $25 a person, I was literally shocked at what they were getting. 

3) Service left something to be desired.

3) The tea is good, but there is plenty of tea houses with delicious teas with better service, better prices and most importantly....better tasting food."}
{"text":"Mother's Day menu was delicious and worth it. So much food, perfectly presented. Service is great and not pretentious. Tea selection is also great."}
{"text":"Maybe due to the really crappy rain storm during our day of visiting may have dampened my mood a little. My friend and I came on a deal voucher to try our first tea experience. We got choice of seating so we sat in the couches, close to another table but their conversation never came into ours. The waitress was very prompt, we made our order and the tea came out pretty quickly. However the timing for our main treats to come out came a bit longer then I figured it would. But when it did come out, it was a bit sparse in my opinion. The scones were very good, the other desserts definitely looked and tasted like they were from a grocery store. It would have been nice to have been given a choice to add in $ to upgrade to the full tea menu. Tea was good i ordered the vanilla rooibus tea. It didn't stay hot very long so we drank cold tea later on our outing. The waitress came by with a tea sample of a orchid oolong tea. The service is really good and when i dropped my knife/fork she came out with another set without even hesitation from the back.

Was a nice experience, but I think I will continue to try other tea places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Ambience & decor: Contemporary, tastefully simple. 

Beverage: The tea menu is extensive, including black tea, green tea, white tea,  oolong, puerh, &, herbal tisanes.

Food & service: Staff is friendly. The food menu is extensive and varied. This is unlike many other tea places I've been to. They have afternoon tea, chocolate tea, savory tea, crepes with tea. You can order petit-fours with tea as well. They have a good selection of vegetarian sandwiches.
They have weekday brunch with a pot of tea for only $10, which is a great deal. 
I ordered their chocolate tea which came with sandwiches, spinach/feta quiche, savory crepe, chocolate scone, cranberry scone, brownie, chocolate croissant, rose macaroon, &, fruits. The petit-fours were par-excellence!
An excellent tea place with a good value for the money charged.  

I have been looking for a good tea place like this to go and found one."}
{"text":"Awesome halal creperie....good brunch options....definitely get the big uptowner. If you know your Indian food, pass on the \"mughal\" :-) tea menu is extensive, would be a good spot to chill at night also"}
{"text":"Calm, casual simple setting. Afternoon tea came with a lovely entree, and the sandwiches and scones were good. The service was friendly, and there is a wide selection of teas.  Didn't try the crepes, but they looked great. I'd like to go back some time."}
{"text":"Generally I like this place, but I need to go again to get a better feel. All signs point towards it being pretty good, including the location, price point and offerings (tea+eats).

Went here for lunch and had an Arabian Bazaar Savory Crepe. The crepe itself was nice and soft with plenty of lamb within it. I liked the two kinds of chutney included; there was a yogurt based one and looks like tomato based one. The tomato based one is better.

They offered us a free sample of their Mango Tango ice tea which was quite nice, the aroma definitely smells more than the taste. But I find that's the case for all teas at David's tea too, so no change.

The service was decent, though the place wasn't too busy. I'm not sure what's going on downstairs though, must be construction as only the upstairs is open.

Would be good to go try again, the afternoon tea is $25pp.

This place is walkable from Lawrence TTC station, but it's not a very close walk. In summer heat it can get a little hot and in winter months, can be a bit cold. But I guess the clientele are mostly going to be driving.

What I notice now though is the crepe I had is $1 more now than it is on the website ($9 on website, $10 in store); website I guess needs an update or really I guess the store menu since I'd rather pay $9."}
{"text":"T-Buds is a much needed addition to this midtown area. 

While I'm thrilled with the recent (read: up to 5 years old) interest in teas, the rise in over-scented and novelty flavoured teas have irked me as a casual tea enthusiast. 

The traditional knowledge of Assamese, Korean or Sri Lankan Tea as far back as thousands of years is not to be compared with tea kitschily-titled Christmas Cuddles and Chocolate Hugs for the middle-aged midwestern Folgers lover. 

This is why I was very apprehensive of trying out T-Buds, as a tea emporium, particularly in this area. I'm so happy to write that I was extremely surprised with the results. 

T-Buds is a very cute tea cafe with a very well executed food pairing menu. Along with their very long list of traditional teas, they serve lattes and other specialty drinks. They also have a wide range of crepes, traditional afternoon tea snacks and salads. 

I tried the Assamese Malt tea with a savory crepe, the name of which I can't recall, but its quite safe to say that the savory crepes are well worth it. The tea was delicious and the service was fantastic. I didn't have to request extra hot water at any point.

I will return and in the meantime recommend T-Buds to all of my friends. Make sure you make a reservation, though. Try the Darjeeling, Japanese Sencha and the Puerh teas. You'll thank me for it.

Study/Work friendly? Not the upper level."}
{"text":"T-Buds will suit you perfectly if you seek a modest creperie with tasty options, but you also want pretentious/uninterested service and you also want to show off to your friends how much money you make, because the prices are pretty high for what you get.

And that was a bad analogy, because I don't make much money.

I probably felt awkward in here because there were two total parties in the restaurant: my party of two, and the birthday party of around 12 (mostly kids, kill me). It felt like we were interrupting their party, and you know how hard it is to talk when there's a whole bunch of loud nonsense going on at the table next to you when you dine out.

To be fair, of course, The Obnoxious Party had nothing to do with the restaurant. We had eaten our dinner somewhere else, and came here for after-dinner crepes. I went with an interesting choice of cherry, sponge cake, and custard. My girlfriend enjoyed the Berry Sensation (with ice cream). Oh, and I added ice cream to mine, also. For $2 per, ugh. I imagine the markup on ice cream scoops in restaurants is something around 1,000,000,000%.

Of course, we weren'tt going to need to be catered to extensively, since we just got desserts. But we even had to ask for water because they seemingly forgot to give us any.

If you're in the area and are looking for dessert and don't mind paying for it, give it a shot."}
{"text":"While small, this place packs quite a lot of charm.  It has a clean and comfy feel to it, with those big club chairs, white tablecloths and local art on the wall,  

They have a small brunch menu, with more choices for lunch.  Our table each chose something different to try - I had the Sea King (smoked salmon, wrapped in whole wheat wrap to look like sushi).  Not great but pretty god.  Someone had a savoury crepe with a Moroccan lamb stew and that was delicious.  We all tried different teas but the lychee rose and the champagne tea were my absolute favourites!  I would go back for those 2 teas alone!  

The service was nice and the staff really know their teas and can help you choose. The tea menu can be overwhelming.  They also have the typical dessert plate you can get if you want a more typical tea experience and not more of a food experience.

If you are looking for somewhere to take you mom for Mother's day this place would be a nice change from the typical hotel tea places.  It is small so definitely make a reservation"}
{"text":"We had the Chocolate-Lovers Afternoon Tea for Two:- A Groupon Voucher
Unremarkable. Scones were rock hard and cookie like. Sandwiches were boring, flavours mundane and uncreative, also why give an option to choose sandwiches, when you bring me whatever you want without asking me my preference? I can read the menu you handed me and it said to choose 4 of what was listed, yet you gave me no option and no reason why I was not given a choice... I found this to be a flaw in respecting your customer.
Dessert flavours were not well balanced and tasted like a block of dark chocolate without any differing notes, it served to overwhelm any other aspects of the sweet treats. 
I will say the chocolate croissant, Carbonated Jasmine tea, Rooibos Out Of Africa Wine Buds and coco-caramel buds tea was lovely, but not enough of an incentive for me to return to this establishment as I had come with high hopes for delicious scones.
I however see great potential in a quaint, lovely setting with a very creative room design. I honestly suggest having tea yourselves at the Omni King Edward, Windsor Arms Hotel or Ritz Carlton and getting an idea of what scones should be, for that was the most disappointing aspect of the entire experience, maybe some research will help you further develop your own recipe. 
I say if you're in the area by all means stop in and try the tea and perhaps other fare available on their menu, but sadly at this point an otherwise hopeful tea experience fell short of my expectations. I would sooner pay the extra $$$ for a tea experience with light, melt in your mouth scones, than hard cookies masquerading as scones.

Response to Owner - I have also had Scones in London, Tottenham, and three different regions of Isle of wight, your scones were nothing like what I encountered and sampled. But I am no expert and it indeed did not suit my taste in scones."}
{"text":"Not worth it at all !!! Arrived with mom, sister and 1 year old child and waited 40 minutes for food. Took 20 for the tea to come. They did a quality check after we were done everything . Although portions look small , they are filling . We got classic afternoon tea service , vegetable sharing plate and an omelette (mostly for child). At the end it also came with a fermented tea \"champagne \". Overall , food was not impressive and definitely not the 80$ we spent . Would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"It's a small place.  They have been overhwlemed with groupbuy vouchers.  If you have one, make sure you make a reservation.  

It used to be two levels but now it's just at the top.  It's quaint, like someone's upstairs room.  Service was good, at first we were the second table there but sure enough people started coming in.  

This review would have earned higher stars if (the server didn't mix up our teas, we didn't realize it until at the end).  

Next, they brought out the dessert crepe before we were finished.  Mine was all melted by the time I ate it.

Scones are nice 2 for $4 but really pricey.  You get some jam and mascarpone but man, does it have to be that small???"}
{"text":"AMAZING value for the price. I would highly recommend the brunch deals here. Each of the items includes a pot of tea, generally for a total of under $10.

I came with two of my girlfriends. I ordered the Fairlawn Favourite (crepe with smoked turkey, swiss cheese and a large omega-3 egg) with mango lemon fruit infusion tea. The other two both ordered Toast of Snowdon (spiced french toast served with fresh berries, mascarpone cream and maple syrup), with oolong vanilla tea and black cocoa caramel tea. I think the fruit tea was my favourite, as the flavours of the other two weren't as apparent. 

Service was ok - they forgot to give us any milk or sugar when our teas first came on. We then asked for sugar, and it didn't seem to occur to the waiter that he had forgotten milk as well. It was relatively empty throughout our stay, as it was a weekday afternoon. However, I would love to come back and try their desserts."}
{"text":"Went to T buds with dear friends for an early lunch on a Saturday.  You need reservation as the place is small and I saw them turn away customers as they were all booked for lunch. We had crepes, club sandwich and dessert crepes with wonderful teas. The atmosphere is kind of chic. The place is small but charming. On top of all that  the meat is halal. I can't wait to tell all my friends and family about this gem of a place."}
{"text":"Went for the savoury cream tea set with a pot of mango pineapple black tea.  Expected nicer presentation (normally you see a tower of scone/sandwich/fruits etc) but everything is served on one plate.  Server didn't offer me any honey to go with my tea :( Food portion was ok but tea was soso.  Will not go back for full price but using the 2 for $25 living social deal was worth the try."}
{"text":"Make it a point to go there whenever I am in Toronto. Right from the ambience to the food everything just comes up to the expectations. Their Thai Pagoda Crepes and London Broil sandwich are delicious. Don't forget the fresh Scones with cream and raspberry jam. They also have a wide array of teas. Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"An excellent place for afternoon tea, I am a fan. Even my husband, who's not a big fan of afternoon tea, was impressed a little...
The quiche, sandwiches, scones, macaroon, fresh fruits, desserts...everything was so yummy!!
I just wish that the scones were warmer, but everything else was excellent. 
I didn't know about a Groupon voucher, so next time I'll go using Groupon with my girlfriends."}
{"text":"Quite the cute little shoppe. 

My order: 
Savory Crepes: The Caesar (absolutely amazing), The lamb one (forgot the name-- wasn't too bad, a bit exotic), 
Dessert Crepes: SBC (yummy), Orchard custard (loved it!) 

Pros: 
- my servers were very gracious and friendly; 
In fact Frankie started conversation on multiple occasions and was quite easy to warm up to-- he mentioned a bit about tea drinking etiquette, he took the time to get to know myself & my friend. It was a very nice and heart warming ambiance 
- a wide selection of teas to choose from-- and sugars! (honey, sugar syrup, the list goes on)
- their crepes are absolutely delicious!
- it was a very nice quiet place; very easy to catch up with my friend. there weren't any loud noises in the background
- loved the furniture and set up of the place

Cons:
- not near a subway line
- subjected to DT parking/traffic (which is never fun) 

I went on a groupon which discounted the Crepe Experience for me. It was phenomenal; I will definitely be coming back here for their Afternoon tea experience!"}
{"text":"So disappointing. We had been wanting to do an afternoon tea experience for so long and this place seemed great when I found it online. As soon as we walked up the stairs there were no staff in sight. Some other ladies sitting down politely told us that a private party was coming in half an hour and we would have to leave. We thought that was fine. One of the servers came out and tried to get us to leave because they were planning an event (even though the restaurant was open for another 3 hours). She got the owner or manager who was very unpleasant and rude and tried to get us to leave. We weren't budging since we were tired and hungry and convinced her we would eat in half an hour. 

We got the savoury tea for $19 each. I almost laughed out loud when I saw how much food we actually got. The server said we could share but if we were \"really hungry\" we could get one each. You get 6 tiny little pieces of sandwiches, 2 small scones with jam and creme mascarpone and the smallest little cup of fruit. Why are you worried about us not finishing eating in a half hour with this little amount of food? It's not like you're paying for good service either. When we finally wanted to pay, no one was in sight. The server decided she needed to correct me when I asked for \"cream of earl gray\" INSTEAD of \"earl gray de la creme.\" My apologies. The tea was just okay, I've had better earl gray many times. I will note that the scones were delicious and the sandwiches were pretty good, but with everything else it's hard to enjoy.    

Bottom line: If you require reservations and decide to shut down your restaurant 3 hours early for a private party, you need to make this clear on your website or post a sign on the door. They have not updated the website - no longer do they have two levels, it is now just the upstairs. I certainly wouldn't bother with this place again, but if you wish - call ahead."}
{"text":"I adore this place, even though I've only visited this place once. If it wasn't for the fact that the location isn't that easily accessable by subway, as it is smack dab between Lawrence/Yonge station but closer to York Mills Station. I'd probably be making a LOT of excuses to come here. 

I showed up here on a lazy Sunday afternoon for lunch to try out their crepes and their tea. The store is two levels, with the lounge/kitchen upstairs and the cafe downstairs. 

The upstairs lounge is great casual space, and has big squishy armchairs and couches on one side and a table on the other.

Unfortunately, when we went the A/C was broken upstairs and the sound system was kind of annoying with the subwoofer acting up from time to time. They were willing to turn it off for us, when we asked.

So the crepes around 15.00, includes a small side salad and your choice of cuppa, which you can either get hot or cold.

Their crepes are simply wonderful, great texture with a touch of chewy, and sturdily thin. Our orders,  Spice Island crepe, which was stuffed with crab meat, and nicely spicy without being overwhelming. The boyfriend ordered the Moghul, which was butter chicken in a crepe (as he called it) and another mutual friend ordered the smoke Salmon crepe (I forget the actual name on the menu)

For dessert, we split the Irish Strawberry and their classic crepe. I'd said go straight for the classic; even though the Irish Strawberry was heavenly. But I loved the classic more, because it was so simply done,   lemon and sugar, and an A-plus follow up after our lunch crepes. 

All the crepes paired wonderfully well with the mix of teas we had ordered with our crepes. (the other mutual friend ordered the Oolong Milky Way, I ordered the Lychee Rose Iced, and the boyfriend ordered the chai) I, also, liked the fact that they split the crepes into 3 plates, without us having to ask. 

I spent a bit of time chatting with the owners, and they're very friendly and enthusiatic about the products that they carry. They did a tea tasting for me to taste the difference between some of the different types of oolong they had and how it would taste versus the Iron Goddess they had on hand. 

The store, also, does tea tasting seminars and if it as fun as the impromtu tea tasting seminar I had, I'll probably drag a few friends for a tea seminar and afternoon tea. 

The store, also, offers the afternoon tea for 4 people, which retails around $48 before taxes. They recommend you call ahead for afternoon tea, at least a day in advance, although they did tell me that if you call in the morning of the day you want to go, they should be able to accomodate you. 

They accept all major credit cards and debit."}
{"text":"Second floor is not easy find and the space for afternoon tea too compact. The chair are so comfortable"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place, but never ventured into T-buds until Janna organized a UYE here (thanks Janna!). It's a bit of a trek for downtowners, but actually pretty close to Lawrence station so I could see myself coming back here if I'm in the 'hood. 

We sat upstairs and somehow were there for 3 hours, which flew by because the atmosphere was so comfy and relaxed. The service is great and we never felt rushed to leave. Our server made sure we had more hot water for the tea pots as time went on. 

I had a creamy earl gray latte which was fragrant and smooth, and did not require any sugar as there was a hint of sweetness in the tea already. I did not go for one of the afternoon tea sets, but they looked lovely on the three-tiered stands. I would be back to try that for sure! Instead, I had a lemon-y kale and quinoa salad (very reasonably priced, around $5 for a small) which was fresh and tasty. They have an impressive variety of sweet and savoury crepes, sandwiches, and salads in addition to the more typical scones and petit fours. The tea menu is vast and somewhat overwhelming, encouraging multiple visits! They all sounded so good..."}
{"text":"Loving the afternoon tea!! Came here with the hub and we ordered one Afternoon Tea Service, a smoothie, and a Vanilla Bomb (vanilla ice-cream and strawberries crepe). Everything was delicious and the chairs were very comfy, making the whole experience enjoyable and relaxing. Their little sandwiches are so incredibly yummy, the cream cheese and cucumber just melts in your mouth!
Seeing other yelpers' pictures made me realize that T-Buds only has the top floor now, as a new Aroma will be opening up in the corner."}
{"text":"I got one of those coupon deals for this place. My previous experiences with high tea was only King Edward Hotel so I can't really compare the two places.

For the coupon, I get one pot of tea, an assortment of sandwiches and cookies for two people and a box with an assortment of different teas.

The sandwiches and cookies were good but not spectacular. The service was a bit slow.

I think that I got a great deal with the coupon but I wouldn't come here without any special deal because I find their afternoon tea a bit pricey."}
{"text":"We came here after dinner, as we were looking for something sweet. After briefly looking up places nearby, we discovered they have crêpes - sold!

The only other people here when we arrived, was a group of women and their children for a birthday party. They seemed to be wrapping up, so we didn't assume there would be an issue with service. 

It took us a while to be greeted, and we were eventually sat at a table that hadn't been cleaned. The chairs and table had loads of crumbs and other sticky messes. I had to clean it off myself, as the employee who greeted us disappeared. I waited a few minutes before taking my napkin and wiping them off. I didn't particularly want to use the same napkin that I used to wipe the table and seats, so I ended up taking one from another table to use. 

We sat at the table for at least 15 minutes before someone finally came to take our order. The initial 10 minutes allotted us time to peruse the limited menu, but the time thereafter was a bit annoying. We kept staring at where the doorway employees disappeared to, and eventually they realized we wanted something from them. 

We finally ordered our crêpes, but we never received water. We kept thinking they would drop some off every time they flitted in and out of the really small dining space. Eventually we got our crêpes and asked for water then. But they didn't bring any until we were nearly done with our crêpes. They also never checked on us. I get that there was only two of them, but surely one of them could have manned the dining room, while the other did whatever it was they were doing in the back room. 

Even after the party left, we were still getting terrible service. We could have easily dined and dashed with how little attention they were paying to us. For the amount of waiting we had to do for crêpes, it should have been the best crêpes I've ever had. Which they were not.

I got the Berry Sensation with vanilla ice cream, and my fiancé got the Cherry Trifle. They were mediocre at best, and coupled with the terrible service, I'm tempted to give T-Buds a 1. But the food was better than a 1, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they're not usually so slow or inattentive. For what you get, I found it to be pricey.

Overall: 2/5
Food: 3/5
Service: 1/5
Atmosphere: 1/5"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the OOlong milky way tea served here; there's nothing quite like it anywhere else I've been. The selection here is impressive and the staff seems to know what they are talking about. Food on the menu is simple but well prepared and the ambiance is charming.  This is a great place to meet with friends and chat for hours...I know because I've taken that idea for a test run and it works!  

On a completely practical note, There is a bathroom located in the basement AND the second floor. If you're drinking tea for a few hours that might be useful information for you. Just sayin."}
{"text":"My daughter treated me to tea-- perfect excuse the take the afternoon off. Our server, Justin was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. 

My Earl grey was perfection, heady with bergamot, just the way I love it. The finger sandwiches each had something different and original about them. All were delicious. One was dusted with smoked Hungarian paprika for a kick. The petite fours were exquisite. 

The owner came over to greet us when we were almost done, and she was very sweet and gracious. My daughter agreed with my assessment of the earl grey and purchased a tin to take home. 

The only thing that I'd change is the paper napkins for linen ones. 

We had a wonderful experience and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I originally went here last summer with my sister as we had a deal from one of those websites. We went for savoury cream tea which included a pot of tea, biscuits with jam and creme fresh, and six little sandwiches. It's a great amount for the price.Even without the deal, it's only $16. We sat upstairs the first time and the atmosphere is so comfy and relaxing. It's easy to spend a few hours here. As part of the deal, we were sent home with extra tea and travel mugs. 
The second time we went was for my sister's birthday. She had received a deal from them...come to think of it, I'm pretty sure I signed up too but didn't get anything for my birthday :(. Oh well. We sat at the lower level the second time, which is just as comfy as upstairs, it's just not as private. We also ordered a crepe which was delicious.
We plan to go back and bring our mom. It's a great location too."}
{"text":"I am a holistic nutritionist, so it matters to me what I put into my body. I had seen this place near work and checked out the menu which was full of \"unholistic\" things like white flour crepes, scones, desserts and sandwiches with processed meats etc... 

HOWEVER, I thought well let me check it out anyway and let me tell you I was so glad I did! I had a wonderful organic lentil salad with the Milky Way Oolong tea. It was so fresh and healthy and the tea was AMAZING. The other day I had the Moroccan lentil soup and Moroccan spice red & white beet with sweet potato salad. Every bite was heaven. I was beaming as I told clients for the day how good my lunch was :)

I loved it all so much I had to tell the chef, who after talking to him, he told me he was a Holistic Wellness Chef. Once I heard that I knew for sure he cared what I put into my body just as much as I do! 

I am a regular at T-Buds. I love it. I don't eat anything outside of the fresh made salads by the Wellness Chef and I try different teas.. but I can tell you without a doubt your digestive system will love you if you eat the freshly made soups and salads. They are so healthy and good for you :)

As for the teas, they are all very good and not filled with fillers and artificial flavouring. You are allowed to see them through clear jars and actually go up and open and sniff the teas for yourself unlike another very popular Tea Shop that has a wall full of solid coloured plastic containers and you can't see what's in them, and you have to ask someone to get the tea for you to smell it. 

The staff is very friendly and the Chef is amazing. They make sure your experience at T-Buds is a good one and that you leave there happy.

It's a nice kind of.. spa meets lounge feel, with lots of windows and cool chill out electronica music. 

I like T-Buds if you haven't notice yet :oP.  

Only thing I can say as a critique is that the service can be kind of slow at times if they're busy as they only have one wait staff person working. 

I cant speak to their regular menu or tea time because I don't really eat that stuff :/

But I am hoping that they'll have more holistic food choices on their tea party menus. I'm sure with the coming of the Holistic Wellness Chef that will change in the near future."}
{"text":"The 3 tiered snacks were very well prepared! All of the tea tasted great too! Servers were very friendly and attentive.

My only complaints - this place is small and the tables are so close together. I could hear all of the conversation the two girls were having next to us. Also the prices are a bit high for just afternoon tea."}
{"text":"Afternoon tea here was not bad for its price (was $25, now $27).  Includes a quiche, three finger sandwiches, scones, fruits and some petit fors (small cakes), and of course your choice of tea.  There are two floors, the restaurant feels clean and intimate.  There weren't many customers when we visited, so it was an overall a relaxing experience."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the high tea. Luckily we got a Groupon to experience t-buds and we were not disappointed! $32 for $64 experience for two.

Served a pot of tea - the sencha passion green tea was delicious! Must drink. 

First course was a crepe (cheese and spinach) with a summer salad (the dressing was so good! I think it was mango and tangerine... Or something along those lines).

Then they gave us the 3 tier plate with small sandwiches, scones, and dessert. Everything was amazing! Wasn't a huge fan of the desserts but they were decent enough. The scones were buttery and light. Mini sandwiches were delicious! 

The place itself is beautiful with natural light coming through. Comfy chairs to sit at. The service was great! Good job ladies. 

I would definitely come back for this experience. A great way to spend afternoon tea with your girlfriend :) it is a bit pricey so if you get a chance to experience it with a coupon or discount, DO IT!"}
{"text":"Got the groupon for $45 for high tea for two which according to groupon the regular price was $72. I wasn't sure what the difference between high tea and the $29 per person afternoon tea but overall it's still a good deal. I chose the puerh cocoa caramel black tea. It was very delicious with milk and sugar. My mom chose the mango pineapple black tea which was very fruity. The scones were definitely the highlight. Atmosphere is excellent. There were only 2 other table on a Friday afternoon 5pm. I would definitely come back again. Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday around 4pm for afternoon tea.  Bought the Groupon deal for $28 for a classic afternoon tea for two which is regular price for $58.  What a great deal!  The decor was very warm and the staff were all very friendly.  The place was small seating about 26 people so its better to make reservations.  The place was pretty full when we arrive and by about 4:30pm, the place was full.

The classic afternoon tea for two included two pots of tea with 2 warm quiches to start, follow by a three tiered tray that had a wide variety of fancy tea sandwiches, 2 raisin scones, 2 plain scones, 2 macarons , 2 mini sweets and 2 mini fresh fruits dishes.  The sandwiches were very tasty with interesting flavours like paprika and curry.  My favourite was the warm raisin scone especially with the Mascarpone cream and jam that was served with it.  As for the tea selection, there was probably over 40 teas to choose from.  I had the green passion fruit tea which was light and fruity - very nice!  To our surprise, the meal finished off with a flute of sparkling green tea which was very refreshing.  We also ordered the Caesar chicken crepe for our daughter which was delicious.  If you love savoury crepes, then you must come try it here!

We will definitely come back.  Probably won't be ordering the classic afternoon tea next time as there was a bit too much food.  The savoury cream afternoon tea at $38 for two would be a better option for us as it has the same three tiered tray of sandwiches, scones and fruits and a pot of tea each which is more than enough food for us."}
{"text":"I had chocolate inspired afternoon tea set with groupon. Great value!  

T-buds has a large selection of tea. I tried dark chocolate mint buds and coco caramel buds.  They both were recommended with the chocolate inspired tea set. Both tea were very good and I ended buying two tins to take home. :)

Tea sandwiches are good, but nothing too special. I was fooled by the crepe thinking it's sweet, but it's actually savory with a little spicy kick.  We got two types of scones, chocolate and cranberry. Both were fresh baked and fluffy.  All the desserts are good as well."}
{"text":"I walked past this place for months without going in because I didn't know that they served hot food.  Little did I know.  The crepes are delightful!  Try the great ceasar with roast chicken, garlic dressing, caramelized onions, portobello mushrooms and parmesan cheese!  Yummy!  I accompanied my meal with a simple unsweetened green tea latte.  I have to try the afternoon tea next."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for summer afternoon tea and I have to say I was impressed. Right off the bat the atmosphere is great, super clean, fancy looking little place. The walls are lined with different teas and the seating and tables are lovely. My friend and I picked our teas and everything else was taken care of. We started with a salad and cheese filled crepe which was pretty good, I wasn't a huge fan of the mango dressing. Next we had the usual high tea platers. We were given an assortment of sandwiches (tuna, egg, butter chicken, beet), small bowl of fruit each, blueberry and plain scones (which were warm) served with clotted cream and jam, and lastly an assortment of small desserts. Overall everything tasted really good, I'm a huge fan of scones and these with amazing. The only complaint would be the tiny dessert they didn't really fit in with the rest of the platter and again there was these weird mango tasting pudding that I wasn't a fan of. In the end I had a great experience and my friend and I even purchased a tin of tea each to take home."}
{"text":"A certain yelper sent me to The Uptown Tea Lounge which was just opened for less than 2 weeks prior to my visit... Everything here is clean and fresh...and the staffs are super nice. 

Tea selections wise is decent... most of the teas are priced from $5 to $15 for 50 gram. The nice thing about The Uptown Tea Lounge is they are selling sample scoop package so you can just have a taste and those are great for stocking stuffers for your tea loving friends! (someone reading this?) 

For staying in to enjoy a pot of tea... they are starting from $5 per pot... served brewing in one of those Teaze tea infuser- made with medical grade Eastman Trita. 

The good thing is of course you can smell every single type of tea before you order! :) I like the detail descriptions of all the tea in their menu so great if you are a tea novice. The staffs here are really friendly too and trying to give you some suggestions. 

I ordered Oolong Milky Way ($6) to stay 
- \"A unique Oolong from China with high \"sweet milk\" notes mingling with impeccable orchid hints to create a long smooth lingering finish. A milk lovers delight!\" 
- It is really intriguing and different to experience Oolong tea with this heavy body and hint of milky taste... finish is quite silky and smooth 

I got a sample scoop of Black Tea. Lychee Rose buds ($2.50) to go 
- \"A deliciously sweet tea smooth and cooling with the floral hint of rose to create a refreshing brew and the sweetness of lychees to awaken your taste!\" 
- Remind me of summer and lychee jello.... fruity and strong... 

The Upper Tea Lounge also serves Afternoon Tea $26 for 2 which is quite reasonable. And for sandwiches and wraps with $2 extra you get a pot of tea with tea matching too. 

OH and Crepes... Crepes.. I have to be back for their Crepes!!"}
{"text":"An amazing experience in terms of atmosphere, people and food.. from the moment you step in you are welcome by the colour the décor and the people of the place. I thought I knew about tea but this place has proved me wrong there. There are so many different kinds of tea on the shelves which you can pick up and smell and even try out if you want. 
That was about the tea, the sweet and savoury crepes are like taste bud drugs. They are amazing. Starting from the portion, the price and the quality, I haven't have any healthier and yummier crepe than here. The crepes come with a salad on the side and a tea. I also had visited their second floor which is like a lounge for afternoon tea  called high tea. The lounge is spectacular. The furniture is very very comfortable with warm lighting. There is also facilities of projector it seemed for business meetings and other events.
So over all this place was an complete experience in terms of food, service and quality. I would definitely recommend it to any one."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and always had a great experience, whether sitting down with a friend or just picking up some tea leaves to take home. The selection of tea is excellent, and the servers are knowledgeable, especially the owner, who is often working there. The crepes and other desserts are delicious. I also appreciate the generous hours, as I usually like to go in the evening"}
{"text":"Went for high tea with a friend using a Groupon deal. The deal was really worth it for high tea in Toronto, including a soup and savoury crepe as well. It was a $32 deal for 2 which is a really good deal compared to other high tea places. It is more of a modern version of high tea; the space is small but cozy and is located upstairs. In terms of ambience, I would say that the downtown hotel high tea places are nicer, but this place has a modern feel. The pumpkin soup was delicious, crepe was ok though. The selection of teas was excellent and I enjoyed a green tea with apple and pear tastes. The sandwiches were all tasty, scones were done just right with clotted cream and jam, and the desserts were cute. The portions for high tea were average but it was nice to have a crepe and soup was a nice touch. I enjoyed the teas a lot. I would recommend this place for the price point and tea selection."}
