{"text":"A former Pizza Hut turned into the Grand Pearl which has been rebranded as Great Taste Chinese Cuisine. Even with these transformations, the quality of food has unfortunately remained about the same across the three establishments.   It's a bustling place that's filled with almost solely Asian clientele. Make sure you have a reservation or you'll be waiting by the fish tank, wondering if the fishes are sushi grade, even on a weekday.   The food is well, simply... average. The poached chicken is okay. The Asian greens are okay (dau miu, gai lan, etc). The only dish that stood out was a perfectly acceptable crispy shrimp dish with salted egg yolks known as Golden Sand Prawns. They do have dim sum items available at dinner but the xiao long bao (soup dumplings) or green onion pancakes were pretty disappointing. Even with their ties to Great Taste in Chinatown, I'd pass on the dim sum items, unless gummy, doughy, flavourless things are your jam. But probably not. Unfortunately, the Peking Duck also gets a hard pass as the wraps and the duck itself were just too dry.   Service? Non-existent. But isn't that part of the charm of these authentic Chinese restaurants? They are almost friendly enough but I would describe the service here as curt or more kindly, efficient. The teapot is refilled, water replenished, dishes corrected... as long as you're able to flag someone down.   2.5 stars bumped up as they will give you the usual complimentary dessert soup. Who can turn down soup? And free?  Not sure the prawns alone are enough to draw me back... even if they are covered in gold."}
{"text":"We had our Easter lunch here which we just accidentally found. There weren't a lot of people when we arrived which was lucky but it became packed so fast as lunch time approached. The restuarant serves dimsum. Enough choices that won't confuse our overwhelm you. The food taste good. Service is okay but when it got crowded,  I think they did not have enough servers and space to accommodate the number of people coming in.  We were lucky we came early.  Will come back here again cause the husband enjoyed it."}
{"text":"2nd location in Central North Calgary, very good dim sum place. Very busy place, opens @ 9:30 am, usually there is a line up by 10:30 am if no reservation. Clean, reasonable price, good service but not enough servers for the weekend. Recommend to try dim sum & dinner."}
{"text":"Best XLB in Calgary!   Every Dim Sum dish is great! If in the NE go here for Dim Sum.   Black Sesame Ball are very tasty"}
{"text":"Review: dinner.  This place was recommended to us by a fellow Asian and I'm always looking for the best authentic Chinese food in town so we had to give the restaurant a shot.  Bottomline: typical authentic Chinese cuisine with big portions. Not the friendliest or cleanest place out there.  Atmosphere: you know it's an authentic Chinese restaurant when it can be summed up by these 8 words: Busy. Loud. Understaffed. Rude. Cramped. Hairball under table.  Food: everything we ordered was pretty good, albeit over-seasoned (possibly due to copious MSG?). Flavors stayed true to the cuisine.  Value: fairly good considering the portions you are getting. Just make sure you bring Goku, or that friend who can eat up a storm, with you."}
{"text":"Authentic is how i'd describe Great Taste Chinese Cuisine. Expect it to be jammed packed during dinner service. Waiters running back n forth with deep buckets busing tables that's literally at elbow's reach to the next table. Patrons impatiently waiting at the door; hoping their number to be called next. And, I will agree with them. It is worth the wait. One dish i'd highly recommend ordering is their golden fried fish. Batter is mixed with a duck egg to give a salty, briny taste that just coats your mouth. Dinner also comes with a nice desert du jour. Just remember to call ahead of time to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Dim Sum, great service, great food, English-speaking staff and free parking - what more can you ask?  Had their dim sum on a Monday and it was fairly busy at the restaurant at about 11:30 a.m.  Good selection of dim sum items that you can pick and choose off a list which has both English and Chinese menu items.  We ordered the  - Xiu Long Pau - Shanghai Steamed Dumplings with black vinegar and ginger sauce - Delicious and piping hot! - Beijing Dumplings - I think it's pork with leek.  Delicious nonetheless, also served with black vienegar and ginger sauce. - Har kow - Steamed Shrimp Dumplings - Very good. - Steamed Chicken Feet - Delicious. - Wu Kok - Taro with pork and deep-fried with that lovely crust.  I love it!! - Pan Fried Fish Cake - yummy! - Sticky Rice - delish! - Chef Special Congee - interesting with julienned intestines, roasted peanuts, ginger, shrimp, pork - Great! - Yow Tiu - Great with the Congee! - Char Siew Soh - Baked BBQ Pork Pie - very good.  Service was exceptional.    Have to try their dinner now... Will be back!"}
