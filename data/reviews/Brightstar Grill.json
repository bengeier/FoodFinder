{"text":"Great atmosphere and service is really fast The burgers are the best around. The fries are great. On the weekends the place is really crowded with nice hometown folks. The customers are real friendly, not arrogant or Butts like you see at some of the other restaurants   Highly recommend this place if you want a good burger, hot dog BBQ fried chicken  fries or such"}
{"text":"If you are from Mount Holly then you know how good it is. If you are passing through and want a throw back to the old days and good food you should stop here and give it a try. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We were in Mount Holly doing some Christmas shopping and used Yelp to find lunch. Thanks to all of the great reviews we have found a little gem! The food is simple, no frills, basic drive in fare, but everything was so fresh. They were pretty busy, so food took a little time to come out. It was worth it, though. A great place to take the family."}
{"text":"Food is okay but tables are always dirty. Sometimes they act like they don't want to take your order.."}
{"text":"Fun family atmosphere. The best burger around.  Everyone should try the lotta burger."}
{"text":"Great Food!

You have to love the lota burger for sure.. but the bbq sandwich is killer, and a better salad bar than alot of larger places.."}
{"text":"went there with my fiance and the food was not at all what i expected from the reviews.
we got two hamburgers and an order of chili cheese fries. 
the bun was deflated and soggy. the burger meat itself looked promising but was burnt and vastly overcooked.. 

SAVE your money on the chili cheese fries. at $3.99, you get maybe two handfuls of their fries with two small spoons of unidentifiable meat (pork? beef?!) and cheese sauce that you get for your nachos at the gas station. 

they do have their own radio station with great music, and fun books to read while you wait. regrettably the food was just not what we were expecting, and it is such a shame."}
{"text":"Great BBQ plate, amazing slaw on burger. So glad I found this place right near my house."}
{"text":"Why haven't I been here before now?  I live relatively close but unless you have heard of this place you probably wouldn't know it exists. It's tucked away in a neighborhood but its well worth the trip. It's like stepping back in time when drive-ins were all the hype only no one comes out; you go in.  The burgers are tasty, juicy and had all the toppings I like.  Its nothing fancy but the food and music make me want to return ... and I will!"}
{"text":"Keep your money .after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a try sorry I did.. The pickles and onion rings were so greasy and the sandwich was soggy the only thing I had good was my drink... Sorry"}
{"text":"Living near the  Brightstar, convenience brings us in more than anything.  My favorite is the salad bar, which is small, but always fresh, and seems to have all my favorite ingredients.  A+ on the salad.  Lunch includes pizza buffet with the salad bar, but they rarely have more than one or two choices of cold, bland pizza.  We recently had a philly which was on special for lunch, and the flavor was great, but the sandwich was    very small.  My wife, who is not a big eater, was still hungry when we left.  This place has a lot of untapped potential when it comes to the food.   The staff is friendly, but there is very little table service.  This place is OK for convenience, since Mount Holly has little to offer food-wise, but don't go out of your way to get here."}
{"text":"I ordered a Texas Chicken Sandwich and recieved two pieces of bread with massive slices of tomato. The tomato was thicker than the chicken was. It was disappointing. The hush puppies however were amazing. Unfortunately all the food is very greasy."}
{"text":"This is a Flashback of the 1960's Drive-in Restaurant. The double bacon cheeseburger is the bomb! Who woulda thought bacon, slaw and tomato would taste so good on a cheeseburger? It literally dances in your mouth, sweet and salty! I recommend you try that cheeseburger, you won't be disappointed. Although, there have been some hit and miss visits, not always consistent. They need to advertise more. Not a lot of people know about it."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Went there for a lunch meeting and we both enjoyed what we got! Thank you to the owners!"}
{"text":"Thought it was a joke when I arrived at the Maps address, but drove in the driveway anyway.  Nice surprise!  Lottaburger plate with Tots, slaw on the burger, and a pepper on the side with drink $8.  Oldies (60s-80s?) radio station.  Free WiFi (ask for the password).  Friendly lady at the counter."}
{"text":"Not good, not bad but nothing special. Bright star has been here quite some time. We went around 3 on a Friday and it wasn't very busy. 

While walking up to order, we walked passed the salad bar and it looked extremely unappealing. We all just got burgers and sides. You could tell the tater tots and fries came straight out of the bag. The potato wedges seem like the best choice of the bunch.

I just got a double cheeseburger with lettuce and onions. It was okay again, nothing special. The total for a double cheeseburger and potato wedges was eight bucks, which is a pretty good deal, but like I said, the food was just average."}
{"text":"My family is considering moving to Mount Holly and decided to explore the area for restaurants. Siri lead us here. At first I was leery, but some of the best rats aren't in fancy restaurants. My husband ordered fried pickles and they were delicious. I had the barbecue sandwich while my daughter had a burger and onion rings. The wait staff was pleasant and the food was good. I can see this place being a family weekend stop."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place as a kid. Not sure if my taste buds have matured with age, or if the quality has plummeted, but I don't think I'll be back. I ordered a cheeseburger all the way, Mom had the same but on Texas toast. I picked my burger up and the whole bottom bun was soggy from the (sweet) coleslaw juice. So not only had our food sat long enough for my bottom bun to absorb the coleslaw juice before arriving at the table, my mom pulled a hair out from her burger, no, not her hair. The sucker was wedged between the two slices of Texas toast. So I wI really wanted to enjoy a nostalgic meal at one of the only living Mt Holly originals. Oh, well."}
{"text":"Very good burgers and tater tots. Highly recommend! We also enjoyed the DJ booth playing the radio station."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever hearing about this restaurant  so I had to try it out. I have to say that it was definitely a great decision. I got a bacon double cheese and it was huge and so full of flavor. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to all of my friends and anyone else who loves burgers."}
{"text":"A trip back in time. I'm not from this area but my wife is and she says this was the spot when she was a teen. Nothing fancy but good food and if your lucky a regular in a sharp old car will be there and willing to tell some tales."}
{"text":"By far the best burgers in Mount Holly!   Cowboy pickles (dill) and Cowgirl pickles (sweet) are awesome.   The renovation has added plenty of room.   Try the grilled pimento cheese sandwich also, out of this world!"}
{"text":"It's like Happy Days, without Richie and The Fonz. Great burgers, great fries, and diet sundrop on tap. No place else like it. Oh, and a radio station broadcasting 50's and 60's hits from the diner too. If you're lucky, they'll play a request for you. Love this place when i'm in Mt. Holly or Belmont."}
{"text":"Salad bar was simple but delicious. The lotta burger was a must try! The salad bar also came with fresh pizza. Super nice staff and nostalgic feel made this a great treat after our mega jump!"}
{"text":"When you just want a good old fashion cheeseburger, you have to go with the LottaBurger from Brightstar, nothing fancy, but a great burger.  Reminescent of soda shoppes and grills of years past.  Just about the same price as a combo at Wendy's or McDonald's, but so much better."}
{"text":"Great place to get a real burger, but a bit pricey. The operating hours are great, too."}
{"text":"We were very hungry and had just spent the day at the US National Whitewater Center nearby.  Didn't really know what to expect from this old Drive In Restaurant.  It looked old inside but what do you expect from an older drive in.  That's where the old stopped.  Food was great.  My son and I ate the LottaBurger with Cheese and all the toppings.  It was delicious.  Meat was nicely seasoned and the cole slaw on the burger added a different taste.  My wife had a barbecue sandwich which she also enjoyed.  Onion rings were very good. If you've had a long day out at the Whitewater Center this is the perfect place to end it."}
{"text":"If you crave a little nostalgia, Brightstar Drive-In is a throwback to a simpler, more neighborly time. 

The menu is pretty simple: The LottaBurger that made them famous, pizza, onion rings, tater tots and the like.

What I love about Brightstar, though, is the escape it provides from chain restaurants and Charlotte's \"Fisher Price\" design. Tucked in a quiet wooded lot in Mt. Holly, the place reminds me of burger joints I visited near my grandparents' camp in New York's southern tier as a kid.

Grab a deck of cards, a few friends, and head out to Brightstar for an evening. It's not too far from the Belmont Drive-In Theatre, so you could make a true throw-back experience out of it."}
{"text":"Burger was great! Fresh meat and great bun. Fries and onion rings were average. Ice cream was a bonus for my kid. Would definitely come back for a burger again!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! I have only had there food 3 times but everytime was very good. No complaints on the taste. Only reason it got 4 not 5 stars is because they are a little stengy with the fries a whole order is not a lot. Other than that the food is well worth the money."}
{"text":"I've lived in Mount Holly all my life yet have not eaten here until recently.  Have had a couple of their Double Bacon Cheeseburgers.  Incredible.   Their homemade BBQ slaw was also excellent.  Their burgers are gigantic and the cost is like $6.99 for the biggest ones.  Well worth it.   Plus, as an added bonus, you might get to see me there when you visit!  P.S.  They have a cherry lemon Sundrop with real cherries and lemons!"}
{"text":"This is a treasure from the past!  From the moment you drive up to the original drive-in and come into it's checker board floored dining room you are transported back to a time when food wasn't just processed and slapped onto a plate.  We ordered different versions of the burgers and fries and were treated to a taste from the past.  The fresh meat burgers (never frozen) were seared on a red hot flat-top until they were crispy around the edges and juicy in the middles.  Homemade slaw and chili covered my masterpiece, and the 1st bite sent me straight back into the days when life was simpler and food was awesome.  I can't say enough about this place, but will add that the hand scooped Mooresville ice cream and in-house \"rock n' roll\" radio station were the icing on the cake.  Can't wait t go back."}
{"text":"As we pulled up I was a tad concerned since the sign looks like it might be shut down.

I was mistake, this place is great for the amount of money you pay. Good food and food portions for under $10 with a drink. 

I went the chicken tenders with spicy BBQ and it came with hush puppies and two sides. Texas Toast already included.

I'll be back when I'm in Mt. Holly for work again."}
{"text":"What can I say more about this place. It's a truly hidden gem! The burgers are spot on and truly cooked to order.  The real speciality here is the amazing milkshakes though: Red Velvet or Salted Caramel highly recommended! Bonus: They're hand scooped right in front of you!

The fries are average, everything else a nice throwback to 'burger drive-ins'. Even the setting of the building  and a nice fresh salad bar thrown in the mix and you can't go wrong for lunch or a shake. Try the milkshakes!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here as we were passing through on our way home from Florida. A pleasant stop.  Nothing fancy but good food. We shared a Lottaburger and onion rings. Plenty of food to share and the prices were very reasonable. Burger was excellent and delicious cole slaw was a great topping."}
{"text":"When my Lotta Burger arrived, I had to stare at it for a couple of minutes to figure out a strategy for getting it my mouth. The burger patty plus slaw and tomato and pickles and cheese overlap the toasted oblong bun by an inch on either side. Finally figured out that there's just no way to be tidy eating this thing. Stuff will fall off into the styrofoam plate. Multiple napkins will be needed. It was great! I was also happy with the tater tots. But next time I will choose the salad bar on the side. It's not a great salad bar given that iceberg lettuce is the only lettuce but there's strawberries and mandarin oranges for those who would like a healthier side. 
The place has great old-drive-in atmosphere. They need better ice tea and better signage. When you turn in, go right."}
{"text":"The location and exterior make one hesitant to give it a try.  But, give it a try!  The burgers are EXCELLENT!  I get the double cheeseburger with L,T, extra onion, mustard & ketchup.  The salad bar is a great value.  I need to experience more items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a very sweet little hidden restaurant. It used to be a drive in but that's from days gone by. They have a little radio station booth inside from when they had their own station piping out to their customers.
 
The BBQ plate is very good and they have a nice little salad bar, which can be pretty hard to find these days. Lots of locals and friends meet up here to enjoy the food while they hang at their tables and talk.
 
The cheeseburgers are tasty. The hotdog deal can't be beat. Save a little room for ice cream once you're done. :-)"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the most hole-in-the-wallest places I've ever been. What makes it so cool is that in the era of mom and pop shops packing up, this place has been here for decades! There's even a poster on the wall of when Elvis died yall!! And they have an actual radio station on location playing all the hits! They get 2 stars just for ambiance and general bad-assedness! Two words...DRIVE IN!

The menu is very \"diner\". I got a blt and cowboy fried pickles. They also have cowgirl fried pickles. The difference you ask? Cowboy=Dill and Cowgirl=Sweet. Served with a side of rance, it was fabulous!! One of my friends got the salad bar which he liked. It's basic, but a great offering, none the less. 

When you come across a place like this and you see lots of senior citizens there at lunchtime, you can't help but know that it's been around for a very long time, has great food, a great story and you should try it too. Glad we stumbled across it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic southern style hamburger ... the Brightstar Lotta burger is your choice.  My husband and I share this since it's actually two hamburgers...bathed in slaw, mustard, onions, tomato and pickles.  They have excellent choices for sides, but I have to say the tater tots are perfect little fat bombs that I simply can't resist .  Such a cute little restaurant too...was a drive in joint that had a broadcast room for a DJ back in the day.  Picnic tables outside in case you pick one of these beautiful NC days to dine there.  Go for the experience and keep going back for the food"}
{"text":"Lotta burger is the reason to come (and come back again and again). Don't worry about your diet or calories and get you a lotta burger with some awesome tots and a Sun Drop from the fountain. This is what life is all about."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite,from that old school feeling when you pull in to the most AMAZING food and no matter if they work there or just customers everyone always greets each other with smile and kind word,truly a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"It's a great place to meet with family. Nothing fancy, nothing pricey. Just plain, honest burgers made to order and fresh. Sometimes it's that old, reliable quality that you need in your life, and the old grill is just the place for you."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for helping me find this place when I was nearby and craving a good burger. As you can see from my previous reviews, I specialize in frequenting these types of establishments and consider myself an expert in 'dive class' burgers. The Bright Star delivered. Burger had a great flavor that comes from the flat top, perfectly cooked, well seasoned, bun was toasted and juicy. Chili and slaw had great flavor. Service was pleasant and order was delivered to us while we sat outside at the picnic tables. This is a nostalgic piece of Americana that is disappearing and being replaced by generic, trendy and overpriced locales with craft beer."}
{"text":"The 7 and 8 year old grandchildren loooove this place. Simple 1950's diner atmosphere with great burgers, kids meals, barbeque sandwich or plate. The kids love the ice cream freezer where they can pick their dessert. It is not health food but it is super fun and the people are friendly. Old fashioned simplicity. Try it!"}
{"text":"Great burgers ! This place is a blast from the past ! Service was quick and friendly. The hamburger meat was obviously fresh and not frozen. They have a radio station inside the resturant and a very cool retro atmosphere !"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much from the road.  We hesitated going there for over a year, but we kept hearing great things about it, so we tried it last night.

The inside is great and very friendly, as opposed to the exterior.  They even have their own radio station, where they play great music.  They also had toys to keep my son busy while we waited for our food.  I had the Lotta Burger with onion rings.  The burger was one of the best I have ever had and the onion rings were awesome!  My wife had the shrimp plate with broccoli & cheese and mac&cheese.  The shrimp were good, but the sides weren't something either of us would recommend.

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is certainly a good place for a burger and fries and is definitely our go-to in Mount Holly for that purpose. You can call ahead or even order online and pick up at the drive thru. I don't remember it being as expensive as it seems to be now. We have an old menu from a few years ago and that may have thrown me off. I'd say a burger, side and drink is going to run about $10-12. We usually run over and pick up lunch for three of us in the office and it was $35 last time. Nonetheless, it's pretty good and easy to pick up a call-ahead. Those are both wins for us at lunch time!"}
{"text":"Brightstar is the classic drive-in burger joint. No frills (unless you count the radio station and chess/checkers board) but decent service and fantastic food! You gotta get the lotta burger!! It almost appears closed at first glance, but pull in and head inside and give them a chance! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great old school diner. I have been a few times and always stick with burger and tots or onion rings. Good prices, great food."}
{"text":"Very good burgers,wife had the BLT and loved it.Nice simple little place."}
{"text":"We called for a closing time.  They stated 9pm.  We arrived approximately 8:20pm to see a run-down diner with tacky paint.  

Upon approaching the cash register, we started to place an order for a pizza, about 1/4 of their menu on the wall.  We were told the pizza and salad bar were shut down at 8pm.

We ordered some chicken wings and chili cheese fries, as well as a burger.

The wings and cheese fries were disgusting.  The burger was edible.

After about 8 bites, we walked out still hungry and went elsewhere to eat."}
