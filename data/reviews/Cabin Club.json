{"text":"The steak was one of the best I've had in Cleveland. The sides were tasty and the cornbread side was just awesome. Unfortunately due to the mediocre service, I have to give Cabin Club a three. Our server was slow and could not get her timing right. We had a very long wait between getting drinks and our order being taken followed by another long wait before salads and soups were brought to the table. Our table of four had 2 soups and two salads. First one soup appeared. Minutes later the salads and a few minutes after that the final soup (the lobster bisque is outstanding!) It would have been better had all the soups and salads appeared together. Our steaks did show up together, however once done, there was another long wait for a dessert menu, more time spent waiting for her to take dessert orders, etc. To be fair, our server was friendly, just seemed disorganized. The atmosphere was more bar than steakhouse. That's not a complaint, just a statement. The food was good enough that we'll be back. I'm just hoping the service improves by then."}
{"text":"Just saying this place is an actual log cabin doesn't do it justice. Inside, the cozy one-room restaurant's log walls are polished to a warm glow right up to the gabled rafters--all the decor needed. Cream linen table cloths and soft sconce lighting add a touch of elegance to support the quality menu, but the ambiance and friendly staff keep a relaxed feel. Our meal had not one mis-step. Service and timing was great, steaks were the best we've had in a long time--and we loved our crispy peach crisp and flourless chocolate cake desserts. Be sure to call ahead for reservations!"}
{"text":"The jumbo shrimps portion was not enough and over priced , small sitting area , loud noise  
I don't think i will try it again"}
{"text":"Reliable quotidian steakhouse. The food and service are predictably good. This is a fantastic place to take the in laws. There isn't anything exciting or inventive here. The menu is the same as a few of their other restaurants, but the quality is good and you know what to expect."}
{"text":"The Cabin Club offers outstanding steaks paired with an excellent wine selection.  If you are looking for a truly marvelous dining experience I would recommend sitting at the bar, the service from the bartenders (Katie and Tracy) is really exquisite,  They were very attentive and anticipated my needs without me even having to ask for a refill.  I would also suggest you try their outstanding ribs or the cowboy steak (a wonderful bone in rib eye not on the menu)."}
{"text":"one of my favorite places to go for a great steak or a late night drink. highly recommend for a good date night. not a large place so reservations are a must.
i love the toppings, sauteed mushrooms, crab, to name a few. great spot on the near westside."}
{"text":"Quite simply, a great meal!

The food:  As an appetizer, we split the sampler and it was very good.  The calamari were perfectly cooked, tender and lightly breaded.  The buffalo spring rolls were crispy and zesty.  The BBQ shrimp were tasty and the sauce on them was delicious, but there was just a little too much on there.

The special of the night of my visit was a rack of lamb with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The lamb was tender, juicy and cooked to perfection. 

My sister ordered the Java-Crusted Sirloin and it was delicious.  Well-seasoned and tender!  My parents ordered the Steak Christopher and absolutely loved it.

The service:...was outstanding!  Our waitress was attentive, slightly sassy, and very, very good!  She was able to talk in detail about everything on the menu...a lost art in this world of crappy chain places!  The management team clearly knows what it's doing with their staff!

Reservations are a must, as this place is very small.  

Great job!"}
{"text":"Always have a nice meal!  Cozy atmosphere with very good food.   Steaks are very good and so is calamari.   Very nice people.  Always look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"We were in town for a long weekend and decided to  find a nice steakhouse and have an elegant date nite out.  And we hit the jackpot!  The service was great, very attentive server.  The meal was excellent, we shared the appetizer platter and then we both ordered the 7oz fillet, Steak Christopher style....very good.  The manager came over and asked us how we were doing and of course we told her how much we enjoyed the dinner, the atmosphere and service.  She gave us a little history lesson of the building and it was all very interesting.  It is a little on the pricey side, say $50 per person plus drinks, for a special occasion it is so worth it!  We didn't finish our bottle of wine and they sealed it up for take home.    Also, Our reservation was for  8:30, there was no wait on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"First time eating at the Cabin. The atmosphere and food lived up to and exceed the reviews I've read  / recommendations I was told."}
{"text":"I was surprised when I arrived at 8:30 not to find a place at the bar. After waiting for about 15 min one opened up and was immediately greeted by two lovely waitstaff. I know what I wanted after reviewing the menu online, ordering steak Christopher and the house salad, I said I would pass on the bread.  I really enjoyed the cabin salad) on of the best) with their house dressing. The steak was juicy and cooked perfectly along with some asparagus and shrimp.  This was by far the best deal on the menu. It was a bit loud but definitely a neat place to go, now one of my Cleveland favorites."}
{"text":"Mediocre steak I've been here many times before and it's hit or miss on the service. The atmosphere is nice I have a cocktail in but I like a good bar area."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal at the Cabin Club to celebrate my father's birthday. The drinks were amazing, the food was delicious and our server, Leilani was wonderful. We really enjoyed our meal and I hope to go back soon.

My only complaint is that this restaurant is not handicap accessible. There is no ramp into the restaurant and the restrooms are not equipped to serve someone in a wheel chair."}
{"text":"What a great experience.  I took my brother in law and priest from our church there Friday Sept 30th.   Sat at the bar and the  bartender Amy was excellent.  Pleasant, arranged for our table, and great with our drinks   Once seated, Sara took our order.  I had the blackened blue Delmonico.  My guests both had the Duroc Pork Chop. All were prepared perfectly.  Well done Cabin Club"}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times always excellent. Very high quality steaks and best burger in Cleveland (in my humble opinion)"}
{"text":"We love sitting at the bar and having dinner. Great food and lovely wine list. The Cabin Club is one of my very favorite restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here.  Our server gave us a fantastic Pinot Noir recommendation which we'll definitely add to our list of favorites.  

The blackened scallop appetizer was outstanding.  I don't know what they put in that sauce (some kind of mustard maybe?), but I sopped it all up with my bread. The lobster bisque was delicious - comparable to Pier W.  Because of this bisque, I was unable to finish most of my meal :) My filet was cooked perfectly, just as I requested, as was my lobster tail.  

The table next to us had several children seated at it, which I thought would be a nuissnace, but I hardly noticed them.  The prices were not as high as I thought they would be either.  

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This time I went for dinner and it was a much better experience! Made a reservation and I liked how that asked if it was for a special occasion, which was for my birthday. I went to Red steakhouse in beachwood last year and it wasn't even asked nor acknowledged. 

We were seated right away and greeted with water and warm fresh bread with whipped butter that was to die for! I ordered the house Malbec which was awesome! The French onion soup which surprisingly came with the meal was typical French onion but good. Caesar salad was not that fresh and very bland dressing which I was shocked about, so I'd pass on that. We both ordered the Steak Christopher which is two 3-4oz filets toped with two jumbo shrimp and finished with bernaise. It comes with asparagus and garlic mash but I had to sub for the famous lobster mash that I always get at Blue point as well! Can we say delish!! Loved my meal! To top it all off I was greeted with a delicious chocolate mouse shooter with Oreo crumble, compliments of the house for my birthday! Service was a bit slow but it was sat night at 6:30 so you'll have that. Cabin club redeemed themselves for dinner. I may have to give happy hour another try?"}
{"text":"This place is not worth stopping in. First off, they don't know how to cook sausage stuffed mushrooms. In all the places I have ordered this at, not one every gave a sausage meatball in a mushroom cap and had the nerve to call it sausage stuffed mushrooms. Even Olive Garden has outstanding stuffed mushrooms. Then to bring out  Crispy Fried Calamari that was undercooked is nervey and who in their right mind cuts crab legs down the middle and brings you the pliers to break what apart. They took all the fun out of it. The whole idea of crab legs it to break them apart yourself. Then they don't even bring the tiny fork to scoop out the crapo meat and by the time we got them, they were COLD, not hot, not warm, but COLD.  This is going to blow your mind, their fresh market catch of the day was scallops, which they already have on their menu.  The whole idea of the fresh market catch is to have something different, they don't even have any fish on their menu. The entire meal was a major, major joke. We really screwed ourselves this anniversary by picking this aweful place. We will never ever recommend this to our friends or enemies. I don't know how anyone can give this place 5 stars, must be people that have never ever tasted outstanding food. The waitress (Jennifer) was very good, but that is not reason enought to ever be back."}
{"text":"Steaks are always great.  Nice atmosphere.  Good happy hour menu at the bar. They bartenders know how to make a good drink!"}
{"text":"We always look forward to celebrating big occasions and this is our usual spot for a good night out. The service has always been excellent and although the bill is more expensive than most steak house chains, it is money well spent!"}
{"text":"When I visit Westlake I usually have lunch at the Cabin Club.  My favorite luncheon plate is the scrod with vegetables and a salad.  Their scrod is superb....I have yet to find a restaurant that has that has a better presentation of this fish or taste.  The service is always  terrific as well."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dinner we had.  Service superb.  We sat at the bar.  Best steak I ever had.  Lobster bisque is to die for.  Manager on duty was a large man, don't know his name, seemed to micro manage the staff.  He should take a step back and let the wait staff do what they do best.!   Otherwise, we will be back.  Thank you Cabin Club"}
{"text":"We've heard about the Cabin Club for some time and were anxious to experience it for ourselves. The atmosphere was warm and inviting which was perfect on this cool October evening. Unfortunately that's where the positives end. 

 The service was average at best as our party of 4 seemed to be more of a nuisance to our server then anything else. While that was unfortunate, the real disappointment came when the food arrived. The spinach salad came loaded with raw onions even after we requested NO onions. The \"special\" bone-in ribeye was over done. Prepared medium was described to us as a bright pink center. Instead we were greeted with a hot grey center, portions of which were down right dry. It's possible the reason for this was that it was the thinnest cut of ribeye we've ever come across, chuckling on our way home that our cuts at Costco are better. 

Had we been by ourselves we would have asked to speak with a manager but we were with friends and did not want them to feel uncomfortable. 

Underwhelmed is the word of the day for our first experience at the Cabin Club."}
{"text":"Wonderful as always!! Lobster bisque was delicious, steak seasoned well and cooked perfectly. Creamed corn was fantastic(one of the few things we haven't tried). Creme brûlée was perfect end to the meal. Service is incredible every time. Can not wait for our next trip!"}
{"text":"Last night my wife and son took me to The Cabin Club for my birthday. Everything was perfect and the steak was just the way I like it, in fact all of us had steak and all came out just as we requested! Great place we will. E back!"}
{"text":"Always great steaks and love the change of specials. Very nice place to go."}
{"text":"I took my aunt out to dinner here. We arrived early for our reservation and were seated immediately. We got menus quickly and efficient service up until our entrees were brought to the table. The food was quite good, but the service became nonexistent: I had to ask for more water after my glass was empty for some time; after our dirty dishes sat on the table for a while, the maitre 'd stopped by to check on us but said there was nothing (e.g. no tasks) that she was allowed to do. Finally, our server brought us the check, without ever asking if we wanted dessert or coffee. I had wanted coffee, which she then brought at no charge because \"you had to wait so long.\"  

The restaurant was fairly full and our server seemed to be responsible for a large number of tables, but for a high end, expensive restaurant, customers ought to be attended to, not left to fend for themselves."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant with superior service and very good food.  I have a gluten allergy and they are so well educated and careful, and besides the food is so well made that a lot of it is naturally gluten free."}
{"text":"Five very solid stars!

My loved one and I were meeting his father at the Cabin Club.  All of us are from several states away.  Since we are not familiar with Cleveland restaurants, we were literally taking a chance on Cabin Club.  Wow, am I glad we did.

Our experience here was perfection.  My BF's father waited for us at the bar.  He said that he could tell that most of the people there were locals.  It was Friday night, and the place was packed but not overly-so.  The atmosphere is energetic yet still comforting.

We were immediately seated at a nice corner booth where we would be able to talk to each other.  From the get-go until we were done, our waitress, JoAnn (I hope that is right) was outstanding.  What a pro!  She was both patient and sharp.  She was helpful and unassuming with the wine list.  She didn't flinch and was extremely informative when my picky BF ordered his meal and asked about every single aspect of what was served with it.  She insisted he get the salad dressing on the side and then followed up later to make sure he liked it.  She also didn't flinch when my BF's father made a meal out of three appetizers.  The way they served it was beautiful, too.  Finally, we hogged her booth almost all evening, and not for a moment did I get the impression she was trying to rush us or get rid of us.  She and the rest of the staff visibly work hard and do a great job at making everyone feel at home.

But just as much as the service, we would come back for the amazing food.  Where to start?  My (remember, picky) BF had \"the best pork chop of his life\".  Seriously, it did look huge and juicy; bone in with rice and green beans.  I had shrimp and scallops over lobster mashed.  Whoever invented this dish must be an angel, but the way it was cooked and put together is what made it amazing.  The shrimp were deliciously grilled; the scallops perfect in texture, and the mashed flavorful and not overly greasy/buttery like some places.  Unfortunately, I could not finish it after all of the french onion soup and bread I'd had. :( !  All of the food was really, really, really great and definitely unlike any food we get anywhere else.  (Side note: I live in Phoenix/Scottsdale, and there are a lot of amazing restaurants, but still no food even close to what Cabin Club's is like).  

Finally, I am NOT a dessert person at all, but we ordered a peach cobbler.  The men scooped it down, and I had a bite or two.  Let's just say that there is no disappointment in this dessert.  Not too sugary-sweet, cooked with fresh peaches, and topped with quality ice cream.  It was just plain tasty.

The feel of the cabin, the \"old\" bathrooms, and the \"slight imperfections\" of the buildling, to me, are what makes this place so comfortable.  Except for the freezing cold air conditioning, I felt very much at home here.  Next time we are in Cleveland, I can guarantee we'll be making reservations here again.  We had a truly special evening here with uniquely amazing food."}
{"text":"Awesome very friendly stuff. The manager was really good. I ordered a steak and it's a little dry because I asked them for medium well but they happily gave me new plate with my steak medium.. Good job!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have had a gift certificate to this restaurant for quite some time, and last night we finally got around to using it.  The Cabin Club has a rustic feel on the inside, with close tables making for a \"bustling\" atmosphere.  The place was decorated for the holidays and it looked lovely.  Our server took great care of us the entire night, which we really appreciated.

We each ordered a (different) glass of red wine, in preparations for the steaks we would order later.  My wife was able to taste a few different varieties before settling in on her preferred glass.

A basket of warm bread was brought to the table, along with butter.  The sourdough bread was yeasty and delicious, but the butter could have used a bit more pizzazz (it almost tasted like unsalted butter).

My wife ordered a Caesar salad and I had a cup of their French onion soup.  The soup was hearty and the onions almost transparent in color.  The melted cheese had the perfect amount of salty goodness to offset the both and onions...it was a great cup of soup!

For our entrees, I ordered the filet mignon and my wife had the steak Christopher.  We each ordered them medium-rare+.  As a side to my steak, I got the creamed spinach and we also shared their famous sizzling mushroom platter (which the server suggested we get a half order of).

My steak arrived in perfect condition, but my wife's was much closer to rare.  The manager happen to be checking in on table who had recently received their dishes, so his arrival was perfect timing.  He apologized profusely and took my wife's dish back for some additional time under the broiler.  When it returned, it was just as she had ordered.  The quality of their meat is superb, and the accompanying Bearnaise dipping sauce hit the spot with tons of rich butter in it.  My creamed spinach was a mountain on my plate, and we took half of it home.  The sizzling mushrooms had to have been cooked in some sort of vinegar as they had a wonderful pop and kick when you bit into them.

As a show of good faith (due to the steak temp incident), our server offered to comp us a dessert and we chose their creme brulee which had an incredibly crispy crust and super-creamy custard underneath.  It was a great way to finish the evening and we appreciated everything the staff did to accommodate us throughout the meal."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch and dinner and really enjoyed both. The atmosphere feels a little formal for dinner, but more casual (and affordable) for a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Being a chef myself I don't say this to often about my many adventures in food but this place has phenomenally good food. Impressive in all aspect professional service and outstanding food. A true gem of Ohio. I would definitely return without hesitation. I came in without a reservation but they were so kind and willing to let us have a meal. If you have the time and your in west lake Ohio reserve a table you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Excellent food for a premium price. Service is always great. Can be a bit noisy on busy nights. If you wish to eat at the bar, you can. Great for appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"great atmosphere and good food..I know it was close to closing time but as a restaurant and a chef you still have to execute every dish to its finest especially when your paying $30+ a dish.. Ordered a steak med/well and not cooked to temp.. The chef did not let my steak rest and served on my dish with blood on my dish.. Def a sign of lazy from chef if there's a certified chef in kitchen or just an experience cook...will be back but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour - great food great price. Women Bartenders RUDE and UNFRIENDLY!! Especially if a FEMALE!! Cater to MEN REGULARS!! Need a Younger and More Friendly Bartenders!!"}
{"text":"Casual, higher end food. Great place to relax near Cleveland. Mouse made the evening go well"}
{"text":"Although it is not an inexpensive dining experience, the quality of the food and excellent atmosphere is worth the expense! It's perfect for special occasions and dressing up is an expectation on weekends. We are particular fans of the Surf n Turf and the Chocolate Mousse is simply delicious! Be sure to call ahead for reservations and dress code for the evening (it depends on the night)!"}
{"text":"anniversary tonight, always had a good meal last couple times, this time steaks overdone, taters cold, 100 dollar meal average at best, sorry"}
{"text":"Always a great meal, fantastic service and creative menu.  Try the buffalo spring rolls, lobster bisque and their express lunch if you pop in for lunch."}
{"text":"Sorry, was not impressed by this place.  The best steak in Cleveland is \"Red, The Steakhouse,\" actually it's near Beachwood.  I will give Cabin Club this: the server that I had was a super model."}
{"text":"OK I had to write a review....when my husband took his new job in Cleveland it was one of the first questions I asked... Was Cabin Club still in business?  It had been at least 15 years since my first trip to CC and from the first day of my week long stay in Cleveland... I went 4 times!  This place in amazing!  Steaks are the best! The sides are awesome! Service is top notch! Not really for kids but we had a couple with us who's babysitter cancelled at the last minute so we the 2 year old....and the chef made her mac-n-cheese...at the time it wasn't on the menu.  But after they brought it to our table the entire restaurant was trying to order....so I'm sure it's on the menu by now!  ; ) AWESOME place!"}
{"text":"I flew in from California to have dinner with my mom who was on hospice . The service from Anndrea was fantastic. Good place"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I've been to a ton of steakhouses in my day.  Not all of them, by any means, but a lot.  

Cabin Club came highly recommended and delivered.  SUPER small place, but I liked that about it.  Make a reservation, or you might wait a long, long time to get a seat (if you get a seat at all).  We got lucky the night we went and did NOT make a reservation, but one family happened to be leaving and it was a Sunday night. 

The service was top-notch.  Great server - I wish I remembered her name.  She deserved the good tip we left her.  The Manhattan I had was great and the wine list, extensive enough, but not huge by any means.  They have a lot of awards for their wine list from back in the 90's, but it's clear that they haven't kept the large inventory up anymore, but it's not a big deal.  Just don't come here if that's what you heard.

There is no rib-eye on the normal a la carte menu, which surprised me...but I was pleasantly surprised when they had a bone-in rib-eye as a special that night, which was really, really good.  The lobster mashed potatoes were okay, but I'm not a huge potato fan.  

Everyone really seemed to enjoy their meal and we had a great time.  Would definitely recommend it.  The only reason for not giving it a 5-star is b/c I've had better steak before with more selection at other steakhouses.  Otherwise, this place is great."}
{"text":"Two words: Lobster Bisque. 

Do not go to Cabin Club without ordering the Lobster Bisque. There are no exceptions. 

Service and food are always a plus here. Food is fantastic and you cannot beat the deals available during the working day at lunch - the price you pay for the food you get is spot on. Don't change a thing. 

The only thing I would add is some aspects of the restaurant are slightly in need of repair/updating. For example, there is a vent/heating/cooling duct in the restaurant that has one of those plastic covers hanging from it. The lighting can sometimes always be shining right in your face depending where you sit in the restaurant too. 

I've taken customers here for lunch on occasion twice now (1) had to move because of the vent blowing cold air on her - I switched seats with her and it was literally blowing right in my face, and (2) the lighting again - seriously blinding. 

Other than that, again: Lobster Bisque."}
{"text":"Stopped in about a year ago to get a drink and ordered their Chocolate Mouse. It was to die for and my wife is not a fan of chocolate. I had ordered one because she did not want any sweets. I gve her the second bite and she took it away from me. LOL love is so giving.  She took me back on the forth os April for a romantic dinner the night before I turned Sixty.  We should have gotten reservations but the manager squeezed us in at a little corner table. The food was faboulious and the wait staff was friendly, efficient with out being intrusive. We had a wonderful time. Considering the quality of food the bill was reasonable. Service got a tip that goggled my wife's eyes.

I can not recommend this restraunt enough."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was excellent service was great.   We loved it.  Server was very pleasant her name is Lailoni(she's Hawaiian). Must try"}
{"text":"Lobster bisque...yum! Saw that some raved about the bread, meh...chewy and heading toward hard; not impressive. Cabin Club salad was good. I picked the ham slices out and found the lemon dressing a bit sweet, but it was tasty nonetheless. 
They brought me the wrong steak. Had to return it. Brought me jumbo shrimp to apologize. My sister's steak was too well done and burnt around the edges. Sent it back. Overall, not the best experience. This was our first time and it really left is disappointed. When I got the right steak, the center cut filet, it was a little underdone, but on a hot plate so I could cook it more. Much better than the first try. 
At least I can check it off my list now. The manager assured us that this is not the norm and from the other reviews I know that is true. They also gave us complimentary desserts which were excellent--creme brûlée and peach crisp ala mode."}
{"text":"I had the best Club sandwich I have ever eaten today. They call it the \"Country Club\". This was worth the rating of 5 stars! Service was top notch. Best kept secret for lunch on the west side. A must try! I have lunch here at least once a week, but today was different. This sandwich rocks! I love the Blackened scallops or the steak and spinach salad. ~Cheers JB"}
{"text":"When I think great steakhouse in Cleveland the Cabin Club is always my first choice.

Great cozy intimate atmosphere.  It's literally a log cabin - hence the name.

Passing by from the outside it doesn't look like much, but once you step through the doors you can tell immediately that you're about to get an amazing meal.

Lobster hush puppies are my favorite starter.  The blacked bleu delmonico is out of this world, too!

After a hard day of work, or to celebrate a special occasion the Cabin Club is in my opinion the best place.  It's been the far westside's best little secret for many many years."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Outstanding service (Dana)
Wonderful filet oscar.
Terrific to see a place like this remain successful ~ they deserve success!
Delicious!"}
{"text":"Good food, good bar and good location. The thing I hate about this place is when you check in to be seated for dinner they tell you when they need the table back. Literally the time they are going to kick you out. It's insulting, it rushes you and overpowers the food with stress. Probably not doing dinner here again since this has happened 4 or 5 times now."}
{"text":"Bleh. Subpar food all around. Slow, inattentive service. Lackluster atmosphere. Overpriced and overrated."}
{"text":"let me start out by saying this place has the absolute best lobster bisque!! even better than delmonico's (sorry guys. more lobster per bite.) i got the chicken marsala and my boyfriend got filet mignon. he said his filet was in the top 5 best steaks he's ever had. mine was also very good. it's a bit more pricey than comparable places.. the thing that really got my attention was THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. oh my gosh. i can't say enough about it. our waitress was adorable and so personable. she filled our wine glasses every time she came to check on us, which is always amazing (i can't remember her name, but i'm also terrible with names. so sorry...) the owner/manager came around and personally checked on each table multiple times. every restaurant should strive for this level of service."}
{"text":"This is my go to steak place.  I've been going to the Cabin Club for many years, maybe more than 15 or 16.  I have yet to have a steak here that was not the best.  I always order the 18 oz. cowboy ribeye, (which for some reason is not always on the menu but they always seem to have it).  It's a big slice of heaven for me.  The service is A+.  The food is A+.  The prices are appropriate for the quality of food served."}
{"text":"I have had excellent meals at The Cabin Club before, but they really out did themselves last night.  Offering a prime, bone in rib eye that was probably the best steak I have ever eaten.
Couple this with attentive service, a nice wine list, and a very comfortable room makes dining at The Cabin Club an outstanding experience."}
{"text":"I have been to CC many times and have never been disappointed. The lobster bisque and steak christopher are fantastic. Great ambiance with attentive and pleasant wait staff."}
{"text":"I went for Mother's Day with my family. Service was beyond my expectations. Everyone's meal was really great. Mom had ribs that she really liked, tender and falling off the bone. My steak was cooked exactly how I like it. The fish dishes were good too."}
{"text":"Place is a nice semi casual dining atmosphere with prices that seem to be reasonable for the quality of food.  The bar is a nice place to hang out while waiting for a table if you get there a bit earlier than your reservation. Overall service was amazing and the food was perfect."}
{"text":"Great steaks and good service. Laeticia Estate Pinot Noir is now one of my favorites. Great food and wine."}
{"text":"While the space is nice and the atmosphere unique the reason you go to a restaurant is the food and the food here just barely rates an OK. We did enjoy the lobster bisque but her salmon BLT was bland and his grilled chicken had an odd texture with no discernible flavor. We skipped dessert, expecting more average. Sorry, but not much here to recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now for lunch with colleagues. The food never disappoints. Their lunch specials are always good and the prices are very decent for the high quality of food and service you receive."}
{"text":"I could not be more turned off from this place nor have I ever been treated so rudely. 
1. This place needs to have online reservations. I called several times and no one answered then when I  finally got through they said we could come in with no reservation. No problem. 
2. We arrived early just in case and were turned away because we weren't \"regulars and there is a priority for people not like you\". How disgusting. Get over yourselves."}
{"text":"Holy happy hour!! One of the best happy hours in town. The place is the cutest cozy little cabin in the and in the middle of Westlake and feels like a mini escape from the world. Very quaint. I've only been for happy hour on Sunday (from 4-9) and you can't beat it! Shrimp and grits and a steak are on the HH menu and so are dirty martinis (WITH blue cheese olives.) Sunday funday anyone?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times over the past 5 years.

The food is excellent and service is top notch.

Smaller place that originally was a log cabin but very nice inside and out.

A little pricey but always a good choice."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with a party of four. 3 steak christophers and 1 baby back ribs.
We were all very happy from the salad and lobster hushpuppies to the mains.
Also, mentioned by nearly all diners, the lobster bisque was amazing."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding place to eat. Best service and food I've had in a long time.  You get what you pay for.  I usually like my meat medium well but here I get it medium rare with lots of bold flavor."}
{"text":"Great food and service! I recommend making a reservation ahead of time due to the size of the restaurant, but overall, this is one of my favorite places to go around Westlake."}
{"text":"I am, or was, a regular. That makes tonight all the harder to understand. When you undercook, I mean to the point of raw through the middle, a 46 dollar steak, you comp it. If I didn't eat you don't make me pay for it. You want to insist on it? I am sick to my stomach. You argued with me. No problem. I paid. You won. Did you? A steak restaurant that undercooked and overcharged a regular patron. Sad state of affairs for what used to be the standard bearer of red meat on the westside of Cleveland. 

Don't worry, I will be there to chronicle your downfall. 

But I was rooting for you the whole time; until you decided I wasn't worth your time."}
{"text":"I've been to Cabin Club three times now--all for dinner.  It's a very small restaurant--literally a cabin, hence the title.  Adding to the charm, the staff was very friendly and attentive.

I definitely had no problems with the steak on my first two visits.  The third time, however, I went on a mission to compare it directly to XO Prime Steaks where I had lunched a few weeks earlier.  Coincidentally, the special that night was a bone-in ribeye--exactly what I had at XO.  Almost with regret, I have to say that the XO steak won the match.  The Cabin Club bone-in ribeye tasted almost flat by comparison.

The saga continues; I'm sure that these won't be my last visits to these restaurants.  I remain a fan of Cabin Club."}
{"text":"Yeah, this was good.  A little out of the ordinary, but that's to be expected from an independent (non-chain) restaurant.  

I stopped in for a business lunch with a couple of associates, not sure of what to expect.  After all, the place looks line a log cabin from the outside, hence the name.  But it also looks like a log cabin from the inside (you were expecting that, right?). But, (and here it is:) it's a steak house featuring higher end fare.

At the recommendation of my associate, I had the Lobster Bisque for an appetizer.  Rich, creamy, flavourful with chunks of lobster, its a great start to any meal at the Cabin Club.

The Chicken Paprikash with Spaetzle looked really enticing (definitely not a log cabin meal), but I settled on the Chicken Marsala.  This was a large, moist chicken breast, fried with an addictive crunch to the outside, smothered in some of the freshest mushrooms I've tasted, and a rich brown gravy that justified the big mound of Garlic Mashed potatoes. 

I tried to leave some of the potato behind to limit my carbs, but it was hard to do.  I tried to leave after the meal, but that was also hard to do.  If I wasn't so full, I would have ordered dinner right away.

I hope I can make it back to try the steak someday!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is a nice cozy log cabin. Small restaurant with a decent sized bar spanning the back of the restaurant. We opted to sit at the bar for the end of happy hour and decided to stay there to eat. The service was a bit slow and the food was good, but not great (not really worth the price in our opinion)."}
{"text":"Lobster Bisque is the absolute BEST. Everything, especially the steak, was great. Go here for steaks & seafood....pasta is not what they do."}
{"text":"Exceptional product, exceptional service. Their food is top of the line. Atmosphere is quaint and relaxing. Portions are large and prices are reasonable. I always suggest cabin club to everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is a great restaurant, and the prices for a \"prime\" steakhouse are reasonable because you don't have to purchase your salad and sides separately. The filet is delicious and cooked to order with their terrific Yukon gold potato pancakes. The house salad is nice with a bit of cheese and some ham in addition to a tasty vinaigrette. One of the best features is the hot bread. 

Service is excellent. The place is pretty small though, and tables are close together - not always good for a private business conversation. The ambiance is relaxed - a big open room inside a rustic log cabin. 

I love Hyde Park, but this place is the better value, and is on par with the food at Hyde Park. It's also just beyond the Hyde Park on Detroit Road. 

Call for a reservation TODAY."}
{"text":"I love this quaint place for a good steak and lobster bisque. Expect to pay some money but it's one of the better steak places around westlake. The atmosphere is unique with a cabin interior and exterior."}
{"text":"From the first steps in the door, the hosts and servers, the wine list and menu, and the meal (perfect steak) I consider this my new favorite Cleveland spot.  A lucky Chicagoan introduced by some local friends who have known CC for years, this place is special and I will be back."}
{"text":"I wanted to treat my boyfriend to a nice dinner for our two-year anniversary. I came across this steak house online and found their menu to be mouth-watering. We arrived to a cozy, low-lit atmosphere with extremely friendly staff. Our reservation time was immediately accommodated and we were promptly seated in a quiet corner (when you call to make your reservation, they ask if it's for a special occasion and what it is) Our server was pleasantly chatty and treated us as though I'd imagine she would if she were waiting on family members. We shared drinks, an appetizer, and steaks - all of which were mouthwatering from start to finish.  My steak was large enough that I had leftovers that were perfectly boxed up and enjoyed the next day. A complimentary dessert was brought out in honor of our special day as well. Every part of our visit was phenomenal and worth every dollar spent. We will certainly be back to visit this exquisite Westlake dining treasure."}
{"text":"ok, yes great steaks!  and the deviled eggs are awesome.  and the service is too notch.  but please, the sizzling mushroom dish has no place in an upscale restaurant.  if i wanted to smell like someone else's dinner, i'd get a job in a kitchen, or eat at an applebees."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant at the beginning of November. Prior to that I have not been there for a few years. I have to say I was a little disappointed in the quality of food since I've last been there. There is so many different options now in Cleveland to go get a great steak and the ribeye special that I had was mediocre at best. The worst part was that I took my boss there and she had a very mediocre meals well The service however was halfway decent and the atmosphere was normal cabin club. I would just like it if they concentrated a little more on their quality of food and presentation when they are competing with the others in the area like red the steakhouse and strip steak house just to name a few."}
{"text":"Wonderfull Valentines Day meal and service."}
{"text":"Came for a birthday dinner and being new to the area we were happy to find a new place we like.  The atmosphere is a bar/restaurant mix and the cabin atmosphere is wonderful.  The Christmas decorations added to the ambiance.   

We shared a bottle of Malbec that was reasonably priced.  I had the Steak Christopher which was served with 2 prawns, garlic mashed and 1 spear of asparagus.   Generous portions and everything cooked to perfection.   My husband had surf and turf and loved every bite.

They served a chocolate mousse as a birthday treat which was very good.  

All in all, great choice with decent service and great food."}
{"text":"My phone is ringing and it's the Cabin Club short ribs calling.......Yum yum!   You must note that I get one dish & one dish only here so keep that in mind for my review. It's totally biased.  Cabin Club hands down has the best Braised Beef Short Ribs I've ever had and they keep me coming back......decor is a bit campy for me but I think overall, it's a local CLE based chain as part of a larger group of local restaurants with great food and the bar/restaurant is always packed so it must be good.  I'm glad the Crocker Park Mall chains haven't affected the business here @ CC. Decent wine list too....some hard to find labels are on the menu (Duckhorn, Stags Leap)."}
{"text":"A group of us visited the Cabin Club for dinner on a Tuesday evening.

The place was packed on a Tuesday evening, fortunately our group had a reservation.

I went with the Caesar salad and the Cedar-planked Salmon with sides of Asparagus and Broccoli.

All of the food was delicious - I ordered the Salmon medium rare, it came out cooked more than that - but it was still scrumptious - I was not about to send it back!

The service was impeccable and the ambiance is warm and inviting with a bit of a woodsy, folksy feel, yet still feels upscale.

They also have a nice bar - would be a good place to come for drinks. They had a nice craft beer selection - but I was driving and so abstained from any such beverages. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Upscale but not stuffy! We love Cabin Club and it was our go to steakhouse when we lived in the area.  Being from Kansas City, we were excited to find a wonderful steakhouse that reminded us of home.  The cozy atmosphere helped us to feel we could just sit back, enjoy our meal, and have a glass (or 2) of wine.  Filets melted in your mouth!  French onion soup was bursting with flavor! And I could never go wrong with the loaded baked potato.   Get your reservations in and I promise  you will have a great meal."}
{"text":"Terrific place.  Lunch and service were outstanding.  Prices are fair. The place offers a triple for $12, which includes choice of soups, choice of salads and choice of a small sandwich.  Each one was delicious.  My only \"complaint\" is that is located too far from my home, or I would be a regular.  I am jealous of those of you who live nearby.  It is owned by a restaurant group which owns several different style restaurants in the Cleveland area and each is well managed and appealing."}
{"text":"We went to Cabin Club for our 6 mo wedding anniversary. Service was amazing, our waitress was very sweet and attentive. I had the filet mignon with mushrooms and the mushroom and goat cheese ravioli... Very good and huge portions, I had to take some home in a box!! We enjoyed a bottle of wine, and we got a complimentary dessert for our celebration. My only real complaint was the fact that my husband and I were clearly the youngest people in the establishment... By many, many decades. The ambiance of the cabin setting was otherwise wonderful and we had a lovely meal!"}
{"text":"This place specializes in steak and they do a pretty great job. It's constantly busy so reservations are recommended. The service was decent and the cucumber mojito was great. The atmosphere is a nice steakhouse feel with, of course, cabin-like decor. It is a more expensive steakhouse but they also have a great seafood menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant sparked our interest because of its mystery. It is a log cabin, in the middle of a shopping center street. The shades are always in a sweet way. So we had to go. The restaurant is warm and cozy. The staff was very friendly and helpful with wine selections based on our meal choices. I ordered the salmon and my husband ordered the steak. We were both satisfied with our meals. My salmon was cooked very well. His steak was VERY good and the better of the two meals. The lighting was romanticly dim. The food looked beautiful. It's the kind of place where you sit a little taller in your chair because you know you're at a fancy place and you want to make it known that you belong. My only negative was that this feeling was juxtaposed by Katy Perry and Coldplay. We told the owner to consider changing this music choice to old jazz or big band music or even a soft piano. He was kind and responsive. I would be curious to see if they made any changes in the past couple months to really stick to their brand. They are still a hidden gem."}
{"text":"After eating here last night, I was so full and happy that I went to bed and had a great night's sleep. The appetizers (baked artichoke dip and calamari) were delicious but the steak (center cut filet mignon) with a side of broccoli was divine. Best steak I've had in a long time.

I also had the French onion soup which is different than a traditional clean onion soup. There was more flavor in the broth and I believe the crouton was toasted. For dessert I had the cheesecake which was caramel that night (chef's choice). It was a true light but still rich cheesecake with just enough caramel flavor.

The decor had a warm but sophisticated feeling just like the name implies. Finally the service was excellent. There was a snow storm that night and we had friends coming from afar. So we say, drank, and ate appetizers for an hour before ordering and they were always attentive and genuinely friendly."}
{"text":"went to the cabin club restaurant for the first time in probably 15 years......with hope that it was better than i remembered.  atmosphere is very cosy (and tight), if you're not along the walls, in a booth, you'll be continuously brushed up against by quick moving staff and customers.......it has a more of an \"old boys club\" feel. the diningroom was peppered with mostly middle to older men, so was the bar. seems like a place my dad would hang out in more than me. service is slow, but friendly. ours left most of the dirty plates on the table and would only remove them when prompted by us. steaks are good, but nothing special. you can get a good steak at many restaurants in cleveland. what makes a great \"steakhouse\" is a large choice of delicious sides to accompany the steaks. the walleye fish special was delicious, the green beans crisp, but the pumpkin goat cheese risotto was terrible. i had forgotten what the flavor was supposed to be, because there was no flavor. the rice was crunchy, not cooked and was all clumped together in this pasty, flavorless glue. when the server ask how our dinners were, at the end of the meal, she could see that the risotto was left on 2 plates. when i explained that they were not good, she quickly answered, \"well i didn't make them!\" i found that to be odd. i never implied that she made them, i always thought that a server was the liason between the customer and the kitchen. 
service is friendly but a bit unpolished. roving manager is friendly but akward at conversation. 
overall, nice place, but nothing special. if i'd return, it would be to have a couple of appetizers and cocktails at the bar and go someplace else for dinner. great for an older crowd."}
{"text":"My wife and I are new to the area and in looking for a a more upscale restaurant to celebrate my wife's birthday, I discovered The Cabin Club. We both were very pleased with our choice. Although not the most romantic place (the place is small and a large part of the restaurant consists of a bar that can be quite loud), the food is very good. I had surf and turf. My wife had filet mignon. We both enjoyed our meal. The service was decent, but not great (our server disappeared for the last part of our meal). The price is reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Yeah definitely a solid 4 stars. The atmosphere is great - a hunting lodge feel (cabin indeed!) with studio lighting and quirky window shades featuring bookshelf illustrations. I had a really great cut of Strip steak, cooked really well. I've had better, but it was really great and hit the spot pretty hardcore. My company had tbone and troat and they loved their food as well. Also, the banana bread pudding and the lemon cheesecake are definitely worth trying. Solid."}
{"text":"Went there for our anniversary, based on a friend's recommendation. It was wonderful! Even with the wait, still a great experience!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since our last visit to Cabin Club and this experience was excellent. We had taken our friends there for a holiday dinner and enjoyed great steaks, good wine and good service. We now live in the D.C. Area and the prices at the Cabin Club are good for a high end steak house. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We live in California and were out visiting our son and family.  Our son, who lives in Brooklyn, OH recommended the restaurant so we went there for his birthday. There were 5 in the group - including our 1 year old granddaughter.  You wouldn't think a place like this was ideal for babies - but you're wrong.  They were FANTASTIC.  When we arrived, the table was set with her high chair in place and nothing around it to cause a problem.  That's right, no sharp utensils or stemware.  Perfect.  The manager came over to insure everything was to our satisfaction (it was).  Food was excellent from steak, to crab legs to chicken.  But the nicest part was when the baby needed a diaper change.  The bathroom wasn't able to handle this task so they took my daughter-in-law downstairs and into a private area where she could be changed and brought back up to the restaurant.  Now that's customer service.  Loved the log cabin ambiance.  So go for the food - - and bring the kids!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner for 2 here and it was a total 5 star experience !! The music, the ambience, the staff who was SUPER attentive and well spoken, steaks that melt in your mouth and even the manager came over to ask how was everything. Cleveland needs more places like this.
As for food, this might be my new favorite steakhouse! I'm a total carnivore and I've been in countless steakhouses around the country and this one is up there! Filet mignon and sirloin are both very good! For dessert I had creme brulee which is my favorite. Overall, I'll be back every week that I'm in town."}
{"text":"Excellent steakhouse in the western suburbs of Cleveland. This literal cabin is worth the trip. An elite intimate dinner experience, you won't be disappointed here. The cabin in the woods motif is a nice departure from the chain and name brand restaurants in the surrounding area. The lobster bisque does live up to the award winning expectations!"}
{"text":"My fiancé surprised me on my 30th birthday by taking me to Cabin Club. He made reservations for 7 pm and we were seated pretty quickly. It was evident how nice everyone was and the ambiance of the restaurant was so calming and perfect for a birthday or any other type of celebration. It was also romantic. 

Our waitress, Leilani, was attentive and extremely nice. I am very picky when it comes to steak and she helped to steer me in the right direction. I ordered the Blackened Bleu Prime delMonico and it was INCREDIBLE. It was so good that I wish I never got full because even as I type this, my mouth is still watering. My fiancé was very happy with his meal as well. 

Jonathan, the manager, came over to see how everything was going and he was so nice and very down to Earth! It's so wonderful so see such good people working together. You can tell that everyone enjoys working there and that to me is a huge plus!

I realize I am rambling all over the place, but I have to mention the bread. They gave us a bread basket when we sat down and it was so warm and delightful. Yum.

They knew I was celebrating my birthday and that it was our first time there, so they surprised us with two desserts with a candle in each :-) It really made my day. We have already decided to go back for our next occasion! Thank you, Cabin Club, for making my birthday so special and memorable!"}
{"text":"Went to Cabin Clib for my birthday and it was delicious. We both had steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables. As a special treat they brought me a chocolate mousse for dessert, which was delicious. The building is cute and quaint with lots of wood."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here and we fell in love! We called to find out if they had a bar and the person on the phone answered all of our questions and also let us know happy hour was all day on Sunday! We we walked up to the hostess stand the hostess was polite and smiling and nice! She directed us to the bar where we were greeted by 2 very nice bartenders! They were knowledgeable with the menu and also let us take our time and look at everything! They joked and were very pleasant. The food was amazing! I ordered the surf and turf and my husband ordered the steak christofor. Everything was cooked to perfection! I literally was cutting my steak with a butter knife! I didn't realize I had the wrong knife until I was halfway through with my meal! This was overall a wonderful dining experience for us and hope to come back as often as possible. Natalie and the gentleman behind the bar made our date night dinner spectacular."}
{"text":"Had another really excellent mean here last week.  They have a nice menu option to pick out a steak (of various types) and get a salad and a vegetable with it.  They have a nice wine menu.  Good wines do not have to be expensive.   So look near the bottom of the price list and try some grapes you have never had.  For example, like Tempranillo which they had blended with other red grape, that was excellent and not too expensive.  The log cabin the restaurant is in is really cosy and still very elegant.  A nice location for social or business lunches or dinnners."}
{"text":"Great and fresh food (had filet mignon and asparagus), quick and friendly service, and warm atmosphere are the reasons for my 5 star rating.  They were very busy for 9pm on a Tuesday night so the locals love it.  The bar area is good for dining too.  TV's with Baseball playoffs were good for entertainment."}
{"text":"First time here. Excellent steaks. So far, the only place that does \"Pittsburgh style\" the right way in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The Cabin Club holds a dear place in my heart as it was the first restaurant I took my fiancé to when we started dating. I thought it would be nice to take her there for an early Valentine's day dinner, since we were both so impressed when we went 2 years ago. I called and made reservations 3 weeks in advance and only had the option of 4pm or 9pm or later. Note to all: MAKE A RESERVATION, especially on the weekend. We opted for the early dinner and went at 4pm last Saturday.
 
We were one of the first groups to arrive, since they open at 4pm and were seated at a small 2 person table, a tad disappointing since there were some booths available but we aren't too picky. The restaurant is enclosed in a cozy log cabin and has a small area of tables on one half (hence the reservation recommendation) and another side with a nice bar and a couple of TV's lined up as well. Our server was Genevieve for the evening. She was very personable and went over the Valentine's day specials.
 
We started with the \"special\" appetizer of the night, the mussels. Melissa is obsessed with mussels and they aren't particularly one of my favorites but these were divine. 15 mussels, one in every shell in a white wine garlic sauce was a fantastic start. Melissa had the apple salad next and I went with the customer favorite, the lobster bisque. People this bisque is no joke, I honestly would have been happy just getting another bowl of this for my meal it was that good. Even the drinks were fantastic, I went with the Shanghai Moscow Mule (with a tint of apple, simply perfect) and Melissa had a small cocktail and glass of Moscato that she very much enjoyed.
 
Our main entrée was the Steak Christopher, which is twin medallion filets over mashed potatoes with béarnaise, asparagus between 2 prawns of shrimp. Have to say, my steak was not cooked to how I asked but it didn't matter as it was perfect. The béarnaise sauce and mashed potatoes go amazingly with the cut of meat. My only gripe was that the shrimp weren't all that great but I guess not everything can be perfect.
 
I have to say that this is a top notch steak joint on the Cleveland west side. We had great service, food that was priced correctly for the serving size, and a wonderful ambiance in the restaurant itself. Take your lady here for a nice date, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for an impromptu dinner with my husband. Little did we know it was going to be such a wonderful date night! From the minute we walked in we were welcomed so sincerely! I felt like the manager and staff truly wanted to do everything they could to make sure we had a good experience! My husband was initially brought the wrong meal which included the lobster tail- his correct meal was brought out in minutes and he was offered to have the lobster tail as well. Both our meals were phenomenal! Great classic steakhouse food! We will be back for sure!! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere at cabin club. It is a small steakhouse so make sure you get a reservation before hand, because the food is so good the tables are usually taken up in the evening. I went there to celebrate my 30th birthday and I got the 7 ounce filet which is always cooked to perfection. They have an awesome deal where you can get a salad and side along with your steak. They usually have a salad on special that's not on the menu and I normally go with whatever they have on special because it is always amazing and has seasonal product. This salad had crisp apples walnuts and cranberries with a balsamic vinaigrette and blue cheese crumbles. Along with my steak I got the truffled cream corn which was so delicious. All of their steaks come with crispy onion straws which are seasoned. We also started with the sausage stuffed mushroom appetizer which is served with a tomato Ragu. Probably the best stuffed mushroom that I have ever eaten.  My significant other ordered what I believe was called the steak Christopher. It came with shrimp and asparagus as well as twin fillets. Because it was my birthday they also gave me a free dessert which was a chocolate mousse trifle with homemade whipped cream. No complaints from me, cabin club was amazing. Also the drink pictured is the mango and peach Bellini. A champagne drink with a hint of nectar. Super awesome birthday drink."}
{"text":"Nice higher end steak and seafood.  Have had many great meals here and if you are looking for a good steak you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Great cozy cabin atmosphere. The lobster bisque was thick and creamy with great flavor and large portions. I ordered the Filet ala carte with a loaded baked potato and my friend ordered Steak Christopher. Both steaks were cooked perfectly. And the sides were terrific.
We had a great bottle of wine and a yummy chocolate mouse dessert.

The service was terrific from the minute we walked in to the minute we left."}
{"text":"When somebody asks me \"what is a good restaurant to go to around here\" I always respond Cabin Club! I can always count on the consistency of the service. Anytime we go there we get great service, good food and excellent atmosphere( especially in the winter). My personal favorite is the house steak salad, I get it almost every time we go there... The staff is attentive but not overbearing, and I, personally, like a small restaurant feel that they have. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had a gift card to use and thought a Friday lunch would be nice. 
We walked in, dressed in business casual+. 
Be very aware. This establishment is VERY much catered towards regulars. Which is great to see, albeit at the expense of guests like my wife and I who visited for our first time. We were placed at a table behind the bar and next to the exit door. There was no sign indicating it directly, but there could have been one pointing toward to door saying \"if you don't come here we don't want you here. Use this for to move on so we can serve people we want here.\"
There are numerous online reviews that share this same sentiment. I should have known. I felt judged from the moment we walked in. My wife and I have very good jobs and enjoy nice restaurants on a regular basis. We definitely felt a \"oh, these people are not one of us\" vibe. 
Food quality was excellent. I had the blackened scallops as an appetizer and it was honestly one of the best I have ever had. However the stark dish on the lunch menu was just ok. Really really small, and not overly impressive. If they pride themselves on steak, this didn't meet that standard. 
We were not offered a second drink or dessert. I guess they wanted to table opened up for a regular guest, or at least a spot to put the next guests that walk in that they would rather not serve. Mission accomplished."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Best dining experience of my life. So happy I went here for my birthday."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Halibut was the special. It was DRY. Rested in my stomach like rocks.  Their featured appetizers were deep fried. They were either over cooked or cooked in old oil. Whatever the case, it was equally as horrible as the halibut.  This was a second rate Applebee's meal at over the top prices. Never coming back. Their sister restaurants, Salmon Dave's and Blue Point leave a lot to be desired as well.  There's better restaurants in Cleveland    Don't bother with this place"}
{"text":"It's been about ten years since I last visited.  It remains one of the best.  The friendly and prompt service is an important factor that makes this place great.  Their ability to prepare the steak exceeds expectations.  The numerous side dishes accent the entrees whether they are steak or seafood.  The homemade desserts are delicious.  I had talked the Cabin Club up to my wife and her reaction was that I under sold it!"}
{"text":"Wow, Mac and cheese with spicy shrimp!
Steak u can cut with a fork, awesome place best Cleveland area has to offer I'm thinking."}
{"text":"This is the first review - this is just wrong?

Cabin Club is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Maybe that is because it was the first good restaurant I went to when I moved there and my wife and family have been there many times. My brother-in-law especially likes the restaurant.

This is a restaurant that knows what it does well and does only that. You might think the menu is limited and you'd be right and don't go if you are vegan. This place does steak, steak and more steak. Yes, they have seafood, pork chops and maybe a veal dish, but steak is where it's at and what you need to order.

My appetizer favorites are the fried calamari, blackened scallops and last, but not least, the best lobster bisque you can find in Ohio. Salads are excellent as well.

Hands down, the best steakhouse in the Cleveland area. Just try the Strip Steak - blackened with bleu cheese or with peppercorn glaze. Or the Steak Christopher. Excellent!!! Let me say it again - the best steakhouse in the Cleveland area - probably in the whole state of Ohio.

Reservations are practically mandatory as the place is quite small. I went in one night with a co-worker without reservations and we had to wait at the bar for an hour - in itself not a bad place to be since the drinks are large and strong.

One of the best things about the Cabin Club is the fact that the same wait staff was there after we had been going for 4 years. Always a good sign.

Bottom line, go to the Cabin club and write a review so more people can enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been in here in a few years, but my husband and I decided to go for the Tuesday lunch special--chicken paprikash. 

We arrived around 12:30 and to our surprise it was a full house. We had to sit at the bar which was no biggy. 

We were promptly acknowledged and ordered our meals. The wait was reasonable seeing how crowded the place was. We both ordered the paprikash.  Our salads came out and were just the right size to go with the hearty meal we ordered, house dressing was very good. 

Presentation was the best I have seen for paprikash with the dumplings piled in the middle swimming in the rich sauce with plenty of white meat chicken.   Some of the best, if not the best, paprikash I have encountered. 

My only complaint, if any, is that we had to sit at the bar and almost felt like we were intruding on the regulars who must come often for lunch.  Reason for four stars instead of five."}
