{"text":"This all day breakfast and steak place is located near the main runway at Pearson on Airport Road south of Derry Road. There is lots of parking and the space is quite large. They have a wide selection of quick steak meals as well as burgers, fries, and other grilled or deep fried foods. I had a steak on a bun and although the taste was OK, the steak soaked the bun making it difficult to eat with a knife and fork. However, the overall quality was OK.  My issue with this place is the cleanliness or lack of it. The place seemed dirty with many tables still holding used plates with old food. I don't understand why that needs to be that way since the place had 3 people in there when I walked in.  I had to search for a table as far away from one that had old food and plates on it. The washroom is disgustingly dirty and I can't understand why restaurants don't pay more attention to this area.  It's amazing how effective a fresh coat of paint and some clean washrooms can be in gaining loyalty from repeat customers. Until this place cleans up, I would never go back there. Zets offers similar food in a slightly cleaner environment and Zets Express is even cleaner."}
{"text":"Breakfast is always good here!  It's got that old diner look but friendly service and good food.  Not expense and good size portions."}
{"text":"The place is a replica of Zets breakfast. I ordered the chicken souvlaki which included rice and salad. The salad was not romaine lettuce, but regular lettuce, the chicken was bland, the restaurant was not busy at all."}
