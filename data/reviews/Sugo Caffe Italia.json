{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a date night here on Friday night and it was really awesome! The food and service were both excellent. We were really interested in the braised short rib ravioli but decided on two other dishes, as a surprise the waiter brought us some tasters or the ravioli!! So thoughtful (and delish!), really happy we chose this spot for our date night, can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I'm a little bummed, not going to lie. I made a mistake ordering bruschetta and thought I was ordering what I had seen on the online menu but it was different on the printed ones... Ended up getting chicken heart instead of cannelini... My bad. Then the bartender or kitchen mixed up my pasta order and I ended up with the special instead of the lobster and egg noddles I was so excited about. They were slammed. Service was slow. But they comped by meal and 10% which was the right way to handle it. Drinks were great."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and am constantly happy with my experience.  The decor is beautifully done and the food is as one should expect when you are paying around $30 a meal.  The only thing that I would question is the service.  The waitress could be a little more welcoming."}
{"text":"Good food once it came.  We were there for Friday lunch at 12:30, although it was about half full, the food took over 45 mins after ordering.  There seemed to be only one waitress on to cover both sides of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Our party of four walked in and were the only ones in the restaurant on a Wednesday night.  It's very cosy and dimly lit, great for a dinner date. Our server was fantastic. He joked with us and paid just the right amount of attention to our table. We were given bread ( courtesy of Wilde Grainz next door) along with the most delicious whipped herb butter to slather on. I had the linguini with clams. My bowl came and the portion size was gigantic. They were generous with the clams, and the sauce was so simple but perfect. While paying $18 for a bowl of pasta sounds crazy to some, Sugo definitely takes it to the next level."}
{"text":"My girlfriend was away for a week and when she got back I wanted to take her out for a nice dinner. I had not heard of Sugo prior to this experience, but I was in high hopes due to some great reviews. Finding parking on a weekend in Inglewood is probably a nightmare, but fortunately I made reservations on a Wednesday night and found a spot directly in front of the restaurant. We started off with the Caprese Salad, which was very tasty when comparing it to others we've had in the past. Our server then brought out the complementary bread and spread. I gotta say that the garlic and honey butter spread that came out with the free bread was amazing lol. Our only slight disappointment of the night was the time in between getting the bread and the mains, which was probably heightened by the fact that we were starving. My girlfriend ordered \"Fresh Fettuccini with a braised chicken leg\" which was tasty. As for me, I ordered \"Grilled Pura Vida Chicken breast with Prosciutto and mozzarella stuffing\". I was also craving risotto at the time so I asked our waitress \"Lindsay\" if she could serve the chicken on a bed of risotto. She was nice enough to go to the kitchen to let them know of my request and that's exactly what they did! The chicken had a great char on the outside and was still very juicy on the inside and the bed of risotto that it was served on was amazing. We finished the night off with some tea and their Nutella Cream Puffs (which wasn't a highlight at all), but overall the service was great and the mains were flavourful! Sugo's menu changes on a nightly basis so we will probably be back to try some new foods!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Love the atmosphere. Found out that there's a new menu everyday. Staff was great at helping pick and choose menu items. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner this past week.. Food was great and service was outstanding !  Nice ambiance and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I've been to Sugo plenty.  I have to say that I haven't had a bad meal there but over the last 2 years or so the food hasn't blown me away like it did 6-8 years ago."}
{"text":"We headed here for a late dinner (8ish) for a friends birthday. Waiting for the dinner crowd to clear out so they could set our table for 6 people, they offered us some champagne for our patience (score!) We were seated at a round table at the back of the restaurant near the kitchen (the venue is VERY narrow) so it felt a bit cramped having the wait staff maneuver around us throughout the night. Other than that, everything was fantastic. We noshed on the house bread with their amazing house made garlic spread as we waited for our calamari to arrive (be warned it's not breaded!)  Their menu is changed daily so I couldn't look at the menu prior to coming in, it took me a little bit longer to decide what I wanted (I went with the linguine with clams in a white wine sauce as did the bday girl), and our friends went with the orecchiette with boar bacon& mushroom, gnocchi with beef ragu and lamb sirloin with rosemary red wine jus.  Although the portions were small, all the meals were big with flavour! (And yes I got to have a taste of everyone's :)) I'm glad I went with the linguine; it was my fave of all the dishes."}
{"text":"First time visit. And the last.  Made a reservation and indicated it was a special occasion. Even ordered flowers and asked they be on the table when we arrived. No flowers (had to ask) and we were placed at a table for six in the bar area with cold air rushing in every time the door opened (and we ended up sharing the table... Romantic.)    Food was quite good and the service was acceptable. This, however, is the first restaurant I've ever been to CHARGED FOR TAP WATER. They call it \"Q\" water, but all it is is filtered tap water. (Granted, it is indicated in tiny, tiny print at the bottom of the menu, but if they're going to charge you for water, at least have a carafe on the table, and some ice cubes. As it stands, we were each changed for a glass of tepid Calgary tap water.)  NEVER going back and will discourage everyone I know from going."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday with one other person. The restaurant was pretty full, we were greeted quickly and walked to our table. However, we sat there for a good while before anyone gave us menus. Then we got the menus however the server did not go over any specials and kind of seemed like he was in a hurry to get away from the table (which happened all night).   When he came back we ordered drinks and appetizers. The drinks took forever to come and actually arrived after the appetizers. I had a sangria that was decent, but a little watered down. We had the bruschetta and arancini for appetizers which were mediocre. The risotto balls lacked flavour. The spaghetti carbonara was a good pasta and very filling and flavourful. My date had the tagliatelle with braised rabbit and it was very tasty as well. On to dessert which was the chocolate almond cake with gelato on top. It sounded better than it tasted and left much to be desired.  I would maybe go back just for the pasta but there are so many other great spots in Calgary that I doubt I'd choose Sugo again. Good pasta, mediocre everything else."}
{"text":"Service is slow and a very noisy environment. Mains were generally good but accompanying veg and potatoes were meager. Check your bill, 2 mistakes on ours. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Wow!! I was absolutely blown away by Sugo! Get the Peasants Dinner, even better with wine parings. This may have been my best dining experience in Calgary, ever."}
{"text":"Try the handmade pasta.  This is a great place.  Good ambience and terrific food.  The wait staff is knowledgable and professional.   You can also bring your own wine.   The menu changes often so there is always something new.   You need to try Sugo.  You won't be sorry.     Lots of parking close by."}
{"text":"We have an annual Christmas lunch with the girls on my floor at work.  We try to go to a new restaurant every year.  This year we wanted Italian and I had heard great things about Sugo so we decided to give it a try.    I understand what other reviewers have said about the waitress...she's not overly friendly.  She was helpful enough, though, when we asked for help determining entrees and appetizers.    Overall, everyone was very happy with their meals.  The only dish I was slightly disappointed with was the chicken/arugula/goat cheese flatbread.  The creme brulee made up for it, though, as it was one of the best creme brulees I've ever had."}
{"text":"i wanted to like sugo! it has cool decor and looks so appealing from the outside. but the fact that it's empty at lunch hour on a wednesday while other places in inglewood are full is consistent with my experience. i was there on a long lunch recently and we were the only customers there the entire time. the service was good although the coffee came a bit slow. i had the pear/prosciutto flatbread which was way too salty/balsamic-y and gave me NASTY heartburn for the rest of the day. sad face.  i'll stick with spolumbos next time."}
{"text":"Really nice place for a date. Food was really simple but good. The place has a quaint feel to it and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Two words. Pistachio Creme Brulee. (ok, maybe that was three)  We dropped in one night for a quick bite. It will definitely be on my list of \"must return to\" restaurants. We were seated very quickly, even though we didn't have a reservation and the place was full.  I'm not a foodie, so all I know is the food was great - the best part was dessert. So glad I went with the waiters suggestion for the creme brulee. It was AMAZING. I'd go back for that alone."}
{"text":"3 stars Max. Service here just downright sucks, plain and simple. Sat night, resos for 4 and we walk in, no greeting at all. We walked around to find our friends until a hostess looked at us like we were nuts. Reso found, we were seated. Waitress should not be in the service industry. She was the only one on the floor for a near full restaurant all night and this is what lingers when we think of Sugo. The food was ok, nothing mind blowing and I was disappointed that there were no decent pastas on the menu. I do like that the menu supposedly changes daily but they are recycled so we got other people's oil drippings on the paper menus from the day\"s lunch crowd. 2 of us got the halibut. Very pretty plate, a healthy option with all the steamed veg but the fish was very dry. I do recommend the scallops as an appy. Pricey for 3 on the plate but cooked to perfection. You have to ask for the pepper mill and you will wait for it. The tiramisu - do not bother. It was served in a wine glass and it did not justify the price. My husband said it just tasted like leftover cake with whipped cream on it. The food also took forever to get to us, all courses. Had we ordered coffee I am sure we would be sitting there until Monday! Our food was cold too so who knows how long it sat at the pass. The restaurant itself is very nice inside, it was dim and moody, like our server.  Good thing our friends were excellent company or this would have been an expensive bust! Cleanliness - check. We gave this place a shot, will not be back just due to service or lack thereof.   Atmosphere - 4 Food - 3 (not consistent)(and they ran out of Peroni beer) Service - 0.5  No splitting cheques either, you will see a disclaimer on the bottom of the menu page (so odd!) and you will pay a buck a person for bread and tap water. (no ice or lemons offered and we did not dare ask for any!!)"}
{"text":"This place is over rated on food and service. I took my family to celebrate my wifes birthday and the server was out rude and not intrested in providing service. He didn't offer wine list or menu, no bread nor any courtesy. The food was average Not going to this place ever again"}
{"text":"wow! my first time here this evening, and what a superb meal.  My friend suggested it and shared that it has been kicking around a good 15 years i. Calgary.  No idea how I missed it.  For the two of us, we had one drink, a salad as an appetizer and a main, and the tab was $70 each, which included the 20% tip we left our deserving waiter.  The salad I had was their beet salad which was very unique from my perspective. instead of chunks of beats, it was beats that were shaved into thin chips.  delicious!  Heather got the pan seared snapper as a main, and I got the short ribs. so delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent .  The only issue I had was that  my egg on my spaghetti carbonara was well done. The waitress offered to send it back , but then the rest of my dish would have gotten cold.  Really , when you realize the yolk was hard as a rock, would it have killed you to make a new egg? The yolk should be soft and runny, to ooze into the rest if the dish .  Total laziness on the cooks part, and it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Ended up having dinner at Sugo this past weekend because of the reviews and honestly wasn't impressed. The restaurant is cute (dim and cozy) and service was good but the food just wasn't that great. We started off with some cheese, olives, and bread. The butter was actually really good. Whipped and slightly sweet. We got the Caesar salad as well since our server raved about it. A bit of a let down since nothing about it stood out except for the presentation. We ended up choosing three pasta dishes to share family style. The shrimp fettuccine, bolognese, and the pappardelle. Again, nothing stood out about these dishes and flavors was very muted. Ended dinner w cheesecake and tiramisu. Overall just a very overpriced and underwhelming meal."}
{"text":"Came by on a Friday evening and while the food was very enjoyable, the service was horrible. She asked for our order and then walked away to seat a couple that just came in without even saying she'd be back. We felt like we were just inconveniencing her with any request and felt like she couldn't wait for us to be done and gone.  As for the food, the carbonara was quite salty, would've been nice to have butter or olive oil with our bread. The charcuterie appetizer was tasty with an impressive selection of meat and cheese. Overall, we did enjoy the freshness and taste of the dishes but doubt we will be back due to the poor service."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Sugo Caffe Italia   Date of Visit: Tuesday, December 30, 2014  Restaurant was busy but not full. 1 bartender and 2 servers, I think they needed another server present. Our waiter was nice and friendly but didn't make our table of 4's visit \"WOW!\" There were times we wanted to ask questions or order, and he was basically running around attending to his other tables, which is understandable.  Our table decided to do the Chef's Testing of 4 course for $69 per person. Our meal included a Smoked Oyster + Marinated Heirloom Beet Salad with Bitter Greens and Ricotta Salata + Michelangelo's Homemade Gnocchi with Mushrooms + Slow Roasted Magret Duck Breast with Orange & Anise Sauce + White Chocolate Creme Burlee with Olive Oil Shortbread. The meal was delicious but in my opinion, the portions was not worth the $69. Each course intervals was also quite long.  Tip(s): My favourite dish was the Slow Roasted Magret Duck Breast with Orange & Anise Sauce. Must try if you like duck.  Would I recommend Sugo to others, YES! Would I come back to Sugo, maybe... I feel like this restaurant will not make me \"run\" back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I recently answered a job offer on Craigslist which stated \"In the chaos of unpacked boxes you orchestrate a home masterpiece!\" which I quickly answered and got.  Basically I curated this woman's art, sacred objects and artifacts collection and needless to say it was a very memorable week working in what you can imagine to be a very eclectic home.  When the job finished my client invited the crew and I to a celebration dinner which brought us to a restaurant in Inglewood on 9th avenue S.E. called Sugo Caffe Italia.  Just sitting outside Sugo I felt underdressed and so did my co-workers but our appetites and curiosity managed to find our way into the restaurant where our reservation of 6 was warmly greeted by the staff.  The decor in this restaurant is exquisite, simple and clean with accents of contemporary earthy art pieces on warm muted walls.  Jarred tomatoes and jams are illuminated upwards with mini lights shining brightly from beneath them and antique chandeliers hang above dripping with crystal raindrops and lined pearl beads.  There is no corner that has not been thought out decoration wise here and the table settings are complete with artisan ceramics and fine crystal glassware.  An average meal is between 20 to 40 dollars but once you savour the many dishes on a menu that changes every evening and the many cheese options that I couldn't pronounce you are completely titillated.  Every meal's presentation has been evoked with an artist's touch and the freshest ingredients are presented in front of you to tantalize your palate.  I was extremely impressed by an ample Scotch list, over 15 choices and the huge portions of deserts that were presented in the most elegant formations that look like one could almost wear them as head pieces.  I was so impressed by Sugo the first time that I took my partner there to have our own celebration dinner the very next evening.  Absolutely 5 stars without a question."}
{"text":"My mom and I were going to an event Friday night, and wanted a nice bite to eat beforehand somewhere close. A quick Yelp search brought up Sugo, so we gave it a shot. Given that it was early evening, the place was pretty dead when we arrived but by the time we were left it had picked up quite a bit! The space is gorgeous, although the floors are not exactly heel-friendly (almost took a spill walking to & from the bathroom!).  We were seated and had a very cute waiter, who I think might have been new, given the quality of service we received. The menu changes slightly everyday, which I sort of like, because everything was so fresh. What I don't like is their little disclaimer on the bottom of the menu re: splitting the bill. I completely understand that policy, but didn't like the way it was worded. Found that quite rude, and will keep that in mind for group dinners.   We ordered a small cheese plate to start, one of which was recommended by said cute waiter, and I was very impressed because it was exactly the kind of cheese I wanted! It came with a nice side of pickled veggies (but no pickles - odd) and a little bit of duck breast. We also ordered oysters, which were good, but not the best I've had. I had the Spaghetti with Prawns & Clams and my mom had the Gnocchi with Veal Medallion. Both of our entrees were absolutely delicious! We found them to be somewhat small portions, but I was glad for that, because we were just SO full after the appies and cheese (not to mention the bread that comes with the table, mmm!).  We skipped the dessert because we were stuffed, although I wish I hadn't - seeing as how I love creme brulee - and it's mentioned in previous reviews!  It was a very nice experience, even though our waiter did tend to 'forget' about us on occasion, and it is on the pricey side. I also wasn't a big fan of the bathroom - it seems trivial but the hallway where it's located was dark and there was no signage - making for an awkward trip to the girls room. All in all, it was a good experience, but I'm not sure it's one I would rush back for."}
{"text":"This place was ok. Good service, and the food was good too. I really enjoyed the Pistacchio Creme brulee.. It was very good... Even when is not my favorite italian restaurant in Calgary. I would go back there."}
{"text":"We had the 5 course chef's tasting. Some interesting items that were not on the daily menu. Quality was high. Value was moderate, however. And the meal was very slow. Now, while I agree that one should not rush a meal, we did seem to wait for quite long periods between courses. OMG, we had to talk to each other... just kiddn."}
{"text":"Wow! What a gem. Great people. Amazing food. A nice lunch. We'll be back. The Fiore di latte was incredible. The saffron infused pasta was so good. Go. Eat. You're welcome. Update: This quaint bistro has since closed."}
{"text":"Small and quaint with large taste..I am glad to have finally tried this Inglewood favorite.  I have known of Sugo since moving to Calgary 7 years ago - and for some reason, just never made it there - until last night. It was \"girls\" night out for our annual Christmas gift exchange and drinks (and food), so we choose Sugo as three out of four of us have never been (and I could use a new place to Yelp).  I won't lie - the start was poor. Our reso for 7:00 was confirmed but we were sat at the bar while they \"made the table\"....45 minutes later - we got a table. Umm.. say what? What was also weird, was that other tables remained empty the full time. Being a restaurant snob (ok, not snob - but expectations are in place), I felt that was too long when we had a reservation. Oh well, we gabbed, drank free Prosecco and then went to our table.  Our waiter was a delightful chap who was definitely enterprising and very attentive - so service was A+. We all decided on the Chefs 5 course tasting (cause when you are hungry it's clearly a great idea to eat as many courses as possible) and ordered a yummy bottle of wine. The food started arriving.  Course #1 - Shrimp and a small salad - not bad; Course #2 - Homemade mozza, peppers and reduction - AMAZING AND FRESH; Course #3 - Gnocchi and a awesome ragu - very impressed; Course #4 - (by this time we worried we might go home hungry) - but out came 6-7 lamb popsicles, veggies and a reduction - quite well done and quite enjoyable. Course #5 - DELLLIICCIOUSSSS PANNA COTTA (yea.. I like my desserts). Likely one of the best Panna Cottas EVER!!! I ate two :).. so creamy, berries on-top and a couple sauces to spoon up with each bite. heavenly.  So by now, I was full. A fantastically well rounded, tasty and nicely served tasting. I enjoyed my evening and was there until 11:30 chatting to which they never rushed us out at all. I enjoyed the food, ambiance and service quite a bit - so much, i forget the waiting at the start.  I look forward to returning to try some of the pastas I saw on the menu as well as their \"create a board of appies\" that I saw on a menu as well....  Until we meet again Sugo..."}
