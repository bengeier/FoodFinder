{"text":"The food is as lip numbing, spicy and greasy as Szechuan food should be and we thoroughly enjoyed indulging in the above mentioned threesome. A nice casual lunch spot in Midtown Manhanttan, that's always bustling with people, mostly Asians! That's a good sign, what? The waiter could speak good English and we had no trouble in communicating our vegetarian, no meat instructions. The decor is plain. Well, I was looking for a quick lunch and didn't care too much about the decor. For starters we got the Steamed Vegetable Dumplings. Very tasty! Steamed vegetable dumplings @ Szechuan Gourmet Spicy spring bamboo shoots - Whoa! Watch out for this one. Very spicy. Very very spicy. It is eaten cold like a salad. The seasame oil, ginger, soy sauce and other spices impart such great flavor."}
{"text":"The service is terrible!!! We did not have any utensil, napkins, tea, or menu. I had to go and ask them multiple times to get these. Furthermore, they never came to refill the tea, when we asked them to bring spoons, they told us they didn't want to walk all the way across the restaurant to come and serve us. It is absolutely ridiculous!!! The worst of all, they charged us automatically 13% on the bill!!! I've been to lots of Chinese restaurant, the service for this one is by far the worst!!!"}
{"text":"More than 3/4 dishes in the menu are spicy and flaming hot dishes. I'm not a masochist in for such a food torture. However, curiosity pull me in to give it a chance. The beef pie ( not spicy nor flaming hot ) was delicious. The fish I ordered was a little mouth burning hot even my tummy seems burning for hours after that, but I just couldn't resist the way it done that my brain kept signalling it wants more. Also, the wonton soup's interestingly different than all other Chinese or Korean I tasted so far. It just different and big, very delicious indeed."}
{"text":"Hit and miss, food are very flavourful, lamb skewers ???, cold noodles ??, sometimes good, other times, they out too much salt, too much sesame oil, the preserved vegetable fish stew was a DISASTERS, the vegetables ?? had no flavour, it was borderlining gross. Hot sizzle pot ??was good, but I suspect they use packaged flavouring because I had same package before"}
{"text":"3.5 Been there twice so far. The first time, I went with a friend. Service was very friendly and attentive at first, but I guess we stayed for a bit too long (not unreasonably long though, and the restaurant wasn't busy at all at the time), the waiters pretty much just ignored us from there on. However, food quality/portion/pricing were decent. I went back for takeouts a few nights ago, and was pleasantly surprised that they didn't skimp on the meat (had that experience a lot with other restaurants), and both dishes were very tasty."}
{"text":"Stopped by after reading good reviews.  Had the braised beef soup.  The noodles were fresh, but the soup itself seemed to be lacking flavour.  I would return, but I'd try another dish."}
{"text":"Anne's magic kitchen specializes in Northern Chinese cuisine.  Have been here a few times and overall I like what I had so far.  Braise beef noodle soup has flavour but obvious lack the depth of what I had had in Taiwan. Lamb kebab and grilled fried tofu are my favours.  Lamb kebab tends to be slightly overseasoned but since I like spicy, it tailors to my taste.  Grilled fried tofu on the other hand is yummy with slight crisp skin while preserving the silky, soft texture inside.  Also tried one of their signature beef pancake, it tastes ok but I personally don't like this, as I find it too dry to eat it in the summer.  They also make decent bubble tea and I really like Hokkaido milk tea, it tastes smooth, creamy and quite refreshing. But I find bubble tea overpriced in comparison to their food.  

The service here is alright, sometimes they take your order and pretty much disappear to run other errands.  One positive note is that the food has consistently come out of kitchen boiling hot during my visits.  Overall it's a decent eat in that area."}
{"text":"My first visit was relatively pleasant. We ordered Beef noodle soup, Chive &pork dumplings and lamb skewers. Service was pleasant and quick. The food in general wasn't bad but not fantastic. The lamb skewers are tiny. It is however the only ok place to go for some northern Chinese food downtown. I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Visited here again and was disappointed with the braised beef noodle soup. The broth and beef lacked depth and flavour. I'm hoping this was a one off situation but felt the need to update my review in case it wasn't! Also ordered the lamb skewer that wasn't particularly hot or cold when it arrived at our table. Still tasted good though."}
{"text":"One of my go-to Chinese places! Came here when they first opened and have been a regular ever since. At first, I thought the English name \"Anne's Magic Kitchen\" was a bit sketch, but don't let the name fool you! 

We always order the ???? (fuqi feipian), beef noodles, stir fried lamb and boiling fish in oil as well as meat or noodle dishes depending on the season. Their food is consistently good with generous portions. Their noodles are also housemade and tastes amazing! 

Very affordable Chinese food and service is always friendly even when it gets busy. I always see the owner working hard in the kitchen and love coming here on a weeknight."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just ok- it's a mix of Chinese noodle and bubble tea shop. Portions are decent for its price so it will fill you up (probably what a lot of students are looking for) but the flavors are just not there. Noodles in their beef noodle soup were not chewy at all and quite doughy. Soup lacked flavor and the meat was pretty tough. Ordered beef in chili oil as well as beef pancake which I found to be pretty mediocre as well.. Next time I crave beef noodle I think I will just make the trip to uptown or stick to Japanese ramen.. or I think I rather go to Asian legend next door!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found this newly opened restaurant while walking down Dundas Street.  We were attracted to a number of the menu pictures on display outside so we decided to go inside to try it out.
Glad we did!

My wife is Chinese born and raised and at home prepares for me authentic cuisine 
This is kind of like what the food at Anne's reminds me of- home cooked genuine Chinese food prepared by someone who cares about you

There are hundreds of restaurants in Chinatown but we have yet to come across any with the regional dishes you will find here

The decor is modern and clean, the staff friendly and the food oh so good

I strongly recommend you treat yourself to dinner here!"}
{"text":"Food is very tasty with lots of options on the menu. The hot pots look very popular. The 3 dead fish in the fish tank and overalls upkeep and cleanliness will make me think about going back."}
{"text":"I've come here twice for lunch with people from work and each time was worse. The ingredients are low quality and they use way too much salt in all of their dishes.  The worst part is the cleanliness, we found a roach in one of our dishes half way through the meal."}
{"text":"Omg whyyyy - this place was my favourite why did it close can someone please advise... there is a shortage of authentic Szechuan restaurants in town and this was a hidden gem for me and my friends"}
{"text":"Reliable Szechuan eatery with boba and skewers on offer too. You need to ask them to make the food spicier to get a more authentic taste though. Recommended dishes: the cold appetizers like beef tripe and sliced flank (A101), mouth-watering chicken, boiled fish, lamb skewers or cumin beef, dan Dan noodles, beef noodles. They don't skimp on meat and since it's northern food, expect everything to come in a pool of chili oil. That's normal."}
{"text":"I follow the online search found this newly opened restaurant by accident with recommended dishes #901 handmade noodle soup, my wife got the chicken flavor, and my daughter ordered a wonton soup and the homemade bread. All dishes are big and delicious.

Better than many others in downtown Chinatown area."}
{"text":"What happened to their beef in spicy broth?! It used to be so good but now they put way too much tenderizer and has no flavour."}
{"text":"Excellent quality of foods. Their atmosphere is pleasant and clean. Washrooms likewise. Their staff is very polite but painstakingly slow. 
Anglophone communication can be difficult, but the excellent cuisine makes it worth the effort. 
Chongqing spicy BBQ fish is their 5 star specialty. Cooked fresh from live."}
{"text":"The food is fine.. However, going there for lunch today, the female waitress put in the tip she wanted in the machine herself. When she handed us the debit card machine, it asked for our debit card pin. We didn't realize this and put the pin in and the transaction went through.

I want to tell the owner this IS NOT OKAY. Firstly, tips are NOT MANDATORY. Secondly, what if you put some ridiculous amount in there. The female waitress said she put the lowest amount of tip in the machine. However, afterwards we calculated and this was not the case.  She had automatically chosen 15%. In such a case, I would have given NO tip because of this ridiculous and rude customer service. For others visiting this place, beware of this practice. Make sure you catch them in the act and tell them that this is wrong, immoral, and illegal. We didn't say anything because we were in the hurry. However, we have learned a lesson. Practices like this makes customers feel extremely uncomfortable. It makes a business seem untrustworthy and dirty."}
{"text":"Ordered Dan Dan noodles with chicken, and although the taste and spiciness lever were great and noodles were hand-drawn, the dish was extremely oily. Chicken in the dish is also cold (on purpose), just a heads-up if you decide to order it. The dish was huge though, so the price:amount ratio is reasonable.  
Hokkaido bubble tea was awesome though!"}
{"text":"I only recommend 1 thing from this place and that is their noodles. My favourite has to be the dan dan noodles. It's affordable at $6.99, decent portion, and most importantly tastes really good! Peanut chilli sauce is awesome. Their noodles seems fresh and have one of the best textures I've ever had from a Chinese place.

I had other dishes and they were just \"ok\". I don't recommend the lamb skewers. Very small and not as flavorful as other places I tried. I had their beef noodle soup and while the noodles are great, the beef and broth were so-so. I'm clearly sticking to their noodles from now on.

It's a Chinese place so don't expect much in terms of service. And they really need to reprint their sign outside. It's totally faded."}
{"text":"Delicious spicy Chinese lamb kebabs here! And tasty Presto tea bubble tea! The Szechuan food was good too."}
{"text":"It looked promising. It really did. 
But I was SO disappointed. 

Where do I start? I'm always down to get Northern Chinese food and a friend had recommended this place. Well, it wasn't good at all. Place wasn't packed but the food took forever to arrive. Our server never brought us our tea despite the fact that the 2 separate tables who were seated after us got their tea. Their response? We're out of tea. Um, ok. 

Food wasn't even tasty. Very subpar TBH. Ordered some spicy baos, a veggie dish, skewers, and a fish dish. It also was quite $$ given the food we received and how it tasted. This is a one-time thing, not going back because there are just too many restaurants on Dundas in Chinatown to give a chance."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Toronto, I've been visiting it a couple of times and still can't get enough. Not to mention the authentic bubble tea chain straight from Taiwan! And spicy brewed fish is the best, if you're there this is a go-to dish I'm sure it'll satisfy anyone(especially if you like spicy food)."}
{"text":"Really like their hand made noodle selection. 
Prices are a but on the expensive side but food is really good! 
The chongqing grilled fish (the only dish around $22) is amazing. You have the option of numb spicy, spicy and bbq. 
I order it every time when i go with a big group of people. (3+) we usually order spicy."}
{"text":"Came back again to get some takeout for my boyfriend and I. I was scared at first that the food wouldn't be as good because of the takeout but everything turned out amazing. 

I ordered three dishes: beef boiled in hot chilli oil, sautéed cauliflowers and Yu hsiang stir fried minced meat. The portions were very generous, I left with almost 1kg of takeout and the food was so so so flavourful! Every single dish was spot on for their seasoning, all with complex blends of spices and flavours pertaining to the dish. 

If you're going to take out, I highly suggest you take out only dishes and make rice at home. I might not seem like a lot but it can save you quite some money!"}
{"text":"2 of 3 dishes were too salty. The hot pot was mainly small pieces of bone with hardly any chicken on it and over fried fish.  The pictures on menu does not reflect what was served."}
{"text":"I get takeout here all the time, EXCELLENT food! Handmade noodles are a must. I also recommend the house special lamb - it was so good. I eat a lot of Chinese food, and when people ask for a recommendation, I send them here. I would suggest takeout (works well with the ritual app) because the decor isn't gorgeous... But the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant 4 times so far. In my experience, their service was never been good. Feb 11, 2018, would be the last visit to this restaurant. I came to the restaurant alone during dinner time and ordered Spicy Braised Beef with Noodle in soup and Deep Fried tofu with spicy sauce.  It was15.8 within tax. When I received the bill, I noticed that the waitress already added 10% for service charge without notice.  I asked the waitress why she added service charge without notify me in advance, she answered me \" Some customers would allowed her to do so without notice. \" Obvious I am not the one to let her do so. She retyped a bill, but she didn't want to change her amount setting on the machine. So I choose to pay by cash and didn't pay her tip. On the way out, she yelled in the air and said \" You haven't pay 10% for service charge yet. \" Despite of shitty service, Spicy Braised Beef with Noodle in soup and totu were my favorite dishes there. I like the tenderness of beef and chewy noodles, and crispy tofu. But I would l like to bring it up here, I didn't like their soup and sauce, it is always way too salty and always have a layer to \" non\" spicy red oil on the top. If you really like spicy food, you will be disappointed here."}
{"text":"I got the coconut bubble tea with the white and black tapioca pearls. I liked it, the milk tea itself reminded me of a rice pudding dessert and I thought it was fun having two different kinds of boba. Their cups are also really cute and the one I got was actually a medium so the large was huge. It's a cute little place and if you're looking for bubble tea this could be a nice stop."}
{"text":"Really really poor service. I've been looking for a new Northern Chinese restaurant ever since my old one closed down. I came here and what started promising turned into a 30 minute wait to get the attention of our server when it came time to acquire and pay the bill. They also gave us a singular take home box when I had three different dishes that were full of food....

The food was okay but nothing to rave about and after being ignored and forgotten about (I asked for my bill and they never brought it... so I had to ask for it again and then ask for boxes, and then more boxes hence the time fiasco, they seem more concerned with the bubble tea business in the front than what's going on in the actual restaurant), I'm going to pass on coming back."}
{"text":"This place is below average for Chinatown on food quality,
just average on dirtiness.  Avoid as there are definitely better places around."}
{"text":"Came here for the hand pulled noodles and cumin lamb. Got the small braised beef and noodle soup, and an order of lamb skewers. The skewers were tiny and spicy even though they weren't marked as spicy. The soup was a little spicy too and a decent size. I'd hit this place again if I was in the area and wanted something different, but I wouldn't go out of the way to go here."}
{"text":"Well you certainly don't see many Northern Chinese restaurants around China Town, so you're craving spicy food this is the place to be. The first two pages of the menu literally have 90% spicy food. 

I went with another friend and the two of us shared a plate of lamb skewers, chicken knee cap skewers, and fish in spicy food (a staple North Chinese dish). The lamb was too salty for me but my friend seemed to like it. The kneecaps actually weren't spicy at all. They were sweet so they probably used teriyaki sauce to make it. The fish was disappointing. After trying a spectacular Northern Chinese restaurant not too long ago this dish just doesn't hold up well against the other place. The fish was those frozen tilapia, not fresh fish. The flavor was average too, not enough variety of rich spices.

The bill ended up to be around $30 before tax so at least we didn't spend a lot of money at a rather average restaurant."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice. While one or two dishes were acceptable, on balance it just falls short of the mark. Two main concerns: not nearly enough heat even on The classic us to Schwan dishes; and too much of the spacing was just tired and dull. The Sichuan double cooked pork, and cold beef and tripe we're OK, just OK. Everything else disappointed, especially the Dan Dan noodles."}
{"text":"I like the homemade noodles in their spicy brisket soup. It's fresh and it's better than other places. I went there today but I just found out they closed down. It's sad to see it go. This is my must go place....."}
{"text":"Great, no-fuss food!

My friend and I shared the potstickers, steamed vegetarian dumplings, and the handpulled noodles with beef in spicy broth. The prices here are so affordable. The dumplings were much bigger than I expected but delicious. The potstickers in particular were juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside.

The place seems like it's owned and operated by a family, and the kitchen is semi-open so we actually got to watch one of the women making the noodles from scratch. What a nice touch -- and you can really tell when you eat the noodles too. I love the varying thicknesses of the noodle when they're handmade. The beef was tender and flavourful thanks to sitting in the broth, and the broth.............. SO yummy! Nice and spicy. I can't find the words to describe, but suffice to say I just ended up just dipping my dumplings in the noodle broth because I couldn't get enough of it.

Note: this place also has a bubble tea place, but I didn't try it. I was sufficiently confused upon entering, because I thought I'd walked into the wrong place. Just a word of warning. You are in the right spot!"}
{"text":"The tables are sticky, it was disgusting. I found a piece of hair in my dish, and a ladybug in my noodles. I think Toronto Public Health need to know this. The waiter made things even worse, he said(in Chinese) It is quite normal to get a ladybug, because there are vegetables in the noodle. It's so gross"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Their spicy lamb kebobs are awesome and very reasonably priced compared to other restaurants. Great selection of Szechuan food, especially the spicy dry hotpot dishes. Also love their handmade noodles. This place has become a new favorite for us!"}
{"text":"I would have given 1 star, but the fact that they had presto tea as part of their restaurant made pretty happy. 

the food is rather expensive, and not particularly delicious. the lamb skewers I got when I went were pretty tiny and mediocre-tasting. the tofu skin skewers were REALLY sweet some reason -- I don't think they're supposed to be sweet at all. 

I also ordered the big plate chicken (which was 16.99). it came with noodles which were handmade and chewy and delicious, but the \"chicken\" consisted of numerous scraps of chicken bone with little to no actual chicken attached. I wouldn't value the noodles in there to be 16.99 so it was a rip-off.

Also, their attentiveness was lacking, it could just be that they are newly opened and inexperienced, but it was definitely noticeable in the amount of time it took for them to bring some tea and ask if we were ready to order."}
{"text":"the noodle And pork buns is made fresh on the spot and the waitresses are really nice And helpful. the portion size is amazing. my friend and i definately had An awesome meal. price was really good And we had so much leftover to bring Home And enjoy it for later. highly recommend this place? :)"}
{"text":"This place is legit!! The noodles are exceptional, the broth is delectable, and the braised beef is a perfect balance between chewiness and tenderness. The place is extremely clean, inclusive of the kitchen. A small bowl of braised beef noodles knocks you back a mere $5.99 plus tax and gratuities-- a small price to pay in my opinion for those willing to take the risk of broadening their dining out repetoire! A grand culinary experience awaits you at Anne's Magic Kitchen."}
{"text":"Hot+Sour Soup had so many hits of flavour. Souper hearty nourishment for this winter chill weather. The dan dan noodles were authentically delicious and well seasoned, not excessively oily or overly sweet. The decor, atmosphere, and service were okay. I would be happy to return here and try other dishes as everyone's food looked good, but I would also be happy to just order the same thing again."}
{"text":"Was told by a good friend to come here for legit Asian food, and to ignore the 3.5 star rating on yelp. I was craving northern Chinese cuisine, and ordered 3 classics: eggplant/potato/pepper stir fry (too oily/saucy, as per usual in Chinese restaurants), spicy cumin lamb (great), and cold mung bean noodles (amazing sauce). Well priced too!"}
