{"text":"I've been a customer since they opened this past summer, and I can't get enough! The owners are a sweet older Indian couple who have had success in the restaurant bizz previously. They are from South India and boi do they know how to make some killer South Indian food (full disclosure, I am South Indian and have been searching for a good dosa place, and I had to search no further after finding this!). They also have a selection of other Indian foods, including the famous butter chicken. I can't recommend this place enough and would love to see it succeed. The only downside is sometimes the wait can be long because they are starting to get popular, and it is just them in the kitchen. Be patient and you will be rewarded with fresh, home cooked, delicious Indian food. If you don't believe me, check out the post on BlogTO http://www.blogto.com/restaurants/the-tiffin-box-toronto ."}
{"text":"I was so pleased to find this little Indian place!

If your looking for some low-key, delicious, cheap Indian food you've found the right place. It's my new go to. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I just love this little place - the food is awesome, and the family that owns it is kind and generous. It's suprising to me that there is relatively few places downtown where you can get South Indian food, so it's wonderful to have one so central, that is so satisfying.

I really appreciate that they have not just vegetarian, but also vegan options, as well as meat for when you're in mixed company. It makes it an convenient stop for a great meal when you're out with a group. Or heck, just by yourself!

I adore spicy food, and the first time I went and had the dosa it was really tasty, but didn't have any kick to it. I asked them if they had anything spicy, and their faces lit up and said they love to make spicy food, but only do it when requested. So if you like some kick, just let them know and they will make it happen! And MAN it is tasty!

The prices are all very fair, and everything is cooked to order. It's a great stop that I enjoy taking friends to!"}
{"text":"I live and work in the neighbourhood, and I'm so glad to have found a local spot that is affordable, fast, pleasant and delicious.  the vegetarian thali that I had today was delicious.  paneer texture so nice, and everything tasted so good.  I feel comfortable in this small, friendly place."}
{"text":"On vacation from Chicago and wanted a quick and inexpensive meal to grab for lunch. Stumbled upon The Tiffin Box. Authentic South Indian food - delicious! And friendly owners too. Tasted like Kerala dishes from my Mom's kitchen. So glad we made the stop. Minutes from Casa Loma. Dine in area is small and no table service. But the authentic dishes, friendly service and low prices is worth it!"}
{"text":"The granny is sweet. The curry is delicious. I hope we'd have it in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"It pains me to give the tiffin box only 3 stars since the couple who own/run the place are the nicest sweetest people you can meet. But truth be told their food leaves a lot of room for improvement. I ordered their non veg thali with butter chicken,veg avial ,methi paneer with rice. And my girlfriend had a dosa with curry chicken. Now I can say that their south Indian dishes like the avial and dosa were good however the other food was quite sub par in terms of taste and flavour. But the most worrying aspect was that all the chicken in both dishes had the texture of processed meat,like the kind in chicken nuggets. It's important to note that the tiffin  box is cheap but I think it's a raw deal to be served curried chicken nuggets. If I could rate the people it would be a solid 5 star but the taste of the food forces my hand to give the tiffin box a 3."}
{"text":"This is a husband and wife business and the couple are extremely friendly.  The food is served fresh - they make it in front of you just behind the counter you can see all the pots and trays.  Try the thali - either veggie or meat, and you'll get a combination tray with some rice, roti, a daal, a veggie curry and a meat dish all at a reasonable price and best of all fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"Great takeout or small dining spot, the amazing smell greets you when you walk in. I had the spinach dosa. It was very filling and tasty; I had so much leftover for lunch the next day. I really liked the tomato and onion chutney served with it. The samosas were great too. Looking forward to coming back and trying a curry!"}
{"text":"Excellent little spot and I'm so glad it's in my neighbourhood.  Very flavourful and healthy food.  Seems lighter than much Indian food I've had.  Has a home-made quality about it.  Nice to have this quick, healthy alternative."}
{"text":"The food was good and was authentic according to my limited knowledge. Also, the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This place is terrific.  Works best if you can take the food away, because there's not much seating.  I recommend the dosas."}
{"text":"Very small restaurant with limited seating. Very warm inside; windows are all steamed up inside; a fan was running inside on a cold winter day. Staff were very friendly; the kitchen in full view looks like someone's kitchen. I ordered lamb dosa and veg thali (combination plate) of avagil and palak paneer. Dosa was very good; I would also like plain dosa, but ones with filling seems more value for money. All curry dishes were very fresh; not too spicy or salty. I would feed my young children at this restaurant for this reason. I love thali, as it comes with dhal, raita, and...I don't remember the salad, actually. Price is very reasonable. Staff are very friendly. I feel like someone let me into their house in India and fed me some healthy, home cooked meal. I will return to this place for sure."}
{"text":"Definitely has potential to be a 5. Had some good buttered chicken, portion size could have been bigger for its price but still happy overall."}
{"text":"A good choice for indian food. Chicken curry was very yummy and the rice quality and flavor was par excellence. Reminded me of India. The chicken 65 was very average and needs to develop on flavors as it seemed like it is made only with red chilli powder. It was spicy and tangy which was enough to stimulate our retired taste buds having bland food in toronto. We will definitely want to try other things on their menu card especially the non veg thali that looks interesting.
Not a let down and you should try!"}
{"text":"This is a great little South Indian place. 

  I've ordered the dosas which I would recommend.   The dosas are large and pretty filling.  The food tastes fresh and doesn't have a lot of oil added to it which keeps it healthy.  

As the previous reviews have mentioned the prices are very reasonable.

The owners are a super friendly older couple.   I am really rooting for this place."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch two months ago out of curiosity. The food was just okay, nothing to be raved about to be honest. However the couple who run the place are so sweet and lovely and provided great service."}
{"text":"Just opened, (June 2014), this small Indian diner has simple homemade food.

No item costs more than $10 and is good value. 

On the recently expanded menu are such items as: Mulligatawny soup, bowls of meat,(Lamb,Chicken), or vegetarian combinations on rice, Curry, Dosas ( Indian style crepes),  and salads. 

(It is amusing to see the Dominoes Pizza staff from next door, coming in to buy their food here!)

Hours: 11.00am to 9.00 pm"}
{"text":"Very authentic feel and amazing cheap Indian food. This is not a place you go if you want a quick bite but if your happy to hang out, have a chai and sit down to a home cooked meal, then this is the place for you! It's a new local favourite of mine."}
{"text":"I haven't had such a perfect blend of spices from any south E. Indian restaurant in Toronto. Place is small and clean. If memory serves me right, all meals are under $10. 

I ordered a Chicken Dosa, Channa Chaat (chick peas salad) and veggie samosa. Dosa and Chana Chat were both A+. Samosa filling was delicious, not a fan of their samosa wrapping though.

It is fair to say that I'll be going back, over and over again."}
{"text":"We've been to the College St. location 3 or 4 times and have never been disappointed. The food is really fresh, and everything is shockingly good. We've probably sampled 70% of the menu and have liked everything. The pakoras are unlike any I've had before... a must try! Also, the owner is really nice and friendly. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I love the Tiffin Box! The owners are so cute and the food is delicious! I go there so often they know me now...can't stay away! Prices are very reasonable for the serving sizes (usually lasts me 2 meals)."}
{"text":"Nice homely place! The owners are very sweet. The food is all under $10 and you walk away full . I'll be back soon for sure"}
{"text":"College Street Location Review: 
We work at the bank down the street, not only is the store owner so damn nice, he goes over and above when helping us. We pre-order our meals and he always has it ready for us on time. You walk in and its so clean, you can tell its all fresh and we prepares what he can on the spot. You taste the difference. The veggie samosas are on point too! Lastly the price is the best, we do the curry poutine for $5 and a side of samosas which are $2 for 2. Sometimes we change it up for the curry bowls or the butter chicken bowls for $8 lunch special that's awesome too! Oh and if you like spice make sure to ask him as he will make sure its perfect you! Couldn't recommend this spot more. YAY!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful little place! Super sweet ladies running the place and cooking. Butternut squash dosa is excellent. Dosa itself expertly and beautifully made, perfectly and evenly crisped. Limited seating and not a table service establishment. Definitely a must return!"}
{"text":"I like the stuff here. I am not sure why I can't bring myself to give them a 5 star review but maybe I do feel they can do better. Everything was somewhat flavourful, tasty and fresh. Everything had a homey vibe to it which I dig. Nan was good, curry decent, rice great! The dude behind the counter was very friendly and it's a self serve kinda joint. Prices are cheap okay but a little expensive for the equivalent of Indian food court food. Overall, still pretty good."}
{"text":"Good food for a good price. 

Although the consistency and taste of the food varies I still like to order from here. I normally get the butter chicken or vindaloo. I always do pick up, however they have been forgetting to add the yoghurt recently.

It it's in your area defiantly try it out however if it's out of the way I wouldn't recommend making the trek over."}
{"text":"After moving to Toronto from Vancouver, we had been searching for dosas like we used to get out west. After a few different tries we discovered The Tiffin Box right around the corner from our home. While it's not a huge menu, I think it's a good thing as everything we've tasted has been delicious. The prices are also very reasonable, especially for the quality that you get. 

If you're in the Bathurst / Bloor area and have a hankering for quality South Indian food, The Tiffin Box is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"College Street Location: Friendly and kind owner and son (I believe).  I only wish the best for them!  However, I have had better butter chicken in many other places before.  Definitely not the flavours of the regular butter chicken I am used to.  It has a good taste but definitely not butter chicken.  I will have to try a different dish next time so going to give this place one more try.   I will return with another review some other time.

I ordered the dinner and just realized at this moment while I am typing that I didn't even get a Pakora?!?!  I got a butter chicken on rice and a side of raita for $12.00.  Not bad price for a big portion but I was refused a parkora :( LOL  I will bring it up to them.  all these reviews about how good the parkora is and I can't comment :o"}
{"text":"We decided to give this Indian take-out place a whirl, as it was just down the street and seemed convenient. Most reviews indicated it was cheap, with good portions. We ordered a few items, and butter chicken was one of them - as this is typically a staple in most Indian restaurants in North America.... and I have to say, I was sadly disappointed. The sauce actually tasted like watered-down Campbell's tomato soup. Seriously.
The pricing was certainly cheap, I'll admit that.... but the quality of the food left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Tasty and healthy food.  Nice courteous service. Very reasonable prices. Highly recommend the vegetarian thali. Nice older Indian couple runs the joint."}
{"text":"Located in a small square box north of Bloor and South of Dupont it has floor to ceiling windows looking east onto Bathurst Street. There is a small open kitchen off to one side in the back where the owners, an older East-Indian couple frantically work to fill all the orders. Everything in the place is kind of ad-hoc including the kitchen and you can tell that while the couple create amazing food that they have no idea how to run a restaurant. In front of the hobbled together kitchen are a few tables and seats facing the windows. When we arrived the place was packed and sadly there was always a scramble for seats when someone finished and left.  You place your order at the counter and then wait for it to be finished. The food when done, which features a selection of East Indian dishes, curries, Thali and a selection of Dhosas, was delicious. They are attentive to dietary restrictions offering vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options. Sadly, the scramble for seats and the ad hoc method of ordering creates a dining experience that is less than pleasant. We ate with people standing over us waiting for us to vacate. While the couple know how to cook sadly they need some pointers on how to run a restaurant. Without attention to the details I fear the place may not last long. They really needs someone to streamline the place and give them a bit of polish, including a more professional kitchen, a better system for placing orders, better use of the space and more seating. Then I am sure they could grow and become a great success."}
{"text":"Well spiced and well priced. This little mom and pop shop is worth a visit. Has a similar vibe to mystic muffin, you feel like your in a friends kitchen in a way. My only comment would be there should be more chicken in the butter chicken to make sure people are really getting there money's worth. I'll definitely be back!"}
