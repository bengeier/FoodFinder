{"text":"Fast, good service, and clean, but the sandwich was underwhelming. Someone else mentioned that it appears to be a grocery store bun and I'd agree. They really need to step up their game to compete with Cumbrae's, California Sandwiches, and Sud Forno. Price-wise, they are cheap which might have a market in the area and I suspect once you end up paying for all the extras that generally come free, or aren't required on the other place's sandwiches, that might be a false economy."}
{"text":"Great made to order sandwiches. Extremely friendly service at the cash and from the kitchen.  I eat here once a week."}
{"text":"Italian sandwich shop new to Queen West!!
Veal, chicken, meatball, steak. Comparable to California sandwiches just 2 blocks away! Much better in my opinion. Consistently good!! Check it out. New to downtown but other locations already going."}
{"text":"Where do I start? From soggy cold sandwiches to tasteless meat, I wish I had gone next door to the other sandwich establishment starting with a S. On a Bun makes underwhelming sandwiches that your little brother could whip up for you. The chicken does not taste like chicken because it is probably the frozen chicken breasts from the supermarket. The bun is probably the grocery store bun. Do yourself a favour and make yourself a better sandwich at home."}
{"text":"This humble little place is close to work, so we come here at least once a week. It's Italian sandwiches and that's it, but they know what they're doing. Chicken, beef, veal, meatballs, or sausage, on a bun, with homemade marinara. That's all they do, but they do it absolutely right. Also, the owners/managers are the nicest people ever. 

Do yourself a favour and at least try the veal. It's wonderful."}
{"text":"You want the Real Deal on this place. 
Ok here it is. I went to this place once It was pretty good. The vibe for a sandwich shop was pretty good. Friendly staff and she told me they deliver this made me happy. 

So now a couple days later i decided to order. I call the store they tell me they just use Hurrier or Just Eats. Problem for me but I ordered anyway. 

This my problem. It coast an extra $2 per sandwich and $5.50 for delivery. Which I except and pay the fee. Shitty won't do this again. Then my order was made incorrect. Problem #3 when you use a service and make the order incorrect This is a big problem. The company response is well next time I'm in they will make me a sandwich on them. Problem is why should my guess not be able to eat their food. So eat in yes  delivery NOT A CHANCE !!! Until this place get their own this place will remain mediocre to me. 

That's the Real Deal On this place."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm impressed, Hamilton! Someone recommended the little new sandwich shop around the corner. Needed a place to refuel before heading back to Toronto in rush hour traffic. Thought I would pick up a grilled chicken sandwich and just pick at it. I ate the whole sandwich; it was that good. The bun was very fresh and moist. The chicken tasted like chicken and with just the right amount of tomato sauce, grilled mushrooms and onions. A wonderful warm Italian chicken sandwich. The in-house marinated olives on the side were a nice touch. Great food, good experience. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm eating here alone on my lunch break and I really like it! Great service and my \"junior\"
Eggplant Parmesan is the bomb. And more than enough.

As a vegetarian that likes it super spicy I dig it. Their mozzarella sticks are homemade (this is one of my fav snacks ever) and their marinara was good but the star of the show was the sandwich, as it should be. Add onions :) it's worth it"}
{"text":"\"On a Bun\" I think we all know the drill by now; The classic italian sandwich tender pieces of meat carefully breaded, seasoned and fried to perfection. Tomato sauce, toppings galore piled high atop a glorious bun. 

I held off on going to 'On a Bun' for awhile because its right by 'The Big Three' (California Sandwiches, Bitondo's, San Franceso Foods). Turns out the new kid on the block is actually pretty cool once you get to know them. They serve a very good sandwich here, a seriously tasty little number. It's great stuff and the sides were more than adequate. Its neither good nor bad but one thing of note is that the bun is very soft.

Was it the best  sandwich I've ever had? No. Did it put a smile on my face? You bet. 

I'd like to take the time also to extend a warm congratulations to every member of the team as they are now celebrating 1 year in business. The service is beyond reproach and I eagerly await my next visit."}
{"text":"This is for meatball sandwich. Maybe other ones are better. It was combo of the day so i gave it a try. It was completely tasteless to me. I think subway next door has better meatball Girl on the counter wasn't friendly at all."}
{"text":"I like that this place is solid and reliable. It's a sandwich place! They make good sandwiches. The staff is always friendly and I've never had a problem with anything I've eaten here. If you're looking for a good meatball or chicken sandwich, you're way better off here than you are at Subway next door.

Try it! It's just a good sandwich place."}
{"text":"Great place to get a giant veal or meatball sandwich...love the taste and freshness except for the mushrooms which are definitely out of a can but the veal is delicious and the bread is soft, love  sweet sauce but not a fan of the green spicy sauce it ruins the sandwich...owners are really nice and glad to see a mom and pop sandwich place spreading instead of typical smart centre crap"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Happy I went with the junior size it was just enough. Meatball with cheese and mushrooms! Yum!!  Tasty. Well made. One of my party had the chicken parm and truly enjoyed it. (And they can be picky! )

One drawback: messy!  Maybe wet naps with your sandwich?

One thing's for sure.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I liked the sandwich honestly. It's a little different option around here and I enjoyed it. The meat was good quality, and you can add different toppings like eggplant for a little extra.

It's a little pricey, but the uniqueness and quality is worth trying once."}
{"text":"Came back today and I was more happy with my meal.  

Each week they have a featured sandwich that is part of their combo ($10 for a basic sandwich, can pop and a side (sausage, fries, salad or soup of the day) 

Today it was the meatball.

The meatball was nice (you get two) and the salad was nice size (not a tiny one you get elsewhere).  

The bun is very soft which is good if it's a sandwich.  Personally, I prefer a crusty on the outside but soft on the inside bun.  No probs because they make up for it in service.

It's a family business and the son working there is really nice.  He actually brought my items to the table as they became ready.  Plus, when people ordered and stepped outside, he'd actually go outside to give them their order.

It's the service that sells me and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ok...so if you live in Toronto the obvious comparison to 'On A Bun' would be California Sandwich's. To end that debate as quickly as it started, there is no equal to CS but there is a good alternative if you're hungry and can't walk north the 15 minutes, and it's found across from Trinity Bellwoods Park. 

California Sandwich's is the supreme leader for almost all categories, but On A Bun has them on a few small details. First, Cali has their Veal sandwich at about $11. Considering it's the size of a frisbee, that's not unreasonable. But OAB has their full size Veal at $7.99. It doesn't come with Cheese or mushrooms, which CS doesnt charge for, but the sandwich would be good with or without those toppings and for the budget conscious amongst us, that could be the difference between veal or no veal (Yeah, I said it!). The restaurant on Queen has tons of good seating, is quiet and the service was above good. I got the Veal with mushrooms and cheese and a side fry. Fries aren't bad...they're not great but they were good, and the serving is generous. Now to the sandwich: SOLID. It wasn't as if I would have mistaken it for California love, but it was still pretty damn good! Also a large brick of food, you won't be hungry after eating it! I had my fry and sandwich and I ate every last morsel of food. Then I lay down for about an hour. 

Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Get the meatball, avoid the veal. 

I went yesterday and ordered two junior sandwiches to try them out. They had a promotion on, $3 each, so even though I had a veal sandwich from California's the night before, I figured, why not. 

My wife ordered a hot meatball sandwich with chese and I ordered a medium (pepper) veal with onions and cheese. 

My veal was disappointing. The sauce was really good but the meat itself was very thin and hardly discernible between the breaded layers. If I just had this, I wouldn't go back. 

However, the meatball sandwich saved the day. The hot version packs a nice subtle punch without being overbearing. The meatballs were also tasty and it came together much better than the veal. 

I wouldn't recommend the place to others but I would go back for the meatball if I had a craving for that."}
{"text":"Great steak sandwiches. Make sure to get the side of olives to complete your sodium overload."}
{"text":"Delicious! I ordered the junior grilled chicken sandwich with cheese and sweet peppers. The difference between the regular and the Junior is and extra patty or piece of meat on the bun, although I found I was satisfactorily full from just the one. Location is convenient and it's always nice to have a little picnic in Trinity Bellwoods Park, even if you don't actually pack food. The service was phenomenal and the lady at front (I believe was Italian) was super sweet and personable and incredibly efficient. Overall a terrific  experience, definitely will stop by again."}
{"text":"Eggplant Parm sandwich is a must try. For a second, I thought they made a mistake and gave me veal. Super fresh, overall a good quality and filling sandwich. Toppings like mushrooms and onions are extra charge, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"So I stopped by yesterday to try their veal sammy. It was a nice clean place with plenty of seating. I added provolone to my sandwich and it came in at just under $10. Overall it was pretty damn good! I loved the jalepeno type spread rather than the full peppers with seeds - this way you get heat in every single bite! The bun was fresh and soft. The veal was not greasy like San Francesco up the road and also superior to California Sanwiches. I will be back fo sho!"}
{"text":"Guy who served me was a cheeky dickhead. Eggplant sandwich was good but a bit mushy near the middle. 
I'll be back."}
