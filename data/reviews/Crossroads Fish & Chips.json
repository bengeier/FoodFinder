{"text":"For over $20, I would expect a good order of fish and chips.  The fish was dry, fairly chewy, and the crust was hard and oily.  I would suspect that every part of the meal was from frozen commercially prepared products, except for the coleslaw, which was probably from a large jug.

The ventilation is not that good, so expect to wear a distinct grease aroma over top of your Ralph Lauren after shave.  For the same price as Chips & Malt, there is no comparison."}
{"text":"The burger I had from this place was sooooo good! I was randomly passing and saw fish and chop but left with a burger. It was a little over priced, but so is McDonald's for what you get in return. The food was great service was friendly. If your passing grab a bite."}
{"text":"The food was good. Hot. Fresh made. If you're expecting fine dining, this will not be for you. The ambiance should be your first clue what to expect. Dare I say it looks a bit seedy? It's bright and open, but hot and stuffy. I called ahead and my food was perfectly timed. I've been back a few times now and everything has been good. The fish is dipped in the batter as the order comes in. Portions are large. Friday special of 2 pieces of halibut & chips for $10.95 is very good deal. The people are a little brusk, but they work quickly."}
