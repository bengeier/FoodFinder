{"text":"Fantastic place! So far we've had fish and chips, curry chicken and the Guinness stew pot pie. Always accompanied by a Guinness with black current syrup. Truly a great find and makes one miss Ireland. Great for large or small parties, patio seating and great service!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! It was my first time here and loved the atmosphere. The server was very nice, I ordered the salmon Benedict which was phenomenal and everything was fresh and hot! My boyfriend ordered the curry chicken and it was okay, to many potatoes but overall great drinks and food. Def will come again to try other things."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried the Harp & Crown last night. Excellent evening and in my 25 years of living here in the USA this is the first authentic tasting British food from a restaurant. We shared a creative savory bread pudding for a starter. It was very light with tomatoes, leeks and a bubbly Irish cheddar cheese topping with a mushroom gravy. My husband had the chicken curry and I had the bangers and mash  - both just right. We hardly had room, but did eat the sticky toffee pudding just to try it and worth every mouthful. We will be back and ready to try a other things on the menu.  Well done Harp and Crown."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try and was immediately addicted to the braised beef.  Swore on my second visit to try something else but ended up with the braised beef again.  Fantastic.  But a lot of other things look great. Great service from waitress Hayley."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place but unfortunately it could not come close to them. My burger came back incorrect and was not very good at all. My wife's food (also a burger) was lackluster as well. Maybe it's just that their burgers are not very good but I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"So glad to see someone with actual cooking talent take this space!  Service was perfect,  guinness brisket was melt in your mouth and I even liked the Shepard ' s  pie which is not my normal favorite. Sorry wait,  well worth it. Great food. Can't wait to come back and try some other things. And btw, my side salad was tossed before it arrived. ...as it should be!"}
{"text":"Great pub atmosphere and service.  Delicious food. Great pub menu.  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We really like this place.  Great menu, with normal pub food but also some really awesome differentiators like the brisket mac and cheese, & the savory bread pudding.   Been several times for lunch and for dinner, and the food and the service are consistently good.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that, no matter how full I am, I cannot resist the sticky toffee pudding and/or the banoffee pie."}
{"text":"Gave the Harp and Crown a second chance. Atmosphere on patio area is very nice in spring. Food is good, not necessarily crave worthy. However, each time service has been slow and inconsistent. 3 stars for service issues."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago my husband and I were with another couple at Harp and Crown.  When we got there, we told the waitress that we only had an hour because we were going to a play.  She said that was no problem.  We ordered our meals and were served.  Three of the meals were fine but the tuna was awful!  Anyway, when we got ready to leave, we signaled our waitress to bring the check.  We gave her the two credit cards, each attached to the correct bill.  When she brought them back, the wrong bills were presented to each of us.  It turns out the manager had made the mistake.  We asked her to please fix it and that we were already running late.  After 10 minutes, we told the manager that we were going to be late for the play.  She gave us a dirty look!  After waiting again, we told her to forget it that we would fix it.  She handed them back to us and never said she was sorry for the confusion and slow process.  In fact she was very cold!  We were late for the play and had to walk in after it had already started.  A simple sorry would have been nice!"}
{"text":"Great things we've tried: the roasted chicken, the Guinness stew, Irish spring rolls, fish and chips. The desserts are very good as well so far. We've tried the sticky toffee pudding and the English toffee pie. The only thing I don't like is the tartar sauce that comes with the fish ansd chips. Very much of an olive/caper flavor...which I don't like. Great atmosphere with friendly, helpful staff. Patio looks like it will be great once it warms up!"}
{"text":"3$ pints on Thursday nights. You can't beet that! Nice patio and a ton of service. This is becoming my spot on Thursdays."}
{"text":"We arrived on a busy Saturday and were told it would be a 5 minute wait. In the meantime, 2 other parties arrived and appeared to know the hostess so they were seated right away. Annoyed at this point but willing to stick it out we gave the hostess the benefit of the doubt, she appeared to be the owner and I can understand treating your regulars to exceptional service. What I could not tolerate however, was being told we would be seated next until another couple walked in and promptly took their seat at the nearest open table. When the hostess saw this she told us sorry but somebody had taken our seat and we would have to wait again. At this point the 5 minutes had turned into 30 and the multiple occasions of preferential treatment to select customers had taken its toll. Clearly this establishment does not care about new customers and is content reaping the benefits of old business at the expense of new business. Truly is a shame as the atmosphere and menu looked great, but we decided to leave after having been treated so poorly. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great pub food and excellent, friendly service.  Can't wait for the patio to be open in Spring."}
{"text":"Visited The Harp & Crown looking for a new restaurant to offset the routine Cornelius offerings. I was very impressed from what I saw and what I ate. Drinks were on point and the Guinness pints were poured to perfection. Tried the Scottish Salmon and must say it was dynamite. Cooked exactly to my specifications. The chef knows obviously knows his way around a kitchen and the folks running the front of the house were extremely nice. Overall, I would say the Harp & Crown is well on its way to solidifying itself as the frontrunner in my list of places to eat in the Lake Norman area."}
{"text":"This English-Irish restaurant, Harp and Crown is probably one of the BEST pub and kitchens in Lake Norman/Charlotte. Consistency being the theme with service, decor, entertainment, food and atmosphere the lot. The Harp & Crown is mentioned with friends, family and neighbours. Almost every staff member is polite, informative and genuine and truly cares for their patrons with a truly great product. This establishment knows your name and makes friendly connections. Attention to detail is evident at H&C. The owners have even given a nice green look in the patio area. Daily specials and themes and cultural events keep patrons and social media entertained.  This is the closest and BEST thing to a British pub and kitchen you will find in the Cornelius area. Even the curtains have that look from home as well as many pictures of reminders from the homeland. A lot of hard work everyday go's into making this place a great experience so we will do our part in supporting the H&C."}
{"text":"An authentic irish/English menu.  I had the fish and chips which were amazing.  The fish tasted great and the chips were cooked just right.  The waitress was extremely friendly and personable.  They have a great draft and bottle selection as well.  The atmosphere is friendly, and though no music at the time  I was here, they do have live music from time to time."}
{"text":"I come by pretty regularly (typically for brunch once a week) & I have never had a bad visit.  Always great food. My party orders a huge range of food (everything from eggs benedict, shepherd's pie, burgers, french toast, fish & chips, to most of the dessert menu) & we've never had a bad meal.  Service is always great. Prompt and friendly waiters that don't hover over your table, but do regularly come by to fill your drinks.  Easily one of my top 5 restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Third and final visit.   Like the atmosphere, especially the patio area, but food was unexceptional twice and horrible / dangerous once.  On this visit we sat outside and just ordered their sampler, The Full Monty, which includes Shrimp Hushpuppies, Nachos, Wings, and Spring Rolls.    The spring rolls were unremarkable.  The Shrimp Hushpuppies were served to us with raw shrimp batter, twice.  Twice.  Imagine having a mouth full of what you think is Remoulade ... and then realizing it isn't.  (I'm not sure which was the best part - our server's anecdotes about the other customers similar complaints or management not even offering to adjust the bill.)  The Double Decker Nachos should have been labeled \"Greasy Mess in A Puddle\" and the chicken wings were undercooked but I didn't get a picture so you'll have to take my word for it.   I'm including a pic of the grease soup and raw batter balls."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Cornelius, NC and to Harp & Crown Pub Kitchen. This warm and comfortable pub features Irish favorites such as Shepherd's Pie, Fish & Chips, and Bangers & Mash.  Dora here. This front entrance does not give you a clue as to what to expect. Wait until you see the patio. Soooooo wish it hadn't been raining. I would've loved to sit outside here. I counted three fireplaces!! The interior was nice and cozy. And packed for 11 AM on a Sunday!  For my brunch, I chose the Shrimps & Grits, a combo of Charleston style grits, shrimp, bacon, and chorizo sausage. This dish was outstanding! Creamy grits, tender shrimp that melted in your mouth, ample sauce, and the sausage packed just the right amount of heat.  Dora here. Ya'll know by now that I'm a huge fan of Shepherd's Pie. If it's on the menu, that's what I'm picking. And since I'd seen an intriguing picture on Yelp, I already knew what I was ordering. Shepherd's Pie.   For those of you who haven't tried Shepherd's Pie, it's basically a layer of mashed potatoes smothering a blend of meat and veggies. In this case, hamburger and peas. This particular version was not as thick as other variations, and, for me, it lacked a bit in the flavor department, nothing deep or complex in those layers. But that's all good. Sometimes, like on this rainy day, you just want a dish to warm you up, comfort food, and Shepherd's Pie is always a good choice.   Happy St. Patrick's Day! What's your favorite Irish dish? We'd love to know! ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! You can't go wrong with anything that you order!  The people are always very nice and I have never had a long wait for my food. The Shrimp and Grits is to die for."}
{"text":"this place is a frequent(ish) favorite (we don't eat out a lot, but we often head here when we do!). it's a great space, ample beer selection and GREAT food.  i have no disappointments to report."}
{"text":"Best place around the lake for brunch and a blood Mary you could tell they are homemade and delicious!! Service was excellent and friendly! Would definitely recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Loved it .   I had the pork chop, and my wife had the Scottish salmon.  Both were very flavorful, and cooked to our likening. The cabbage slaw with  the pork chop was excellent. Service was very attentive, and the Manager stopped by.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place. I was excited to hear that a new local place opened up in the area, considering there just really aren't that many good restaurants in the area or I'm sick of them.   I went there on a Thursday night. They were doing  engravings on Guinness glasses and the place was packed. It was impossible to get parking, so I ended up parking on a side parking lot nearby.   We were seated promptly and our drink orders were soon taken. They use little vases to refill water, but if multiple people at the table are drinking water, you should just leave one of the vases there.   I got the bangers and mash which is mashed potatoes with vegetables and sausages. I was really pleasantly surprised. It was pretty good and topped with an onion gravy/sauce. The sausage had a lot of taste and the portion size was big too. Two of my friends got salads, which is pretty hard to screw up but they were large portions and looked good.   I'm excited to go back and try some of the appetizers and some of the \"old country\" entrées. This is a good local spot and I left very satisfied."}
{"text":"Recently our favorite Trivia guy relocated to Harp & Crown for his weekly show and I am so glad he did! The food is very good and the service is fantastic!  We ordered the Wedge of Cauliflower and the Dublin Salmon Cakes. The Wedge of Cauliflower had wonderful flavor. Based on the slight charred taste, I would imagine it is prepared on the grill. The boursin cream sauce is absolutely delicious! I would highly recommend asking for extra cream sauce. Even if there is an additional charge, it is worth it! The Salmon Cakes were also very good. The salmon was moist and came with a remoulade that added just enough flavor without completely masking the flavor of the salmon.  Make sure to take advantage of the 1/2 price bottles of wine on Mondays and Tuesdays! You might be wondering why I didn't give 5 stars when the food and the service were both excellent. We went with another couple who ordered The Queen of the South and The Mr Bean. Each burger came out with very little cheese and each of them had to request additional cheese. Even the server seemed surprised by the kitchen's lack of cheese. Other than that, I was quite pleased and will definitely return."}
{"text":"We arrived on Saturday night 15 minutes before the kitchen closed. I was apprehensive about staying hit the waitress talked me into it and was welcoming and friendly. The food and service was great. I will go back again. Previous restaurants in this spot didn't last and were not any good. I hope this was one makes it."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times.  I LOVED the bang bang shrimp and mashed potatoes!  Just make sure you go during dinner hours when they serve mashed potatoes.  :)  Good atmosphere, both inside and out!  Great outside seating!  Would def recommend and go back!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and had heard great things about this place but was horribly disappointed. After waiting over an hour for dinner, we were told that there were computer issues and it never when through. No solution, just a sorry no food for you."}
{"text":"Great new place in Cornelius.   Food is incredible!  Spring roll appetizer is excellent!"}
{"text":"Layers of flavor in the grilled cheese burger! Wow!! Words can't express how great this sandwich is. Happy with server too!"}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day Brunch.  The atmosphere is wonderful, staff is very friendly and the food was excellent.  Large portions and very affordable."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting family and they took us to the great place. The food was great, very fresh! The service rocked!! The owners were going around speaking to people and they were very nice as well. The atmosphere was great. It is like a little pub, but there were plenty of families there. It was cold, but I can't wait to enjoy the outdoor bar and patio this spring. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"So far... Excellent! Food was fresh, well prepared, great service! Our waiter Oliver was fantastic! And best part, they serve non-alcoholic beer for us non drinkers! We will be back."}
{"text":"We love the atmosphere and food variety, definitely one of our favorite local restaurants.  Doug is a great addition to your staff!"}
{"text":"I really REALLY wanted to like this place based on reviews. Went for brunch. Thought a $5 Bloody Mary was reasonable. I'm from NYC, so mostly everything here sounds reasonable.  It tasted like a watered down version of cocktail sauce. No vodka. No spice. Nada. I couldn't even finish it. I barely touched it. I tried to add more salt and pepper to give it taste. Nope. The 1 thing i was actually looking forward to today. It seems many places have issues making that drink. \"Fork\" does make amazing ones, but decided to try something new.  The food was ok. The omelettes were lacking something.   I read a handful of reviews and it all seemed promising. I'm hoping it was an off day. They place was nice. Decent looking pub. Had various menu items to pick from. Maybe Bloody Mary's and omelettes aren't their specialty.   One should always leave satisfied after a Sunday brunch. Not with a cocktail sauce taste and a little nausea.   I will however try again one day, maybe not brunch, but something else. It wasn't a train wreck so it deserves a second try. Just really REALLY disappointed in the Bloody Mary's"}
{"text":"Great place! The food is amazing and the staff could not be nicer . Alex the daughter of the owners is wonderful and so accommodating and kind and our server Nicole was fantastic.  We could not have asked for a better place to have dinner and great conversations.  We cannot wait until summer and dining on the outdoor area. Great walkable restaurant in cornelius.  Looking forward to having their fish on Friday during lent.  This has become one of our favorite spots now !!!  When you have great food and fantastic servers what else could you want !!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, dirty tables, drinks are watered down, food is mediocre. I would not recommend this place to anybody unless they want to waste their money. Wish I could give 0 stars"}
{"text":"Can't believe this was my first time here.  5 stars on food. We all had the Reuben which was one of the best we've ever had. Service was outstanding when we got there and they were super busy. As it began to slow down our waiter went MIA, no drink refills , had to to to the bar to get our check. That's just super annoying. So service at the beginning was a 5 and quickly went to a zero. They have happy hour during the week and we're excited to try it out. I really should give a 3 Star because service was that bad but for now I'll go for a 4 and will update on our next visit."}
{"text":"Harp & Crown is located in a small strip mall in Cornelius. Close to I-77, exit 28.  Draft pints were affordable and clean.  The owners are a warm, courteous married couple from the UK. When I asked about gluten free items, they took time to visit with me and explain all of their offerings. (There are options, but there is no dedicated fryer for such things.)   Apart from two great draft beers, I tasted the Curry Chips (Irish for \"fries\") and the Irish Spring Rolls. The fries themselves were tasty, the curry sauce may be better as a dipping sauce. Contrary to the name, Irish Spring Rolls aren't made of soap. It's cabbage, I think. The spring rolls were average.  Well-lit and comfortable, the decor is welcoming."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food! Bloody Mary was the only bad part (watery, no flavor) but was cheap! They have yummy cheap Bellinis too!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere inside and beautiful outside patio bar. Ask for Joe she was an awesome waitress and helpful with advice on food selection. Burgers are delicious and good selections of salad options."}
{"text":"Fabulous lunch! Sat outside, beautiful day. Amanda introduced herself immediately!  She is a great server, very attentive and not intrusive. She recommended a tuna entree normally on the dinner menu! It was superb. Seared tuna on soba noodles with a wasabi aoli and a hoisin sauce!  A peanut salsa atop a lemon! Beautiful presentation and excellent in taste!  Husband had a burger with Gruyere and onions and Irish bacon. Fabulous!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Fish and chips left much to be desired.  Service was good but rushed.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place stays in business. Horrible service and waitress had an attitude. Food was good but experience was terrible.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Had high expectations for the Harp & Crown and was a bit disappointed when we dined there this evening.  Harp & Crown is the latest in a string of restaurants that have been in this space over the years and they did have a good crowd this evening. The Harp and Crown is similiar to The Galway Hooker in menu and format although the menu is more English than Irish,  In any case, was torn between ordering the Fish and Chips or the Shepard's Pie. Ended up ordering the Fish and Chips which did not end well. The Cod had been breaded and when it was cooked, the fish shrank and the breading cooked to form a shell and the end result was more of a fish rattle. Hard shell with plenty of space before you got to the fish. Fish was oily as opposed to moist and flaky which is what I normally expect in Fish and Chips.  Not a regular fan of Cole Slaw but it was good as were the fries.  My wife on the otherhand ordered the Irish Rolls off of the appetizer menu and a side order of Mashed Potatoes.  An Irish Roll is a Corned Beef and Cabbage Springroll.  She enjoyed the Springroll and the plating was excellent.  Service is good and the wait staff well trained and attentive. Atmosphere is not radically different from Fireside which was the last restaurant in this space. Large bar area with big screen TV and a rather small dining area off to the side also with a smaller TV.  What will be nice with be the outside patio area that hopefully will open when warmer weather returns.  All in all, the Fish and Chips were not up to par but that is only one dish on the menu. Enough other items to try on the menu that I will be back but next time, will probably go with the Shepards Pie and see how that goes.  The restaurant does warrant another visit and hopefully, next time, my luck will be better."}
{"text":"I've been here for Brunch and I've been here for Lunch. Amazing both times. They really hit it out of the park. The Curried Chicken Hash is amazing for brunch. It would be hard for me to try anything else as perfect as this dish is. The Ruby Murray Curry is as good as well. Amazing dishes the both. Drinks are great as well. I've been to english / Irish pubs all over the world and this one holds it's own hands down."}
{"text":"Went one time not impressed same pub burger joint. Nothing really impressive . Very disappointed on st. Patrick's day. Over priced. But honestly , I wish the well . Maybe it was bad timing too."}
{"text":"Ambiance is the best out of everything else that has been in this location.  Great setting. Chips and curry is fantastic! The entrees were delicious. I got the pot pie and my boyfriend got the quinoa salad. He ended up eating half of mine, it was so good. Great addition to the Cornelius area. Definitely come in and try this restaurant.   The curry fries would make a great late night meal ."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed a nice evening on the patio with excellent service by Brendan.   Surprisingly awesome menu with lots of options.   I fell in love with Guinness again there.    Definitely have to try this place if your looking for something out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I live in Cornelius and this is probably my favorite restaurant in the area to have a nice meal and a couple of drinks. They have a good house lager, great appetizers and the food is delicious.  My wife is vegetarian and she was surprised to see the array of options she had. She ended up trying the black bean burger which had a kick to it, but not in a burning hot way. Nothing but positive comments there.  We tried the spinach & artichoke dip which came out hot and fresh, with great chips. I would say that it's a can't-miss appetizer here. The best part about it is the outdoor seating, when the weather was warm a couple months back during our visit, we had a great table outside and we were able to walk up the stairs out of the bar area to go down the street to grab some dessert and then hit our Uber home.  There are nicer restaurants in the area if you're looking for a \"date night\" type of place, and there are cheaper places if you're looking for only value for money, but The Harp & Crown is a great hang-out that combines value and quality with a bit of its own personality and flair."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this gem within our first few weeks of moving to the Charlotte area over a year ago. We've since moved south of Charlotte (South Carolina suburbs) and we still make it a priority to drive up here at least once a week! I love that their bartenders are all certified in pouring Guinness the correct way, and they are one of the few bars in the area that keeps Magners on tap. In the past year, I have probably tried everything on their menu at least once and have never been disappointed. The owners are among the most pleasant and genuine people I have ever met, which makes every visit here that much more enjoyable. If this is your first time, try the fish and chips or the Guinness braised beef brisket, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic venue! They accommodated our party of 15 and managed separate bills without complaint. The server never kept us waiting and got everyone's order right. The food was tasty and there was something for everyone. I was even able to hear my friends even though the place was packed. What a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Let me start with Ally, our server. She was amazing and spot on. She had only been there about a month but was the best service we've had in a very long time. Atmosphere was festive with a lot of Irish things. Nice beer selection and drink specials. Sangria was very delicious (not gonna lie, I tried the red and white, can't go wrong either way). Food...The food was spectacular. I had crab cakes Benedict and my partner had beef tip mash and were amazing. Managment was delightful and Mrs. Owner was delightful. We cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This was place was great! Went for lunch with some coworkers. Everything was excellent. The service was excellent and the waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing. I had the beef brisket sandwich with what appeared to be hand cut fries. The brisket was delicious and the fries were cooked perfectly. My coworkers got the fish and chips and the California Rueben. Both were reported to be very good. Overall we will be back and add this to our lunch rotation for sure."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  We waited a very long time for everything drinks and food.  They did explain that they were short handed in the kitchen due to the weather.  They should have comped us something, free drink, desserts something.  Prices seemed good and we all liked our meals.  We will give it another chance on a less busy night."}
{"text":"The ambiance and service was good. The menu extensive. They had a nice outdoor bar with 3 fireplaces as well as some patio heaters, but it was raining when we came in so we sat inside. The food came out promptly but was subpar. 2 of our party had the fish and chips and both said that it was nothing to write home about. I had the brisket mac and cheese which was a nice size portion , but it had peas in it, which was not mentioned on the menu. I hate peas! Had to try and pick them out. It was a flavorful dish, tho. Don't know if I would try again..."}
{"text":"Our family eats out a lot due to hectic schedules. I have no idea how anyone could give this place less than 5 stars for food, service, price, ownership, etc. It just doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner around 6:30 on a Wednesday. The interior decor is very comfy and has a cabin feel to it with all the wood. I ordered the fish and chips while my fiancée ordered the salmon which she enjoyed. My fries were nice and plump with a good crispiness to them. I was impressed with the amount of meat in my fish filet as most restaurants seem to be mostly breading with their fish and chips. The meal was accompanied by \"wet\" coleslaw and tartar sauce. The server, I believe his name was Derek, was incredibly friendly and kept up with our drinks well without us feeling intruded upon.   I was very pleased, albeit not blown away, with my visit and would likely come again (probably for brunch as I hear good things about that)."}
{"text":"The Harp and Crown has really good food, and really really great service! We were thoroughly pleased with the entire experience.   The only downside was that they don't offer brunch on weekdays, only on the weekends. But overall, no complaints, will definitely eat there again when in the Cornelius area."}
{"text":"During our wait, we encountered a great bartender named Joe. The Irish spring rolls were a stretch, but they only had flecks of corned beef. Order you burgers under done. The brisket Mac and cheese could use an upgrade. On my second visit, I met a friend on the patio. It was a nice evening, yet the patio was only 1/4 full. The bartender ignored her for 10 minutes. I showed up and he made eye contact with us twice, yet still did not offer a menu, a water, or to take our drink order. Eventually a server came to get our drinks and they were as ordered. Having been to Ireland, I had high hopes that this would be a go-to place. I'll probably give it one more chance."}
{"text":"Excellent food and we were able to catch some Irish dance on Saint Patrick's loved it!!!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed the Harp and Crown! The food was amazing, the service was great, and the ambience was perfect.  We had the quinoa salad, a really good start. I had the bean burger, probably the best I have ever had at a restaurant, and my hubby had a burger with onions, mushrooms, and cheese. He completely enjoyed it.  Our waitress Haley was very knowledgable and friendly. She explained the menu in detail and helped us make good choices.  We are looking forward to our next visit and the better patio weather."}
{"text":"Overall one of the best experiences in cornelius area.  Great food great atmosphere and great service. The outdoor bar is wonderful   It's about time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food were great. It's a casual but elegant place.  I had the Irish Spring rolls and Shepherd's pie! Both excellent! The peanut butter pie was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great fish & chips!! So light, but greasy at all, and a great portion. My daughter got & loved the bangers & mash. Our waiter was less than attentive despite the place being almost empty, but the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I drove here with high expectations of hopefully receiving authentic British Isles fish and chips.   Fish?  Basically three fancy fish sticks and not the long solid piece of beer battered cod or haddock that I was expecting or what one would receive in the UK.  Chips? (Fries to us Americans) Slim cut French fries and nothing more. These were not the proper steak type chips found in the UK. They also weren't cooked properly, meaning they weren't golden brown and crispy. They also were not cooked in beef fat like they would do in the UK. Beef fat = lard or Crisco. This is what McDonald's does and we all know that Mickey D's has the most highly regarded FF in the fast food industry. This is the reason why.   In the UK it is generally accepted that malt vinegar and then salt is added to ones chips. I did the same with the chips that I received, but they were so limp that they didn't absorb the malt vinegar. FAIL!  Coleslaw? My side was automatically coleslaw. The traditional side in the UK is mushy peas, which is on their menu. I'm sorry that I didn't get to try this, because I've never had them before. Sadly, I wasn't given the option.   Tartar sauce? Very good.   Beer? Harp. Ice cold and very good. THE best thing on the table.   Service? Cheerful and friendly. Very good.  Price? Entree and beer + tip = $20. The entree itself was a little more expensive than Long John Silvers and half as good. I was expecting better.   I'm sure that there are some excellent items on the menu that I need to try, but my \"toe in the water\" test of the food was pretty much underwhelming. I may go back to try some of the other traditional items, but it won't be anytime soon. There are plenty of other British Isles restaurants to sample first."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Great food and service with a smile. They make you feel welcome. Love the outdoor bar and seating."}
{"text":"Don't miss this place!!  Best place in Cornelius just tucked away in a corner spot. Couldn't choose between several items but sampled from others. The shepherds pie was incredible, the service was really fantastic, the ambiance was great and I'll definitely be back. ...possibly tomorrow. Lol"}
{"text":"Harp and Crown was pretty good.   We have been here before and I thought that I left a review but guess not.  So here it is based on 2 visits.   Overall it is a good place and would return.    Food - We had the Braised Lamb and the Guinness Brisket.  Both we pretty good.  I thought that the Braised Lamb could have used a little more flavor but everything was good.  I had a taste of the Brisket and the flavor was spot on.     Service- I think that there was a new server training that was helping us.  Not to say that it was bad, but it was a little lackluster.  I will say that the owner/manager stepped up and took care of us making sure that we were happy.  That is a sign of good management and team approach.     Atmosphere-  it was a beautiful day and we sat on the patio.  Great area and addition to the restaurant.  Just really capped off a great visit.     Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Don't even question it, just get the Jameson flight. You'll thank me later. lol, I had the Irish meatloaf, and yes it brought memories. Just like Mom used to make it. Server was attentive and made sure the well never went dry."}
{"text":"My wife is happy, they have her British favorite, stick Toffee pudding.  I went there Wednesday and it was packed with Brits. I felt right in since I lived in the U.K. many years. The food is good and they have stella (and many other favorites).  The owners are from England and Ireland, so I feel they will do all they can to keep an interesting atmosphere.  There is and outdoor area for drinking/dining, etc. I missed the bag pipes on Wednesday night unfortunately. That was cool since we are in the Scotch-Irish part of the county.  I plan on going there often as long as my wife gives me a kitchen pass, but she will be with me occasionally."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch! It was a great experience, wait staff was excellent, The food was great. I ordered the salmon omelette with a side of hashbrowns smothered in onions. My friend ordered the bacon egg and cheese sandwich on Texas toast. And we ordered Mamosa's which were delicious also. If you have a dog they allow dogs of course they must be of good manners great ambience, with patio and outside bar I would definitely return again."}
{"text":"Average pub food with a decent atmosphere.  The outdoor patio was a bit unkept. The wait staff was friendly and the fish and chips were good.   I ordered a a brisket sandwich that tasted more like shredded roast beef from a crockpot. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This place has the best patio we have been to in Lake Norman. Great drinks and atmosphere!!! Highly recommend, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best brunch we've had in ages. Very good service and waitstaff too.  Highly recommend them. Great patio space too. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the fish and chips. Fish wasn't salted and I can't stand adding table salt to a finished dish. Everything should be seasoned before hand. Big no-no for me. Secondly, the fish came with a lemon SLICE. Why isn't it a wedge?? How am I supposed to squeeze lemon on my fish with a slice?! Thirdly, the coleslaw. It was seasoned with a \"chili\" seasoning. It would have tasted perfect on a hotdog but did not go well with fish and chips. Service was great however."}
{"text":"I'm done here. A few St. Pat's in the bag and something shady each time. Laides/Bartenders you must think we are a bunch of nincompoops. When your sign says Drafts $5 IPA $6, why did you charge me 6.50 (no itemized ticket was brought out with the one I signed)? I watched you pour and collect $6 for the people with cash. And why did you tell the gent next to me $5 for his beer, and then only bring him $4 in $1's back after he gave you a $10? He asked me for clarity and I gave it to him. Ya'' cheated him out of a buck. I am glad you did the cash only food register under the tent. That might help people from getting over charged for food like I was the first year I came. Anyhow, three strikes and you're OUT! No trust! Oh, and Ms. Elwell, the counselor from MGSD MHS, why didn't you say hello from behind the bar? You knew it was us. And you knew I was not a fan of you as a counselor either. Makes sense now."}
{"text":"Old owners of restaraunt x, which was a great place! This place is perfect. Beautiful  exterior , food is incredible and it feels like the kinda place where everyone will know your name!!! I highly recommend it and say hi to Joe the bartender. He is so fun and nice!"}
{"text":"Ive wanted to try this place for a while- had 2 appetizers and some drinks. Corn beef cabbage spring rolls and Chicken quesadillas which were amazing! Very filling   But, I found my new favorite dessert!!! Banoffee Pie is everything!! I'm not a big dessert fan, but this would be my if I could eat one last dessert!!! Get it!   Amazing bar outside, live music and overall a great vibe!  Try it! Craig the bartender is awesome"}
{"text":"First time at the Harp and Crown. Really nice atmosphere! My husband had the brisket and I had the fish and chips. We will definitely check this place out next time we're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Been only for brunch three or four times. I highly recommend the sticky toffee french toast and the salmon benedict. Great food, service, and reasonably priced. Great job Harp & Crown."}
{"text":"We checked out the Harp and Crown with some friends last night and had a great experience. Note that it is on the small side--not a lot of tables, but they do accept reservations. It was a full house (Friday evening around 6:30), but thanks to a little planning our party of 6 didn't have to wait for a table.  There are some unique cocktails offered on their drink menu (a version of a Russian mule, peachatini, cheeky monkey, etc.), and also a great beer selection.   We started off with the curry chips based on reviews here and they were as good as reported! We also tried their spring rolls that are filled with corned beef and cabbage with a great mustard sauce and they were also really good.  The issues with their fish and chips must have been resolved because they were really good last night. We tried several of their burgers (Mr. Bean was excellent) and the Paddy Pacino (very good although the burger was a little overdone, definitely not cooked to medium). You can also ask for a side of their curry sauce for dipping your chips--it is a delicious treat. The salads are a little pricey for the size of the serving (particularly for the meal-sized salad), but it was still good flavor-wise. The Guiness-braised brisket was delicious, although the size of the meat looked more like what you'd see at a \"fancy\" restaurant than what we expected from a pub.  Overall we really liked the Harp and Crown. I agree that they need a POS system because the hand written bills seemed a little clumsy. The service was also good, but a little on the slow side (a POS system could help improve that). We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Finally a place that may make it at this cool location. The outside patio and bar is a perfect spot for sunny days. The British pub atmosphere is a nice touch and something that we don't really have up here at the Lake."}
{"text":"My wife and our families just had our rehearsal dinner there the other night with the Harp and Crown. Every single person from the bus boys to the bartenders and especially the owners where beyond accommodating.  They prepared a special menu for our day and made an area for our families to relax and celebrate with us. We have been there many times before and are huge fans of their menu. We are patrons for life and look forward to dinning with them in the near future. Thank you Christina, for everything."}
{"text":"What a great find. This place has it all. Indoors has plenty of tv's plus a big screen (I will be watching World Cup here if I'm traveling). Outside is really nice with a cool bar and more tv's. I had fish and chips and they were very good along with a nice craft IPA. I was craving wings later while watching the Panthers lose and the very nice bartender said they could make them, even though they aren't on the menu. Well they should be!  I generally stay at the Hampton while I travel here for work and this will be my go-to place for dinner and beer."}
{"text":"Great new place. Sat at the bar. Bartenders were fast and attentive. Had a new drink called Vermont Bourbon Sour loved loved loved it. Had the fish and chips hubby had the braised brisket both were excellent Finished every last bit. I usually go to Charlotte for my fish and chips so glad to know there's a place right where I live that's closer and better. Will definitely be back very friendly place. Welcome to Cornelius"}
{"text":"This might be one of my favorite burgers in the area but it is definitely my go to for any Irish fare.  The bangers and mash are possibly my favorite item but really any of the traditional Irish dishes will wow your palette.  The fish and chips are two hearty pieces of fish.  They have a fantastic outdoor patio and bar."}
{"text":"Everything is wonderful. The Full Monty Appetizer.   Fish and chips are great. The banoffee pie is amazing! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Met a girlfriend here for lunch. The staff was well-meaning but rather neglectful. Keeping water glasses filled is basic. Our meals were decent, but nothing special. The bathroom needed cleaning and the floors all over were sticky. Given the choice, I'd give this place a pass next time. This is a Sports Bar, but there's no reason for the lack of cleanliness."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite restaurant and bar in LKN. Great food. Amazing outdoor bar. You'll feel like you're on vacation every time. The service is super responsive. It's family owned and Alex is so cool!"}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars I would. The manger and staff was awful. The bartender Kim was so rude. I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow and the beer selection was limited, but the fish and chips was legit and they had no problem accommodating our large unplanful group when we showed up with a party of 15."}
{"text":"Kind of an unexpected good time. I had a group of friends in the area for my birthday and after closing down a local brewery, we were looking for some good food nearby that would still be open late. Here's where The Harp & Crown enters the picture.  Thanks to the ol trusty Yelp app and it's \"Open Now\" feature, TH&C showed open late and had good reviews.  We got in just a few minutes before the kitchen was closing and they were nice enough to still allow us to put in orders for six people.  A few decent local beer selections for liking. The appetizer came out with the food which is always frustrating, but that means we got our food in a decent time... and for six hungry people that's a good thing. All positive reviews from my table regarding the food. The app: spinach and artichoke dip with chips was tasty. I heard the bangers and mash was a good dish and I enjoyed/scarved down The Royal burger!  The friendly staff was accommodating and the restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips! Lad at the bar very friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The Best food we have had from uptown Charlotte to Lake Norman area. Great atmosphere, music and hospitality. We came for dinner & drinks - it was so good we came back for brunch. This friendly atmosphere makes everyone feel at home. Awesome bloody Mary's, Salmon Cake Benedict and filet mignon Benedict will have you coming back for more. This is a real find for a nice afternoon or evening out. Sit in the sunshine on the fabulous patio with wood burning fireplaces. Very relaxing atmosphere. Just off the main Catawba avenue. Easy to find, easy parking and super welcoming staff. We will be back for more of this delicious menu. So much love gone into this restaurant and it shows. A Must try. A real treat!"}
{"text":"Visited Harp and Crown for Mothers Day,, had their English breakfast, excellent food and the best service I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. They did a nice job with the place. Got pretty busy for dinner on a Friday night which is to be expected, but the dining area tables are a little cramped. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Harp and Crown is a decent spot and has a great patio! The service has left a bit to be desired lately (specifically the outdoor service), but they always have good drink specials.  I am vegan and I always get the quinoa salad without cheese, and I get a side of fries to go with it because their fries are great!"}
{"text":"Went here this past Saturday night and the ambiance was great! There was live music, great crowd and our server was awesome! I got the Fish & Chips, which was delicious and their Mac & cheese is a must have!"}
{"text":"I'm reallllly into this place! I loved the food at restaurant x in Davidson when the owners of H&C had it, so I was glad to hear they opened at a new location!! The shepherds pie is off the chain, the bangers and mash is SO good (although the second time I had it l, the bangers were a big over cooked), the fish n chips is not so good (a couple friends confirmed this to us), the curry fries and burgers are so fabulous.. And I think/hope that some of the little kinks work out over time as they are still so new to this location!! They DEFINITELY need to invest in a POS system because the splitting of checks situation is a long process with hand written checks!! Drinks are great, bartender is super friendly... An all around great place! (I will revise and give 5 stars once some kinks are worked out ) ;)"}
{"text":"Just back from The Harp and Crown. Great food, great Guinness! I had the fish & chips and my wife had the shepherd's pie ... both enjoyable. Service in the patio area was superb and our waitress, I think her name was Emma (from New Jersey), was pleasant ... and quick with the drinks and the food. Wish we could have stayed for Trivia Night, but have early start in the morning. Cheers!"}
{"text":"How have I not discovered this gem earlier? I am constantly in this area. Can I just say the BEST. FISH. & CHIPS. Hands down, I've never had better. Huge portions, fantastic service and ambiance. A must visit."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips that are not overpowering in size. Great bar setting with BPL and other European soccer/football kits all around. They have a wonderful patio/full service bar with 3 outdoor chimneys. Further, they have Magners on tap (always better) and they pour Guinness the way it is supposed to be poured."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been meaning to try this place since they opened in December. Well almost a year later and I am kicking myself in the rear for waiting this long. We went tonight, a cool October evening. All three fires were lit and a band was playing. It was the PERFECT date! So scenic! My fiancé ordered the shrimp and grits, which were AMAZING and I ordered the chicken quesadilla appetizer (only because I wasn't very hungry) and they were also great! I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! Celebrated moms 77th birthday today, the food and atmosphere were perfect! If you are a breakfast person they have the best brunch around. Large servings so you definitely leave full! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service is painfully slow. Took 20 minutes for a glass of water . Food was fair. Not going back."}
{"text":"Great little place, like the owners. I kind of feel bad for them as its a rough find. I looked for this place for months after heating about it. Its tucked behind near the boxing place. Its has outside heated seating and the meals are really good, like an old fashioned family meal place. The soup a great and we shared an baptizer. We will go back for a full dinner as this was just for a quick bite. Everything tasted very fresh. Good selection of bear"}
{"text":"So-  sadly the \"owner\" ordered the employees to move a nest of bird eggs from the bar heater..in front of Customers.  The mom and dad birds returned without a nest.  We all had to watch the sadness.  Selfish corporate America wanting  to make a dime this evening at the cost of wildlife...and this is a family owned business even worse!!!"}
{"text":"Finally looks like this location, which has housed a number of flops previously, has finally found a combination that will stick. Harp and Crown offers a number of Irish/British classics like fish n chips, Shepherds Pie, Curry, etc. along with a nice selection of burgers, salads and pasta dishes.   I had the fish n chips and my wife had the Shepherds Pie. We were both happy with our choices. The fish was thick and moist with that crackling good crust that only a nice beer batter can provide and the pie had tons of flavorful meat, gravy and veggies under a layer of creamy mashed potatoes.   The service was an interesting combo of gruff but attentive and we both tried a cocktail off the menu. Nice that we could each actually taste alcohol in the drinkS. Not always the case.   H&C seems like a good addition to LKN."}
