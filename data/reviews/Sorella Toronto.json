{"text":"We accidentally found this sausage store and good thing we found this store! We bought mild Italian sausages, peameal bacon and smoke bacon. Peameal bacon was amazing! We can enjoy taste of pork. This pea meal bacon was the best in city! Sausage was great, too! So meaty and tasty! Lots of meat shops and restaurants serve pea meal bacon or sausage,but they are always so salty,but Sorella isn't. We will definitely go back to this shop again!!"}
{"text":"Was there yesterday afternoon and he was just making some fresh mild Italian sausages so decided to pick up 10pcs plus some peameal bacon and smoked bacon.  The place has only been around for 7 months so still new to the area.    Tried both the peameal bacon and Italian sausage today and going back next weekend to order more! The peameal bacon actually tasted like pork and not salted meat like others I've tried and I've tried a lot all over the city. It was so nice for breakfast this morning, I wished I had bought more yesterday.    The Italian sausage was for dinner and it was meaty, not just fatty ground pork and again not made to last months in the fridge (ie overly salty) .  Just the right amount of heat for mild and tasted great. I had so many requests for extra that I ran out.    I have found the place for sausage and bacon and couldn't be happier!"}
{"text":"Best sausage in the city!!! Mild, hot and extra hot! Get there early in the morning, these sell out fast. Or call ahead to place an order. Also does custom orders for wholesale."}
{"text":"We decided to drop by Sorella's after noticing his storefront signage for \"Toronto's Best Italian Sausage\". Sorella's is very small and only makes sausages. You can either purchase a freshly made sandwich or buy take out raw sausage links. The lunch menu consists of housemade sausage on a mattachioni bun with rapini and mustard. To make something so simple yet so delicious can be difficult, but Sorella's has it deliciously perfected.   Service was 5 stars. Mario was a gem and he played amazing music (we are a fan of the Clipse). He was super friendly, genuine, and clearly passionate about his work!!"}
{"text":"So went out of our way to drop this place to get some sausages after seeing so many good reviews on here.    You can get both cooked sausages on a bun or just buy the raw sausages to take home.    There is only one guy working there and 2 other ladies in front of us so we had to wait maybe 3-4 minutes to be served.  There is no seating here.  We got a handful of mild sausages which turned out to be alright - but \"meh, I've experienced better\".   There are definitely better sausages that you can get in the city.  The disappointing part of all of this and hence the 2 star review, is that the same guy who was handling the meats with his bare hands, also handled the money.  There were no gloves being used for either. We did wash our meats before cooking them.    Can't say that we will be back.  :("}
{"text":"I just moved back to Toronto, so I was over the moon to discover Sorella's in my neighbourhood. This place is fantastic. It's like my grandmother is cooking for him! f you are ever craving some really classically Italian sausage, this is the place to go.   In terms of take out meals: the lunch sandwiches are a sensible portion, topped with really nicely done rapini and a strong mustard. I recommend grabbing the hot before you try the others. I've yet to have the bacon, but I suspect it'll be just as good.   Definitely give this a try if you're looking for a quick bite in the Junction."}
{"text":"I love this place. The guy who runs the shop is friendly. The sausages are amazing. (My wife who normally isn't a fan of sausages also loves them.) I've only ever had the spicy ones (who wants mild?) and they have a good kick to them. I'd say it's pretty pricy for fresh sausages, but you get what you pay for I suppose."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Sorella Toronto the other day. The restaurant owner was very friendly and nice to talk to. The sausage and pasta was freshly made and delicious. The restaurant doesn't have beverage other than water, which is quirky in its own way."}
{"text":"Amazing sausages!  Stopped by for the first time to pick up some sausages for dinner (due to the positive Yelp reviews) and I was not disappointed. Baked the sausages in the over at 400F for 40 mins with onions, red peppers and green peppers. Delicious!  Will be making this a weekly staple for sure. Highly recommended."}
