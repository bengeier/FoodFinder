{"text":"We stop into Watercress quite often as it is close by. They are always extremely friendly, whether we are picking up to-go or staying in the restaurants. The restaurant itself is extremely bright, clean and open. I love how you can see into most of the kitchen!

We've tried a number of the appetizers but my favourite by far are the taro wontons, absolutely delicious and like nothing I have ever had before. However, the spring rolls are a delicious classic as well. I always go with the satay pho which I have eaten at a number of Vietnamese places and Watercress is by far my favourite. The boyfriend is more adventurous and likes to try everything on the menu, he hasn't had anything he doesn't like yet. The food always tastes incredibly fresh and comes out nice and quick. I highly recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"Didn't get to try any food but got the mango bubble tea with the lychee flavoured jellies which was recommended by the man working and it was the best bubble tea I have every had, so fresh, not too sweet, delicious chunks of mango and the lychee jellies are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Watercrest for a quick bite. You order and pay at the front, then the food is brought to your table.
I ordered the kimchi fried rice and out comes this gigantic plate of  perfectly seasoned rice with home made kimchi and a fried egg on top. 
It was simple, delicious and very filling for $10.
This would make a great side between two or three people if you wanted to order other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome! My family and I go as often as we can. Excellent value for money based on the flavours, presentation and preparation. I have to say that this is such an awesome and totally unexpected experience. This is not your typical Vietnamese restaurant and the counter ordering makes it feel like a fast food restaurant but the food is so, so much better than any fast food restaurant I've ever seen!!"}
{"text":"This is a great new Vietnamese place on 17th. Our food was flavourful and satisfying. Great service too and a pleasant, clean dining space."}
{"text":"Once again...Watercress Express 
The Best
If you love Vietnamese cuisine. ...and haven't been to Watercress Express. ......you are missing the best in Calgary"}
{"text":"A great new Vietnamese place on 17th Ave, and conveniently right near work for me! A friend at work mentioned it (I tuned out for a while wondering why he was so excited about the vegetable, watercress) and eventually realised he was talking about Vietnamese food. 
I ordered by phone to takeaway and the girl on the other end was super friendly, and then I picked it up 10 minutes later. I ordered the vegetarian spring rolls ($6), which came as two large crispy spring rolls in a foam container with a small air hole to keep them crispy and a sweet chilli style dipping sauce (for which they checked to see if I was vegetarian to offer me a vegetarian sauce if needed - I didn't, but it was very sweet that they checked). The spring rolls were still crispy even after I walked home and reheated them slightly, and packed full of veggies which was nice. I also had the Sweet Chilli Lime Chicken Wrap (aka rice paper rolls, $7.75), which came sliced up like sushi on a bed of sweet chilli sauce - around 10 pieces. It was nice and light (and sort of balanced out my spring rolls!) with pieces of fresh herbs, crispy spring roll chips and vermicelli in there.
The place was pretty quiet when I picked up my order with only two people dining in, but it was around 8:30pm on a Wednesday night. It was pretty big, clean and modern - looked like a great place to stop in for a quick and fairly healthy and cheap bite to eat."}
{"text":"The Sate Pho here is the best I've had. Not an expert by any means, but it's now a weekly ritual."}
{"text":"I ordered a tofu stir fry. It's pretty quick if you're looking for take out. The serving was big, and the prices were good for everything. I wouldn't mind going there and eating inside either. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly. The food is delicious and the service is great. Location is clean and well maintained. 

The classic dishes are on order but there's lots of variety / twists involved. This is for sure my favourite Vietnamese food in the city and I recommend it to everyone I can!"}
{"text":"I was here a few days ago and would say this place is pretty darn tasty. I just tried the beef and spring rolls on vermicelli. It wasn't anything more special than any other Vietnamese restaurant, it was just as good. Other than the bowls are shaped differently lol. 
It's not a huge place, it has about a dozen or so tables. It's relatively clean inside, and the menu board consists of three television screens ?
I wanted to try the Kimchee rice I had seen pics for from other reviews, but didn't see it on the menu. 
I'll definitely come back again, and try something different.

Service was just an okay experience. The guy who took my order wasn't overly friendly imo."}
{"text":"I met the owner David, a keen Vietnamese man, and his assistant, Bicolano Carlo, and quickly found out much more than considered:
1.  that they've carried on the Watercress tradition with David's own twist,
2.  that one can get good Pho Bun Hoe at the Bun Bo Hue Deli in Little Saigon Mall, Calgary
3.  that perhaps the best Cantonese dim sum is at T-Pot in the same mall area as T&T supermarket, Harvest Hills district of north Calgary, close to Raj Palace (some of the best southern Indian in the province)
4.  that he enjoys Blaze Pizza that's another fairly new arrival in Calgary. Amazing that he'd recommend other places, but sometimes conversation is just that stimulating when it's about good food.

Watercress' menu is easy to navigate with plenty of choices in each of the 5 major categories.

Although the Pad Thai noodles were recommended by another foodie, David steered me back to his Vietnamese dishes, and after some discussion, ordered the Sate Pho. 
But before it arrived at the table, as a new customer and as is the custom of Vietnamese chefs elsewhere, he kindly gave me some deep-fried pork spring rolls to try. Delicious!
And the sate pho? Very good. I am more a fan of pho bun hoe in Asia, but this huge sated dish was tasty, with quality noodles and flavours, and by far better than most other sate pho I've had anywhere else in AB.
On the 2nd visit, tried the Pad Thai stir fry, and was very good: the flavours were mildly blended for my palate, and the tomato-based 'hot' sauce added some zing when wanted. Next time I wlll ask for more spices (not spicey) to the dish, but filling and tasty

Super meal presentation, really tasteful Indochinese music, and attractive furnishings.

Most dishes are only $12-14 and the portions are larger than expected. I think all of David's dishes would be good to great. Customers can also get take-out, regular delivery, Skip the Dishes, and catered banquets.

Want some good pho, wraps, rolls, vermicello and rice dishes, soups or stir fry? Come to Watercress and see if you will agree."}
{"text":"I had a sub, chicken wrap, and pork spring rolls for take out. The staff is friendly and helpful, my order arrived fast and was tasteful."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and I would rate it as one of the best Vietnamese food that I've had in this city. The portions were great, food was flavorful, and the fish sauce tasted authentic and not watered down like every other restaurant I've been to. 

I had the charboiled pork and spring roll rice vermicelli that tasted like home and the pork was super tender. The plate was loades with greens and pickles veggies. I also tried the pork/pineapple salad roll that was so fresh with a hint of mint leaves. The price of menu items were more expensive than traditional Vietnamese restaurants, but I would pay it for the quality of the food. People expect Vietnamese food to be cheap but I would like to disagree. When the flavour and presentation is elevated, why wouldn't you pay more?!"}
{"text":"I love Watercress! We tried an assortment of dishes so this is my take on the food. Food reminds me of Raw Bar.

Appetizers - you can't go wrong with anything. Note that portions are smallish, so if you share an appy, get two. Shrimp salad rolls, pork spring rolls and chai su won tons were delicious.

My favourite dish, surprisingly, was the shrimp and chicken fried rice. I'm not a fan of fried rice, but this version was refreshing and so tasty. Beef sate was rich in flavour and heavy on the beef. 

Any of the bao or subs are fantastic. I've tried the lemon chicken and beef short rib. I love the flavours of the marinated meats, herbs and unique condiments. 

The food is top notch and the prices are great considering the quality of the food. A main plus an appy will set you back anywhere from $12-18 bucks. I left happy and full."}
{"text":"Looks to be a promising restaurant for upscale Vietnamese food.
We ordered one salad roll shrimp appetizer and it was really tasty.  Presentation was unexpectedly beautiful for what we are accustomed to in typical Vietnamese restaurants.  Having said that, I'd always prefer taste and quality over visual presentation.  But it was a nice touch in any event and showed the level of care and thought that the kitchen staff put into their food.
The beef pho was solid and presented very artfully in its large 3/4 bowl.  Those who are use to controlling the amount of bean sprouts that they put into their bowls will be disappointed as it is preset for you fro the kitchen.  But I'm guessing gif you ask the waiter ahead of time, I'm sure they would accommodate you in tailoring your bowl require,nets as they seem to very customer oriented.
The satay Pho was different so depending on your taste preferences it may or may not be to your liking .  It had a sweet yet spicy kick.   I find that people's reviews of satay foods are very individualistic and are biased to their likes or dislikes of spice and peanut-iness.  
The owners and staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  
Overall for the slightly higher price than regular Vietnamese restaurants, you get an upscale dining experience with the nice presentation and great service.  Food quality is above average also but we will have to give it a more thorough try next time with some non-pho dishes to see how it rates.  But for now very promising,"}
{"text":"Just because \"To err is to be human\" does not mean nothing is perfect.   Well, Watercress Express is as near to perfect that I can imagine.  A routine Saturday lunch turned into a fabulous meal at Watercress.  Friendly staff, simple menu, fair prices, and speedy service are readily apparent.  The food is colorful, wonderfully spiced, and well presented.  We had the Sate Pho and Wok Beef Salad.  Rich flavors and crunchy, fresh ingredients.  The Sate Pho was bursting with umami beef broth flavors and chili spice.  Just, might I say, perfect!  Decor of Watercress is inviting.  (Even the water closet was perfectly kept)  So, do yourself a favor:  Enjoy the (near) perfection soon at Watercress, even if you are just a human like me."}
{"text":"After reading the great Yelp reviews, my boyfriend and I had to try Watercress. The salad rolls were fresh as were the rice vermicelli dishes we both ordered. Fast and friendly service. Definitely a place we will come to again!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading tons and tons of raving reviews online. I would rate the place a 3.5 if half stars were available. 

Just so everyone is aware, there is new management at this restaurant. I've never visited prior to this change so I can't comment on what's different. I believe there are a few menu changes (we read about a kimchi fried rice online and could not find on the new menu). 

It's a small place located on a busy part of 17th. It's a restaurant but kind of not. You pay for your food and take a number and they bring it out to you. There are a couple of tables and chairs for people who want to eat there. I saw many people coming in for take out while dining there. 

We tried the shrimp salad roll, chicken and shrimp fried rice and the satay pho. 

Shrimp salad roll was good, presented very nicely on a plate with fish sauce and peanut sauce on the side. We could tell the roll was made fresh because the shrimp was just grilled and still warm in the roll. 

Fried rice was also made fresh. Came out steaming hot. It was good but the chicken tasted a bit dry. 

Satay pho was not what I expected - it tasted more closer to a bunbohue with a tangy taste rather than the spicy satay I was expecting.

Oh, also tried the Vietnamese iced coffee here and they were great. Really strong and full of flavour. 

The service was great and they checked with us if the food was ok. 

Overall it was good but not sure if worth the price - I kind of felt like the restaurant was almost a food court style the way you pay for your food first and they bring it out. The food tasted good but not mind blowing amazing as the reviews portrayed for me. Perhaps due to change in ownership? I might be back for the salad rolls but it's pretty hard to justify the price. If you're looking for \"fancy\" Vietnamese food, I think Taste of Saigon does it better and it's an actual restaurant at the same (if not cheaper) price point."}
{"text":"Wow! Fantastic sate soup. Had not had such a great bowl of fresh made soup like this in awhile. You could really taste the lemongrass and the spice was at a perfect level. Also tried a vietnamese satay beef sub. That was a little to sweet for my liking as I much prefer the really spice ones. Fo sure will be on my list for a return visit next time we're in town."}
{"text":"We've been keeping our eye on the space for weeks as they get ready to launch a new \"Modern Vietnamese\" restaurant on 17th ave, and when we went in for lunch today we were more than pleased with the results. The menu has some of your standard favourite Vietnamese dishes, vermicelli and rice bowls, salad wraps, subs etc, but they also have some interesting Korean and other influences. Most of the dishes are meat but there are things for veggies to enjoy as well.

I started with the tamarind beef wrap which was beautifully presented in pieces like you would a sushi roll, together with a little  radish slaw and some spicy hoisin sauce. They tasted every bit as good as they looked, with a freshness that was quite unexpected and totally delightful.

The hillight of lunch was the braised pork cheek bon which was served with some grilled pineapple, apple slaw and wasabi mayonnaise on the most amazingly light and crunchy bun. This was a revelation - a perfect balance of salty & sweet and the cheek was braised beautifully and was crazy rich tasting (in the best way possible). Everything was hot, well seasoned and fresh tasting.

The service is quick and friendly, the portion size and the prices are just right, and I can't wait to go back and try some more."}
{"text":"Not very express. Took 20 mins to get a sub. Good flavors but long wait and a bit pricey. Think I'll stick with going to Chinatown or Thai Thai if I want a viet sub."}
{"text":"Everytime I am in Watercress, I am blown away by their food. Thier chicken and shrimp fried-rice is the best fried-rice I have had and their pho hits the spot always. Love the wraps/rolls and banh-mis are yum. A special shout out to their crockery and cutlery if you are eating there. For a carry/express place, I am always impressed by their plating. Dine or carry out or deliver. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A must visit!  We ventured down to 17th Ave SW to check out this restaurant, and were treated to a feast for our senses.  Scrumptious food that was also beautifully presented (pretty AND tasty! see pics).  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Watercress Express and meeting the friendly owner.  The bbq beef rolls and the fried banana and ice cream  desserts were divine. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Tried the steam pork bun. It was tasty; a little on the pricey side but we thought it was worth it. We tried the shrimp papaya salad, grilled pork with spring rolls vermicelli and lemongrass chicken vermicelli bowl. We were both impressed with the quality of the food as it tasted authentic.  We also liked it since it was food court style which we prefer.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We tried this new Vietnamese Place on 17th. There are a number of other Vietnamese places in the area, but they can vary wildly in terms of consistency and service, and generally aren't much for presentation or decor. Watercress is a step above, and gets right what other places get wrong, IMO. 

Very good food. Last couple times had the beef sate pho, and bean curd sub. Isn't too plain jane and isn't too out there, is consistently good. Great presentation. This is the sort of place where you order up at the till up front and your food is brought to you. For that sort of place (with matching price) the food and decor and service was as good as I have had, thus I feel justified in leaving a five star rating. Want to go back lots. 

P.S the bean curd sub is delicious and perfect for a vegetarian who wants to try something new."}
{"text":"Thanks for ruining every other Vietnamese restaurant in the city for me.... sigh."}
{"text":"Kind of in love with this place. Everything is super flavourful and the subs are some of the best viet subs I've  ever had. Love the curly skinny onion \"fries\" they serve with the lemongrass chicken sub -that's my go to but their pork and spring roll vermecelli is pretty damn tasty too. Great addition to 17th!"}
{"text":"Love love the pho here!  The broth was very flavorful and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  Think they use the fresh ones as oppose to the dry ones.  Service was great and prices are comparable to other pho places in the area.  The presentation was impressive and the pork spring rolls were ah-mazing!  A must try for sure!  There's not a lot of pho places that impress me but this one is definitely up there.  Only thing is the bowl shape is a little hard to eat with but other than that 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Stop reading this.

Go to Watercress.

Order the PAD THAI.

Yes, it's a Vietnamese restaurant, but their pad thai is the best I've ever had. They make the tamarind sauce from scratch. The noodles are PERFECT. I couldn't believe how delicious it was, and I love everything, EVERYTHING, I've had at Watercress since the day they opened."}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious! Crispy tofu rolls were really nice and flavorful with a hint of mint inside. The Saté pho sub tofu for beef was unbelievably flavorful. The broth was full of red chilies and lemongrass. The location is a cozy little space with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Vietnamese. My fave food of all time.

We went there the other day for take out and I got salad rolls and the gentleman friend got deep fried wontons.He is OBSESSED with them now and talks about them daily. 

I will say, the vegetarian options weren't great which made me sad. However, the salad rolls (even though they were quite expensive) were delicious. (I had the tofu ones)

This is a good place for appetizers but if you're a vegetarian, not fantastic for meals.

That said, I didn't ask if they could make any of the meals veggie, which now, as I am writing this I am realizing I probably should have and I will next time I go back.

All in all, good food, clean place. Quick service! I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Cafeteria style Vietnamese cuisine but with a creative and even fine dining flare. Ordered the Kim chi fried rice which was delicious. Will order again. Shared with friends the lime chicken rolls, tamarind beef and shrimp rolls, all very good.  Will definitely go back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Above-average Vietnamese food. The restaurant is small and quaint the soups are always hot with fresh ingredients. This is definitely a place for a quick lunch the service is walk up which is kind of a pain, but they do deliver it to your table. Fresh ingredients and unique cuisine make this a go to when you're in a hurry and looking for something different."}
