{"text":"The shawarma was tasteless.  The chef was rude.   I actually had to go to the near by gas station  to buy a candy bar after just so I could confirm my taste buds were still working.

Go to Chef's door instead (either location).

Just to re-iterate.  This place was so bad, I actually made a yelp account in hopes that others won't dare venture here."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING OVERPRICED SLOP!
Can't begin to describe how gross this place is. To top off the horrendous food, a staff member was vomiting violently while we were eating- no doubt due to having eaten at this HELL HOLE

SHOULD'VE ASKED FOR MY MONEY BACK

I'm sure you would have a better meal out of a dumpster"}
{"text":"STAY AWAy!  

Terrible experience.  Grossly overpriced,  poor quality of food and THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!

We ordered a large Shawarma plate that cost $22.95!  Since the chef does not run his rotisseries we had to wait about 25 min for the food to be ready only to find it was mostly rice and a very basic salad (lettuce and tomatoes) topped off with the Shawarma and sauce.   

When compared to the Chef's Door also in Oakville where you get a plate for $11 that has rice, potatoes, nicely appointed salad and meat you cannot even start to compare.   

Worst of all you will feel very uncomfortable in the place, the owner and employees are not friendly AT ALL and you get the distinct feeling they are saying rude things about you in their own language.  I dont know how he stays in business.

 I gave this place a second change but found the experience to be the worst on both occasions."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets bad reviews.  I went in yesterday for a quick bite.  I was looking for some chicken over a salad.  The guy behind the counter made a recommendation, answered all my questions.  The portion for the small salad was quite large.  The amount of chicken they give you is sizeable and the chicken was delicious!  It wasn't dry at all and was seasoned really well. I gave a 4 star and not 5 because I did pay $13 for a small salad which is a little overpriced, even with the amount of chicken they give you.  

I'll be back to try out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"the chicken is rubbery, not many options on the menu.  the place seems dirty and the customer service is non-existent"}
{"text":"Worst Customer service EVER. I was standing waiting to order and the guy had no customers and he didn't ask me How Can I help you, or what can I get you. So I said I'll have beef shawarma, but he didn't proceed to make my shawarma. I asked him if he was going to make it and he said, \"why don't you just f off\"!!! Needless to say I walked out for good. I spoke to other people who said he made them wait an exceptionally long time. Bad Customer service deserves NO Business."}
{"text":"This was literally the worst shawarma I've ever had. It was a joke. Asked for a chicken shawarma and the attached photo is what I actually got. A pile of half burnt half raw chicken and some lettuce. Where I come from that is not even close to a shawarma. Where's the tomatoes? The onions? The turnips? The pickles? Etc. For $8 - do not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Quality is ok at best and they are not always at their best. Service was terrible. Not really much else to say.   2 stars because it's edible in a pinch and I think 1 star should be reserved for inedible only ..."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Terrible food. Terrible people. If there's one word to describe the hole it would be terrible
Head south on 3rd line and eat at chefs door for some real shwrama."}
{"text":"Great customer service and good food. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma. Price is comparatively higher than other places, but I am happy with the portion."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chicken Shawarma /w rice restaurant. It is perfect every time! I recommend a liberal amount of their \"hot\" sauce and garlic sauce to go along with this dish. I have tried their other dishes and they are also very good. It' is a bit on the pricey side though."}
{"text":"This place usually pumps out the best chicken and rice shawarma ever, but on this particular occasion a couple of kids were working the kitchen and the food just wasn't nearly as bang on as it usually is."}
{"text":"I struggle with this place. The food is okay and when there was less shawarma competition I put up with the prices and the rude owner and wife....but no longer. It was so uncomfortable being served I started to send my husband and he didn't want to go. It's expensive and no longer worth it."}
{"text":"Went in with colleagues for lunch, we were all so suprised upon encountering these very very rude people ... didn't understand a word we said so their son  came in to help....plus they were out of beef shawarma which was the whole point of going there in the first place at what I expect was their busiest hour! Very pricey too!"}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch numerous times. The chicken shawarma is what I get and it's always consistent. I don't find the owners rude. They're just getting though it like the rest of us."}
{"text":"I used to love this place.   Over time they have dramatically reduced the portions. 

My pita today super disappointing.   Not how I remember from last year at all. 

Price is definitely not worth what you get anymore.     

Lots of other better shawarma places out there."}
{"text":"Wandered in since extreme pita closed down, I regret NOTHING! Best falafel I've had in Canada for sure. Super crispy with fresh vegetables. The garlic sauce was awesome and they were liberal with it! Just a touch of heat and they served it in foil then put it in a wrap-shaped bag so you don't get sauce on yourself. Genius! It was huge, filling, and fresh. I watched them pour the oil so the falafel were still crispy in the pita. Awesome. 

Will be back when I'm in oakville for sure!"}
{"text":"I really love this place.  I had the chicken pineapple shawarma a few times now ane it is awesomeness on a plate.  The rice that it comes with is fluffy and the sauces are crazy good.  It is on the pricey side, but the portion is huge so it is not bad in value in the end."}
{"text":"Litterly the best Shawarma's ever ,,, during spring my boyfriend worked in oakville and tried this place he loved it then one night after he was done work he brought me here and omg i loved there Shawarmas sooo yummy and i loved there sauces"}
{"text":"I'd say this shawarma is pretty average - meat was good but they went pretty light on the turnips and didn't offer hummus.  It was also poorly wrapped, he warned me it would be messy but literally it ended up pouring down my hair and shirt.  XD"}
{"text":"Listen. Listen. Listen. I not only drove from Michigan to eat here but I'm taking 3x home with me - just because people don't believe me when I talk about this place all year long  #BestHappyBirthdayGift2Me"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, save yourself the trouble and just get the small portion - the large was just too much food for one person! The Shawarma with pineapple was delicious!"}
