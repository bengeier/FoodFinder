{"text":"it's the best food in the entire northeast ohio.  the seared tuna and scallops combo is out of this world."}
{"text":"Without doubt one of the best restaurants in the area. Delicious cuisine, diverse menu, exquisite presentation,  lovely surroundings,  all for a quite reasonable price."}
{"text":"The Tofu Steak is the best prepared tofu I have ever had.  The texture is unlike any other tofu.  Great restaurant; they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Last time I go there! I've been a Wild Mango patron for over a year now. On my first visit I was impressed with how all the food was presented. The food options are fairly neat. I've never had a chicken cheese cake until I tried one here and that dish is why I continued to come back. However, on my last visit my chicken cheesecake was frozen. For starters, I go out do dinner to eat something that isn't just taken out of the freezer and tossed in the microwave or on the stove top. I can do that home thank you very much. Also the service there is just adequate. It would take a miracle to get me to come back to this place."}
{"text":"Started off getting baby calamari, which was amazing, some draft, Chinese beer (even more amazing), and the pesto crusted salmon. Only complaint is that I didn't have enough room for dessert. My server Cassie was very knowledgable and provided excellent service. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 10 times and over all I would say each time has been a good experience.  Not only is the food good, but it is also fun to look at.  Each plate has it's own aesthetic that sets it apart from the rest.  From green mashed potatoes infused with broccoli to hand made desserts topped with sugar sculpture, you never know what you might get.  My favorite is the sesame chicken paired with a cherry Manhattan to drink.  The restaurant itself was designed by the owner and features several unique architectural features that set it apart from anything I have ever seen.  Consider giving this establishment a visit or two, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not from around here but stopped in to order carry out because of the impressive menu & website designs with rather reasonably priced lunch options. My wait was minimal (less than 15 minutes for two entrees- I enjoyed an exquisite ginger soy salmon with the best sweet potato fries I've come across, my better half tried, with much satisfaction, the shrimp linguine with spicy sweet tomato sauce) & the atmosphere was tranquil. For less than $20, we thoroughly enjoyed a very high quality meal at- surprisingly enough - a mall connected restaurant. Thank you for caring for my meal Wild Mango!"}
{"text":"I can't remember how we ever found out about this place seeing that it's squeezed into an increasingly huge and overdeveloped shopping mall, but my friends and family and I have been steady patrons of Wild Mango (formerly Weia Teia) for several years.  I live in the Bay area now, but I almost always come here multiple times whenever I'm home for a visit because it's become a tradition with so many people in my life.  The decor at the new location is a little over the top, but they've preserved my favorite part about the old place with tons of roomy private booths.  It makes up for the fact that the space as a whole feels a bit sprawling and cavernous.  The Asian fusion style food is consistently creative and delicious, while remaining accessible enough for a Nana in her seventies (although not quite accessible enough for a grandpa in his eighties!).  The presentation is the wildest part, and is always really beautiful.  I order the chicken cheese cake 50% of the time even though everything I've had here has been great.  (They took it off the menu for a while but would still make it for me when I asked--now it's back for lunch!)  Other favorites include the romano cheese battered shrimp and the scallops.  The service has also been great and a couple of times I've been lucky enough to be offered a sample of whatever new item the kitchen is testing out at the time.  (I wonder what happened to those pizza shots?)  Finally, a special plug must be given for lunch here.  Dinner can get a bit pricey by west side of Cleveland standards (although definitely not overpriced), but lunch is an amazing value as the portions seem about the same but the prices come down by a third or so.  Plus you get the daily soup included!  It's totally worth fighting the congestion of Great Northern Mall for."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a wonderful experience at Wild Mango for lunch!  The restaurant is beautiful and the food was superb!  We enjoyed our chicken corn soup and especially our main entrees, which were the Sesame Chicken and Romano Shrimp - yum!  We were pleased with the prices too.  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants anywhere. The Shrimp Curry soup is amazing. The mussels are really quite good too. I've tried everything on the menu and I've never had a bad meal. The decor of the place is lovely and service is great. This is a HIDDEN GEM in greater Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I've visited over 6 times, and there's obvious reason I continue to return.  I've had trouble finding decent Chinese food since moving from the east side.  Wild Mango doesn't disappoint with its unique Asian fusion offerings.  Diners young and old will appreciate Wild Mango's private atmosphere.  Yes, as mentioned in other reviews, their lobby is not the most inviting, and I wonder how many are turned off and walk out the door since they can't see in.  The food and service have been stellar on all my visits.  I also like their carry out service, but they really need better take away packaging.  I typically find most of their sauces leaking out the bottom of the bag.  Perhaps they need to use their current Styrofoam boxes, then wrap those in plastic wrap, then bag.  Otherwise they're first rate all around.  Typically I order the Honey -Sesame Glazed Chicken, and every time it's been a very consistent dish.  I also recommend their Chicken Pot Sticker's appetizer."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Kind of hard to find in the Great Northern plaza but well worth it. The decor is really cool, there's a bunch of separate rooms all uniquely decorated. The lunches are my favorite, the chicken cheesecake is a must."}
{"text":"We've been before but this time it was only 3 stars.  My eggplant had way too much cheese.  The tuna was fine but nothing special."}
{"text":"We have eaten here for years going back to when they first opened up before the remodel.  Lunch is a super great value - same dishes as dinner just perfect lunch portions.  My only complaint is consistency - sometimes the chicken can be a tad chewy in the sesame chicken.  Today my spring roll in my Vietnamese Salad Bowl was so soggy it was inedible - it would be better to package them separately so they don't soak up the salad dressing."}
{"text":"So great to have a non-chain restaurant nearby!  We've loved every dish we've ever ordered.  We usually go for lunch as its more reasonable and soup is included.  I get the salmon with mango salsa and sweet potato fries and it's delicious!  The staff are both friendly and professional.  It's a beautiful restaurant to relax and enjoy a great meal!"}
{"text":"One of my clients is based in North Olmsted, so I'm out there a lot, especially at lunch time.  A favorite spot to hit up is Wild Mango.  It's a little piece of trendy, metropolitan, chic dining right smack in the middle of Great Northern Blvd.  The food is great --its Asian inspired cuisine makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  I've only been there for lunch, and that's been enough.  I always enjoy the sesame chicken, chicken cheesecake and the romano shrimp.  But my absolute favorite thing are the sweet potato fries.  They're much more than a \"french fry\" - they're crispy, light and fluffy and the perfect side dish to any of Wild Mango's entrees. And, the most shocking part?  Almost all of the lunch selections are under $10!  Bananas.  If I had one complaint about Wild Mango, it would be that the service can take a bit long sometimes.  It's still good service, just a touch too slow for my liking.  Next time you're at Great Northern Mall or shopping in the area, forgo the the food court or one of the other countless fast food joints.  Instead head to Wild Mango and prepare to have be blown away by deliciousness."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on 3 separate occasions now and have not been disappointed. If not recommended by a relative I would have never given Wild Mango a chance. It so easy to dismiss due to the location next to Sears at the Mall. There is nothing that entices you to come in. Please do not this fool you will be quite surprised as soon as you step in the interior decor makes you forget it is in a Mall. The food presentation is spectacular and food is exquisite. If you like spicy the Szechwan shrimp is amazing. My son loves the Bouillabaisse and the portion is huge, plan on having leftovers of this and the Shrimp Noodle Curry soup is another family favorite of epic portions and for dessert the Creme Brulee is fabulous don't pass it up even if you are full order 1 and share in all it's spectacular spun sugar glory"}
{"text":"Very classy place; kinda tucked away at the mall. Family of six w/ appetizers and drinks came to $102.00. Cheaper than olive garden and the food looks like art. The steak was ok but the shrimp saved the day; will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I are rather sophisticated restaurant diners (I'm from New York, and she's eaten in restaurants all over the world). We live in Minneapolis (not a bad place in itself for excellent restaurants) and travel through the Cleveland area twice a year on visits to her family on Pittsburgh. We found Wild Mango by accident because it was near the motel we're staying at.   We've just had our fourth meal there; we chose it for our fifth anniversary dinner tonight. As in the past, the food was exquisite and the setting a delight. One of the really nice things about Wild Mango is that it's a place which is elegant and at the same time totally comfortable - unlike some high-end restaurants where, in the back of your mind, you're afraid of doing something gauche, we feel totally relaxed there in the beautiful setting. It's one of our favorite places anywhere we've been, and it is, in itself, a reason to stay in North Olmstead on our trip."}
{"text":"Wild Mango is always the restaurant I want to eat at whenever we vist family in Ohio. I taste whatever my husband orders, and it is always tasty, but I absolutely love the Truffle Chicken and order it everytime. Recently, my husband and I went out of our way to go there for my birthday dinner. Upon looking over the menu, to help my husband decide on what he should order, I noticed the Truffle Chicken was not on the menu!  The waitress confirmed that it is no longer available and said a lot of people are asking for it. I am extremely disappointed with this news and no longer look forward to visiting this restaurant until the Truffle Chicken is back on the menu. Also note that the Truffle Chicken is still deceivingly on their online menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat.  Nice ambiance, reasonable prices, and very good food.  I love this restaurant so much that I celebrated my 30th birthday there."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Food and service were excellent. Had 12 of us. Little pricy. We were there for out Brothers funeral and the Funeral home recommended it and we were very pleased."}
{"text":"My mom and I visited for lunch on a saturday afternoon. I didn't know what to expect because they reviews were mixed . We gave it a try anyway and I have to say we were very pleased with our experience. The decor is very elegant and trendy. Our service greeted up promptly with cold glasses of water and lemon. For the appetizer we tried the pepsi shrimp which sounds weird but was very tasty . For entrees I had the sesame chicken and mom the shrimp pasta . We were very surprised before our food arrived the chef sent out complimentary  bowls of corn chowder which was delightful. The entrees were nice portions considering the price $8 for the pasta which came in a nice sized bowl and $7 for the sesame chicken which was served in a fancy three sectioned dish. Overall I really enjoyed the service and the food I would definitely be back for dinner."}
{"text":"I recommend the Pepsi shrimp and chicken pot stickers. A south-east Asia bouillabaisse full of shellfish in a coconut curry broth with vegetables and rice noodles made me weep over its perfection. My husband enjoyed the glazed salmon. Desserts are delicious works of art! Treat yourself!"}
{"text":"the reviews are right, awkward loction...but awesome place!  fresh bread was divine.  the chef's treat was a mushroom cappucino with truffle foam was superb!  i dream of that again!  we had the rib entree for an app.  it is a meal, but who cares!  tender and fell off the bone! yummy for tha tummy  we had shrimp curry- it needed some coconut milk...but it was yummy enough...huge portion!  it will feed you for 3 days!  we also had the vietnamese salad.  it had grilled shrimp n eggrolls in it.  it was alot of food!  holy moly!  love the hot tea presentation!  great waitress....very attentive and helped us make dinner decisions.  thx!  keep up the good work!  pics coming soon..."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise of a restaurant. We went for a weekday lunch with a group of 6 people from work. The ambiance is very nice and made for a celebratory end of year luncheon for the group. I wasn't sure what to expect with the location in the mall - but realized quickly that the food was quality and the service was excellent. Lunch prices were all very reasonable and everyone was pleased with their meals. Desserts were eaten up by us all. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Usually I love this place. But they are INVESTED WITH BUGS! you should not have to keep swatting bugs away WHILE EATING A FANCY DINNER!!! Absolutely horrible!"}
{"text":"I've been here only once, but I enjoyed my meal very much.  The service is great and my mother and I both enjoyed the food.  One thing I enjoyed particularly was the musical selection.  So many nice places blare really annoying music.  But the Wild Mango provided soothing classical music."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than this in Cleveland for this price.  I grew up in Cleveland and now live in California, and during visits to CLE always make it a point to eat at Weia Teia (the original predecessor of Wild Mango). They also sell gift certificates which I just gave to my friends as a nice gift.  The owner is a great guy with an interesting history and experiences as an Asian  chef trained abroad. You MUST try the Duck Breast, then come back for the rest of the menu. Great place to bring a date or friends if you want a place that is unique but that anyone could enjoy (the less adventurous can order something like their burger or a chicken dish). Look at the menu online before you go, because it can be difficult to choose from among the mouth-watering options. Lunches are good and unbelievably low-priced given the quality. Taking everything into consideration I can honestly give this place 5 stars and say that it is on par with anything in its price range that could possibly be found in California/New York etc. Not to mention that it is the most \"novel\" and \"chic\" restaurant to be found so far out on the West Side. The decor looks like a chic Las Vegas hotspot. I give it five stars based on my experiences at dinner on weeknights- I've heard about problems with consistency particularly on busiest nights, but I have never had these problems. If you are not the \"standard\" type of person who would rather play is safe and go to Applebee's with your date, and if you are willing to take a risk in the quest for novelty and discovery, then try this. If you happen to hit it on an \"off\" night, do give it another chance- because it is usually wonderful here. Guys, this is a good place to take a date for ambience without spending a fortune or driving into Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight with my mom. awesome Asian fusion food! First you are served two different dinner rolls with whipped butter. One was honey glazed which I didn't care for only because I am not a sweets type of person. They sent out an amuse bouche compliments of the chef, which was a shrimp with orange and cucumber topping! We both ordered the shrimp bisque with some sort of cilantro oil on top, anyways it was ummmm delish! My dinner consisted of the Asian pesto salmon duo. Both pieces of salmon were properly cooked which I know other yelpers slammed them for overcooking. The flavors were excellent. I think they mixed up where the salmon was supposed to go though. According to the menu the teriyaki salmon was supposed to go with the rice and the pesto with the potato purée, but it was the other way around on my plate. It didn't matter to me though because the flavors were spot on! My mom ordered the Szechwan shrimp which she loved. I tried a bite and thought it could use more spice but I like spicy when called for. I will definitely be back! Awesome food and so many things I want to try on their creative menu!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is an experience.  Not only was each plate a work of art, but each was well-balanced and delicious.  We had an army of servers who took great care of us. Very reasonably priced for the excellent food and service.  Can't wait to share this find with our friends.  Worth the drive from Cuyahoga Falls!"}
{"text":"Been to Mango few times. Every time I go its like an escape to a spa! Its a lunch time secret too as portions/prices are discounted. Dinner Prices are better than expected when taking into account the fancy decor and environment. Food is excellent. I usually get the sesame chicken."}
{"text":"Summary: ok-ish food, sub-standard service, loud, slow.  We went for a family meal on Saturday night.  The front staff was inattentive.  The place was too loud to even listen to our waitress.  She had to lean over the table to hear us.  We ordered a few drinks, they were strong but extremely bland.  They tried to fix one, but came out even worse. We gave up. I don't see the point in the menu advertising exotic flavors, if their bartender couldn't deliver them.  A full hour and a half after ordering, the dishes came out. The sweet potato fries were good.  The curry soup was good.  The scallops were seasoned well and seared nicely.  But the crab risotto was incredibly good.  The seared tuna was not good. The flounder was OK.  The quality of their fish has lots of room to improve.  But the worst part of the experience was seeing how over stretched the waiting staff was.  At no point did they come to check on us, or to tell us the food was taking long. I had to go to the kitchen to see what was going on.  Before that the manager kept doing a round of the tables, but purposefully avoiding eye contact with any table.  He only talked with us at the end of the meal to apologize.  But it would have helped for him to stop by before the damage was done."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.   Firstly, this is probably the most glamorous restaurant interior in North Olmsted, which seems borderline ridiculous since it's surrounded by chain restaurants like Red Lobster and Harry Buffalo. It feels so nice to eat in such a lovely space, void of TVs and loud music.  Secondly, their food is beautifully presented, creative and delicious. My favorite is the Chicken Trio that comes on an elongated plate with three artfully arranged pyramids of different chicken-and-vegetable pairings. Their complementary brioche is a nice perk, and they often bring another complementary mini-appetizer too.  Thirdly, the price for most of the meals is cheap for what you are ordering. I've lived in NYC and Boston so I'm used to exorbitantly priced meals, but at this restaurant you could eat for the same price it would cost at other less than desirable chains.  We've had hit or miss service, but even the \"bad\" service just meant that the food took longer than expected to arrive. The servers are usually very attentive. I try to eat here every time I fly home to visit family."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful celebratory dinner here! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and clean, and has a high end, \"white linen\" feel about it. Prices are reasonable though which makes it all the better! We had Pepsi Shrimp and Calamari to start. I saw a lot of reviews about the Pepsi shrimp but it was just good for me. Not much Pepsi flavor like I expected, I did love the vegetable base it came on. It was tasty overall. The calamari was cooked perfectly and was delightful. The breads were tasty in between these courses. For our mains we had the chicken trio and the duck. The chicken was great and a lot of food. I took about half home. The chicken and peppers was tender and the chicken in the curry sauce was awesome (I loved the sauce). The chicken cheesecake I also saw a lot of people raving about was just ok for me. The chicken was a little dry in it but it was flavorful. My boyfriend loved the duck and its accompaniments, the duck was perfectly cooked and a nice portion. For desert we had a mango cheesecake which had a citrus taste to it and a creme brûlée which was phenomenal. Everything was also beautifully presented. We were very satisfied with our meal and this is definitely on our list of great eats! Parking is easy, a coat check is convenient, and our bill was $75 for 3 courses, plus wine. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Go for the appetizers they are delicious, but beware the sampler is actually four whole appetizers, not a sample of four appetizers!  Stay away from Vietnamese salad, the dressing is watery, Scallops are delish."}
{"text":"I wish I could throw a half star on top of the two I'm giving, but since that can't be done in Yelp!land, two is what's available.    This is a beautifully appointed restaurant, the seating is comfortable and the atmosphere for our lunch was quiet but not stuffy.  Our server was personable and seemed very comfortable in explaining the menu.    I had the duck dish, and while the duck was perfectly cooked, the sweet potato french fries were perfectly forgettable.  They weren't particularly crisp, and I would have enjoyed more of the baby bok choy instead.  The pea soup was amazing!  Beautiful flavor and mouth feel,  I could have had another bowl.  My honey got their version of Pho, and upon tasting their version, know that something better has to be out there.  We ordered the Appetizer Platter to start, and everything was OK, and I mean just OK.  Not terrible, but also not memory inducing.  I was hoping for more flavor from the Pepsi Shrimp, but disappointed.  For dessert we had the creme brulee, aah!  Crunching into the beautiful sugar crust, savoring that first bite of creamy custard, caramelized sugar and fresh berries, Nirvana!    I'm glad we came for lunch, and the price point is very reasonable for daytime dining.  I would come back again, but  this wouldn't be my first stop."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years. Food & service is always good. we usually go on a Saturday for lunch, because that is when they have my niece's favorite soup in the menu. (Dinner is excellent as well!) If you are looking for a restaurant that serves food that you'd see on the Food Network, check this place out. Oh, we recently celebrated my niece's birthday there, & they charged us $15.00 for bringing a birthday cake. Something about competition with their desserts or something."}
{"text":"Great dinner out for my wife and me.  Terrific ambiance, good service, and the food was memorable.   The five vodka Sangria will blow your socks off, if you're wearing them."}
{"text":"Had the best meal I've had in a long time. The presentation was beautiful so much so you just wanted to just take it all in. The service was great"}
{"text":"Strike 2 on this trip!  Came here around 7:30 and sat in the bar for dinner. The only person in the bar was the one of 2 bartenders, and he walked to the back as soon as I got here and didn't return for 10min. Finally, the second bartender came into the room long enough for me to place my order for the soup of the day (split pea with sea scallops) and a Caesar salad. When the soup arrived, it smelled great!  Unfortunately, there was not a single bit of scallop OR PEA (!!!) to be found in my bowl of broth. Also, as the waiter delivered the soup he was kind enough to inform me that they were out of Caesar salad (no romain lettuce). C'mon... It was only 7:30!  The spinach salad was decent, but a little sweet for my taste. After it was all said and done, there was not a single apology or acknowledgement of the poor dining experience. Overall, a disappointing dinner and the only time I will eat here."}
{"text":"I was in town for my sister's graduation, and my family needed a place to go out to lunch before they took me to the airport and drove home. I looked for something in the area and came up with this place. Being from Chicago, I wasn't expecting much for a two $$ restaurant in a suburb of Cleveland, but the rating on Yelp was promising so we went.  The location is a bit odd; it's tucked in next to a Sears in a standard Midwestern mall. This seemed to confirm my suspicion that this wouldn't be anything much.  As soon as we walked in, my sister and I thought I had accidentally picked somewhere much more expensive and nicer. Once we sat down and saw the prices on the menu, we were totally amazed! After years of Chicago prices, I was surprised to see that it was between $8-15 per plate.  My family split the appetizer sampler, which was amazing. I loved the tuna tartar, and the calamari was only lightly battered and fried. My more conservative parents said the pepsi-battered shrimp were their favorite part.  I ordered a Thai Basil Bliss cocktail, which was very sweet and refreshing, and my father got the mango iced tea, which was also good.  The lunch was fantastic, and the plating for everything was beautiful. It was truly a work of art. We each got something different so we could try everything. We had the scallops with crab risotto and mushrooms, soy-glazed salmon with mango salsa, chicken cheesecake, and the shrimp with spinach. Everything but the risotto came with really great sweet potato fries; they had the same batter as what was on the calamari, which was very light and not overdone.   The only complaint I might have was that the scallop dish only came with three rather small scallops, but for $9 I was willing to overlook that.  Altogether the meal was $77 plus tip for the shared appetizer, four entrees, a pop, and one cocktail for four people.  Service was good from start to finish. We were some of the only people in the restaurant at 1:00 on a Sunday afternoon so it was very quiet and we were able to talk.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone in the area. It was a great experience and was definitely on par with some of the nicer restaurants I've tried in Chicago but without the gigantic price tag!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Had the vegetarian eggplant entree and it was amazing. Really hit the spot, and great service!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Fancy decor. Impressive entry way. Nice looking wine selection. Good reviews, but don't listen to them. The music was sad, the wait staff, apathetic and the food was tasteless.  This only fusion going on is bad food being served in a fancy place."}
{"text":"Hands-down my favorite restaurant. Love everything about this place. The food is out of this world - almost too beautiful to eat, but that would be a crime, because it is delicious! One favorite is the shrimp curry noodle soup; the broth is superb. Husband is a huge fan of the bouillabaisse, also with an exquisite broth. We've had steaks, scallops, salmon, and chicken cheesecake - all wonderful. Risotto sides are perfect. Decor is lovely and comfortable. Wish I were going there tonight!"}
{"text":"i've held off on my review of wild mango because i was trying to make up my mind about the place. i haven't come to any conclusions, so i'm going to state the facts of my experience and let you take the pieces and make a whole.   i was there about a month ago with a large party. it was a non-peak time, sunday night, so it wasn't very crowded. i had heard about the new wild mango location but hadn't ventured over yet. walking through the doors, i realized the place was redone much more upscale than the old location.   when you walk in the doors, you're greeted by a hostess in a small waiting room separate from the lounge and dining area. in fact, the entire restaurant is very compartmentalized. if you're not an advocate of smaller spaces and prefer the wide open spaces (dixie chic), then this is not your place. but if you *do* like that kind of space, and an elaborately decorated one at that, this is your place. wild mango takes it's asian fusion theme and mixes it with a modern interior design. the small, posh cocktail lounge is off to the left of the entrance, and is cozy and intimate enough to enjoy a couple of drinks with a date in a swank setting. you kind of forget you're in north olmsted.   once through the dining area's doors, to your right is an area for larger parties and to your left are smaller booths for couples. i think this is a *great* idea. if you're on a date trying to impress an insignificant other, the last thing you need is little billy shouting \"NO MOMMY I WANT FRIED RICE AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY!!!\"   ambiance= 10. no matter what category in which you fall. but i will say this: they hadn't dusted their lighting fixtures. call me picky. i do.   with our large group i had the opportunity to try or see much of the menu. i ordered the chicken trio. the chicken cheese cake was devoured by all that ordered it in a matter of minutes. that's some tasty treats. the name? not so appealing. but the taste? delicious. and no, it's not a cheesecake dessert.   several others at the table ordered the surf and turf, roasted duck, and shrimp. no matter what the order was the food was delivered with the most elaborate presentation i've seen in cleveland. it's some beautifully displayed food. i'm just sayin'. you almost feel bad tearing into it, it's so attractive.   where wild mango loses me a bit is the flavor. it's good- don't get me wrong. but with the atmosphere, the presentation, and the posh attitude, i want the taste a step above where it is. it's good. but it's not amazing.   i guess i'm also a bit put off on the asian fusion idea of creating a menu. i think i'm an all or nothing type gal. if you want to be an asian food menu, be it. if you want to be generic, be generic. this in between design is confusing me. in other markets, i think the asian fusion idea is over saturated and overdone. here in cleveland it's not done much, so wild mango is in a class by itself.   it's in a class by itself anyway, since it really is a better dining experience than so many places here in the city. i'd recommend for a night out with a date, a gathering with family, or for travellers looking for somewhere interesting in the neighborhood to eat."}
{"text":"I have been here for dinner a few times. Mostly I come here to sit at the bar and order apps. I lived in North Olmsted for years, so this is how I stumbled upon this place. I really do enjoy their selection and scenery. I think their drinks are made well and the service really is very good.  I would recommend the salmon for dinner. Not only is the presentation exceptional, the dish itself is well planned and executed. The pasta dishes are good for an asian inspired restaurant. I like the thinly sliced chicken included in most of these dishes. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"In the mall parking lot w/ a variety of other restaurants, Wild Mango stands out amongst the rest. Very disappointed in the quality of food in this area of Cleveland & even got food poisoning.  Wild Mangos food was fresh & delish!    Upon entering, the hostess stand & the inside entrance door are awkward & I'm sure gets packed.  Great ambience once inside of the restaurant, nice cocktail list, delish mango iced tea & service was also fantastic!    For lunch, they serve a nice green pistachio type of soup, except they should leave the bland chicken out.  Maybe add almond slivers cause the chicken reminded me of the pre-made chunks from the store.  Vietnamese Salad was healthy, fulfilling, layered w/ grilled Shrimp, mixed greens & buried under was the vermicelli noodles & it was garnished w/ halved pork egg rolls.  Some pieces of the mixed greens were wilted.  If you order this tail-off the shrimp first & thoroughly mix the salad up so you get the vermicelli & sauce all mixed in.    Out of all the restaurants this was the best & if I'm ever in the area again, I will be back!  The menu is fantastic & unique, along w/ the presentation."}
{"text":"It was one of the best restaurants I have been to in awhile. Walking in at 6:00 pm on a Friday night no reservations 3 people, with no wait! The ambience was relaxing. I was very impressed with how well the waiter knew the menu. Everything was cooked to perfection including my sea scallops. Everything was lovely. Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for six of us. When we arrived on time we waited 20 minutes and then they gave our table to somebody else. So we waited another 10 minutes, and when we were ready to walk out they seated us. Service was good, and food was okay, that's why they get three stars. They need some help at the front desk."}
{"text":"In terms of the service... it was actually kind of bad.  They took forever to get us drinks and even consider asking for our order.. Bleh.  The food was merely alright in terms of the taste-- certain appetizers blew me away, but main dishes are just okay... the presentation was AMAZING and beautiful though.  The bill came to be way too much for what we got though..."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places. Nice atmosphere. Nice mango tea. Complimentary soup at lunch, and I am talking split pea with scallops, not just miso.  I love the crab risotto with scallops. It is rich and decadent and priced so wonderfully at lunch especially. This is perhaps the best thing you can buy for under $10 in Cleveland (or at least one of the best with apologies to Steve's Gyro and some Noodlecat items and maybe that awesome food truck at Dean's Food Supply).  My favorite thing here is the tuna tartar. It is a little pricey but man it is so fresh and delicious with just the perfect dice and that quail egg sets it off.  The molten cake dessert is a little better than other places and the fresh fruit and compote that comes with it is an unusually perfect compliment to the vanilla ice cream and cake. It is one of the only places that I have been that fruit and chocolate work together for me."}
{"text":"The location I agree is weird but once you go inside the world as you know it no longer exist from the inside you could be anywhere in the world and it wouldn't matter once the experience begins.   Starting at the door the service is some of the best anywhere in the area This place is clean and the layout provides so many options very accommodating   Okay on to the food 1st - fresh bread and butter 2nd - the tuna tar tar some of the best I've had and I live in Florida  3rd - the beef carpaccio yummy  Now it's time to eat I had the shrimp pasta with linguini and fresh spinach and   grated cheese not the best choice I've ever made here but not bad and I need to try new things  My daughter ordered the Asian Shrimp Curry and Noodles Wow is it good and the bowl could feed at least two people we took it with us  I drank the mango tea and she had water  Check please wow all of this under $60.00  Treat yourself to some culture and visit this place"}
{"text":"It is Asian fusion and bold--be prepared for heavy cream and guilt. Go there for lunch for the best prices and bang for your buck. You will not be disappointed. I know, I know. It is part of a mall. You wouldn't know it once you get inside."}
{"text":"Great lunch and dinner! The lunch menu has great prices and comes with soup. My favorite dinner dish is the chicken with green beans. Portion is large and delicious!"}
{"text":"It makes me very sad to give a 2 star review because food-wise, Wild Mango is actually my favorite restaurant in the area but I've had enough. The service here is just consistently way too terrible to give it more than 2 stars. I have been to Wild Mango countless times over the past 8 years for both dinner and lunch and literally every time have received the worst service. During my most recent visit this past Saturday for lunch- first off we walk in and there is just no hostess. We had to wait at the front for a good 5-7 minutes before just locating a staff member to find the hostess to be seated. Once our server finally comes to our table, he doesn't greet us or introduce himself at all. We put our order in immediately. We get our appetizer 15 mins later by a different guy then it is literally 60 mins later that we finally get our food and see our waiter for the first time since we placed the order. It was ridiculous. The restaurant wasn't even busy. There was no acknowledgement from the staff that we had just waited over an hour for our food. We quickly ate and then looked for our waiter to get the bill but couldn't find him. I actually got up to find another staff member to get our waiter and couldn't even find anyone to do that. We eventually go the bill after waiting another ~25 mins and left immediately. Our lunch took over 2 hours.  On another occasion, we went for my mom's birthday dinner and also waited forever to get our food. They brought the food out after over an hour and my mom's filet was completely uncooked. She sent it back to the kitchen. The server didn't apologize at all. The rest of the table tried waiting for her to get the steak back but eventually started eating. She didn't get her steak back for another 45 mins and it was still medium rare (she wanted it well done). Long story short, our bill was over $300, they didn't apologize or even remove my mom's dinner from the bill (even after my dad complained), and our dinner took close to 3 hours.  Although the food is great, it is NOT worth the quality of service you receive, the EXTREME wait times, and the complete lack of customer service."}
{"text":"We frequent wild mango quite often and are never disappointed. The food is incredible along with the presentation. The prices are EXTREMELY affordable. I've gotten a ton of different things on the menu but LOVE the ginger soy salmon. It's amazing. Their Cesar salad is also delicious and their desserts are amazing!!! Sue was the best server we ever had, she sold me item after item because she made everything sound so good! We were stuffed and once she explained the desserts we had to get them. Try it! You won't be disappointed! Also a great place for large parties!"}
{"text":"Awesome , hadn't been in a while didn't disappoint!!! Ramano Shrimp was great , mom had chicken cheese cake and daughter had chicken linguine, all perfect !!! Oh and the pea scallops soup to die for ! We also had calamari and potstickers for appetizer, yummy !!! We'll be back , sooner than later !!!"}
{"text":"I met  a  friend  for  lunch on Tuesday  and I can't  stop thinking  about  how great  the food  was at this  restaurant .   Began with pot stickers  which were  delicious .   We then had the chicken cheese cake which was outstanding !   One of the most unusual  dishes  I have ever had.  It was delicious .  The presentation  of the chicken cheese cake and the sweet potato  fries was an elegant  piece of art .  The fries tasted more like they had been baked; there was real flavor  and  good  texture .  Overall  a delightful  experience .   Service  was attentive.  Cozy  environment  and well  decorated ."}
{"text":"It is a great treat to go to Wild Mango for lunch.  The lunch prices are a great deal, and you get the soup of the day complimentary.  I appreciate that they also have a separate vegetarian menu as well.  My husband's favorite dish is the Grilled New York Strip Steak (but substitutes mashed potatoes for the sweet potato fries), and I enjoy the Curry Noodle Soup (you get so much, there are definitely leftovers)."}
{"text":"Service time has gotten exceptionally better this has become one of my absolute favourite restaurants in the area the bread is amazing and fresh the food never has disappointed me, it's a great place to eat and they open at 11am instead of 4pm like a lot of places do. A+++"}
{"text":"Food was great and so were the drinks. Sat at the bar and was the only person there so it was nice, but kinda weird since I had my own personal room. Bartender was nice, service was quick, so nothing to complain about.   I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I just find it okay.  The most recent outing was on a weeknight to celebrate a birthday.  I wish I would have chosen somewhere else.  We arrived at the restaurant around 7:00 and didn't get out of there until almost 9!   Our service was flat out terrible.  It took almost 10 minutes for our server just to get our drinks.  She had one other table from what we could tell.  The food was good but they overcooked my boyfriend's steak which they immediately took back but by the time they brought it out again I was halfway done.   I've since heard from friends that going for lunch is better.  It's cheaper for the same food.  I probably won't head there for dinner again. I can find better service at other places that have food just as good and at better prices."}
{"text":"Wow, I really didn't expect to find a place like this in North Olmsted of all places, but I saw the positive reviews on Yelp so I wanted to check it out.  A big plus is that it is pretty much right next door to my church, Sovereign Grace Church in North Olmsted, so now we have a place where we can visit that is not a chain restaurant after church.  So the first thing you notice is how elegant this place looks.  Definitely has a high class feel to it, like you're entering some fancy Vegas private lounge or something like that.  A little out of place in North Olmsted, but I really enjoyed it.  Don't miss the lovely glass artwork that is hanging from the ceiling in the front entrance.  The Wife and I sat in the area with dark colored booths, very private and intimate.  Our waitress was friendly and professional.  Menus are on these interesting wooden boards which are a little unwieldy but certainly interesting to handle.  We ordered the Surf and Turf ($13) and the chicken cheesecake ($7).  To our surprise and delight, they gave us each complimentary pea and scallop soup.  It was delicious and smooth, we loved it and would consider ordering it by itself.  We loved that the sweet potato fries were cut in thick chunks and really enjoyed the creative plating of the items.  The garlic spinach that was served with the Surf and Turf was fantastic, cooked perfectly- I'm a little picky about that.  There were three shrimp- wouldn't have minded if there were more because they were really delicious.    Chicken cheese cake was like a warm, crusty, chicken salad with cheese in it.  Sounds strange but pretty tasty.   It was plated gorgeously.  We had room for dessert so we got the creme brulee.  What a fun dish- topped with gorgeous filigreed sugar wires with a side of berries and a drizzled sauce.  It was almost a shame to eat it, but we joyfully did.  Really snazzy presentation.  I really enjoyed Wild Mango- it is the kind of place that I would take out of town guests, especially at lunch time when the prices are very reasonable for what you get.    btw, their bathrooms are gorgeous.  Worth taking a look at!"}
{"text":"Pricey but so classy and very good food!   The menu is very unique and everyone I went with loved their food. This is the go-to place for us to take clients from out of town. The presentation is amazing and the whole experience is great."}
{"text":"If you want a delicious lunch with a fancier ambiance that still has a reasonable price, this is your place. I have been here a few times and I am always impressed with the quality of food for the price. Even the presentation makes you feel like you are dining not just grabbing a quick lunch. I have never been for dinner but I imagine it is just as good!   They start you off with some complimentary soup if you order an entrée, huge bonus! Some recommendations:  The Pesto Salmon: the sauce is so good and the salmon is cooked perfectly! The scallops: you get 4 huge scallops for $9 with risotto on the side... NINE dollars! The sesame chicken: an upscale version of the Chinese takeout kind so obviously delicious  This is a great place to come if you are out and about around great northern or in the area and want something more than food court food or chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm still madly in love with this place. Tonight we came for my birthday dinner. The French pear martini was very strong...And not in a good way. My husband's espresso martini was delicious! We had the Pepsi shrimp as an appetizer which we both enjoyed. I had the chicken trio but asked for only chicken cheesecake so they gave me two. Aaaaamazing! Love the chicken cheesecake! My husband got the bouillabaisse. Holy crap the portion was huge! It could have been shared. My husband gobbled it right up. I had the 14 layer chocolate cake for dessert and my husband had the Creme brulee. Yum! Service was good and we will certainly make the 50 minute drive back!"}
{"text":"Wild Mango is right on that perfect border between \"experimental\" and \"not frickin' crazy.\"  I mean, there are restaurants where their idea of \"crazy\" food is putting both ketchup AND mustard on the burger, and there are deranged places that combine seared rabbit ear and snail intestines just because they can.   Wild Mango, however, mixes up East and West in nice ways, with strange combinations like Pepsi and fried shrimp, or pesto chicken with a sharp and tangy Asian sauce.  It's one of the most entertaining menus I've seen, complete with a surprise amuse-bouche that varies from night to night.  And who doesn't like to say \"amuse bouche\"?  Everything I've had has been at the least tasty, and gorgeously presented.  I see on the other reviews that there are those who have not been impressed by the plating, but I can only suspect that either a) WIld Mango was having an off night, or b) their usual main course is fricaseed crack, because I took out my iPhone and sent photos of my meals to all my friends, who oohed and aahed.  The chocolate cake dessert in particularly beautiful, like some sort of structural candy bridge (even if the cake itself was a little dry).    Also, the room is just plain gorgeous, and segmented into tiny alcoves so you can have a quiet conversation and feel intimate.    In short, this is one of my favorite places in Cleveland.  There are those who are complaining that this isn't as good as the restaurant it USED to be, which may be legitimate - but if so, that restaurant was the pinnacle of restaurantdom.  This?  Is still pretty damned good."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night and was very impressed.   The restaurant is somewhat small but very high quality food and service with an  opulent decor.  The food includes some very creative and unusual combinations.  It seems like a combination of Thai, Vietnamese, French and Italian food.  It's not at all what you'd expect from a restaurant attached to the mall.  Each menu is pasted to a very long thin plank - like the blade of a ceiling fan.  Kind of cool but they get unwieldy and irritating after awhile.  Most of the tables are lined up next to each other with a chair on one side and a long cushioned bench along the wall.  They are uncomfortably close.  There are a few more private tables for larger parties.    The food is excellent.  The calamari appetizer was the best I've ever had.  The shrimp bisque had a good flavor but was very thin and difficult to eat with the smallish soup spoons.  The salmon duo entree was excellent.   Portions were very generous, to the point of being overwhelming.  A diner right next to us had the bouillabaisse.  The bowl was huge - like a mixing bowl.  The creme brulee and tiramisu were also very good.  Rolls were homemade but were dry and tasteless.  With such big portions, it's surprising that two diners need to share one small ball of extra-sweet butter.  The service and staff were excellent.    It's definitely not a family restaurant but I'd return with a group of adults for a special occasion.  Due to the seating arrangement, it's not a great place for couples.  I don't like sitting right next to other diners - especially when you are paying so much.  You can hear every word they say and they hear every word you say.  That would be the only thing that would keep me from coming back and it's the main reason I can't give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great service, Beautifully displayed food, food is good, great lunch deals!"}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of this restaurant since they were Weia Teia.  Their menu changed quite a bit at the beginning of the business, but they seemed to have steadied their menu offerings now.  The mai tai's and tuna tar tars are a must.  The mai tais are quite sweet with the right mixture of alcohols.  The appetizer combines the perfect texture, taste, and essence.  It is presented in a wonderful bowl with a pesto-like design surrounding the tar tar.  It has a delightful crunch coating on top of the tar tar with a sunny side up quail egg and served with the sweetest mango salsa.  The surf and turf is quite good with a delectable sauce and romano shrimp.  The romano shrimp and sweet potato fries are heavenly, satisfying any savory cravings.  The thai curry salmon is very good as well, the sauce is just perfect, not to spicy and not to bland.  However, the spinach preparation is not quite up to par with the rest of the dish.  Don't miss the thai curry shrimp soup either!  My sister seems to be in love with the Chocolate Triangle cake; however, it is not the best I've ever had.  When available, try to ask for the espresso ice cream!  However, last time I was there; they told me they no longer made the espresso ice cream.  The best server there is Melvin by far; he has also been one of the longest employees there."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. The food is amazing. You can tell the Chef takes pride in his work. We haven't had bad meal/dish yet and we've visited many times. My favorite is the pot stickers and the sweet potato fries, trust me they are that good!"}
{"text":"I went there for a dinner and totally disappointed with food .i ordered teriyaki shrimp it was too sweet and the rice was too sticky to eat . I mentioned the details to the waitress and she offered me two option . 1. Bag the rest of the food . 2. Order something else . Frankly, i had bad food experiences  with other restaurants too and they will usually have some one who hear customer's input . I didn't really felt that my concerns were really heard and I have been rushed through the entire fiasco.  It almost felt like I should bag my food and get out of there .  Think! When your customer is conveying you that she/he really didn't like the dish , why would you want to offer bag rest of the food ; what does that tell about yourself to your customer ?  If you really care about your customer , would you want to send the customer with food that she/he doesn't want to eat at the first place .For a restaurant that charges a premium I expect a better food quality and definitely a better attitude towards the customer.  When somebody is having a bad time , please take a better approach ."}
{"text":"I have been to Wild Mango many times and it is always a nice experience. My mom and I went tonight and enjoyed a delicious meal and stellar service. I had my usual, the coconut curry tofu soup, which is giant portion for only $8. I am gluten free and I love that this dish is suitable. I had tons to bring home even after filling my belly at dinner. The staff was very professional, the food came out quickly and we left very happy."}
{"text":"Wild Mango is around 45 minutes from where I live but it is always worth the trip. Definitely one of my favorite places. The food is always presented beautifully, along with the desserts that look like they belong in an art exhibit. The atmosphere of Wild Mango is creative and unique as well."}
{"text":"I got the Japanese Eggplant appetizer and the cheese was chewy. The flourless-chocolate cake was amazing, though"}
{"text":"Classy establishment. Food presentation is top notch & drink selection is excellent. The only downfall is that the waitstaff is a bit stiff. A good place to go on a date."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a random night due to a friend's recommendation. After having an incredible amount of asian food growing up, I have to say this is not bad for an American-Asian fusion place.  Ordered an Tuna appetizer, which was decent in size. You can even share it with another person. It was an very interesting mix of tuna and fruits. Although I am not a big fan of raw tuna, this dish did catch my attention. Would definitely order again if I go back.  As for main course, we ordered a roasted duck and a salmon duo. The duck was okay because it had fatty skin/mean to it. The sauce wasn't anything too special. But if you like duck no matter how it's made, you will probably enjoy this dish. The salmon duo was definitely a good choice since both of us really liked it. Although the one of the 2 slices of salmon was slightly dry, the sauce definitely made it much better.  The dish comes with a teriyaki sauce and thai curry sauce. They are very different in contrast, but it was a good duo for the meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on a Saturday night recently and although they had a rather large party that planted themselves in the restaurant for over 4 hours, the long wait was made up for by the amazing food.    The great: Food, Waiter, Owner  We ordered the chicken trio and honey sesame chicken.  Both were delicious with beautiful presentations for a very reasonable price.  Our waiter was great, he got triple sat at one time and handled it well.  The Owner is constantly walking around and accessible.  He came to our table and checked on our satisfaction, very classy in this day and age.    The just ok:  Not a big fan of the extremely close seating in the place, but many places do this.  The bartenders seemed to both be very new with a lot of confusion behind the bar, but both were friendly so no big deal.    Overall this place is great.  A great value with outstanding food."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to favorites!  I always get the duo salmon and it never disappoints! I don't know which one I love more, the pesto or the teriyaki!  The Pepsi shrimp is the best too!  But even better then the food tonight was our sweet server Melissa.  She was delightful! So helpful and so pleasant!"}
{"text":"I live in Southern CA and am \"home\" in Cleveland visiting family.  My cousins and I (party of 10) spent a fabulous evening at Wild Mango last night...half of our group had been here before & loved it and I'm certain we'd all return happily! The ambiance is great...bold colors, fancy/upscale yet very comfortable. We had reservations & were delighted when they put us in a private \"nook\" which was half table half booth (the booth side having beautiful jeweled pillows- so it was more like being on a sofa - very inviting.) We enjoyed our starters...calamari and a sashimi plate - which practically melted in my mouth. 10 people - 10 different main course selections...we all enjoyed them...their food has beautiful & artisitic presentation..and unlike many trendy & upscale restaurants the portions are quite plentiful. I had the asian salmon duo - 2 nice size pieces of salmon - 1 with a japanese flair  that was bursting with flavor & the other with a Thai pesto on rice with a cocunut curry sauce, accompanied by asian veggies...it was a FAB choice! Others in our group had  & really enjoyed: the spicy duck, szechuan shrimp (with an awesome aroma!) , ahi tuna w/mango rice, and a chicken trio plate that features their \"chicken cheesecake\" which my cousin said rocked ! To finish things off, we shared a - very generous - serving of their homemade coconut ice cream...which we all loved...the flavor was so amazing!   I look forward to returning to Wild Mango when I'm visiting again...and as for pricing...well, I live in Southern CA so I thought the prices were excellent...you wouldn't get that quality dining experience in Southern CA for those prices. Overall...Wild Mango a HUGE hit for the Cleveland food scene."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times - and have been at their Oberlin location too. Great, friendly service. Lovely selection of what I consider to be Asian fusion. Beautiful decor.  Comfy. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"For me, Wild Mango was more for the experience than the food.  The decor was awesome and the seats were very comfortable.  I ordered the Honey-Sesame Glazed Chicken and my fiance ordered the Shrimp and Linguine  with a simple salad.  The chilled shrimp w/ orange starter was tasty as well as the rolls.  The presentation of the food was very artistic (that's what edged my rating to 4 starts).  The food was good, but not amazing.  Dessert was pretty good also.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This is my 82 year old mother's favorite restaurant! She is one of the best cooks I know and you can trust her judgement. I'm trying to figure out which restaurant you naysayers and bestowers of one star went to?! We've been for lunch at least 4 times (the best bargain in the state) and dinner a couple of times in the past year and have never had a bad meal! We always get the appetizer assortment for 4 - pepsi shrimp, chicken potstickers, calamari, and tuna tartar- because we wouldn't want to miss any of these yummy starters. Don't expect to taste the Pepsi, it adds a hint of sweetness and some bubbles to the batter! The shrimp, however, are succulent and that's what I want to taste. We've pretty much run the menu and the seafood is all delicious, the sesame chicken and BBQ ribs are standouts, the steaks are flavorful, and the pastas are lovely. Some items are very rich, including the chicken cheesecake and the risottos. So don't force it down and take some home! I find they treat their vegetables with respect. They keep it pretty simple, don't overcook, and let the flavors shine. I don't think anything comes out of the freezer here. The presentation is flawless, the service attentive and formal and the desserts will knock your socks off. Where in Cleveland do you get such beautiful and delicious sweets? Spun sugar and blown sugar decorations are on all of them. This is east coast quality at midwest prices. And the best part? Even if you show up in jeans, they make you feel welcome and special. Or maybe they just recognize us after so many visits.  Go for lunch. Try it out. The portions are a bit smaller. The prices are a lot smaller and you'll find out if you like their style. All 3 generations in this family, including the picky eaters, are fans of Jia Wei's beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"1/1 star - clean and great looking place.  Tables and seats were clean.  Plating used were unique and added lots of character to the restaurant.  1/1 star - service was good.  Food came out in a timely fashion and food was at a perfect temperature.  Main entrees arrived together so no one was left staring at someone else eating.  3/3 star - Review on Crab Cake, Grilled Strip Steak, and Asian Salmon Duo.  Crab Cake - This was a delicious crab cake that include a mixture of crab and small bits of veggie, however, it did not lose the crab flavor.  Served on a bed or arugula, it was well complimented with their sauce.  Excellent presentation.  Grilled Strip Steak -the cut of steak was okay, but the flavor was there.  With a side of the mixed stir-fry  veggies in a dark sauce (not crappy steamed stuff) and very well done sweet potato fries in an edible wrap, this dish as a whole was very well done.  Asian Salmon Duo - This dish was just gorgeous...  I didn't want to eat it!  When I finally got the courage to destroy it, it was so good.  A sweet Asian glaze on one side and Pesto on the other, separated by a wall of stir-fry mix veggies in a white sauce, this dish is made to take your breath away by looks and by taste.  Only downside was too much rice under the Pesto Salmon, by that is hardly a problem.  I definitely recommend this place for dining and impressing family or colleagues."}
{"text":"I don't get why so many people love this place. It looks fancy and acts fancy, but the food quality is mediocre at best. The brioche from the bread basket was dry and tasteless. The shrimp romano is served in an artistic pile beneath some spinach leaves that had been doused in a bland and quickly heated and atop some very unsatisfying and surprisingly, breaded, sweet potato fries. The fries were gross, the shrimp was ok, and the spinach was weird. Also, the amuse bouche (mushroom soup in a shotglass topped with white truffle foam) was unbalanced. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by my boyfriend with a dinner at Wild Mango three weeks ago and I'm still dreaming about the evening! I knew he was taking me somewhere fairly nice, but when I walked through the door into the grand entranceway, I just looked at my man with the widest eyes, hoping I was dressed up enough! Thankfully it turns out that I was; somehow Wild Mango manages to pull off an incredibly beautiful and grand dining environment and still allow you to feel quite comfortable.   When we sat down to look at our menus, I found myself reading off all the options with delighted intrigue. I had the hardest time choosing my entree, as every dish was uniquely tempting! My date just laughed at my indecision, promising that we would return to try more options. I finally picked the Asian Salmon Duo, and he went with the Five-Spiced Roast Duck.  Our lovely waitress first brought out two tiny amuse bouches...and the were liquid pizza! That's right, I kind of scrunched my brow a little in concern as well...but after one sip, my boyfriend and I looked at each other with total awe...it totally tasted like the best pizza! Wow!   The bread that followed was the bread of my dreams, two different rolls that were soft and a little sweet, both of them just melted in your mouth with their sweetened butter spread atop each piece.  As an appetizer, we ordered potstickers, and my oh my were they delightful. Just the perfect hint of crispy on the outside, and very tender and flavorful on the inside. Just as we finished up our plate, out came our entrees, and for a moment all I could do was stare in wide-eyed wonder. My plate of salmon was presented in the most beautiful fashion, I'll just let my photo speak for itself!   It was now time to dig in, and at this point in the experience, I was expecting nothing but the best. I flaked off a piece of the most tender salmon, gathered a little bit of the rice and sweet curry sauce underneath, and with that first bite it was sealed: Wild Mango had landed itself into my top 5 favorite places ever. The other side of my salmon duo was just as excellent, salmon over mashed potatoes with a teriyaki sauce. Both filets were cooked to perfection, and paired wonderfully with the simple and light assortment of veggies in the middle. My boyfriend's duck was also prepared excellently, though we both agreed my dish of choice won the night, and couldn't believe it was only a $20 dish for how generous and incredible it was!  But the experience wasn't over yet. Since everything had exceeded our expectations at that point, we knew we had to check out the dessert menu. Indeed, it was full of hopelessly tempting offerings, such as mango cheesecake, creme brûlée, tiramisu, and a seven layer chocolate cake with raspberry. We agreed upon a cake which I suddenly can't remember the name of, but which consisted of many layers, including kahlua soaked cake, chocolate ganache, and some sort of cream. It also had an assortment of berries on the side, which paired quite perfectly. That cake was quite possibly the best dessert I've ever had at a restaurant! All too often the dessert menu is a predictable and boring afterthought. Not at Wild Mango!  After our last plate had been taken away, my boyfriend and I just stared across the table at one other for a moment, delighting in the experience and savoring its last moments. But we will return, oh we will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time and the food was absolutely amazing! The service was  excellent! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Preface: Company trip, co-workers only trust chain restaurants, only 1 hour to eat before flight   Tantalizing.   Like I mentioned in the preface, this was our first Cleveland restaurant that wasn't a major chain. We had 45 mins total to eat/pay our bill/leave before having to catch our flight @Hopkins International. We phoned ahead to pre-order, the hostess (Taylor) checked with the manager but was unable to accept a phone pre-order. We decided to still head over since Wild Mango had been recommended twice!   Food: mouthwatering, Asian fusion with a gourmet twist. As soon as we were seated the waitress brought us a choice of baguette twist or brioche bread. The brioche was better than the baguette twist, but with a hint of sweetness I didn't love. Immediately following the bread service was a one-bite sample of a shrimp & pesto mince....it was an AMAZING medley of flavors in my mouth!   I ordered the Surf & Turf ($38) which was perfection!! My same-plate side dishes were whipped potatoes (yummy) which acted as a stage for 4 or 5 panko-breaded shrimp drizzled with spicy mayo (exquisite), vegetable medley as a bed for the sole sea scallop (the scallop was unbelievable), and frites wrapped in a tempura sleeve (meh, nothing special). The steak (which seemed to be around 6-8oz was IMPECCABLE!!!! Toasty and charred on the outside with a warm, red, tender center.   One of my colleagues had honey-sesame glazed chicken (tasted like run-of-the-mill sesame chicken), it was left half-eaten. The other colleague had teriyaki chicken flanked by two triangles of white rice and it was above par with a smokey, grilled flavor!  Ambiance: the marble columns and nice finishes fits nicely with the air of sophistication in this place. Very accommodating staff who are very professional.   Attire: most guests were dressed in business casual to dressy attire.   Price: between $15-40 per plate.   Overall: try it out, you won't regret it!!   P.s. The staff helped us get in and out the door within 45 minutes and we caught our flight!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is interesting.  The good: It's different. The asian/fusion food is fun. It's a good date place or with a small group. I recommend asking for a booth table in one of the smaller rooms. The menu is limited, which I'm always a fan of, but it still has lots of choices for people with all different tastes. Also i don't think the prices were that crazy. It was between the rib cook off and here. We spent about $50 less here than we would have there and had a fun night to boot. The chicken trio was great, and my normally not-impressed-by-fancy-restaurants boyfriend loved it. Also the potstickers and sauce were da bomb. All 4 of us liked out dishes and it was lots of food.   The just ok: The service. A little slow, but friendly. The salmon duo. I think it's dangerous to do duo's because one is always better than the other. In this case the salmon curry was way better than the teriyaki, and unfortunately both were way over cooked. I think the curry salmon should be it's own dish. And I would ask for it medium. The menus. I know, it's a weird thing and didn't affect my rating, but they are this huge bulky, drift wood piece that you can't see over to talk to the person across the table from you. I also don't think they fit with the otherwise very classy ambiance. The other weird thing is they are selling their centerpieces. There is a sticker on them with the price. It seemed tacky."}
{"text":"Love this place , yummy food .. pretty food . Artistic and tasty. I wish though they would have a fee change ups now and then ."}
{"text":"A gem hidden away from mainstream Cleveland. Incredible food and service, even better prices. On top of that, more food than you can eat! Definitely check this place out. There wasn't a single thing that I didn't love."}
{"text":"Randomly went to this restaurant.... And we love it now, the food is great and the calamari appetizer delish!"}
{"text":"I just got back from having lunch at this place (went with family) and we were all pleasantly surprised! We all loved our meals, the prices were really good if you consider the ambiance and feel of the place. I got a salmon dish (for 9$), that came with soup of the day. The portion sizes were perfect and we were all so happy with everything that we all got our own dessert. The dessert was fabulous, their mango ice cream is splendid! They make all their desserts themselves which was a definite additional plus.   Our waiter was cordial and professional. The manager came by to ask us how we liked our food. All in all, the staff was nice and committed! I love the classy interior matched with the good food and prices.  The presentation of all the foods was fabulous too! As you can tell, I will most certainly be going back and taking friends!  Edit (2011) - It is important to note that if you want the best bang for your buck, you must go here for lunch rather than dinner!!! The prices do go up a lot for dinner.  Edit v. 2 (2012)- Since that one fated day in 2009 (when I wrote this review), this place has become one of my mainstays. Whenever anyone visits me, I make sure to take them to my favorite restaurant Wild Mango :). Also, business is really booming (the place is always crowded!) yet the quality is still superb."}
{"text":"Wild Mango is a top level restaurant with unique Asian/American cuisine.  I have been here many times over the last 10 years and the food is always consistently top notch .. as is the service and certainly the ambiance.  The crab cake is excellent as is the glazed salmon.  The thai styled shrimp tiger soup is delicious, spicey and thoroughly filling.  It's as good as I've had anywhere.  The deserts are scrumptious.  Real cheese cake, and towering chocolate cake are my favorites.  Lunch is the best time to eat here in that they offer much of what's available during the evenings at amazingly reasonable prices.  It's hard to believe this classy place exists in a shopping mall.  Well worth a visit!  Or two, or more."}
{"text":"Omg I'm so pleasantly surprised by how nice and elegant the restaurant is and how good the food taste!! saying this I haven't even get to the main course yet! We were very last minute(8 mins before they close) they let us sit and provided the best service, we didn't feel rushed at all. We are very grateful and enjoying the food very much. Totally will come back to try out other dishes! Wild mango rocks!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and it was on a Saturday night so it didn't look that busy. The place is nice, the decor is modernized with a contemporary flare, art paintings were out in the lobby as well as inside. It's a very intimate space because it's dark and a place where you would bring a date to. The bathrooms were very nice as well. Granite counter tops and unique faucets. This place also had a small bar by the bathrooms and had a lounge area too.   For drinks, I had their Passion Drink Martini which tasted strong but well worth it because it went well with my dinner. My friend just ordered their Sapporo beer there.  Compliments from the chef - a small pastry with cream cheese and an Asian sausage. Tasted like pizza and it was one small bite of \"can i have another one\" After a few minutes, fresh bread was passed around my friend got their soft dough with rice wine painted on top and I got the crispy baguette. Both tasted scrumptious.   For an appetizer, we ordered their Pepsi Shrimp because we were just curious with how they would incorporate the Pepsi in it. Kind of disappointed, didn't taste much of the Pepsi batter. It was just fried shrimp in a martini glass with a cucumber and pepper salad with fried white noodles.   For our main course, I ordered their seared tuna with tomato-mango risotto and my friend ordered their Shellfish Bouillabaisse. The tuna was cooked perfectly and drizzled on top was a tangy sauce that I didn't care too much for. In the middle, it has the vegetable medley with colored cauliflower (orange and purple ones which I find interesting) which were edible. The risotto was somehow disappointing. From other places I've ate, risotto rice is short-grain and this version was long because it's Asian rice. Prepared with cream sauce, this risotto was a bit heavy for me.   The Bouillabaisse was however, the best dish and wished i had ordered the same. It had a variety of seafood: clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops along with rice noodles and vegetables. The exact description is on their website. The broth tasted right with the curry coconut milk they had listed and the portion of this dish is very generous. It came out as a boat and literally could probably feed 1-3 people.   I'd come again and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant on several occasions.   They are very consistent.   The food is amazingly delicious,  presentation is colorful and appealing to the eyes,  wait staff is friendly and sufficient and the atmosphere is simple,  eloquent,  cozy and clean.  I love dining at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Well, Where should I start?  um...please read the previous review by Karen W ?!  (because we went there together and she has already said everyhing that I wanna to say about this restaurant haha).  I cannot be more happier about this place.  From the very first moment we entered Wild Mango, the decor and the service, even the design of their menu impress me.  We were like kids in the candy store, kept looking around and checking out other customers food.  The presentation was amazing!!!  so good that I didn't want to eat my food!  I strongly recommended the Pepsi shrimp!  (I didn't taste any Pepsi in it but it was gooooood)  If i need to say one bad thing about this place, it would be the table arrangements.  Tables were very close to each other, and the guy right next to us was laughing at our silly conversations =).  Overall I love this place.  It WOWs me and my friends big time, and guess what, I am going back there for V's day tomorrow!!!!"}
{"text":"Crazy good.  Best restaurant ive ever been to that was attached to a mall."}
{"text":"Solid two star place here. The food was good, but you couldn't help but feel a cloud of condescension when dealing with the staff. My appetizer was good and my dinner was great but I had ordered a Caesar salad that became an issue. The salad came out dry as a bone, but the real problem is that it was made with iceberg lettuce. So I didn't eat more than a bite and the waitress came back and asked if I wanted it boxed up instead of asking if there was a problem. So I explained that I had orders a Caesar and they are made with Romaine lettuce. She said ok we can make one with Romaine if you would like and I agreed. She brought out another salad and told me the first one may have looked like Iceberg but was actually Romaine. Um thanks waitress lady but I eat out enough to know the difference. Maybe you should get out a little more before schooling me."}
{"text":"Decent Asian fusion resto, we ordered crab cake & egg plant appetizers. Pesto Salmon & Chicken trio for main course, they were scrumptious !! Everything was fresh, loved the sauces and the garnishing. Must try this place if you live around."}
{"text":"It's next to impossible to find good Asian offerings on Cleveland's west side.  Wild Mango is the exception.  Wild Mango's chefs gleam with creativity.  A delicious artwork that continues to impress with each course.  Try the Vietnamese salad, or something simple like chicken pot stickers.  Stay for the Honey-Sesame glazed chicken, sweeten up with mango cheesecake...and be wowed by the decor in this dining Mecca that does not belong next to a Sears and across from Red Lobster.  Perfect for dining in, or take away.  Their website is a little too glitzy.  Could be troublesome if trying to view on a mobile device."}
{"text":"Pepsi shrimp was tasty but the duck gave me bubble gut. For that and the price, two stars..."}
{"text":"It was good for the price and quality of food the inside is ok but looks torn i had the duck witch you can't find in the area I did enjoy the food just didn't really like the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Ok, seriously! Everytime I come in here this place is empty and I don't get it! ATTENTION PEOPLE: DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS PLACE! EAT HERE! EVERYDAY! First off, the place is a perfect setting for a date, so if you're trying to impress someone and not break the bank, come here. When you come in, you always get a little nibble compliments of the chef. Today was shrimp with cucumber relish with an orange slice. Nice and refreshing for summer. I am obsessed with this Vietnamese salad bowl that comes with an eggroll. It's a big portion and only $9. Do it! It's so stinkin good and you won't regret it.   Today I decided to be different and got the shrimp curry pasta as my entree, and the Thai basil bliss as a as my cocktail. The curry comes in this HUGE portion. Upon closer inspection, I realize that I got ALOT of noodles and broth and not much else. I did get 5 shrimp though, so I'm happy. I'll throw some chicken in my leftovers tomorrow and be good.  The broth itself is pretty good. Nice spice, and not overpowering. Honestly, I'm used to more of a flavor \"punch in the face\" when dealing with curry dishes. Even when I make something at home, it's unmistakably curry. Love my curry. Lol. Wild Mango doesn't get points of for that, it's just an observation.   The Thai basil bliss: so I can tell you, they are NOT stingy with the alcohol. It's not the best compliment to my dinner, but I'm a tequila girl, so whatever. Tip for the drink: stir it up before you take a sip, otherwise it will taste straight up like cough syrup. I was about to slam on this drink, but after I gave it a good stir, the flavors mixed together and it's very good.   Love the sweet roll with the sesame seeds on it and the butter is awesome. Overall, I'm a happy camper."}
{"text":"If you have never been here, this is an absolute must go for you.  Wild Mango offers creatively presented delicious Asian fusion dishes.  Their lunch and dinner menu include Appetizer, Soups/Salads & Entree. The menu is served on a creative wooden plank - sometimes a bit hard to hold but fun none-the-less.  The items are very thoughtfully conceived with taste and presentation in mind.  Each dish is presented in their own unique style.  Upon serving you will most certainly be impressed with the presentation.  They also have a full service bar.  Prices are $9 - $15 lunch menu and $11 - $25 for dinner.    Now, for those who have been here many times, your's truly,  I find it hard to believe that such an innovative & popular eatery have not made even the slightest change in their serving for the last year and a half.  The prices remain the same - high & mixed drinks remain much to the overpowering strong side.    The wait staff are so-so, there is a specific older Asian gentleman who just is not patron friendly, in fact he is borderline rude.  I think he must be related to the owner somehow thus his longevity over the years at this establishment.  I met the owner some years back shortly after they moved to their current location - a very creative, smart individual.  I'm sure he can guide this restaurant to do better."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything from my cocktail to the bread, apps, and entree was amazing. I had the Thai basil drink (strong and refreshing, worth the $10), we shared an appetizer sampler (loved the calamari), and sea scallops for my entree that came with a crab risotto. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I can't stop myself from dropping by this incredible restaurant because I enjoy myself immensely anytime I happen to be out at the mall. I'm an Eastside but it's worth adding on the miles, rain sleet nor snow has ever stopped me from visiting several times a year. The decor catches me off guard everytime. The drapery encasing the booths makes for a very elegant and lavish environment. There's an old world feel to this place but still it's not stuff or overdone. Guest feel welcomed and are invited to stay for more, something I do often. It's nice to feel as if Ive left Ohio which seems to have converted into a lackluster beer and burger capital of the Midwest. (I Digress) the food was a refreshing surprise, the presentation and delivery of it was perfectly timed allowing me and my friends to have a lovely experience. I recommend a visit or two, heck, maybe ten just remember to try the shrimp it's phenomenal!!!"}
{"text":"I had an exceptional dinner at Wild Mango Restaurant this evening.  Started off my meal with a Darby Rose (martini).  I need to follow up with the restaurant to get the exact recipe; however, it had unusual ingredients in it like Jim Beam, Prosecco and strawberry juice.  Bottom line:  The flavor was incredible and it was not sugary sweet like many mixed martini style beverages I avoid.  I then had their Asian Bouillabaisse.  Wow!  Huge portions of fish (scallops, crab, shrimp, clams, mussels) mixed with vermicelli, peppers in a creamy curry broth.  It took me two hours to finish it.  I refused to leave it behind.  It was clearly a 5 star entree.  Then I enjoyed their lovely creme brulee in a magnificent presentation with spun sugar/chopped fruit on top.  Perfect.  Service was great.  Our waitress Leanna was tops.  She was that cross between midwest nice and professional.  The lighting could use a drop of help and the layout a tad unusual.  However, overall we had a tremendous experience and I plan to return shortly.  Prices were also very fair for this calibre and quantity of food.  Also appreciated the fact that the owner came by checking on each dinner guest.  It is a detail like this that differentiates 4 star from 5 star.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. It feels so upscale and pretty yet it's quite casual and super comfortable. The service is good, the food is wonderful, and the presentation is unmatched and spectacular. My ONLY complaint (and it's minor) is the hostess group of young ladies are notoriously snotty and obnoxious. However, last week the hostess was sweet and pleasant AND there was a hostess wanted sign on the door.  Looks like this place might creep into 5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this place! Love it, the food is always fresh and so beautifully displayed on the plate. We are always seated quickly and the servers are always quick and attentive. I usually get the Yellow Curry with chicken, but decided the change it up and get the salmon dish last time we were there. Amazing! The salmon was wrapped and steamed in a cabbage leaf and was flakey. It also came with a side of yellow curry veggies so I didn't miss out on my favorite. I love the sweet and spiciness of Thai food and this place does it right!"}
{"text":"The tuna tartare was exquisite... A truly unforgettable dish. I enjoyed the serene atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The quality and flavors of the food were so impressive for the price. Booked a reservation for a graduation dinner on the way out of our first visit!"}
{"text":"By far, my favorite restaurant in North Olmsted. This place is all about ambiance. Each seat in the right dining area is a tall booth lined in fabric, which makes for a very intimate experience.   The menu here is unbeatable. The last few times we've gone I've gotten the chicken cheesecake which is amazing! Also, they have the best creme brûlée in the Cleveland area! I I love you this place!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have never such a bad dining experience. Given they were busy, we waited way too long, and our waitress was  1 just really bad at her job or 2 sadly...opioids   I would love to say she was just not capable, but you could tell there is something else going on...not to mention they were completely understaffed.  Arrived 710 Greeted by our waitress 730 First Drinks come 740 Takes our order 745, Appetizers arrive 815 Dinner arrives 910 which was cold and bland  I had such high hopes for the place... but sadly no! With so many amazing places in the great northern area, I suggest going somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is too good to be true .. A 5 star in every aspect. Cleanliness, atmosphere, service and food! Outstanding!! If you are ever in the greater Cleveland are, this is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Really excited to write my first 5 star review!! Wild mango is that good.   The shrimp romano is a must try. The dish hovers in the median of the price range, which is from 15-25. Crispy and very tastely. YUM.  Ill update this soon as i need to check this place out again!"}
{"text":"My wife & I went to Wild Mango for lunch on a Sunday. The food was refined and excellent. (One of these adjective does not follow from the other!) The complimentary scallop cream soup was very good in particular (although it did not contain whole scallops or even large pieces, so we joked they were getting two uses from the same scallops! - but as long as the result is good, who cares.) The prices were surprisingly low for the quality - around $10 per main course.  Waiting for them to open in Beachwood Mall, according to the rumors, to go again."}
{"text":"Can a place be tri-polar?   First it's in a mall, which shouldn't necessarily count against this place, but gives you a certain expectation as you walk up.  Then you walk in and it's super-fancy. Like, Vegas, Japanese-spa fancy. It's not that it's tacky--more like, you walk in and think, \"Oh crap, what did I get myself into? This is going to be expensive!\" And if you're just there for lunch, like I was, you don't want it to be that fancy. But I could see how this would be fun for a date or dinner at night.   Then you see the menu--it also looks so fancy, but the lunch prices are actually more than reasonable. Or at least you think so... then you get the tiny portions and just \"OK\" food and you wonder why you thought $11 was a decent deal. And the food isn't bad. It's just... trying to be so much more than it is. I got the lunch-sized portion of the NY-strip steak, sauteed mushrooms and sweet potato fries. First--while the presentation was pretty, those couldn't have been actual sweet potatoes. They tasted too much like squash, either way, they were pretty bland. The steak was tender and the sauce was flavorful, but 4-5 thin, tiny slices of meat is hardly worth $11.   The service was pleasant--no complaints there. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. The shrimp curry noodle soup was my other choice and something tells me I would have liked that better. It was less money and a larger portion.  Anyways--it's good, but just don't expect the fancy decor and the presentation of the food to match the taste."}
{"text":"What a perfect lunch!  With a touch of elegance, delicious specials, and lunch prices that I hardly could blink at...I'd say that this Asian Fusion hotspot is more than worth checking out!!!   Having always wanted to eat at a more gourmet restaurant. This place fit the bill! Literally.    We started off with fried wontons..a perfect blend of boiled and crisped with a savory chicken and vegetable filling and topped with a sweet and spicy chile sauce.  Our entrees came with a scallop pea soup that can only be described as divine. A beautiful slab of salmon crusted with pesto atop a bed of rice and pooling next to it, a coconut curry sauce; was the entree. Every bite was bursting with flavor and the plating was so well achieved, that the meal made it to my camera phone.  Finishing off was a vanilla creme brûlée that was topped with spun sugar and a berry-mango compote that went so elegantly with a robust coffee.   Let's not forget about drinks!!! The Jasmine martini was a delicious pre-dinner cocktail and I recommend it to any gin lover!   All in all, this was an edible experience that I will be reliving very soon...maybe for dinner?"}
{"text":"Excellently prepared meals and surprisingly modest price. I had pot stickers, shrimp curry soup and also complementary split pea scallop bisque at lunch. Flavors were wonderful and expertly prepared, veggies, shrimp, and noodles not over cooked. :) Restaurants interior is pleasing and provides great ambiance for conversations. The place is popular and intimate... you may have to wait for a table. Service was quick for us, highly recommended dining."}
{"text":"I have been to Wild Mango a few times. Yesterday my son invited me for lunch. What a great experience! Had their risotto with bits of pineapple and tomato sauce with mushrooms and scallops! They gave us complementary corn soup with chicken. We ordered pot stickers that were delicious. My son ordered ribs. Every thing was excellent, especially the price! Service was great!  I'll be going back soon! Keep up the good job"}
{"text":"It was my daughter's birthday and we decided after hearing about Wild Mango to give it a try based mostly on reviews on Yelp.  We were all (3 adults) disappointed.  The ambiance is very, very nice and the dishes the food comes on are unique but that's about all I really liked.  My daughter and I both ordered the sea scallops.  There were only 3 scallops on the plate with some kind of sauce which wasn't even warm.  In fact, the food was not even at room temperature.  My husband ordered the chicken with broccoli and white rice.  He said that the chicken was hot enough but the rice and broccoli were on the cool side.  Kind of expensive for what you get.  We probably will not be back."}
{"text":"I went with my mother to this place. It's a fancy, chic place in the mall. Food was good and service was solid. Had the chicken trio, which was small, but quite tasty. Nice place"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been coming here for years and I never get tired of it. I usually order the chicken cheesecake and sesame chicken with the chicken pot stickers"}
{"text":"As Anton Ego said in the movie Ratatouille, \"Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere.\"  In the case of Wild Mango, this artist comes from the humbling confines of Great Northern Mall (hidden behind a Red Lobster, no less).  The most striking thing about Wild Mango is the design of the space the restaurant occupies.  It starts in the white ante room and a hostess who is happy to take your coat for you.  Off the ante room is a bar area complete with couches and curtains--something that would not be out of place as a small Las Vegas VIP area.  Towards the main dining room, there is a fairly impressive display of the available wines.  The main dining room itself is just the right size for an intimate dinner--it actually reminded me of the main dining area at Charlie Trotter's in Chicago but without the middle server/preparation area.  While I thought the lacquer tables were a bit out of place, the room is nicely furnished.  Even more interesting were the little enclave dining rooms off the main room that can provide an even more personal environment.  I thought that the food, by taste, was...just okay and maybe a little disappointing after taking in the interior design of the restaurant.  The Pepsi Shrimp is pretty basic, and the Bouillabaisse (which I got upon the server's recommendation) was about the same.  I will give Wild Mango a lot of credit, though, for outstanding design in plating and presenting food.  One aspect of plating that is sometimes neglected by even very top restaurants is to offer a variety of presentation in terms of the how high the food stands off the plate.  It is clear that a lot of thought and care goes into the the overall presentation--both in the food and in the structure--at Wild Mango.  Overall, Wild Mango is a bit pricier than some of its competitor restaurants in the North Olmsted area.  I think, however, it is money well spent to have at least the start of a fine dining experience in a wholly unexpected locale.  If Wild Mango could ratchet up its food offerings--both in taste and creativity--it would be on its way to competing with the best restaurants in Northeast Ohio."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here. Went out with my family for my birthday. We saw the waitress a total of 2 times. It took 20 minutes to get hot sauce that my dad asked for. By the time he got the hot sauce and the last refill for his drink he had finished his meal. Our receipt was wrong, and it took another 15 minutes to get someone to check on it. The waitress never came back, but the manager approached the table. He had theee WORST communication skills. All he said was \"What happened?\" And snatched the receipt away. Altogether terrible customer service. This is the 3rd time this has happened at this establishment. I all not be returning or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here on a weekend to pick up some lunch. The restaurant is attached to a mall which makes you think it might have more of a laid back vibe to it, but no, walk through the doors and everybody be wearing suits and dresses. FANCY. I actually put some effort into my attire that day but still felt a bit out of place. Oh well, placed our order then hit the mall while we waited. At home we opened up the goods and this is what we got...  -Chicken Pot Stickers: Been there, done that. The thinly sliced cucumber on top was a nice touch though.  -Shrimp Curry Noodle Soup: Tasted okay even after being in the fridge a few days. Glad to find 6 medium sized shrimp in it.  -Chicken Cheesecake: Stay away from this. Dry and had a lifeless flavor to it. The side of thick cut sweet potato fries were good though, I think they were tempura fried.  -Sauteed Sea Scallops: Very good! Only had 3 scallops but the meal was just so creamy and tasty it didn't even matter. A little black pepper and my mouth was pretty happy eating that.  -Creme Brulee: A delicious end to our tasting that day. Crispy sugary crust with a smooth custard and chopped up fruit that really paired well with it.   The lunch prices are reasonable, and although I only really liked two things, I would check this place out again, I'll just have to remember to wear my ballgown next time."}
{"text":"I used to love the Wild Mango and have been going to it for three years now. This past weekend I went there again for lunch and was very very disappointed. I heard that there has been a new chef who certainly didn't do as good of a job as the chef before. The menu is exactly the same as it always has been but it did not taste the same.  I had a mango ice tea, chicken cream soup, Japanese eggplant, Strawberry spinach salad and the Sea scallops. The ice tea was more blend than I remembered it.   The soup was fine.  The eggplant appetizer was very unappetizing. It had very thinly sliced tomatoes and eggplants (about 8 slices total) on the plate and \"topped\" with giant slab of mozzarella. I felt like I was eating a baked mozzarella mess with slimy juicy \"something\" on the bottom. Yuck.  The strawberry salad was alright, but not as carefully made as it used to. The dressing was a bit much than usual. (If I want extra dressing, I will ask for it!)  The sea scallop entree tasted just like it was before except that the chef over cooked the scallops! How could you mess up something like that at a restaurant this nice! It tasted like rubber. What a waste of a bunch of good tasty scallops.    Of course, being a good child. I finished all the food I could and brought home the left overs. I don't believe that food has to go to waste just because the chef can't cook.   Please Jia Wei, come back to be the chef!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite, quiet places to go and have a delicious bite to eat. Love the teriyaki and chicken pot stickers"}
{"text":"The place was empty they sat us in a booth and forgot us.  The waiter showed up to take out order and get the check.  This is the second time the service was horrible. The food was awesome as always but not sure it's worth the crappy service"}
{"text":"I'm typically not a fan of Asian Fusion, because when I want Asian food, I want it done right and don't expect it to break the bank, but Wild Mango delivered enough for me to be a fan.  The decor is sleek and modern with an intimate atmosphere. The rest rooms were even classier.  All you need now is caucasian servers and well presented but overpriced Chinese food... check and check!  All jokes aside, the servers were friendly and attentive, and the food was in fact presented well and tasted great too.  We started off with the calamari appetizer which arrived in a nice little fried wonton basket with a delectable sweet chili sauce. It was good, but not Sushi Rock good.  For the main course, I played it safe and went with the Honey Sesame Glazed Chicken, which also arrived in a fried wonton basket, with broccoli and two triangle shaped packs of rice coated in sesame seeds. I loved it. Sesame chicken is a very \"tired\" dish, but Wild Mango definitely separated themselves from the average takeout joints. The crispy/juicy chicken, the sweet sesame sauce... excellent. The sauce ended up being a bit too heavy towards the end, and as much as I wanted to leave no trail of that wonton basket behind, I couldn't finish it. Also, the rice was a bit dry.  Others in my party ordered:  - Bouillabaise - wow, this could feed a family. I didn't get a chance to taste it but by all accounts it was good. - White Truffle Chicken - this was OK. The sauce was a bit too garlicky. - Seared Tuna and Sea Scallop - good, but would not fill me up at all. - Chicken Trio - did not get a chance to try but the one who ordered it was not wowed.  I would probably go again, but only if it was a special occasion. You're paying for the decor and the presentation of the food first, and the food itself second."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian-American restaurant of all times. If you don't like Asian food like me, you would still try it because it's not too Asian. As you may know, I am not a big eater, so I usually order the fried calamari or the potstickers and they are so good! Every time I go there for lunch, I get the soup of the day which is a lot of times corn and chicken soup. At dinner they give you a little cup of soup and the last time I went there for dinner I got a broccoli soup, which was even better than the corn and chicken soup! I can't forget to talk about dessert because they only have a few choices, but it is so amazing! The portions are a little big and a little sweet, but it's totally worth it to try it. If you are looking for a formal, not busy dinner place, this is the best place to go to. I can't wait until they are done with a Wild Mango's second location in Legacy Village!"}
{"text":"I was looking up a local restaurant to dine in with my parents to celebrate my first full time job and new year 2014. After reading great reviews of Wild Mango on both Yelp and Trip Advisor. We decided to give it a try. And Wild Mango definitely meets if not exceeds our expectations!   I reserved seats for lunch a week ahead. And we found out it's necessary to reserve a seat as it gets quite busy around lunch time. We were asked to wait for a couple minutes as we arrived earlier than the reserved time. We were quickly seated at a nice spot at the common area which is cozy and well illuminated. The décor is beautiful and my mom loves it since she stepped into the restaurant!  We ordered appetizer sampler which is not on the menu, it is $26, which we think is reasonably priced (check the pictures I uploaded), we each ordered surf and turf, curry noodle soup and scallop dish. WOW, the portion is good and delicious. My parents absoulutely loved the curry noodle soup and scallop dish that they highly recommend everyone to try! Finally, as I saw so many dessert pictures on yelp but they didn't have a dessert menu, I just showed the waiter the picture of the dessert we wanted. And they got presented with no surprise! Amazing art pieces!  The waiter we had was AMAZING as well. He was very attentive and patient.  My mom said she would definitely come back again for any occasions especially for the quality and price!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was pleasantly surprised! Party of 4 shared the appetizer sampler...it was good but not worth $26. However, the reasonbky priced dinners both looked and tasted amazing! I had the sauteed sea scallops. Also ordered was the surf & turf, romano shrimp and shrimp curry soup. All meals were excellent. The only downside to the evening was our server wasnt too friendly. But he may have just been tired!  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Super good! It's a sister restaurant to Weia Teia in Oberlin, OH and a number of the dishes are the same, but both are great! I would say $$$ though: entrees are $18-28."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots.  I've only been here for dinner once and it was a couple years ago so I don't really remember the logistics of it.  However, I don't remember it being terrible so it must have been good.   However, for lunch, it's one of the best deals around.  Every entree comes with complimentary soup.  The tuna tartar is delicious, comes with a citrus vinaigrette and the dumplings are  homemade with a crispy outside.   Their sweet potato fries are thick cut with a tempura coating.  The chicken cheesecake has a thick crab cake like consistency.  Just delicious.  Everything on the menu is delicious.  The service is impeccable and the decor is mesmerizing Every time I walk inside I'm amazed at how nice the place is."}
{"text":"I am always blown away every time I come here. The food is amazing (and beautiful!), and the atmosphere is fantastic. I love this place and I wish it was closer to my home. Thank you for huge delicious portions at a cheap price!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the most romantic and private resturant..its very elegant and perfect for a date. They have an entire book of wine selections and from California, Italy, Chile, Greece, France and more. They prices have a wide range as well. The food was perfectly seasoned and creatively placed. Food was fresh and the bread rolls were still warm. I'm beyond pleased with the outstanding service!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch before some retail therapy. I had been to Wild Mango years ago for dinner and remember the food being decent but pricey.  The lunch menu was actually very decently priced and the entrees all came with a complimentary soup.  For being in a mall, this place is really nice. The decor is classy and kind of romantic. The service was great and our waitress was very attentive and personable. I got the Romano Shrimp.  My friends ordered the Sauteed Sea Scallops and the Shrimp Curry Noodle Soup.  My shrimp were perfectly battered and tasty.  The sweet potato fries were thick and large, but perfectly cooked on the inside and crispy on the outside.  The portions aren't super large here but with the soup I left full. I tried my friends' dishes too.  The scallops were really well seasoned.  I thought the curry noodle soup had a great curry flavor and honestly was the best deal of all the entrees we got.  It was a pretty big bowl."}
{"text":"In the Great Northern sea of commercialism in the oyster bed of corporate chains, one can find a lone pearl camouflaged amid the aggregate of ordinary - a rarity known as Wild Mango.  High concept Asian fusion cuisine paired with a modern, yet elegant atmosphere were the last things I expected to find here.  Simple and tasteful, the decor was reminiscent of a posh, upscale establishment you would see in a part of town experiencing an urban renewal renaissance.  Even the bathroom sink looked like a place where affluent people from the future wash their hands!      The food was simply exquisite.  Each dish was well thought-out, with a lot of attention paid to plating and presentation.  The calimari appetizer was amazing -  small, tender rings with a light batter and a subtle seafood flavor like shrimp chips at a Chinese restaurant.  The sauteed scallops were paired with a delicious risotto and a creamy oyster mushroom sauce, and the seafood tasted very fresh.  The chicken trio was an experience in and of itself - three unique entrees with their own sauces and garnishes, each working well individually and with each other. The lava cake we had for dessert had a basket of berries with it - the basket itself is made from crystalized sugar, and was entirely edible!   At Wild Mango, they have seriously thought of everything.  At one point, I was eating the chicken drumstick an mashed potatoes from my chicken trio entree, and I thought to myself \"Would it be rude to ask for hot sauce at a nice restaurant like this?\"  Low and behold, the dots of red sauce strategically placed around the mashed potatoes were an Asian chili sauce!  Possibly the best part about this restaurant is the value.  Aside from a few of the entrees, everything is reasonably priced, and you could easily enjoy a one of a kind dinner here for less than $50.  If this restaurant were located anywhere other than the mall, they could charge $5-10 more per dish, and you wouldn't think anything of it.  Wild Mango truly is one of Cleveland's hidden gems."}
{"text":"First off, the ambiance here is outstanding.  I went with a party of 24(!!) after a funeral - not a fair test for your first experience at a restaurant, yet the lthe food was high-quality, and the service was excellent (all things considered).  It was here that I discovered the wonderful thing that is Pea and Scallop soup.  Wow!  This was served as part of our courses and, while it doesn't look like much more than the thin green water left over after a child paints something in watercolors , it is one of the best things I've ever tasted!  I will say that a bit of French bread and spiced butter would've helped this tremendously, but again, party of 24.  I had something new (to me) called Chicken Cheesecake, recommended by my sister, a regular, and it was flavorful, well-balanced, not too cheesy and chock full of chicken.  It unfolds in your belly much like a cheesecake does too, so if you come hungry, this will definitely cure that... ha!  All in all, this is the place to be for a good, sophisticated meal with great ambiance, whether for an intimate 1:1 or with a well-behaved group."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Much more intimate and quieter than main dining room.  No Wi-Fi. As a business traveler, this was unfortunate but understandable.  Everything tasted great.  Not sure about the sweet potato fries with the surf & turf, though."}
{"text":"A bit pricier than I expected, but very nice atmosphere. Food was good and service was great, up until the end. Asked for box for leftovers; they took it back to the kitchen to box up. Then, had to ask twice for the check, paid, then continue waiting another 10 minutes for our boxed leftovers to return. Nothing fancy, just a styrofoam box. No clue why it took 20 minutes...."}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  The atmosphere is truly wonderful.  However, the wait staff could use lessons on how to treat and great customers.  They have a tendency to disappear.  If you want drink refills or water refills, you pretty much have to go looking for them.  And while, this isn't their fault, the parking is awful.   Every single time we have come, we have ended up parking down by Sears."}
{"text":"The food was great and we both enjoyed our appetizer and our mains. For the record we had the chicken potstickers, the tuna with scallop and the Thai style scallops.  The service was a bit more hit and miss. It took a long time to get seated, but was pretty good after that.  The decor needs some updating. Sort of an odd mix - almost like Italian Asian Fusion. But that was no big deal. The seating was lumpy and buttons had come off the quilting. Time for an update folks.  Prices were reasonable for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is Asian fusion with more American flavors with a splash of Asian. It is truly a nice treat. The presentation is a five. The ribs are amazing and the sweet potato fries are tasty and come out looking nice. Lunch comes with free soup. Many interesting items in the menu that are great! I have eaten here at least five times and never had a bad experience Don't forget the dessert, the presentation is amazing with sugar art."}
{"text":"Been there once with a friend. The food is beautiful and tastes great. The service is super. It is a good place to meet for business purpose or with friends."}
{"text":"It really pains me to write a bad review about Wild Mango. I started eating here back when it was Weia Tea and located on the other side of Great Northern. Back then the food was phenomenal, the service was exceptionally friendly. I was impressed when they opened in their swanky new digs a few doors down and hoped that it meant great things for Wild Mango.  Since the move I visited infrequently, and the food was as good as I remembered. Last night, however, was a different story. Before then it had been at least a year, maybe longer, since I had visited Wild Mango. I surprised to see signs of neglect amongst the swanky decor: the stained, torn velvet seat cushion on our booth; the dollar store glass vase holding a lifeless red rose; minor details that sent my spidey-senses tingling.  We started with an appetizer of the chicken pot-stickers. They had a nice crunchy sear, the sign of a well made pot-sticker, and while the ginger-soy vinaigrette was good, it was drizzled on very thinly. My first half had sauce, and it was delicious. My second bite was plain and I was surprised to notice how bland the chicken mixture tasted. For our amuse-bouche we were given chicken cigars; the same mixture in a fried spring roll wrapper with a sriracha-mayo drizzle. The mayo stole the show, in an almost overpowering sort of way.  We were given breads: a french baguette and a brioche roll. The baguette was old, the crust near impossible to tear apart. The brioche was lovely and light, with the wonderful doughiness indicative of egg breads. Then came our entrees. I had ordered the Five-Spiced Roast Duck- it was gorgeous. Wild Mango really does excel at presentation. Their wide variety of serving dishes makes me feel like I am on Iron Chef. This particular entree was served on a long narrow plate with Japanese eggplant salad and sweet potato chestnut mash. Unlike the other reviewers, my duck skin was not crispy. It was chewy, and made eating it (and the fatty layer under it) rather unappealing. Actually, the duck itself was rather chewy, or chewier than it should have been. I do believe it was overcooked; there wasn't any pink and the texture reminded me of overcooked pork. The cold Japanese eggplant (pickled) salad was nice, and I didn't really care for the sweet potatoes. I love sweet potatoes and I love chestnuts, but the meaty, mealy taste and texture did not pair well with the fluffy whipped potatoes. Neither really seemed to fit well with the duck, though. I was wholly unsatisfied after my meal, and to me, that is the worst feeling. Even my dining companion's steak, which is usually melt in your mouth wonderful, was given a shoulder shrug and a passive \"It was okay\".   Thank goodness the creme brulee was delicious. Although, if anyone from Wild Mango is reading this, please tone down the use of the sugar strands. After a while the strands become too sweet, break off and stick to the table, your hands, and get in the way of your delicious caramelized brulee. In a world where presentation gets five points, sometimes simplicity is the most elegant presentation of all.   Then again, you don't have to take my suggestion. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Whenever there is a special occasion/birthday me and my boyfriend's family go to Wild Mango.  What I love most about Wild Mango is the presentation in it's décor, ambience, bathroom, and food! It is absolutely beautiful.  The presentation of the food makes you feel like you are eating something special.   There is a variety of dishes that any type of diner will find pleasing. I was dining with a couple of extremely picky eaters (people who only eat hamburgers and pizza...Shameful..I know) and they were  able to find something they enjoyed.  Even though it was extremely hot outside and the air conditioning wasn't working in the private booth we were sitting in, I ordered the Shrimp Curry Noodle Soup. PHENOMENAL!  Everyone at the table was saying \"oooh!\" and \"aaah!\" because of the massive size. I especially loved that it was only $14!  Also,  I am the queen of ordering something big enough so that I can have leftovers the next day.....Let's just say I had enough leftovers for two servings...one to eat later on when I got home and one for my lunch the next day =) If you enjoy getting complimentary food, Wild Mango will not disappoint, they offer you bread (brioche or baguette) and a tiny dish of shrimp with mandarin and pesto.  Both were delicious. If you ever have something to celebrate and you don't want to go to some chain restaurant check out Wild Mango"}
{"text":"Wild Mango is not adventurous or pretentious,just good food at good prices served by nice people. I've eaten here at least 60 times and never had a bad meal or experience.The lunch menu may just be the best bang for the buck in C-town.Hell, you get a free bowl of soup(Rodney Dangerfield would be so impressed!)"}
{"text":"Really like this place! Went for lunch once. Their lunch menu had a lot of options and was very reasonable. The service was good and the food was very tasty. I got the sesame chicken. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This used to be my absolute favorite restaurant in the Cleveland area, but I suppose my expectations have gotten higher in the last couple of years.  They used to serve crescent type rolls with scallions baked in, but now you get a sweet brioche or a French roll, neither of which can hold a light to the original.    I used to love the seared tuna in tomato ginger broth and shrimp risotto and order it just about every time I came, but now it's just a reminder that the menu hasn't really changed in years.  I ordered the romano shrimp this last time, but I thought the dish could really have used more of a dipping sauce for the shrimp and sweet potato fries than just the little bit of sriracha mayo used to decorate the plate.    I used to be really impressed with the presentation of the dishes, but it's no longer that innovative.  I think it's time that Wild Mango have a makeover and remind me why I loved it so much in the first place."}
{"text":"Both my girlfriend and I have concluded that Wild Mango is poorly executed, expensive Italian-Asian fusion.  Maybe our expectations were too high?  The decor reminded me of Melting Pot.  I did enjoy the privacy and the ambiance.  However, the chairs were uncomfortably hard and too large for my 5'1\" girlfriend.  She could not sit with her back to the chair without lifting her feet up off the ground.  And the menus are printed on really bulky and obtrusive wooden surfboards.  The food: - They gave us two pieces of bread - the croissant-like bun was stale and hard; the other was burnt but tasted sort of like Asian bao bread, so it was okay. - The calamari was sliced way too thin, and I could only taste the breading.  It was seasoned with their version of Chinese five spice, which had a flavor profile that is best described as off-putting. - The chicken trio: The chicken cheesecake looked and tasted like a cheeseburger (it was okay). The middle chicken slices were overcooked and dry.  The chicken drumstick was good but the mashed potatoes that it was embedded in were not. - The duck was also seasoned with the five spice, but I managed to bear some of it because they also added a bit of sugar.  It came with sweet potato mash that wasn't sweet and tasted kind of disgusting.  Our waitress seemed hesitant and sort of uncomfortable talking to us.  Maybe she wasn't used to having actual Asian people eat here.  We didn't finish our meal, went home and had microwave TV dinners."}
{"text":"I was dragged back to Wild Mango and, wow, it got worse. I tried the pesto-crusted salmon with coconut curry and vegetables. Clearly this restaurant sees vegetables as a garnish--the medley of potatoes and greens were diced so small I thought a spoon might be better to eat it with. The salmon was nice, but it--like the duck I tried previously--was stacked on a mound of inedible, starchy microwaveable Uncle Ben's sticky rice. The curry sauce, in an attempt to be artistic, was smeared on one end of the ridiculously long plate, though that was actually tasty. The mango cheesecake was passable, though I doubt it had ever seen an actual mango in the kitchen.   Two of the plates I received had large chips in them. The coffee mugs are ridiculously elaborate and made it difficult to drink from. The velour-ish chairs, again, were unwieldy and pressed you right up against your neighbor. It's just an unpleasant experience in the middle of suburbia."}
{"text":"FIVE PLUS stars for presentation!  Check out yelper photos. The photos got me in but the calamari was very tasty.  Loved the Vietnamese salad and noodle bowl and pesto salmon.  Beautiful. Very reasonably priced as well. New fave spot when we come to cleveland."}
{"text":"Such great lunch menu prices! Food was all amazing to taste. And they even had a dessert that they brought out with a candle for birthday celebration!  Would recommend to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"I had a stop while on business in Cleveland, and the business partners there suggested we go to this place...I am open to new things...so sure?!?  First off, its located at the local mall, so I was instantly skeptical...but...the decor is very \"Quaint Asian Spa Getaway\" with wall fountians, orchids, high privacy wall, curtains, etc.    The hostess and server were very nice and very attentive.  The menus are these massive wood plank things which were very weird...but hey...you won't lose them!  The apps were eclectic, and very good...had the Tuna Tartare and it was flavorful and well prepped.    I got a mango-soy glazed pan seared salmon...it was good...well cooked if not a little overcooked...but it was good.  I was not a fan of the sweet potato wedges that came with it...but whatever...  All in all was a comfortable business lunch.  ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Favorite Cleveland restaurant!!! Chicken truffle is heaven on a plate. I've tried just about everything, and everything has always been superb!!! Thanks Wild Mango!!!"}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal. The duck dish here was out of this world and I am still thinking about it. It was perfectly crispy on the outside and pink and tender inside. The presentation is lovely. The prices are actually not too bad for what you're getting. The portions are huge. I wish there were a Wild Mango in Chicago.   P.S. Make sure you check out the futuristic bathrooms!"}
{"text":"I went a couple years ago and had the tiger shrimp which were good, but the portion was small. I really enjoyed the atmosphere though. I also remember thinking the prices were a little high for the area (attached to Great Northern Mall). Recently my mom visited and described their elaborate desserts which she reported tasted amazing. So I'm going to bookmark this one to go back and give it another try."}
{"text":"I met a friend at Wild Mango for lunch while I was in Cleveland over the holidays.  We had met there a couple of years back, so we decided to keep up the tradition.  The ambiance is a little odd to me, like I can't figure out what they're trying to go for.  We were seated at a table a little further back in the restaurant.  The whole meal I felt as if someone was eavesdropping on us through the thick velvet curtains that surrounded our booth.  I was feeling a bit under the weather and was craving soup, so I went with the shrimp curry noodle soup.  It was super, super filling and really hit the spot.  It was served pipping hot, which made it a little hard to eat, and I think it would have used a little more salt.  I enjoyed my meal and will be back."}
{"text":"You will enjoy the food but be aware of the tip added to your check. My card came back minus the original check indicating the tip was included."}
{"text":"Exquisitely crafted meals with fine detail to presentation.  A lot of creativity is put into the menu, and it shows.  The dishes, when brought out, look so nice you almost feel bad eating it (Well, almost).   In almost every dish, there is a blending of East meets West which makes each meal unique.  For example, our amuse-bouche was an avant-garde interpretation of pepperoni pizza.  In a shot glass, you have a basil-tomato type puree with basil foam on top, and a singular slice of Chinese sausage (or Chinese pepperoni, as they call it).  For the \"crust,\" a thin cracker stick is laid on top of the glass.  I was apprehensive because I've never really tried to imbibe my pizza before, but it actually had a quite pleasing taste that did remind me of a pepperoni pizza.    The Pepsi shrimp appetizers were delicious, and I tried some of the sesame chicken and had the chicken trio.  The sesame chicken, as stated by my husband, is the best sesame chicken he's every had.  Tender chicken, crisp batter, and a delicious sauce.  I appreciated the idea of the chicken trio, and it was beautifully presented, but for me I probably won't be ordering this again.  Compared to the other two types of chicken in this dish- a 5-spice marinated drumstick and pesto-topped chicken breast, the stuffing and chicken in the \"chicken cheesecake\" seemed mismatched due to its heavy taste.  Dessert was superb.  The 14-layer chocolate cake was very light and not overly sweet.  In general, this is a great place to have a nice dinner. The entrees are very reasonably priced for the quality of food that you get, and the atmosphere makes you forget that you are actually in a restaurant that is part of a mall.  In addition, service is very good, and the owner takes time to make sure everything is running smoothly.  We were part of a large party of 8 on a Saturday night and the owner personally stopped by to make sure everything was alright.  I will definitely be going here again."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch before driving back home in the country.  Food is really good.  We were regularly checked on for drinks.  Definitely would stop back here if I was in the area. It was better than most places I'd stop."}
{"text":"For those who rate this place lower than 4 star are really not fair.  My family lives in DC area where we have fairly decent Asian eating places, this one is superior than all of them in overall experiences and food quality.  My wife and I came at the recommendation of our son and daughter-in-law.  I don't know if the dinner is any different from the lunch we had (price is much higher as I was told).  It is really a place you must give it a try."}
{"text":"After my first visit to Wild Mango I knew I had to return when I was in this area again. I always hate to lower a rating, because my sesame chicken was fantastic...however, the soup was not. I love that wild mango gives you soup while you wait for your meal, I don't love that there wasn't a choice in soup. We went on a Sunday for lunch, which is a popular dining day. The soup given to us was split pea and scallop. Myself, and 2 others dining at the table did not like it at all. This just isn't a very popular/friendly flavor, especially for those that don't care for seafood.  Other than that, the main course continues to be delicious and the service is great."}
{"text":"Maybe I should start by saying that I was visiting the area on business and I saw that this was a 5-star establishment on Yelp and thought I should check it out.  It was awful. I had the Pepsi-Cola friend shrimp to start, which might have had a slightly soda-ish flavor, but the dollop of Sriracha on top blew my taste buds out, so I can't say for sure. Doesn't really matter anyway, as the shrimp was overcooked to the point that it was chewy and they left the contents of the intestine in (that line along the back of the shrimp is not, as some people seem to think, part of the nervous system). Ugly.  For the main course, I had the BBQ ribs, which were probably 70% fat and gristle by mass. The rice was slightly undercooked, and I didn't even touch the veggies, so I can't say much about that. But again, ugly.  Now, I will say that my coworker had the chicken potstickers (gyoza), and they were pretty good. That's why this place gets one star. That and the fact that I can't rate it any lower. The ambiance was nice, and waitstaff was attentive, but none of that matters if the food is awful. And unfortunately, it was awful."}
{"text":"I have been at Wild Mango on at least a dozen occasions, and have been very satisfied nearly every time.   The decor and atmosphere are fantastic, the private booths in particular are very nice.  The staff has always been very friendly, no complaints at all.  The food is great and very unusual (in a good way) and presented in a fashion unmatched in the Cleveland area.  My favorite dishes here are the Chicken Cheesecake (Lunch) and the Bouillabaisse (Dinner).  Both are very unique and full of flavor.  The only dish I have had here that has been sub par is the Five Spiced Duck,  The Duck seemed a little over cooked and a little bland.  The Desserts are my favorite thing about Wild Mango, the Seven Layer Cake is a 10/10 and the Creme Brulee is a close second.   I would recommend this place to anyone, just be prepared to spend some $$ if going for dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, atmosphere, and prices. Our second time here and still haven't had one bad thing. Definitely on our frequent list of restaurants to go to."}
{"text":"This was fantastic! Everyone loved the food.  Tried the curry noodle soup with shrimp in coconut curry broth. So yummy! And it is spicy and its enough for two.  Kid had the chicken cheesecake, also really good.  Fancier surroundings makes you think it's going to be pricey but it was very affordable for lunch.  Not far from the airport. Good stop for a bite after getting off the plane.  Others in the group had the duck, chicken terriyaki, steak and mushrooms, ginger salmon, and Caesar salad.  Lots of clean plates. Excellent service too."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while....let's just say we were very disappointed. We ordered the sampler appetizer and it was mediocre at best. I had the surf and turf and my boyfriend got the salmon duo. Let's just say that they have to make ether food look fancy to cover up the fact that there is no flavor. The only thing that was right on my dish was the temp of the streak. Other than that there was no seasoning on anything what so ever.I had to ask the server for salt. The salmon on my boyfriends dish was cooked to a pulp. Very dry and flavorless a well. Some one should also tell the chef or who ever is running the kitchen that pesto is very over powering and doesn't need to be used in every dish on the menu. We will definitely not beer going back or recommending this place to anyone...not worth the price what so ever"}
{"text":"I've tried Jia Wei's other establishment and this is probably the most complete restaurant he has. I'm not saying anything is wrong with Weia Teia and Tooo Chinoise in Oberlin, but this has a restaurant feel with people actually dining in it. It is probably one of the best Asian-Fusion outside of Cleveland (with Bac getting the nod for the best in Cleveland itself).  I went here with a group of friends for dinner who also enjoyed their meals. I ordered the Tuna Tar Tar ($15.00) and the Five-Spiced Roast Duck ($20.00). The tar tar is a must and is amazingly presented (along with all of the other dishes). The duck wasn't the best duck I had but it did have a lot of flavor. I know that some people didn't like the duck here so maybe it is one of the hit-or-miss dishes depending on the day but I hope they became consistent with their cooking. I wouldn't try the duck right off the bat if you don't like eating duck and to tell you the truth, I would probably would've tried to Surf and Turf before the duck if I wasn't craving it.  Recommended Dish: Tuna Tar Tar"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurant in Cleveland area.  I have only been around Cleveland for a year and was so happy I found this place.  Food has always been good whenever I visited.   The service was not always the best but the food definitely made up for it.   One of my favorite dish here is Shrimp Curry Noodle Soup.  The presentation has always been great, the portions were generous and it also came with a soup for lunch.    Today, I decided to get that same soup as Takeout along with some calamari since I did not have time to sit and eat at restaurant today.  I opened up the bag after I came home and was greatly disappointed.  The calamari was all stuck in one piece, extremely greasy and the green sprouts on top was brown.  Then my favorite Shrimp Curry Noodle Soup was terrible today.  It was about half portion of what I would get if I had dined in.  Then no cilantro garnish to go in, the noodles were all clumped as one piece, and NO soup of the day that comes with the lunches when was dining in.  Also when dining in, there is usually 8-9 pieces of shrimp but this only had 5 pieces of smaller sized shrimp.   I was extremely disappointed with the quality and the portion sizes of the Takeout.  I will not be going back to this place ever."}
{"text":"Food was Outstanding!  Service was great... nice attention to detail, friendly, and courteous.   Unfortunately, due to the acoustics in the building... and a large group was sat behind us (about 10-12 people).  They were very... how should I say it... LOUD... to the point that we could not hear each other at my table.  I know that three of the tables commented to their servers... and other than an 'I'm sorry its loud... and in my case a sincere apology', nothing was done. Being in a restaurant background family, it should have been the manager/owner to go to the party table and ask them to tone it down.    I will give Wild Mango another try... the food was that good.  I just hope I am not disappointed again."}
{"text":"Wild Mango is one of the very best restaurants I have ever eaten at.  I go frequently and the service is good, decor is beautiful, and food is consistently awesome.  Love Love Love it there.  I love the Vietnam Salad Bowl it will feed the family! Order it and share it with everyone.  I also love the beef tenderloin, melts in your mouth so good.  Chicken, the seafood bouilibase is totally awesome.  Martini's are filled to the top and mixed perfect.  You will get a strong buz on just one! Great experience everytime I go. Presentation is awesome."}
{"text":"This  has been my favourite restaurant since last year. They have exceptionally good receipes with beautiful presentation and the cost ----VERY LOW. I am forced to write a review after eating food all around US ( in different states) , this one offers exceptionally good food with beautiful ambiance!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with the girls! This is a cozy place, I really liked the atmosphere! I would come here for lunch because the prices are so much lower than dinner, and it's just my college girl ways.   The presentation is really nice, even for lunch. I had the scallops and would totally recommend them. This is a nicer place that's easy on the wallet for lunch."}
{"text":"I like this place. The food portions are larger than I would expect since this place seems to have an image of fancier than normal. Service is great and the food presentation is great. Tastes good too. I had ribs and salmon"}
{"text":"If I can give this restaurant a zero star I totally would!! I called and made my reservation and a woman confirmed and said I was on the list. We showed up on VALENTINES DAY and I was not on the list! What the hell?!?! It was so embarrassing!! Ahhhhhhh NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Wild Mango is decorated beautifully! A not-so-hidden gem in Great Northern Mall. This is a favorite lunch spot for my girlfriends and me when we want to treat ourselves without breaking the bank. An entire meal, which includes a delicious complimentary soup, will cost an average of $15. There is a variety on the menu that's sure to please everyone.  Dinner prices are much higher than lunch but for the fare, the service, and the atmosphere, it's a worthy spend for a special occasion or date night. We're never disappointed.  We called to see if the chef would accommodate a large group and allow us to offer a limited menu for a fixed price and they did! We had a group of 22 ladies attend and everything was absolutely lovely.  I look forward to my next visit where I can try some new menu additions."}
{"text":"My friends took me to Wild Mango for a belated birthday dinner and it was the perfect choice for a fun, relaxing dinner!  Servers were constantly at our table assisting us, filling water glasses, asking if we need anything. The restaurant gives everyone a complimentary appetizer of a seasoned shrimp with a mandarin orange sliver. They also serve you each two different types of breads with a honey chestnut butter that was just a little bit sweet and totally delicious. We shared the chicken potstickers appetizer which were very flavorful. All 3 guests at my table ordered different meals and each item was something I would order again. I especially loved the teriyaki chicken with green beans. We also shared a piece of 14 layer chocolate cake that was literally a work of art. The decor is beautiful, the seating areas are plush and intimate and this is definitely a restaurant I would recommend to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service. The food was amazing from a tender juicy steak with fresh crisp veggies to a fantastic chocolate cake. Money well spent!"}
{"text":"Zero Stars! Let me start by saying that I used to love Wild Mango in North Olmsted. Despite it being inside the mall, I went there and returned because the hospitality was exceptional, the dining room was elegant and cozy, and because the food and service were off the charts. Definitely not so anymore and after last night, I will never return. My folks and I arrived at about 6:40pm and although there was only a moderate amount of people there at that hour, we were asked to wait while two other parties who had reservations were sat first. Not such a big deal, just a little annoying. Then we sat down and service was prompt. Appetizers were mediocre but came quickly. Then dinner arrived: My father and I both ordered the sea bass special which was described as being fresh, baked with little to no butter. It arrived pan fried. It was overcooked. And it was cold. Neither one of us ate it. My mom got the strip steak medium. When it came it was beyond well done. It was a caramelized onion glazed brick. The sides: Sweet potato fries were freezer burned, the rice was overcooked and sweet, and the mixed veggies were more like mush soup than steamed. They must have a different chef or have cut costs because now this restaurant's food is not good at all! The server comped one sea bass and replaced it with a colder seared ahi tuna filet - which I boxed and took home. Even though the bill was $120, I would have been happier getting some Chinese carry out. I don't know if at that point I was just irritated but I noticed that most of the servers and hostesses were pretty rude; they walked in front on my mom because she was moving too slow and cut in front of me in an intersection rather than allowing me to cross or saying \"excuse me.\" Next time I will not make the same mistake again. If I were you I would avoid!!!! You will walk away very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had lunch for the first time and it was phenomenal.  Potstickers were absolutely delicious and salad was good. Sesame chicken was divine in a sweet sauce. Portion size was good for lunch. The complimentary corn and chicken soup was delicious too. Plate presentation is superb."}
{"text":"We met my wife's cousin at Wild Mango for dinner recently and he was impressed with the aesthetic of the restaurant. I told him that the prices are very reasonable, despite it's upscale appearance.  Tonight's service, provided by Angela, was a slightly off. We're used to receiving drinks, menus, bread, and service more quickly. We didn't really mind that much because we were so enveloped in our conversation. But it was still noticeable. We sat for nearly 10 minutes before Angela stopped by our table to take drink orders. Once the orders were taken, the drinks were served in a reasonable amount of time. I didn't dock her tip, but I'll be weary of the service next time.  Bread was not offered to us, so we asked for it. Angela brought a bread dish and offered us whatever we wanted from it and then left with the dish. I guess they're cutting back on the bread most likely because it was going to waste.  My scallops, risotto, and veggies were delicious. I had a glass of Malbec wine, which was really good. I tasted the chicken pot stickers, which were excellent. The shrimp appetizer wasn't nearly as good as I remember.  Overall, the food was great, once again. We'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"My bf and I went there for a date and we were curious about this asian fusion place, because we are usually quite skeptical about asian fusion restaurants.. This place is very fancy looking. We were seated at a secluded place thanks to my bf's reservation. It felt really private. They first served us one small appetizer, it was mango shrimp but really it was simple boiled shrimp with a slice of orange and basil ginger sweet sauce. It was delicious. For appetizer, we ordered the tuna tartar and the Beef Carpaccio. The tuna tartar looked much fancier, has outstanding plating. the quail egg on top was kinda unnecessary but it was a very nice touch. Of course, the tuna tartar has mango in it, which I really liked. I was just very amazed by the two colored sauce base on the bottom. The place they used was kinda like a broad based vase plate. It looked nice but was a little hard to eat with. The beef carpaccio was very nicely made. the cookies were delicious. Although it didn't look as nice as the tuna tartar, it tasted pretty alright. For entree, I had the ahi tuna with crab sauce sticky rice and trio colored cauliflower. I liked the ahi tuna. It was definitely very fresh and  was nicely cooked.  little over done than how I wanted but the wasabi sauce on top has the right consistency. The sticky rice was cooked in creamy crab sauce. You can definitely taste the crab flavor but I thought it was just a little too much, cuz sticky rice tends to make you very full. It was a large amount served. The trio colored cauliflower with other veges was a nice side. Trio color was just a fancy version and taste wise doesn't really do much, but I like to have the fancy cauliflower. My bf ordered chicken three way. I didn't really try it from the beginning so my experience with that dish was kinda fragmented. All i could say was it was heavily asian influenced, maybe didn't bring out the best potential of asian food, but it was a smart thought to cook chicken in three different ways. We didn't order any dessert because we were completely full afterwards. It was very big portions. If you are a fan of asian food and but not crazy about the original style of asian food, this is a great place to go for a fancy date. For me, I would order the tuna tartar and maybe the ahi tuna, but I probably won't go there often. The best thing of the night was really the mango shrimp that came complimentarily. It was definitely a refresher and a strong start of the dining experience."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best meals I've had while in Cleveland. I went to lunch with my friends because they've been coming here for years. The doors open, and it's such a trendy restaurant. The chandelier resembled a Dale Chihuly art. The seating areas were beautiful with plush seating. The bar area had comfy lounge seating, which would be cool to hang out with friends on the weekend.   We started out with the baby calamari. The presentation was beautiful, and the calamari was tender and crispy. The sweet chili sauce was perfect balance of sweet and spicy. I ordered the Salmon with Pesto Sauce and Curry. The presentation was again beautiful; it was like a piece of artwork. The salmon was cooked perfectly, which coupled with the curry sauce was amazing. Lastly, we ordered the tiramisu. Of course, the beautiful presentation with spun sugar on top was amazing. The flavors were well-balanced and complimented the strawberries and blueberries on the plate.   I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here, and it's too bad I'm heading back home. I would definitely come back here if I was to visit Cleveland again. The food, service, and ambiance is comparable to restaurants from Chicago. This place definitely deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful, romantic atmosphere! Every booth is draped with ceiling high curtains. How cozy. Lunch entrees started at $8! Presentation was top notch, food affordable and delish, service great, atmosphere INCREDIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"This is perhaps my most favorite restaurant in the Cleveland area.  I have been going there for several years, since they were in their old location and known as Weia Teia.  It has always been a beautiful experience, and the food is fantastic.  Despite it's somewhat incongruous location (a beautiful, well appointed, high end restaurant-at the mall?) the service, food, and atmosphere have always been top notch, and importantly, never pretentious.   One could spend $30 to $150+ on dinner for two and both meals would be wonderful.    My favorites are the calimari, five-spice roasted duck (this is my favorite duck dish in the world), and the pork ribs, and don't forget dessert."}
{"text":"Wild Mango (please do not confuse with the subpar Wild Ginger) is a truly special, unique place that happens to be surrounded by every generic chain restaurant you can think of in North Olmsted.  Every meal feels like a special occasion at Wild Mango.  I am absolutely in love with the Tofu Curry Noodle Soup. It is a spicy, delicious, creamy (from coconut milk), curried broth with lots of rice noodles, bean sprouts, cilantro and tofu, all served in a gigantic (seriously huge) bowl that makes me feel like Alice in Wonderland in that Tom Petty video. And it's only $8!   The desserts are stunning - edible masterpieces. I loved the beautiful spun sugar halo decoration on the Opera Cake.  The most beautiful, romantic restaurant in the 'burbs..."}
{"text":"My favorite resturant ever!! I'm in love with the Pepsi shrimp and calamari ooo and the sweet potatoe fries any occasion I can get to go I will go! The only thing I can never get full off the delicious apptizers! 4 shrimps for 7$ really?? But their jst so good I usually order 3 orders just for my meal!"}
{"text":"The sink in the bathroom was the highlight for me. It was very zen. The chicken cheesecake was good. I expected it to taste like cheesecake, and was glad that it didn't. I had the sesame chicken. I tried a few bites of the surf and turf. I wish I would have ordered the steak because it was really good. I heard that everything on the menu is good. It is a good place to go out on a date. The booths are nice and private. There is a possibility that you get put in the middle of the room sandwiched between strangers. The interior of the restaurant really impressed me. It was unexpected."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Wild Mango. Every visit that I've had has been excellent. I've recently had the Shrimp Curry Noodle Soup and it nearly brought tears to my eyes when it was gone. The appetizers and cocktails that I've had have all been amazing. The staff is courteous and friendly. I even love the brioche rolls and amuse bouche that come with the meal. No complaints! The last two visits I have eaten in the bar and it's a friend environment and all other patrons agree on the food's wonderful quality!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Sesame chicken is the best I've ever had. I eat here any chance I get."}
{"text":"It's been about two years since our last visit.  I'm not sure why we waited that long?  Once again I was impressed with the food and presentation.  The duck was prepared perfectly, with bok choy, rice, and sweet potato fries.  Desserts were all superb.  We went for a Sunday lunch, where at most restaurants you'd be handed the dinner menu without option.  Here we were given lunch menus, and the average entree was about $10.  Unbelievable, for the level of service, the decor, and the quality of the food.  Taking everything into consideration (food, decor, service, value), this is my favorite restaurant, anywhere, period."}
{"text":"Second time here. Ordered same meal and loved it even more. The fresh cilantro, lemon grass, and shrimp make this soup my favorite soup."}
{"text":"Food presentation was great! Food, not so much. Looks better than it tasted. The waitress was slow and not very attentive."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the price is amazingly good.  Shrimp Curry noodle and chicken cheese cake are both awesome!!"}
{"text":"The decor was nice, low-light, good for a date. The menu however, is a 3ft long wood slate, it will hit the person sitting in front of you if not careful. A little above and beyond in the attempt to be a fancy restaurant, in the mean time an excuse to jack the prices way up!   My salad was 12-13$ and not even that appetizing, or good for that matter. The fact that it is attached to the mall does not help any in my opinion. I am not a fan of N. Olmsted at all, maybe you will find it more suiting to you."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday.  The restaurant is nestled between a McAllister's Deli and Sears.  Behind a Red Lobster.  Inside is upscale Asian with running water on the back wall over a fountain.  Inside the restaurant are tables along a wall.  Where pillows lined the booth portions of the table along walls.  It's pretty nice.  I ordered the Shrimp curry noodle soup.  I was told the chef prepared a complimentary shrimp bisque for me to try first.  Usually when I visit a restaurant with something complimentary I get a sample.  This was an actual bowl of soup.  The broth was a bit thin for bisque, but the flavor packed a punch.  Rich cream, butter, shrimp.  Smalls bits of shrimp were in the soup throughout.  I'm not going to complain since it's free.  It was very good.  The Shrimp curry noodle soup was served with a soup spoon and chopsticks.  This soup was loaded!  There were at least 6 large (21/25 count) shrimp, red bell pepper, onion, sprouts, mushrooms, noodles, and a lemon wedge with cilantro on top.  The bowl was huge.  I couldn't eat it all.  The broth was piping hot and rich.  The curry melded with rich seasonings.  Ginger, coconut.  Simply delicious.  This broth was a bit thin as well.  I can easily overlook that for the flavors exploding out of the bowl.  For a meal that cost just over $8 and some change (including tax) I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Eh, nothing special. The menu feels like it should be more adventurous, but it's really not. It's really just a steakhouse with a slightly (and I mean slightly) Thai kick. I went here because my Dad was really jonesing for some beef and we were in the area.   The decor makes you think that it should be a white tablecloth kind of place but that's a hard thing to pull off when half the silverware is dirty and the menus (all of our table's menus) were dirty. I mean, how does the hostess not even notice the sauce all over the menu? Ew.   Service was fine but nothing to rave about.   Food was okay, but nothing to rave about. My ramen dish thingy was bland and uninspired. Best thing we had was my Dad's cut of beef. That was yummy--but nothing that you can't get somewhere else.  Disappointing, since I was expecting much more from this place based off the reviews."}
{"text":"Ok, so I am an out of towner and had some low expectations when the organizer of the lunch described an asian restaurant in a shopping mall.  I think we all have same stereo-type in mind.  Standard issue decor with the run of the mill institutional restaurant gear.  Boy, was I surprised!!  We were met by a very pleasant, organized hostess.  She knew exactly where our group was and led me right to them.  I always hate when you arrive and the hostess acts like you are speaking Swahili to them.  The decor was beautiful and we were seated in a nice corner that was private without being oppressive.  The menus are on these cool, 2 foot long bamboo planks.    The waitress was great and she very helpful with menu choices, etc.  The food was great, everyone loved their dishes, except me.  I chalk that up to not taking my time and reading all the details of the ingredients.  I failed to see some items that I didn't like in the ingredients.  My fault, not theirs.  The desserts were fantastic.  Can't recall the pricing (but it was reasonable), but was shocked at how visually pleasing and tasty the desserts were.    Overall, I was surprised at the value we received for the price.  Everything from the appetizers to the desserts were reasonably priced for a fine dining experience.  Doesn't happen often, so should be noted when it does."}
{"text":"5 stars, definitely.  We went to this beautiful place last Sunday for lunch. We were the first table (and I made the reservation). The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable.   The first pea and oyster soup was not on the menu ( might be a new item they are trying). Excellent soup followed by crab cake as appetizer and tomato salad (the salad is not on the menu too).  We were almost full when the entree arrived. I ordered a medium rare New York strip which was cooked  exactly as I wanted. However, I think they used the wrong cut because it is so dry. Anyhow, a  glass of good Cab covered the wooden steak.  Surprisingly, we still had room for the wonderful mango cheesecake. It was beautiful plated and tasted great!  Even though the steak is not perfect, I still give them 5 stars. You know what was the best part: it only costs $20/person (excluding the drinks)."}
{"text":"Italian-Asian fusion?  Maybe more kitchen CON-fusion.  Have been here only once---for lunch---so maybe 3 stars aren't really fair without at least another two or three visits.   But after sampling four different menu items, and everything's still fresh in my mind---and mouth---I'm reviewing.  Maybe this was an \"OFF-day\" for Wild Mango, so don't let my words stop you from trying it.    ~ Roasted Duck Breast Unrendered, inedible, fat---about 1/3\" thick covering a good portion of the breast.  Ordered by someone else---not me---so the single taste was enough to confirm it's off-putting fat-fullness and unpleasant taste.  Fat was browned, on top of the meat, so amount of it was unknown--- but lying in wait.  (Should be illegal.)  Most of it should have been trimmed off before roasting, and that portion rendered down in a separate sauce pan.  As far as flavor---maybe too much hoisin, or the alcohol in the vodka not burned/roasted off---or both.    ~ Sweet Potato Fries My first time.  Had to finally try it---out of curiosity---given it's popularity and appearance on probably every restaurant menu.   Has it made its debut at McD's yet?  Or were they the ones who started it.  Mushy and starchy.  No surprise really---exactly what I expected.  I prepare this fabulous vegetable myself, but a candied version with butter and brown sugar.  It may not be as healthful, but the traditional preparation with those unhealthy flavorful extras tastes so much better.  The humble, nutritious, tasty sweet potato---a veritable starch bomb---BEGS for other additions to cut into that dense, gummy, fiberous texture to make it palatable.  For all I know, Wild Mango's might be the best around, but my first two-fry sample was also my last---here or anywhere else.     ~ Vietnamese Salad Bowl . . . aka Just-Grab-What-You-Can-and-Throw-it-into-This-Bowl Salad Yikes.  Ten...maybe FIFTEEN ingredients.  Alright---I'm exaggerating a bit---but this WAS overkill.  Each element on their own---about 7 or 8, plus dressing---was fine, perfectly acceptable.  But all TOGETHER it didn't work well for me.  I do kind of the same thing---fridge fusion---when we're trying to consume the few prepared odds and ends from the refrigerator that have accumulated over two or three days---but mine have better results.   I just can't get into cold rice noodles, cold leafy greens, cold shrimp, and cold chicken (very good, 4 stars) spring rolls.  Yes...I read the description before I ordered, and liked each and every item.  It was my MIND that wasn't paying close enough attention that this was a COMBINATION served in ONE bowl.  Just too many things going on, that whoever prepped it forgot the dressing.  No problem---this is NOT a complaint.  Asked for the black rice vinaigrette---rather than the lime whatever---and it was delicious.  If available, I'd recommend these Spring Rolls with black rice for dipping.  ~ Tiramasu Talk about SPONGE cake.  This poor thing soaked up W-A-Y too much liquid.  (Whoever prepped the cake didn't remove it in time.)  I've had a *few* in my day---including my own (very good) and---5 or 6 years ago---Romano's Macaroni Grill (exceptional !...yeah, an evil chain) but this was a mistake, for sure.  Perfect flavor, but wet, soft, and mooooshy.  It should be moist, but have SOME body, and not be a limp liquidy mass.  ~ JOSH Our server.  Friendly, smiling, knowledgeable, personable...cute, too.  5 Star.  ~ Background Jazz Smooth...cool...at a perfect volume.     ~ Interior Sleek and upscale. (Click their site.)  Ask for a booth if you'd like a little privacy."}
{"text":"I went on Sunday, June 9, 2014 at about 730 pm.   The service was terribly slow, not just for me but for everybody and the restaurant was not crowded.  It even took too long to bag my leftovers.  The wait between courses or service was unacceptable.  But the food was good.  The appetizer seemed to have sat and gotten a little cold before being brouwght to the table.   The ladies room needed attention and I told the waitress, she said they would take care of it but the didn't by the time I left and all they had to do was pick up paper towels and put in a wastebasket.  Yuk"}
{"text":"I've been to Wild Mango several times. It's seems to be the go-to for my parents for a \"fancy\" restaurant.   This place is outside the mall, but when you walk in the decor is pretty fancy looking. Kind of an odd dynamic - but not a bad thing.   The food here is always pretty good. The service is \"meh.\"  Whenever we come here, they always manage to sell us on the appetizer sampler which is delicious I have to admit. It comes with calamari, tuna tartar, potstickers, and shrimp. It's a pretty impressive little spread. It also costs just as much as one of the entrees, which is fine because there is a lot of food, but just a warning.   The last time I came here with the fam, I had the scallops dish. Came with mushrooms and a crab risotto. The crab risotto was the best part of the meal. So rich tasting and it was perfectly cooked. I also shared the strip steak with my husband. Huge portion, also cooked to perfection. The presentation of the dishes here is always impressive. Very pretty.   Another favorite is the chicken trio. It comes with this \"chicken cheesecake\" which is really delicious. If you haven't had that dish yet, you need to order it.   I'd pass on the duck here. It's not that its bad, but seems that I've had other things on their menu which I have enjoyed more.   As I said, the service is \"meh\". It can be a bit slow, not slow in the \"i'm pacing your meal well\" but slow as in you don't get a refill on the water for quite a while.   Overall though, I like this place. The food is good. Prices are decent (on the higher side but pretty standard for the type of food and the portions). And, it's in a really convenient location."}
{"text":"My wife, Gillian takes me here on my birthday...  A bit pricey but the food and the decor is worth it.....  Love this place..."}
{"text":"Interesting food and atmosphere. I found it to be delicious. I would go back.  I ordered the surf and turf and the vegetables were great with it . I'm sure you were not expecting the review to be about the vegetables but I liked the flavor a lot. The steak and shrimp were  also flavorful."}
{"text":"From reading some of the reviews I was excepting a fine dining experience and was sorely disappointed ... Wild mango captivates with its decor but when it comes to the real \"meat and potatoes\" of it its on par with your local applebees  We arrived on a Saturday night with no reservation. They were accommodating and told us it would just be a min as they prepared a table. The entrance way was impressive with vaulted ceilings, dark hardwood doors, and blown glass light fixtures. While admiring the decor two customers walked out from the dining hall disgusted. Come to find out that while the one lady was eating her salad a fairly large green bug proceeded to walk out from it. Being hardcore foodies and quite hungry we decided to stick it out (mistake).   We ordered the calamari which was mediocre at best. Then the drinks arrived which ended up being the best part of the whole experience, they were very strong. Next came the salad ours contained no bugs and were actually pretty good. For dinner I ordered the Surf n Turf in which I was exceptionally dissatisfied. It comes out with four fried shrimp on a bed of powdered mashed potatoes, one scallop, and a steak drowned in teryaki sauce for $38 (total food cost on that plate was maybe $12). And finally came the dessert a lava cake with fruit on top of it. It was disgusting.   In short Wild Mango has the food quality you would expect from a restaurant attatched to a mall but with prices more in line with real four star dining. Don't waste your money its not worth it."}
{"text":"It was my birthday and my choice of the restaurant, so Wild Mango was the destination for our group.  We had ordered a combination of appetizers, and, due to food allergies, the chef came out to our table to discuss options.  He made me a separate plate, no additional charge. All of the food was divine.    The service was a bit slow, but not enough to warrant a lesser rating.  We'd return any time we're back in the Cleveland area."}
