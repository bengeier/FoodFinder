{"text":"I went here last week. It was pricey and the staff was rude. I did not feel like it was a welcoming environment. The food was mediocre at best. I will not be coming back and don't recommend anyone  to go here."}
{"text":"This place used to be decent but now it's complete crap. The price for food here is ridiculous Especially considering the portion size. On top of that the service is terrible. I highly recommend you don't visit this place."}
{"text":"First time here for the breadfast?they send the newspaper for free?thats good for kill the time. Actually not too much choice for breadfast?but reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and it was full, but we only had to wait for about 5 minutes before a table freed up.   We were provided with the lunch menu (11:30 to 5:30) and the afternoon tea menu (2:30 to 5:30), along with the regular menu.   We ordered:   Baked Portuguese chicken with spaghetti from the lunch menu, which came with a soup and hot drink. The portion was smaller than average but it tasted pretty good.   Guilin soup noodle from the afternoon tea menu, which came with a hot drink. I think the afternoon tea portion is supposed to be smaller than the one from the regular menu, but we were given the full-sized bowl by mistake and by the time the server realized her mistake, we had already finished eating it! After realizing this, I wouldn't order it again because it is about half the size of the regular bowl - so beware!   Food was okay, but it is more expensive than your average HK style cafe. I would only come back out of convenience."}
{"text":"Originally I gave them a very good review. Thought food, pricing and service was pretty okay. But returned to an awful plate of curry lamb. It tasted like freezer. Curry came with tofu skin and shiitake mushroom - quite an acquire creativeness to the dish that I have yet experienced until that day. The dish was cold and tasted like another dish (braised lamb pot) with last minute weak amount of curry powder. I was only able to take a few bites and left the food alone. I didn't think it was necessary to complain and would pack it home to modify it. Instead the restaurant complained to me instead.   Funny. I asked to switch out the rice to more veggies and I specifically said I don't mind adding money. It was done a few times before when I visited, that's also why I came back since I don't want to waste the rice or spaghetti. Server came back mid meal and told me I should not do it again because I got her in trouble. I felt instantly bad for her and the confusion combination of ingredient in my food.   Don't plan  to go back. Not when I had confusion (curry?) lamb that taste like another dish (braised lamb pot) fresh from the freezer."}
{"text":"This place has some really awesome choices for lunch and afternoon tea specials.  You can't go wrong with their signature Macau pork chop sandwich or my favorite salted pork trotter.  Afternoon specials, for every 3 meals you order you get the 4th for free.  Woot!  A nice clean comfortable setting.   It's not a fancy restaurant but it's awesome for the price and taste.  It reminds me of Macau style quick foods with a Hong Kong style twist, plus a few more variety on the menu to satisfy different needs.   No MSG so far with the usual dishes I order.  No MSG is very important, since I am out of commission for the rest of the day which I absolutely hate!  Since I can't have carbs, they allow switching out my rice/spaghetti with vegetables.  The amount of vegetables they gave me was huge! Really appreciate that!  Prior to my low carb, I used to enjoy their fried fish fillet! Amazing! It's a whole fillet.  I remember how it was fried to perfection, the type where it's nice and hot inside and out.  Most importantly the meat is not wet!! Most bars can't get that right.  Combo that up with their tasty tomato sauce instead of serving you ketchup makes it so much tastier!!!!   Pricing is decent all day long.  Exceptional if you order from their special menu.  The drinks are a bit pricy to order on its own.  But if it comes along with the lunch or afternoon tea special menu it's not a concern.   The service is always polite.  They sometimes have new servers in training so it's understand if it's not always quick and precise."}
{"text":"WARNING: DO NOT COME TO THIS RESTAURANT! I came today and ordered fried noodles, the whole plate came completely burned! I smelled the burned noodles from miles away, took a bite and its burned as fuck! Asked the waitress to swap a plate and she said the manager says no.   It's a completely burned dish! How ridiculous!   I will never come to this restaurant ever again! I would've gave it 0 stars if I can."}
{"text":"We had it to go, so not sure what service is like in person but over the phone, they were courteous.     Food tasted good.   The spaghetti bolognese (Hong Kong style) was very meaty, as opposed to be saucy.   It came with drink & soup even with takeout.  Though I agree with another reviewer, it's pricey compared to other Hong Kong Style Cafes, ...so that deters me from revisiting.  I can think of one other HK style Cafe that I know tastes better and is priced more competitively... If they were located next to Golden Horse, ...I would no doubt select the other option instead."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is always meet my expectations. Bake pork chop, beef tongue and beef chow fan are great. I particular love their red bean shave ice with ice cream. That reminds my childhood  favorite."}
{"text":"My go-to hk style cafe in Markham. There are quite a few hk style cafes around the area but something always brings me back to Golden Horse. Their staffs are always friendly and the food for me has always been on point.   It's very spacious inside with a lot of booth seating which I really like. Students get a free bubble tea drink with your meal if you show your student ID.   They have a wide selection of food items on their menu that I have yet to try, so I'll definitely continue to return to Golden Horse."}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast around 10:30am and it was fairly busy inside. Ordered satay beef with vermicelli in soup $5.50 and got the hot milk tea. Nice portion size- large bowl with lots of noodles, beef and some cabbage too. Beef was tender, pieces were mostly bigger than bite size and both soup and sauce were tasty. I always like some type of veg in my soup to help cut through the sauciness so the cabbage was good. Was with a friend and took our time so didn't have an issue with service. Staff was friendly and restaurant was clean. Lots of booth seating. Would like to try the french toast next."}
{"text":"We always get takeout from golden horse where they've been consistent and timely in their execution! The only con I have of this place is their prices are more expensive than most hk style cafes! If I want my iced milk tea and noodle fix, this is my go to for the convenience!  Buddy noodles are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Good food, fair service with a higher than usual HK style Cafe restaurant for the Markham area. I have visited this place a regularly in the past. They have things that they are well know for and I really enjoy them. Fried pork chop burger is delicious and their Guiling style noodles are really well made. Their service is not the best although I do find some servers to be friendlier than others. I think their menu is higher than your average HK style places but this is most likely due to the fact that you get wifi and their menu looks nicer. Overall, I would recommend it for the food quality and portion but don't expect great service."}
{"text":"This is our usual 'go to place' when we can't think of any other places to eat.  I love their sticky rice esp. because there are no dry shrimps.  My son loves to order their french toast.  Other than that, it's pretty much your standard Chinese restaurant that's a lil on the pricey side.  One time I tried to switch up my order for breakfast and got their chow mein noodles and congee for a change, they forgot my order and when it finally came (approx 45 mins later) the chow mein noodles were burnt/tasted like a dirty wok.  Update:  ordered a dish with broccoli & found a piece of hair in it today... ewwwww"}
{"text":"Offers great Hong Kong cha chan tang food. The classics such as bolognese spaghetti and fried French toast are excellent. I won't rate the place as 5 stars because the lighting is really dim in the restaurant and the place smells. The restaurant offers traditional Chinese dish (smelly bamboo shoot) that appeals to the older generation. However, the smell can be quite overwhelming and unappetizing. You can definitely smell it once you enter the restaurant."}
{"text":"The quality has really been going down over the years. We used to love this place. The food is pretty much a hit or miss. My favourite was the fried vermicelli with preserved pickles, tomato, and minced pork. Once they served it without adding salt. Another time the tomato has gone bad. I still come here occasionally because I really love their vermicelli when it is done right."}
{"text":"Got takeout and the portions were ridiculously small.   Ordered seafood chow mien and there was about 3 shrimp, 2 squid, 2 pieces of scallops, 2 imitation crab sticks and a couple mushrooms.  No beef or chicken like it's supposed to have (it's in a picture of a review of their location). I'm assuming it was a friend or family member who ordered it an posted the review because the amount of food I got wasn't even 1/3rd of the amount of food there.   The price is decent, it's not overpriced but for the amount of food you get it's cheaper to go to a more expensive place that would give you way larger portions."}

{"text":"Slightly on the pricier side, but the food is absolutely delicious! Amazing Chinese comfort food and decent service. Yes the servers may be a bit rude but the food comes fast!   I recommend their baked rice dishes, but it does come slightly slower than the rest."}
{"text":"Busy Hong Kong Style Cafe  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food (2: OK) The menu is huge and the food is generally okay; we have been here many times and have noticed that they down size the serving portion slightly.  Service (1: Poor) The servers try to take the order quickly. However, they basically ignore the customers after the food are delivered to the table. It takes forever to get the bill and the change back.  Ambiance (2: OK) Dimly lit dining room, casual, very busy all day on the weekends, extremely noisy and waiting line could be long on the weekends. There is a waiting area which is separated from the dining room at the entrance.   Surroundings (2: OK) Located at a strip plaza on the north side of Highway 7 about 200 meters west of Kennedy Rd. in Markham. The parking lot is busy; it could be difficult to find a parking space during business hours on weekdays because the restaurant is on the same building as a Service Ontario Centre, next to a falafel & shwarma restaurant, and adjacent to a Japanese restaurant and other shops. Fortunately, there is another parking lot at back of the plaza."}
{"text":"There are having a promotion now. For afternoon tea, purchase three meals and get the fourth one free. At dinner time, for purchase over $30, you can get one dish free."}
{"text":"??? another Hong Kong style cafe ???. Used to be Golden Horse ?? but changed names. Menu changed a bit but has all the food you'd get at any other cafes plus more Asian style cuisine like stir fries, baked casseroles, Guailam style noodles etc. They do have Hong Kong style milk tea and the rare ones like ?? and ??? if you ask for extra charge of course. They have lunch, dinner and hi tea ??? specials during their set hours.  Basically cheaper price for a main that includes a drink (and soup).   The service is okay, food comes relatively fast and good portions. Not bad for a quick meal in and out. Bathrooms not the cleanest but its doable. You can preorder your food for take out pick up. They're number is (905) 940-3288. Parking gets tricky sometimes, may have to park a bit further. Getting out of the plaza may be hard to make a left towards Mccowan at times from the on coming traffic in hwy 7.   Overall I come here for food often especially for their hi tea menu. Check out the pictures i uploaded."}
{"text":"Your very typical HK Style Cafe with mediocre service and so-so food. We got the satay beef instant noodle which comes with a drink. Portions are large so keep that in mind and consider sharing. Prices are reasonable (~$5-6 for our combo).   They do get quite busy so try and beat the rush by avoiding prime time."}
{"text":"My family really likes this place and I cannot figure out why. Maybe because I don't like Chinese food in general (check my check-ins haha).  I ordered a potato noodle with lamb meat (my mom bullied me into ordering it actually), she got the sticky rice and my brother got the pork chop sandwich. The food is alright I mean, if I'll eat it if I'm hungry but if I had a choice, I would definitely not come here."}
{"text":"Really like this location compared to hwy7 and kennedy one. Really detailed decorated in the store. Very Macau like with a touch of some casino look alike decorations. Clean and new. Servers are well dressed in cleaned uniform and well manner. Knowledgable and very attentative   Fast food restaurant, decent prices and so far the noodles I had there were pretty amazing compared to ones around the area. Personally this location is really close to me, so it is very convenience.   Lunch specials everyday, also they have buy 4 meals get 1 meal free (dine in only). Dinner special was free Guilin noodle with purchase of $30 or $40 dollars.   Flavorful, good price, neighborhood restaurant!   Definitely return for more."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Free Chinese newspaper and TVs is a bonus. However the breakfast wasn't anything better than an average homemade one. Their famous Macau style porkchop bun was over rated. I'm wasn't expecting Macau standards, but I've had better in Toronto."}
{"text":"OMG I've been coming here for at least 15 years since I was a little kid with my parents (even way pre renovation and with different management I think).  This is my absolute favorite HK cafe. The food portions are large, and I haven't had any failed dishes yet. The taste is better than other places. The HK milk tea is also pretty strong.... just the way I like it.  I like their tea time specials because almost full size dishes + drink costs no more than $6 for a really hearty meal.  Can't go wrong with the food.  Sometimes when it is busy it can get pretty dirty though..."}
{"text":"Macau Street or Golden Horse Restaurant? Lost in translation?   Food: I've come here two different times and I've ordered the baked pork chop with rice and the chicken steak in black peppercorn sauce with spaghetti and vegetables. The baked pork chop with rice is what they are known for and it was delicious. However, the chicken steak in black peppercorn sauce was a letdown. The vegetables smelled like they came from a fish market. The chicken was a bit burnt on the top and was not to my liking. The HK milk tea is alright and nothing too out of the ordinary.  Service/Atmosphere: The service was quick like a usual HK style cafe. Food comes out fast and you will be eating within 5-10 minutes after you put your order in. The atmosphere is alright but I noticed this eerie sour smell on both of my visits which was not pleasant when you are eating your meal. I do not know what that smell is but it isn't welcoming.   Yep, it is just another HK cafe opening up in the Richmond Hill area."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese fare, lunch specials are great however their prices are high considering the type of dishes they offer, this is expected since its Richmond Hill so I wouldn't knock off a star for that as they are on par with the rest of the restaurants nearby. Just note a 7 min drive south will get you much better bang for your buck for the same food. Lunch combos come with soup and hot drink (typical upgrade to cold for extra $$).  I like that when you get take out they separate all their sauces from the meats in different containers which keep better for transport. The other few Chinese restaurants in the area do not do that.  Not a very English friendly place as all the servers speak very little English however the menu is all in English/Chinese so its not that difficult to order."}
{"text":"Location/Service - Along Highway 7, west of Kennedy. It's in a small plaza, corner location - Parking available within plaza (and behind the back as well), but it does get pretty busy during peak hours - I think recently they slightly upgraded their interior (painting for example), looks a bit more welcoming and friendly. But overall typical standard place - Staff are generally okay, not overly rude but not too enthusiastic either  Food - Typical standard HK Cafe restaurant - Wide variety of menu items, from baked rice to fried noodles to fried snacks, sandwiches - The do monthly/daily special, for the month of June 2018 - Onion Pork Chop Rice for $6.99 - Includes soup of the day + coffee/tea drink - Portion wise is not bad, filling for lunch - sauce quantity is enough and the pork chops were thin and easy to chew on - Pretty sweet deal for a quick meal - I have tried their other items, overall it's pretty okay standard. If you crave HK cafe, this is one of the place you can choose from"}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to spot for HK cafe style food. I would definitely recommend during their afternoon tea times. The same amazing food, off a smaller menu, for an even better price. My favorites include their pork cutlet sandwich/bun, French toast, and guilan style noodles. Their afternoon tea also comes with a drink. Afternoon tea is from approximately 2:30-5:30."}
{"text":"I used to go to the original Golden Horse on Hwy 7 at Kennedy when I was younger. A lot younger. This place has been around, even though it's changed names a few time. It used to be called Sweet Heart Cafe, while it's Chinese name was Golden Horse. Now it's English name is Golden Horse, while it's Chinese name is Macau Street. Confused yet? Yeah, me too.  Regardless, the place has done well for itself. It's probably changed owners as the dishes are different, but the value is still quite good. I miss when they used to have cream soups (I find not a lot of HK cafes give out the Chinese-style cream soups these days), and my baked spaghetti came completely covered in sauce instead of just a pile on top now.  We went for lunch recently at this location, and they have a lunch special where you order 5 lunches and one of them (the cheapest one) is free. Each lunch comes with a soup (either borscht or Chinese-style) and an HK coffee / tea. The food was good, and the portions are large, so we had a lot of food left over (4 adults and a kiddo).   The wait for us was insane though. We had called ahead of time to reserve a table in the morning, and when we got there, we still had to wait an extra 20 minutes as they had no tables available at all, and were not keen on putting together small tables as they became free to accommodate our larger group of 5 (especially when they had several walk-ins with party sizes of 2 - 4). They had probably 3 tables max that could hold 6 people, so we had to wait for one of those to free up. Certainly a frustrating experience for us, even though I know they were very busy taking care of the tables they had already seated.  Would I come here again? Maybe. I'd love for better service, and then I'll certainly reconsider."}
{"text":"This used to be a regular HK Cafe spot for me a long time ago in the mid-90s. Despite changing the decor and its Chinese name, it's kept the same English name and updated their menu a bit.   Overall - decent food, okay service. The people seem really unhappy working here. You ask for things and they don't acknowledge you as they walk away, so you're never sure if they got your order. You wait for your dishes, and you just hope that they put your order in or didn't forget about you. No one smiles.   The food is decent though - they've got good lunch specials that come with a soup and a drink for under $8. The portions are large - so I always have enough to take home.  They take credit card, and you should probably make a reservation if you're going during peak food times - the place is packed!"}
{"text":"With this being the newer Golden Horse Restaurant, it is definitely larger, nicer, and more spacious. Having been to the Highway 7 location quite a few times, this one was a new stop for me.  Parking is still pretty tight, as there are more spots in general, but with lots happening in the plaza, it doesn't make for tons of spots. Fortunately, with a bigger restaurant apace, you can seat more people. The decor seems more modern and is nicely lit, but that was about as nice as this place got compared to the other.   The food was average, but the curry wasn't as good, with the meat a bit too chewy and the rice I got was very, very oily. It is also insane that they have an extra charge for absolutely everything. Want to change a portion of the meal? Its about $1 (or more). Drinks come with the meals, but if you want it cold on a hot day, its an extra $1.50! I know they add a bit for cold drinks everywhere, but some places will give you the cold drink for half of that. That's just absurd!  Service wasn't the greatest either. They weren't very nice, gave me a sense of laziness, and didn't have much communication between each other.   Don't think I'll be back here as there is a better location about 2 blocks south."}
{"text":"We are 3 people and go there for dinner. They have afternoon offer before 4pm or 5pm (not sure). We buy 3 dishes and get anther one free. That's a good deal for a small group. And I like the trotter in salt."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for afternoon tea and dinner. They have everything a typical HK cafe would serve. Their Cordon Bleu dish is pretty good. My most recent visit, I got the pork chop in onion gravy sauce with rice. This dish is on promo for $6.99 (regular price $14.50) until June 30, so hurry and get the deal! It says dine-in only, but I couldn't finish it so I wanted a take out box. Make sure you finish your dish because they charged me $1 extra to take out just because it's a dine-in special. Service is decent, could be better."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhhm I don't know, where should I start?  The fact that the vast majority of my friends are Asian (some were born here, some in mainland China or HK), and the fact that I've travelled extensively in south east Asia tells me that over the years I can now distinguish good from bad food/cuisine from Asia in general.   And Golden Dragon is defined what I would NOT define as good Asian food - HK style.   Came here on a bday dinner party. Aware of the fact that this is HK style and on a budget, I have to be honest, I wasn't expecting a royal type of food, but at least, decent.   While browsing the menu I already having a \"taste\" of very strange combos that thankfully I get reassured isn't Chinese HK style AT ALL.   So I decided to play safe: no smoked salmon and shredded chicken (urgh @.@) but curry beef and rice.   The rice was the only decent thing out of everything. Yes, because the rest of the plate felt terribly blend. If Steve Wonder would have a taste of it, I believe he would've thought that he was having some pieces of cardboard marinated in a tasteless thick unknown sauce.  Being flavourless and without even a pinch of salt,  I tried to look at the bright side of the situation: \"maybe, and here I say it again, MAYBE, the plate taste so bland because there's no MSG......which is awesome\"!  Other people ordered other items, mostly from the special menu. A special order is an item where you get a main course along with a tiny soup and a choice between tea or coffee.   Feedback wasn't much different than mine which then led me to the conclusion that maybe this restaurant isn't a very good value of your time and money (despite isn't too expensive) if you like food.   If you are the type of eater that sees food just as a way to get you full, then go ahead, come here and order anything your eyes like.   In my opinion, despite the service is cordial, prompt and fairly fast, I wouldn't consider this as a lunch/dinner destination especially when I'm in an area like Richmond Hill/Markham where I can get far better food that won't do wrong to my tastebuds and digestive system.   Sorry :(  D"}
{"text":"Standard Hong Kong style cafe with the standard Hong Kong style breakfast menu. Having eaten in the restaurant and have done take out, the quality is pretty consistent in quantity. The satay beef does lack an intense flavour beyond the flavours of salt and MSG. However, the sparse amount of green vegetables is a nice addition. You can elect to order sandwiches on top of your warm entree for $2. The sandwich itself is quite filling, with two eggs and a substantial amount of ham. Nothing particularly unique about this Hong Kong style cafe, however, I do prefer the quality and portions of Golden Horse over other establishments such as Pheonix."}
{"text":"There's this waitress called Irene who was very rude. Didn't make us feel welcome at all. We had to tell them three times to give us our drinks. The food is so-so."}
{"text":"This is probably, I mean it most definitely is, my favourite Hong Kong style cafe. From delicious food to great service, this place will not disappoint. It is a restaurant with a wide range of food, such as traditional Chinese food to fusion dishes. One of my favourite dishes is the baked pork chop on rice. This dish has a big piece of fried pork chop on a bed of fried rice and everything is topped with a creamy tomato sauce and baked with cheese Even typing this post has me craving this dish. Come visit this restaurant for food that will never disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Every time we came here we always order steak and another dish so out little one year old can eat! So every time we order pasta! We order a meat with rose sauce, smoke Salmon with pasta and the most recent time is fish with spinach white sauce with pasta ....Their pasta has never failed and needless to say the steak as well!!  Their borscht soup is well made and the bread is always fresh. Although we don't go there that often but because I went their a few times during my pregnancy and after the little one arrived. One of the waitress there remembers us so we get free soup for the little one... Service is not the best as some reviewed but we get treated well! But parking can get a little crazy and they do get really busy during dinner rush..."}
{"text":"My go to place for HK Style Cafe Food and it's usually a 30min drive but they are usually quite consistent. The prices are very budget friendly and the service and food exceed the price that they are charging. My recommendation usually follows or rotate as -GaiYuan Toast -House Special Pork Chop Rice -Fish Fillet Bun -Chicken Steak with Peppercorn Gravy on Spaghetti -Oxtail in a Rose Sauce -Portuguese Casserole on Rice  Service is polite and quite efficient"}
{"text":"I gotta say for this restaurant, the food is ok. But the reason I am giving this a two stars, is because of the price you paid vs the quality of food you get. And mind you I do categorized myself as the type of customer who prefer quality over $$. But i think what this restaurant offered is abit expensive. For example, a \"mixed grill on the hot iron pan\", it cost $28... while I can get it from other similar restaurants in the same category for less than $15. Yes, the quality is better but not worth this big jump of price using my price/performance scale. It is subjective but this is how I feel. I would put this restaurant in the category of \"I have given it a try - it's not bad - but I probably wont go again\", because there are many other substitutes out there...  If you haven't been to this restaurant, give it a try as the food is not bad, maybe their pricing won't impact you as much as it had impacted me."}
{"text":"Taking over the spot where the Kenny's used to be is a new location of the Golden Horse Restaurant in Markham. It offers all of the typical HK style cafe food and the menu seems to be identical to the other location as well.  Service was prompt and the food came out fast which I was surprised considering they had just opened maybe a day or two ago. Ordered the Portuguese chicken baked rice, curry beef brisket and rice, deep fried tofu with spicy salt, and a plate of gai lan. The food was pretty consistent with the other location in terms of how it was cooked and plated and taste wise everything was good though nothing really exceeded my expectations either.   Pricing is a little more expensive compared to other HK cafes maybe due to the nicer décor though décor is the last thing I'm looking for when it comes to HK cafes (the dirtier the better to me!). Overall it's not a bad option, I'd recommend the guilin noodles which I've had numerous times at the other location, and it's still a welcome replacement to the old Kenny's which went downhill a looooong time ago."}
{"text":"Didn't realize Kenny's gourmet was closed down until tonight. I believe they just opened, so there's a huge sign on the window saying \"soft opening\" (whatever that means lol). This location looks so much better than the one on Kennedy/hwy 7. The decor looks nice, kind of modern. There are two big screen TVs mounted to high up to the wall which was perfect where I was sitting. Surprisingly, both was airing the Jay's game and not a Chinese drama/channel lol. Service was kind of slow because there were a lot of people, so it'll get better in time. Or they need to hire another person to wait tables.  The food was pretty good and the menu was huge! The Kennedy location never had such a big menu. I felt kind of overwhelmed looking at it. There were Chinese food, baked foods, English foods, sandwiches, soups, noodles, steaks, ribs, drinks and alcohol. Out of all the dishes, I chose curry chicken... Lol typical me.  Ok, the curry chicken wasn't a bad choice. This was typical Chinese curry, which wasn't strong but I feel like they threw in more spice than other places. I'm a huge fan of curry (red, yellow, green, Indian, Chinese, Malaysian, Thai). The curry was on thing, but the chicken was made pretty darn well. They were mostly white meat and the chicken was tender to he bite, not dry or rough. The dish came out smokin' hot, which probably made it spicier than it should be.  I also ordered the sour and spicy soup. It came last, so I wasn't very happy with that. I imagined it would come in the beginning, so I can prepare my stomach for the feast. Oh well, no big deal!  No matter how good the food was, the service was just too slow. Perhaps it'll get better, or maybe not. We'll see when u revisit this place. It was also super humid/hot inside, so that didn't help the overall score for this place. Not like it wasn't hot enough today already... Lol"}
{"text":"Come here once in a while. Used to come here more often but the prices keep increasing, service getting worse and parking here is really bad.  My husband always gets the old buddies soup noodles. I personally don't like the soup base, it smells bad because of the bamboo shoots, that they put in it. But my husband likes the taste. I usually get the fried fish cutlet with rice. My husbands' food always comes first and he has usually eaten at least 80% by the time my food comes. It really peeves me off, as I'm a slow eater anyways. This place is usually always packed at lunch and you might need to wait for a table. Food is decent but if you're spending at least $9 + tax and tip, for lunch specials, there's lots of other options around."}
{"text":"Meh. Another mediocre HK cafe. The interior is so run down and looks like its from the '90s. The food is overpriced compared to other newer, more modern HK cafes. Service is what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. I came here coz another restaurant I wanted to go to was too packed, this place makes me wish I had waited in line instead.   I had the tofu with fish on rice, it was very underwhelming and for $11+ tax, better off going to congee Wong or keungs delight."}
{"text":"This place is basically a HK fast food, but I think I've had better. They've earned my first 1 star rating!!!   The baked pork chop on rice was just fried rice with tomato soup and melted cheese, not exactly what I call baked.  The deep fried chicken wings with fries ($5.25) had more oil than the fryer!  MSG was at an all time high! HK style milk tea and lemon coke just didn't cut it.   Well I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.  (I'll be at the other places fixing my impression of HK fast food!)"}
{"text":"Golden Horse Restaurant is a typical Hong Kong Style Cafe where you can grab a quick bite to eat if you are looking for a quick lunch or snack. I began coming to this place 2 1/2 years ago and I have been very impressed with the food every time I have dined at this place.   The inside of the restaurant is very spacious. The decor of the place is quite typical of what you would expect to see in a Hong Kong Style Cafe, but there is a nice setting with the dim lights inside the restaurant to create a warm touch to the dining experience.  In terms of the food, there are many great dishes that you can choose from. I would definitely recommend the Baked Portuguese Style Chicken on Rice as it is creamy and rich in flavour which compliments nicely with the simple egg fried rice and tender chicken.  Another item I certainly would recommend is  Minced Pork Noodles in Soup in Guilin Style. The bowl may look simple, but there is a combination of flavours in the broth especially. It is the right amount of saltiness, sourness, and spiciness which is like a festival in your mouth.   Definitely come check out this place if you are looking for a simple meal at a reasonable price with your family and friends."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? I used to come here quite often when they first opened.. came here recently and it was underwhelming in comparison to their opening days. They used to have a \"Buy 4 meals, get 1 free\" or \"Order $30+ get...\" for lunch & afternoon teas, but that's no more. I remember when we used to walk in here, it reeked of bamboo shoots from their famous Guilin noodles (it was a good stink), and that's gone too. All of the appealing factors.. were gone. I noticed a fresh coat of light green paint to give the place a brighter look. The interior lighting is weird.. it gave my food a greenish tinge which felt really unnatural. I noticed a new menu, same staff, so probably a change in management.   On their new menu, the lunch set varieties have decreased. They have a new \"Special Set\" menu which consists of your typical HK all day breakfast items like toast, egg, ham, soup noodle combo for a GREAT price of $10.99+tax. Even though it was sorta overpriced, my mom ordered it anyway bc she had to get her HK staples lol. Thinking that maybe they'll up the game a little considering the price.. nope. It was nothing special; it was honestly something I could've done up at home and maybe customized it even better :( The rest of our food was not bad, but not great either. Their HK milk tea, I'd give it an A, it's pretty good. Nothing wrong with the service.. A very mediocre experience, but because I knew what this used to be, hence the rating. My family agreed unanimously not to come here anymore as there are better options around with better competing prices."}
{"text":"Open later than most HK cafe in the immediate area. So perfect for late night dinner. However they don't offer free soup or hot drink (milk tea/coffee) like others. Taste and portion are spot on, looks small on the dish they use, but will defiantly fill you up."}
{"text":"Super bad service with giving table in reverse to other group, as my family was the first group in the table queue. They finally offered a table for us, and kids of my family seated. A waitress came over and yelled them to get up, and need to return this table for another reservation group. But I heard this waitress told that group already with this fast food restaurant doesn't provide reservation service at all, only in the other branch. Funny! How good manner with this! Never go back of course!"}
{"text":"I tried his restaurant a few times now and this is one of the best for Chinese food. The service is good with manners. Speaks Cantonese . The food are not cheap. They use a lot of everything in you dish. I have to say it's a 5 star for the price."}
{"text":"Don't think they're as good as they used to be, but I still really love the pork cutlet bun ????The food comes relatively fast in fairly large portions. Comimg here several times, I noticed that each waiter is different in terms of their level of politeness. One of them is extremely well mannered, while another waiter was extremely rude."}
{"text":"Came here once and the first time the service was absolutely horrible. It was very slow and they didn't even have a lot of people. Expect to wait at least 10 min until you get your bill. Their food quality was ok.  Fast forward a few months, I decided to come back a second time to see if they improved their service or changed their menu. Got chicken wings and salad on the side just to be safe. Now the server asked me 2 times if I wanted chicken wings and salad and I've confirmed with her \"yes, that's what I want\". What arrived was chicken wings and FRIES. The ratio of fries to chicken was very appalling. Didn't expect to get 4 wings and a dump of fries. Was expecting more than 4 wings. TBH.  I also asked for a chocolate float because why not? It's hot and I want a cold drink. The result? I had more crushed ice than the ice cream and coke combined. It was definitely a cold drink.   Near end, I waved at a server for 5 min. Just to ask for the bill when the restaurant wasn't even busy. At max 6 people excluding me. Then I had to wait 10 min. for my bill to arrive just so I could pay and leave.   Gave them a second chance and was thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"3.5. Food is alright here, no gross stale food. The staff are very friendly and nice, but then again not many people come here. I love their buy 3 get 1 free for tea time. Definitely makes me get more to try out their menu!   I love their salad option because it's potatoes and peaches, and it's my fav combo. Drinks selection is not very diverse but that's alright. I am more concerned about the presence of flies in the summer and autumn seasons. That is just nasty and says some gross things about their kitchen.   I recommend their pork chop bun. It's tasty, $6.50, comes with a drink, and it's very filling. IMO it's the best tea time option. Their fried fish and salad combo is also very great. I love their ka yang toast because the sauce they use is quite different from other thick toasts."}
{"text":"I really loved what I got today. Usually I only like a couple dishes from a place but today, I tried a Hong Kong classic: egg foo yung on rice.   For a price of $9.25, I got this giant omelette with some toppings inside: bean sprouts, cha siu (bbq pork), a tiny bit of green onion, and Chinese mushroom slices. It was lovely and filling. Everything tasted like how it should. Eggs were eggy, and I like that they added mushroom slices because it really elevated the complexity of the taste.   It also comes with a little bowl of sauce that is supposed to go with it, but I tried it and it was better without it.   I totally recommend this dish!   Also, the air ventilation is meh here. Table across us ordered those grilled steaks on teppanyaki plates and the smell permeated the whole dining area. Goodbye, clothes."}
{"text":"Staffs are friendly, place is clean.   Claims they have wifi but we cannot even find the server.  Food looked great but it can use more salt for the chicken & ham spaghetti. The sweet and sour pork rice, the rice was so soft I feel like they made it with too much water.   We got a complimentary soup and the Chinese soup has ????the veggies skin was not peeled...  Prices were reasonable but it would of been nice if it gave with a drink as well."}
{"text":"A pretty standard HK cafe for your HK cafe needs. Been here several times, both for lunch and afternoon tea. It's actually quite popular during the afternoon tea times (2:30-5:30) so there might be a lineup.  The atmosphere is mediocre at best. It was -11 today and the restaurant was extremely breezy. We had to keep our jackets on while we ate. The decor is unintentionally old school: full length mirror on one side, two tvs, paintings of pots, olive painted walls. In terms of food, it's good quality and reasonably priced. The portions are large, and the set meals include a variety of things. Got a mixed noodle today, and the noodle texture was great, with a lot of toppings like wonton, beef ball, BBQ pork, fish ball, and pig feet. One of the main things about their menu is that they feature Macau food (hence ???). The pork bun is a classic, but the bread they used was too crunchy and kinda cuts into the roof of your mouth.  Service is also meh. You can't really expect a lot from this style of a diner, all you gotta do is keep your eyes peeled for the servers so you can flag them down as they rush by.  3 stars for the food!"}
{"text":"Free meal when you order over $30 before tax. That's basically 25% off!!  I'm giving it 4 stars, one to reserve for improving on faster service"}
{"text":"Golden Horse Restaurant aka. Macau Street.  The English name of this restaurant has been in Markham for the longest time!  I had no idea when the ownership was switched, the new owner retained the same English name, but the Cantonese name of this restaurant did change.  This restaurant is another Hong Kong (HK) cafe style which you see a lot in Markham.  However, their items are a bit expensive and do not come with as much perks as the other HK style cafe in the area.  Usually for the meals around $7-$8 in HK style cafe in Markham, you will get a soup and a drink with the meal, but here, you can only choose one or the other.  Price wise, they are definitely not as competitive.  Food wise, I have to admit, they are pretty decent.  I don't come here often due to the price, but when I came here last time for afternoon tea, the tuna sandwich I had was very decent in tasting and portion was big.  I remember trying their dinner here before and they were pretty good as well.  Setting wise, this place is dimmer than the other HK Style cafe.  Overall, this is a decent HK Style Cafe, but with the price they charge, you have a lot more options in Markham."}
{"text":"Before I joined Yelp, I ate here and I vowed to never eat here again. I had a case of food poisoning and I'm pretty sure it is from this place. My boyfriend and I deduced that it was from the beef brisket noodle soup we ordered because it was the only thing we ate together and we both had food poisoning. Without me being aware of it, I was bought here to eat again when I thought I was going to their other location. Aware to not order something similar I had before, I ordered their chicken wings and salad meal during their afternoon tea time specials. I had to pay an extra 1.50 to make my drink a cold honey lemon team, which I don't usually have to pay for at other afternoon tea restaurants. But anyways, my meal just came with 4 small Chicken wings and a potato salad with canned fruits. It was tasty, but the portions were small for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Good service. Fairly priced for lunch. Good portion with soup of the day and choice of coffee or tea. You get a free Chinese newspaper too...If you can read it."}
{"text":"First time going to the restaurant, the restaurant inside is actually bigger than I thought because outside looks small. Food arrived quick, portion is not as much as some other Hong Kong style cafe that I go to. Food taste I will give them 7.5/10. Service is quick and utensils seem clean to me. I will go back some other time and maybe it deserves a higher rating."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for lunch. It was my second time coming here. I remember for my first visit, I got the baked spaghetti (which includes tomato soup) and dear lord I HAD TO drown myself with water. Everything was SOOOO SALTY !! Like damn y'all.   Second time around, got the exact same thing and a lil bit better. The soup was still too salty though. They really do need to chill with the salt. I like my things salty but that was too much for me. The baked spaghetti wasn't too salty which is nice, however they could have been more generous with the cheese. Oh, and the actual pasta? noodle? (however you like to call it) was kind of overcooked. For this meal, it also includes a drink (all for $9.50 which is not too shabby; quite a big plate). You can get tea, lemon tea, ya know the usual. If you're a student, you can get bubble tea. Remember to bring your student ID though. The drink itself was meh. The tapioca was too mushy (stuck to my teeth) and I don't know, for some reason the drink left my teeth feeling so gritty and rough like o_0 !!?? ???   Although, this was a relatively better experience than my first...I have to bring this rating down by 1 star because immediately after I finished my meal, my stomach started to rumble like a mad man. No joke. I think their stuff ain't too clean? sanitary? SoOo Yeah. Oh and I'm like positive one of their staffs dropped a clean fork on the floor and put it back in the clean fork bin (the ones for customers) ..:: .... . . soo um. .?!   Highly doubt I'm gonna come here again."}
{"text":"i personally don't like their waitress because they pushed you to order more than you need and the food  just taste ok in my opinion"}
{"text":"Tried this place a few weeks back, I've always passed by it on Hwy 7 and see so much commercials on TV. So I guess it's finally gotten me to go in and try it. When I first walked in, the lighting was quite dim from the outside, I thought it was closed but I pulled the door and it wasn't. So here we go..Free newspaper in the morning (until all out) with your daily breakfast special.  The breakfast wasn't a wow..its so yummy..its just a typical breakfast that you can find anywhere and everywhere. There were some side fruits on the plate which is considerably ok as I think they were copying Cora's. Price is a little bit expensive for a Chinese place. Almost $6 for a breakfast is consider to be pricey in this day and age. No wonder they need so much advertising on TV.  All in all, this is just an OK place...may not really return due to pricing..."}
{"text":"I order the same thing every time I am at this HK cafe (whether it is the Major Mack location or the Hwy 7 location). Baked pork rice is the way to go!  Everytime I don't order the baked pork rice, I regret not ordering the baked pork rice. The baked pork rice is a plate of fried yellow asian rice topped with boneless pork and covered in a creamy tomato sauce and cheese! Who would not love this combination?  At the moment if you spend more than $30 dollars before taxes, you get a free noodle soup (specified on the menu) or a onion pork chop with rice and vegetables. Often times, my family of 4 order 3 meals enough for $30 and have the onion pork chop with rice as the 4th entree.  Unless you order the specific meal sets or the specials, your meal does not come with soup and hot coffee or tea. However, the portion sizes are very decent and enough for me to take a portion of it home for a snack.  If you are a student at a university, they are currently running a promotion where if you show them your card, they will provide a free bubble tea or hot tea/coffee."}
{"text":"Golden Horse = Pork Chop Rice!  This is my all-time favourite order. Just enough tomato sauce on top of a bed of yellow rice. The portions are large and sometime enough to bring for lunch the next day.  Their potato salad has an HK twist. More fruit and less westernized mayo (think a water down version of miracle whip)  Golden Horse is your classic HK cafe with your choice of hot drink, soup (usually vegetable or whatever asian soup of the day they have), and your entree. Cold drinks will add on an extra $1. Golden Horse has more choices ontop of your normal HK cafe orders. They have started to offer Korean dishes as well as more westernized options (ie. smoked salmon on ceasar salad - the smoked salmon is very salty fyi).  During lunch time and weekend morning breakfast times, it is difficult to get a parking spot as there are not a whole lot of spots outside."}
{"text":"My family visited for breakfast on Good Friday and as I expected, they were busy (we waited 10 minutes). When we got to our just-wiped table, there were still remnants of food on the table and waited another 3 minutes for someone to bring us the menus and tea. We then had to wave down 3 different servers multiple times to take our order. Food took forever to get to our table but we were all very satisfied with our orders. My sister ordered pumpkin congee w/ deep fried fritters and side order of french toast. I got the preserved veggie and pork vermicelli and side order of french toast. We were both very happy. The other two orders were typical egg w/ toast breakfasts but on the side were 3 slices of honeydew and cantaloupe that were touching the egg. The fruit became hot and tasted like egg which was weird. I don't think I'd return again unless I was in the area."}
{"text":"Not many restaurants open late night and I've been coming here since I was a little kid. Their menu has expanded but I'm sure they're still known for their sizzling plates of meat. My bf ordered a bowl of yam noodles which we've never had before and it was really good! Price is decent like HK cafe."}
{"text":"Their signature baked pork chop rice in tomato sauce is really good. The cut of pork chop is dark meat with a line of fat.  Very flavorful and brined so it's tender. Rice is stir fried. Sauce taste like cream of tomato and baked with cheese. All the ingredients work together so well."}
{"text":"A pretty standard HK Style cafe that offers favourites such as the Pork Cutlet Bun and Portuguese Style Chicken on Rice. We usually get the Gui Lin noodles which is pretty good here especially because it comes in a large portion and topped with a lots of minced meat, tomatoes and preserved veggies. The soup base is very rich as well which is great for a cold winter day. Their menu items are pretty pricey I would say, and don't come with drinks unless it is during afternoon tea. The staff are generally nice and not pushy, however parking can be a nightmare."}
{"text":"Been here twice! It's a really small eatery and not a fancy place either. But the food is quite nice! We came here for brunch and ordered the set meals. All the meals come with a soup of the day, tea or coffee, or tea coffee mix.  Our meals:  1. Stir Fried Lai Feng with Guilin Style Sauce $9.50 This is basically a stir fried chewy rice noodle with minced pork, tomatoes, pickled vegetable, and veggies.  This was really tasty and the portion was so huge, I had enough for 2 meals, I couldn't finish it.  2. Pork Chop in German Onion Sauce $9.75 The pork chop itself was quite a large piece. The sauce was a bit salty..but the rice helped balance it out.  3. Spanish Style Baked Garoupa Fish with Spaghetti $10.50 It was ok but a bit on the tart side for the sauce. Again huge portion, my dad couldn't finish it either. Good enough for 2 meals.  Overall, I would come back for the great deals and good meals!  PS: You get a Free Chinese Newpaper too!"}
{"text":"I feel like this place kinda went downhill. The tables are usually not wiped clean and the cups always have a bleached taste/smell. I end up ordering a lemon ice tea just to avoid having to taste/smell that. The food use to be pretty good.. decent HK cafe. Now I find the food questionable. There's usually a jelly like layer over the cream sauces and the meat dishes I've ordered like the black pepper sauce steak has been either really tough or extremely soft like it's been over processed. I just start to really question how the food is prepared.  That being said, I do enjoy the minced meat dishes like spaghetti bologna. I just stick to the tomato dishes and and fries.. haha Or grab a lemon ice tea. :)   The parking here can be a bit hard during the busy times. There's another restaurant and a Service Ontario so there have been times we've had to park in the back. Luckily they have a back space available for an extended parking lot."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good Hk cafe, and this will not make the list.  Older place with unappealing lime green walls and a bit of a foul odour from where we sat.  Ordered the pork and sausage, scrambled eggs and noodle soup for $9 which also included Hk tea.  Generous portions but I found the pork too oily and the bread over buttered.  The other bothersome thing was that I asked if I can have eggs over easy, instead of scrambled.  The waiter said that's fine, but was brought scrambled eggs on the plate.  I reminded him that I ordered over easy, and he took the plate back, but, returned back and said it will cost $1 more.  I declined, and certainly won't be returning back."}
{"text":"service is great but the food is not that spectacular.  it's your typical hong kong style cafe food.  i ordered a ham and cheese sandwich  and the waitress asked me if i wanted the bread toasted or not.  i said no because they charge you a quarter for toasted bread!  like w.t.f.?  the sandwich came on a platter with no garnish.  the cheese was processed.  the wife ordered a pork cutlet bun which was better than my sandwich.  i don't know....there is just something about this place, i won't come back here again.  there are better places for this type of food in scarborough."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times for the last 2 1/2 yrs.  First time writing a review.  I am using 5 star rating.  5 being very good."}
{"text":"Review based solely on the egg omelette (???) priced at $9.75.   This dish came without a beverage or soup, so one could imagine how irked I was to be served this after being charged so much. I saw how gorgeous and moist it looked from another reviewer's picture, but when they brought it out, regret filled my soul immediately.  I tried to give it a chance, because I hated to waste food. I even finished half of it, but it was quite awful. Let me tell you why:   1. Eggs were super dry (lament term would be dry af), it was like they cooked it with 4 parts crusty egg yolk to 1 part egg white kind of texture--felt the need to swallow a pack of Lipitor (high cholesterol meds) afterwards. You would feel very heavy finishing 1/2 of it.  2. The shrimp were wilted and had an unpleasant refrigerator odour.  3. After asking the server why it appeared so different than advertised, instead of acknowledging it was over-cooked, I got some BS explanation from a lady server saying \"Oh, some people like it 'crispy' so, yeah it was cooked like that.\" By 'crispy,' she really meant overcooked  In response to #3--Had I asked for \"crispy\", then yes, make it \"crispy.\" But, I did not make that request, so why would you assume I asked for it to be overcooked? It would had been acceptable to just say \"Oh, sorry. The chef must have overcooked it, it isn't supposed to look like that.\" Not asking for a discount (which none was given by the way), but don't beat around the bush when your chef f*cked up.   If one must be positive, then the soy sauce tasted the best amongst everything that was served.   All that to say, 1 star for not admitting fault and providing an irresponsible answer. Won't be coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 lunch items: a friend rice, a baked rice and a soup noodle.  All of them were bold in flavours.  All had lots of proteins and other ingredients, on top of the carbohydrate ingredients.  They were well portioned, too.  In hindsight, 2 of these items could have fed the 3 of us to stuffed.    The tricky thing is the rating of Golden Horse is subject to whether you like salty and/or oily food.  All the dishes we ordered happened to be salty.  The fried rice was on the oily side.  The baked rice was the least oily entrée among what we had ordered.  Therefore, if you are conscious of sodium and oil intake, you might want to choose the entrée very carefully.  In terms of services, the business was understaffed this afternoon.  They were slow in assigning numbers to the people lining up for tables at the door.  I was not sure there was even a greeter, as I had to wave a server down to assign us a wait number.  After seated, it was almost a game to get a server's attention.  They were not avoiding us to be clear; they were busy running around serving and cleaning up tables.  Once we could get their attention, the services was effective, efficient and polite.  I happen to like salty food, so the food tasted good to me.  Yet, I dislike oily food.  Together with the slow services, I consider Golden Horse a 3-starred Hong Kong cafe.  If you enjoy salty and oilier food, you will likely have higher opinion of them."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since we have been here. The food was still good and same with the service. We both got baked rice dishes from their lunch menu. It is great, lunches ranged from $10- $13 and comes with a soup and hot beverages. Portions were big and we both had leftovers."}
{"text":"Pretty much your average HK cafe which offers tons of great options on their menu. Large portions, affordable prices. The portions were so huge that when we wanted to order a dish for each of us at the table (5 people) the waitress kept warning us that it will be too much food -- and she was right.  What makes this place stands out is its free meal when you order $30+ of food. You get to choose between either a Pork Chop on rice or a Guilin Noodle. I recommend the Pork Chop on rice, because similar to their other dishes, this one is massive in size as well, super filling for one person to consume. The meat was really tender and the gravy sauce tasted good.  We ordered a bunch of other stuff: Chicken breast with Masala Mushroom Sauce on pasta, Crispy noodle with Beef in Black Bean Sauce, Hainan Chicken Rice, Lao You Noodles. They all tasted decent, basically what you can expect from a HK style cafe, but nothing really stood out either except for the portions.   Would I come back again? Probably not. There are way too many better HK style cafes out there."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall rating. Golden horse restaurant is not one my \"go-to\" Hong Kong style cafe as I only like a few of their menu items and I do find some of their dishes are priced high. But for the items that are good, they are cooked pretty well.   I would recommend the following items 1)afternoon menu - crispy pork cutlet on bun 2)afternoon menu - beef and lamb brisket plus trotter with rice noodles in soup 3) their baked rice and spaghetti   We visited during dinner yesterday as I was craving a good baked pork chop dish. And it did not disappoint. I couldn't finish the dish as it was pretty heavy on the cheese. If you are a cheese lover, you will like the dish.   Service was good and price was reasonable. The house special baked pork chop dish was priced at 9something pre tax.  My boyfriend had one of the item from the dinner combo menu, it was around $11ish with soup and drink"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and we are known that they have the best hk style boneless pork with egg over rice.  We order that dish and beef brisket noodle soup.  It does not disappoint us.  The pork is boneless and full of flavour.  The beef brisket is soft and tender.  The price might be higher compare to other HK style restaurant, but we think it's worth while and we been keep going there many times."}
{"text":"This is an average Chinese cafe.   The place was very lit with modern furniture. We went there on a Saturday dinner and the restaurant was pretty busy but got seated quickly (party of 6).   We ordered the Ox Tongue with curry sauce ($10.99). This order wasn't a meal. No drink and no soup.  :(   Ox Tongue with curry sauce- Ox tongue were very bland. I think a pinch of salt & pepper will really help elevate the Ox tongue flavour. The ONLY saving grace was the curry sauce. It wasn't the best tasting curry- it was passable.   I think the most disappointing thing about the dish was the amount of Ox tongue we received. There were ONLY 4 tiny thin pieces!! I don't like leaving a restaurant and still feel HANGRY!!!!   There are way BETTER Ox tongue dishes elsewhere with bigger portion sizes and better flavour !   Final verdict: The amount of food you get doesn't justify the price you pay. I'll probably give this place another try but I don't have high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for lunch. The place was vey busy but we were lucky enough to get a seat right away.   Pork Cutlet bun $6.50 - the pork was very lean, juicy and tender.   Pork cutlet on rice $9.75 once again the pork was as the pork bun described above. Portions were very filling.   Spaghetti bolognese $9.50 -  Not very saucy in terms of tomato sauce. It was more like spaghetti with ground beef and cheese. My mom didn't like it much but I thought it was pretty good.    Fried sticy rice $11.25 - no complaints here. Its a simple dish and it tasted good.  All meals came with soup and milk tea except for the pork cutlet bun.   Service was really fast. Everything tasted good and the pork was amazing.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Came here to kill some time as my car was being serviced across the street. So I had to do a solo mission :(  Inside is surprisingly spacious and lighting is really dim for some reason like they trying to save on the electricity bill. Its no romantic fancy restaurant or anything, just simply a HK style cafe.   Ordered the spaghetti and meat sauce with an iced milk tea for $11 which comes with a side soup. Tasted good and drink was refreshing. Service was also very efficient."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. Two exceptionally bad servers: a lady in dyed brown hair, and an older gentleman in spikey black hair with glasses. They completely ignored my table... They could see people behind us, in front of us, to the left and right, yet just not us. This happened many times from the moment we walked in until the moment we walked out. The younger gentleman was okay. Interestly, the lady started acting nicer when it was time for the bill. Overall, the service was brisk and impersonal.   Now, let's talk food: I recommend the beef tongue lunch. Portions were good, too. Personally, I didn't like the sauce on the dish and the broccoli was very tough. But, the meal was served with soup and a beverage, so I'd say the value of the meal was quite good. My favourite part of the meal was definitely the Hong Kong milk tea; smooth, strong flavours.   Taste and value are important for me, so I'd come back again for a quick meal if I were in the area."}
{"text":"One of the better HK style cafes! Its not as fancy as Phoenix, but I much prefer here. Service is the same as you would expect at any Chinese cafe, you just have to be less sensitive; they are friendly overall. Funny if you get their sense of humour.  Anyway, they are fast, delicious, and always open! Theres a reason they have been opened for so long and always packed!  Milk tea is a must.   Food is pretty common, no wow factor but it fills you up."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my dad on a Monday night and it wasn't too busy. The menu is extensive but a lot more expensive than regular Hong Kong style cafes. They also had quite a few servers but the kitchen was pretty slow. We waited about 15 mins for my dads baked pork chop on rice with tomato sauce and then I had to wait about another 15 mins to get my baked \"garoupa\". My dad was already done eating at that point but he said it was just alright. While the fish on my rice was a good size, it was just one of those frozen tilapia fillets you can get at any grocery store (they prob got it at the freshco next door when it was on sale) so I could taste the fishy-ness even under all the cream sauce. I did like the sauce with the rice and the portion was big but at $10.99 I expected more. I probably won't be back cuz I can better tasting baked rice dishes that are cheaper if I just drove down to hwy 7."}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service  Golden Horse opened a second branch in the Major Mac/Leslie plaza, in the previous location of Kenny's Noodle (which for the record is down to one branch only).  The setup and layout is quite similar to Kenny's Noodle, although they did modernize it a bit. It wasn't too busy on a Sunday at around 8:30pm, and we were treated immediately as a result.  First thing I noticed when I opened the menu: Holy crap the prices are very high! I've been to the Highway 7 branch, and I'm quite sure the Highway 7 branch has lower prices compared to here. I'll definitely visit there again just to make sure, but for HK style cafe standards this place is definitely on the high end in terms of prices.  I ordered the clam and fresh tomato spaghetti. It was around $9 and unfortunately did not come with a drink, so I had to order a separate drink. The food and drink both came out quite fast, and I have to admit that their portions are quite big. However, I didn't find my dish memorable at all. There honestly wasn't a lot of sauce or clams, and most of the dish was a large plate of spaghetti. Whatever sauce and clams were there tasted decent, though.  Service was excellent the entire way. However, with so many HK style cafes in Richmond Hill/Markham, I don't see myself returning unless I'm in the area and want a quick food fix.  I honestly think I'm being generous with this review, but to be fair the food wasn't \"bad\". Just not worth the prices you pay."}
{"text":"Taking away the +.5 for service after last night. Despite the restaurant being only 50% full (it was 10pm after all), we were ignored for the first 10 minutes despite the fact we were ready for our order.  I ordered spaghetti with bacon and cream sauce. However, I noticed there was a lack of parsley, so I wanted a little more, except the waitress said it costs extra to put more parsley. Okay...haven't heard that before. The spaghetti and bacon were average, but the cream sauce was way too creamy, to the point I couldn't finish since the sauce made me so stuffed.  This is the only HK style café in the area open past 10pm, which means if I'm in the area looking for a late snack I don't have much of a choice. However in no way would I go out of my way to come here (plus, merging back to Hwy 7 can be a nightmare)."}
{"text":"This has become my fam's go to weekend lunch place. Honestly, I wouldn't say it is anything stellar but the portions are generous and is a good way to satisfy your hk food cravings. They also do a buy 4 get 1 free for their lunch combos which at most are $12 which isn't too bad. Lunch specials come with a soup and drink. Another tip is that if you have a student ID, then you can upgrade your drink to milk tea with tapioca or a cold drink! :)  Service is also quite good and food comes quickly. Overall, no complaints thus far."}
{"text":"Cheap and good food! From HK style baked rice/spaghetti set meals to ala carte and snacks, it got a huge selection of menu. Fast and good service.   My son and I shared the baked fried chicken fillet with Portuguese sauce on rice, makes you realized how hungry you are the moment it was served. Be warned super hot Portuguese sauce  on top of chicken n rice. Serving is big. Price $10.50. Enjoyed this dish up to the last grain of rice. On the side, we had spicy salt tofu which were done very crispy, $6.25. They also have Guilin style beef brisket noodle soup, the beef were very soft and tender."}
{"text":"I come here for their afternoon tea special. The dish I like the most at this restaurant is their pork chop bun. They breaded their pork instead of just frying the pork naked which really makes its that much more delicious. Whenever I come here with my family, we have to order this dish because it's that good! On the other hand, the service here isn't the best which discourages us from going out of our way just for the sandwich."}
{"text":"Came to try this new place out for dinner on Sunday. This location was nowhere as busy as the Markham location.  The menu is quite extensive but I noticed that the prices are a lot more expensive than the Markham location.. and most of the menu items for dinner are combos.. (i.e. no drink, no soup, etc).. For that price, I would expect the dish to come with a beverage or something at the very least.  We ordered stewed ox tail with rice ($15) and pumpkin congee ($5.50).. the congee was a decent sized bowl, but the rice dish was only enough for one person..quite pricey for a HK style cafe."}
{"text":"Golden Horse is a typical HK style cafe with plenty of lunch/dinner options that include a drink, entree and a soup. It can get quite loud in here with all the hustle and bustle of the staff trying to serve all the tables.  The price of the food is slightly higher than other HK style cafes in the area, but the presentation and taste of the food is definitely better.  The parking in this plaza is very limited and can be hard to get a spot during weekend lunch times. The wait for tables is quite long as well with barely any standing space in the doorway as they try to maximize the seating area.  I believe they are opening a new location at Major Mackenzie & Leslie (drove by)..hopefully there will be shorter wait times there!"}
{"text":"Fast Hong Kong style restaurant , not expensive and service is ok. I like Guilin noodles"}
{"text":"above average price. I waited a long time for them to serve the food. Not recommended."}
{"text":"2.5 stars rounding up to a 3  I've been to this HK style diner on more then a few occasions over the past years.  This place closes at 11, so it's ideal for late dinner.  Smoked Salmon with Spaghetti Noodles of Mushroom Sauce -this item sounds delicious on the menu but I knew it wouldn't pair up good, because the smoked salmon is cold and the noodles with creams sauce would be hot.. cold protein with warm starch just doesn't work.. turns out my prediction was right.. my brother said it was just so-so and would never re-order.  My friend went with a Sirlion Steak on a Hot Sizzling Plate..  And I went with a assorted meat on a Hot Sizzling Plate.. which included the sirloin.  Sirloin to me almost always takes bad.. it's just not the same flavour of a strip lion, ribeye, tender lion.. it's missing a lot of flavour because it does have there same marble fat properties of the prime cut I mentioned above..   The chicken steak was good.. dark meat.. juicy and deep fried work was good..  The Pork Chop steak was also good, as I expected.. my favourite dish here and also what I believe to. E heir signature dish is their Baked Pork Chop Rice with Tomato Sauce.  Also came with a slice of Ham.. it was also deep fried?? Would have preferred it just warmed up on a pan.."}
{"text":"My wife wanted Hong Kong style breakfast so we decided to come here. Weekday morning and it was easy to find a seat (don't know how it is on weekends). I was happy to see some other options on the menu than just Hong Kong breakfasts. I had eggs with bacon and hash brown. My wife had the bowl of pork noodles. The portions were ok size. The hash brown was a bit too crispy, but the rest was okay. The price was reasonable. Will have to return to try lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I love HK cafes. When I go to a new HK cafe, I normally get the baked spaghetti bolognese, 1) because it's my favorite and 2) because it's a great measuring stick of a place since everyone has their take on it. Unfortunately the offering that Golden Horse provided was a little lack luster. It wasn't baked which I knew going in from the menu. Without being baked though, it really lacked the uniqueness that comes with an HK-style spaghetti. The sauce tasted like it was store bought and out of a jar. The pasta was also whatever. Since the noodles weren't cooked in with the sauce, it had trouble incorporating the flavour into it. There are many other options on the menu though, so I'd come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Went with my friend after skating near by. We ordered bolgonese spagetti and french toast.    Bolgonese spagetti 9.25. Only okay as per my dining companion. 2.5/5. He said \"nothing special\". The french toast 5.25 was the same. I thought the price was high for the french toast. The decor was nice. The place was cleaner than some hong kong style resturants and the servers were attentive.   Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Newly renovated to replace the old Kenny's and it's a good difference.   Good service actually exists for this type of Chinese cafe style establishment.  Morning breakfasts are simple and well priced.  I would come back for casual weekend mornings anytime."}
{"text":"Average HK style cafe.  It's tucked into a little plaza right next to ServiceCanada.  Came in on a Thursday night with a party of 3 and it was fairly empty.   They have this deal where if you buy $30 you get a pork-chop rice for free.   1. Oxtail in Red Wine with Rice - The sauce was generous and very creamy; the oxtail was not cooked for not long enough and was very chewy ): 2. Hainese Chicken with Rice - This was actually not bad; the hainese \"flavour\" you usually get from the chicken but it was very passable.   3. French Toast - YUM. The French Toast was thick and huuuuugeeee.  It was warm and doughy - The perfect way to destroy your carbs for the day. 4. Pork Chop Rice - Ehhhhh... 2 huge pieces of pork with rice. For it being free it was pretty good. It came with gravy and filled me pretty well.  This won't be my A option - I still feel New City Restaurant is my place."}
{"text":"This place used to be good but not sure if theyve started making a bit of profit but the service has gotten really bad.  The waitresses here reply us with such a bitchy tone. Food is expensive and their portions have gotten a lot smaller.   If I could, I wouldnt even give them tips. Why should I pay $7 for a small ass breakfast and have waitresses walking around with a bitchy and arrogant look and be expected to give them tips? This place is fucking shit now."}
{"text":"Golden Horse has been in this neighbourhood for a long time, serving HK style cafe food with meal deals that serve a soup and hot drink like many other restaurants of the same style.  I ordered the sweet and sour pork on rice, as part of their Value Meal options ($7.99+tax and tip); it comes with a soup (depends on what they have, but vegetable soup is a staple), but no drink. The dish could've used a bit more seasoning as the sauce was light on flavour. The rice, to my surprise, was cooked with too much water and was mushy. It wasn't congee-like in consistency but soft enough that chewing was not needed. The pork was a bit dry, and did not have a crispy exterior so that was disappointing as well. For just under $10, it is fair value and you are left full, but I've definitely had better. I've heard their Hainanese Chicken is really good, so I'll be back to try it."}
{"text":"Delicious food, average customer service, prices are a little expensive, but for the quality of the food it's worth it."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better HK cafes I've been to in terms of taste, but also one of the pricier ones. Most of their dishes do not include a drink with its pricing like other places and it's also $1.50 extra to make it a cold drink (expensive for just a few ice cubes- other places are usually $1.00).   When I come here I usually order the house special baked pork chop with spaghetti. It's the best place to have it."}
{"text":"2.5 Star  Came here during Soft Opening and the experience was a little disappointing.  I have been to the Golden Horse Restaurant location in Markham numerous of time and though it was not the best but at least a consistent 3 star experience.   I have to admit I was a little excited when this location opened up as the interior is more spacious and not as dark as their first location. But I guess there is a price to pay for that? Everything is more pricey than the original location and one of the most expensive HK style cafe in the area.  Their set dinner starting at $13 or so. And it is a fried rice with soup and drink. A bowl of Beef Brisket Noodle without drink is $7.75. And if you want one of those Sizzling Hot Plate Dinner is $20.99 and up.  I don't mind paying if the food is amazing but what we ordered were quite standard.  Cordon Bleu Pork Chop ($13.25)  and Buddy Minced Pork Noodle ($8.25) both as a la carte were so so. For the Cordon Bleu, some better sides should be offered instead of just plain boiled unseasoned broccoli and spaghetti/rice.   Service was lacking as the servers were busy eating their own dinner. I have to wave them down furiously to place my order, ask for sharing bowls/plates and even to pay for the bill.  Maybe my conception of Hong Kong Style Cafe as restaurant where one can get good food at affordable price is no longer valid? I doubt I would be back again as there are so many restaurants in the area that has much better food at more competitive price."}
{"text":"Golden Horse Restaurant has a really suggestive Chinese Name \"Macau Street\"... but I found the items on the menu are more in line with Hong Kong style cafe with the usual Sizzling Hot Plate dinner set, Baked rice/spaghetti, Curry Rice, Congee, Noodle...Nothing really jump out as unique..   House Special Baked Pork Chop ($7.50)  - My boyfriend does not like cheese..so we request this without cheese  - Rice is fried rice based  - Pork Chop is quite tender and really lean and boneless  - Tomato sauce is quite light, but I rather have it with cheese, the way it suppose to be!!   Yam Noodles with Beef Brisket ($7.50)  - The soup based is really rich... really meaty and flavoured...  - a touch of sourness and spiciness.. but not overwhelming...  - Beef brisket is really tender... melt in your mouth softness...  - the yam noodles are really light.. with a transparency and a little chewy... interesting..   Hong Kong Style Milk Tea ($1.75)  - A-OK! Quite milky which gave it a silky touch!   Pork Chop on Bun Macau Style ($4.50) - Sizable... and filling!! - Pork Chop is breaded and deep fried... a little on the dry side since it was cut really thin - I do love the bun, it is like crispy toasted on the outside and soft inside..   The menu selections of Golden Horse Restaurant is really extensive.. You will definitely find something that you will like to eat. They also has Lunch Specials/Afternoon Tea Specials which includes a free drink."}
{"text":"Came here with my brother today so it was busy because it's a holiday. Shortly after my brother and I came in and waited to be seated, a group of 4 people came in and they got seated first, with the staff promising we'd get seated immediately after them. Then a group of 7 people came in and they moved the group of 4 people to the seats that were supposed to be for my brother and I, and seated the 7 people. My brother and I weren't seated after waiting 20 minutes so we left. Very disappointed in the customer service as they seated two groups of people before us after waiting for a long time for a seat."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Pretty standard HK cafe . Nothing fancy or special.  I was sitting near the entrance so pretty cold ever time people go in and out. :( The plates do not look very clean."}
{"text":"How do I not give them 1 star? Smells like a butt hole...with poo hanging out of it...not willing to let go...good isn't exceptional. A lot of waitresses, but they half ass everythimg you ask for. I don't want to say anymore. Just don't come here....."}
{"text":"Despite the chinese name \"Macao Street\", there hardly if any Portuguese food in their menu. The menu is very much the typical HK style cafe restaurant. With an OK selection, but it's a bit confusing. They serve steak but also stuff you find from a chinese fast food. Prices are about 10% higher than the competing HK-style restaurants in the same area.  The decor of the restaurant is quite nice, but the atmosphere is ruined by some bad restaurant practice. Waiters deposit dirty dishes in a trolley placed right in the middle of dinning area. It's really annoying to hear loud clanging sound when you're dining and trying to have a conversation. The actual dish washing room (or whatever it's called) is right behind the bar area.   The problem with this restaurant was the food.  We ordered macao style baked chicken and rice, Baked Pork Chop on rice (listed on the menu as a \"house special\"). Presentation on the dish was very nice. The meat in both dish lacked a bit of flavour, and portions was slightly smaller than what you can find everywhere else. But the real issue was the MSG. Both me and my friend were thirsty when we got home.  People go to restaurants for great food, even if a restaurant has terrible decor or in dire need of renovation. But this is a clear case of \"all flash and no substance.\""}
{"text":"Overall an okay place. Perhaps it was a busy night and there weren't even servers to go around because it took a while to get any server's attention. Large menu selection so it takes a while to go through it all along with the specials posted everywhere.   The fried pork chop with rice or spaghetti and gravy was too salty for my tastes. It was on special for less than half price (if my memory serves me correctly it was $6.99 vs $14.50)."}
{"text":"First time I ate here was when I had just moved back to Toronto from Alberta and craved good Chinese food. I was not disappointed.  Last night my family and I ate here again. We sat at the table immediately in front of the host stand. The problem with that was whenever the servers who close the drawers it felt like it was slamming into my back.   The servers at this location seem to be more attentive than the Richmond Hill location, but just as busy. Since we sat at a table that was too long to service all at once only half the table got more tea or was cleared."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant several times now and I think this is one of those places that I'll only go to as a last resort. One of the best things about HK style cafes are their combos with soup and a drink. This restaurant doesn't provide a lot of options for combos, which is disappointing. Their prices for non-combos are already on the higher side so I'd rather not have to pay extra to make it a meal. The food itself is good, but I don't believe it's good enough to justify the price. If you are getting a combo make sure to check whether they charge you extra money if you can't finish and wish to take the leftovers in their take out containers (I think they don't charge you if you have your own container). Overall recommendation - worth giving a try but it's not worth the value you pay."}
