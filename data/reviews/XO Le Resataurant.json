{"text":"Wow!  What a great place to celebrate my birthday!  Definitely one of the best meals we have had in Montréal. Even better than Toqué. As good as, maybe better than La Chronique. We had the menu dégustation with wine pairings and enjoyed every dish and wine. Some highlights:  kampachi sashimi, scallop and veal cheek, shrimp and yellow beet risotto, salmon confit. Excellent service  knowledgeable and pleasant staff.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 Service: 4.5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Price: $$$-$$$$  This year was our first year celebrating MTL à Table! Though hubby and I had taken part in similar events in Toronto and New York, but as we were new to the event scene in Montreal (I know, we're late in the game!), we didn't really know what to fully expect.  There were 3 choices for each course, and XO also gave us amuse bouche and petit fours, kind of making it to 5 courses instead of the standard 3.  This is what we ordered: Me: Squash and Apple Soup / Confit Salmon / Lemon Tart Verrine Hubby: Antipasti / White Truffle Tagliatelles / Éclair  We thought that it was pretty surprising that the Confit Salmon was available for an extra cost over the White Truffle Tagliatelles as white truffle is quite expensive. I gotta say, we had to sort of fight over the white truffle dish as we both love the ingredient very much! (We didn't want to order the same thing).  Our amuse bouche was very unique; it was veal tongue with almonds, dried fruit, ricotta cheese? and other ingredients. I hadn't tried a lot of tongue dishes before so I was a little skeptical, while my husband was looking forward to it as he likes tongue. Anyway, overall the textures and flavours were well balanced and it was similar to eating cold foie gras. Both hubby and I liked it and would reorder if it was possible!  My first appetizer was very delicious. I had initially craved squash soup for awhile so it was a great coincidence when I saw it on the menu at XO! It was served with a Cheese Steak Baguette which was amazing. The sweetness of the apple complemented the squash very well, and the savoury flavours of the cheese steak balanced everything well. Hubby's appetizer was very well presented and again delicious. With tuna, figs, coppa and almond mushrooms, it was definitely a dish that hubby enjoyed very much.  My main course was good but a little disappointing. Having paid the extra few dollars, it didn't exceed my expectations nor did it have a WOW factor. The visual presentation was very pretty, and when my dish was came out, the waiter poured the warm broth over for fresh flavours. The broth was slightly Asian (I think), and it felt very familiar. The salmon was cooked well but a little too overcooked for my taste, but I did like the mussels and the mango topping for its fresh tastes. On the other hand, my husband's tagliatelles dish was so good! I wished I had ordered it too... anyway, the white truffle was in the sauce of the pasta, and it was so rich in flavour. It was one of our first times having white truffle over the black, and they were distinctly different. There were many different textures as well, such as the cauliflower and bacon which overall enhanced the pasta. Sigh, maybe I will go back before MTL à Table ends just for this pasta! (I must be Italian at heart)  My dessert was very delicious and I was able to end my dinner on a strong note! The citrus tastes of the lemon wasn't overpowering which I very much appreciated, and I think it was because of the yuzu that was used as well. The edible flowers was very pretty and the housemade marshmallow and rosemary used balanced the citrus flavours out. This dessert kind of reminded me of one that I enjoyed at Laloux, maybe that's what I like it so much. My husband's éclair was delicious as well. It didn't have your average chocolate filling but carrot cream! It definitely didn't taste like any carrot, and it tasted more like a sweet fruit. The dessert was definitely one of the best éclairs we ever had so far and it was a refreshing change from the more standard chocolate cream filling.  Our last little note of dessert was a chocolate truffle which was really good! Who am I kidding...I'm a sucker for all things sweet. What I liked about this truffle was that it wasn't bitter nor too sweet - it was a perfect balance of flavours while it was dense and rich all at the same time.  Overall, all courses filled us up while it didn't leave us bloated or too full. The quality of food that was presented was overall very high quality and it was a very pleasurable and enjoyable experience. All the servers were very intelligent and friendly, and they also made sure that whatever we needed was available. Compared to the full tasting menu we experienced before, of course there was a difference, but for the price of $41, the 3 dinner course was quite worth it. We were surprised to find that XO isn't a popular place for MTL à Table, but we were able to have a enjoyable dinner that wasn't rushed or hurried by anything or anyone. We would highly recommend XO Le Restaurant for MTL à Table or for a regular dinner separate from the event. I definitely recommend their tasting menu as it's fabulous and one of the best in Montreal. We had a full 3 hour dinner complete with more than 8 courses!"}
{"text":"The food here was good. The ambiance was fantastic. We only got chicken fingers, poutine, and club sandwich for room service so we could not speak on the other food. The drinks were very good but a little pricey. Great place for a date or group! Great service too."}
{"text":"Our trip to Montreal and Le Saint James Hotel was nothing short of perfect.  High praise indeed, coming from a very discriminating guest.  Breakfast at XO was nothing short of happiness.  Our trip to Montreal was one to explore the food and culture.  The chef and team truly understand what it is to prepare food properly.  Silver table settings, hot plates, eggs cooked to perfection, braising the ham in broth and toasted coconut on the banana pancakes.  Each evening Nick would proclaim at dinner \"I can't have desert, I have to leave room for breakfast\".  As a New Yorker and culinary enthusiast, I was truly pleased and have to admit, breakfast was a highlight of my trip.  Not only do we adore Montreal, but we truly appreciate the attention to detail and professionalism of the staff.  We will absolutely be returning and truly thank Le Saint James for being a contributor to our amazing weekend."}
{"text":"Incredible brunch, served from 7am-1pm on weekends. We had the assiette st-james and the fruit, granola and yogurt cup which were both fantastic. Brunch comes with complementary smoothie shooters that I wish were bigger, they were so good! The coffee was some of the best I've ever had. It comes in a tea kettle for the table with an assortment of condiments to add. It's a fancy restaurant with a casual, friendly feel."}
{"text":"We tried Xo for lunch and everything, from the food, to the ambience and the service, were spectacular. The special of the day lunch menu for $25 had an amazing selection of gourmet appetizers and main courses. We loved the tagliatelle with rabbit ragout, the salmon with cabbage and sausage and the creamy cauliflower soup. Amazing tastes! Even the presentation of the coffee was sophisticated. The ambience of the restaurant is magnificent, with a mix of luxurious modern and old-fashion column decor. Great place!"}
{"text":"Very original presentation for all the dishes. Food was good. Service was remarkable! It's always nice to have the sommelier explain the wine pairings. Highly recommended for a lovely night out."}
{"text":"This restaurant was located in the hotel I was staying at. I had already eaten dinner but thought about having an after dinner drink. The atmosphere is absolutely incredible,huge crystal chandeliers, massive sofas, beautiful lighting. The ceilings are at least 30 feet high. The details around all the walls really are beautiful. Its as if your in a french palace. Nice place to drink and kick back.   The service was very good, but it should be for the cost of a drink. My vodka with soda water was $20.00. I didn't mind since the atmosphere was so nice."}
{"text":"I am not so high on this place. The night we ate here it was really empty. There might have been one other table and we sat down around 7:30p.  The interior looks like a small old palace. Maybe it's an old bank.  Super ornate but the walls were painted in a shinny gray color.  It's kind of strange.  Wasn't my style. Too trendy.  The food was along the same lines. Trendy and just ok."}
{"text":"Je mets 3 étoiles car le restaurant est magifique ! Le decor interieur est super beau, je pense qu'avant c'était une ancienne banque. Mais pour la nourriture .. ce n'étais pas pour moi .. surtout la courgette avec le riz sauvage. L'entrée crevette géante à 26$ c'est vraiment 1 seule crevette ! Les cocktails sont assez bon mais c'est autour de 16$-17$ donc disons que préparez vous à dépenser 100$/personne (entrée+boisson+plat principal+dessert). Leur pain et beurre .. c'est une déception. Pour le temps d'attente avant d'être servit, c'est 30 minutes à peu près. Le service est courtois."}
{"text":"I was at XO Le to celebrate Christmas/anniversary with girlfriend.   I had high hopes with the prefix menu but I was severely disappointed.   The bread served was cold and hard.  Here's a tip, two minutes in an oven at 350 will bring stale rolls back to life.   Your kitchen needs to work on decoration and meal prep. Dishes were poor. The food was cold. Meat venison meatballs were dry. Venison is a a lean meat therefore it needs more fat.   The cranberry splatter looked like a murder scene. The smear of chocolate on the Christmas log was not appetizing. It looked like something that came out of my dog.  The turkey breast was under seasoned and dry.  The duck confit came out cold. I understand it is a prefix menu and items are prepped beforehand however, don't leave food standing so it becomes cold. There should be a limit to how much prep work you do before serving. It tasted as it it was fully assembled and sitting under a heating light prior to being served.   The meal ended with a fern decorated with chocolate. I'm not sure who thought of this, but it is quite juvenile. Please put some more thought in your menu or give your employees a break and take off for the holiday.   $95 dollars for a prefix menu was a total rip off. Could of went to Chinatown and had a meal for a fraction of the cost but twice as appetizing.  Management needs to put more thought in the design an execution of your holiday menu. Overall this was the worst meal I had during my weekend in Montreal."}
{"text":"Lunch at XO Le was serene and delightful.  Superb service and food."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of having my engagement party here. It was a small, intimate, family-only affair, and it was absolutely beautiful.  The restaurant is one of the most gorgeous spaces I have ever seen. Beautiful chandeliers, breathtaking ceiling trims, stunning chandeliers, and grand balconies. One of my criterias when picking a restaurant for my engagement dinner was that it had to be pretty. And being in XO is like being in a sexy, ornate, royal palace.   We had the tasting menu, and everything was good. To be honest, I did not critique the food as much as I usually do when I eat out, but months later my fiance's cousin still talks about the lamb we had at XO. So yes, I guess the food was excellent. :)  The service was immaculate from start to end. As soon as we entered through the doors, they took our coats, the cake, any extra bags and stored them away, and we were then led upstairs up the grand staircase to the top level. Our server (can't believe I cant remember his name) was charming, attentive and beyond helpful. He explained everything with a smile on his face, stayed out of the way throughout most of the dinner, but then magically appeared beside you whenever you wanted him. He got us sparklers for our cake, and when the first two pairs fizzled out before we were done taking our pictures, he produced another pair from his pocket with a \"I got extras, just in case\". It's the little things. He was so well-trained, professional, and pleasant to deal with.. One of the best servers we have ever had in Montreal.   In the end, we wrapped up our celebratory dinner, shared some cake with our server too and took the rest to go. We left very very happy with the evening - everything had gone perfectly, thanks to the expert staff at XO. We were treated like guests in a beautiful royal palace. It was an amazing experience, and XO has garnered a special place in my heart.   Just as we were stepping out the door, our host said \"Goodnight. Hope to see you for the wedding.\" ..He just might ;-)"}
{"text":"The eighties called and they want their pretentious food back. They charged me $12 dollars for one white and green asparagus spear covered a some sauce and edible flowers that were bitter and did not complement at all. Sigh, it was also served on a mirror.   I should have known the place was not good. Completely empty from the time we started our meal until we left around 9pm."}
{"text":"I absolutely love XO!  The service is always terrific, the food excellent and the ambience is out of this world.  Great for client meetings as well."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 10. Final tally ended up being eight.  We've been here for 2 hours. None of us have our meals yet.  Go elsewhere. It's not worth it. The place is barely a quarter full. There's no excuse for this in a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely stunning, the room resembles a modern Palace de Versailles with its grand balconies and decadent chandeliers. Was in the area and came for a few drinks on a Saturday night. Service was stellar and our server seemed to be very knowledgeable being able to parlay quite a bit of information about different types of cognac (our drink of choice for the night). Although the restaurant was nearly empty, there were a few tables of formally dressed patrons. I think I even saw men dressed in tuxedos. Will have to come back to try the food."}
{"text":"If Michelin cared about Montreal, Xo would easily earn 1 Michelin star.  Chef Michelle Mercuri has designed a menu that tantalizes that palate and makes you want more... until the next course comes and continues the experience.  I went with the 6 course tasting menu, which really was a bit more than that:  - No amuse bouche, surprisingly - Snow crab salad with coriander foam, white wine gelee, and dill and olive powder - Sea Bass with Dried Fish Eggs - Rum emulsion, butternut squash and butternut squash chips, and molasses - Trio of Veal (braised cheek, sweetbreads, and loin) with house-made pappardelle, trumpet mushrooms, and sliced black truffle - Filet of bison (cooked sous vide) with cocoa beans, dried cauliflower, and cauliflower puree - Cheese course (the cart could have offered more than the 7 cheeses they had, but the 3 I had were great) - Pre-Dessert: White chocolate and coconut ball with milk inside.  Apparently they freeze the milk with liquid nitrogen, then roll that solid up in white chocolate and coconut.  Put it back in the fridge and serve it up after the milk melts! - Beer ice cream, Brownie, and chocolate ganache - Mignardises: Chocolate crumble, passion fruit macaroon, peanut butter, chocolate truffle, passion fruit jelly  All in all, a wonderful meal and wonderful wine pairings.  I especially liked that they give you a separate wine pairing for each cheese chosen from the cart... this is a great touch and one I have never encountered before."}
{"text":"Nice location and setting, but ultimately not quite worth the money. We got the tasting menu which was 6 courses and included a soup, salad, starters, main, and dessert.  While there was nothing to complain about the courses, there wasn't anything special either. The order of the items was a bit odd as a beet salad came out after the main and before the dessert.   The service on this night was particularly slow and took about 2.5 hours for the 6 courses. Typically, it should be an hour less than that. The staff kindly discounted our aperitifs proactively which was why they got an extra star."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé pour la St-Valentin, le service et la nourriture étaient parfaits. Nous y retournerons"}
{"text":"It is very, very hard to pull off molecular gastronomy without coming across as a poseur or an amateur. Unfortunately, XO tries hard but does not achieve the gold.  At its core, molecular gastronomy is offering the guest an experience, versus food. The truth is that XO lacks the resources to make this happen. They are using a finite group of people to try to do what New York City or L.A. restaurants do with three times the staff.  The result is that there are problems.  For example, my salmon was a good piece of salmon. Like most other restaurants today, the salmon was dumped into a sous vide cooker, and was done perfectly. While most restaurants would have crisped the outside in a skillet in order to accomplish a nice golden crust on the fish, the molecular genius decided that this was not necessary. Instead of a crisp fish crust, they would serve perfectly crispy side vegetables to take the place of the crust.  Brilliant!  Except the desired crispness never materialized.    Instead, I got fish jello.  The staff wants to do well. Really.  And they are absolutely attentive.  But this kind of dish cannot be accomplished without doubling the kitchen staff.  Similar stories could be told about every course, for every diner.  My suggestion for the person in charge of creative control is this: it is better to do very little, perfectly, than to be ambitious, but fall short of gold.  For 450 Canadian you might do better elsewhere. A perfect steak frites might be a better formula than a fish that someone meditated upon and served with tea steam."}
{"text":"Truly fine dining. Delicious tasting menu, impressive wine list, friendly and unpretentious staff, comfortable seating, and beautiful ambiance. The food and the staff made celebrating our anniversary a very special occasion. Even the music was nice! Couldn't ask for anything better!"}
{"text":"By far this was my worst dinner experience in Montreal.  I should of walked away when they offered a tasting menu. I regret not listening to myself.   When we sat down, we were greeted with stale bread. Cold and dense. I knew the meal was going to be downhill from there.   The next taste was a tiny Brussels sprout with a touch of cream. Bland and tasteless.   We were then offered four over priced venison meatballs. The balls were cold and dry. Would of must rather had a McDonald's hamburger patty.   Next up, the duck confit. It tasted as if it was sitting next to an underpowered heat lamp. Luke warm duck on top of a cold pastry.   There was also a dish I forget the meat but it was decorated with cranberry juice. The think is it looked as if the dish was part of a CSI investigation. Random red splotches on a white plate.   The last course was a underwhelming turkey breast. Too add to the ongoing disappointment, it was not only cold, but extremely dry.   Lastly came the desserts.  A brown log that had a smear of chocolate. The last time I saw that was after a night at White Castle. The final piece of resistance a \"Christmas tree\". It was essentially a Home Depot fern with Hersey kiss decorations.  Such a juvenile display of creativity.   $95 dollars for a prefix. By far the worst culinary experience Montreal has to offer in both quality and value."}
{"text":"This is a place to go to experience sheer beauty and extravagance when it comes to the room and their great wine list. I've attended two business dinners here. While I truly enjoyed drinking expensive French wines, the food is just too unconventional and strange. The other night I had the asparagus starter, which consisted of one under cooked fresh green spear, and one semi pickled white spear,  The spears laid on two different kinds of foam and covered with flower petals and other garnishes.  It looked more like a flower arrangement than a dish.  For the main I had a strange concoction of freshly made fava beans pasta served with seafood and proscuito sauce. The pasta reminded me of buckwheat soba noodles.  Unfortunately this mixture was only tad better than the two spears of asparagus.  However my carnivore colleagues thoroughly enjoyed their steak and foie gras."}
{"text":"Great place to have a very early breakfast on a Sunday (from 7am! Yes 7am on a Sunday), tasty menu and very affordable prices for this type of restaurant. Normally never busy, so if you looking to a stunning place where you will feel cozy and have a great service, this place will definitely please you"}
{"text":"For our early valentines dinner...decided to give this place a try....  First off, was dissappointed with the bread and butter.   Bread was stale.and cold. Was not fresh at all. Butter was bland and tasted like a mix between whipped and margarine...i had to season with salt and pepper.  Appys were watermelon with radish and goat cheese...tasted so refreshing and reminded me of tuscany...  Mains ordered were...pasta timi....spaghetti with poached lobster ( yes!) ...mushrooms, sweet bread.. and a rich truffle sauce.  The execution was perfect. Everything complemented each other and didnt overpower each ingridients identity.  The best part was the truffle sauce...so creamy, rich, and flavourful. Perfectly paired with the poached lobster. Lobster was poached just right..not overcooked or undercooked. There was enough serving on the plate. Mushrooms were also done well. Tender and soaked up the flavor of the truffle sauce...  Next main was salmon...the presentation was bar-none. The plate looked like a garden pond. It was epic and impressive . Salmon was so moist and tender...it was a step or two after sashimi...so fresh fresh fresh ....  The onion bulbs also impressed me to no end...when sliced in half...i found out that the chef had stuffed them with some.kind of candied fruit...like peach....it completed the onions really well. The attention to detail was phenomenal....  Lastly, the ambiance of the place.was very very impressibe.. the roman columns and chandliers made you feel like royalty.  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I visited Montreal with a friend last week and this place turned out to be our favorite. We spotted the beautiful Hotel Le St-James building on our way from dinner - it was impossible not to stop by to look what it is like inside. We ended up having a couple of martinis at the bar here-the drinks were superb. The restaurant is beautiful, the stuff is extremely professional and nice. XO has the sophisticated vibe of the New York City speakeasies so it is perfect for a classy night out."}
{"text":"Over the top!!!  Best gazpacho ever along with the most unusual and tasty steak tartar with quail egg. Cheeses and deserts were wonderful. All in a quiet and sophisticated setting. Best French rosé in a long time as well as a great Cotes de Roussilion."}
{"text":"We had our first breakfast here the other morning and were not disappointed.  Vicki had the three egg white omelette and fresh berries while i had the banana and coconut pancakes and berries.  The service was very good, food tasty and well presented.  Definitely one of the nicer hotel breakfasts i have had, up there with the georges v though the dining room is a bit dark for the morning"}
{"text":"We stayed at the St. James Hotel for four nights while in Montreal. I can't say enough wonderful things about the Hotel, the lounge and the staff. We visited the bar/lounge twice upon our stay. Both times, with different bartenders, and the service was awesome! The bartenders bent over backwards to make sure we had drinks that we enjoyed. They also offered some information about the area and recommended some different places to visit. Totally unpretentious and incredibly friendly. A very beautiful setting! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"In the luxurious Le St. James Hotel is a one stellar bar: the XO. First of all the room is the height of old-school luxury: columns, mouldings, height, drama, rich finishes. All of this is bathed in a combination of fixed incandescent light (subdued) and LED lighting that slowly cycles through jewel tones.  The bartenders are calm and expert. They are also most hospitable and kind with no aloofness from working in such a rarified atmosphere. Observing their technique makes the drinks taste even better. They make all of the classics plus some special St. James drinks. They will make any drink exactly to your specifications.  The bar food menu has some great items. The Montreal \"Smoked Meat\" Sandwich with fries is not to be missed. It may be the best pastrami sandwich ever. For dessert, consider the strawberry dessert, which features fresh Quebec strawberries, strawberry gel, strawberry paper, maple crumbles, hazelnut ice cream and stracciatella cream (wow!!).  For an after dinner drink, try \"Neige\" which is a local apple ice wine aged three years. It is an utterly complex nectar.  The XO Bar is not inexpensive, but if you order carefully, you can experience a bit of luxury without pretense for a reasonable tab."}
{"text":"XO Le Restaurant is located inside the Hotel Le St. James, right off of St. Jacques.  The restaurant offers breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, and even a bar menu, as well as an extensive cocktail/wine list.  I came here for breakfast, and tried the Oeufs Benedictine avec Saumon Fume - eggs Benedict with smoked salmon.  There was a generous amount of smoked salmon laid on top of two English muffins, perfectly poached eggs, a hollandaise sauce, some capers and diced chives, as well as a side of roasted fingerling potatoes.  I wasn't really a fan of the cold smoked salmon with the lukewarm hollandaise sauce; I actually preferred the muffins with the poached eggs.  The fingerling potatoes were perfectly roasted and yummy.  To start off the meal, a complimentary smoothie 'shooter' was given - a raspberry mixed with yogurt; it was super tart.  There were some Greaves preserves at the table, so that was slightly of a tease as there was no bread to spread them on with T___T  Service was great, and James was attentive and very welcoming.  Housed inside the formal Banker's Hall, the restaurant is beautiful, as it has a main dining area, a lounge, and two mezzanines - I loved the pillars and the beautiful chandeliers, and the comfortable sofa seats with cushions.  I'd probably try a regular eggs Benedict next time, or try out their Petit-Dejeanur St. James plate instead.  +beautiful ambiance and decor +friendly staff - ask for Mr. James :D"}
{"text":"We have been to XO for drink a few times because our friends were staying at the hotel.  Always wanted to try the restaurant so for my birthday my partner surprised me with reservations on a Sunday evening.  On a cold snowy night the restaurant was quite but for us it felt like we had the place to ourselves!  Service was on point!   We started with Cauliflower Risotto & Seared Scallops.  My partner loved his Cauliflower Risotto while I thought my scallops were \"good\". For the main course I had the Black Cod (Perfection with a seared crisp) & my partner had the Pan Seared Duck Breast! Both were excellent!  Desert we had the Chocolate cake with maple ice-cream which was equally special served with melted chocolate to dip the cake, grilled marshmallow bar into! As it was my birthday the kitchen had sent out a few other surprises for us including Nutella custard with white chocolate and before we the night was out black berries with a drizzled chocolate written \"Happy Birthday\"! We had a amazing evening!   The decor and the restaurant is gorgeous with the vaulting ceilings to the chandlers!   As it was quite we even toured the 2nd floor which was magnificent as it is eye level with the Chandlers!  We are sure to return to have drinks or dinner on the second level!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the food (well, maybe 3.5), but 0 for service, which reached the \"holy hell how is it so bad?\" territory.  Literally every single dish ordered, all the way down to the post-meal cappuccino, was given to the wrong person. How does that happen? Unless our server has dyscalculia, I just don't see how it's possible (though if he did, I feel kinda bad, though maybe he could've said something?).  Further, we were either in \"smother with upsell\" mode or \"quietly ignore\" mode throughout the meal.  Coup de grace was asking for a wine bottle recommendation under $70 and being told he couldn't recommend anything. Really? Then either (1) don't have them on the menu or (2) lie. But please, don't (3) make us feel cheap at your 3x-4x markup of some mediocre-to-begin with wine offerings. Completely offensive.  My meal was the curry-cauliflower soup (nice taste, a good amount of heat, but a little unfulfilling) and the duck confit salad. Not *great* confit, but not bad. Wouldn't recommend it unless you really really are in the mood and have not-too-high expectations.  Montreal has way too much good food and service to return here."}
{"text":"Great service. I had the French toast which was the best I've had in my life. They also give you a smoothie to start off. They are generous with the hot water for tea."}
{"text":"I went to XO for Valentine's Day, the course was fixed, couldn't order what I like, so I was a little be worried about the food. But l'm so impressed by all the dishes, truly loved them all. I'll definitely go back and bring my mom"}
{"text":"Magnifique! Sophisticated and the cuisine was spectacular. This is the essence of fine dining and ambiance."}
{"text":"The breathtaking moments start when you walk through the door.  The opulence and beauty that mixes old Montreal with modern touches.  It's hard to take your eyes off of the decor.  Food - Tasty but nothing that blew my mind away or that created the same sense of surprise that I had with their decor.   Their tasting menu is worth doing but come hungry.  They do have a vegetarian tasting menu as well and for a fancy place, really impressive that it is more than just a lot of salads.  Presentation of it is just as good and they add some flair to dishes.  I prefer a simple, explosive flavor versus presentation.  That I prefer clean.  But it was a nice touch.  Decor - I could go on and on, but if you are aiming to impress or have a special meal...this is it.  Do it.  Seating is so comfortable you could almost nap.  Price - So reasonable if you don't drink too much.  That always drives up a bill and we just had the one bottle for a few of us girls. Without a lot of drinking, its well priced.  Service - Wonderful, but slow.  They want you to hang out and stay and enjoy yourself. Food takes a while to come out.  It took us 3 hours to do a 3 course meal...so just don't try coming here for a quick bite.  Notable Extras - Have I mentioned how pretty it is?"}
{"text":"Our first time in Montreal, found this restaurant on Open Table & decided to give it a try. We were celebrating my parents anniversary & also my sister's in laws anniversary.  The staff was so accommodating, the food was incredible (highly recommend the cobia dish & the rack of lamb!) The overall ambiance in the restaurant is elegant & classy. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Located in the Hotel Le St James, the hotel itself, has a very upscale interior design with an old-world charm visual. XO's style is classic with hints of modern. Loved the beautiful arches and stairways in the restaurant.   I don't want to ruin the experience for those who like XO or restaurants like this- but it's really not for me...I want to sit back, crack up if I want to and not be or feel stuffy in a restaurant.   And please, don't get it twisted...Service and decor were really a 5-tops, but if I can give it a 10, I would. Vanessa was really pleasant; striking small conversations as I tried to polish my college French. But, I don't want to go against the grain, while XO is very opulent, which I took a liking to, I was expecting something heartier, and in the end, was actually more like nouveau French (if that's a term). My meal was small for the price and my husband's seafood dish was dry. Dinner was not mind blowing, but XO, was fine dining...in appearance, at its best."}
{"text":"I have to ask -- Why is this place empty?  This was quite possibly one of the better tastings I have *ever* had in terms of flavor, and that's including the likes of French Laundry and Per Se.    It's in the bottom floor of a hotel, and we walked up the stairs which were flanked by a pair of Ferrari's and a Bently (somewhat intimidating) to the doorman who let us in.  It's Interesting decor in the main area once you pass reception, kind of a mix between modern (with the huge XO sign) and classic with the enormous faux pillars 'holding up' the overlooking balconies.    We had the tasting around 8pm for two and we were 1 of 3 tables in the entire restaurant -- It was a Sunday, but 3 tables?  Weird, but whatever.  I took a quick look at the menu and noticed that the tasting was not on the menu, not sure if the waiter was going to advertise it as I inquired the moment he came up.  It was surprising it wasn't on there -- but I guess I didn't give him a chance.  Anyway, I immediately asked if I could substitute the fish/seafood dishes, and they were very accommodating and said it was no problem.    My first dish (a substitute) was some kind of cured beef (don't recall the name) that was lightly cooked and placed in a broth, awesome -- I have never actually experienced a beef flavor like that.    Next (a substitute) was veal cheek and some sort of savory onions.  I have never had veal cheek before, and it was very tender and slightly fatty, but not chewy in the slightest.  The onions were a perfect flavor to add to the beef.  My date had the first two seafood dishes, the first being a trio of different flavored oysters, and the second being escalops of some sort.  She said they were both very delicious, but I cant really comment beyond that.  Third was a pork risotto with thin pieces of pork within the risotto made with pork stock -- absolutely delicious.  Both of us were asking: \"How is risotto really this good?\"  Fourth was probably my favorite dish, thinly sliced (filet I think) beef over mashed potatoes and (vidalia I think) onions.  Beef was cooked perfectly, and the mashed potatoes and onions were a perfect match with the beef.  For the fifth course we added a cheese plate and opted to go with all five cheeses.  All were from Quebec, and all were....Amazing.  The leftovers are in my hotel fridge as we speak, we did not want to waste any of it.  Additionally they had these *very* thinly sliced pieces of toasted bread that came with it.  I inquired, and apparently to get the slices that thin, the freeze the bread before slicing it -- pretty inventive.  The sixth course was desert, and it was a carrot cake with pineapple glaze and curry ice cream.  I was skeptical of the ice cream, but it all went very well together.  They finish up with a chocolate dish with nuts of some sort, I only tired a piece, it was pretty good.    Additionally, it was our anniversary and they brought out a special flaming parfait type thing with candies at the end, pretty classy.  I only mentioned it in passing when we first talked to the doorman when we got there -- pretty awesome attention to detail.   We also had the wine pairings for an additional 50$ or so, WELL worth it.  Every pairing was spot on, and they also paired the cheese with a great port for me and an excellent red for my date.  If you come here for the tasting you would have to be crazy not to get the pairing for just another 50$.  All in all, probably one of the best tastings I have had, especially for that much money.  All in we were at like 350$ before tip, really not that bad for a 3 hour dinner for seven courses with wine pairings + cheese and 3 drinks.  Again, I enjoyed this more than the likes of Per Se, French Laundry (why in the hell do neither of these have wine pairings?!) and others.  It was a great experience and I would certainly go back.  5 Stars hands down."}
{"text":"Had a steak off the bar menu. Outstanding. Girlfriend had the Duck and raved about it. Outstanding food and service. Well worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"Love this space.  We came early (pre-concert), shared a bunch of appetitzers from the bar menu, then when the dinner menu became available (after 6pm), had shared a couple entrees.  The food combo and flavours were excellent. Staff service was wonderful, and we had great comfy seats in a gigantic booth overlooking most of the lounge!"}
{"text":"Tea at the St. James is fantastic.  The decor is unbelievable.  (I've had tea at the Queen Elizabeth hotel too, and it was OK, but served in the lobby, and I didn't give it high marks).  My wife and I had tea here, and although expensive - was up there on the scale of wow.  If you are in Montreal and you want to have a little romance with your significant other - grab tea at the St. James.    They sat us at a window table with huge wingback chairs that dwarfed us.  Then they started with a glass of wine, and then began tea.  Tea here is very traditional, including sandwiches, scones, etc. and you get stuffed.  I know it sounds bit un-man-ly, but I love having tea ever since my wife gave up the secret of the food.  If you are going to do tea in Montreal and you want the total experience, this is the only place to go.  Suck it - Queen E!"}
{"text":"I had the 6-course tasting menu and came on a week night when the restaurant was at about 25% capacity. For good reason.   First, the service. Nowhere near the quality of a three-star restaurant (Sorry, John P--you're wrong). Don't mention this restaurant in the same sentence as Per Se, French Laundry, Alinea, or Daniel--I've been to all of them and this place is nowhere near that kind of quality. We had to ask for drinks several times. Our food was awkwardly paced with 10 minute breaks between some dishes and then 2 minute breaks between other dishes. At best, this would be a one-star restaurant in terms of service.  Second, the food. It was ok. It wasn't great, and it wasn't bad. If I was staying at the St James and just needed a meal without leaving, I'd come here, but with all the alternatives around the neighborhood, forget it. Here's the difference between Per Se and French Laundry--they never repeat a single item on their (larger) tasting menu. In our six course menu, we had some form of curry twice (33% of the dishes), some form of chocolate three times (50% of the dishes), and everything was overly sweet. Each item by itself would have been good, but the point of a tasting menu is that dishes should interact and lead into each other.    Would I recommend this place for the food? No. Was I impressed by the wine list? Yes."}
{"text":"Amazing. Lovely. Lovely hotel. Had beautiful breakfast yesterday, now mimosas for the birthday boy. Outstanding service."}
{"text":"Great dining experience  Would definitely recommend this restaurant for service and food quality. The decor and ambience is excellent, the service is stellar and you are not rushed through your meal."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar only. We grabbed a cocktail before heading out for dinner.   We are staying at this hotel. The restaurant is beautiful. There are a handful of sets at the bar or a few tables in the bar area.   We were immediately greater by staff. We ordered our standard French 75 drink. Wow! The best French 75 I have ever had! With fresh squeezed lemon and generous pours of gin, these were simply amazing.   The drinks are very expensive, however. But worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming.   Went with a group of 8, place was empty aside from a large group (30+).   Ambiance: 4-stars, classy.   Menu: limited selection, meat heavy and lacks any sophistication.   Food: onion soup tasted bland (colored water), goat cheese beet salad had no goat cheese, etc. Filet was good but consisted of a chunk of meet with no sides. Salmon was a ridiculously small, overcooked piece. 1 star.   Drinks: great wine selection, decent cocktail list. 3-stars  Service: attentive, but sommelier kept skipping the two ladies at the table, which was rude (and you should always start with the ladies...) 2-stars."}
{"text":"Every once in a while, I have the desire to really go all out with a meal. Never mind picking a few options from the menu - I want the tasting menu with the wine pairings. I want to take out my tie, pocket square and jacket and go fancy. Go somewhere where the initial though is \"Well I can't do this too often\" and the bill at the end of the night reflects that. In the end, the experience is what I am after. Well, last month, I was presented with such a opportunity in one of the most beautiful spots in Montreal.  The St. James Hotel in the old port is one of Montreal most well known boutique hotel. Located inside the hotel is XO Le Restaurant. A restaurant that certainly makes quite the impression when you walk in. Beautiful high ornate ceilings, chandeliers, Roman columns, beautiful staircases leading to 2 mezzanines overlooking a lounge space and a dining space - it is quite the looker. You can't help but stare around you throughout your time in the restaurant.  For this evening, at the recommendation of one of my dining companions' friends (who, for the purpose of disclosure here, works in the restaurant and led our service), we were going with their signature 6 course tasting menu with associated wine pairings.  Our first course was thinly sliced Princess scallops with nitrogen frozen oranges and a trio of cauliflower paired with a Niagara Riesling. A precursor of things to come, the presentation was beautiful - the whole dish in a large seashell, sitting on a bed of rocks with dry ice poured underneath by our server. A little over the top with the dry ice? Sure but it added extra flair to the whole proceedings which definitely seemed in line with the setting. The dish itself was quite good - the scallops were perfectly executed, the orange added some zest and the cauliflower a little crunch.  The second course brought forth Black bass with white beans, parsley puree and a Meyer lemon beurre blanc sauce paired with a glass of Meursault. Another great looking dish that was delicious as well. The fish was cooked perfectly - flaky and moist but with a great skin crispness on top. The beurre blanc brought some richness and had the unmistakable hint of the Meyer lemons.  The third course was a little richer as we got a Foie gras Tartin with apple ice cider jelly on top, pecan crumble and a apple maple reduction paired with a lovely French Chenin blanc. Just an amazing combination of great technique and great flavours. The fatty foie gras, the sweetness of the apple maple reduction, the beautiful texture of the ice cider jelly and the extremely fine texture of the pecan crumble - there was not a single thing not to like on this plate.  The fourth course continued along similar lines as the previous one as we got a white truffle risotto with a white chocolate sauce and chestnuts, all paired with a glass of 2007 Barbaresco Paje. This was by far the most filling dish we got on this evening. The white chocolate sauce was a surprise to all of us when it was mentioned but once we tried it, it made perfect sense - a touch of sweetness to offset the inherent creaminess and richness of risotto. The addition of white truffle was wholly unnecessary but oh so perfect.  The fifth course was Stag with sweet potato done 2 ways and dehydrated Nutella, paired with (appropriately enough) a glass of Stag's leap Petit Syrah. The sweet potatoes, both in puree and galette form, were delicious and the Stag itself was well prepared - very much showcasing the natural gaminess of the meat. The crazy element here was the dehydrated Nutella - such a unique preparation of that item but one that works so well within this dish. The chocolate and hazelnut flavours paired very nicely with the lean meat.  Prior to the final course of dessert, we got a palate cleanser in the form of a Hibiscus tapioca. This was the one dish of the meal that I did not enjoy. It certainly served its purpose as a palate cleanser and it was beautiful to look at but Hibiscus is not a flavour that I enjoy.  The dessert course itself was a orange flan with fennel ice cream and 3 crumbles: olive oil, black pepper and sea salt. Very unique flavours for a dessert but everything worked very nicely. Great texture to both the ice-cream and the flan. The 3 crumbles were amazing - great flavours without being overbearing. Individually, each worked well with the flan but they also worked well in combination.  And to finish off the whole, a small plat including a Mint chip, house caramel and dark chocolate truffle were provided with the checks. All 3 were great - particularly the house caramel.   4 hours after we sat down, we were stuffed - 6 courses and 5 glasses of wine will do that to you. This meal was very much an experience - a pricey one for sure - but an experience nevertheless worth having. The service was impeccable, the decor jaw dropping, the food and wine spot-on. The sticker shock may be hard to get by but believe me - you'll be satisfied in the end.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Saturday late lunch at XO of salmon tartare (offered in 3 or 5 ounce portion sizes) and duck tartare (only one serving size, about 3 ounces).  Both were served with a pistachio crouton.  Basically, very thinly sliced bread with pistachios baked in, and baked (so it was crunchy like a cracker) with butter.  We ate everything, would definitely repeat this lunch."}
{"text":"Omg this is the best restaurant I h as ve been at in years!  My husband and I shared the venison and filet.  Magnifique!  Our server was the most hospitable and knowlegeable ever.  The food, wine as nd service are worth the trip."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Very fancy. Great place for a nice night out, when you want to get dolled up. Even though they were almost closing, and we were one of two couples left, they treated us amazing. Wonderful customer service. The restaurant itself looks like something out of a movie. Beautiful!! The food was delicious. We had the filet and it was cooked perfect!! Overall wonderful experience!!"}
