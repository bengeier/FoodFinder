{"text":"I'm giving this 2 stars because the front staff is not friendly at all. Food is great though. Price is great. I own a restaurant and staff is what makes the place. Having staff that is incompetent only devalues your food further. Get staff that speak English, knows your product and greets customers well.  
On the signage outside; you have a sign of a drink called Falooda but I asked the waitress and she gave me a dirty look. I told her it's on your A-frame outside and she was confused further. I gave up on her and asked another waitress and she was even more incompetent and rude. 
Anyways; hope the owners read this and make changes. You've got a good product."}
{"text":"Highly recommend!  Tried chicken biryani and butter chicken and naan and both were delicious and great value for $$.  Looking forward to doing a larger order next time..!"}
{"text":"the food was tasty but the staff here was rude. i think this may be the same staff that used to be rude at food time.  the place a couple of doors over is excellent. my opinion."}
{"text":"I dined here for a birthday. A group of 8, size of the restaurant is medium & we were seated in the middle of the dining space. 1st impressions were optimistic but by end of the night I knew I wouldn't be returning. Food quality was alright, not the worst or the best I've had. What essentially turned my experience down was service & cleanliness. There weren't enough plates/glasses/cutlery until we asked - it wasn't too busy either. Had to ask for knives & my knife was dirty, I could tell someone probably wiped it because I could see small old food residue in the dry wipe marks. This turned me off immediately but still I remained hopeful that everything else would go well. Remainder of the night, my polite uncle who took charge dealing with the waiters, had to get up & even help himself to things that should've been brought over by waiters. I understand them forgetting once/twice but this was the case most of the time, the waiters seemed confused when basic things were requested - maybe they were new staff, I'll give them that but shouldn't be happening with all staff. The staff didn't seem friendly & barely smiled. Sauce bottles were dirty around the opening, with either dried/fresh sauce still on the sides. Near the end of the night, my cousin went to use the single men's washroom (2 washrooms, single toilets/sinks), he came back saying he couldn't use it as someone destroyed the toilet with #2. We sat for another 20/30 mins eating dessert & noticed none of the staff went to clean the toilets even after he'd let them know."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Went for take out. The person at the counter could not speak a word of English. Why would you hire someone that doesn't speak some English. Not everyone speaks Urdu...food maybe good...crappy service. Don't waste your time nor money.
Tried this new place out of the blue next door. 
King Samosa and Sweets.
Amazing service and good food."}
{"text":"The food at Usmania Grill is delicious especially their Kebabs. Best in Pickering by far, only reason I wouldn't give them five stars is because their greatest downfall is management. Employees here are very nice however their management is horrible with food running out frequently at early hours, last minute cancellations and delays in serving. Overall very vey disorganized so if you will be eating there be prepared for that great food, polite employees however very disorganized."}
{"text":"This review is based on several visits.  The food has been consistently great and priced well.  Removed stars for the cleanliness and bad attitude of the staff.  I'm here now and just want to get some windex and a rag to clean the front door!!! 
The staff is never really that nice, don't expect any thank you's or even a smile.  We'll be back because we like the food, the owner is super nice too.. It could be a five star if they just fixed a few things.  Clean the front window, it's a customers first impression, train staff to be nice to all customers, smile, say thank you, etc."}
{"text":"This place takes way too long. If you want their food, consider take out and order at least 60 minutes in advance. must order fromSuggest doing take out."}
{"text":"So happy to find a good local Indian and Pakistani restaurant! Visited for the first time and have to say was very impressed by the food and the quantity that they give. There were 3 of us and we ordered the BBQ platter for 4 which was a very good amount of food. We ended up taking leftovers home. The meats in the dishes were tender and well seasoned. It came with chicken tikka, bihari kebobs, tandoori chicken and seekh kebobs served on top of biryani rice. We were all very satisfied and happy with the service as well. Definitely recommend people to come try. You won't be disappointed. The only thing they need to do is to turn the heat on higher in the restaurant. We were eating with our coats on the whole time!"}
{"text":"The biryani is really good. The service takes quite long. I recommend placing your order before you get there so it'll be ready. The restaurant looked very clean."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and we loved the place.  The platters are definitely worth your money.  Also you have to order the naan bread with potato inside cus it's sooo good.

The staff is also super nice and can't get enough of their biryani rice.  I would definitely come back here for sure.  I didn't even know this place existed in Pickering."}
{"text":"If you were an avid visitor to Food Time throughout the years, than you are in for a treat. Service is average, but you're coming for the food not the company. Their space is aesthetically pleasing, and wins in terms of decor it strikes more tens across the board. The portions are Great and you get amazing kebabs and it's well worth the wait for the value. If you are looking for more options in the GTA in Durham region I definitely reccomend this place!"}
