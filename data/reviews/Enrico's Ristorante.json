{"text":"My boyfriend and I happened upon Enrico's on Ellsworth Avenue in Shadyside one Friday night in the spring when we were desperate to eat outdoors.  We had driven past several other establishments packed with people celebrating the weekend when we spotted diners at iron tables with white linen tablecloths sitting outside Enrico's at the corner of Ellsworth and College.  Voila!  We had the first of many lovely dinners that evening, loving the neighborhood feel, the excellent service and the very fine food.  The menu changes frequently, and the salads, entrees and desserts are both excellent and creative.  Enrico's has interesting wines, and the atmosphere indoors is as informal and hip as the outdoors is urban and lively.  We're hooked!"}
{"text":"While my dinner companions were raving about how amazing and delicious their meals were, mine was just sub par. An Italian sausage rissoto with undercooked rice that was crunchy in a middle and too much salt in the dish. I paired it with a glass of pinot grigio which was great. I was also looking forward to check out the dessert menu but instead the waitress plopped down our check instead. Thanks...  The atmosphere could use a little bit more AC - it was stuffy in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I always walked by Enrico's and looked intrigued.  The space is beautiful, right next to a laundromat. I purchased a coupon for it but never found a night it was going to work when the were open (they are closed on Sundays.)  Finally we broke down and made it and enjoyed their fresh food. The food was great and just what I wanted.  Great Italian food in a warm and inviting place."}
