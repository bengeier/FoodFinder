{"text":"Foods good very friendly workers can't wait to come back again to enjoy legit Thai foood!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, and it comes in huge portions! Nice decor, and great service. The Thai tea drink with any plate recommended."}
{"text":"Nothing special but still not a bad place if you're in the mood for Thai. Ordered the basil rice and spicy chicken pad thai. Both were good, not the best, but not the worst either. Both dishes totalled $20 roughly which is typical in Newmarket. Server was friendly and accomodating. Atmosphere a little depressing though.

Satisfied but would probably not repeat."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food in town!!!! I can even begin to explain how horrible it was.... A friend her boy friend and myself did take out 2 nights ago spent a good chunk of money. .. they package the food with juice on its side so now its leaking and stained onto her her seat and they messed up our order and had plastic in the mango salad. .. I took a bite of the calamari and some pad Thai which btw was dry as shit  and tasted nasty. .. within the course of 30 seconds after ingesting it, I had to run to the washroom and then it hit the other 2. So we ended up throwing everything out, called to let them know and their solution: we'll reimburse you for the mango salad give you 2 free spring rolls... then they said well you should have brought it back. .. so they want us to load everything back up in the car waste our gas and which btw were all feeling pukeish so no one really wants to get up and move. .. Worst Thai restaurant in town"}
{"text":"Family friendly 

The food and service was excellent. Portions of each dish was exceptionally large for the price you pay. My fiancé and my friend had to share all of our orders and yet had plenty of left overs. Food was very tasty and authentic coming from a Laos background. Highly recommended for all thai lovers in Newmarket."}
{"text":"Great basil chicken.  I asked for mine extra spicy.  It was excellent.  Have searched all over the Newmarket/Aurora area to fulfil my Thai craving.  This one hits the spot."}
{"text":"Tuptim Thai is my family's favourite take-out Thai.  Our food always arrives within 30 minutes."}
{"text":"We came out of the January cold into a warm, friendly and welcoming environment to food that was exquisitely and carefully prepared.  The restaurant decor works in a charming way with unusual and fake plants amidst bric a brac.  Nice place settings and the use of cloth tablecloths and napkins make it seem a little more upscale while the menu offers complete dinners at bargain prices.  We tried the dinner for four and we were delighted with the food and our final bill - less than $15 a person.  Fabulous pad thai  and absolutely marvellous curries.   I think I will become a regular."}
{"text":"The quality of food here never disappoints. Service has always been very good. This is by far my fave spot for Thai food. We always order the Spicy Fish, papaya salad and stir fry Seafood with rice noodles. The mango salad is great too, I find it a little too strong with the green cilantro leaves that they put. Next time I will have those leaves on the side just in case. 
Overall, this restaurant is worth a try. You will never be disappointed. I highly recommend my friends to eat here too."}
{"text":"My go to thai place close to work! I find the dishes are better than some of the popular thai places in downtown Toronto - this cute family business offer great variety on lunch specials. 

Things I've had:
- Chicken pad thai (delicious) ask for it to be spicy for that extra kick
- BBQ pork vermicelli bowl - perfect lunch if you don't want anything too heavy because its loaded with vegetables! This is served cold.
- Thai style cold rolls - ask for both sauces (peanut) its amazing!! 

If you are in the area, you must give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Came for a Sunday dinner, nice quiet place. Quick and fast service. Ask for xtra spicy and was very satisfy. Will come again!"}

A local lunch spot for area manufacturing work peeps."}
{"text":"Perfect comfort food! I am normally super picky but everything I had asked for was made just how I like it. Defiantly the best Thai food in Newmarket!"}
{"text":"It is the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to in the Town of Newmarket . Their food has a great taste and fresh, like Thailand that I go there every year in winter time. I go to this restaurant 3 times a week. The staff are very nice and friendly. Wish you success"}
{"text":"This place is my family's thai place of choice so more often than not I end up dining here with them when I go back to visit. 
There is nothing wrong with Tup Tim, but it just doesn't stand out in my recollections of thai food in times past. Some thai places stand out and some blend in, and Tuptim is one that blends in. Now, there are some points I should mention:
Portions are huge for most things, noodle portions are average
Huge menu with lots of options
Everyone seems to be obsessed with their sweet and sour fish (except me), so I should mention this dish. It is deep fried fish in a sweet sauce with pineapples and peppers. Needless to say, it does not reheat well, so make sure you share because the portion is insane.
Decor is Thai tacky chic, to the max, so don't come here for the ambience!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times in the past. The food was great. The portions were perfect for lunch, never being too big and it was close to work. However, two days ago when I ordered my lunch for take out, I found three hairs in my lunch. That really grossed me out. Stuff happens from time to time, but to find three seems more than a mistake. Sadly, it's put me off. This used to be a frequent place for me."}
{"text":"Having gone to many Thai restaurants, franchise and non-franchise based, Tuptim Thai is among the many top Thai restaurants I would definitely return to for Thai food. The pine apple fried rice and the yellow curry I ordered was delicious and fulfilled my desire and craving for Thai food. The portions were unexpectedly generous despite the restaurant not being franchise owned. There were many options to choose from on their menu as well. Staff were friendly, and greeted me both when I came and left! Service, I would say was commendable! The restaurant fully embraced Thai culture through \"temple-type\" atmosphere and decorations. For a family owned and non franchise Thai restaurant, Tuptim definitely deserves praises!"}
{"text":"I must say, I was quite impressed with the food quality and service I received at Tuptim. It is hard to come by quality Southeast Asian food, particularly outside of Toronto. I definitely recommend the Papaya Salad and Chicken Pad Thai, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"For a  white-washed suburban area like Newmarket, Tuptim is A-OK for it's price and quality. $7 for a generous portion of lunch special, with just a few dollars more can get you a small bowl of soup and fresh, made in house spring roll.  

Considering where you are, don't expect to get Thai food that will blow your mind, but for the location, price, and quality, I had a surprisingly pleasant experience."}

Tuptim Thai Cuisine -- The Best Thai Cuisine in Town?

I should have know! I couldn't argue that statement since Tuptim Thai is the only Thai restaurant I been to in Newmarket, maybe it is relatively the best compare to the rest in town....

Nestled in a more industrial area as my GPS took me past garages and industrial area until I arrive at the door of Tuptim.

We decided to share:

L-1 Minced B.B.Q. Beef or Chicken (Larb)  $8.50 
- Did my friend order Chicken for us? How come now is Beef?
- It tasted pretty good with a nice kick of spices, herb and saltiness

Lunch Special Beef Pad Ped with rice, spring roll and soup $7.99
- Beef with hot sauce is not bad
- But I definitely skip that Hot and Sour Soup.. 

D-2 Black Rice with Thai Custard $4.50
- Why it looks totally different from the photo?? 
- Why is the custard looks rock solid?
- Why is the rice dry and hard?
- Why this thing taste so bad?
- Why they still have it on the menu?
- Maybe this is the sign for me to go back to Thailand soon?

Service is nice and friendly. really genuine Thai hospitality! I just wish the food is better....

Seems like they just updated the lunch menu since we visited and lunch are now $6.99 with over 20 choices! 

Tuptim Thai might need to concentrate on downsizing their menu, as with such a huge selections it is really hard to guarantee every dishes would be great.. I don't understand why they even serving Pho?!"}
{"text":"Got three entrées for about $35 pick up. Not bad food. Pad Thai is a bit on the salty side. Not bad."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service is what you would expect.  I, however, rate 3 stars due to the price of some of the menu items and that the atmosphere makes me feel like I'm spending an hour at temple."}
{"text":"Awful food, couldn't even finish. Somehow even the candy they gave out at the end tasted bad too."}
{"text":"Great take out....ordered dinner of three and there were no leftovers so either portion is too small or it is soooo good!  Delicious curry, pad Thai and we had this beef dish with broccoli that was amazing.  Support this place....non franchise, great value and excellent food."}
