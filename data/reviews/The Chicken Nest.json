{"text":"Delicious food!! I just had a catered lunch by the Chicken Nest and the food was well prepared and presented. We had these asian type noodles....sooooo good!!! Everyone raved about the food. I can't wait to be able to use them again in what I hope will be the near future."}
{"text":"The food is out of this world I love everything I my husband and I tried big portions and fast friendly service! I would recommend the spicy Thai chicken if you like spice."}
{"text":"Passable, but incredibly overpriced. $18.95 for a half roasted chicken, which was no better or worse than a grocery store bird (or Swiss Chalet, for that matter.) We gave it a try for take out as it's in our neighborhood and we're always looking for something to try, but we won't likely order again. Not great value.  Although, we did get a laugh out of the roll they included - which was totally inedible and hard as a rock. So there's that."}
{"text":"Just shared a Mediterranean plate with Sharma, grilled merguez sausage, grilled chicken, hummus, olives, carrots, baba ganoush, pita - the works! Food was delicious, ample and our waitress was friendly and attentive. Great food and great service. Will return."}
{"text":"Horrible. The portions were small for the price. $22 for schnitzel with vegetables, and I got a medium sized processed piece of chicken... pathetic and definitely not competitive. I also ordered the Chichen Nest Sub, which was advertised as 'piled high' for the price of $20. What I got was basically meat free, and amounted to $20 of a cibatta bun with fries. I also ordered their 'world famous chicken soup'... let me tell you... the base tastes store-bought... with a few scraps of chicken for authenticity. Definitely NOT worth the $8.50 they are charging.  Greedy Ownership... poor value.  Spend your money wisely."}
{"text":"I like the chicken Caesar wrap but service is not good. It takes at least 45 minutes to get food when we were the only ones there. And another 1 hour for waiter to get our bill, plus I saw her eat with her fingers as she was making my wrap. Gross"}
