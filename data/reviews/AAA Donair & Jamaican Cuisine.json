{"text":"Straight up creepy. The guys there are extremely perverted. The owner charged up extra when it came towards the bill $15 extra. The only thing good was the Jamaican patty. Food is bland and not real Jamaican food. It felt like they just reheated it in the back and served it because it came to out to the table in less then 1 minute. Not coming here again. Overpriced everything."}
{"text":"AAA Donair & Jamaican Cuisine is an absolute gem in our city. From the moment you step inside, you'll feel like you've been transported to some remote destination in Jamaica. Between the Jamaican hut interior and the lively reggae music, this place is as close to the Caribbean as Calgarians can get without having to take a flight.

I recommend trying their authentic rotis, curries and dumplings. Two words: Yah Man."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetable roti and a side of rice to go. It was delicious. Good portion size. The owner Alvin was very helpful and friendly. His Jamaican decor is fun to look at while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"i love the atmosphere here. the decorations, music, smell of the food.. i wish there were places like this in calgary. ive tried the salt fish & jerk chicken here. not the best ive ever had but still pretty good, very flavorful. i do loveeee the rice & peas here tho. and the peanut punch that comes in a little juice box. its different but its delicious! perfect to put out that fire in your mouth from the spiciness of the food!"}
