{"text":"Decent food served quick and hot. Staff very friendly and honest. We eat there every couple weeks for breakfast and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was very good and served quickly.  I had the English Prime Rib with mashed potatoes and green vegetables. The only complaint that I would have would be about the seating.  Particularly the booths, when my husband and I sat down our knees were practically touching.  There must been a foot and a half between the seats.  I didn't remember the booths being so close together. They must have pushed the booths together to add more tables."}
{"text":"It's a typical restaurant in a mall but the prices are too high and the portions are way too big. I'm a big guy, 6'2, 220lbs and those portions are ridiculous and are probably the reason for the steep prices for a mall restaurant. Cut down the portions and the price! Problem solved.

Overall nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"Great all day breakfast with 3 eggs for 7.99. Added sausages for 1.99 and it was well worth it because they were HUGE. Great coffee too. Schnitzel sandwich was good too according to my wife. Served with sauerkraut, cheese and a large side salad.  Friendly service as always and they go the extra mile to accommodate our kids. Big, clean bathroom! Food came out really fast and seating is ample and comfortable. Great atmosphere for families."}
{"text":"Been eating at El Spero since I was a young kid they are one of the oldest restaurants in Oakville they have been in business for along time close to 50 years. Food is freshly prepared and is home cooked wonderful staff and one of the best places to eat"}
{"text":"This place is Awesome. Ambience is well done with a family atmosphere which is extremely difficult to perform. All day breakfast is available with great lunch type sandwiches. Coffee is not crap (like im hearing it is at Jc's bagels)Dessert is amazing. Go with the coconut creme pie  Wait staff are all extremely friendly. Highly recommended for a date or family get together"}
{"text":"Good vibes, but below average food and ok service. No flavors. Not sure why people write good reviews about such places. Mc D is better than this place. I felt sad after eating which usually not the case with me. We ordered Florentine Benedict, pancakes. 
Home fries with Florentine Benedict were bland, the hollandaise sauce was below average. How can someone go wrong with simple breakfast.  3 thick Pancakes were served. They charged extra for adding blue berries. I didn't have the satisfaction smile so Overall 2 star experience."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place.  Adequate portions, food is always good.  Servers are very nice.  Sunday after church is always busy.  I can see this place being around for another 20 years!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to El Spero and we were pleased to be greeted and seated immediately. The host was very friendly and welcoming. 

Our waitress came over right away and took our drink order. She was also very friendly and welcoming. She delivered our drinks promptly and came right over to take our orders. 

Despite a very busy restaurant, our orders came out within 5 minutes of ordering. The food was hot and the portions were HUGE! 

I had the Canadian omelette which had peameal, about a pound of cheese and mushrooms. There was a generous portion of home fries and it is usually served with thick-cut toast but I ordered it without. 

My husband had the meat lover's breakfast. It had bacon, eggs, large sausages and two slices of ham. It also came with the home fries and toast. 

Our son had a chicken Caesar salad, which was also very large and had a huge amount of chicken on top. It came with a dinner roll. 

The food all tasted very good. The only complaint was from our son who said the chicken was a little dry (but had great flavour). 

The restaurant and washrooms were very clean and well taken care of. The service was excellent. 

We'd definitely return."}
{"text":"We ordered the Salmon Egg Benedict and the featured Lasagna, with a salad as a side. The food overall tasted very cheap though our server was very sweet. Though there is an amicable atmosphere here with quite a few seniors, I would not return for the food and wouldn't go out of my way to recommend to friends."}
{"text":"After reading many positive reviews for this business, I decided to give them a try myself. Walking in, I was confused to if I was at the right entrance - there were two, and the front entrance seemed like it might not be the correct one. No one was around to greet us, as they were getting ready for a baby shower in their semi-private room. We eventually got seated.

Our waitress was not overly friendly, but she wasn't rude either. She took our order in a brisk manner and was off again. I ordered the meat lovers breakfast and my Husband ordered the monte cristo sandwich and potato skins. We both ordered a soft drink and a water.

The potato skins came out first - YUCK! How the heck do you mess up potato skins? But the main problem with the skins was also the most horrific sentence I have ever uttered: \"The bacon is gross.\" THE BACON IS GROSS! No bacon lover should ever have to say such a terrible thing!

We barely touched the skins after that, and after a short wait, our meals arrived. The eggs, toast and ham in my meal were good, though they only gave me one measly jam packet, like it was being rationed or something. Maybe there was a jam shortage or the king had come to collect the jam taxes. But the bacon was, again, just disgusting. It tasted like it had been cooked in very, very, very old oil, as did the sausages. I actually spit the sausage into my napkin and attempted to wipe my tongue with it, getting paper all over my tongue in the process. The paper was preferable.

The only saving grace of our meal was the monte cristo sandwich, which was actually pretty good. Most of my meal sat uneaten, and before we were done eating, I was sick to my stomach. The waitress came by and asked if I'd like a refill on my ginger ale. I said no thank you, and to my utter dismay, she grabbed my half-drank ginger ale and took it to the kitchen, all before I could utter even a whimper or let one single tear gently fall from my eye. For over $2.50 a pop, she could have a least let me finish my badly-needed ginger ale.

Overall, our meal cost $46.00 with tax and before the tip. I was so sick to my stomach from my meal, I told my Husband \"no thanks\" to ever coming to this restaurant again. We took our leftovers home, and my Husband accidentally dumped mine right in front of our apartment door. I didn't mind."}
