{"text":"Love this place! Great drinks ($5 Butler's), good food, friendly staff. Great place for a date or drinks with friends."}
{"text":"I have been to this new location several times: I've found the food & menu very disappointing: the sever couldn't describe & verbalize what was on their menu? I asked several questions re: menu & the answer was I don't know? Really? You would think that servers would possess knowledge of what they're serving: apon my second visit we sat @ a open table: 15mins later we were told it had been reserved so we had to move to a corner seat: yet no reserve card was posted & we weren't notified when we had 1st sat down: very disrespectful: obviously they don't care to entertain middle-aged gay couples: we won't be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"It's a fairly new establishment and have been meaning to go, especially since my in laws live in the condo next door.  I finally went in with hubby, niece and brother.  Had some drinks, nachos and wings on their night menu.  The place is not that big but service was great.  I've seen people do take out."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my experiences at this Firkin.  I have been here twice now and hated the service I received,  the server took forever to speak with us initially and follow up throughout the night.  They said they would look into our request and then ignored us completely.!  You might get better service but for me it's 2 strikes and you are out. Bye firkin on Danforth!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Friday, it was very busy and the server said there would be a wait as we didn't make reservations which was understandable. They have a small kind of lounge area with a couch and some chairs around a table, which is much more comfortable than some other places waiting areas.   We got seated in about 15 minutes and our server was over promptly to take our order. They have a menu expected of a pub; burgers, poutine, fish & chips as well as some salads. I got the Buffalo chicken poutine which was served on a hot skillet. The meal was just as I expected, nothing fancy or amazing but up to par with other pubs I've been too. All in all, its a good place but, I will probably be trying some of the other local places to eat before returning here."}
{"text":"Bartender was great.    Her shots of jameson were perfectly poured.   And a pretty smile."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and used to use this place regularly to watch sports and have a bite and a beer. But then, one day, I went in to catch the first away Toronto FC playoff game of their MLS cup winning run. The bar was nearly empty, but I was told that two people were watching the NFL match (and not even the Bills) and that they only had two cable boxes. To recap : They wouldn't let me watch the hometown team play a playoff game because the only two tables in the place were using BOTH cable boxes to watch a random NFL game.   Also, it's expensive, the food is well below average, the beer selection is all big brewery, and the super anglophile theme is way, way too much. You'd think the anglophile theme would mean they'd put on a soccer match. Nope. They don't even get that right."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with my experience here yesterday. I have been here once before, loved both the food & the customer service & decided to arrange a going away lunch here. The food was pretty good, average, not complaints. But the customer service was horrible! The server had very poor customer service skills, was rude, and did not know how to respond in a kind manner. One of the people having lunch with us called her \"miss\" out of respect as she did not introduce herself when we were seated. She rudely interrupted and said \"My name is ___\". Well it would've been nice if you started off with \" Hi my name is ____, I'll be your server today\" so that we could address you by name. When a complaint was made to the manager & their customer survey was handed back, all he said was \"thank you\", he didn't even bother to apologize. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Well.  Clearly the first review is by someone who either works there or was being paid to shill them.    My wife and I really went there two days after opening.  We were greeted by exceptionally peppy staff.  And observed steadily throughout our meal by concerned management.  It was great to see that level of commitment but a bit uncomfortable.      We found the venue a bit cold and tightly packed.  It seemed as if the design looked good on paper but hadn't been road tested on reality.   It lacked warmth and the proper amount of elbow room.  We noted that while there were many TVs they weren't quite in the right spots to afford a good view from most of the seating areas.    Our server (he was parachuted in for opening week from the Gull location) was amazing.   Extremely personable and right on cue.    The food was ok.   Clearly they worked hard on presentation and timing given it was opening week.  But the quality and originality fell just a bit short.  (We have found that the Firkin menu is a bit wanting at all locations).  It's just a given that you are getting a canned and kind of low end pub experience with the Firkin chain.    We live in the area and we want to support new quality establishments so in spite of not being huge fans of the Firkin experience we returned tonight to give them a second chance.    WELL.  Not so good.   We were seated in this kind of awkward lounge area with a couch.   It was not packed.  And we were pleased with the spot.    We sat for quite a few minutes and no server approached (a fall down in my opinion)  Suddenly the server had a chat with the hostess and seemed to be pointing our way - perhaps she wasn't pleased that two people were seated in this weird area designed to hold more people if necessary.   The hostess came over to us and said she had made a mistake and that the area was reserved and would we mind moving.   Since the rest of the tables are so tightly packed, we decided we would prefer not to move.  I suppose mistakes do happen but the hostess should know about reservations and perhaps there should be Reserved placards in use.    Suffice to say we opted to just leave the whole place behind and find another pub with a more cozy and comfortable vibe.     And now here we sit...very happy...at An Sibin Pub down at broadview and queen.   We are going back to our original position on Firkin.  Too bad.  We really wanted to like the new one on danforth.     Mediocre food.  And atrocious service.     UPDATE  Ok almost a bit embarrassed to say that since first review we've been back here twice more.  It's local.  What can I say?  But each time.  It just falls flat.    Last visit.  Order was wrong.  Asked them t correct.  They took away whole meal, fixed the part that was wrong.  Then brought back the whole dish.  The other part was now really soggy.   And what's worse.  When I took a bite.   It was wrong too!!!  Service was terrible.  Made excuses instead of accepting the blame.  But hey don't be quick to blame the servers overall.  It starts at the top.   Either the manager or the district GM is to blame here.  For sure.  Service is just so uncustomer friendly.   Manager even came out - clearly heard from staff and then went into hiding.  Lame o.   Totally lame o.  It's Like they don't actually like their clients.    Sigh.    Hate to admit it.  But we may actually go back.  It's local!!!   It really does suck though.  Food is really not terrible.  Venue is not terrible.  It's just that the service takes a decent enough experience and makes it seem WORSE than it really was.  End up feeling totally ripped off every time.     Firkin on danforth.   Come on!  Get a good manager in there!  Meh."}
{"text":"Well, this was an experience today for lunch. A new experience. Yikes. Fish and chips were okay but tasted like frozen fish, certainly not battered fish. For an English pub, I would expect battered fish. But I ate it. For $9.00, I would expect more than 12 french fries though.   My friend ordered a steak with sweet potato fries. Burnt. Mentioned it to waitress. She happily took it back to the kitchen because she saw they were burnt too. She came back 30 seconds later, in tears, saying that the kitchen staff yelled at her. Wtf???  Then she put the plate back on the table, with the burnt sweet potato fries...we both sat there scratching our heads. No one was apparently going to do anything about this so we decided to bring the plate up to the bar. Fella behind bar was helpful. Made friend move now cold sweet potato fries onto separate plate and he brought them back to the kitchen. New fries came to our table a few minutes later. Not Burnt. But now both our lunches were getting colder and colder.   Overall, very slow service, even when place was empty.   Overcharged for more expensive steak and overcharged (double??) on soft drink.   Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a burger and after realizing lunch options are quite limited in the area, we settled on this little \"gem\". It's apparently a chain, which should have been my first clue.  So we wanted the burger , and who doesn't want some fries or a salad  with that? You do, you say? Well, get ready to pony up some more cash  because sides are extra . And when I asked my server what type of fries they serve, she gave me an odd ? like somehow I'm weird for asking about fries...  The burger arrived with fries and they were burnt . \"Your fries came out burnt, but I can get you new ones, if you want\"  like she's doing me some huge favour!! You can? I don't have to pay and eat for this burnt shit?! ... is what I wanted to say, but settled on \"Yes, new fries sound great. Thank you.\" You know, cause manners.  Next I got to eat a nice looking burger that was unfortunately way too dry and tasteless . If it could only taste half as good as it looked   I thought my fresh margarita would be a no brainer but when you raise your expectations just a little, this place is sure to fall flat.  Overall, this place left me at a seriously Kevin Sorbo level of DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly.  the decor is clean and modern. Feels like a nice night out, like you have arrived at a special place.  the lighting is perfect!  Food is well plated and tasty but tonight it's pints and great conversation on the menu!"}
{"text":"If you like good food or good service, then this is NOT the place for you.  Busy night because of Raptors playoff game - but there is just no excuse for the awful service and equally-horrible food.  Server made us feel unwelcome from the moment we sat down.  I decided on the wings - $10 for one pound.  Worst wings I have EVER seen - TINY, dry and likely re-fried (more than once). They looked like dead claws from meat found at the side of the road.   When we asked our server about them, she blamed kitchen and there was no option to choose something else from the menu.  When I asked for some barbecue sauce from the server because the wings were so dry, she said she'd have to charge me for it. I was handed a bottle of Tabasco sauce to try and make up for it.  Without a doubt THE WORST wings I have ever come across, combined with a server that made us feel like absolute SHIT. She ruined our rare night out together as friends with her complete rudeness and lack of care or attention.  DO NOT RECOMMEND. EVER. I will never go back."}
{"text":"It was the okayest of okay meals. Went for brunch and ordered the full English brekkie. Egg yolks were overcooked and I wish they served proper breakfast sausage as opposed to the beer brat. My friend had the French toast though, which was pretty tasty.   Not a bad neighbourhood spot. Good for a \"close to home, need coffee asap, just wanna eat\" hangover brunch."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location. This is a new location and I love the atmosphere and decor. We had to seat ourselves, I'm not sure if this is a normal thing or not.  But anyways, I had the Basa fish tacos which were delicious and my boyfriend had the Brown Butter Basa with fries which he also enjoyed (surprisingly because he's extremely picky).   Service and wait time for our food was average, nothing special.   I really liked this location and I'd come here again!"}
{"text":"A name that implies \"Pub\" still means something in Ontario- English style meals, variety of beer on tap, comfortable seating and a slightly noisy but genial atmosphere and wait staff. So, be warned, this place, although part of the pub chain that shares the name Firkin, is NO pub. Instead it is a breezy, concrete family restaurant with picnic benches (huh?), jarring music and friendly but impersonal service (their default is being way too friendly).   As part of a franchise/chain the food is identical to others, but mediocre at best. Following the American model, dishes now bear names like \"slider\" but I saw no \"grinder\". A smaller space to the right will be a sanctuary, the lager open area at the front door reveals its true identity: sports bar (not a pub)."}
{"text":"Come here with some friends for a meal and some drinks. This will probably be the last time I come here. The mixed drinks we ordered were not good and the food I ordered was mediocre. On top of all that the service was horrible."}
{"text":"My friend had to go into the office for a few hours and needed me to occupy his dad for a while. So I picked this place knowing that it's a decent chain and was close to to where we needed to be.  We came in on a Friday for lunch and a few beers. There were a few other tables occupied but it wasn't overly busy. Parking was a little difficult because the street was torn up outside so there wasn't anything curbside within a couple of blocks.   I find their beer selection a little wanting. They have a good range of styles, but there isn't a ton options on tap. For food I just went with nachos. They were pretty standard. A good size for the price. This location is relatively new so it's definitely nicer than some of the Firkins I've been to in the past."}
{"text":"I've given this place a couple of chances but it does not impress me. The service is actually pretty decent, but the bar loses points on 1) poor beer selection (all big breweries, no local representation other than Steam Whistle) and 2) poor food quality. No matter what I ordered, the food was pretty mediocre. I realize that this is a regular pub and adjusted my expectations accordingly, but it was pretty disappointing. I would not bring friends here for dinner but if you just want a drink and some pub snacks, it will do. Other than that, there are better pubs in the immediate area."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this pub! It doesn't have the cozy feeling of some of their other locations but I used it as my foodie headquarters when I was in Toronto. I ate there three different times and always had good service and pretty good food. There were no complaints from anyone while I was there and wow, their chicken and waffles eggs benny is quite out of this world.   My only complaint is that it can be very loud which was hard on my dad when we met there for brunch. Nothing like Axl Rose screaming into our ears as we tried to catch up.  They take reservations, have lots of natural light during the daytime (great for photos) and because it is so large can handle a big party. You can find a more complete review of my blog. ~ Suzie the Foodie"}
{"text":"Definitely better than the first time I went in the autumn. That would have needed a goose to get a one-star  rating.    Seems like the menu and kitchen staff has been improved  since that visit.  The service (Sylvie) was very good.  I'm still a bit puzzled why they call something served on a mini-naan a taco, but it must be that 'British-theme thing. It tasted fine but wasn't what I'd expected.   My big bacon sammie was very good.  All the components were excellent, and they worked together well.  The accompanying side salad was a miss.  Not horrible, but grocery store salads are more interesting.   The atmosphere isn't particularly pub-like but it's bright and pleasant.    I'd like to see them give the menu another tweak so I could give them a solid 4.  It would be a nice place to go with family/friends.   The only thing really off-putting in the whole experience was in the washroom - where the video ad screen faces you as you're on the  loo.   My luck was to get the Fido ad with the fellow sitting on his sofa - facing me .  I've got a dog, I understand being watched but this ... so wrong.   Raise the screen/move it ... something ... those moments were just soooo awkward."}
{"text":"I came here after work on Opening night with my wife and the place seems fantastic. The staff are super friendly, the food was delicious (ok it was just a burger but it was cooked right and juicy) with cheese and bacon, fries on the side chased by a pint of beer. The atmosphere is what you'd expect from a Firkin pub, clean and modern with the right \"British\" accents. Although I'm not in a position to require wheelchair access, this place seems to be wheelchair accessible, which is great seeing that Woodbine subway station will eventually (soon) have an elevator and be an accessible station - situated super close to this bar. Bonus points (although I think businesses are legislated now to be 'accessible).   Aside from a pretty awesome atmosphere, tasty food, a nice selection of beer and drinks, and friendly staff, I'll end with the seating arrangements...  There are an eclectic arrangement of seats. You have two cozy little corners on either side of the front entrance with individual seats (almost cafe like seating) surrounding a small table/chest. Looked like each corner could sit around 6 bodies give or take.  There are seats surrounding the bar (normal and good). There's an adequate sized not-in-your-face TV at the bar as well.  There is a larger more private room with seats that is just down a few steps to the right of the front entrance. Seems like a good place for a large party. This has large (seems like 4-6 seating) tables. Cafeteria style but cooler.  There are also normal tables (high) with high chairs where we sat. Thankfully the tables had foot rests, and it was comfortable.  So there you go. I'll be back since I live in the area, and I think you should check it out and see for yourself. Cheers."}
{"text":"Utter disappointment. Apparently being a regular and spending lots of money every night we come out isn't worth much in the face of a couple of random guests spending $20 to watch the first raptors game of the season (they have 82 games in total). My husband and I were looking forward to watching a major game of football (only 14) but were pretty much forced to leave in the middle of our meal after buying a pitcher, some cocktails and dinner. We were all set to enjoy a nice evening here and we were told that we couldn't watch it after we arrived an hour early and were told the game would be on.   A note to management, choose your customers better. You've lost customers that spend regularly in favour of a couple of one timers who will likely not spend more than a few dollars and likely won't return.   An example of poor management at its finest. We will not be coming back.  Regards, Redskins fans"}
{"text":"I was here with a friend on November 28th and my friend and I ordered the calimari off their pub menu. Honestly, this was the worst calimari we both had in our lives. I know its deep fried, but grease was literally dripping off them. We returned them and order the nachos instead which were better. We paid our bill and we left. However when I got home I realized the server still charged me for the calimari. I called the restaurant next day and was told by someone that I would have to bring my bill back. I live at Spadina and Front, so basically it would be a waste of time for me to go back for $13.00. Dishonesty is not a good a good business policy. The server should have refunded the calimari instead of leaving it on the bill, I definitely won't be back here..."}
{"text":"My wife and I really try hard to like this place and have visited at least once a month since it opened. It's super close, prices reasonable, decent menu options with good kid choices, and it has this oddly perfect area for young families away from the main bar.  However the service is such a lottery, swinging from one extreme to the next. It can be great - big shout out to Alex who is always super attentive, calm and friendly.  Unfortunately our most recent experience was at the other end of the spectrum. Made worse given it was my wife's birthday and her parents wanted to treat us all. From the outset our sever made us feel unwelcome, even though her manner picked up near the end as the bill (and tip time) approached.  Come on Firkin, please sort it!"}
