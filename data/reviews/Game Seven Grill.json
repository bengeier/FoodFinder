{"text":"Quite good, and across from the ballpark so easy access to the game after dining or getting a quick bite or drink before the game.  Portions are large and quite tasty and the noise level is high.  Only disappointment was reserving a seat meant next to the bar.  My husband dislikes the \"tall chairs\" we asked for a lower table but was told that's what we reserved; not what I had in mind when I made the reservation."}
{"text":"Pros: Right next to Chase, they have beer.

Cons: Atmosphere is super lame, not as hip as Slider's was. It's more like going to a Chili's rather than a cool sports bar, hard to get pumped for the game there. The beer selection is limited, that's fine I usually drink domestics at sporting events. Wont find a IPA or a STOUT here though.  Staff is friendly but lacking enthusiasm. The old school Slider's Shot Girls and Beer Girls were much quicker and easier to order from (no waiting for you drink to arrive). Live music is okay but might be better post-game. The crowd seems to respond better to newer music to get pumped/ excited.  Food is fine, I had the nachoes there once, a lil' over priced but that's cause of the location. I save my money for $1.50 dogs inside Chase.

my summary: I would give GAME 7 one star but the fact that it's close to the Field and they serve beer is the only thing saving them. BRING BACK SLIDER'S"}
{"text":"I noticed that there were a few positive reviews towards the end.They must be paid shills. This place is now so different than before with the rules of \"you can't sit here and just order drinks outside in the hot sun unless you have a food order\"
And then they have all these military style thugs breathing down your neck all the time. They must have a lot of people leave without paying.I never ordered from this despicable crappy place because I hate the atmosphere. Very few people go in there anymore because it is so Nazi."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after looking at the menu online and watching the clip about it during a Dbacks game onTV.  Will not go back!

FIrst off, there is little seating unless you have a RESERVATION!  Many available tables to the left of the entrance for reservations, but for folks without a reservation tables were to the right side.  Our choices were inside where there was a bar and about 15 tables (all full) , or outside where there were about 5 tables and some red picnic tables lined up.  

The picnic tables were so close together some were difficult to get between and were filthy!  Plus, the red seemed to rub off on clothes and shoes.

Now we could deal with all that seeing as the place is right outside the stadium.  So we found a table and tried to order food.  We had to ask around to find how to do that- then be self-sufficient in the process!  We had to go to the hostess station for a menu, and then go inside to the bar to order and pay.  They did ask where we were sitting, brought it out when it was done and waiters appeared once the order was up to bring the food and condiments.  Food was just OK- 

The real kicker for us was that the prices on the menu for food and beer were not what  we were charged.  Our hamburger was listed at 10.95 but we were charged 11.95- not a huge difference but still annoying.

The real difference came in the beer.  Beers listed on the menu as $5-$6 were actually $7-$8 when you got them!  Again not a big deal seeing as we were so close to the stadium, but still annoying.  Why print a menu price if it's not correct???

If the tables had been clean, the place more organized, and the menu pricing reflecting the actual prices- the whole experience would have been different for us.  
The place is convenient if you are meeting someone before a game, but I can honestly say we will not be returning!"}
{"text":"We came in after the Padres game a few weeks ago because my buddy wanted to do the wing contest......epic fail!!! Those wings are soooo hott!!! We split a regular order of wings, pulled pork sliders and a burger, the food was great!! Service was excellenct and the beers were ice cold!! This is one of the better sports bars in the downtown area and i would give them 5 stars if they were open ALL THE TIME, and not just gameday!"}
{"text":"The service was slower than slow. It took 50 minutes to arrive. Food was crap. Not worth what they charged for it. If you want to get into Chase Stadium at a decent time do NOT stop here first."}
{"text":"We came here for the Diamondbacks Home Opener. It was packed, which we expected and they did a wonderful job 5 stars getting us a table for four. We sat inside and did not have the option to sit on their huge outdoor patio.We ordered and were served cocktails immediately. Surprisingly, after 5 minutes the waiter took our food order - we expected much longer because it was packed. My husband ordered the G7 Burger and I ordered the Moonshine salad - our friends both ordered the wings. After 35 minutes we finally were served. My husbands burger was suppose to have pepperjack cheese but did not have any cheese. No condiments were offered and his fries were rubbery and cold. So he ate a burger without cheese or condiments. He didn't eat more than 3 or 4 fries. My salad was huge and fresh but the chicken and bacon were missing. It was good for a 'Garden Salad' but that was not what I ordered. Our friends loved the chicken wings but the lack of napkins disappointed them. Drinks were only refilled once. I think on our next visit to a Diamondbacks game we'll take the advice of other patrons and visit a restuarant many blocks away from the stadium."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The waitress had no idea what she is doing. Food is just as bad. There is tons of better place near by. Do yourself a favor. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place. I'm glad I did but not sure if I'd go back. Had to go fetch my own beer from the bar because the waiter saw a beer can on the table and assumed it wasn't empty. The food was...eh, ok. The Redneck Tacos sounded good but didn't taste as good as it sounded. The slaw was soured and not edible. The wings were average at best. Just disappointed."}
{"text":"this place was HORRIBLE... we got a burger and they ASKED if we wanted ketchup..it arrived 5 minutes later..as we were leaving a couple was having the same issue...if u are going to offer burgers on the menu, ketchup should be automatic..we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at the start of the game. I ended up having to work and had to pull out my laptop and I wasn't ready to make my way into the park. My server was outstanding and got helped with my every request. At the time I visited, the menu was limited, and there weren't too many options. I selected the nachos fries, which were fine but I would have preferred a meal. I can see how this is a great place to hang out pre- and post-game but it's pretty slow once the game starts."}
{"text":"We attended a Dbacks game and needed to catch a bite to eat since we were hours early to the field. Game seven was closest so we went in. We were seating promptly since the Restaurant was pretty much empty. Our servers name was Carlos and he seemed friendly enough. Most of their food had really sweet barbecue sauce but it was edible. Within an hour the restaurant pretty much filled up. Our server forgot about us and treated us like an inconvenience for ordering drinks, which he kept forgetting to bring.

We decided to move outside to the patio so we didn't have to sit at the table any longer. We split the bill and one of us was charged with the whole thing so they got paid twice. We brought this to the servers attention. He reran the card but when our card cleared we were still charged the full amount. That was a week ago.

Since then I have contacted the restaurant multiple times. I finally spoke with the male manager whom informed me that it wasn't his job and I would have to contact accounting.  He didn't take down any of my info he just gave me another number to a lady that wouldn't be in the office for another five days. 

Since I have been playing phone tag with her. I am still waiting for someone to take my info and I can't get my money back. DON'T eat here... Unless you like crappy service, crappy management, and crappy accounting!!! This is the service industry! I would expect to be treated with some hospitality!!!"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience it was coming here before our game. I wish I could give it less then one star. They do not offer any vegetarian food, everything is loaded down with meat. Not every baseball fan eats meat. The female bartender working at 12:20 pm on Wednesday afternoon was rude. She got the order wrong twice and never stuck around to be helpful enough to receive a tip. Won't ever be back. This place is a joke of overpriced waste."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great for pre-game beers. I would have given higher marks but I'm not impressed with the food. Friends ordered nachos. They're not bad but they use Cheese Whiz. Some people like that processed crap but I don't. Soooo, beware. I ordered the \"brisket\" quesadilla. I put it in \" \" because there wasn't much meat. I couldn't tell if I was eating bacon bits or \"brisket\". The quesadilla was very gooey, and not in a good way. The tortilla was soft and soggy. I wish the cook had left it on the burner longer. I'm not sure what the sauce mix is, it cones on the side. The server didn't know either. I suggest asking for their BBQ sauce. They offer 3 different kinds. 

Overall, cheaper beers then inside the stadium. Good pre-game atmosphere. Food is just ok."}
{"text":"Very poor service.  Food was just ok.

Came here before a Diamondbacks game to eat because it was close. Hostess stand did a good job managing us. Communicated well and got us seated. 

Waitress didn't seem to know our table number. Took our order, stopped by about 10 minutes after she took our order and said she wanted to out it in the system correctly ( we were hoping our food and drinks would come about then).  

Food and drinks came at the same time.  Waitress said she would refill my wife's water, but never did. She buzzed past saying she would get us our bill

Had to flag her down and give her my card because the bill never came. She reviewed what we ordered because she thought the table number was wrong. Sigh. Didn't she do that before?

We have now waited another 10 minutes for our check. We will miss the start of the game. 

I dread seeing the bill. It will likely be wrong."}
{"text":"Game Seven Grill is a great place to hang out and grab a drink after visiting Chase Field! 

I ended up at Game Seven Grill after an event at neighboring Chase Field and walked into a Casino themed private party. The bar itself is quite large and Game Seven also offers a gigantic outdoor deck that had a live DJ when I visited. The beer options seem to be the same as what Chase Field offered and the prices seemed to be similar as well so you will shell out a bit to get your drink on ($8.00), but considering its locale that is to be expected. 

Game Seven Grill gets 3 Stars worth of funk."}
{"text":"Don't usually go to the bars around the ballpark.  I have never been impressed with the food or prices. 

But we found ourselves at the ballpark early last weekend. And decided to go in at least to get out of the heat. 

I found they have a nice selection of beers on tap including a favorite Cider that I enjoy.  They also had a nice selection of appetizers.  Theme of the menu revolved around pulled pork items along with the normal burgers and sandwiches. 

We had the potato skins with pulled pork and a couple of drinks.  Was very pleased as it started the day off. 

Will consider this location again for full meal alternatives before game time!!"}
{"text":"Waste of bar space. Every TV behind the bar was set to a slideshow of the DBacks logo then their lineup. Definitely needs a big change. Coach's corner is smaller, but a lot better. They show baseball games on their TVs"}
{"text":"Was excited to try the new menu at \"Game 7\".  4 of us got there at 11:15 for a 1:05 game on a Sunday.....  Restaurant was definately NOT full.  A hostess sat us and did not leave menu's. The manager/general manager (short haired guy running around with NO customer service skills) almost threw us out because we were sitting without menus in front of us and thought we \"snuck\" in.  I pointed to the front hostess stand and explained he should be talking to the hostess instead of making my group feel like criminals for sitting there. We were hungry otherwise that would of been the end of that.
     The  tables that were available were outside... We started with a table in the shade, but after a 1:45 minute meal we were in DIRECT sunlight. by the end....Umbrellas would have been a nice touch...especially in AZ. 
    The people at the BENCH next to us had an issue with the red bench paint transferring to their clothes.  This same manager explained that he does not MAKE the benches, he runs a restaurant.  Our table, their table and other tables in earshot could not believe the explanation he was giving them. To his credit he discounted their bill, but definitely made an uncomfortable situation worse.......AGAIN
   All business' have problems.  It is how a business HANDLES the problems.  This manager , face of the business, better have his days numbered as the food was not bad. 
    There will always be one extra table available IF you go to this place as I will not be back...Thank the management for that......"}
{"text":"As many people probably do, we stopped here before a Reds vs Diamondbacks baseball game. My brother and I originally rolled over to the patio by the bar and grabbed a drink and sat down. Live music? Cool. Sitting down it as loud as fawk! We moved over to the other side and waited on friends to come. Our friends came and it took forever for a server to come over. I know they are busy, and we were way early specifically there to drink before going in... so no big deal... still a bit annoying though.

Once served, she came around more often. Good! We were thirsty! Food was good. I woofed it all down, plus some of my brother's nachos."}
{"text":"Horrible experience on multiple occasions. Don't go here post or prior game. They will serve you and kick you out because they are closing exactly one hour after game.  They will also try to take more cash for their tip going you will not realize. Tried to take $20 tip on a$77 bill. Never again,  rude staff as well."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner before a Diamondbacks game. I expect it to be busy but 45 minutes for one cheeseburger, which wasn't even our correct order is a little much. The coleslaw was not edible, oh and they forgot to bring it to us with the order. When we complained, we were told they are busy and only got 20% off. I will walk (with my currently broken leg) somewhere else to never go here again."}
{"text":"Very crowded with all my fellow Yankees fans drinking a cold one pregame. The fact that this place has two wells outside serving beer is the saving grace. Two other bars (Alice and Dugout) were impossible to enter and even if you got inside, getting a beer was difficult. At this bar, they had beer stations on opposite sides on the patio and getting a brew was easy and quick. Once the Yankees leave, it will be even easier. Got a cold Miller Lite Bottle and a  Corona for 11 bucks and right into the stadium. Good stuff."}
{"text":"This place is basically a concession stand . 

We came in yesterday before the game . We went to the smaller bar and waited over 10 mins to get the bartender to serve us . So we walked over the the larger bar instead in hopes to get a drink . We did,  but my husband did not get Grand Marnier.. It was a clear liquor. We told  him it was not correct and he was puzzled ( grand Marnier is a orange color ) He went and got a new bottle from the back . 

The bottle looked old . They clearly refill this bottle . It's not the bartenders fault , but as a bartender you should know what color your liquors are lol ! And owners /management should stay in the same color scheme when being shady !! 

The bartender called over his manager . The manager dumped out the clear liquor but didn't throw away the bottle . So again , this just means they plan to do this again and again . Sad .

A quick drink before heading to the game seems like a great idea , but we not be returning . I wanna know my drinks are real and we are not getting ripped off ."}
{"text":"Very slow and the food was ok. Kind of overpriced for what they had. The menu was also very limited. Don't come with kids."}
{"text":"Nice little bar next to the baseball stadium in Phoenix. I stopped in here to have a beer before the game and was seated immediately. It got pretty busy and noisy inside and some people were standing right behind me talking quite loudly. Otherwise, service was fast and speedy despite the crowd. Got a nice cider in a glass for $5 and savored it down."}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes for a waitress to arrive after being sat at our table. Waitress could not tell us what was on tap or provide a list of available beers. Took another 15 minutes for our drinks to be served. Specifically asked for lemons and lime wedges which never came. Waitress never asked if we wanted food. Waitress left an empty serving tray at our table for about 10 minutes. Very unimpressed."}
{"text":"Ordered my food an hour before the game. Got it 5 minutes before the game. Couldn't find my waitress to cancel my order or pay my tab. Terrible."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. The only positive is the server was kind. Other than that, it's terrible. Sure, some may say \"it's opening day, they were slammed\" unfortunately that is not the case. It's pretty dead upstairs and there is plenty of room downstairs. We waited 10 minutes for someone to come and serve us, we waited 25 minutes for ONE order of nachos and they came out completely cold. On top of that, it took another ten for drinks. 

Im giving an extra star from my original one star because the resolution was swift, they were kind and apologetic. 

The hostess was very helpful in the resolution as well"}
{"text":"Hottest seemed lost and unsure of what to do.  They weren't even busy and our food took forever.  Server was rude as well but my food was good and the beer was cold.  I'm sure it's a good place after a game if you are drinking."}
{"text":"Not impressed.
Sat at the bar to wait for the rest of the gang to show up for the Dodgers vs diamondbacks game.
2 drinks and a quesadilla appetizer ended up 25 bucks.
Bartender l female was not very welcoming or nice.
It was busy so just really trying to churn the crowd it seemed.
Bbq quesadilla was dry but came with salsa. 
Probably better to just sit outside and grab your own beer from the little tent.

Glad we didn't grab a full table and have a meal.
It is convenient that it's on property of the stadium bit that's about it."}
{"text":"In for a Bloody Mary before the baseball game. Staff is very friendly. Price was a surprise at 6.50. Food looked good, but, will eat later. Close to the ballpark. Nice place  to sit waiting for the gates to open.


Chef Joe surprised me with a quesadilla. Well done and thank you. Anthony my bartender has made me feel at home."}
{"text":"Came here with family after D Back game. Worst customer service ever. Didn't greet you or say hi. Didn't give us a menu or ask if we wanted drinks. Sat ourselves down and waited for someone to come over. There was only but maybe 10 people in here may I add. Finally after waiting 15 minutes did someone come over and asked us if we wanted something to drink. Bartender with Arizona hat on saw us and said nothing either to us. Server finally brought us our drinks and asked us if we were ready to order. Told her we didn't have a menu. She stated that's it right there in front of you with literally just wings and pizza on it. Completely disappointed in this place. The owner should be ashamed of his staff here. How there in business makes me wonder. Would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Will not return...ordered 2 small side salads...pork sandwich with fries...quesadilla with brisket...received one salad and one hamburger and quesadilla...what the heck...didn't take too long to get rest of food....don't think quesadilla had any brisket...a small scoop of coleslaw was with pork sandwich..what was that all about ...two stars only because the draft beer was cold and sauces on table were good...had to ask for dressing for salad..Doesn't a server..waitress check order slips when they pick up food...too many other places to enjoy before DBacks game...plus we felt prices high for what you get."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and great drinks.  

The manager Reggie was very accommodating to our large party.  He made sure we were happy  

I'll definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Had the opportunity to get there an hour before the game yesterday. Thought riding 45 min prior to first pitch we would be able to grab some wings. We missed first pitch by 10min. 
Also left sunglasses at the table which was bussed immediately after (we stuck around and watched the rest of the first on tv so i saw it get busses) yet glasses were gone. Would not recommend this place to anyone and I've been going there for the last 5 seasons due to proximity. Games seven lost me and my families business."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Will have to go to a better bar before attending any games."}
{"text":"I love a well placed, fun sports bar to go to before the game that day. When its well run, there is nothing better. When its poorly managed, it has \"Meh\" written all over it. Lets turn double play and discuss Game Seven:

~Fud/Drink~
I must admit, I did not try food when I went. Reason being, it was pretty expensive, and I had already stretched the ol' budget for the tickets I got. I saw some people's items, and yes it does beat what you get in the stadium, but just by a little. Quality is that of a normal sports bar. I have seen much better. As for drinks, wow, so priced up. I get it, I do. They have to to make ends meet. But seriously, $6.50 for a pint? Plus, its just general across the board, so from Stella to Budweiser....its $6.50. It once again beats inside, but why bother? There is a place right down the corner that is about half this price.....hmm I wonder where...read on...

~Atmosphere/Service~
Just like the old Sliders here, nothing much has changed. Its a nice wide open space with two levels to choose from. The outdoor patio is inviting, even in hot weather there are misters and a good amount of room to bring a group of friends. There is not much ambiance to the place, the bar area itself is wide open with a couple TV's and long bar. Not an abundance of flare or items on walls. As for service, I can only attest to the barkeeps. They were very attentive, although I went very early to the game and was one of the few there...it wasn't hard to serve me. Each of the individuals I worked with were talkative and fun, and were prompt when I asked to close out.


Extras/Rating~
Two stars are provided for location to ballpark and friendly service. I truly feel that this is place is a trap for out-of-towners. They  come to see their team and did not check it out in advance or ask the motel/hotel where to go pre-game. I went for the Orioles series, and at the first game, there was a sea of orange here. The next game, they all realized to go to another location...I did as well. For better deals, including HAPPY HOUR PRICES, go to Coach's Corner, just a stone's throw away on Jefferson. Prices for food and drinks are much cheaper, along with comparable service. I rarely shout out another business on a review, but seriously, do not waste your money for beer, it makes no sense. I see redeeming factors if you have a super large group of friends wanting a quick beer or two before/after the game. Besides that, skip Game Seven Grill and choose from a ton of other bars in the area."}
{"text":"Seated quickly before the game, is the only reason I am giving this place one star.  I ordered the veggie flatbread and my boyfriend ordered the bratwurst and fries. They brought out the bratwurst and a salad so we thought it was the wrong table but the waitress came and tried to ask why we rejected it, then said oh they got the order wrong so your flatbread will be a few mins. They brought out the CHICKEN flatbread, so I just accepted so I wouldn't have to wait longer. Good thing I am not a vegetarian or a picky eater. Bratwurst and fries were horrible. Fries were not cooked. We decided to order some drinks before we left so I asked the waitress what their well vodka was, she replied Tito's. I was shocked and said really? She said yes. Ok cool ya we will take that. Then came back and said sorry our well is svedka so I just put that in for you. Nevermind maybe I wanted a better vodka. Then we received the check folder and it had a nasty blob of jizz in it. Never received any apology of any kind. The wait staff seems oblivious. The patio is cool though. To drink."}
{"text":"Came here during Dbacks Fan Fest not just for the DBacks Alumni Players signing that was happening on the restaurant's corridor, but also to visit friends who were there and grab a bite to eat during a break int he action of Fan Fest. Well, come to find out they closed the kitchen so I wasn't able to get anything to eat. I was majorly disappointed...that's a BIG fail in my book! 

Looking over their menu ahead of time, about the only reasonably priced item I saw was their salad, I believe a grilled chicken one if I recall...the rest of the items were rather pricey, and from seeing what friends of mine have ordered in the past, they definitely give you your money's worth and then some, but yeah, I wouldn't make this place an everyday stop for food.

I would like to be able to TRY it sometime,, however, so I can give it a \"second chance\" and see if my star ratings will go up or not."}
{"text":"I've only visited here before games for drinks so I can't comment on the food just yet... it's a little pricey for me.  Some days, I am perfectly content with settling for a dirty dollar hot dog in the ballpark.  That's what baseball games are for.  

Game Seven is always packed... be ready to make some new friends; the bar is super crowded before the first pitch.  All of the vodka sodas I've had here... mehh, they seem pretty weak... they have a nice selection on tap so I am a fan of that.

I love that they have other baseball games playing at the bar... I guess you'd expect that from a sports grill.  And I love all of the dbacks memorabilia.  That makes me happy.  They usually have live music playing before the games.  Great place to sit & people watch before the game... probably the most entertaining thing about this place.

All in all, good place to have a beer before the game."}
{"text":"The service was disappointing, but the food was tasty. When we needed a drink re-made from the bar, the bartender argued that it was made correctly and offered to make another one, but we would have to buy the second drink as well. 
The feel of the restaurant is that they're running on a shoestring, tenuous budget, and it shows in the service and the setails"}
{"text":"Stopped here before the Diamondbacks game the other night.  Our waitress was nice enough, but we had to wait a pretty long time just for an appetizer.  We had the chicken nachos and thought they were really good.  I would definitely get them again!  Beer was served in small, plastic cups which my husband wasn't a fan of."}
{"text":"No. Just...no.
Joke of a menu, bad food, bad service, bad atmosphere, overpriced. 

My husband and I came here for dinner and a beer before the game, and it was the worst. The service was timely enough, but the server couldn't answer any of our questions. I asked if the Schreiner's sausage was served whole, like a hot dog, or shaved on a hamburger bun. \"I'm not sure, sorry.\" Okay.... We also asked if they had XX Lager or amber, and she said amber. I thought it was weird because the lager is so common, but dismissed it...until I saw someone walk away from the bar with a lager. Then, when she came back to take our order, the busser walked by and she flat out interrupted my husband in order to tell the busser something, to which he replied that the lady at another table needed a refill. It was...awkward. Especially because the restaurant wasn't even busy! In keeping with the theme, our server came and dropped the check, picked it up, and brought it back without ever speaking a word to us. 

So, anyway, I got nachos ($12?!). The chicken that came on them was like rubber, and in huge long pieces that needed to be cut to fit into a bite. Nachos are not a fork and knife friendly food. The cheese sauce was gross and the chips were hard, and the sour cream was a laughable little squeeze. My husband got the 3 pulled pork sliders ($10), which came without sauce which is weird, and on dry bland buns. The fries were okay. We left well over half our food untouched. It's a disappointing way to waste $40, especially when there are so many great places close by.

I would only suggest coming here for a drink before the game if everywhere else is packed and you MUST be right by the gates."}
{"text":"Don't make the mistake of being drawn in by the close proximity or outside scenery to Chase Field if you're looking for good service or food like we did. Our food (2 pulled pork sandwiches and 1 brisket sandwich) took 45 minutes to arrive at our table after ordering. Besides the food being mediocre, the waitress wasn't very attentive to our needs and told us she didn't even want to live in Pheonix anymore, which probably attributed to her lack of caring. There was a short wait because it was an hour and a half before the game started which we understood. After the hostesses finally put their cell phones down and decided to help seat us, they informed us of an upstairs bar and seating that had no wait. It wasn't until we got up there that they told us it was a limited menu (which was fine.. we had a beer while we waited for another table downstairs).. But why bother having all that space if you aren't going to serve a full menu?? The bartenders shared their displeasure, as I probably would too, because of the potential sales/money they were losing out on by serving a VERY small portion of the menu. We felt bad for them because they were very nice and attentive and deserved better. I didn't mention that we had a member of our party who is disabled on crutches before they led us on the journey upstairs. I would never eat here again but it might be a decent pre-game drinking environment on the patio before the game. Maybe next visit.. until then, I'll stick to Padres games in SoCal! This place should take some notes."}
{"text":"Staff is horrible. Got an eye roll from the bartender when I ordered iced tea. Actually, it was more of a snarl. Got a highball glass full of ice with about 3 ounces of tea. We got moved from a corner where we weren't in anyone's way to a through way where tons of people needed to get by. 1st and last time I go in there!"}
{"text":"We came here for a few drinks before a diamondbacks matinee. The drinks are reasonably priced for the most part and the staff was very friendly. We did not order any food though so I can not review that aspect of this restaurant ."}
{"text":"Stopped in with friends before watching the Dbacks lose another game. The restaurant setting is fitting for the area and has a lot of television viewing options for sports fans. The food and drink options were adequate and I would have to say that the food was better than I was expecting for a sporting environment. I had the beer battered brisket fritters and tried my friend's venom wings. One perk to yelping is getting to eat others food. :) The fritters were very good and I would recommend them. Venom wings on the other hand lacked any bite but were flavorful.  A fellow friend did arrive a bit later and attempted to finish their XXX Hottest Wings and failed. He did give a valiant effort but was only able to finish 3 of 8. I have no idea how his wings tasted given this guys stomach would have lasted all of one bite. The smell of death was enough for me. Only real issue for me was the service. As others have mentioned, the time to get food and drinks was very slow. We regularly had to flag staff down to get drinks. They were all friendly enough, just slow for pregame food and drinks. Would give the place another shot given those fritters:)"}
{"text":"I miss Sliders.  You walk in here and \"the right side of the restaurant is open seating, but you can't order from the menu\"  the left side of the restaurant is for seating and eating??  Annoying. 

This is not the same \"Pre-game\" spot it used to be.  $16.00 for a hamburger?  Served in a metal \"tub\"?  

I opted for the Brisket Sandwich and the brisket was beyond over cooked and DRY!  I mean it was chewy and tough.  The fries were soggy and not good at all.  

My friend ordered the pulled pork potato skins and they were the size of a teeny tiny potato...one that had probably been grown in Smurf village...I mean they were tiny.  

For a pre-game spot that is literally a stone's throw from the ballpark...this place is ridiculously overpriced and not at all the fun hang out it used to be.  

Yes, when I say over priced for where it is and what it is for....I mean over priced.  The quality of food has gone down.  Not to mention, my beer was not very cold at all!  

I would have given it two stars, but the service was very friendly and very helpful.  

Need to find a new place to hang out before the game!"}
{"text":"Convenient place to grab a drink after a Diamondbacks game, which is why we ended up there. The service was painfully slow & they were constantly hurrying us to close out."}
{"text":"Instead of watching the Phillies having BP we decided to save a few bucks and get our buzz on at Game Seven Grill located just outside the entrance gates. With ample seating and plenty of flat screens Game Seven is your typical sports bar.

We decided to share a couple of appetizers to enjoy with our drinks. Definitely nothing to write home about. Very average tasting/processed food that was more filler than anything else. The drinks were good but the service was pretty lackluster considering the customers-to-employee ratio. It was just too difficult to get another round and WAY to difficult to get our bill AND pay our bill. I think if we sat at the bar at least the drink experience would have been better.

I'd come back to Game Seven Grill in the future but it would be primarily for drinks only. The service and food do not justify having a full-on meal there especially with all of the other options available in and around the stadium."}
{"text":"Game Seven Grill is likely still in business due to the prime location adjacent to Chase Field and the fact that if you arrive early to a game or an event, there are not many (perhaps any) other choices of places to go for a quick drink or bite before the gates open.

I didn't even check Yelp prior to my visit yesterday, but as I waited in line for a couple of pre-game bloody mary drinks, I was not surprised by the 2 star average rating.

On a positive note, Game Seven Grill is super convenient to Chase Field and it has a pleasant beer garden with plenty of open seating and some games for kiddos ie: cornhole.

On a negative note, the service is awful.  I went inside to order and the bartenders were slow as molasses... When I finally got to the front of the line I learned that the drinks were pre-batched, which you would think would speed things up, but no-- not so much.  I also had to ask for olives in my drinks, and by the reaction I received, you would have thought I asked for specialty olives with bacon or additional garnish.  I got them but no service with a smile here.

Regardless, I did get a decent Bloody Mary and a place to hang with friends before the D-back game... I wouldn't go out of my way to return here, but would visit again to pre-game; this time with lower expectations."}
{"text":"You probably don't want to be short staffed on Opening Day. Took 30 minutes to order at the bar, then the bartender forgot to give us the drinks. Who knows how long before we get the nachos we ordered. 

Also, can you make the upstairs patio nonsmoking? All the doors were open and the smoke stink was getting inside. So gross."}
{"text":"What I thought would be a good spot since it's immediately next to Chase Field, turned out to be a bad idea. Smelled awful when I came in, almost like raw sewage. And the place was pretty much empty following a game which was a surprise. The patio was empty too. Wouldn't come back again for free beers!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm not surprised that the bar outside the stadium is not great, but I am still so underwhelmed. If you want to drink, then I suppose this place is ok, but if you want food, then this ain't the place.  

Very basic and very average bar food.  It reminded me of the food I'd expect at a small airport in the 80s. 

The workers were nice, but not necessarily helpful.  We walked in and spoke with a gentleman greeting people at a host table on the patio. I asked for a table for hour. He directed me towards a door on the far right.  After going in there, there was no real direction. I found a host stand, but after waiting five minutes discovered there wasn't a host!  Tracked down a bartender who said to find a table outside and order from the bar and it will be delivered.  Went back outside looking for a table and there weren't any available.  Went back inside and found a table where people were leaving and took it... the waitress was nice and helpful, but she was swamped.  Tried to find someone to refill out shot-glass size water and soda. No luck. Blah,blah, blah you know the story. 

Anyway, if you want to drink and get drunk so much that you need to stumble to the stadium, then this is your place.  If not, try any place else."}
{"text":"I try to live by the 'Golden Rule' so I will try it in this review and see what happens???  Rating Scale 1-5 like the stars above. Service : 1 
Food: 3 
Add both: 4 
Divided by 2 = 2 Stars 
Then the question, \"Did we get our money's worth? Uh, not sayin'. Now I want you to understand, that's the question one should always think about after any purchase! Let me close this review with the line from the Disney movie classic, \"Bambi\", Thumper speaking- \"If you can't say sometin' nice, don't say notin' at all.\"; The food was okay. I'm out!"}
{"text":"The location is outstanding, but the menu is bland and the drinks are quite overpriced. Service is about what you'd expect, but the place has possibilities. I'll be watching for signs of new management and/or ownership ...when I see it, I'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoy a well placed sports bar...literally a few footsteps from the Danks stadium. Sat in the bar at a high top table and took a server about 15 minutes to come over to the table. We ordered a few drinks...brought one and not the other. Menu...where do I start...oh wait this is very simple. There is about 10 items to choose from total. I will say I ordered the BBQ chicken nachos and they were amazing but for some reason again took 30 minutes to come out. Keep in mind this place was not extremely busy. Horrible service overall!!"}
{"text":"Three stars for being directly across the street from Chase Field. Great place to meet people before a baseball game. Besides that, not a whole lot to say. Cold beer, average wings/burgers. Honestly, most people would never go if not for the location. But the location is perfect, so it's usually pretty full on game days. Pro tip: If you are just drinking head to the patio where they usually have beer tubs rather than wait for a server."}
{"text":"Went here before our game on Saturday. There was only one person working the bar upstairs. We waited in a long line for almost 30 minutes just to order our food. We then waited over an hour for our food to come, there was no other employees to talk to upstairs to see what was going on. We ended up leaving without the food we paid for."}
{"text":"Horrible service... cold food ... good thing beers come in cans. Bugs in mixed drinks... bar rescue couldn't save this hell hole."}
{"text":"This place needs to be on bar rescue! Came here after the game tonight and the staff was getting at each other after last call. Yelling while there is still 30 people in the building. Where's a manager to get everyone together and act like a staff!!"}
{"text":"Situated right smack in front of the ballpark, this is an easy meeting spot for pregame drinks.  It's only open for home games, so they definitely have their niche.  We only stopped in for drinks before and after the game and didn't eat. Although we did see massive plates of nachos being served next to us and they looked fantastic.  The bar staff was a little on the slow side.  Would I make an effort to go here when any other time? No, but for a pre/post game drink it is just fine"}
{"text":"Great place to go before Diamondbacks games, not a lot going on afterwards. Drinks are about the same price as the Diamondbacks game.

Bartenders were very friendly and served everyone quickly."}
{"text":"Tonight was the second time I had been to the Game 7 Grill this season. I am used to buying a couple beers at this place outside before Dbacks games and have done so over the years, even as it has changed hands. Prices seem higher this year...in fact, seem about on par with beer prices inside Chase Field. 

Tonight's game was likely the biggest crowd of the year for the Dbacks. I ordered a $6 Bud Light, in the aluminum bottle. The server advised me that they were all out of Bud Light in the bottles. That was at 5:40 pm - an hour-and-a-half before the game. Really? If I am going to get fleeced for a $6 bottle of beer, the least they can do is have it in stock! I opted for the $7 Bud Light draft and soon regretted that I had dropped any money at this place. 

I am done with this place. As mentioned, their prices are now about the same as inside the stadium. At least I know Chase Field is well stocked."}
{"text":"Very bad service... It takes forever for everything... Getting seated, food orders, food arrival... They say the grilled cheese has bacon but it's no where to be found... If it wasn't so close to the field we won't even be here... Restaurant rescue where are you?"}
{"text":"We waited over an hour only to be told we had to sit at high top because they can't seat parties of two at low tables. Due to back issues cannot do high chairs. Alternative offered was to sit on crowded patio by asking strangers to move over and then go stand in yet another line because no table service on patio. Will never go back and will be sure to tell anyone I know to never ever go thetr"}
{"text":"I go here often because it's a convenient spot to meet up before the game, but after they treated my friends and I so rudely this past weekend I'll never bother again. We grabbed a beer at the bar in the back because it was less crowded and we were standing in a corner and in front of the stairs that were blocked off from public access anyway but we got yelled at (and I literally mean yelled at) to move because that area wasn't for standing room. (Like I said, I go often and we actually always stand on that side of the bar and it's always pretty crowded so I don't even think that's a rule.) So, we moved to the other bar and another guy came over and yelled at us AGAIN! Apparently we were still in the way. We actually tried to ask him where standing room was but he interrupted us and said either get out of the way and go outside. He was treating a group of 30ish year olds who were half a beer in like we were rowdy college kids causing a scene! It was really obnoxious. I don't think I can bring myself to give money when they treated us like they didn't even want us there."}
{"text":"If you want a pregame cocktail find another place. I was at Game Seven Grill 45 minutes before first pitch and almost took that long to get a beer. Only 2 very long lines available to order a drink. Apparently management was not aware a baseball game would be happening?"}
{"text":"I realize most people only write a review when something goes awry or they are looking to complain...unfortunately, this is one of those times.  My family and I went to Game Seven Grill on the evening before Superbowl 49, at around 7:15pm.  While we waited for a table, I used the restroom.  It was a mess, lacking in toilet paper and with mounds of wet paper on the floor.  As I returned to the hostess podium, I saw another female patron tell the manager about the condition of the bathroom, so I did not.  At that point, we were seated, at approximately seven thirty.  As with Dwayne O.'s review, we were seated in the back area of the restaurant, in the new girl's section.  Our server, was quick to greet us and take our order.  We were seated ten feet from the bar, so we guessed that our order of three sodas would not take long....we were wrong.  At 7:49 we received our drinks, nearly twenty minutes after we had been waiting.  Two bartenders were just standing behind the bar, but seemed unconcerned that we were sitting ten feet away with no drinks, no silverware and no food.  We did also notice at least five bussers who walked around with bus tubs cleaning tables and removing plates from other patrons.  When our server brought our drinks, she explained it was her first day (!) and said that someone was supposed to help her out with dropping off the drinks, but they \"sent a lot of people home.\"  On a Saturday night.  At 7:30pm.  With the Superbowl in town and hundreds of thousands of people milling around outside...Yeah, sure.  As we waited for our food, we noted a couple who sat at one of the tables beside us and then move to the bar.  They received their food before we did, as did the other two tables around us.  At 8:10, a full twenty minutes after the drinks, we received our food.  Our server again apologized and said the \"kitchen had gotten backed up\" but that did not seem to slow the service to the others around us. The menu was very limited, so we ordered two cheeseburgers and my son ordered wings.  The burgers were okay; nothing special and I could not taste the pepper jack cheese on my burger.  My son, 12, eats anything...and I mean anything.  However, he could only eat four of his eight wings because they were a touch too tough and over-sauced.  He got 8 wings for $10.95 with no side...clearly a disappointment.  When we were finally finished, we spoke with the manager at the hostess station.  I explained our disappointment, he apologized several times and said there was nothing he could do for this experience, just the next one and I assured him there would be no \"next one\". As a former restaurant server and manager, I can honestly say that I will never again visit Game Seven Grill."}
{"text":"The service at this place is terrible. We couldn't get any bartenders' attention. & when we asked about our food we were ignored by a server(?). We waited over 50 minutes for nachos, a flatbread, & wings. The flatbread & wings were decent, the only reason for 2 stars. The nachos were cold & soggy. Very disappointed.
There's too much great food within walking distance to ever return here."}
{"text":"Great location before a Dbacks game! But not worth the money! 
Poor service. Food was just average. Paper plates and plastic cups for beer! Really? Won't go back!"}
{"text":"The food is decent but the service is behind horrible.  Sheriff Joe provides better service in the jail to the inmates.  I'd recommend going hungry and thirsty over this place."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the new game 7 apparently the owners wanted a more family themed bar/restaurant which I can understand for pregame and change to menu looks good although I did not get any food. The fun ways of the old beer girls outside with a big crowd of fun is over no drink specials except for Sunday day games supposedly and drinks after the game forget about it since they close at 11 lame but they're loss in revenue, went to Coaches Corner right across the street from game 7 for after game fun and great drink specials. Bring back Sliders I always went there before and after games will not return."}
{"text":"This was an overall disappointing dining experience. We wanted to get a quick bite to eat before the game. There was a considerable wait which was okay because we knew it was busy. After waiting 25 minutes we were seated. Our waitress did not acknowledge the table for almost 20 minutes after we were sat. From there it went downhill. Horrible horrible service. Ordered the pulled chicken and it came out looking like pulled pork - lots of low quality dark meat. The waitress says \"this is pork\" and says she will get a new one. Then the chef comes out and says nope it was chicken. They bring out a new sandwich - the same nasty chicken. There are cheap drinks but I would not recommend eating here - we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Convenient if you are going to the D'backs game as it's right outside the entrance gates.

The menu is fairly limited and is pretty BBQ-centric. Not the greatest burger I have ever had, but not the worst either.

Full bar and several taps including some local craft brews.

Works for when you've misjudged your travel time, don't have time to explore the surrounding downtown area (which surely has better offerings) and want to avoid paying ballpark prices for food inside the stadium."}
{"text":"This place has horrible food. I am sorry. It really isn't that good. Nothing we sampled was worth writing about, the pulled pork was dry, the loaded potato skins were wet (oily) and the pretzel cheese was tasty but so runny it wouldn't stay on the pretzels - which weren't that good themselves.

The three stars are for the following:

Live Music - the Stage is perfect, and the location is so fun, and the band they had (The Hamptons Band) was excellent.  It was so fun outside and everyone was dancing and clapping and drinking (and trying to smoke...but getting busted! LOL! No smoking on the patio on either side!)

Stephanies - Both of them are amazing and they both worked really hard to help us all day.  They are a great team.  The service and management there is really quite good. They were running out of everything in sight (ketchup, soda, ice, etc.) and they worked hard to please.  I was there for a while, so I saw how hard they worked!

The Apple Pie Dessert Thing - Too good...so good! Like a big chewy turnover with apples and chewy yummy crust! Vanilla bean ice cream with caramel drizzled over it. YUMMMY

It's hard to avoid this place if you like baseball, so go after the game for a drink and yummy apple stuff.  And, hopefully there will be fun music! :-)"}
{"text":"Ordered the pretzel basket as an appetizer prior to watching the D-back at Chase Field. For $8, we got four little pretzel bites. We would have been better off buying a full pretzel at Chase field as it was cheaper there!"}
{"text":"Poorly staffed. Either need to get better quality servers/bartenders and/or just more staff working. Servers were running around like crazy, driving people to the bar to close out or get drinks. Similarly, bartenders could not multitask. It was awkward to watch as the two bartenders looked lost working at snail speed or they would form into pods with whom looked like mgmt for minutes at a time. It took me 10 mins to get a beer. The group of three next to me wanted to cash out to get into the game. That started to build up tension as staff ignored them. Lost out on sales. Multiple groups stopped by next to me to grab a quick drink, all of who just left, went into the game because they didn't want to wait any longer. To add, the bartender didn't know where basic bottles were or if you had them. Lost money! And finally, you are a place right next to a pro baseball stadium and you don't have the MLB package or at least sporting events on all the tv's? I asked about a certain game which I received a swift \"no\", and left with nothing. Not an offer to change the channel. There was an R rated movie on with explicit subtitles playing on multiple tv's. I couldn't believe it at first. What the heck are you guys doing? I'm guessing because you are next to the stadium, you believe you will make sales regardless of quality of staff and product. Disappointing business portfolio. I won't ever be spending my money here again. The bud light tasted like bud light. That's a positive."}
{"text":"Worst service!  Waitress was horrible kept disappearing. So disappointed!  Get new wait staff! Who know what to do when restaurant is busy!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can see how this place can get 1 to 2 stars but we had a good experience so this is why I give it a 4.  Due to it being GameDay the wait obviously was probably longer then normal.  The best part is the bar had no wait and we walked in and sat down right away.  

Our bartender was nice and quick,  the drinks and food came out fast.  We ordered the fritter and quesadilla which were very good and paired well with the sauces served.  

It does have a upstairs and outside patio that has some games to entertain you like table tennis.   

We will be coming back when we come to anther game or just anytime."}
{"text":"Very sadly disappointed. We were looking for a place to hang out before the game, get some good food and beers and pregame. The beer garden was nice. We went to the beer cart, got our drinks and that was fine. Went inside to order food and I wish I wouldn't have. As I was looking over the menu the bartender was talking about how sad it is that people don't tip. I ordered the below photoed food. A burger and nachos. 30 dollars before the obligatory tip. Food was delivered in baskets with no napkins, forks, or condiments while other tables were brought baskets that had all of the above in them. No service at all in the beer garden. Which is fine, but would have been nice. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Great location and bartenders. management needs to keep bathroom stocked and clean. Great atmosphere when the really good band \"Ratio\" was playing. They brought everyone's spirits up even after the loss!  Would return for the cold beer and to hear that band!"}
{"text":"From the reviews it seems that the owner/managers or anyone working at this establishment do not really care too much that the service is the worst. All because they know, no matter what people will return because its closest to the stadium. The hostess was nice. The waiter was okay, seemed to be stuck w too many tables. The food was cafeteria food. Not worth it. Sadly this review won't change much but if you don't really care and only need a quick beer and crap food, this is definitely your place!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight the night before Super Bowl 49 at around 7;30 pm. With Super Bowl Central Downtown I was going to give up on eating downtown but noticed there was not a line to get in which should have been a sign.

Only had to wait 5 minutes and were seated as far from the entrance as possible and I thought this is going to be bad because we were tucked in a corner away from everyone else. We sat there for over 10 minutes  with no one that ever came to our table to even acknowledge us. My wife asked one of the people if there was some one to take our order and a nice person came over to get our drinks. The sad thing was we found out our real waitress walked by us a number of times without even talking to us. Her name was Merideth. The other person who was to setup the beer garden took our order and was the one who got our drinks, when she got our order she told us today was her first day. After we got our food and we were almost done eating Merideth came by to finally acknowledge us and then asked us about our drinks. I told my wife Merideth did not deserve a penny and a the tip should have gone to the other peraon.

As for the food, the menu consists of wings, one burger, pulled pork sandwich and 2 pizzas.

I ordered the burger medium and came out well, the fries were good and the bun was too big for the burger patty. It came with lettuce tomato and onions.

The pulled pork sliders were good and topped with a tasty bbq sauce.

We also had the cheese pizza which the top was half burnt.

The wings were meaty.

Should have not eaten here and the service did not exist.

Will not come back and hope you don't either. Service absolutely  was terrible except the new girl. She gives this place one star."}
