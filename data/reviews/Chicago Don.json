{"text":"Just tried the restaurant. I love the environment there. People are really sweet and nice. The rice meal and desserts are my love even I do not like sweet food."}
{"text":"Okay, so I was also excited by the concept, but this restaurant has to really change things up if it is going to survive. I came here for my birthday (May 7,2016) with a group of 8.   Service: Probably the best part of my experience so I am going to lead with that. The server was incredibly kind and attentive (which may not have been difficult since we were the only ones there ... on a Saturday evening. A couple did come in later, but that's it). He created us cocktails that weren't on the menu, and was just overall awesome.   Food: Food was okay. Not bad (except the dessert was really stale). But honestly the tapas concept served in individual dishes just doesn't work here. It would make way more sense of food was brought out for the table family style and you could take how ever much or little as you wanted. The soup was okay, and the salad was pretty horrible. I would give the food itself a 3.5/5 which is not bad but when you are forced to eat what is on your plate, it stops being an enjoyable experience. We didn't even make it to the end of the rounds because we were just so full.   Value: I think the price point and waste is WAY too high. At $35 for what you get, I don't think I would go back. I would value it more at a $20-25 range. I recommend that the owners visit Free Times Cafe on a Sunday Brunch to see good quality, home-style cooking done right at a reason price point. After drinks, tax, tip you are looking at a $60+ meal, and it isn't worth that, it just isn't.   I do hope this restaurant makes the changes they need to survive."}
{"text":"I started my review with two stars and then after consideration dropped it to 1 as the food was terrible, however, this is a moot point as after walking by it today, it is already closed."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for a friends birthday dinner. It's suppose to be a buffet style restuarant but the servers actually come around and bring the meals to you. I gave it two stars because the interior design was nice and the staff was OK. However, the food itself was not good at all. We had a total of supposedly 8 meals, in which it was random foods, some Im pretty certain were not even italian, and the size portion were tiny. I think i was more full off drinking water than the food itself. Additionally, the staff was slow, the wait between when the courses were brought to you were long and unorganized as some people at our table were sometimes missed.   Not to mention their dessert 'apricot macaron' needs some work on the macaron-looking-part, however it tasted better than it looked.   Definitely would not go back, to put it simply, food was not great and it is way overpriced."}
{"text":"Having people wanting to get in even before a restaurant is officially opened is always a good sign. The Chicago Don is a brand new concept and an exciting new iteration of the previous Sheesha Lounge on Bloor near Ossington.  I attended a pre-opening tasting menu which is the basic new concept being offered, for what I believe is the first time in Toronto. And aside from some of the basic pre-opening challenges that any new restaurant faces, the ambiance, service and food were all good. Some dishes lacked the brilliance of others however it was explained to us that there were still some technical issues that were in the process of being perfected.  The interior is a combination of new bar meets old world charm. The main dining area is warm with very comfortable seats in a subdued, however bustling ambiance. In the light of a \"rehearsal\" type of service, the wait staff were friendly, prompt and always available. The \"Don\" himself, Ilan Kritzer was ever present and working his charm and passion throughout the restaurant, eager to show us the bar, kitchen and the new technology employed from cooking to entering orders.  The food service concept is a mix of tapas, Italian dim sum and an all-you-can-eat (as it is ready to be served) tasting menu. There are 8 courses served individually in a rotation, hot from the kitchen to the table. The menu changes daily from over 80 different old world recipes. The dishes were Italian-themed with variations on that such as coconut shrimp and various presentations of beef, chicken, seafood and desserts that are decidedly small (as we are told) to allow for a wide range of dishes.  It seemed to be a great start to what I can imagine will only get better. The cost is $25 on weekdays and $30 on weekends for all the food you can eat. There is a decent drink list with some hard to find wines and cocktails..  There is a lounge area in the back that looks inviting and is a great place to hang out with friends in a private, comfortable area for drinks and snacks. This would be a great space to book for a private party or corporate event.  Overall my rating is based on a limited exposure to a brand new concept which was obviously conceived with lots of forethought and planning. The Chicago Don officially opened the second week of April and promises to be a place worth visiting and coming back again and again. Good work guys!"}
{"text":"3hours later, we were finally able to complete our dinner. As explained by the owner at the end of our meal, it was their first week opening and had some technical issues, but the wait time was ridiculously long. We were told at the beginning that there is a circulating 7 tapa dishes served every 10mins and that we can eat as many rounds as possible, however, \"no one has ever went to round 2.\" And now I can see why! The wait time ranged from 15-35mins per item, and each dish took about 2 mins to eat. Thus, lasting us 3 hours before the first round was even served.  I wish I could say that the food was worth the wait, but it really wasn't. From stale bread, to soggy lasagne, and bland soup, only the desserts were the best part of the meal, but overall the quality of the food wasn't that impressive. It reminded me of mediocre banquet hall food that was luke-warm and lacked quality.   I give this place 2 stars only because the servers were working very hard to please the restless customers and the table was offered a free Ferraro rocher drink to sample and tie over the wait time. The environment was very clean and classy - they still kept some of the decor, large panoramic photos and their drink options from the previous Sheesha Lounge.  Maybe with time, they will work out the kinks and improve their menu and we will try it out once again."}
{"text":"Interesting concept, that could be great but unfortunately this place misses the mark. It's an odd mish mash, that doesn't all add up. From the dated decor and moody music, to the sub par service and just average food (that you'd expect to be all Italian but isn't).   Hoping they iron things out and step up their game a bit."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on the Saturday the second day they were open.  I think this place would be 4 out of 5 at least if they resolved some issues which may only be issues as it was there second day open.  However at this time it is only 3 out of 4 maybe lower.  They offer a 8 course tapas menu that is all you can eat menu 7 main course and dessert.  They keep cycling through the 7 main courses until you've had enough and ask for dessert.  They also offer bread, soup or salad to start.  I would say I really like 5 of the seven courses I had.  My favorite being eggplant parmigiana with risotto.  I also really liked there meat ball dish too.  I would complain about the portion sizes.   I understanding this is a tapas place so you're getting small dishes over and over.  However these are a bit to small for example the meat ball dish was just 1 medium size meat ball.  I believe it should be at minimum 2 meat balls. Yes you can get it again but your have to wait 6 more rounds of items before you get a second meat ball.    My other complaint is there was just too much time between courses.  As the course are so small you need all of 2 minutes to eat a course and the set time supposed to be 10 minutes between courses.  Which I think is too long and on this night it was longer then there estimated 15 minutes between courses we worked out.  So after being there 2 and half hours we had had salad, 8 main courses and dessert.  Only went through one whole cycle and then one additional item.  Which is just ridicules would have liked to have had all the courses twice in that time frame.  I hope they just need to fine turn the operation and speed things up.  Because as they are selling it as all you can eat they should speed it up no more than 7 min between courses so you feel like you left after you had all you can eat not left after reach the maximum amount of time you would want to spend there.  As I said I loved the risotto but it was one of the last dishes I received so to get it again I would have had to been there another hour as would have to had 5 other dishes before that one and wasn't willing to do that.  It would be nice if you could after a round of dishes just skip and get the ones you wanted more of.  If service was faster than it would be okay to pass on few dishes waiting for you favorite.  The service was pretty good aside from course delivery taking too long, waitress were all very friendly and attentive.  I believe we met all the safe including the owner although didn't introduce himself but looked a lot like the guy on the sign.    The absolute highlight of the meal was dessert we got a trio of miniature desserts including Tiramisu, Apricot Kisses (meringue sandwich cookie with Apricot jam in the middle) & The Fantasy Date (A Date bar).  The Tiramisu was excellent but the Apricot Kisses were just unbelievable.  I could of eaten a dozen.  When we asked for the bill I explained how much I enjoyed them and was brought another 3.    As long as the speed up the rotation of their course and increase the portion size slightly I think this could be a great place.  It is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I was really excited for the opening of this restaurant. Such an interesting concept - 8 or so small portion rounds of delicious Italian dishes with something for everyone. I recommend this place for anyone from date nights to birthdays.  I found the service to be friendly and the atmosphere to be warm and inviting. As more time passes, I see them perfecting the experience and I look forward to being a regular customer!"}
