{"text":"I purchased a groupon for this restaurant.  I had never heard of it, but I love Sunday brunch.  When you walk in, you are greeted by friendly people.  The room is a banquet hall so it is open.  You can sit at round banquet tables for large groups or small side tables if you are a twosome.  The music is notably unique.  It ranges from jazz to instrumental class rock.  It is a comfortable place to have a cup of coffee.  They leave the coffee urn at the table along with a pitcher of water.    I skipped the sweets tables, donuts and pastries are not my favorite thing in the morning.  It looked like a nice set-up.  I went right to the basic breakfast food area: bacon, sausage, eggs, hash browns, toast points and sausage gravy.  I tried the toast points with sausage gravy, the hash browns and the bacon.  I loved everything.  I was surprised how crispy the bacon was without being burnt.  It was a nice mix to have the toast points with gravy.  It is not as heavy as it would have been with a biscuit.  Next thing, I tried was the omelette bar.  There were five toppings to choose from.  Very impressed.  Small omelettes to leave you with room for other things.  I tried cheese, green peppers and ham.  The chef was not cheap with the cheese.  It was delicious.    They had made to order waffles, honey baked chef carved ham and two soups on the table.  Then it began to merge into lunch.  There was meatloaf, chicken, alfredo sauce with noodles, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese...essentially no shortage of choices.  However, this was not as good as the breakfast side.  The meatloaf was overseasoned and the mac and cheese lacked cheese.  It was more oily than anything.  They also had a breadcrumb crust that was so thick it overpowered the noodles. The stuffing was good, but nothing to make it stand out.    I never made it to the dessert table.  Sadly.  The service was great, but overall for $14 dollars a person, I would not go back.  The lunch half was unexceptional.  The breakfast was great but I could head over to the Egg and I for under $14."}
{"text":"I wish someone had warned me before I met with Chris and booked my event here. If I could give this place NO STARS, I would.   SHORT STORY:   - The owner, Chris, has a reputation amongst the bridal industry in Madison as being unprofessional and threatening to cancel on bride's right before their events. I found this out when trying to rebook my event, which he cancelled 10 days before my wedding.  - The owner is completely unprofessional/a liar or he just really doesn't know what's going on.  - He flipped out at my wedding coordinator when she requested a meeting with him to discuss my event after his constant inconsistencies.  - HE cancelled my wedding event 10 days before the event because I requested he provide me everything in writing.   I wish someone had given me a warning about this guy. When I first met him, I thought, what a great guy and he's so accommodating... boy was I wrong. He went back on everything he said he was initially providing, quoted both my mother and me 2 different prices... until he was called out, had major attitude when confronted on all his inconsistencies. If I  had enough space to post his emails where he keeps contradicting himself... I would. He is just overall really unprofessional (and as mentioned before, has the reputation with vendors and other venues in Madison).   He's eager to take your money and add on additional charges as it gets closer to your event date. Don't trust his emailed excel sheet as a contract.... it's not.... but he will keep your deposit if YOU cancel as listed on this excel sheet. He'll give you a list of his real contract and policies literally 10 days before you event as he did to me. And then mention that you also need to put down a $500 deposit... which he didn't mention before that moment. We also would not have met had I not initially reached out to him just to confirm dates and the information we had discussed when booking.   Again, I wish someone had warned me about this guy before I had booked by event."}
{"text":"It's been a few months since my husband and I had our wedding reception here, so here is our review.  But, I should preface this with the fact that my husband and I won a prize package through NBC15 that needed to be used, in part, at the Marquis Ballroom and I felt that Chris was probably more professional working with us than with other clients because we would have easily contact NBC15 studios and made a big fuss had there been any major problems.  Pros: Chris was not fussy about letting us bring in what ever decorations we wanted to and setting everything up the way that we wanted to.  We were able to come in the day before to make sure it was set up exactly they way that we wanted to, which was nice, because then we didn't have to worry about it on the day of the wedding.  Overall, we enjoyed the appetizers: cheese-stuffed mushrooms, bruschetta, shrimp egg rolls, and bbq meatballs.  The mashed potatoes that came with the plated dinner were delicious, so was the chicken kiev.  When we were figuring out the menu, we actually met on-on-one with the cook and told him exactly what we wanted, i.e. we wanted our guests to be able to choose between a medium rare and medium well steak, and we chose green beans instead of mixed veggies for the dinners.  The cook was very accommodating in regards to the menu.  Chris let us finish cleaning up the next day, which was great because everyone was exhausted or too drunk for cleaning up at the end of the reception.    Cons:  There were quit a few cons, so I can't list them all, but here are the major ones.  Chris never made up a written contract for us, although we had the NBC15 contract, but that only covered part of the items, etc.  I ended up making a contract and an itemized list of everything that we brought in ourselves, everything that we expected them to supply for us, and a very detailed itinerary, starting from when they needed to start setting up the ballroom to when we were going to come to do the final clean up the next day.  Despite the detailed itinerary, there were still a few hiccups, like they didn't put out champagne in time for the start of the toasts and I had heard from guests that they were about 10-15 minutes late in setting up the cocktail hour.   As far as working with Chris, my best advice is to be very detailed and meticulous about what you want, how you want it done, and WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN, so that there are no questions about it later.  There were several times that he gave us different answers to the same question, so if you do decide to work with him, your best bet is to write a follow-up email to him detailing exactly what you talked about, so that there are no questions later on.   The biggest issue I had with the next day cleanup is that we forgot 1 decoration, a mistletoe (December wedding), and when we called the next day, Chris said that it had already been thrown out, as did one of our guests phone chargers that was left at the ballroom.   The ballroom looks nice inside overall, but if you look closely, you can see some burn marks here and there, and snags in the carpet.  I thought they did an okay job cleaning the ballroom before the reception, but could have done better.  Also, Chris had told us the the front entrance floor would be redone before our wedding, and that never happened.   Overall, our guests said that the food was good.  They enjoyed the appetizers, people liked the chicken kiev, mashed potatoes and after dinner root beer floats that we had.  The steak was hit and miss, because some guests complained that their steak was overcooked.  But, the kitchen did take the overcooked steaks back and gave them new steaks.  I heard from guests that the pasta primavera was so-so.  However, we were able to take home any meals from guests that did not show up.   There was apparently a mouse running around right outside the front entrance of the ballroom.  Luckily, one of the groomsmen \"took care\" of the mouse before the majority of the guests had a chance to see it or be freaked out.  Also, we had a December wedding and they did not salt the walkway to the front entrance.  One of our guests and close friend ended up salting it before the majority of the guests arrived.    Overall, though, on the day of the wedding, I do believe that Chris and the staff tried to be as professional as possible, although, I think part of this was because we actually had crew from NBC15 stop by to film part of the reception.    It also helped that my husband and I are very meticulous (and controlling) about how we want things done, so we made it very clear to Chris that things needed to be done the way that we wanted.  If my husband and I had to do it all over again, without the NBC15 prize money, I can honestly say that we would not have booked the Marquis ballroom.  The cost is just about the same as an other reception hall (without the prize money), and the pros did not outweigh the cons.    I hope this helps whomever in their decision."}
