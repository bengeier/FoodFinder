{"text":"Food is mediocre.  Service is excellent!  Fish Tacos, Chicken wings are ok.  Best for late night, and convieniently near home.  Pricey for quality and quantity of food.  Sometimes dirty but overall average."}
{"text":"We wanted to sit outside and enjoy dinner but they have a stupid band that starts at 8pm. Way too early. What a waste"}
{"text":"Very good food and fantastic service.  Great place to watch a game with lots of TVs."}
{"text":"I have been here several times in the past and thought that the food was OK. But, tonight I met a friend who suggested we go and thought great I have no idea what I'm going to get. They bring you these Paul Bundy size menu's and there's nothing I want to eat.   Tonight though was another story. They just redid their menu. They have so many new appealing options, like, BYO (build your own) Salads. You can pick your fruit, cheese and meat that best suit you. They also added fish tacos to the menu which I highly recommend. They were excellent. A little pico de gallo, lettuce and grilled Thalia... yummmm. It comes with fries or their homemade chips (killer!) or the vegetable of the day. I had fresh zucchini. My meal was $8.95. I didn't think that was unreasonably priced. They also added several sandwiches to the menu ranging from 8.95 to 10.95.   Our waitress was attentive and was quick to replace my empty little soldiers :) Actually she suggested visiting this place on Exit 28 on Monday night's for their $2 Corona specials. I appreciated the special attention (I always like a deal).   If you have been before and was like me a little skeptical, give them another try. As for the decor.... please people... it's a sports bar. What do you want crystal chandlers and cloth napkins?"}
{"text":"Why Oh Why is it sooo dang loud.  After a long day in the office I want to chill and I find this place too be too loud to have a conversation or relax.  The problem is I like their food.  So I suffer through.  The fish tacos are my favorite but they have good salads too.  The prices are reasonable.  There is like a thousand TV's so your sure not to miss any sports event.  On Wednesday nights they have Trivia which is a lot of fun but you guessed it.... WAY TO LOUD."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there and had the slowest service ever.  Had to hunt the waitress down to get drink refills. Management was walking around cleaning tables off, but ignored or didn't see our two empty drink glasses.  Had to ask for the check and once we finally got it she disappeared again. She wasn't on the floor at other tables and the restaurant was only half full. The food was average. It was a disappointing visit."}
{"text":"Chicken wings were over cooked. Sent them back for properly cooked and charred. Not much better. Big change from a year ago when wings were good.  Ice tea was good.  Service was excellent.  Tab with tip for 10 plain Jane wings charred with tea and 20% tip was $19.00. It will be a cold day in h---  before I ever order wings there again."}
{"text":"The service was slow and the staff did not seem to care.  The food was VERY average for the price.  There are better restuarants near by."}
{"text":"We are frequent visitors of the HT franchise. We were excited to try the new one here in Indian Trail. Sadly, this restaurant is not up to Hickory Tavern standards.   Restaurant is too small. Tables are on top of each other. There isn't a separation from bar to dining area. After waiting for 20 mins for a seat in the \"dining room \" we we jammed in up against the bar stools.   We were dining with a toddler, which can be challenging. After placing our order our waitress did not return. After waiting 45 minutes I did seek out a manager. Our food was brought out finally !   Portions seem smaller than a typical HT. Meal literally came with six fries. The server actually remarked that my burger was sadly lacking bleu cheese crumbles.    At this point with a screaming, tired, toddler we just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"The bar food here is well above average.  They have a variety of burgers and they do them well.  They have been doing sweet potato fries before they became a trend, and serve them with a honey butter that is a real treat.  The salads are good, the apps are good, the dinner selections are good.  They do a good job with the drinks.  There is enough of a crowd to make it feel like a good time, but it is not crazy noisy.  But what impressed me enough to write this review was our experience when something went wrong.  Just when I was wondering why our food was taking so long, someone (not our waiter) came to apologize, said that one of the orders had been done wrong and was being re-done so it was right.  A few moments later yet another person came with the same message.  I was favorably impressed that they made the effort to get the order right AND that they had the good grace to come and apologize.  That earned 4 stars from me, and we definitely will keep going back."}
{"text":"Horrible food and horrible service. I would give this place no stars if I had the option. Service was more concerned about themselves then their customers. Food tasted like it had freezer burn or old. Don't bother wasting your money on over priced blah food and mediocre service."}
{"text":"Will not be coming back. We ordered two baked potatoes because we usually love them. Got them, and they were cold. We got honey bee wings. Let me just say before this time we got the same thing and they were undercooked. The ones we got this time we literally all burnt. I get they are charred. But all I could see was black! All I tasted was a bad burned crunch of chicken.  These wings should not have gone out. They were not edible. Waitress brought us more and more and more wings. We didn't need them all. Just fix what you gave me. Don't over do it. Manager gave us two more potatoes but we had already eaten the cold ones. How about we make sure food just comes out right. Make sure it's not sitting at the expo window getting cold or pay attention before you burn my wings. Show more attention to detail and show that y'all care about presentation, taste and customer service, because you don't have the friendliest staff around."}
{"text":"Had a delicious meal. Great server even though it was very busy. Fish rtacos very tasty and the fish bayou very satisfying. Must try for all who like crab is the crab dip appetizers."}
{"text":"We decided to try hickory tavern on our trip to Charlotte.  Unfortunately, we will not return.  The food was barely good.  The spinach dip appetizer was gross. It was made up of mayo, a ton of red onions, and very little spinach and artichokes not to mention that the large (which was recommended for our family of 4) was smaller than the average size and expensive ($9).  The buffalo chicken sandwich was decent but could be the cause of major stomach issues the next day and the turkey sandwich was loaded again with purple onions even though we ordered it without.    Disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"We love going there because the outdoor seating is beautiful with the nice view of the greenway and uptown.  They also provide water bowl for dogs.  Their burgers are great, juicy patty served with hot fries.  Drink menu is big, different special on a daily and monthly basis.  One thing missing on the menu is soup, and I don't think they have pasta either."}
{"text":"Came here for the 4pm Pats game and hung around for the evening game. Lauren was a delight! Very helpful and personable! She never rushed me even though I held on to one of her tables of almost six hours. Great food and drinks for the game!! A manager was never far from my table and clearly involved with their staff and each guest that walked through the door. Even though it was busy I felt like I was the only table that mattered. Definitely a pla c e I will want to come back to!!"}
{"text":"I eat here maybe once a month, and it's consistently good.  Friendly service and lots of TVs.  My favorite item is the Buffalo Chicken Tacos with Sweet Potato Fries.  The Fries are always perfect!"}
{"text":"CONSISTENTLY VERY GOOD. Where chain food can be shaky with the quality and consistency, you have NOTHING to worry about here! They have a small outdoor seating area so if you can snag a table that faces into Uptown the views are great. Why bother eating at Dresslers (their neighbor) when you can eat here for half the price. This restaurant is casual so you can just stop in for some beers. I've been several times and had the burger, wings, pretzels, and cedar plank salmon (extra well done please. Seriously, you can't kill it enough). All items were excellent. My guests have had the salads, rib eye, & filet and they enjoyed every bite. There is a menu item called 'bucket of boat trash' for $29. It's some kind of seafood mix. For $29 I would never order anything with the word trash in it. I'm sure it's tongue in cheek, but the Hickory Tavern marketing execs may want to rethink this one.   My only gripe about this place is the parking in the Metropolitan. It's not Hickory Taverns fault. Every time I park there everyone has road rage trying to squeeze in a space. You get frustrated and anxious and end up parking on the 5th floor just to wait for an elevator and end up being late for dinner. TIP: Where ever you do park in the garage, take the stairs and walk down as you will get there faster."}
{"text":"Service is soooo slow.  There were eight servers standing around.  And we could r get any of them to make eye contact.  So sad."}
{"text":"Redeemed!  I wrote a scathing review of our last visit. What a difference a great server and attentive management makes.  Food was super fast and delicious. The burger was hot and juicy.  Tavern chips delivered promptly to the table along with our beverages. Even the music track was spot on for an enjoyable meal. Thank you!"}
{"text":"All you can eat crab legs not worth $40!  After the third cluster they start bringing out SCRAPS that you have to pick thru.  When we asked the server about this, she said that's their policy....so they do this by design??!!  After that they bring out small, old looking pieces with hardly any meat in them.  The french fries and hushpuppies are one serving only.  Several other places around (for less money) serve consistent quality crab legs throughout the whole meal."}
{"text":"While I wasn't in for a game, I can see why people would love this place for a game or a fight.  Monster TV's behind the bar, and smaller one's every direction you look in.  The food was reasonably priced and was above average for bar food.  If left just to the food and atmosphere I probably would have ranked this place higher, but ...  I think I just have to get used to the fact that the majority of restaurants here is the QC have poor management and either poor or poorly trained staff.  The manager was on the floor for all of about 5 minutes during my few hours there.  Had he been on the floor, where he should be, he would have noticed that all but one of his waitresses were coffee clotching most of the night.  There were upwards of 4-5 at a time chit chatting at the server station.  Usually 2-3 at the service bar, and from the looks of things, a few in the kitchen.  Had my waitress stopped at my table for more than 30 seconds at a time, I may have ordered more, and hence tipped more.  There was all of one waitress who was busting her butt.  A cute, small, young woman with curly blonde hair.  She was all over her tables, the rest of the staff, not so much.   I wished she was my waitress, her tables probably had a completely different experience.    I'm really dying to give a great review with fantastic service, maybe on the next one!"}
{"text":"Great fries and burger, chicken sandwich was just ok. 20 minute wait to get our food. Ordered chips and salsa but returned, chips were cold and hard.  Quite surprised that our waitress had on soiled clothing. Apron very dirty and her pants were dirty front and back. No way a manager should allow dirty clothes."}
{"text":"Overall a decent place. The atmosphere was better than the food. This would be a great place to watch sports, especially football on Sundays. I would go back again even though the food prices are higher than expected."}
{"text":"Of all the sports bars in Charlotte, there is something about Hickory Tavern that keeps me coming back. The staff is friendly and the tvs are plentiful, indoors and out. They also have a large bar area that makes it easy to hang out with friends and still have a good view of the game.   I went this weekend to watch the Panther's game. The place was packed and the energy was high. The food is also pretty good. I like the plain jane wings (aka dry rub) and the Carolina dog, a grilled hotdog toped with chili, coleslaw and mustard. The hotdog is served with your choice of a side, so I got the sweet potato fries. The fries were okay. They were drizzled with honey (which I didn't mind, but I didn't expect). They also weren't hot (they were luke warm at best).  My friend ordered the jerk chicken wings and he really enjoyed them.   I must say that I was impressed with how attentive our waitress was. The place was full and she still took our order quickly, checked on us regularly and did it all with a smile.   Overall, this is a solid spot. They have daily drink specials, good bar food and nice servers. It's a good spot to watch the game."}
{"text":"All you can eat crab legs on Tuesdays, amazing! While the price for two is a bit high, the service is spot on, not to loud, and very open floor plan. They do have an outside area also. People who like sports and places that focus on that will be at home with all the TVs."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken tacos had were tasty but there was hardly any chicken in them: one pinkie-sized piece of chicken in each taco. Good service from the bartender and the ambiance is solid for watching sports."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm impressed.  Of course, everything is new at this location.  Ordered some nachos and good god what a plate that was!  It was basically a nacho pyramid!  Around $8, and worth every penny.  Expectantly, the bartender was a little green on the price of a Guinness draft, but, I mean, they are new so that's fine.  Extremely nice and attentive bartenders.  My first time coming to this location and I'm really pleased with the interior.  It features: gigantic projector screen(s), flat-panel tv's, classic sports bar arcade games (bowling, golf,) as well as skeeball!, clean bathrooms (however, on a different note, the right faucet of the men's bathroom is a little unsecured from it's base), nice tables and booths, and a great atmosphere with music at the right volume.  Can't wait to make this my personal sports bar!  As good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Went here once last summer and I'll never go back. I ordered 2 bloody marys and was poured a tall glass of tomato juice with barely a shot of rail vodka. I complained, the bartender mocked me... I paid and called a manager... He made me hold for 10 minites because... According to him the the bartender told him an employee was on hold for him, not a customer... He told me he'd refund my credit card charge but it never happened.  Failure on every aspect of customer service... Why subject yourself to this?"}
{"text":"Nice place.   Good alternative to the Fox and Hound.    Good food and beer selection.   Be wary though, if you don't like large crowds,  do not go at night,  because it gets packed quickly.   Lots of televisions for sports also.  I like it."}
{"text":"Recently went to this location for the first time. I love their shrimp dishes, and this time I tried the po boy sandwhich, and it was delicious! My bf and our friend both got the fish tacos, and they were awesome! Great portions! The tavern chips are our favorite b/c of the seasoned salt and the spicy ranch dip. The atmosphere was nice out on the covered patio- we had a nice view of the parkway. The service was good, and the waitress even turned off the patio heater for us and pulled up one of the plastic barriers so we could feel the breeze. And you can't beat $3 mimosas on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times, each experience pretty much the same: no prompt greeting by the host, the resturant is filthy as if no one has bussed a table before, the food is average at best but certainly overpriced and the management couldn't care less about your experience. It's a shame to waste and excellent location on such a poor resturant."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. The last time we were here we asked for just chicken tenders. We only wanted a few and didn't want a side. We were told - that can't be done. Really, you have it so why not??  The bartender at the time suggested that we order the kids tenders. We did not at this time but this past week I ordered that and as the bartender brought me my order he told us the kitchen manager said to charge us more money. We asked to speak to him to find out what was going on & he wouldnt speak with us. This says a lot when you're recommended something, then say you can't have it and in the end they rather throw your order away and let the customer walk away! Great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Very long wait for food, the wings were ok but the nachos were very soggy, they could do so much better, some beers on tap list not available, we will not go back to eat here"}
{"text":"This is definitely the worst service I've had in years. It took 10 min after being seated for a server to come to our table. After placing an order, it took 20 min for the food to arrive. We were never offered water. The sweet tea is not sweet - we had to ask for additional sweetner - they never brought it so we physically went to the server station and got it ourselves. We ordered dessert - took 15 min to arrive (from another server). We asked that person for our check - she said only our assigned server could do that - we had to physically flag her down and she was irritated b/c apparently she on the way to place another table's order (and I guess cannot multi-task). She brought the check and NEVER came back. I waited another 10 min - by this time we had been there 95 min (remember - we did not order drinks, did not order an appetizer - only entrees and a dessert). Finally, all the members of the party (3) rounded up enough cash to just pay the bill and leave b/c I was NOT going to be there until after 10 pm waiting for someone to run a credit card. In retrospect, I should have demanded to see the manager and have him run the card or just got up and left. The food was pretty good but not outstanding by any means. Combined with the TERRIBLE service, I will NOT be returning to this restaurant. From the reviews, slow and poor service is apparently not the exception. I have no idea how this restaurant has managed to stay open all these years - must be people who just want to sit and talk and watch TV and don't mind 2-3 hr waits."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Met! But watch out for game days/if they have live entertainment, it's very busy and loud. Good food and service. My family eats here a lot, one of our favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ended up leaving after 40 mins as the food did not arrive. I would leave 0 stars but 1 is the min."}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!!!!  I'm only giving one star because the system forces me to in order to post this.  Went to this location last night I ordered wings and the Louisiana Gumbo.  After a wait of almost 30 minutes the waitress comes over and states they had to redo the wings.  Five minutes later the manager comes over with the gumbo and says here's something to munch on while you wait for the wings (I wanted it to come out WITH the wings).  No real apology was offered just another long wait for wings....and the order was STILL wrong.    We ordered charred wings in two different flavors.  Came out plain and flavorless.  Staff seemed to be irritated when it was brought to their attention.  Manager brought out two bowls of sauce that should have been cooked on the wings and said \"here try this\"!!  I'm not going to go into the fact of having to ask for extra napkins as well as tea refills.  There definitely needs to be some training of staff at this location.  A word to the wise spend your hard earned money some where else."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, food and service. I wish they delivered."}
{"text":"The Salads and Oysters are by far the best I've ever had! What a surprise gem! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Order steak and baked potato. Potato was hard as a rock inside. Told waitress 5 minutes later bring back same potato split in half in a bowl. All they did was microwave it. I asked her if that was what they did. She said yes.. Still was not done. I asked here why would they not give me a new one. She stated they are out. I was sitting by kitchen door and watched at least 7 plates come out with baked potato on them after they brought my back out."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere for the game & great service. Reasonable prices and good food. Incredible beer selection too. Lots of locals & crafts on tap and in bottle."}
{"text":"This 4 star rating is based solely on the charred wings!  I've never gotten anything else!  If you don't know about charred wings, they are hot wings that are cooked/fried, then placed on the grill AFTER being tossed in whatever sauce you want...all in order to give a delicious char on each wing.  I usually get the Tavern Chips to go with them.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Went to this new restaurant on Sunday night, we're finally seated after 45 minutes. Our waiter told us that although there were plenty of empty tables, the kitchen couldn't keep up and that was the reason for the long wait. We ordered our food and it was delivered after a reasonable amount of time. Service was good, and the food was good as well. The salad was excellent. Only problem was miscommunication with our waiter and a bill that was definitely on the high side, particularly for a sports bar. We had one order of chicken tenders, an appetizer, and two salads and with the tip, our bill was almost $50.00. For the money we spent, we could have had a nice steak dinner, and will next time. Prices way too high for the quality and amount of food, I highly doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern is such a great addition to The Met...   Highlights: Outdoor seating--great on a beautiful day, even better when there is live music They offer \"Drink of the Month\" specials that include  liquor and beer options Super busy and it was hard for staff to keep up but never abandoned by the staff.   What I ate/drank:  Chicken Caesar Wrap and the Lick of Sunshine drink: Both were good! My friend had the fish tacos and really enjoyed that too. She also had a beer...and enjoyed it and the price.   One of those places that will stop by throughout the Summer."}
{"text":"Decent food but so freaking loud. Not even worth going back."}
{"text":"We brought a large group of friends from our community, and the evening was wonderful!!! Excellent place to watch any game on the big screens and chill environment. The appetizers are delicious, particularly the chipachos (nachos used with potato chips instead of tortilla chips). They have a huge beer list and also source local brews. The staff are welcoming and very accommodating with our large group! Will definitely be back here as a family.W"}
{"text":"Have been frequenting this location for years. Recently we have noticed the prices have gone way up and the food quality way down.  Lunch for two kids and one adult over $50 - no alcohol!  $16.75 for chicken tenders and a salad?!?  Very disappointing.   Just not what it used to be and definitely not worth the money!"}
{"text":"We have been to this location 3 times and 2 out of 3 kitchen was so backed up that we waited 40 minutes or more after ordering for food. Left this time without eating. Manager didn't do anything when we brought it to his attention. In fact he seem sarcastic when he commented that we should come again. What a putz.  Other Hickory Tavern locations should worry about this one giving them a bad reputation."}
{"text":"Well, I had hoped this place wold have developed more consistency after being open a while, but it still sucks. Last time we checked in with four people we gave a phone number, and we were given a pager, but even though they could have seated us after fifteen minutes, they let us sit right by the hostess stand for another forty minutes. The girls had written down the cell number wrong, i.e., they didn't think to literally just say our table was ready, or use the pager, or walk two feet and simply gesture. In other words, they didn't want to do their jobs, or didn't care, or both. After that we waited twenty minutes for drinks and apps, and then another half hour for food.  The whole experience took two and a half hours, and the food wasn't nearly good enough to justify that waste of life.  Just avoid this place.  You may get seated in five minutes or an hour depending on how the staff feels, and you may eat inside of one hour depending on the waiter/waitress, and that is one hour from when you sit. You may also be told the wait is forty-five minutes, only to be forced to sit at the group table in the bar, and see entire sections stand empty despite the faux wait the hostess claimed. For a similar experience just order from a drive-thru, take it home and stare at it until you are too disgusted to eat anymore, then throw fifty bucks in the trash."}
{"text":"Always a good spot to catch a game and have some good grub. Can be noisy, even if you are away from the bar, but you are not going to Hickory Tavern for a romantic night out.  Plenty of beer to quench any thirst though."}
{"text":"Visited Hickory Tavern for MY first time and the evening started off amazing! I was really impressed by the atmosphere, and they even had a flat screen in the restroom so you wouldn't miss a moment of the game. The food is incredible, the chicken quesadilla is my FAVORITE menu item! However, the 2 stars are for the service. Upon arrival, my party of three took no time to order; a total of 5 food items and 5 beverages. Our waitress was nice but was very inexperienced and/or had poor training!!! We received our drinks and oysters we ordered as 1 of our 3 appetizers. About 12 minutes later a huge party of about 20 shows up and that's when WE were forgotten! While having great conversation and the game to keep us occupied, 45 minutes had passed and now we were a little pissed because we had received NOTHING else we ordered. The waitress's excuse was the large party (which we figured). She said that their orders had taken over the kitchen. We expressed our understanding but stretched we were there before the crowd and was now growing impatient! After she basically told us she didn't know what she could do, IF she could do anything about it, we asked for the manager. Fortunately the manager expressed her deepest apologies and comped the food we hadn't received which earned the 3rd star! We left later than expected but satisfied!"}
{"text":"I've got a lot of fond memories from Hickory Tavern. It just so happens to be right around the corner from my house, so it's a nice spot to go later in the evening for a chill night.  With all of the TVs and sports paraphernalia it  seems like it'd be a great spot to watch a game, although I've never been during the day. They've got cheap beers and a really laid back and relaxing atmosphere, which I love."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor; eat somewhere else. This is bad bar food. The nachos were some of the worst I ever had. They were soggy chips out of a bag that were topped with mediocre chili and shredded cheese. No thought was put into this dish at all; it looked like something a 5 year old put together. My chicken sandwich had avocados that that were completely brown. I wonder how many days ago they were sliced. I'd rather eat fast food than suffer through food of this quality again."}
{"text":"Bartenders hate their jobs here at hickory tavern. I suggest if you're out having a good time and in search for a drink you skip this joint."}
{"text":"If want a place to go watch a game and have better than most bars for food and real good service...this is the place for sure.  Lots of good TV's, good beer selection at decent prices (specials).  The food is good and sandwiches well above average.  Service has been great every time I have been there.  Casual atmosphere and nicer than most taverns."}
{"text":"After waiting 30 min for a table after being told it would be 15-20, we got a table on the patio which is quite nice. We waited another 15 min before being acknowledged only after we flagged a waitress down. She took our order even though it wasn't her table. We never got our drinks. I went inside to get waters for our table only after 2 out of 3 meals came. We than had to ask 3 waitresses to check on the third meal. Only one, the last one returned to tell us it would be a few more minutes because the ticket times were messed up in the kitchen. She did say she spoke to a manager and they were coming out food. The lobster roll was mediocre at best. My husbands burger didn't come with cheese as discussed in detail about which kind. Finally, my sons food (pasta) arrived after we had long finished our meals. We never saw a server again. The food is not great. The service was the worst I have ever experienced. The restaurant was half full and I could except mistakes but it would have been nice for a manager of server to follow up with us. We never got mad, just asked multiple times for my sons food because no one even noticed we were eating and he wasn't. I would never come back here or recommend to anyone. In fact, I will let the hotel concierge to not recommend again as well. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I went to this location and had a nightmare of a time, when I complain to the local manager, he never even said sorry, I put a BBB complaint in, the owner contacted me for all the Hickory Taverns, and in his words that I will never forget or stop telling people.  \"YOU ARE JUST ONE PERSON AND WE DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK\"  All I asked for was an official apology and to replace the meal that was ruined.  There is no way I will ever go back to Hickory Tavern and as far as me being just one person, well sorry to tell that Manager but I ran Meetin.org for charlotte and now run Meetup groups with 1000s of people, you bet they are all hearing about it and everyone else.  Owner thinks it matters not what he does to his customers, he owns all the locations around Charlotte."}
{"text":"Fun bar close to the city. Lots of tvs and a lot of beer options. Big local beer selection which is great. I also think the food is good as typical bar food. Recommend the nachos but ask them to put buffalo sauce on chicken instead of bbq sauce. It's amazing. Only negative is parking in the worst parking garage in the city across the street so save yourself some trouble and park at Wendy's or the bottom part of the target parking deck and walk across the street."}
{"text":"First timein. Last time. Not impressed.  Started off with waitress not knowing what an import draft was I. E. Sam Adams , Goose Island. Hello. Any training going on here.  No enthusiasm.  Ordered wings steak Philly my wide ordered chicken salad sandwich. Wings had no sauce on them. Steak Philly was terrible.  Minced meat on a roll not much cheese. Wifes chicken salad was huge chunks of chicken. No seasoning. Oh yeah onion rings were hard as a brick. How Fricken hard is it to make Orings from scratch?  Been in this businesses 35+yrs. It's amazing how you can serve crap and still pack the place. Oh yeah the manager never came over to say a word to us or any other table. But he did have time to ST and schmooze one guest for 15 minutes.  Never again."}
{"text":"Unimpressive flavor for appetizers and sandwich. Expensive beers  Nice responsive staff and attractive building with lots of tvs"}
{"text":"Nice place for a sportsbar, but a bit pricy.  They do have a decent crab legs special sometimes, but it's not worth the price still.  I would go somewhere else if you are looking for something other than overpriced bar food and lots of tv's"}
{"text":"Poor experience this time.  15 min wait turned into 45 when they lost my name.  Dinner took extra long and my salad came out 10 mins after my dinner."}
{"text":"French dip and grilled buffalo chicken sandwich were excellent. Staff was superb and have no complaints. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been to Hickory Tavern 3 times now.  All 3 times, during lunch.  1st time @ Mallard Creek - 2 people - build your own salad.  Impressive and thoughtful menu item.  Great options.  Kudos for this.  The cucumber wasabi dressing is amazing.  2nd time @ Harris - group of 8 - burger and fries.  Meh.  Pretty standard fare bar food.  At least the beer was cold.  3rd time (16SEP2014) @ Harris went something like this - 3 people.  11:15 - get seated by greeter, total of 5 customers in the restaurant.  11:20 - people around us are getting their drink and food orders taken, some of these people came in after us, we have not been greeted by a server.  11:30 - drinks and food start hitting tables around us.  11:35 - still not greeted by a server, so we stood up and left.  As we left, I made eye contact with the bartender, I'm sure anger and disappointment was over my face.  I don't have a shred of tolerance when it comes to being ignored in a restaurant.  I make it a rule to avoid places that disappoint me like the plague, poor service being the worst offense.  There are many options in Charlotte for places to have lunch, this one is off the table for me.  If you don't want to send a server to my table, you can't have my business."}
{"text":"The wings with a small Tavern salad always a good choice. This is their specialty and what I will order in the future, however I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak once for variety--it was horrible. A small sandwich with overcooked  processed meat--order the wings.  Finally don't order the large order(10 count) wing, it does not come with a side (the salad) and you end up spending double. The entree has 8 wings and includes the side."}
{"text":"I have been twice and not impressed either time. I went for the lobster roll and the 1st time they were out so tried the grilled salmon. It was greasy and over seasoned and had no flavor other than salt. The 2nd time did get the lobster roll. The positive was the lobster portion was nice and not to much mayo. The negative to much celery and over seasoned with ?  I could not identify.  Whatever was added had and aftertaste. A good lobster roll needs only mayo a little salt, pepper, celery (optional) and lemon juice along with the lobster. That along wit the noisy atmosphere, I say no need to go back."}
{"text":"Really disappointing service.  Probably the worst I can remember.  I was with a group on a Saturday night.  The crowd was probably normal for a Saturday.  Not 100% full but busy. We sat on the patio for a total of 3 hours.  I would estimate we saw our waitress a total of 4 or 5 times (counting her introduction).  We did manage to get a burger and 2 beers.  One member of the party who arrived after the others asked her to come back for a food order - she never did. At the end of the evening we had to track down the manager to ask for our tab.  He generously gave us a 20% discount off our tab.  (In retrospect we should have walked out after waiting an hour with no tab to pay).  I will make it a point not to stop by again.  Too bad. It's a very convenient restaurant since we live nearby."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good prices, fast ordering and food coming. The mushroom onion Swiss on sourdough was delicious, juicy and flavorful. The French fries are amazing! Crunchy and fresh. The California chicken burger is super delicious too! The cedar salmon is top notch, juicy and flavorful. This restaurant is definitely recommend, their food is good, about $10 per burger. :)"}
{"text":"I do not share the excitement of Rebekah for this place.  Why is it a sports bar has to look weathered, dirty and old.  I swear people design these places trying to make it look like it has been there forever. Okay, so that is the decor which is just so... well... un-exciting and predictable. The food.  Hmmm... see above.  un-exciting and predictable. Service was okay.  The staff seems engaged and want to do a good job but I swear (and I know I am harping back on the decor) the decor sucks the life out of you.  Where is the energy?  Excitement?  When I look for a place to catch a game, I want a good TV, lots to view at, good food (doesn't have to be great, just good), cold beer and servers that care and try.  I will end up trying this again because of friends driving me there... but not my top choice."}

{"text":"Both times I've been here I've had to wait forever for cold food & gotten bad service. Dont waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! I am regretfully having to write this being a server myself for 10 years, as was the other two dining with me. That being said, during our a meal a group of clearly over served people were being incredibly loud and rude and drawing inappropriate images in the condensation on the windows of the restaurant , a girl from this group then proceeded to shoulder bump an employee and started cursing at the employee using racial slurs and slamming her beer on table, this happened literally 2feet from our table we had to go in and search for management meanwhile being cursed and yelled at by the drunk girl who has now started to try and physically assault people  as well as her belligerent boyfriend, our meal was not discounted in any way the manager did virtually nothing to diffuse the situation we took half our meals to go , only to learn on our way out the door that the drunkard , Nicole Edwards , is actually an employee of that hickory tavern who was off duty and drinking to excess .... This was a ridiculous experience that's poor management and poor judgment on the part of the bartender who served someone to that extent. Our 4th of July was ruined and we will never be back."}
{"text":"The place was very crowed. Which tells you the place is good. However that also means slow service. We had to flag down someone three times. Salads were forgotten and brought while we were eating dinner. Staff are friendly but forgetful."}
{"text":"Great steak and service. Manager and two servers came by to be sure everything was ok.  No complaints plus steak was cooked too please a steak snob."}
{"text":"Good California Chix sandwich and Carolina Burger.  They serve sandwiches \"dry\", so you have to add condiments.  And they are shy with the ketchup!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant, fast service, tasty food. Friendly wait staff and hostesses. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The service was excellent! The food was great. I loved the atmosphere. Everybody spoke when you walked in. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Do NOT ever go to the Hickory Tavern on Harris!! I'm so embarrassed for their managers. After having been pushed to order multiple beers (not that I minded this part that much) my server then told me to leave my card on the table and he would just get it (without being given my check). I decided to see what would happen so I did. He brought me back my receipt without my check. I then asks for my itemized check and he acted like he didn't know what I was talking about. I explained what it was to him then he brought it. Guess what!! It was lower than what he ran my card for?! Seriously!! Don't go there! They let their servers TRY to rip you off!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Ordered a rueben and fries. Food was hot and delivered quickly. Server was on point. Was in and out in about 30 minutes. Will definitely stop back in if I'm ever in that neighborhood again."}
{"text":"Poor service. Sat at a hightop table in the bar, left after no one came to take my order. Several staff walked by me and it wasn't until I started to walk out someone approached me"}
{"text":"I've only been here about 4 times over 5 years but not once slow service or bad food. Every time for me has been a good experience. The restaurant is very nice and clean."}
{"text":"This place was a train wreck. We were twice brought dishes that did not belong to our table. When we asked for extra napkins (because three of us had gotten wings) they seemed baffled and brought us a roll of paper towels. There were no wet-wipes either, and requests for such were also met with bafflement. And offers to bring us a wet rag. The waits between visits from our server reached upwards of 20 minutes. We were here for over two hours, and not by choice.  The wings were okay. My burger was pretty good. The general consensus in our party is that the food was okay. But certainly not worth the frustration."}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times and I believe that I am a gluten for punishment. Absolutely the worst Hickory Tavern that We have been to.   Food is terrible no matter what you order and they can't even get you beer order correct. Which in my opinion is sacrilege for a place with Tavern in their name.   Finally, the service is also terrible. Be prepared for you sever to be rude and disappear for long periods of time.   Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. Lucky a new one is open in Indian Trail. I have been there three times. The service and food are great."}
{"text":"Went to eat lunch before a shopping trip to Trader Joe's. We have eaten at a hickory tavern before and have never been disappointed, until now. Upon walking in the greet was ok, then we were sat down to wait close to 10 minutes until we had to ask for a waitress. Keep in mind, it was a very slow time there. Barely anyone was there. Then we ordered our drink and food together with the waitress being somewhat nice. Got our food, and it was not great. Got refills and we were still nice and said thank you. No response from the waitress. Finished our food, put our jackets on and pushed our plates to the side. The waitress walked past us about 3 times before coming to acknowledge that we were done. Needless to say,  bad service and ok food. I'm sorry but this is what ruins businesses. Disrespectful workers."}
{"text":"Sad Excuse For A Sports Bar.  Manager should be FIRED.  To not play the Duke game on the day Coach K was going for number 1000?????  Really?  To then refuse to turn on the volume....on a day of NCAA Historical Significance????  Really???    To turn away over $450 on a day when the bar and booths/tables were practically empty????  Really???  I've been going to Hickory Tavern since it was a dive bar on Hwy 127 in Hickory.  I've spend Thousands of Dollars there over the past 14 years.    But alas.....NO MORE!!!!!!  I will go to a real Sports Fan Sports Bar.  The food at HT has declined...it's typical frozen breaded fried dribble now.  Commercial Food is a compliment.  Oh...and I wrote a long very clear explanation, on the HT website, of the service and treatment we received on that day...and You guessed it......NO RESPONSE.  They lost Thousands of Future Dollars and after we left (6 of us) and went to another Sports Fan Friendly Bar....we spend almost $500 between Tab and Tips."}
{"text":"I have been to three Hickory Taverns, but this was the best one. Our server was very prompt and the restaurant was immaculate--not so much with the other two. They must have one heck of a manager at this one, because each time we've been there, everything from the restrooms to the silverware has been sparkling. I LOVE their fish tacos. They are fresh and filling. The pico must be house-made because it's really crisp. My husband likes their burgers, and the little honey rolls they serve with their salads are awesome. The soft pretzels are delicious and fresh, and the dipping sauces are so good. Sometimes the vegetable sizes are hit or miss in terms of preparation, but overall they are generally good. This location is more low-key than the one in Gastonia, where the noise level and TV overload are pretty overwhelming. Glad we have a location near us now!"}
{"text":"Fun place to bring a group of soccer players. Lots of TVs and good atmosphere. It took a while to get our food, but it was 8pm on a Saturday night and the place was packed. The tavern chips are excellent. The California chicken sandwich was good but the bun was so soggy I couldn't pick it up - had to use a knife and fork."}
{"text":"It's not hard to get Nachos wrong, but they did. So disappointed in this Hickory Tavern. Came to watch football but could hardly hear anything over the outrageously loud crowd. Service was pretty bad as well.. Waited ten minutes just to get our check so we could go watch the game elsewhere."}
{"text":"Enjoy having this restaurant in this small community.  The food is consistently decent.  Would like to see more attractive beer and food specials, to make it affordable to visit more frequently.  Burgers, Wings, Salads, and Seafood in a clean and lively atmosphere.  Very clean kitchen and safe food handling practices."}
{"text":"I haven't been In hickory tavern in quite a while.... Thought I would try it again. Well the server was not attentive at all, the food came out and the bun on a chicken sandwich was soaking wet. I sent it back and the manager came over 10 min later to ask if I wanted anything else, I would have thought that it would have been quicker than that. The server gave us the check before we were done which I thought was strange. She never came over to refill our drinks but was sure she gave us the check. That was a surprise but the biggest surprise was the bill, a burger and two teas came to over $17 which was very surprising. I won't be back"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere in the bar area.  I haven't really done sit down service in the restaurant part.  Nice place to have a beer and watch a game.  Decent food.  Usually mostly men in there.  Have outdoor seating also.  One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"I like this place. The main reason for that is because it is authentic: it is not trying to be something that it isn't.   It's on the way to my house so I stop here for happy hour sometimes and a quick bite to eat with friends after work. Nice sports-bar type atmosphere, friendly wait staff, good bar food and a great bar with tons of TV's.   Wouldn't necessarily be my first choice to take out the family for dinner (although there are a lot of families every time I'm there) but for hanging out with the boys over some wings and brew while watching a game it's a great place!"}
{"text":"Great wings and I highly recommend the fiesta salad.  The waitstaff was very attentive, and the manager (George) even stopped by to make sure we were comfortable.  Ask for the cinnamon toast shots!"}
{"text":"To be fair I did not eat there today.  The hostess sat us at a little table between two large softball teams and when I asked for a quieter table she seemed annoyed.  The hostess then moved us to a booth and just before we sat down the server came by and told the hostess \"I am not taking them\" What did the hostess do next?  You guessed it, moved us back to a table next to the two softball teams.  Then we left."}
{"text":"Average average average. It's just your average place the food is good not great but it's expensive. Not great parking but it could be a lot worse. Make sure you don't bring a pick up truck there because last time I got keyed out in the parking lot people there do not like pick up trucks so be careful y'all"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good wait staff, terrible food!   Because I love the atmosphere ( TV sets, bar scene, outdoor seating) , I really want to like this place. But I've been five or six times and haven't had a decent meal yet. I order something different every time in hopes that I'll finally find something that taste good. But even after getting advice from the wait staff I have yet to find anything that tastes really good. If I ever go back again it will only be to have drinks. No more dining there!"}
{"text":"What happened to my Hickory Tavern?  My kids were home from school break and we wanted to watch the Carolina game. As we have many times, we chose Hickory Tavern. Although the restaurant was not full, we waited 25 minutes for a table in the dining room vs bar area as we were all eating. When we were seated, there were still numerous tables which had not been cleared or cleaned. Even our booth still had trash and debris on the floor. We ordered drinks and appetizers which took almost 30 minutes to receive. The server was a sweet young girl but didn't really seem to care about the delays or mess. We ordered the Korean bbq tacos which were ice cold. Mgr stopped by with usual walk & wave, so I asked her if they were meant to be cold as it wasn't mentioned on the menu. She responded yes and asked if we liked them. We said no, but she shrugged and walked away. We didn't eat the tacos, but did enjoy sharing wings. So 75 minutes and $100 later we decided this was our last visit. There are so many choices in the area we would rather visit other restaurants."}
{"text":"Lots of nice TVs for the games, but service is always awful and the food is way overpriced. Patio has a view of the road or the parking lot, your choice! Save your money and eat a sandwich in your car."}
{"text":"My family ate here for the first time recently. The server was friendly, the place was clean and family friendly. Separate bar area with TVs for the sports fans. They had a lot of people at the bar even though it was a Wed night and the place was fairly busy. Husband got a cheeseburger and fries, that was really GOOD! They cooked it medium but just barely as they knew he liked it medium rare. The kids meal was a great deal, macaroni and cheese with a side of baked potato. My kids were able to split it so it was perfect! I ordered the Mediterranean chicken flat bread. It was sort of like a pizza with balsamic marinated chicken, olives, onions, and feta. My only criticism is it really needed some mozzarella and just a hint of feta. Instead it had no mozzarella at all and the only cheese on it was feta. TONS of feta. I scraped most of it off and left it on my plate. Don't get me wrong it was still delicious, but with no melt-able cheese to hold everything together it was a little hard to eat and everything kept falling off. And that much feta is just too strong. But I ate it all and left only the excess feta on the plate. So there! ha ha. Also my food came out wrong the first time and had to be remade. It would have been nice if someone told the manager. he popped by our table to see if we were \"all right\" and I was sitting there with no food. We told him we were fine (which we were) but when he first popped over I thought it was to say sorry that they made my food wrong, but he seemed to have no idea and was just doing a routine check in with all the tables. it was no big deal, as mistakes happen in the kitchen and they fixed it right away. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a sports bar and grill. We just flew into Charlotte for the weekend.  They have a great draft beer selection, our favorite was the Hickory Ruby Red lager! We had lunch there today,  and a late night drink last night. Our food was delicious, try Linda's turkey sandwich. The service was fast and very friendly.  Very clean bathrooms.  Inexpensive.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great bartenders, good drink specials."}
{"text":"Server was inattentive. Wings ordered never came out. Manager kept saying the wings were on the way, but I watched three servers take other wing orders to customers while still waiting for my order. The restaurant smelled funky as if carpet was wet and never cleaned. Food was marginal at best. Two star rating is generous!"}
{"text":"Hostesses were inconvenienced by us walking in. Never offered us a high chair for the 16 month old.  Waitress was nice. However, repeat drink order was wrong. She never asked if we needed anything else after dropping off the food.  Ketchup would've been nice with the burger. She never checked to see if we liked the food. The baby got fussy so we got our coats on and waited with credit card out on table for her return.  She was nice by offering a box for my food but I needed another for my other kids food. So more waiting with an unhappy baby. Food was edible but I can't imagine going back."}
{"text":"took the opportunity to visit the Hickory Tavern with my wife this evening..And I must say was not disappointed...we have been frequently making excuses to eat out and we have always been pleased with the menu selections, the service, the ambiance and just a great place to dine...the flatbread was very good, and my wife's chicken wings once again put a smile on her face just as they've done a bunch of times before. Our waitress this time, her name was Regan was knowledgeable, accommodating and was always there to make sure our drinks had a refill...My wife and I now go to this restaurant WHENEVER we go out to eat...just a wonderful experience...kudos to the management there at this location..."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to this Hickory Tavern since they first opened..and the one we both can say, thank heaven there's a restaurance in the Union County area, that's a fun place to go to, and on top of that the service and food are top of the line...we have always gotten a waiter or waitress that is pleasant, willing to go overboard in the service category and serves us great food...this is the only place that we go to eat out in Union...."}
{"text":"Yikes. One of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. Came in on not very busy Friday (tonight). Service was slow and unattentive food was cold and just not good when it finally arrived. Even the beer tasted off. I'll be shocked if they're still in business next year. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Best location! Great service - Thanks Jason! Food was awesome! My favorite is the cedar salmon and Brussel Sprouts - I get it at every HT.  The salmon was excellent and the sprouts were crispy and cooked very tender.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"I eat here 3-4 times a month, always great service, great food.  I have not ordered a bad thing yet.  My only complaint is the sandwiches are usually wet on the bottom.  I can overlook that based on the whole package.  Can get very loud when busy....poor acoustics.  Lots of TVs to see your favorite channel.  I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"Seemed like we waited a while for our tavern chips but the manager brought them out... said he didn't like the looks of the first batch and made them do over. Worth it. They were hot and crisp and great. Our chicken tenders and wings were awesome. The place was loud and packed with Sunday football fans. Way better than than the HT we have at home!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here. Quesadilla for me and a burger for my husband. Waitress Danyelle was very friendly.  Food was good. We would definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern has always been an up and down experience for me, but recently they have came a long way with their food. I've noticed probably about  two months or so ago they changed their menu a little bit and added the \"build your own salad\" concept. I love it! The salad options are out of this world and it arrives in a perfect portion tin bowl (to keep it cold). The salad is chopped all together with the dressing mixed in. The options are amazing because you are able to create so many different varieties of salads. Other than their salad options, I have eaten their burgers, chicken sandwiches, and wings. I have never had any issue with their food and for a bar type atmosphere, differently recommended. They have more T.V's than any bar I have ever been too, so watching a game is never a problem. One problem is the service. We always tend to sit at the bar because the servers take forever to come by the tables. Other than that, I love it! I'm about to move to Orlando and I will miss my Hickory Tavern food!"}
{"text":"BEST BURGER! Went with family and everyone loved everything. The wings were also good. The fries are awesome as well. Service was satisfactory. Our waitress was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. The place is clean and has a relaxed vibe. Will be eating here often once I move back here in a few months."}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't rely on the posted reviews. I'm on vacation and the greeters at the door were fantastic and our server rocked it tonight. Was quite knowledgeable about the drink and food menu. When I visit again this place will definitely be on my must go to list."}
{"text":"Worst service ever (and I do write all kinds of reviews, not just bad ones).  I ordered my regular cocktail at the bar- a bloody mary. After literally four minutes, I got my drink and couldn't even detect vodka in the drink (the bar was empty- guessing she had to look up how to make the drink??).   After inquiring to the bartender about a weak yet really really tomatoey spicey drink (completely undrinkable), she said she was instructed to make it that way (one literal measured single shot of vodka in a 24oz tumbler..talk about tomato overload! Most bloody's are at least 25% booze),  She told us we'd have to buy a shot to make the drink stronger. So we did, but the single shot (literally one ounce-- no more, as measured as the cocktail was) of rail vodka was more expensive than the horrible cocktail. It didn't make a dent to this tomato explosion.  After speaking again with the bartender (a horribly snotty highschool girl) about obviously having different expectations for a cocktail, and asked if maybe we could just have a beer instead. She shook her head, shrugged and said sorry, then walked away.  Furious, we paid with a waitress and left to go call a manger since he \"wasn't available\" when we were in the building. After ten minutes on hold, we called back. Another five minutes on hold. The third call back (over an hour) we finally got a hold of him.  After lots of discussion, he finally refunded our $20 after much convincing that no matter how many free appetizers he could possibly offer, we would never return.  EDIT: Weird, that credit never ended up on my card. Shocking right??? What a rackett. The inept leading the inept.  The staff at this location makes the bar AWFUL. Along with being overpriced, I will never visit any other Hickory Tavern location.  Tons of awesome bars around the area, with way nicer bartenders with slightly caring management. Jerks."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time at HT. The beer list was great, lots if options. Being a vegetarian it is usually hard to find things to eat at a place like HT. Me and my boyfriend both ordered the veggie burger with additional toppings, for lack of a better word it was, mediocre.  I do need to point out the staff though. It just so happens that the host we should of had was an ex of my bf (I'm not putting names). Anyway, she made a big deal about us being there. Hid in the back and made us feel like we weren't welcome. It took at least 7 minutes to get greeted then seated. After 5 years you would think she would be over it.    Needless to say we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Korean BBQ tacos were cold.  Manager said it was the kimchi on top of the beef, but it was not a case of a cold condiment atop a warm entree.  Chicken wing drumsticks were semi-raw.    The draft beer selection maybe had three craft beers.  The rest were Bud, Yuenling and that sort.  Too many other places with wider and deeper draft selection."}
{"text":"The ribeye was great! Waitress haley was nice."}
{"text":"nice staff some pretty good wings. ..burgers are better than their burger restaurant a big plus"}
{"text":"Best bar food I've had in a while hands down. A group of us went here last night for some food, drinks and college football. Wait time was phenomenal (5 minutes) considering we came at 9 pm. Service was quick, accurate, friendly, and not too pushy.  6 beers and 2 dinners (with tip) was $45. Cant beat that! I had the BYO salad with rare tuna and my bf had a burger and tavern chips.  My only complaint was the nachos were too salty, but that was easily remedied with a napkin."}
{"text":"We had my Mother's Birthday Party here on 10/29/16. What a Great time we all had. The food, music and waiters were Great!!! Thanks Lyles!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times so far and it's by far the best!  Love it!  Especially with Ashley! She is amazing!  Total gem and I would request her from now on.  She is beyond great!"}
{"text":"I like Hickory Tavern, but not this location. The 2 guys that walk around to check on you do not even hear you if you have an issue. On 2 occasions, there has been a problem with the food. The first time, it was corrected, but only after we had to ask for help 2 times. He acted like it was an inconvenience The 2nd time, my Mom's fish was awful. When she told him, he said OK, and walked away. I will go to a different location from now on."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful experience and will not be coming back again. Our family goes to this location once a week and always orders the same thing. Long story short, our server was beyond horrible with the worst attitude and informed our table she was a server not a servant. I could go on and on about the rude remarks she made to our table. Management handled extremely poorly all over a child being over 10 who wasn't very hungry and wanted the kids chicken fingers. What happened to making your customers happy and since when do servers pick arguments with customers?"}
{"text":"Me and couple of friends went to this restaurant  to watch the Panthers vs Seahawks football game.  The restaurant was packed with 85% to 90% African Americans.  The restaurant had a waiting list and we was waiting for a table to come available.  As we was waiting to be seated,  an unknown white couple came to me and my colleague and advised that they vacated a table in the bar area and we can have it.  Our stay at that table was short live, we were advised by a RUDE BLONDE waitress, advised that the table reserved a white couple  and we needed to get up now. We got up and we started talking to some of our friends at a nearby table. The general manager approach me and my friends and advised us stop \"hovering over the white customer's table and we needed to go back up front now or he was going to call the police.  The general manager didn't want hear that we was talking to our friends at a nearby table and not \"hovering over\" the the white couple's table.  The general manager called the police after requested his name and a business card to file a complaint.   We spoke with the police on the outside of the restaurant and advised them what happened and the officers could not believe that they were called out to Hickory Tavern Harris Corners Pkwy for that bogus call.   The general manager over reacted to a couple law a biding customers that was trying to watch the Panthers vs Seahawks football game.  I will never patronized with Hickory Tavern again until they make this right with me and my friends. 5 thumbs down!   I reluctantly use the race card, however, I truly believe that myself and my friends race, African American,  was determining and deciding factor as why the general manager elected to call the police.   I am not sure what management training the general manager went through to prepare him for that role, however,  he failed in a major way. Question: If me and my friends was white, would the general manager would have called the police?????"}
{"text":"Rude servers expensive  average quality food. Not a good place for kids to go eat but parents bring them anyway, its like a zoo inside with lots of tv's and hostess are rude also. I just wanna write this as how my experience is from the beginning to the end of my visit."}
{"text":"Decent food and nice atmosphere.  The shrimp tacos were pretty good.  The waiter could be better.  He took forever to check up on us and walked on by without giving us refills, twice.  It was annoying trying to get his attention when he seemed more focused on his coworkers and just walking around to talk."}
{"text":"As I write this review, I've been waiting for a table for 45 minutes but am looking at a half empty restaurant.  This location of Hickory Tavern has just opened and the management apparently wasn't prepared.  I've been told that the kitchen staff \"doesn't know the menu yet\" and is backed up, and so they're delaying seating for 45 minutes to allow the kitchen to catch up.  I anticipate the kitchen manager and GM will both be getting a pink slip after this weekend!  Major fail."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. There is no better place to watch football and the food has never been bad."}
{"text":"I'm currently sitting at this location. It is not busy, granted it is a Sunday. We have had arguably the worst service possible. 10 minutes to see our waitress. 25 to get our drinks. We ordered wings, very good and came out after only 30 minutes. When they came out we ordered our food, 65 minutes later we asked where our burgers were. Waitress never apologized then brought our burgers out without fries. Again no apology. Then our fries came out 5 minutes after. Our \"early dinner\" had turned into a 2.5 hour ordeal for one beer, an order of wings, and a burger. Oh and my water glass had a receipt in it. Wow this is bad."}
{"text":"Food is good here and they always seem to have my favorite draft craft beer here. Their chocolate cake is so good. Need a gallon of milk to go with it. It is for those addicted to chocolate."}
{"text":"We really enjoy going here before the movie next door.   Wine is always good and the barbecue chicken nachos are one of our favorites my grandson days the burgers are great. I was dieting and got the make your own salad and it is always great.  They have specials too. Just wish they would put one tv on foodnetwork or something besides sports."}
{"text":"I used to work here and they made a point for service to be meticulous. I guess not anymore?Last time I went my server was noo good! Not really polite, just sorta there....and that was it. I even watched her with other customers and they didn't look too happy either. I never even got her name...her introduction was simply \"what can I get you to drink?\" As a server myself, I know you can get busy and she was but not checking on us kinda put a damper on me wanting to order more food. I ended up getting it to-go. I was not impressed at all.  The chicken wings were great though. And the manager (younger out-going lady) made the visit much more tolerable!"}
{"text":"Won't be returning, kept thinking they need a visit from Chef Ramsey to help them focus on quality vs quantity.  Shrimp n Grits is a huge portion, but it's just a huge pile of mush with overcooked shrimp and way too much cheese.  None of my family of 4 liked their meals.  My Son had pizza that is advertised to remind you of school pizza - why would that be a good thing?  It definitely lived up to it's billing, he took 2, maybe 3 bites.  No wonder the restaurant was 1/4 full, while the bbq restaurant across the way was slammed on 7/4 eve.  Makes you wonder how they pay the rent, but I do see some who rate it 5 stars, so maybe I'm missing something..."}
{"text":"I ate here twice with a group and loved the salad as you choose what you want on it and it it's cut the way you want so you don't end up with lettuce hanging out of your mouth and I added salmon of course. The atmosphere was casual too me like a noisy dorm group room with all the tv's going. Little pricy for every day but worth the money. It is one place for me to consider for Super Bowl Sunday."}
{"text":"Okay, we've been back several times since I posted my last review.  Service is much, much better and food seems to be more consistent.  I'm very glad to see the improvements!"}
{"text":"What's with Hickory Taverns always being so dark inside, regardless of how bright it is outside? Maybe it's an attempt to contribute to a \"Tavern feel\" but at this small Hickory Tavern off Charlotte Hwy in Indian Land, it's almost depressing.   The food here is good, and the service has been solid on multiple visits so far. Nothing to blow your socks off, however. I don't have any particular \"go to\" menu items at Hickory Tavern because nothing stands out as \"so delicious I want to come back for that\". I like to order the steak sandwich and then decompose it and eat it as a steak with bread and fries. I also have tried their lobster roll a few times. It's a passable lobster salad, and will do in a fix, but there are (thankfully) better ones in Charlotte these days!  This is one of the few restaurants where I can feel comfortable ordering unsweet tea, knowing that it won't be bitter. They do a good job with their tea brewing. Hey, maybe THAT'S my \"go to\", their unsweet iced tea!  Better for lunch than dinner, given how packed it can get in the evenings. If you're in the area and looking for a sports bar, Hickory Tavern's probably the best option for a few miles."}
{"text":"Enjoyed patio dining at lunch today.  The turkey wrap with apple cider vinegarette and sweet tater fries are so very good.  Service was wonderful from our server to the manager making sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. The way my husband and I were treated by the manager \"Matt\" was deplorable.                                We placed a carryout at 8:30 Sat. night, simple order, steak sandwich no onions and mushroom swiss no pink. Side salad and a slice of cheesecake. Husband calls in order, drives up there, waits at bar for 20 mins., drives back home. Onions all over the steak sandwich and an almost raw mushroom swiss burger. Call restaurant, talks to Manager Matt, Matt offers a $10 credit  toward our next visit or we could drive back up there and get another sandwich. Hmmm...after paying $40.00 for two sandwiches, a side salad and a slice of cheesecake we shouldn't have to drive back up there, or eat raw meat and onions. So we decided this is not right, we were not going to eat what we did not order, (it was printed on the order ticket correctly), so my  husband takes the sandwiches and side salad back to the manager and ask for a full refund and we would pay for the cheesecake.                                         Manager Matt agreed and didn't charge for the cheesecake. Matt tells the husband money would be credited back in 3-5 days. Being reasonably perturbed by this time, and almost 10:00 at night and no dinner, my husband replies, \"Yeah, I know. I don't think you handled this situation very well.\" Matt immediately becomes defensive and said, \"What? I gave you your money back! We do make mistakes. Nobody is perfect.\"           My husband responds, \"No their not, but it's YOUR job to correct the mistakes. Did you expect me to eat a cold, raw sandwich after I drove back up here to get the right sandwich for my wife?\" Then as he is walking out the door, Manager Matt follows him to the door and yells out to my husband,                                                   \"Enjoy that cheesecake I just bought you!!!\" The very cheesecake my husband said he keeping and would pay for.                       So.... my husband drives back home AGAIN to pick up the cheesecake and take it back to Manager Matt. He walks in and hands the cheesecake over to the hostess, she asked what was wrong with the cheesecake, my husband tells her he didn't want the cheesecake after what the manager did as he was walking out the door. Manager Matt walks up during the conversation with the hostess and says,     \"I bought you the cheesecake for your trouble.\" My husband tells him, \"Don't want your cheesecake, don't need your cheesecake, and that was nothing more than an F-you as I was walking out the door!\" He ask for the managers name, and walks out of that place for the LAST time, and says, \"Have a nice night Matt!\" The other employees were kind and apologized, but the cook can't read the orders, and Manager Matt has no customer service skills at all and made it his mission that we wouldn't come back. After 2 hours of going back and forth to Hickory Tavern 3 times, we ate cereal for dinner and will be waiting 3-5 days to get our $40 back.  Thanks for the memories Matt!"}
{"text":"This is a great place.  In fact, it's the \"go to\" place for the group of friends we hang out with usually.    The pros include the people (meaning a fantastic crowd on most nights), the food has always been good (wings, burgers, quesadilla, nachos, sliders, etc.), a great selection of beers, and a ton of tv's to catch the game from every seat.  The cons include a little of the decore issue William mentioned.  Yes, it's a little predictable.  Also, it's not the cheapest bar you'll find.  Basically though, we don't go to bars/restaurants to enjoy the decor on the walls.  They're not trying to be some quaint joint that attracts a specific eclectic demographic.  This is a large suburban bar who attracts a broader spectrum of customer.  They do it right.  We go for the gathering of old friends and to meet new friends.  We also go to eat, drink and catch a game.  Regarding the prices, if you don't want to spend $4 for a beer, there are many other places in South Charlotte, but you won't get what you get here.  I've actually frequented their location on Providence Rd. many times as well.  Neighter location calls themself a sports bar, but they're the best sports bar near where I live.  In summary, I recommend it as a casual hangout with friends to eat, drink and catch a game."}
{"text":"I usually go for their oysters, both steamed and raw, have always been good, fresh, and generously sized. They no longer served their steamed oysters with the annoying tape on each one like they used to, I hated that.  The downside for me is their very limited selection of IPA beer, and since only drink IPA, that's a downer, but they do have a good selection of drinks.  Nice local pub,  but I think they need a better craft beer menu to go with their oysters, if they did I would go more often."}
{"text":"The kitchen cant coordinate a ticket. Service is okay, if you dont mind waiting an hour and reminding them multiple times. Tried it for the second time after a below average first experience, will not come back."}
{"text":"Tonight my family came to the restaurant to celebrate Mother's Day. We were a party of 7. We got here at 5:30 pm to beat the crowd. We had our son from Arizona fly in, as a Surprise, Mom fm Fla, my & Hubby fm GA. This a special night. We were told it would be 20 mins for a table. We were told a hi-top table was available, but we had a disabled person that could not sit there. We were offered a booth that seats 6. We have 7 people. That will not work either since we were told we could not add a chair to the end of the table. 30 mins later other groups as large as ours were seated we were again told our options. There were regular tables open for us, but they filled them so this option was taken away from us. The hi-top was out, the booth we were willing to try was not available. By now it has been 1 hour. We we were willing to try the booth, but we were told if it did not work we would have to go back on the wait list again. Nobody checked on us. We chose to leave. Worst service we ever had. We have been customers here for many years. Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"I think this is a good one. I think the worst thing I experienced here was undercooked chips and really tough chicken. Keep in mind this was a one time thing out of many, many times I have been here. I don't reccomend sitting at the circular tables as they sit weird and my friend's playe almost slipped right off the table onto his lap. Other than that the staff is really great. The atmosphere is nice too. The food is good too."}
{"text":"This place is probable only good for drinks - their food service is terrible and horrible slow.  I don't think their kitchen knows the first think about customer wait times and satisfaction levels."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out for the first time after hearing how good it was. From the moment we walked in the door till the time we left, the service was great. The hostesses were friendly and our waitress, Cat, was phenomenal. The food was really tasty and I think I was served a baked potato as big as my head! I recommend the Chicken Colorado which is chicken with bacon and BBQ sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"So I have been to Hickory Tavern many many times before. I am actually suprised I havent reviewed it until now. The view of the city is incredible and it is conveniently located in the Met, so we usually hit it before a Trader Joe's grocery shopping trip!   Usually my husband and I get the Build Your Own Salads. 6 ingredients for $9. The oriental dressing is amazing and bacon and avocado on a salad is just A-mazing. In addition, I love that Hickory has Red Oak on tap. They have alot of local beers on draft and I love that about a restaurant.  However, this review is more specifically directed to a situation we had today for lunch at HT. My husband and I decided to grab our typical BYO salads. I don't know what was going on but it took a long time to get our food. 25-30 minutes to get a salad is kinda crazy (I mean there wasnt even any cooked meat on it.....all raw ingredients!).Our waitress was super sweet though and came by saying that she had no idea why we hadn't gotten our food yet and that it should be there soon. We finally got our salads and dug in.....yummy dressing! However, about half way into the salad, my husband looks up and pulls out a piece of cardboard from his salad. It was about 2 inches by a half inch. Gross. We have both worked in the food industry and know that those boxes are dragged across the floor when being brought in. All I could picture is that nasty cardboard piece being spread across that whole (since the dressing was tossed into the salad).   The waitress was, once again, very sweet and didnt really know what to do and grabbed her manager. The manager came out and was talking about boxing up the salad to go. I am assuming she was talking about boxing up a new salad and not the one with the cardboard in it....I dont know. She also offered us a free brownie. Honestly, we didnt really want any other food at the time. They did comp his salad (which was very sweet, hence the 2 stars instead of 1) and charged me for mine. It was just kinda weird. I mean she did apologize but it just came across like it wasnt a big deal.   Kinda frustrating that we had this happen cause we LOVED going to Hickory Tavern in the past! I'm not sure if we will be back soon, simply cause I keep picturing that nasty piece of cardboard. Plus, there are so many other places to eat in the Met!"}
{"text":"Nicole and Brandy went above and beyond. Great food, great service and football. What more could you want"}
{"text":"Was initially very excited having a chain Resturant so close to home and then I went there. The beer selection is very large but the menu is not large at all. The food is only so so. The thrill is gone."}
{"text":"Very nice and honest staff! Not only did they stay on the phone with me when I was lost getting there, they returned my ID and another friends wallet in the same night. Great food and drink prices!!!! I would recomennd the salmon!! Only downfall is the mixed drinks are on the weak side...but the bartender has no problem remaking a drink =)"}
{"text":"Food was decent on 12/31/17 visit but beware of ordering premium mixed drinks. A Smooth Manhattan on rocks was ordered, which is made with top shelf liquor. What was produced was a nasty imitation made with \"bar booze\" and cheap liquor. Hickory Tavern had no qualms in charging for the higher quality product. Business needs to either charge accordingly or bartenders need a refresher. When people know their drinks, they know they are being duped. It is not appreciated."}
{"text":"Great place to watch games! Have been twice in past week. Service very good both nights. Love the house made potato chips with ranch, especially when they come out piping hot. Must order those! Chicken sandwich was just meh - chicken was very chewy in the middle and kind of turned me off from eating it. French dip sandwich was VERY good and good quality roast beef. The price for a side salad is a little much ($6.29) for what it is, but at least it comes with a tasty pastry. All in all its a solid restaurant for watching games with a nice, big feel and many big screens."}
{"text":"I went last night to catch the Panthers preseason game and was disappointed. There were multiple tables open in the bar area but they would not allow me to be seated without waiting 20 minutes. This has been an issue the last few times I've been to this location. I've heard a few others complain about the issue as well. The servers even laugh about it saying how ridiculous it is. This place is a sports bar after all, you should be able to walk in and grab a seat if open.  Not the case at all here. Not sure who's grand idea it was to have a wait in a bar that's not full?  It would be worth a 7 minute drive to Ballantyne or Matthews to avoid dealing with ignorance.  I give 2 stars just because I know what they are capable of. I've been going to hickory taverns in Asheville and Ballantyne for a few years now and have enjoyed them. This location doesn't seem to understand how to function properly.  Watching the hostesses freak out the entire time is not very attractive either. The poor girls have no clue what's going on and the managers watch and pretend everything is going well.  Hopefully this place figures things out because if not there will be plenty of place to go across the street in the next year or so with the big development coming in."}
{"text":"I feel like this restaurant has gotten some bad ratings that are questionable. Maybe someone had a bad night, or a bad day, and was not being fair. Granted, most restaurants will have some days that are better than others.  That being said, our experience was nothing short of excellence last night. We had no issues getting a parking space but it was a Thursday evening. We sat at the bar area per our request. The dining room had lots of empty tables but on this particular occasion, we wanted to be near the action. There was a guy playing the guitar and singing some of the older songs that was very good.  But on to the service, beer and food. I will start with the service. Our waitress approached our table as soon as we were seated and was very helpful in our selection from the huge list of draft beers. No wait for a cold draft tonight! She was very observant and acknowledged our request to wait to order our food. When the time came, we placed our order for the Fish Taco's with their signature chips and the Chicken Caesar Wrap with French Fries. The food quickly arrived and was all very fresh. The fries were piping hot. The Fish Taco's were very good as was the Chicken Caesar Wrap. I really do not have anything bad to say about our experience at all. We would definitely visit here again if in the area."}
{"text":"Hello to all that follow me, and the ones that don't I say cheers! since I now currently live in NC from CA, I always say thats where the culinary taste really REALLY evolved..there aren't many places that I have patron that live up to 1 customer service, 2 quality, 3 timing, 4 presentation, 5 taste... so with that said.. I cant out the \"presentation\" part aside as this is comfort food.. but it was presented nicely... BUT the customer service, and the taste of the food really won it for me.. I had a chicken sandwich with fries..doesnt sound too elaborate, but it was awesome!! I ordered.. the meal came like 15 minutes.. and all of the food was hot at the same time! thats a big deal for me.. i cannot tell you how many spots i go to and order, the sandwich comes out hot, but fries/side dish is ...warm..that incredibly saddening.. but NOT HERE..and the drinks were on point!! one of their bartenders..arrggghh!! i cannot remember his his name, but I can say, i believe  he is of Asian decent.. he was super cool, and incredibly professional..overall I give this place 5 stars.. I live in paw creek... so this is not around the corner..but this is one of my new favorite places... if your looking for a very kool, spot for sporting events.. you will NOT regret!"}
{"text":"I hosted a work event in Hickory Tavern's private event room yesterday evening. Maggie, the GM, was amazing to work with leading up to the event. Alexis, Blake & Princess took great care of all of my guests during the event. I felt like the entire Hickory Tavern team went above and beyond. Food was delicious and drinks were on point! Furthermore, the room itself was perfect for an intimate group of 30 or less people. You get a fabulous view of the Charlotte skyline out the windows. I would definitely have an event here again!"}
{"text":"I eat here a lot, however the location at Ballantyne has a really lazy bartender that stands there and gabs all afternoon instead of waiting on the customers. Food is usually good and wait staff is usually good. Providence Road location makes better wings for some reason."}
{"text":"I love their food- burgers, sweet potato fries (with a syrupy drizzle that's amazing), chips and quest, pimiento grilled cheese, shrimp and fish tacos... we have always enjoyed our food. There is a large kids menu as well! Great for a family dinner or appetizers/drinks with friends. However the service at this location is lacking. The last 2 times we have gone, the wait staff is more interested in hanging out by the soda machine/behind hostess stand playing on their phones and hanging out, drinking frappuccinos, and gossiping. If you ask for something it is either a) forgotten, b) going to take forever (example from last visit- 5 minutes for a fork and another 3 for extra napkins) or c.) be given with an attitude. The wait staff would rather socialize with one another than serve and acts like their customers are a bother. We still go occasionally because we love the food but would go much more often if the servers seemed to care about their customers."}
{"text":"We came here often while we were in Huntersville and enjoyed the atmosphere for game day. I especially loved my shrimp and grits one night. good times."}
{"text":"The food was average for a bar-restaurant type of place. Beer selection was ok. Plenty of TVs if you want to watch the game or can be distracting of you're not."}
{"text":"Strike three. Have been here twice before and had to send something back because it was cold or wrong. Same thing happened again. Spoke to the manager and she apologized, but by then it was too late to wait for something else and we had to drive thru fast food on our way. Food is ok when you finally get whatever you want, but just ok.  Nothing special."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite hangouts, but it has gone downhill. The waitresses are great and attentive, but on our last 2 visits, the managers (or whoever those guys are with the earphones in their ears), constantly hover all over the place. It's creepy. Heaven forbid you ask them to change a TV to an ACC team during March Madness. You will get an excuse like \"there's a guy here who wants to watch golf or ESPN commentary,\" which no one can hear.  They changed the menu and eliminated a lot of our favorites.  This used to be a welcoming sports bar; not so much anymore."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Hickory Tavern in the Northlake Mall area of Charlotte. This sports bar chain restaurant offers a wide variety of menu items from chicken wings to crab legs and steak, although they streamlined their menu since our last visit.  Dora here. Hickory Tavern is one of those go-to comfort restaurants for me. You know what I'm talking about, right? When you're tired, don't really know what you want to eat or you just don't want to cook, Hickory Tavern offers an eclectic variety of choices for the whole family. And with all the big screens located on every wall, you can almost kick your shoes off and just relax. Almost. lol.  As you can see, we're early eaters. Anybody else staring at the clock, ready to eat by eleven thirtyish? No? Okay, that's why we beat the rush. :)  The Shrimp Po' Boy features breaded fried shrimp, lettuce, tomato, pickle, cajun remoulade served on a toasted hoagie roll with a side of my favorite tater tots. I don't often order a Po' Boy sandwich but after enjoying this one, it might just be back on my items to order more frequently. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, but the Cajun remoulade is what pulled this entire sandwich together.   Dora here. Not sure why hubby's short on words today. Hmmm. Anyway, the Chicken California Sandwich minus the mushrooms and avocado was moist and juicy and tender, and the bun soft and fresh. Delicious!  Reminded me why I like this place so much, and I admonished hubby that we need to come back more often. It's just a bit of a drive to make it a regular place. The food seemed to take awhile, but so long as the iced tea kept flowing, not a problem. :)  We would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"I made a boo boo and realized I had booked a flight to Charlotte during the time my Atlanta Falcons would be playing in the Super Bowl.  What did I do?  Switched my flight to an earlier one and made it in time to watch the Falcons lose... in historic fashion.  Yes, still salty about it.  However, Hickory Tavern made it easy to be able to watch the game on one of many, many TVs they have in the restaurant.   Hickory Tavern, located in the Metropolitan Complex, is your basic sports bar with basic bar food and lots of big TVs and even a projector.  They have plenty of tables (bar, stool, booth, and table) and also space outside.  It was conveniently located within walking distance to the Sheraton/Le Meridien hotels, which we were staying at.  Making a reservation over the phone was easy peasy and we had our table as soon as we got there.  Service was pretty good, considering it was Super Bowl.  We didn't get a menu for a while, but after ordering, someone was always checking up on us to make sure we had everything we needed.  The food itself was just okay.  We ordered a dozen oysters and these were the biggest oysters I'd ever seen... but they also were some of the worst oysters I've ever had.  Tasted like straight ocean and had a really weird texture.  Meh.  We also ordered hot wings which were pretty much your basic hot wings.  Nothing to call home about.  Now, the sweet potato fries and the tater tots we ordered with it - THAT's where it was at.  Scarfed those things down like nobody's business.  I liked that they were nice and crispy on the outside and hot and soft on the inside.  Yum.  The queso and chips was also very solid.  Needless to say, I left the place pretty bummed due to the outcome of the game, but I'm glad I was able to find somewhere decent to watch the game that wasn't overly crowded or too quiet, and within walking distance from the hotel."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited this Hickory Tavern location for the first time tonight, being only 5 minutes from our new place.  We were looking for good oysters.  We received the exact opposite!  Besides being filled with the common iodine taste I get when served at other Hickory Taverns (or something they obviously use to keep them fresh), I had to put a napkin to my mouth for almost half of 8 I attempted to eat.  They were rotten, as if they had been sitting, opened shell and dead.  Don't go there for oysters at all!  We wish we'd gone to Big Daddy's, Full Moon or Pearlz... these 3 are top and we've never had this type of experience with any of them.  I don't leave comments except in exceptional cases.  I want to make certain you avoid our mistake.  On the positive side, the customer service was great."}
{"text":"I see there are a lot of this in the Charlotte area, and I can't speak for those, but I loved this place.  It was just a little pricey, but I really enjoyed the food, and the beverages.  The service would have received the Gold Star, except the server forgot to bring the tea we ordered.    We went to this place because it was near our hotel, and the hotel actually gave us a coupon for 10% off.  I'm glad we took them up on their offer.  They had a Garden Burger that was as good as the one at Red Robin, and I believe that is the best I've ever eaten.  It did not, however, come with the bottomless fries offered at Red Robin.  The fries on this one looked bad, but actually were pretty good.  They were good enough for us to order more.  The meal was excellent, really hit the spot, and, except for that one noted glitch, the service was great.    I also enjoyed an alcoholic beverage since there were no liquor stores in the area.  I had a \"Tennessee Lemonade,\" or something like that, with whiskey in a lemonade type drink.  I loved it.  I had two, even though they were kind of pricey for my budget.    This place reminded me of the Yardhouse in Lakewood, CO, or any higher level sports bar.  Good food, and good service, but it costs a little bit more.  This place would be fine and perfect for entertaining family on the way through town, or for watching any sport on the big screen TV."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner with kids. Great kids menu with choices other than fries for sides. Staff was very nice and food was very good! T.V.'s everywhere! Nicely priced"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for the Super Bowl last night and although the outcome of the game wasn't quite what we hoped for the service and food was on point. From speaking with several members of the friendly staff including the restaurants GM (sorry I don't recall her name) this was the 1st time they had done a multi stage buffet for the big game/big crowd and it went off well! It included items from oysters on the half shell to crab legs to biscuits and gravy.....they did a fantastic job! I'd like to give props to our server LaTonya who did an outstanding job keeping our \"beverages\" fresh and cold as well as anything else we needed during a really busy/packed restaurant. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So we have  been here a ton of times.  Usually just for drinks but today we decided to change it up a bit. Of course, we started with a couple of draft brews. While sipping our delights, we were approached by the bartender and told every Thursday during the summer is ladies night.  I filled out a form in hopes of winning some swag that was to be given away every 30 minutes. Sweet!  We waited.  6:30 passed, no announcement.  We waited.  7:00 passed, no announcement. I questioned, were they really giving out anything? Who knows! Restaurant and bar were half full at best. If I enter something, at least let me know I lost.  This place, crickets.   Let's move on.  We decided on the food truck menu Steel City Stack. This menu has creations specialized to a specific city, state and have featured the likes of Hawaii too. We decided on the Pennsylvania turkey sandwich with tangy cole slaw, turkey, and French fries served on crispy white bread.  Sounds delicious righttttttt!   We got turkey, white bread (not toasted), dab of coleslaw, fries and two slices of tomato = no taste.  Wow, if you are featuring a city, represent properly.  Disappointed on this creation.  Also waiting 30 minutes with a less than 50% occupied place and five cooks in the kitchen, should not have taken that long.   The final verdict disappointed on multiple ends, however, got something to fill my tummy for dinner.  Will I be back, yeah, I'm walking distance away so they are the most convenient for a brew desperate urge.  Side note: I have noticed service and food are diminishing and it kills me to see the bar tap touch every new brew poured.  A HUGE NO NO!"}
{"text":"This is your average casual food establishment. We were greeted by some nice hostesses and quickly taken to our table. The table was a bit dirty with trash around the floor but we still sat down. We started with the spinach dip, which was pretty good. However, my kids order the chicken tenders and they were greasy and the chicken was tough....ugh! My husband and I ordered the Philly cheesesteak and the smokehouse burger. Those meals were delicious! We will go back on a drunken night but we won't be regulars!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the location. Only sit down restaurant in the area other than an Asian place. Thus, it's a \"neighborhood\" place and the wait staff remembers their customers. 4 stars because Hickory Tavern's prices have steadily increased over the past few years to a point where I no longer go there just to stop in for a bite...or drink."}
{"text":"Been here at least 20 times, since they've been open. Typically they're lunch service is a little slow, which we've gotten used to. Took the wife out for dinner around 5:50 after a movie on a Saturday evening. Got to say, the worst service I've \"ever\" had in my entire life. Our meal took over an hour to come out, other tables that arrived after we did were served at least 15 minutes earlier. After an hour, my buffalo tacos came out as a buffalo sandwich. Wouldn't be writing this review if our server (Steven by the way) would have come by and acknowledged the order & let us know the status. We were totally ignored, as a matter of fact, I got my initial drink order & \"never\" got a refill in almost an hour & a half! When my remade meal did come out, I had the manager box it up to go. The manager was apologetic & comped our meal. Honestly, he had no choice. Our server never came back by, we bounced. By his demeanor, looked like he had a bad attitude? I'm done with Hickory Tavern Sun Valley."}
{"text":"Been waiting an hour for buffalo & fish tacos. Mine came out as a sandwich. Waiter didn't acknowledge my order being wrong. He's been scarce AF too. Not feeling like a generous tipper...."}
{"text":"I have gone to two different Hickory Taverns within the last 3 weeks.  Not much different.  Big screens, TVs...a bar, and a decent menu.  The atmosphere was quiet during the day visit for lunch.  The night trip was also quiet...not too busy.  Service was typical for a bar restaurant.  The servers have to wait multiple tables....so not much interaction.   The food, especially the sweet potato fries, that were drizzled with honey and butter was good.  I ordered a salad with chicken.  I was surprised that the grilled chicken came out on the salad very cold....as if it was removed from freezer.  However the server was very quick to get a fresh salad topped with a very nicely grilled, chicken breast.  very good.  The other thing that provided the \"bar\" feel at one of the restaurants....was ordering bottled drinks (beers and coolers) and not being offerred a frosted mug or glass.  I thought that was fairly standard.  Should not have to ask...should have been offered.  I will return....with family and friends to see how larger crowds are handled.  good locations and good parking."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I have no clue why I keep going because service is absolutely horrible everytime i go. When I ate there the first time it seems like the waitresses always disappear and never come back. My husband ordered a beer and he never got it. I ordered cheese on fries once they forgot the cheese and when I told them they gave me cold shredded cheese.   Tonight my husband and I ordered takeout 30 minutes before getting there I called in the order when my husband got there it wasn't ready and he had to wait an additional 30 minutes....then they made the order for dine in instead of take out. The waitresses disappeared on him a few times. Then the food...gross...nothing had flavor not even my poor piece of salmon...it was juicy but no flavor. My husband ordered wings and he said it just tasted like chicken.   In all seriousness management needs to evaluate their company cause it's not just this location and whoever this lady is who comments \"sorry this happened\" on the other reviews needs to stop and reevaluate her life too."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Hickory Tavern? Just don't get the Tennessee Lemondae, unless you like weak drinks."}
{"text":"We went there in a game night, so there was some brutal noise, but we didn't mind =)   \"An Asian girl\" was our waitress. She was very helpful, very kind and when she noticed we were out of States, she begun to articulate more, thanks for that! Well, food was very good, service was excellent, wine was cheap, game night was actually also kind of fun.  Next night we went back and I asked our new waitress what is \"grits\". She didn't know how to explain so she got me sample from kitchen!  If you go there, ask what is days vegetable :)"}
{"text":"To begin, the service was slow for a half empty restaurant. The waitress got the orders mixed up on the check and took 20 additional minutes to fix the mistake. All together we were there for 2 hours with only 4 people.  The food, which took more than 30 minutes to arrive at the table after ordering was anything but special. The burger I ordered wasn't seasoned and was dry. The chili was minimal and the slaw had a store bought taste. The price of the burger was too much for the poor quality. If you want good food and great service, I suggest finding another restaurant. I will not be returning to Hickory Tavern."}
{"text":"Ordered food from here the first time through Postmates and the artichoke dip was amazinggggg and so was the other food i ended up going again the other day with a coworker and dined in and had the fried Calamari it was to die for first time trying it and loved it the blackened fish sandwich on the other hand was mediocre but overall good experience"}
{"text":"Well for a place that has pictures of musician and quotes from musician on the wall. Should make it inconvenient from there guest and the bands that play there.. they have no stage or lighting for bands. If you happen to sit where the band going to be set up you are asked to move to make room for band. The wait staff not very friendly... y'all need to go to a wild wing cafe and take notes there entertainment is not an after thought and nor does it interfere with the guest..."}
{"text":"We went last year to this tavern, and I didn't know whether I should do a review, but i can't hold it back. We got sick before we even left the parking lot. We went back and told the manager and she didn't even seem to care. Do not go there, you will get sick too."}
{"text":"I am by far the biggest fan of Hickory Tavern's build your own salad. I literally could eat it every day. At this location,  however, simple instruction and ability to listen seem to be their biggest hurdle.  I've called in to go orders, on multiple occasions, and they just can't seem to ever get it right. I don't know if it's the \"builder\" or the person taking the order.   The continued mistake has prevented me from calling these guys for the past couple of weeks but tonight I really wanted one of those salads and decided to give it a shot.  Friday night, super busy inside, go in, food is ready, get home, and BAM... It's wrong again. The roller coaster of emotion from excitement to disappointment to anger is the reason I'm writing today. $12.95 for a salad (with protein), when built by the customer, should be done correctly 100% of the time!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Hickory Tavern BYO salad.. Nothing else really stands out at this particular location."}
{"text":"5 thumbs down for this Hictory Tavern location!!!! First of all the waitress was rude to  the customers. She was loud and argumentative with some guys standing next to me. Secondly, my food was not cooked properly and I \"thought\" the waitress was bringing  back a whole new entree.  Nope..she returned my same \"picked over\" burger back to me fully cooked. ( Major food violation) Finally you would think the store manager  ( Tom Blake)  would be trained to handle any/all store issues right? Sad to say.. Tom's way of dealing with a overcrowded restaurant is to call the police and LIE by saying... folks are  causing trouble  and refusing to leave the restaurant. ( Not true!) I sat at my table and watched the whole incident. Those guys was not causing trouble nor refusing to leave! Anyways, I can go on and on about how awful this location treats customers! Honestly, I almost thought the staff was drunk that night! Because I have NEVER seen this type of behavior/crazyness from a restaurant."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a very long time, mostly due to bad food options and other service-related issues. We decided to give it another try: my daughter ordered a Tavern Burger while I ordered 5 (five? why not 6?) \"charred\" hot wings. After the food FINALLY came out (charred wings apparently take 10 mins longer than regular wings) all of it was very good.  My daughter's burger looked great, however, for the life of me, I don't understand why they sell 5 and 10 count wings as opposed to 6, 12, or 18 count like other restaurants do. I feel that Hickory Tavern's idea is to skimp on 1 wing here and there - it all adds up to savings.  Therefore, 0 stars for Hickory Tavern corporation as a whole for not putting the full wing (flat & drum) in the order count, therefore ripping customers off (ya cheap azzes.)  3 stars for the food and our server, Luke, who was very good."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern trades out on what the Carolinas use to be and misses the mark on what Charlotte is.  Charlotte is a major city now.  It is still growing.  This new style (this location) is a move in the right direction.  Decor and layout are pluses, but menu selection and service leave a lot to be desired.  Let me re-emphasize the service.  It is not even close to being good.  I have been in this location three times now.  Only once did we have a server with a personality.  None of the times did the food come out in a realistic time frame. Why oh why do I see cooks in the dining room?  Why did it take 25 minutes to get food on a day when they simply were not busy?  Oh, thats right... the cooks are watching TV in the dining room.  I guess the servers are in the back doing their nails."}
{"text":"Oh Hickory Tavern how you were a big disappointment!  We went here last night as our power went out once we got home from work and needed something for dinner, as well as a place to hang out since the power was estimated to come back on around 9 p.m.  The inside of Hickory Tavern is nice, but I feel like there are better setups with tables and tvs at other sports bars.  I think it could be a good go to option for watching a sporting event in the bar area, not the dining area.  The food, this is why you get a star Hickory Tavern.  Plenty of food options, but why bother if it is crap?  I can't speak for it all, but I have no desire to go back because of what I had.  I tried the philly steak sandwich with peppers, onions, and cheese.  The steak was so incredibly bad.  I had a bite or two and was done.  It reminded me of the frozen shaved beef you can find at the grocery store, but with an outdated and old flavor.  It was so bad, I do not think I have had anything as bad as that sandwich.  I would rather force myself to eat brussel sprouts.  Kevin had the fish taco and buffalo chicken taco, just okay.  Would rather drive to another area of Charlotte to go to another sports bar than go back to HT."}
{"text":"This newly-opened Hickory Tavern at the Met is filled with TVs! The TVs are laid out really well for watching a bunch of games or just the one you want. It should be easy to get the game on that you want.   The beer list is expansive and full of new arrivals. I love that. The staff may necessarily not be beer lovers but they can help a little. Always plenty of drink specials during the week worth checking out. Pretty nice prices on drinks too.  I'd definitely recommend this location for a Saturday full of hoops or March Madness when it comes.  - valet available"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service at all! In fact I would say my first and LAST visit was atrocious!! The \"waitress\" if I could call her that was horrible...uncaring about her job and clearly unhappy with waiting on customers... Not judging just reporting facts. When the waitress rolls her eyes at you when you say you need a few more minutes!! When you ask the waitress what dressings there are for salads and the waitress points at the menu makes you well aware you have chosen the WRONG LOCAL ESTABLISHMENT to support! Piss poor service. Piss poor food as well! Such a shame though.....I would strongly suggest driving a bit further to Blakeney or Stonecrest!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I've read negative reviews about Hickory Tavern Mallard Creek. Managers and servers are always pleasant and helpful. Frequently sit in the outdoor patio. Whatever manager is on duty always, without fail, comes outside, multiple times, to check on our party. Servers are good with recommendations. We like to linger, take our time, start with a round of drinks. Never made to feel rushed. Food has always been great-fresh, tasty, prepared to order. Fresh tuna is outstanding. Salads are fresh-no old ingredients. The staff, servers, and manager on duty on Saturday night 7/1/17,from 8 pm until midnight were great. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great layout and location. Great bar setup and amount of tv's for watching football. It is the place to be down in SW Charlotte for Sunday football.   Con's: You will not get out of this place for less than $70 a couple if you plan to watch some games, eat and drink. $70 is probably low balling it too. I just wish they had better beer prices, something like a domestic beer for $2 during games would be great. Also the menu prices are steap $12 for a burger is a bit over the top. The only reason my friends and I opt to go to another place instead is strictly due to price. Have a special Sunday football menu or something that would go along ways I think."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful, service is good, but took way you long to get a Salad and a Chicken salad sandwich to come to the table. 5 stars would have been if the food came out faster"}
{"text":"Met friends and family for late night drinks. Excellent service and great beer selection, but the lone guitarist was too damn loud. You think he was playing for a crowd of hundreds, and there weren't more than 50 people. My ears hurt after hours of it. Even the wait staff agreed."}
{"text":"So, so... Just got water. I enjoyed the view. It was the best part about this restaurant!!   I didn't exactly like the selection of cuisine."}
{"text":"Went in a Saturday night my friend said the food was good and cheap. We were seated quickly outside. The floor was super dirty but it was cinco de Mayo and they had happy hour so I understood. I had the veggie burger and onion rings. None of it had any taste. My server was really sweet and nice but when I ordered I asked for ranch and then when she dropped the food we asked again and she never brought it. I was disappointed because she was so sweet. I'll never be back. I feel sick for eating that tasteless probably microwaved food. I dislike franchises but I decided to give it a try given that I just moved to NC BUT NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Had appetizers and drinks at the bar with great service! Our bartender was very nice and gave great suggestions on local brews and best sauces for wings! Overall great experience. I would recommend the wings and they have a wing night special on Wednesday's with bingo to win prizes!"}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count and don't know why I haven't written a review. So, here goes: I like this place a lot. It is the perfect place to grab good food and a brew. It is the perfect place to go alone or with a group of friends. I have been here every day of the week and have never been disappointed with the food or the service.  My favorites: The BBQ Chicken Nachos and the Honey Bee Sting Wings. Make certain to get the wings charred. Trust me, it is worth the extra charge. The B.Y.O. Salad is also a good option. They do not skimp on the ingredients and it comes served in a large bowl that allows for proper mixing of the salad with the dressing.  Pro Tip: Bloody Mary's are on special Sundays. Great for watching the Panthers! Or whichever team you prefer..."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3 times and have only gotten the wings or shrimp. We go on nights those are on special. Both are very good. We live closer to the Wesley Chapel location but our last 2 times there we ended up walking out when no one waited on us and drove to the Sun Valley location and got immediate and great service. As a whole though Hickory Taverns beer prices are too high. $2.95 is the special beer of the month price for a bottle of Bud Light. Nothing special about that. Hefs on Sardis Rd is half that."}
{"text":"I think I've finally eaten at all the Hickory Tavern's around town now, and I can say that they're all well run and they all knock out pretty standard items well.  This one is one of the best, friendly service, crispy chips, and clean bathrooms, all the hallmarks of a well run joint.  As I've said in other reviews, the best items on the menu here are the build your own salads.  You can build it any way you want, and they keep it pretty cheap when you add on a bunch of additional items.  The wings are good here too, so if you're watching a game here, which I recommend since they have a million TVs and a great beer selection, try those too and you'll be fat and happy in no time."}
{"text":"It's bar food, but higher quality bar food. Still, $.75 oysters are a hard deal to pass up. Even if I get a piece of a shell every so often. Friendly service. Never had anything less than enthusiastic service."}
{"text":"This place sucks! The waitress are the main problem. I just sat at a table for 15 minutes staring at a group of waitresses talk, ALL FACING ME! The guy beside me looked around helplessly until he eventually decided to just leave. I had to get up go out of my seat and ask for a menu. When I did that, the waitress ignored my complaint of sitting for so long. She handed me a menu and disappeared so I just left.   The fact that this is one of the only restaurants that stay open late in rivergate with decent food SUCKS when you're starving."}
{"text":"We say for 10 mins while our server was flirting with other servers. Never got to order food. They even just watched us walk out. No one even tried to stop us. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Don't ever go to this place and hope to see the hometown team play. The staff was completely unaccommodating to switch any TV...even if absolutely no one was watching the game. Only 4 TV's out of 100 are on the hometown team. Way to support the home team Hickory Tavern!"}
{"text":"Very impressed.  I have been in this shopping center dozens of times yet this was my first visit to the Hickory Tavern.  I had no expectations yet I was very pleasantly surprised.  We were greater and seated promptly.  There were more than enough TV's with several sporting events.  The food was great.  My kids loved their naked wings.  My wife's blackened shrimp tacos were excellent.  My Korean BBQ tenders were amazing.  I liked the sauce which had just the right amount of spice.  Next time I will get the sauce on the side to avoid the breading getting soggy at the end, though it was still really good.  The highlights for me were the food truck tater tots and the service.  Our server was friendly, prompt, and responsive.  It made for a great family dinner at the Hickory Tavern."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, plenty of TV's. Priced affordably. They do serve food, but stop the dinner dinner menu at 10:30. We ordered the BBQ chicken nachos and they were so good!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorite spots with great food, great service, and great drinks. But now, and for the last year at least, it's been awful. The service is beyond awful and the food is hardly ever edible. The last salad I had was wilted and slimy and this time I got the dish tacos. I couldn't finish them because I thought I was going to throw up. The fish tasted horrible and when I told the waitress (after she came back to the table after 20+ minutes) she seemed completely annoyed that I said anything about it. We sat at the table with empty glasses for the entire meal and asked for refills that we never got. I won't be back, this place has had its chances!"}
{"text":"Went to Hickory Tavern last night for the first time last night.  It was in Providence, NC right near Charlotte, NC.  I was here due to the hurricane in Florida.  The atmosphere was very cool and a  extremely busy tavern.  The menu was full of great meals and appetizers.  There was a variety of \"hogies\" and I ordered the French Dip and Queso Dip as an appetizer.   Our waitress was Jennifer and she was extremely precise in her serving us.  We had a party of ten and the drinks were brought out first thing.  She took our order at the same time and the appetizer was brought next and very good.  After the appetizer our food was brought our within 5 minutes and it looked excellent.   The presentation of everyone's food was perfect.    The only thing I didn't care for was the lack of shaved prime rib in my sandwich.  The beef broth was robust and tasty and everyone was content with each of their meals, Jennifer refilled our drinks on time and she helped make a great time."}
{"text":"This is actually kind of classy for a sports bar.  They have a really nice interior with lots of TVs all around so sports fans can be sure to catch the game.  The service was really good, the waitress was really friendly and gave some really good suggestions.  The grilled chicken sandwich was excellent.  It tasted really fresh and wasn't overcooked like some chicken can be."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting this place. This is the second sports bar that I had visited over the years after visiting one in Ohio. We went as a group from the company, our group count goes to 10 people. They had long surf board table that can fit more than 10+ people and u have got screens all around running games, news and some funny videos channel. They have also got a big projector to be used during the game season  With regards to the service our waiters were helpful and prompt. But with regards to the service time of getting the food order from u and actually delivering the food, I can say their time is close to 6 on the scale of 10. I guess it depends on the people in the group and their order. But overall the bar was not much crowded, I can say it was an average crowding. I guess if u go as a small group their service would be faster i guess.  Now the food. I ordered the Oregon cedar salmon. I have never tasted it anywhere so I wasn't in any expectation. The presentation was top notch and the taste of the salmon was really good. Overall the whole plate was really fulfilling. The sweet potato fries is another thing it was quite different and I liked it. Awesome job guys  One recommendation is that the service times can be improved."}
{"text":"This Hickory Tavern, located on 521 just north of 485 is a great location for lunch meetings in the area. Quick & friendly servce, and the food is always great. Fiesta Salad, Chicken Tacos, Fish Sandwich or Tavern Burger are the way to go. For those of you on a diet, I can attest to the lunch meal of veggie burger, no-bun and a double side of steamed broccoli."}
{"text":"Very slow Saturday night. It took over 45 minutes for burgers and sandwiches to come out. About 15 minutes for drink/beer refills.  $11 for a buffalo chicken sandwich with barely any fries, and half a cup of ketchup. Waitress never asked how food was, we never saw her until we were all done.the Wesley chapel location is a step above, but would rather go to Moes or BT Burgers ."}
{"text":"I hate to bad mouth our server because he was so nice but he was very slow, inattentive and somewhat unprofessional. He informed us the kitchen was slow tonight as soon as we sat down. Our appetizer came out before our food and was served to us by someone else who then had to grab our drinks for us. We watched our server look at the tips his other table had left him and laugh at one of the tips. My drink was super tiny and overpriced, our appetizer (spinach artichoke dip) was cold, my entree (Buffalo chicken tacos) was mainly fried breading, cole slaw & pico de gallo. We asked them if they could change the tv to the football game 3 times but it never happened. The server was super nice but I don't think we'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Great staff. Calm atmosphere. Love to go there with my three little boys on days that I am too lazy to cook dinner or before a movie.  The food is usually as delicious as can be expected from American Traditional pub food. There have been times when the food takes an inordinate amount of time to be done. Otherwise it would be 5 stars for what it is."}
{"text":"Very very very nice staff. Yes it's a bar but don't make that not male you try the food.its actually pretty good and decently priced. The chicken tacos are to die for.  I will say one thing. This is a bar so stick with bar foods!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner at Hickory Tavern.  I ordered a Caeser salad to start which was cold and crisp with right amount of dressing and then the wing entree with teriyaki sauce and a fluffy baked potato with scallions and sour cream.  My husband ate all of his cedar plank salmon and asparagus.  Our server, Brittany was great!  She was attentive and prompt with our order.  It was a relaxing Saturday night out."}
{"text":"Great food! Got the turkey club and the brown sugar mustard is worth the stop alone. The sandwich has thick cut turkey wit melted cheese- delicious.   There are tons of televisions showing all the different NFL games. Great game day spot."}
{"text":"Stopped for a late lunch here. It wasn't very busy yet we still waited quite some time for anyone to get to us. We ordered a burger & a chicken sandwich. Both were okay but nothing special.  The service was incredibly slow & our drinks went unfilled until someone other than our waiter refilled them. Asked for ranch & honey mustard & didn't get that until we were both about done with our meals. Pretty pricey for what you get. Doubt we'll be back"}
{"text":"The service at this location is horrible. The waitress would walk by our table 2 or 3 times before actually stopping to see what we needed. After we ordered the food took forever to come out and it was not busy. When they did bring the food mine was missing and came out several minutes later. The decor definitely needs a little update and the building was freezing. I had to get a blanket out of my car to bring in to warm up. Very disappointing visit for my family lunch."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL NIGHT. Went out with some friends for drinks and food to catch up on old times. The beer selection was great offering a lot of local beers and craft. The burger was good and they cooked it medium rare like I like. Service was good and just enough if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Food was good, almost always is. Can be pricey,  watch for all the costly upgrades. Lots of TV's which is great!   Felicia was an awesome waitress.  Vodka & red bull $10 tall glass ouch"}
{"text":"The food is good. Nothing too impressive. I would not go out of my way to recommend this restaurant to others, but it is a good place to take friends to watch football on Sundays.  Our server was absolutely horrifically slow. He took at least 5-10 minutes to get each and every refill. He would randomly disappear for long periods of time, making it difficult to order dessert or get the check. It took him 15 minutes just to bring out the dessert, which normally doesn't make me upset except for the fact that I was staring at him standing in the kitchen talking to another server the entire time."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience. Went in with some old friends and we had a great ole time. Our server Abby I believe was just amazing. Stayed on top of refills and treated us real kind. A must attend when I re visit"}
{"text":"Done with hickory tavern, had a long week at work so wanted a good supper. I used their online service ordering a po boy plain, wife runs in to get it and receipt says nothing on po boy but when she gets to the car there's everything on it. The manager krista was very rude and I get to go without supper. I have always had good service at all the hickory taverns but service here sucks"}
{"text":"NO..NO..NO...My friend and I ordered takeout from here about two hours before closing time on a Sunday night, it wasn't busy at all so we assumed the food would be edible at least! BOY..was I wrong. I ordered a basic tavern burger and my friend had twelve wings. My first issue was the line cook was leaning across the bar when we walked in and this was no more than fifteen minutes after placing our to go order. Our food was already bagged up and ready which was my second issue. I'm in the food and beverage industry so I was skeptical once we received the food but the bartender provided great customer service and I was engaged in conversation so I made the mistake of not checking my food (my mistake). As I left,the same cook who  made my food was outside smoking a cigarette as if he had been working hard on preparing QUALITY FOOD. I got home and opened up the bag and realized I received seven of the twelve wings and a luke-warm burger. The worst part was the wings had been pre-dropped obviously because they were dry and flavorless.  I'm in the food and beverage industry so I would understand if it took me a long time to get the food or if I stayed far away. I live not even three minutes driving radius from this establishment.  To say the least this was the second bad experience I had here and I will not be back to spend thirty bucks on poor quality food.. I advise anybody to pick another place to eat."}
{"text":"This location of the Hickory Tavern chain is very comfortable compared to other sports bars I've been to, and every time I have come there was a good crowd (which I do want if I watch sports).   The big downside is the food: It is on the high end of what this type of place usually charges, but at the low end quality-wise. The wings tasted of old grease (5.80 for six wings), and someone else in my party said the fish in his tacos tasted very salty (9 dollar range I think). The nachos were soggy and definitely did not taste very fresh (also around 9 dollars). Sandwiches and burgers start at 9 dollars (seems to be the magic number here).   On the upside, this place always has a craft brew special, which cannot be taken for granted at sports bars.   Disclosure: I am not a fan of sports bars in general. I have come here twice specifically for trivia. The trivia is fun, the prizes for the three best teams are 10, 15 and 25 dollars - not generous, but decent enough."}
{"text":"The reviews are pretty accurate.  Decent food with service that is okay. It is something that the management and workers should take seriously.  More and more people are reading yelp and Google reviews.  The educated consumer is going to support a business that is attentive to their needs. I had the shrimp and grits.  They were good. Service was slow. Walked by a few times with not even a glance though I was waving and calling them. Hopefully they will improve"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere!! Waiters and waitress were very nice.  Even though it was busy for the basketball game,  the bartender need to at least slow down to make sure the drinks are correct.  One drink was missing a main ingredient  The charred wings are FRIED  first then placed on a grill.  That defeats the purpose of trying to eat better.  Customer should be informed about that. Tater tots tasted old... definitely not hot. Maybe better next time!!"}
{"text":"I rate this place a solid four. It's a good sports bar. Lots of TVs, good beer selection,  full menu and good staff.  Oddly the build your own salads are pretty good as well. Random."}
{"text":"I recently stopped by to celebrate a birthday with a group of 7 and our waitress was great.  We had several orders with various changes and all of our orders were correct.  When we arrived for our 6pm dinner and the dining room had a lot of availability; however, within the hour, the tables filled up due to the games that were on that evening.  Great location with meeting people, with easy find.  -Wally"}
{"text":"Amazing wings! There sauces are not just your average Franks Red Hot mixed with butter. They could expand their local beer draft selection though. Not alot of good IPA's"}
{"text":"Wow what a terrible experience this time around the worst customer service ever, the food was cold and the waitress was out there like came to the table 4 times in 2 hrs. Food took 50 minutes to get to the table.    Not happy hopefully the next visit will be better."}
{"text":"I stopped in Hickory Tavern on Friday night with my boyfriend and some of his coworkers and was pleasantly surprised with our visit!   It was a pretty large party but they pulled one tables together and we had two waitresses ready to take our drink orders! We ordered a little bit of everything beer, wine, margaritas and of course shots! And everyone's drinks came out quickly...which surprised me because this placed was super packed!!! I guess it's too be expected since this place seemed like the perfect go to spot for game day tons of TVs everywhere with different games on each one!   We ordered some appetizers wings, chips and salsa and cheese sticks all pretty standard but very good.   For our meals we had a little bit of everything...just a few things I remember from our table were the chicken tenders, burgers, sandwiches and crab cakes...and they all looked super delicious! I went with the Smothered Chicken which was a chicken breast, Mushrooms & Onions Sautéed with white Wine Garlic Butter, Jack Cheese and for the sides I chose a loaded baked potato and side salad. It came out HOT!! I really enjoyed the chicken, it was very tender and moist! I would recommend it!   We all left stuffed and happy....it was a good visit... Totally recommend this place and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Service is always fast and friendly. The cheese dip with chips is a must get. They have a great beer selection and one of my favorites white zombie white ale. Only down side tonight is they had a random lady with an iPad in the corner changing the music every 30  seconds which left me confused because I thought she was jst drunk since she wouldn't let a song play for me to even figure out what song it was and she was dancing around the whole bar mostly entertaining the men.Apparently she is hired to be here every Tuesday 7:30p.m-9:30p.m and she announced it so I'll know not to come those days the music was jst annoying and her taking into the microphone jst randomly. WHO WOULD PAY FOR SOMEONE TO PLAY MUSIC OFF SPOTIFY. It's now 10 and she left and the music is back to normal"}
{"text":"Service was horrible, waiting time for a couple of drinks too long, it wasn't no host to take you to a table ... Great food, I give them that, just that."}
{"text":"Great stand-by when you want something close. The bar staff is great - Jacob, Nichole and Emily rock! As far as the place in general goes, nothing stands out. Hickory Tavern floats in the murky land between mediocrity and goodness. The food is consistently decent but they took the best burger off the menu; they'll still make it if you ask, I think it was called black and bleu. I find myself here a couple times a month whether for work or for a dinner when I don't feel like cooking. I certainly wouldn't call it a date spot or a cultural hub but it's good for a business lunch or to watch a game if you're into that - in fact I think the Panthers just made a basket, everyone started yelling!"}
{"text":"Haters gonna hate, but it was it is.  I called a little after lunch and talked to the manager.  I asked if they would have sound for the game 7 of the NHL.  He said, yes, no problem, as long as someone else hasn't asked for sound of another game first.  So, I tell my buddies to come along.  With that in mind, we get there early.  I ask about sound and the server said, sure, we've just got music playing, shouldn't be a problem.  She takes our first beer order and goes back to talk to the manager.  She comes back with our beers and being a polite person, and the game hadn't started yet, I didn't ask about the sound.  We wait and wait, still no sound in the game.  Our server comes by one more time and we order another round, she said she'd check on the sound.  We get our beers, and never see the server again.  Nor the manager.  I eventually just left cash on the table, no check ever came, no sound, absolutely ridiculous and just plain out rude.  The manager could have at least come by with a BS excuse and pretended we existed.  I could have just as easily watched the game at my house, but friends wanted to go out.  We won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Super slow service and disturbing programming on TVs make this location anything but family friendly. After dealing with 2 confused hostesses, my husband, almost 3 year old, and I were seated at 5:45. It took at least 10 minutes before our server approached us. He sat down and told us how busy he was and suggested we do shots. Um, no thanks, seeing as we have our kid with us. We asked if we could please put in our order because we're hungry and ready to eat. He took our order and it took at least 30 minutes for our food to come in which he did stop back once to apologize for the delay.   During that time, ChiveTV was on 6 of the TVs in view of our table. ChiveTV played disturbing \"crash\" videos for 15 minutes straight (cars, motorcycles, bicycles, etc). Our kiddo LOVES things with wheels, so he was entranced despite our best efforts to distract him from the disturbing videos. I walked him up to the hostess stand to ask that they change ChiveTV to literally anything else as what has been playing due to the content being displayed. She said she would talk to the manager. A new segment came on that with a \"head shots\" theme that showed videos of people experiencing things hitting their heads in mostly violent, graphic ways. I flagged down our waiter and asked if he could please have them turn off ChiveTV. He asked the manager to change the channel and he changed it one one of the 6 TVs in view of our table, so basically he did nothing. Once we were seated for 45 minutes without food and a kid on the verge of a meltdown, I flagged down the manager and asked if he could please check on our food. Coincidentally that is when it hit the table and he just walked away without apologies or conversation. After we finished eating, I took my son to the car so we could avoid further viewing of traumatizing videos while my husband waited a while for the check.  The food was pretty good although perhaps that was because we were starving by the time we received it. This place markets themselves as family friendly and has an extensive children's menu. They should save the ChiveTV for after 8pm as to not expose children to graphic, disturbing videos. The manager had many opportunities to stop by and try to make things right, but he chose not to. He looked busy as he was running food to tables, so perhaps it was a tough night for him, but that's no excuse for such poor customer service. We love the Ballantyne location of Hickory Tavern and will choose to dine there instead despite it being a further drive."}
{"text":"Just randomly stopped in while riding on the Greenway. Food was great and the waiter was good too. Will return for sure in the future."}
{"text":"Ate here about four times now, the food is mostly good and the place is big with outside covered seating.  The only bad thing is the service, really slow!  I have been in there when empty and rarely see our server.  The hostess and a server greeted us when we walked in with their conversation which they finished in front of us before acknowledging us!  This place could be good if they could get a better handle on customer service.  The burgers are good, the queso and chips are great, pizza is even good.  Hope they get a better management style at this location!"}
{"text":"This is my very first time at Hickory Tavern...I'm loving it!  The food is awesome, especially the Brussels sprouts.  I didn't think I liked them until I tried them here.    The atmosphere is fun and lively, the staff is great and attended to my every need.  This has been a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game as there are plenty of tv's to choose from. The food is tasty for a chain. I didn't give it a 5 due to our waitress. God love her as she was sweet, but needs some training. It was shift change just as our food came out. She bugged us what felt like every minute for 10-15mins which ruined the enjoyment of our meal."}
{"text":"It was very good. Service could've been better. The price was great. I was truly impressed with their bucket of boat trash. Super cool.  We ate wings and that. Had a pleasant time."}
{"text":"Went there on a busy weeknight, and they actually refused to serve a cocktail to my 49 year old wife, who had not brought her purse with her.  While she does look pretty good for her age, the episode was utterly ridiculous.  A nervous manager came over with free chips and salsa, but we will never go there again.  I mean, if she was 90 years old, would they still refuse to serve w/o ID?  Are they really afraid of being busted for serving a 49 year old?!?"}
{"text":"This place has really good Bloody Mary's and I really enjoyed the steamed oysters. I've had the hot wings here in the past and they are also very good. The place can get a bit crowded and noisy when the big screen TV's are showing favorite sporting events, but that is not a problem in my book."}
{"text":"wow, horrible, went there last night with my son, i ordered the tavern burger with french fries, the burger was luke warm and tasted really bad, the french fries were sooogy and oily. my son had the chicken tenders with ent potato chips, the chicken tasted like rubber and his chips were soaked in oil and raw. i dont give reviews but i had to for this one."}
{"text":"I came here after learning the four star pizza restaurant I wanted to go to was closed. I checked out Hickory on Yelp to see what others thought. I figured I could grab a bite to eat and stay for the game. The service wasn't bad. The hostess was pleasant and the bartender was very nice. I totally forgot her name. Anyway. I played it safe with wings and fries. I have to say the wings actually sucked. Some places just don't get wings right. There was absolutely no flavor with them. The wing sauce nor the blue cheese saved them. To save face and make myself feel better, I ate all the wings but left a portion of the fries. To their credit, the sweet potato fries had a honey butter sauce that was rather tasty and intriguing. Unfortunately, they could not save the wings. I had a local beer which wasn't bad by far. Needless to say, I wouldn't return here unless I only intended to drink or it was a late night and I was starving. And I didn't stay for the game."}
{"text":"Don't you do it.  You're probably visiting Charlotte/new to charlotte if you're reading this review.    You've either had Hickory Tavern in other towns, and you're going for 'quality control' or you think this sounds unique (it's like an NC TGI Friday's).  It's not.  There are better options....  (Like a frozen dinner at Trader Joe's right across the street)"}
{"text":"Good place to catch a game - very loud, lots of TVs blaring over the conversation. Pretty good lunch. Parking stinks unless you valet."}
{"text":"We ate at this location after church today and arrived after the lunch rush thankfully.  We had a party of four and were seated and welcomed right away.  I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich which is grilled chicken breast, lettuce, pepper jack cheese, sautéed mushrooms and guacamole, and it comes with tomato, but I opted not.  It was quite good, though messy to eat.  The steak fries could've used some seasoning, but were cooked nicely.    My husband got wings in Jamaican Jerk seasoning and a bowl of chili.  He said after we left that he could taste the freezer burn on his wings, he had asked for no chives and it came with them and had to ask (after waiting for our waitress to resurface) for a spoon for his chili.  Bummer.  Our two friends that joined us had salmon, one with broccoli and one with tater tots and both added house salads which were huge!  Both said it's a go to favorite at Hickory Tavern and were very pleased.  Our waitress was Kendall and she did a good job, probably not great, but good.  She was on top of things until the glasses got empty and she took a break apparently while we were waiting on our check.  We ended up flagging down another waitress because our friends had afternoon plans and needed to get on down the road.  Other than that she was friendly, got our orders complete and was helpful without being overly so.  We would go again if asked, and might plan to go back on our own soon as well to try some of the other dishes. I would technically go 3.5 stars to give a little room for more improvement, but I'll round up to 4 because my meal was quite yummy."}
{"text":"I have never left a negative rating about a place but Hickory Tavern has gone downhill.  It used to be a favorite of our family's for years as the buffalo chicken meals were the best.  The food used to be consistently great but after the last 3 visits, we are not going back.  Talked to a manager and they have changed the buffalo sauces but they are terrible in our opinion.  The chicken used to be tender and delicious but is now hardened as we went to different Hickory Taverns over the last 1-2 months.  We used to be regulars but now we will not go back."}
{"text":"Isn't the best food I've ever had and the prices are high for the quality. It's hit or miss and I've missed more than I've hit. The service is OK"}
{"text":"It was my first time there and the atmosphere was really nice. The food was good and I was surprised at the selection because all I had heard about was their wings."}
{"text":"A decent place to have a meal so long as your family is small. Staff tried seating a 4 year old at a high top and then reset our wait time to additional 20 minutes in their ridiculously small waiting area. There is plenty of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Very average. Been here a few times, not bad. Beer was best part of meal. Dirty tables and servers standing around talking. Manager doing more work than servers. Nothing to write home about. Will probably return, but just for a beer."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern is a great place to relax and unwind. TVs everywhere. Food is great and service is very good. Great convenient location on Harris Blvd and Statesville Ave."}
{"text":"Awesome service. I dined by myself and my server took GREAT care of me. I highly recommend Hickory Tavern."}
{"text":"I ended up at Hickory Tavern for my cousin's birthday dinner. I expected bar food and big TVs, and that's essentially what we got. I was a little thrown off when my GPS led me past Northlake Mall to Harris Corner, because I initially thought the restaurant was in the shopping center adjacent to the mall, but that's Fox and Hound. Not Hickory Tavern. Anyway, my experience at HT was super underwhelming. Our waitress really tried her best, but it wasn't enough to overcome the rest of the experience. First, the drinks from the bar seemed watered down. I'm not one to expect a double pour when ordering a single, but I also don't expect to order a gin and tonic with hardly any gin. Nobody at the table was pleased with their drink, except for folks who ordered beer and wine. Next, the food. I ordered the wing entree, with tater tots. The tots were room temperature and bland. The wings were ok, but by this point I was a little over the whole thing. There are too many good restaurants in Charlotte to eat mediocre food. I wouldn't go back, but if you decide to go, stick to beer/wine and don't settle for cold tater tots lol."}
{"text":"I've been to Hickory several times now, and have had all positive experiences.  The food is always good, I especially like the burgers.  The nachos are also great as well.  I usually sit at the bar and get a seat right away.  If you are into cocktails, they have fresh squeezed orange, which if you mix with Pinnacle whip makes for a great drink!  Only small complaint is if it gets busy, the bar is so big it can be tough to get the bartenders attention.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here with my husband for an after dinner birthday drink. We had just finished at Carpe Diem off Elizabeth and knew that on Wednesday's they have local draft pints for $2.50. Parking is a bit tricky so I ended up on the 3rd floor in front of Marshalls.   Once we were across the street and inside we picked a spot at the bar. My husband ordered an OMB Copper and I got the $4 special Crown Royal. We basically just hung out and watched basketball (March Madness). Our waitress was Amber, and she seemed to be the only working the bar, which was where the majority of people were. She introduced herself and asked us our names as well (a first for me). She was very friendly.   I would definitely go back to visit and for a drink."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with a couple of friends to watch the basketball playoffs. Silly us, because it was also the All Star Race before the Coca-Cola 600. They had all of their large TVs devoted to the drivers walking around in their fancy pants suits...yay....  They do have a nice selection of cider, for a pretty good price (most under $5). They have your typical bar food, which is typically pretty good.   During the week they have a drink special, but all in all this place is a take it or leave it, we came because it was convenient type place."}
{"text":"The service was very slow. It took almost an hour to receive our appetizer from the time we sat down. The food was very bottom of the barrel, not like the other locations in the Charlotte area. Our family will not be returning to this restaurant location."}
{"text":"This location is fantastic. My grandparents are regulars and adore the food as well as the staff who always go above and beyond to make them happy. Great customer service and atmosphere-can't get better than this!"}
{"text":"Coming here for lunch isn't something my coworkers and I normally do, not sure why after visiting, and definitely will be back.   After we were seated our drink orders were taken. Not too long after I was able to order lunch which included chicken tenders and a baked potato. You can chose for the chicken tenders to be plain or tossed in sauce, or for a side sauce bbq or honey mustard. On the baked potato comes butter, sour cream, chives, cheese and bacon. I only got butter on mine, but note you will have to ask for it on the side if that is your preference.   The food didn't take too long to come out. Once we got it I'm pretty sure my coworker was totally jealous of mine because it looked awesome. And it was. I definitely had enough to take home and have for lunch the following day.   The only hiccup during our meal was when I asked the waitress for butter she said ok and left. I am pretty sure she totally spaced because when I asked her again she said ok, but this time she brought it out.   I would recommend for lunch, hopefully dinner service is just as good."}
{"text":"The Hickory Tavern is a solid local chain to go to for some good pub food. I go here a lot and have eaten pretty much everything on the menu. I will highlight a few of the ones that are my favorites and some I don't recommend!  Chicken Quesadilla 5/5- Comes with a jalapenos, sour cream, etc. to add into the quesadilla if you want! Charred Plain Jane wings 5/5- AMAZING. They are such a hit with anyone I've ever gone here with Lobster Roll- 5/5 My Go-to item... I swear its the best one in town. You wouldn't expect it either. The bread is tasty and the price can't be beat Crab dip- 3/5 Average Sliders- 3/5 Tavern Potato Chips- 5/5 the sauce is addicting! Chips and Queso- 3/5 Black and Blue Burger- 5/5 Chicken Colorado-5/5 Tavern Salad-5/5  The service has been solid at all of the locations I have gone to. Most of the time, it has been excellent! It has always been excellent here!"}

{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant that serves meals nearly as disgusting as Hickory Tavern. Their chips are wet with grease, their wings are soggy and their \"food truck menu\" gives a bad name to food trucks. Not only are their meals absolutely terrible, they are also way overpriced. I have no doubt that if it weren't  for their convenient location, they would've gone out of business a long time ago."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to grab a late afternoon snack on the weekends.   I love that you can order half size of the appetizers ... perfect when you want something light, or you like variety (like me). My wife and I usually will bring our pooch, sit out on the patio overlooking Uptown, and split 1/2 order of the cheesy-crab dip and 1/2 order of the chicken nachos. The crab dip with pita is incredible. You definitely won't be disappointed. For 1/2 an order of nachos, you'd be surprised at how big they are!  I've been here for lunch and gotten the chicken and rice (it's OK, definitely not as good as the NYC food-truck version it tries to impersonate),the fish tacos (awesome choice), and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner.   This is a great choice, and one a nice day, you cannot beat that location and view on the patio!"}
{"text":"For a bar, this place is a must when we travel to Charlotte for hockey. It is a bar. Sports on the TVs, loud and fun. Good staff even when busy. Wings, burgers and brews. You will want to have a shot and stay a while."}
{"text":"Dry burgers.... we would have been better off eating at Wendy's. Beer selection was decent but expensive. Oh and my tater tots tasted like fish sticks."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and each time was pretty basic. Nothing overly exciting or fantastic but decent. I don't go out of my way to eat here but if someone else wants to go I will be okay with it."}

{"text":"Literally the largest junk beer menu I have ever seen.  Granted there are a few staples as well as a few locals on there, so all is not lost, but for crying out loud it is the dead of winter and style-wise all ya'll got is Guinness or a Milk Stout?  One of the most popular NC breweries is Olde Hickory - it's a no-brainer you should be serving a couple of those. To top things off, my waitress did not know the menu. at. all.  When I did finally get a beer, my Chimay Blue was served to me in a Pint glass (!)    Whoever created the beer menu needs to get out in the world or read a beer magazine...something.  I guess the beer list is a good match to the clientele..."}
{"text":"We love hickory traven we got there a good bit. I am not happy that the menu changed but it is what it is . The Dixie bootlegger is great.."}
{"text":"This might be a \"local\" joint but it feels like a chain. We met up with some friends for lunch and the first thing I noticed was the smell of dirty rags. Restaurants should smell like food not like food leftover.   We were promptly helped but the food was just average. I had a burger with fries that could have come from any chain in America. The salads at the table looked good but has very off combinations of flavors, not to mention they are served in a mixing bowl.   The positive was that there was good service recovery when wings came out bone in vs boneless. The staff were helpful and if your going to watch a game the TVs are all over. Don't hold your breath for the food."}
{"text":"So over this place lunch and not a soul in this place it took my waitress 10 min to even come to the table and once she dropped off my water and the menu she vanished into thin air so another waitress who saw me looking around and looking at my watch came over and took my order so  still why does it take 30 min for a hotdog and cold fries  this place sucks we really need somewhere to eat on this side of town that value their customers"}
{"text":"We are new to the area just bought our condo coming from NY. Food was great and great selection of brews! Staff was very friendly and helpful! Will definitely be returning with our guide dogs. Felt very welcomed."}
{"text":"I was asked to organize an informal dinner gathering for our office, and decided to go with Hickory Tavern. We had between 25 - 30 people RSVP so, I wanted to make sure to choose a place that served something for everyone.  The menu is good in this respect - plenty of appetizer options, salads, sandwiches, and all sorts of entrees.   They pulled several tables together for our group, and the only downside was that the tables were all in a line so it was a bit tough to socialize with folks at the other end of the table. I am not sure how to best configure the tables,  but I didn't really like the way it was set up.    The only other problem was that we had 2 servers assigned to our table, but we still found the service to be a little hit or miss.  I expected a much higher level of service for a \"corporate outing\" where we were ordering plenty of drinks, apps, and dinner.  The other disappointing thing is that we had our event on a Thursday night, so there was some sort of ladies night event going on.  This would not be a problem, except there was an abnormal amount of bar noise and constant annnouncements over a PA system.  This wasn't very conducive to conversation at the table.  I would consider giving them another shot for a future outing, but I would definitely avoid the ladies night and would want to check out how to better set up the tables for a group event."}
{"text":"I was at the restaurant on September 12, 2015 at approximately 8 pm. The service wasn't that great. I had to request for napkins, paper towel, eating utensils, and coasters for my drink, and my friend's drink. The waitress probably checked on me 3 times, I had to ask for other wait staff to bring me certain items. The restaurant wasn't busy or crowed."}
{"text":"On September 13, 2015 I was at the restaurant around 5 pm. The service was slow, after I was seated approximately 10 minutes had past and I hadn't seen a waitress. I went to front entrance and spoke to the greeter, afterwards a waitress came to my table to take my order. Basically it took 15 minutes from the time that I entered the restaurant to have my order taken."}
{"text":"Food is way overpriced, service is spotty and the food rarely ever comes out right. It's very noisy and echo-y. Especially when they do trivia. They are open late, but the late night menu is basic and even more overpriced than the regular menu. We'd eaten at this place several times...the food is pretty good when it comes out right...though still not worth the price. Last time we were there we all had B.Y.O.salads. My husband and step-son had to send theirs back twice because they came with the wrong toppings...my stepson had only ordered 2 toppings and they were still wrong!  $12 a salad and we still walked away hungry. Manager never showed their face to apologize, though the server did give us a small discount. Terrible customer service. We will not be back. We go to Brews now...it's 1000 times better!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed tonight for dinner. I ordered the peel and eat shrimp. The shrimp were either frozen and not thawed properly or they were prepared yesterday and served today. Thought the seafood was supposed to be fresh. Not the case here.   They were very tough and no flavor. This is somewhat surprising as I am a frequent patron and haven't had any significant issues. My family had salads and wings. There food was fine. Service was quick despite the restaurant really busy for the basketball games.   I did alert the waitress of the issue with my food. I told her this as she gave us the check. She didn't come by between food being delivered and check. Another disappointment tonight.   I will give HT another try maybe, but tonight was not good."}
{"text":"The music they play is so deafing you can't hear yourself think, it literally ruined our night. The service is less than good, the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"Mediocre service and worse food. Been here several time and the quality decreases with each visit"}
{"text":"The hubby and I went here to meet a large group.  They were easily able to accomodate our group at a super long pub table.  The inside of the restaurant seemed huge and the atmosphere was nice for a sports bar.  They have a pretty decent menu.  I ended up getting the smothered chicken with sweet potato fries.  My food was really good.  The sweet potato fries are pretty amazing because they drizzle some kind of sweet honey butter sauce on top.  The service was just ok, nothing outstanding.  Sadly the one thing that stands out to me for this restaurant was the sea salt hand moisturizer in the bathroom.  This stuff was amazing and left my hands nice and smooth after visiting the restroom.  They actually sell jars of the moisturizer at the hostess station but I couldn't justify spending $25 dollars for it.  I'll definitely be back to this restaurant to give it another try."}
{"text":"Ended up spending 2 days in a row at this location this past weekend.  A big compliment to your bartender Jordan.  Had drinks and lunch on both Saturday and Sunday afternoon.  Great personality and attitude.  She made our day!!  On another note- nice job managing the TV's on football Sunday.  All 9 of the 1:00 games were visible from our table!  Food was very good also.  Keep up the good work and keep hiring people like Jordan!!!!"}
{"text":"Have been to this location a few times and yet to have what I would call a good experience.  My first trip was on opening night and their entire draft beer selection was unavailable because there was a problem with the taps and had to drink bottled beer.  Not a huge issue, but seems like you would work out those kinks before a grand opening.  Over Xmas 2015, we went on a Friday night and were told 20 minutes for a table.  It actually took 45 minutes and was past my sons bedtime before we actually even got our food.  My Moms food never came because they forgot to make it.  This last time, last week on Thursday which happened to be the first night the NCAA was playing Sweet 16 games, my neighbors ordered a specific beer.  The waitress came back with mine, but told all of them they were out of what they wanted.  Then a second order for a different beer was placed and she came back and said that was out, too.  Once the beer fiasco was over, we ordered a 2nd round of drinks.  The manager came out with all of the beers and put the wrong one in front of me.  When I told him I didn't order that and told him what I did order, he took it back, but never brought me what I did want.  Fifteen minutes later, the waitress asked me where my drink was, so I told her what happened.  She looked at me in horror that the manager didn't make my order right.  Food was OK, but still had to wait an extra 5 minutes for my tots.  I guess making two things at once is too complicated.  In my humble opinion, there are leadership issues at this location.  The wait staff has always been pretty good.  I like Hickory Tavern, but feel like I can get a better dining experience from the food trucks outside of my office uptown."}
{"text":"I have never eaten a full meal at Hickory Tavern, but I have been in here several times with friends to grab a couple of appetizers and beverages.    The menu is typical bar food - not great but not bad either. I am always a fan of oysters and they offer them on the half shell.... yay!  They do have a nice patio that I like to enjoy when weather permits.   Service on my visits has been hit or miss. I have been several times when it is really crowded and it can be a challenge to get served.  However, on visits when it was not so busy, the service was very good.   In addition to all of the TVs for the sports fans, they also have live music on occasion.  The overall atmosphere is comfy and laid back but I think a little nicer than many sports bars."}
{"text":"Looks like a great spot ... i like the atmosphere.. service was good.. all around decent place for catching a football game with their t.v.s hanging in every corner. and the food doesn't upset your wallet or your stomach.... :) i will go back and try the salmon BLT .. that sounds wonderful"}
{"text":"Ate this twice while in the city. I was told this is a go to spot to watch the game.   Food was good and the menu was very decent. I'm a picky eater and was able to find something here."}
{"text":"Takeout took 30 minutes after 8pm on a Tuesday. No apologies. I'll let the food speak for itself. Photo attached. Yuck."}
{"text":"Don't know if the one bartender is a bar back or rookie but hasn't made one drink correct today. Ok the bartender is a rookie just saw him carry a bottle beer in the glass he was going to pour it into and tap a finger on the plate to se if they wanted more chips. It's a training issue."}
{"text":"We go as a team to this place every Thursday night after softball usually have great service. Last night was totally a cluster. Waitress was very nice and apologetic, I watched the one bartender work as hard as possible to keep up. We had 2 drinks in 2 hours waited on food for an hour (24 Wings). I approached the manager asked if he could give the bartender some help he said \" the kitchen is behind and that is where he was needed\". I then watched him approach bar pull tickets and rudely slam them in front of bartender and say \"Do these\". We also observed him sit and talk to his parents sitting at corner of the bar for 45 minutes (which they had prompt service) and neglect the atmosphere within the place. We usually leave seeing a full restaurant but we all noticed it was slow upon our exit. Policy: care for your staff, your customers and visit your parents on your time off. Lost our teams visit every week."}
{"text":"Absolutely not the place for lunch. What a shame, the Hickory Tavern used to be a great local spot for a sandwich or salad. Today a friend and I ordered quesadillas which were no doubt the worst either of us have ever had. After waiting more than 30 min, the waiter brought out something that looked like an 8 year old made it. After sending back the manager brought us new items but didn't offer to comp a thing! Shocked at the poor food quality and management treatment. There are plenty of other restaurants on Harris Road."}
{"text":"The food speaks for itself. No real quality control and subpar food. Especially for the price. At least the Guinness was decent. I paid an up charge for the tablespoon of guacamole"}
{"text":"I  typically LOVE Hickory Tavern and I know this is a new one but you should not open your doors if you CANNOT deliver the service you, as a restaurant, offer.  We waited 30 minutes to be seated which is fine but then another HOUR to be served the food that we ordered.  Our table was ready a 7:52pm exactly.  We got our food at 9:07 exactly.  My mother, who is a diabetic, was not even feeling well enough to eat when the food finally arrived.  We were just about to ask to pay for our teas when the food arrived at the table.  The waitress was running around (she was lovely) trying to keep her other tables from committing mutiny so we had kitchen staff serve us our food.  They basically threw the plates down on the table and walked away.  My loaded potato was hard as a rock.  My mother's California Chicken Sandwich did not have the avocado on it which was the main reason she ordered it.  This was a very disappointing visit.  To top it off, we asked to speak to the manager and he never came to the table.  By 10 till 10pm, we were just ready to go and did not want to wait any longer to speak to the manager.  The waitress was super friendly and she is the ONLY reason I am giving this a 2 star review.  If not for her, I would have given this a 1 star.  I will not go back to this establishment until they can get their stuff together.  You need to let people know what your kitchen wait time is.  Once you are seated, it is difficult to just leave.  If we had known that the kitchen was backed up an hour, we wouldn't have agreed to the 30 minute seating wait."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I live less than 2 minutes from this place and now I know why I never come here. It's a joke. First, the hostess didn't even greet us with a smile when we walked in, just sat us down and started texting on her phone. She was literally walking past tables on her cell phone, texting away... very professional. Second, me and my boyfriend sat down and waited FIFTEEN minutes for someone to even take our drink order. Finally, another waitress came by and asked us if we had even been greeted yet, I said no and she said \"I'm sorry, your waitress isn't here.\" And laughed it off like it wasn't a big deal that we had waited that long. What do you mean our \"waitress\" isn't here? Mind you it's right at 5 pm on a Monday night, It's not crowded and there was only about 2 tables seated once we got there. The only good thing about the whole experience was they only charged my boyfriend $1.00 for my burger since I assume they felt bad about our wait time. I won't be back though. A group of 3 frat boys came in and got their drinks before me and my boyfriend even did."}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to like this place, several sub par experiences with this location have left a bad taste in my mouth and will prevent me from coming back. If you plan to only go to the bar to order a drink and watch the game, this place is probably fine. However my experiences have been simple meals take a long time to be served and management has been less than stellar handling any issues that pop up.   I've been to this location probably 5 times in the last 3 years. Originally my wife and I were in love with this location as the patio is gorgeous, you have ample seating outside, and the build your own salads were a great, light alternative fare to normal pub food. On one particular occasion, I found a large piece of cardboard in my salad. Leaves me to question the prep staff of the place. Also the manager at the time seemed very laid back about the whole thing, and only comped my salad. I left that day feeling very angry and hungry as we had waited over half an hour to get the salad after ordering. It was a while before we went back.  We did try this place again recently and the experience again was just OK. We enjoyed sitting outside on a Monday evening, but experienced a waiter that was often nowhere to be found. Between the time we ordered our meal and got our check it was almost 90 minutes - a really long time for two people on one of the quietest nights of the week. Due to the consistent lack of a good experience, I unfortunately cannot give this place a higher rating. Hopefully everyone else will have a better experience than me."}
{"text":"This location is very VERY SLOW!!! If your rushing or in a hurry an don't have 2 hours to eat I would advise you not to go. Today I placed a to go order over the phone an was told 15 mins, I got there 15 mins later an waited an additional 20 mins. Luckily I didn't have to go to work"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed to say my favorite restaurant has made me upset. Not necessarily the restaurant itself, but the people working in it. My friends and I come to this Hickory Tavern on a weekly basis, I love the food, most of the staff, and the atmosphere. However, I have been informed that a waitress has been talking crap about my friends and I. Apparently she complains that we don't tip enough. Which really makes no sense, being that I usually tip at least 20%, while my friends always tip larger than I do. The only time I fail tip a large amount is when I don't have enough money. This waitress in particular might not know I'm a high school student with a minimum-wage job. If she wants to come pay my other bills, so that I can give her a bigger tip, maybe then she won't trash talk me. I find it funny she can complain about my low-tip amount, when I've had her serve me more than once, yet I've never complained about her inattentive service or lack of care for her job, which is evident every time. I find this even more mind blowing being that I gave my waitress an $8 tip on a $10 check less than a week ago. I was informed which waitress stated this information and I will be sure to make sure she's never my server again. I'd say her name, but she seems like the type to spit in people's foods."}
{"text":"These people run out of baked potato than anyone else I know! They're a restaurant. How can you run out of baked potato every time I order it? Theres a harris teeter down the street too."}
{"text":"Does what it does - better than most. Food is certaily adaquate. Staff is appropriate."}
{"text":"First time at this location and I was pleased to see a lot of families at 6pm on Saturday and staff was very pleasant and engaging. Food is consistent with other locationsand I always order fish tacos. Yet to try the oysters only because I'm a snob and weird about seafood from a chain. Parking not great, but demographics are better than the other 2 locations."}
{"text":"What a place. I haven't had oysters this good since I lived in Florida . This is THE place to watch football. I drive from Forest City to eat and watch games here."}
{"text":"Good place to watch a sports game"}
{"text":"Good Sports Bar...  I've been to this particular Hickory Tavern many times over the past few years.  Highlights: -Diverse menu: They really have just about anything you could want to eat at a sports bar.  Their wings are pretty good.  I like to get them charred for a $1 extra. -Phenomenal screen setup: I've been to many sports bars in and around the Charlotte area, and this particular Hickory Tavern has one of the best television layouts around.  Whether you are sitting at the bar or in the dining room area, you are never far away from a nice, clear, HD, flat-screen to watch the game of your liking.    Lowlights: -Service: The service is hit or miss honestly, and it seems like lately its more miss.  Of course this is my own personal opinion, but I feel like it takes the bar tenders a while to recognize new patrons when they walk up and take a seat.  It seemingly takes forever to get served that first drink, but once you do, you're good to go. -Parking: Due to the other businesses and establishments in this plaza, parking can often be tight, especially when big games or events are going on.    -Price/Specials: To me, their specials aren't really \"special\".  In fact, I would that this place is a bit overpriced as a whole.    All in all, Hick. Tav is a cool sports bar/restaurant.  You can't go wrong with the food here, even though the service is often spotty.  Not worth a drive in you are not in the area, but if you are, its a nice spot to check out."}
{"text":"I've been here several times.  This time I ordered the shrimp tacos and to be honest, they were pretty bland.  Had I not ordered the Brussels sprouts as my side, my rating probably would have been two stars, but those sprouts were delicious!"}
{"text":"Honestly feel like the food is all microwaved especially the food on the light night menu. The service is ok."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service, Great atmosphere. Always have a drink special. Always enjoy going to Hickory Tavern. The wings are great and if you want a twist to wing flavors pick two flavors and they'll mix them. Great place to meet for business or just to hang out."}
{"text":"First thing you gotta know about this Hick Tav location is that the parking can be atrocious given everything that Is The Met...it is what it is, accept that going in...  Second thing you gotta know....the menu is expansive and contains what I would call \"Deluxe Bar Food\".  It has all your standard bar menu offerings, but everything is a notch above what you might expect from a sports bar.  Take their wings for example, all of their flavors are great - from the Hot Buffalo style, to the Bee Stings up top.  But what separates the wings is that they offer them CHARRED!!!  That's right folks, for a slight up-charge, they'll throw them on the grill for a min or two and charr your wings for you - a step above.  LOVE is the first word that comes to mind when I think of the crab dip.  Although its served hot, thick and full of crabs (that what she said, I think, lol), its the warm pita bread that I really love.  When you first sink your teeth into the Colorado chicken, and it has a chance to melt over your taste-buds, you'll just have to be quiet, close your eyes, and shake your head - its that good.  The cali-Chicken sandwich is also phenom.    Third thing you gotta know...the service and servers are always awesome.  That's one thing I've noticed about this Hick Tav, no matter when you go - lunch, dinner, late night, yelp event, or what their level of busyness, the service is always great.  I've even had a fantasy football draft in the back room and my buddies and I were all treated like royalty.    Fourth thing you gotta know...BEEEEER.  Yea, that's right, know what kind of beer you like because this place has dozens of beers on tap from local, to national, to international.  It's a beer lovers paradise.  That certainly doesn't mean you're out of place ordering a cocktail of your liking either.    I'm definitely a fan of this Hick Tav location,  food + beers + dozens of flat screens = GREAT Sports Bar option near uptown Charlotte!."}
{"text":"This place is pretty out of this world. Ordered the gumbo and crab dip. The Gumbo was out of this world and the crab dip paired perfectly with the pitas. For the main course I asked the waiter between the fish or shrimp tacos, which I am glad that I did because the shrimp tacos were perfect. Waiter was awesome and very polite as well. Hands down would recommend to anybody looking for good food at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"The crab legs were delivered COLD and with no Krackers. No refills on drinks.  Waitress friendly but not accommodating in her profession. Spoke to mgt but doubt it made difference.  I hate leaving bad reviews because the person reading doesnt know the background or basis of my post. Check my other reviews"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and to watch a World Cup match. There were 5 adults and a toddler in our party. The staff was very accommodating. Our waitress was attentive and the food was great. I think their food prices are a little high for basically bar food ( sandwiches, burgers, etc).  The beer special ($2.50 locals on Thursdays) offset the high food prices."}
{"text":"Can I give less than one star? Hats off to Hickory Tavern for providing us with the most spectacular display of rudeness and poor customer service there ever was. sad. We like the other locations but this one was a joke. We we're actually laughing at how freaking terrible the service was. Don't go here."}
{"text":"We had a great first visit. The atmosphere was good (probably great for a sporting event as they had lots of TVs) and the food was great. I had Cedar Salmon and Oreo Cheesecake and my wife had Shrimp and Grits with Chocolate Tavern Cake. We enjoyed it and look forward to a future visit."}
{"text":"Good informal sports bar atmosphere but not too dark if it's a business lunch. And plenty of big screens if it isn't a business lunch or if it's a boring one.   I've been there twice and thought the service was a tad slow - nothing major, but probably not the place to going time is short."}
{"text":"good place to watch a game and friendly staff. Burger and sweet potato fries were pretty tasty"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Everything from wings to Salmon. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on July 7 around 3:10pm.  Hardly any patrons at that time and we decided to sit on the patio. There is a sign posted \"cigar smoking allowed after 9pm\". A patron is sitting on the patio smoking a cigar and I advised the waitress who called the manager over to talk to the patron. After the manager politely whispered something to the patron and walked off, he continued to smoke his cigar blowing the smoke in my direction. We were considering leaving at that point but after about 7 additional minutes, the smoking patron left so we decided to stay since we had already placed our orders.  A female walked outside and began to smoke her cigarette. After about another 20 minutes, the manager comes to our table to advise that the ingredients needed to make our appetizer was not in stock and we could order a different item. She did not offer to compensate and when asked why it took so long to let us know that the ingredients weren't available, she replied that they were \"trying to make it work\". At this time, we decided to leave but not before getting the managers name, Emily.  I'm sure she would have not made the smoking lady put out her cigarette either. Very disappointed in the service we received from the manager. We frequent this restaurant for their bee sting wings but I'm not sure if I will ever return to this location or hickory tavern in general."}
{"text":"Really wish they still had MLB package!  A sports bar without access to any MLB game?  Not good."}
{"text":"You better bring your parka in this place. It's so cold you feel like your in an igloo. The food is decent & they have food & drink specials daily. We visit here often.   Great place to watch sports. Lots of TVs and easy to view most of them."}
{"text":"Ordered take out a couple days ago. Ready on time. Order verified and chicken fingers were fabulous as always."}
{"text":"Wing were okay but serve is horrible.  Bartender was focused on friends and not paying attention to other customers.  Wait 30 minutes for a drink and never got a refill.   Would probably stay clear of this location and continue to support the one in the metropolitan. Speak with GM this morning and it seems like a tight ship when he is around."}
{"text":"First time eating at Hickory Tavern and I was pretty impressed. Food was delish & their bbq chicken nachos were amazing. Definitely recommend getting it!"}
{"text":"Went with my mom on Saturday afternoon. We sat in the bar area with Tim. He was great!!!! Food and drinks were just ok and Tim made up for it! We will go back to see him!"}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern has been our go to spit for kids and friends. They changed their menu so watch out for the $6 \"side salad\" well over half the price of my full meal. When I asked the female manager she said that's the menu price. Next time asks the price before you buy."}
{"text":"We came here after the Hickory Tavern at Rea Village was too crowded. We grabbed a seat at the bar and got a couple of burgers and beer. This is certainly not bad, but it also wasn't the best burger I've ever eaten. Overall, I'd say this is the place to go if you have a group that wants to watch the game and get decent food."}
{"text":"Slow. Service. Crab leg special should have stayed buried under the sea. Price is too high for 1 cluster refills with inattentive service \"We know they get cold.\" Per the manager on duty.  Here's a tip: If your customer specifically states she wants more, i.e. 2 clusters per refill, note she is not 5 years old. Also teach your servers to pay attention to the question, \"Can I choose any side?\" Otherwise, I don't expect an up charge on my bill. Not returning."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Great atmostphere!!! Great service!!! We were sat in the same seats each time and it was a spacious and corner but in the front section!!!"}
{"text":"Good dinner for the family. Friendly staff, a bit slow on the service end of things. Overall we'll go again."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and variety on the menu along with a tv on every possible spot equals a great sports experience ! The waitstaff are accommodating  and the food is delicious ... Everything from ahi tuna to fish tacos to fabulous steak salads they have it all ."}
{"text":"Fun sports bar with good food - Little pricy but worth it !  Menu has nice options and live music during the weekend makes it a bonus place to go for lunch or dinner ! Outside seating is nice and inside TVs everywhere ... Food choices are exceptional - everything from a burger to steak ... Not your average sports bar food ! Also has a Food Truck menu with specials to offer - two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about really. The place is clean well staffed and the food is average. Nothing to really make you want to come back. This is also a chain with several restaurants in the area. Seems like the are more concerned with a restarunt on every corner than a memorable dining experience."}
{"text":"I'll give it two stars for food.  But a lot of the servers need retraining. Kinda different feel at this HT. Servers all have attitude that feels like if your not spending enough money you're not worth their time. Bar is the worst. Not friendly vibe at all. Go to Ballantyne. Much better! Just found out about the Providence Road health review .... this location was rated #10 of the 10 worst health scores in Charlotte for the month of July 2017.  I'm taking back a star .... explains why my last order was so screwed up."}
{"text":"Went in Mother's Day 2017- busy but not slammed. Appetizer came out cold. Waitress brings my nachos out on 2 stacked bowls- looked in between them and the bottom bowl was from some other table and dirty. So I went to kitchen, showed her and she took it back. Brings out second nachos and it was obvious the same top bowl but the other bowl was still discussing and dirty! Yuck! Table next to us were served cold undercooked chicken wings. Good grief! Mgr comped the nachos- by the time they came out the kids were done eating and getting crazy....save your money and go anywhere else. Trail house brunch is fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"Started off with a dirty table only to be cleaned by the hostesses poorly. Food took. Way too long and most of it came cold. Waitress was ok."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch after buying some furniture at west elm. I walked in and sat at the bar. I was well taken care of during my visit, but the food was very subpar. I got the bbq chicken salad. The chicken was rubbery and lacked flavor. The entire salad was devoid of taste. The spicy ranch dressing was chunky and not good. The citrus vinaigrette (or some such vin) was so sweet it was like drinking a bottle of honey. I know there are tons of restaurants in the area so I wont come back here. Food is not good."}
{"text":"Bad service. I stood at the bar waiting to place a drink order and your employee just stood there. After several minutes waiting; I just walked out"}
{"text":"Great chips! Great place to study! They have a good bloody Mary and great service. I enjoy the small salad also. Its is fresh and inexpensive and tastes great."}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews here?  They have a nice beer list, lots of food options, and a great bar area.  Our server was attentive and was actually enjoying working; the prices were good.  I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern was a great place for dinner when we visited Charlotte.  I had the Tavern Burger (cooked \"Medium\") with fries and it was great. Probably one of the best burgers that I ate in Charlotte ever. The restaurant is great, they have a ton of TV's covering almost every sport from Hockey, Basketball, Baseball (and Football when it's Sunday) and covering every angle you look at. When we ate here, the heat game was playing in the background while we ate so it wasn't that boring. Atmosphere is great for lunch or dinner.  Sadly, when we got there our first server forgot my Sprite while he got the rest of our drinks. But then once our second server came, she brought it to me when she looked at the table.  It's like a Duffy's (a sports bar in Florida) but in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This location was aight... I normally go to the HT off of Harris to watch games and eat; and they're food is prepared in a decent manner.   As for the HT at the Cosmopolitan. Perhaps I ordered the wrong dish because everyone else's food looked waaaaay better than mine.   Let's start with the burger. I ordered the Pepper Jack burger and it was dry, no flavor, no pink...   I got like 9 fries on my plate and when I asked the dude for ranch; someone else asked for some honey mustard at the same time. She got this big black cup of it; while I got the smallest black cup of ranch. Oookaaay...   Normally, I'm not able to eat all my food. Perhaps I was madd hungry that day; but what should have been a regular food experience turned into an annoyance. I was there for a meeting, so I didn't want to ask for anything else; especially when there were like 13 other people in the group that needed their food, condiments, drinks refilled.   Perhaps I'll go back and get either the Black and Bleu Burger? and the Chicken dish that had mashed potatoes, and cheese, broccoli... like I said... everyone else's food looked better."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 stars. Food, service, consistency, comfort... solid 4 stars.   The hubs and I have been know to watch a game or two here on weekends. There are tons of TVs so chances are good that you'll be able to get the tv nearest you tuned to your game.   Servers are punctual and helpful.   Husband had the crab legs, shrimp, and oysters platter. He said the shrimp and crab legs were great, oysters left him disappointed though. I had the French dip... my second go at this same menu item. Last time it was fantastic, this time, meh.    We'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner. Greeted by hose. Friday night fairly busy. Allison our waitress stop by. She was perfect the whole night.. smiling, seem to enjoy herself. And I like the little chats and her interaction. That was a singer in the bar that night. Sang some good songs. Remember those from my younger years   I had the Tavern Burger. I normally get my burger medium. But ppl tell me it's best to get burger well done. So I did. Yet it's still very juicy and good.. Well put together burger. And of course the tater tots. If you mess up the taters, you may as well shut down the restaurant. I have been to other Hickory Tavern. This is one of the better ones.."}
{"text":"This is the place for me to go to when the Packers played before I ordered the NFL tixs on my Direct TV. Not because the food is off the wall great. But it's a great place for some apps, bar food and couple beers. Now if you're taking about good food, no I didn't say all that. It's subpar.   Restaurant: 4/5 they tried to keep up with busting tables as much at they can.. I do give them effort in trying especially when that's a game or a fight on.   Staffs: 3/5 some staffs can be a little better when it comes to customer service but I never got one that's out right rude or short. All are pleasant!   Food: 3/5 as far as bar food. Yes it's ok. I would need a beer to go with it.. I had the crab dip once. Didn't care for it.. my cheeseburger (twice) have ingredient(s) missing from it. Like the grilled onions.. I'm just too annoyed to ask for it.. Had the grilled salmon once.. Pretty dry. I guess they're trying to make sure that piece is die. Their chicken wings (bar food) is pretty good.   Hickory will be the place I'll go to if I want to watch a fight or hang with my friends for a game. But it's NOT a place I would recommend to take my friends if we want some good cook home dinner!"}
{"text":"I have frequented other Hickory Tavern locations throughout the Charlotte area but I must say, this location is the worst for service.  The food is well made but the service is lacking.  And my review is primarily on the lack of service.  On several occasions, my friends and I have witnessed food sitting on the counter under the heat lamps, in front of the pizza oven for long stretches of time.  For example, nachos topped with sour cream, sat in the window for 10-15 minutes and had several servers walk by it.  At one point, there were three servers having a conversation right in front of the nachos.  No one made an effort to deliver the food nor notify the server who needed the deliver the nachos to their table.  The last time we went, we ordered nachos and saw them sitting on the counter and by the time they were delivered, they were soggy so we sent them back to the kitchen.  On this visit, our server was sitting at a table gazing at her phone while we were trying to get her attention.  We actually had to get up and go to her table to ask her for our check.  We asked her if she was on a break and she replied, she was eating.  If you are on a break, wouldn't you let your table know that?  I would have understood if they were crowded and busy but it was mid afternoon and there were more servers than customers."}
{"text":"The food is just ok. I've had better bar food overall. The place is large and there are lots of tvs, so it's overall I great place to watch sports."}
{"text":"Best wings around. Wed night is wing night specials. I prefer them plain Jane and they are salty crispy delicious and I get bee sting sauce and blue cheese on the side.   The boneless wings made with bee sting and the Korean one are also awesome.   Lastly, wed nights is Alaskan crab leg night $30 for unlimited. Yumarama!!!"}
{"text":"Came in at 10pm for late night drinks and ended up eating way too much food. The service was great and all of the employees had a smile on their face and Heather who Is the GM came over and make sure we were doing ok and our server Justin was so funny and made us feel like apart of the Tavern family. The BBQ nachos were amazing and the french dip was perfect and get onions with it!!!! So many TVs and variety of beers on draft. Overall a great experience and it looks like such a fun place and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"A great place to watch the game have a beer and eat some good food. Came in around 2pm on a Monday and they were about 1/2 full and sat at the bar. Maria was at the bar and she was very friendly and helpful. Had a warm welcome attitude and the manager Heather stopped over too to make sure my food was cooked how I liked it. I got the french dip with added onions and it was perfect no day on it at all. Got a huge thing of tater tots and ranch. Overall a great experience and got to watch all the sports highlights. I will be back for sure. Had a great time :)$-$$"}
{"text":"We are regulars and have never had a problem. But Friday night we sat at a dirty table watching staff including 2managers completely ignore us without anyone even acknowledging that we were there! Nothing! Not even a \"I'll be right with you\". We say for 10-15 minutes and then left. Terrible!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't say too much about this place being that I usually am only here to watch games and grab a few drinks, but I'm kind of over it and going to look for another place to fulfill that need. The few times I come the service takes entirely too long and selection is very weak when it comes to food. The most I'll order is one drink, a salad, or some fries."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar and great wait staff.  Food is very good.  The steak sandwich is a great cut of meat.  The grilled wings are also fantastic.  I especially like the fact they have free Wi-Fi.    What is disheartening is the smoke.  Like most of NC eating establishments the bar area is filled with smokers.  The air handles do a decent job, but your clothes still smell in the suitcase when you get home.  Also, the liquor is a bit pricey so if you can bribe the bartender you get a better deal.    The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  But don't expect to eat on the cheap.  Choose carefully and you will do fine.  I will give it 4 stars when they make it smoke free."}
{"text":"I have to say really enjoy coming here! The staff is so friendly! Always try to accommodate and very kid friendly. Y go to place when we need to get out and not cook; so tired of fast food! Chicken noodle soup really good! Kids love the cheese burgers! Love the salad with the baked potato!"}
{"text":"Decent food.  Horrible and slow service.  Lots of staff hanging around talking to each other, but not working.  Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Really my rating would be 3.5, but that's not an option.  Though they're a \"tavern,\" they have a whole section devoted to dining.  That said, I think they need to work on the menu and add more options that aren't sports bar related.  For instance more steak or more seafood options.  Wait staff is usually very friendly and does a good job."}
{"text":"First of all I was already revisiting on a gift card from a prior visit to the Sun Valley location and this location was no more impressive I am done with Hickory Tavern! I ordered a chicken quesadilla, Tavern salad, and tater tots. The salad was delicious, the 9.99 chicken quesadilla literally as pictured had 1 chunk of chicken and 3 black beans SERIOUSLY?? My dad order the Tavern burger and salad when his burger came it was cheese burger and bun. He did not order it that way he didn't order anything special, my mom's burger came out fully dressed they got the same thing. We had to ask for his toppings,  Cold french fries. $57 dollars and 95% unsatisfied again. Not worth my time or my money."}
{"text":"Prices up quality down, I have been to this Hickory Tavern and other locations several times tonight we decided to pop over for an early dinner after a movie 5pm the restaurant was dead and we got the seat right by the kitchen door and also right beside the register the waiters and waitresses ring in orders there was a young guy who came in while we were there (he was an employee) he was just standing around messing with other employees right beside our table he reached out to grab a waitress he was messing with and he was so close I jumped because I wasn't sure what he was doing. It made our dining experience less than peaceful. I ordered chicken tenders which are called boneless chicken wings on the menu when they arrived, they looked good, but they were awful, there was so much breading on them it was like raw dough they were flavourless no seasoning blah. They took them back and I ordered a chicken sandwich and of course by the time my sandwich was done everyone was done eating and I was over it so I asked for a box. Our waitress was pleasant she apologized and they took the tenders off and charged me for the sandwich. Did I get a discount or anything NOPE. The salad was delicious, but $6.29 for a side salad is exorbitant 12.99 for bland chicken tenders isn't any better. Needless to say I am done with Hickory Tavern."}
{"text":"This place is the best! We had the best service and the best food! Our favorite place. We had there new flat breads and also the salmon is to die for! We will be back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"This place needs a serious customer service/staff overhaul.   My mom and I visited on a Saturday night this past weekend. It was not very crowded at all (no sports were really on). We got sat ordered our food and 30 mins later we FINALLY got it. Again, the place was NOT busy. The kitchen or the server forgot to put in my order. Did they apologize? Nope. Were just very factual that it would be coming out soon. Manager did a quick walk by and said the same thing. Oh and my food...was an appetizer. 30 mins for an appetizer.  But the thing that just was so ridiculous was that all the servers were doing their closing work at the table across from ours. Which also happened to be right next to the entrance. Why would the manager have them sit so close to the door? And as they were rolling silverware, two of them dropped on floor. One girl goes, \"you know you can't use those now\" and the other girl was responded that she knew that. But the first girl then said \"Well not everyone who works here does.\" - so that was interesting.  But because we got to sit across from them, I also got to hear all about their sex lives. Who was sleeping over at a guys house, and then someone else who decided her date wasn't getting any action.   Sit the employees in a different place, re-train them on etiquette when food is late, what's sanitary and what's appropriate to talk about in front of customers.   I will be going somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a while now and today someone either stole our credit card or lost it.. When we brought it up the best answer they could give was \"sorry. I don't know what to tell you\" .. Be careful if you eat here bc some shady stuff is going down.. Manager was way less than helpful as well .. We will be taking to the corporate office"}
{"text":"Understaffed!! Saturday night (known for sports bars to be busy for football) waited 20 minutes for a table of 3 to be seated when several tables were available. Waited another 10 to be greeted by server. Food was mediocre and took awhile. The place is cute & has a nice menu variety of bar food."}
{"text":"There's only one reason to come here. Alcohol and sports. The rest is marginal to poor. Its too bad. Its a good place to hang. If they could step up the food a bit and especially improve the insincere and unfriendly wait staff."}
{"text":"The hostess here decided to seat two parties who arrived after us, which caused us to not have a seat for the superbowl. Then when I confronted them about what had occurred they said \"well, it's first come first serve.\" This clearly means something different to them than it does to me.   On another note, the vodka redbulls that we paid $8 a piece for were 95% ice.   Very disappointed, won't return and won't recommend."}
{"text":"We live in the subdivision right next to here and want to like it at this restaurant so badly that we've been here 3 times in the last 12 months. Each time the food has been disgusting as well as the dirty carpeting. We came here tonight because we needed to eat somewhere close to home and agreed that it would be better to sit outside so we don't have to look at the nasty carpet inside. The hostess was nice and seated us. We sat with our 6 year old daughter and watched her color the entire placemat they provided and no one ever came to acknowledge us, take a drink order. We sat for about 15 minutes. Decided to pick up and leave and as we did I dipped my head inside to let the hostess know and she couldn't have cared any less too. The only restaurant we can rely on in this neighborhood is Saveedas apparently. Sorry Hickory Tavern, you guys are pretty bad all around and I hope a good restaurant takes the space over some day so we can go there!"}
{"text":"If I can give this place a negative star i would... the foods are not bad but the service is crappy as hell.  there are many other Hickory Tavern out there.  Maybe bad food but good service can make it up for it, but bad service can't be fix.  I give this place so many try.  Never again."}
{"text":"Watching NCCU vs Norfolk State Basketball. As stated watching not listening even though it is on multiple TV's.  The manager stated that they only do it for Duke,  Carolina, etc. Bascally white schools saying it is corporate policy. Funny how this does not happen at the other Hickory Taverns.  Sounds like discrimination especially with over 59 ppl in our section.  Asked for District Managers name and phone number, which she stated she could only provide his email address.  I am waiting on this and the corporate contact information to include phone number which I know she can provide.  This is truly discrimination in the corporate since.  Folks VOTE with your dollar STAY AWAY FROM HICKORY TAVERN ON MALLARD CREEK.  THEY DON'T CARE FOR THIER AFRICAN AMERICAN CLIENTELE.   Still waiting on this information from the manager."}
{"text":"I hate to give this bar and grill such a low rating, but the past few times I have been there, the service has been awful. My (now ex) girlfriend and I stood for 15 minutes waiting for the waitress to come and seat us. This would not have been such a problem had it not been 10 PM and there were only 2 tables with people at them. As far as food goes, it's not bad. Basic bar food, minus the pepper jack burger which is amazing. I will probably not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Pretty standard for a HT: Nice place, plenty of tvs, decent beer selection and even pretty good food. Unfortunately, same story in all other departments as well, however: slow to seat and serve you. A normal dinner out with the family becomes an all night ordeal. It's a shame seeing that everything else is a positive."}
{"text":"Decent bar food. Wines are pretty high in my opinion but Draft Beers aren't bad. Food is spot on BAR food. Don't go expecting anything fancy. Burger was tasty albeit SMALL (5oz?). Tuna app was decent but no mistaking it for sushi quality.   It is loud especially during game day.  Not a bad option when in this area...... just keep the expectations low....."}
{"text":"So who knew this place had all you can eat crab legs? Not many places in charlotte sell crab legs, so once I heard they sold crab legs here I had to go check it out. The have an all you can eat crab leg special..for that  they start you out with 2 cluster and a loaded baked potato. The potato was really good, I wish it had more bacon (bacon is life). I also ordered the crab dip for my appetizer, it was good but not good to make me want to order it again. While I came for crab legs I still looked over the menu and want to come back to try a few things I saw on the menu. They also have a pretty decent drink menu as well. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Hickory Tavern in years.  We used to go hit buckets of balls next door and then swing over for some drinks and dinner.  The years have been fine to this location, it was just as I remembered.  Located at the end of Rea Crossing shopping center just past the 485 exits on Providence Rd, if you are heading towards Waxhaw, it will be on your right.  If you are leaving the shopping center during peak drive times, or would rather not cross 4 lanes of Providence Rd, you can drive behind the gas station and hang a left, which will take you to a stoplight for safe crossing.  I was greeted by the hostess and after asking not to sit at a high top (I realize I am alone and will take up a table probably meant for 4, but I typically have on a skirt and no one wants to see that while they are trying to eat) I got a little bit of an eye roll, but that's okay.  Some girls get mad at how pretty I am, so I am used to eye rolls (ha).  Hickory Tavern is FULL of large flat screen TV's and usually have whatever the prime viewing for the time is on a huge projection screen on a rear wall.  When I was in around 6 on a Thursday night, it was SportsCenter (da na na) so I could read the crawl along the bottom of the screen.  I was quickly greeted by my server, Katlyn, and she was fantastic - my drink was kept filled and she checked up on me periodically without helicoptering around me.  As I put in my Tip for this location, I believe she said on Thursdays that shrimp were $.60 and oysters were $.75, bit since I don't eat either, I wasn't exactly tuned in.  The table next to me got oysters and he commented that they were tasty.    The food: Turkey Club w/ Tavern chips ($9.50):  Turkey with melted cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomato, served warm.  The bread, if you are a Costco person, is one of their torta rolls that are deee-licious.  The sandwich was good, and I like that it was served warm, but it needed a little more flavor to it.  Maybe next time I will ask for a side of BBQ sauce or the like to punch it up a bit.  The house made chips were thick sliced potato chips, crispy, but not hard and served with a slightly spicy dipping sauce - they were good and not overly salty, which was perfect.   Key Lime Cheesecake ($6.95):  This tasted like another Queen City Pastry dessert and was delicious.  Served with several swirls of whipped cream, this light key lime cheesecake, on a graham cracker crust, with a thin layer of lime sauce on top, was the perfect somewhat light dessert the finish the meal.    Excellent service and the food was slightly above average for this type of restaurant.  As it is close to home, I shall return."}
{"text":"First things first, awful service. I honestly considered jumping in and helping out. There were several tables waiting for their checks, you could see them scanning for their servers. The kitchen must have been behind because timing all over the front of the house, was off. Apps arrived with meals, or way too far ahead. Meals didn't arrive all at one time....it was just out of sync. This was all prior to us being seated.  I was in a group of 4 adults and two kids. We expected a wait and honestly, wasn't too long considering it was a Friday. Our waitress was in the clouds though. She got my order very wrong after I watched her write it down, word for word. Something as simple as chicken tenders, baffled her. I will give her credit for owning up to it when I questioned if I another persons meal.  The kiddos spilled two cups of water and no staff member was in sight to offer towels or new water. Luckily, tables turning was slow and there were paper towels left on a neighboring table.  A variety of items were ordered and nothing really stood out. The pretzel app was actually pretty good but otherwise, less than impressed. Considering the quality and quantity of food, the price seemed a bit off, too. Will definitely choose some of the new local spots before going back to Hickory Tavern. Generally, I give chains the benefit of the doubt since there are regulations and standards involved. I have visited this location on a few occasions and honestly, will only do so if I'm out voted among friends."}
{"text":"My SO and I were looking to have dinner and hopefully watch the Rose Bowl somewhere. He just moved in to a house in Davidson and the TV and cable haven't been set up yet. Finding a restaurant open on New Year's Day proved to be a challenge. We drove 20+ minutes to a restaurant only to be disappointed. I saw Hickory Tavern on our way and suggested we check to see if they're open.  I looked them up on Yelp before walking in. To be honest, I was very turned off by their 2.5 star rating and poor reviews. I was ready to walk away. Fortunately, my SO convinced me to stay. The place was not busy at all. They have TVs in every angle and they had the Rose Bowl audio playing throughout the restaurant. Same concept as Taco Mac. The hostess was friendly and seated us right away, by the bar. She then told us that our server, Brandon will be taking care of us. Shortly after that, Brandon came up and greeted us. He was great! He was very personable, attentive, and helpful throughout the entire meal. He kept our waters full and checked in on us numerous times.  We started with the (single) pretzel and cheese dip which was a seasonal special, I think, as well as pita and hummus. The pretzel was warm, soft, and adequately salted. I would even go as far as to say it was better than pretzels I've had in NYC and Philly! The hummus and pita were fine. We were not dining at a Mediterranean restaurant so I wasn't expecting amazing. My SO wasn't feeling well, so he decided to stick with the pita and hummus. Hungry, I ordered the Charred wing entree ($16). I was torn between getting medium hot and lemon pepper. Brandon informed me I could get half and half, so I went with that. They turned out just as described - charred. Brandon threw in an extra (medium) sauce on the side. He said sometimes the wings lose their flavor during the grilling process. He was right. I couldn't really taste the sauce on the wings. The other half did not taste as lemon peppery as I would like, but they weren't bad. Maybe next time I'll order the regular wings and not the charred.  Two other members from their staff checked in on us during our meal. The first one was female and the second one was male. We assumed they were both managers. We noticed them checking on other customers as well. The male manager personally informed us that the dessert we ordered (oreo cheesecake) was sold out. He was very apologetic and so was our server, Brandon.  More people came in as the game progressed. By the time we left (during halftime), I would say almost half of the restaurant was occupied. We left pleasantly surprised. We even told the male manager right before leaving how impressed we were with their customer service, especially with Brandon. Decent portions and reasonable prices. We will return!"}
{"text":"Came by Saturday night for a quick bite opting to sit at the bar section. Kyle helped us and all was great until the bill came. My husband noticed they billed him for an upgraded drink(old-fashioned with Crown)he didn't order that way. He tipped lower to compensate without taking time to talk to management. After leaving and talking, she also upgraded the charge on my house wine order to a named wine. Watch your bills people. Whether we got what we where billed for, I don't know; we didn't order it. She was pushing for a higher ticket=higher tip. Will not go back because of her actions."}
{"text":"I recently visited Hickory Tavern for its Music Trivia night.  I thought it music and trivia but sadly it was just naming the title and artist after listening to 45 second sound clips. Still a decent time but I sucked and rode my team's coat tails. The establishment is huge and clean. There were several servers tending to our large party so getting drinks was not a problem. $4 tall Blue Moons isn't too shabby either.  Only thing I can hold against this place is that its more of a family restaurant than a tavern. The actual bar is pretty small compared to the size of the place and the sound system was close to being inaudible."}
{"text":"Decent food selection, great bar, close to home, can't go wrong. An easy way to spend a Friday evening."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Hickory Tavern on Saturday night.  We have eaten here several times and never had a bad experience.  It was a little crowded but we were greeted by the hostess and seated immediately.  Someone came to take our drink order and explained that she was not our server but our server would be right with us.  Our drinks were delivered and our server, Kristen, came to take our order.  She was very pleasant, friendly and efficient.  There was a large party seated beside us and every member of the HT staff that came by our table smiled and/or spoke to us.  I had the chicken tacos and DH had the tuna.  Both were seasoned well and cooked perfectly.  It was a great dining experience and I'm sure we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits are good and gluten free. I like the build your own salad. The Caribbean chicken salad is delicious. The dressing is fantastic. Lobster rolls were a little dry. It was just the bread and the lobster salad. No mayo or anything. Other than that, food is good. It has a sports bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great sports bar. Great beer menu, great food, friendly staff; what more do you need? Gets packed during big sporting events, FYI."}
{"text":"Always a good go to restaurant when you don't know exactly what you want. Great beers on tap and good bar food, wings and some good entree selections."}
{"text":"Typical American sports bar.   Pros:  Good service and drink specials. We had a couple meetings in their private dining area and enjoyed the service provided by the staff.   Cons: the food is just average it's not horrible just not a favorite which is typical of most bars."}
{"text":"Love me some hickory BYOS!!!! Love the place and great attention, plenty of beer selection!  Also, wednesday its wings-day from 0,60$!"}
{"text":"Best local bar around. Besides the awesome service at the bar and the extremely friendly manager, the drink specials and TVs always keep your night exiting. It's the only bar in the area I actually like going to."}
{"text":"what the actual hell is this, how are you going to call these \"BBQ Chicken Nachos\"? Where's the bbq? Where's the chicken? I thought nachos had queso. Soooo confused, at how you can call these nachos. When I called the manager he stated, \"I've been making nachos for 4 years\"....well sir it's probably about time you find a new part of the restaurant to work in because this is \"nachos\" forte."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE HAS GREAT WINGS and I really love the manager Erin, she made my family and I feel at home and welcomed and she took  care of all of our needs. We will definitely be returning to this location. Food was hot and fresh and the drinks were amazing. Thanks for the Good service"}
{"text":"As hungry this area is for restaurants, especially dinner places, Hickory Tavern is quite a disappointment.  This is more of a sports bar than restaurant and it certainly appeals to the 20 - 40 year old single crowd.    We went for lunch and were impressed with how large and open it was.  The menu was pretty simple and sparse, without a lot of options.  I asked to look at a dinner menu and our server told me that the menu is the same.  Huh?  And as we tried to talk it became a competition with the loud pounding music blaring joining the multiple TV screens mounted around the room.  One of our club groups thought to have a meeting at this location and even though there is a separate room decided that we would not be able to talk even though the separate room had a French door that would close.  Our dinner experience, undertaken only to see if the experience would be different than our lunch, was worse.  More people, louder music, same limited selection of food.  Want a drink?  Want to meet young adults?  Give Hickory Tavern a shot.  You won't find us there."}
{"text":"Food has really good gone downhill.  Got a Carolina hot dog.  The meat was burned and they served it on a child's hot dog bun.  Tater tots were good.  Wife got chicken strips and they tasted like they had been fried in fish oil. Eggs in Tavern salad tasted old. Food there not as good as it used to be.  Would not go back except we love our waitress. Beer was good."}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss at this location. Most time that it's an issue they seem to be slow. Food is as I ordered. I would pass on the wings but everything else is fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night around 10 pm. It was decently crowded but we were seated pretty quickly. Our server was great and quickly got us water or anything that we needed. I got the jerk chicken sandwich with cheese and bacon, definitely worth it! The fries were decent, nothing special. The only complaint I have is that the music was too loud. I understand that it's a Friday night but we could barely hear ourselves talk. Overall I'd definitely go again and recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for me and I have never been disappointed with the food, beer selection and the service.   One of the times I went there, they took a little longer on our salads (Southwestern, which is delicious) so the manager came by and apologized and told us we can get any dessert on the house. It was a very thoughtful gesture.   There flatbreads are also delicious.   Definitely a great place to see the city from a different view after a nice walk on the greenway."}
{"text":"Visited with my family and everyone was satisfied. We decided to sit outside so that we could hear each other talk. It is a sports bar so it was loud but we were prepared for that and the staff was happy to accommodate us even though we were the only customers on the patio. I got a beer sampler where I chose 4 different beers and loved it! I chose the fish tacos and was not as impressed as I was hoping but they were still delicious and I ate every bite! The service was great and everyone else seemed extremely friendly. I want to go back and trying the oysters on the half shell! Will definitely be returning but will make sure it's to watch a game and not to have conversations with family I had not seen in months!"}
{"text":"We really like HT.  The bar is big and noisy, with high tops and tons of TV's. The dining room is good sized with tables and plenty of big cozy booths.  (Several tv's can be viewed in most of the dining room.)  Yep, it's kind of bar food... but I will say they have a great house salad (complete with bacon, tiny bits of ham and a sprinkle of cheese. It's like a little chef salad!).  I usually get that as an alternate to fries, but hubby loves their fries.  Honestly, our fave is their oysters!  $1 oysters (on the half shell or steamed) during happy hour.  And they have respectable wings too.  Not sure that I've branched too much further into their menu, other than burgers. Hubby gets sandwiches, and their pizzas look good, but haven't tried it.  Just kind of a fun, busy but relaxing place to catch a game or enjoy a beer and some good eats."}
{"text":"The service was good. The beers were good. Lots of big screens. But its a tad pricey. I ordered the french dip. Not impressive at all for $15. They kinda skimped on the meat in my opinion"}
{"text":"Hard to say the food is good. Never go a table. Watched for 45 min as large groups were led away to tables. It was only two of us to din. Watched as other couples walked out after large group after large group were sat at large tables. I waited all week to dine out."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Waited over an hour for food. Waiter never came back to our table after bringing our appetizers.  Actually walked out. Spoke to the manager several times and he kept telling us our food was \"on the way\" After 15 minutes we left. Spoke to the manager on our way out and he acted as if he could care less. Obviously he do doesn't.  Will NEVER go back and will certainly share my experience with others."}
{"text":"This hickory tavern rocks!!!   Rachel is the bomb. She is great cute sweet bartender. The Nacho's are awesome!!  Come here tip Rachel good. I love it here!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food friendly staff.  They just never play tarheel games.  Have to ask them it takes time to get TV channels changed.  We are on SC border just hard to believe no one watches the tarheels.  I love hickory tavern just need one that follows the tarheels"}
{"text":"Very good service and the food was actually pretty tasty. Oysters on the half shell, crab dip and shrimp and grits. We would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Good service, always friendly but today every beer Donnie has order they do not have. :-("}
{"text":"This location of Hickory Tavern gets an extra star purely for the outdoor seating.  This is a great place to enjoy dining on the patio!  The view of our fair city is great!!  As for food, it's ok.  I have never had anything that blew me away, but I've never been disappointed, either.  I enjoy their \"build your own\" salad menu, and the sandwiches and burgers are good.    The bigger draw here is the walls that are plastered with TV's, so, it's a bar scene.  At this location it's a trendy crowd.  The wait-staff was really good.  I very much enjoyed our waitress on my most recent visit.  This is a good place to meet friends after work.. and don't forget to take in that view!"}
{"text":"Having never been to a Hickory Tavern before but having been to Hickory, NC let's just say I didn't have big expectations. Yes I know they're not related but that's what happens when you name yourself after what I would refer to as an oasis of parking space. Seriously have you been to Hickory before? Tiny stores with gigantic parking lots for such a small town! If they ever have a population boom and everyone moves there, they'll be ready! Anyways back on topic to the actual tavern.  It's a sporty place, TVs everywhere, sports stuff and other things. The food was average bar food. I went on a Wednesday night which turned out to be music trivia night and 50 cent wings night. Alright lets go for the wings then! The hard part is actually getting the waitress's attention to get the wings. Seriously I thought I'd have to tackle her down to put in an order, but I'd probably tackle the wrong one. They all looked similar to me and I asked around the table and no one could remember what our waitress looked like either. After a good while we finally got our orders placed in and wings in front of us. I was just disappointed with my wings. So sad I had ordered a medium spice level on my wings which apparently translates to nonexistent and the sweet Asian glaze that I had selected really needed some heat to balance it out. A quick dunk into the blue cheese dip was a handy solution.  We won trivia night and got a $25 gift card yay! But I don't know about how I feel about coming back here for horribly slow service even if the food is ridiculously cheap."}
{"text":"Stopped by earlier for dinner with the family.  Was greeted upon entry, asked if we'd like to sit outside, booth, table or in the bar area.  We opted for a booth and were seated then our server took some drink orders from us.  The drinks came fairly quickly and the alcoholic beverages seemed to be fairly consistent this time.  We placed an order for an appetizer of the crab dip.  About 20 minutes go by and our server has not really checked on us.  I ended up having to grab the attention of the manager who was making his strides back and forth through the dining room.  He advised he didn't know what was going on with our appetizer but would go and find out.  It's my assumption that the app was sitting in the window because not 2 minutes pass and he's back with the app.  I will say that for like 11 or 12 bucks the portion was very small for a party of 4.  I'd hate to see the small app.  I believe we ended up all getting wings of some sort the others bone-in and I asked for boneless.  The others in my party are throwing back some mixed drinks and about 25 minutes go by we are wondering where the food is.  Food comes out one side of the table first then the rest comes about 5 minutes later.  Food tastes pretty good its piping hot and the quality was very decent.  I'm a bit confused about the boneless \"wings\" though because they seemingly brought me chicken tenders out which I didn't care but I don't know if it was intentional or they brought me the wrong thing.  Throughout the experience our server brought drinks to some of the others and 2 or 3 of them were too full and they were spilled on the table in front of me.  It wasn't that big of a deal but still, presentation matters.  I'd easily give them three stars for the food temperature and quality but they are seriously lacking in the speed of service, ticket times and customer care aspect.  I believe that some proper direction, training and management interaction with both customer and employees will go a long way here.  I can say the atmosphere was not bad they had music at a decent volume and TV's everywhere with all kind of different things showing.  Certainly not the worst experience overall but for the prices you pay I'd rather go somewhere else.  I just don't think that Hickory Tavern deserves my business because on the few occasions I've been here, there are not enough pros to outweigh the cons."}
{"text":"DONT GET TAKEOUT.  Food is always great, been eating here for years, but I have literally been put on hold for 5-10 mins every time I try to get takeout....I've complained to managers and made complaints online.  Nothing.  Walked in being on hold for 10minutes tonight, place is half empty.  Showed host and manager my phone on hold. Mgr said it will be brought up in the manager meeting tomorrow, 9/20. I sure hope it is because it's crystal clear that hosts are instructed to send takeout orders to the bar and bartenders are instructed to wait on all of the customers and do every other possible thing before answering the phone.   If the bartenders are too busy have the host take the freaking to go orders. All they do is take people to their seats.  It's been a trend for the last year at the providence location and one time I called the Ballantyne location since no one would pick up at providence I had the same issue and complained to mgr there as well.  Not everyone can make it in there to eat. Some people have families and small children. Stop telling your bartenders to wait so long to answer to go orders. It is clearly obvious that that is what they are being told by the trend I've seen. Listen to what we are telling you and make an attempt to appease all customers. your food is great but your service sucks in continues to suck and clearly nothing is being done about it.   Please read this and do something bout it.  I downloaded yelp to do this because it has been happening over and over and over again.  It's not all about money.  Restaurants are a hospitality business."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying this is the only Hickory Tavern location in Charlotte that I would recommend.  I have had mediocre to abysmal experiences at every other location I have dined at (5+ other locations).  However this location always seems to get the job down.  They have recently revamped their menu and offer a decent selection and quality of food. As this place is primarily a sports bar the TV setup is always important, and they do an optimal job of providing ample TV's facing in easy to see locations. They also have a good projector setup in the dining area.  I would personally recommend the nachos, they serve you heapings of it that is impossible to finish alone."}
{"text":"Ordered a fish and buffalo chicken taco--nice that they let me order two different tacos. 7 bucks for two tacos and a side on Tuesdays! Not bad at all.  The buffalo chicken sauce left something to be desired and the chicken seemed microwaved...  But the fish taco was nicely flavored and moist--thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is the first review I've ever written on Yelp but I just had to because Hickory Tavern deserves each and every one of those five stars I gave them! Hickory Tavern has great service and delicious food!! My server was Shawn S. and he was awesome! :) I'll definitely be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. It's a sports pub without the food that typically is thought of as a sports pub the food here was far better than any other sports pub I've been at. Very tasty excellent waitstaff good experience"}
{"text":"Now before some major menu changes this place would have been a good 3-4 star place. In my opinion the menu really kills this place. The food was good at best before and is ok now but the menu is limited and it really hurts this place in my opinion.   The beer selection is pretty good and the bar area is still great but I considered this one of the places to go eat a decent meal and get a good beer. I cannot see myself going back anymore due to the lack of menu.   I mean the food still is not horrible but it just is not what it used to be. But if you do need a good beer give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Went there last night.  We waited ten minutes to get drink orders. I think this was a problem with no one being assigned to us.  Once we had a waitress the service was above board.  Great croissant bread.  The big problem was the kitchen.  My daughters chicken was not cooked all the way.  The manager came out and apologized and asked if she would like something else.  She just wanted the chicken, but when she got the cooked through version it was rubbery and salt soaked.  Worse part was the bill.  I was shocked to see not only were we charged for the chicken, but we were also charged over 7 dollars for 2 helpings of bread.  The bread was great, but not $7+ great. I've never been charged for bread. I was okay with a charge of a buck or two, but $7?  For the priceof the total meal we could have sat down at a good local restaurant and gotten much better food."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food as we never got any. Came in and waited at the host stand for a few minutes...finally got seated. Sat and chatted and looked at menu, there for at least 10 min. No one ever even came to the table, so we left."}
{"text":"When you are in a hurry - never go to a restaurant you've never been.  My husband and I had 50 minutes before an appointment and decided to grab a \"quick\" bite.   We advised the hostess and server we were in a hurry and asked if they could get us out in 50 minutes.  They assured us they could.   We ordered 2 salads and two cold sandwiches - (nothing that needed to be cooked awhile).  We waited over 30 minutes for the salad!  When I left after 55 minutes are food STILL wasn't there!   My husband waited for the food - and when the server delivered it his dish was cold as her attitude towards the fact I left. She could have cared less that I left and he had to ask her to box the food up.  She never put plasticware or napkins in the bag. I ordered \"lobster roll\" which was clearly imitation and it was soggy.  My husband had fish tacos which sat under the heat lamp and were chewy and mealy.   The restaurant was not even a quarter full and the wait staff was standing around (well our server had disappeared)  As someone who spent a great deal of their working life in restaurants if you can't deliver on a promise - you should at least let the table know.   Very disappointed and we will not return... I truly wish there was a negative star system not only for the food but for the absolutely horrible service!"}
{"text":"Gross and greasy. Everyone in the area talks about how great this place is but I have been disappointed twice."}
{"text":"I love Hickory Tavern.  As a matter of fact, I've gone there the past 2 years on Mother's day.  There is something for everyone, and they give moms a rose :)  I love this place!  It's simple, fun, good, and worth it!"}
{"text":"A solid go-to for always good food, above average service, full bar, and plenty of TVs for sports.   We love the food truck menu, especially the chicken and rice meal that I've been getting for a few years now it seems. The roasted brussel sprouts with bacon are excellent, one the reasons I keep coming back!  Depending on the location, the service can be better or worse. There can also be a long wait on busy nights also for the smaller restaurant locations."}
{"text":"We went there last night service incredibly slow , some food items never showed up or showed up after we had eaten most of the main entree. They weren't even busy. The food was mediocre. They have work to do if they hope to stay in business."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern is the type of place you go to grab some beers, eat some tapas style food and watch the game. Most expect it to be this wonderful dine in restaurant which is why I suspect they place the more 'meal' type items on the menu. But people, it's called a tavern, you don't go here for your cordon bleu, you go for the bbq wings and pints.  With that disclaimer, I enjoyed everything about Hickory Tavern.   I had the bbq wings and my fiancé has the baked potatoe. Temperature wise they were hot and had plenty of meat on the bone. The baked potatoe was mild in size, but packed many toppings inside. My fiancé stated it may have been the best she's had.  We sat at the bar to be able to watch a baseball game. We had some of their beers on tap and a couple mixed drinks. They were spot on with the amount of alcohol and mix. The bartender talked with us frequently, bet never enough to intrude on our evening.   I gave this 5 stars simply for all those reasons. Great atmosphere, but go for the right reasons. Not for a date, not for a family gathering (unless you're diehard Red Sox fans)."}
{"text":"So yeah I've eaten at various locations of Hickory Tavern over the years and so tonight when I needed a quick bite to eat I popped in to this one. Now as a fellow Yelper I trust the reviews I read for the most part but decided to assume this experience would reflect my previous ones except...NO.   First, sanitation score: 94.5  Second, no greeting. We finally seated ourselves  Third, slow service   Fourth, greasy app plates  Fifth, nasty staff: I literally watched several different staff come out of the kitchen scratching their hair, rubbing and picking at their faces and one girl LITERALLY picked her nose at the bar while waiting for a drink order and LITERALLY rolled whatever she dug out between her fingers OVER the damn drink garnishes!!!!! WTF?!  We told our server who told the manager but came out and said because the girl was now off the clock they couldn't do anything. The manager came and apologized and said they threw away the fruit and that it's not how they are here. BS. I SAW WITH MY OWN EYES.   The food wasn't great at all. I ordered the charred wings and my partner tater tots. It literally took 45 minutes for no clear reason. The kitchen staff was cleaning and scrubbing and I guess breaking down the kitchen 4 hours before close. The tots tasted like they were cooked in old grease.   Overall I just didn't feel comfortable because I felt like the staff was unsanitary. I won't be back to this location ever."}
{"text":"They have plenty of TVs.  The beer selection is long and the food is average.  It was weird - with all the TVs on and several football and basketball games on, they were playing easy listening modern pop on the overhead speakers - really?  Good for beer - eat the food only after you get that buzzed hunger going on..."}
{"text":"I've been to other Hickory Taverns and this one has the same food, nothing different here, just above average bar food. I do like the Tavern Chips. The cool thing here is the location and it appears that the walls are nothing but TVs. TVs are everywhere!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food service is slow even though the restaurant was relatively empty. They brought out our appetizer which was chicken wings and did not bring and blue cheese or ranch dressing we had to wait to get the servers attention and then she finally went and got it for us, this should have been something that automatically came with the wings or at least offered. The burgers were very greasy and the French dip was extremely salty. I asked for lime in my coke but never received it so I just let that go.  The restaurant is was too expensive for the food quality and noise you have to put up with. We wanted to go there for a while but always went to other establishments and now that we did go we will not go back again as there are so many other better restaurants now in the area."}
{"text":"The female bartender is extremely rude.  The customer next to me waited 10 minutes to even be greeted, and them he said \"ma'am\", and she turned her back to him and put her hand up.  I haven't even tried the food, but there is no excuse for poor customer service."}
{"text":"I stopped here because they have oysters on the half shell.. they even have the name \"raw bar\" on the building side.. however, these were some of the worst oysters I've eaten.  Taste like water and an old rag. Gumbo was nasty also Omg... so by the end of the dinner we ended up having to reach out to the manager because the waitress -- was extra rude.. 1st off, she gave us the wrong bill.. then we asked for sweet tea Togo (since we never got a refill at the table) she brings us sweet tea with NO ice in it... then when we ask for ice.. she slammed it on the table and walked off .. manager didn't do nothing fix her mistakes and apologized .. if I cud I wud rate a 0 at this point ."}
{"text":"Our waitress, Camilla, completely abandoned us after putting in our initial beer and food order. She never brought the water I requested (I ran a half marathon this weekend--give me a break! I need to hydrate) and then she just wrapped up her shift and transferred us to the closer without so much as an eff-you.  The crowd here was really young, but that's probably because they were all home from college seeing their high school friends again. The bar has a great TV situation--we were sitting at a table in the dining area but still had a perfect view of UNC losing to UNLV. Womp.  We had 20 oz Blue Moons on special and a half-order of nachos. I love nachos (side note: I have gross eating habits) but these were pretty unimpressive. They should consider using liquid queso as the cheese base so the other ingredients don't get inextricably glued to the chips on top."}
{"text":"Slow service every time, and food has been cold twice. Poorly managed version of this chain. The Rock Hill location is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have probably been here 30 times. This review is based on overall horrible service and decent food.  Some servers and managers are good some are horrible, and the food is always average to slightly above average but that doesn't make up for the multiple times I've been here and Sat for 30 minutes with no service from anyone"}
{"text":"Awesome! Had a great time and the Pow Pow Shrimp are better than PF Chang's! Great service, which was super speedy. Place seems well kept, which is high praise for a sports bar. Super happy I chose this place instead of Outback! Only con was that it was spendy, but still totally worth it."}
{"text":"You can always  count on  Hickory  Tavern   to be open late on a  Sunday  night  and have a decent  menu . Thankfully  there isn't  any  karaoke  like Char Bar 7, where little  kids were singing  country  tunes and none of  the  staff cared if you wanted  anything  to  eat or drink.  Justine  is our server this  evening. She's  a  very  polite and professional  server. Our drinks were on the table  within  5 minutes  of  the  order  being  placed. Tonight  I'm  having  a  tavern  burger  medium with  fries and  thick cut bacon. My wife is  having  the  teriyaki  wings. The atmosphere  is casual  and medium noise  wise. The food  was  on the table before  I  knew  it  and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Was it that crazy of me to expect the Hickory Tavern to carry some Olde Hickory beer on draft? Am I wrong? Am I wrong? Okay then.   So after that initial disappointment, a Coke suited me just fine.   This place has a nice little patio for outdoor eating which we took advantage of so I didn't catch much on the inside. Our server was very friendly and good. The buffalo chicken taco sounded tempting, but I went with some sort of pepper jack burger with fries and left feeling happy with my decision, and typically when I end up ordering a burger, I leave with regret most places. She did bring me a side of hot buffalo sauce as requested that gave the meal a little more flavor.    Decent spot."}
{"text":"Man, this place is terrible. The food is run of the mill mediocre but the service is some of the worst I have ever experienced. Since I live close, I've been a few times but alas no more! Every single time I've been, my order has been wrong (how do you mess up a standard menu item with no customization at all?), the wait staff is demeaning / unpleasant, and it takes an unbelievable amount of time to get your food and cash out (even when it's completely empty) (the wait staff usually huddles at the front and chats while you slowly die with your credit card and bill in hand).  I thought it would be a decent place to watch NFL on Sunday's. However, getting a table is like the hunger games and the waitresses don't even clean off the tables between parties. Also, get this- they have a DJ blasting music during commercial breaks. I mean, it's just comically bad.  The only reason I haven't rated this place one star is because I haven't gotten sick from their food.  All we can do is pray that they go out of business and a duckworths takes over."}
{"text":"The manager Amanda checked on us multiple times.  Lacey our waitress was fantastic.  We definitely will be coming more often.  The new ribs were amazing.  I'd recommend this Hickory tavern for family, a date or even a corporate event.  They definitely have it together here."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Only place local in the Indian trail/sun valley area with a good beer selection.  Typically have several taps featuring local breweries ( triple c, birdsong, noda, etc).  And the bottle selection is pretty good.  Food is fine, typical bar food with some extras added in.  Great salads and entrees as well.  Wait staff is always great and now that it is warming up the patio is a fun place to eat.  Plenty of televisions I watch the days sports as well."}
{"text":"Restaurant has a nice atmosphere and is clean.  Food is good but not above average. Staff was friendly. I really like the brussel sprouts and the grape salad sides. They didn't have the ingredients to make the grape salad which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Not on a Sunday afternoon. Hickory Tavern has the potential of being a cool neighborhood bar. But it is not a Sunday afternoon family restaurant. The service was slow and inattentive. The food was mediocre. Everyone was in a days and forgot about why they are there. A good restaurant should seat the patrons as quick as possible, offer friendly fast service, and deliver high-quality food at a reasonable price. According to these criterion Hickory Tavern failed on all counts."}
{"text":"I've been to numerous Hickory Tavern locations around the city of Charlotte and surrounding towns and this is probably the least impressive location that I have been to.   After being seated - we waited a total of 10 minutes before someone came over to our table to ask us what we would like to drink. The food is overpriced for the quality that you receive. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with fries and the sandwich was incredibly bland and it was served with a side of blue cheese dressing. The dressing looked and tasted as though it had been sitting under a warming lamp because the temperature of the dressing was rather hot and there was a film that covered the top of the dressing. I chose not to use the dressing.   Needless to say I probably won't return - which disappoints me because I was pretty happy to see an establishment open in Indian Trail with a good amount of craft beer on tap."}
{"text":"This place is more a bar that happens to also serve food. Great selection of beer, with mostly mediocre food. Build your own salad is nice. Good selection of standard kids meals. Lots of sports on tv. A tad pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"So bad compelled me to download yelp app and write review. Went for lunch with family (wife and 3 young boys). We've learned to not be picky as our crew can be a little rambunctious. First off in an empty restaurant we were seated directly next to the kitchen in/out door. Next the waitress spilled water on my wife and table. Then when asked what the specials were I was told \"um, not sure let me check\". My food (turkey club) was eatable but my wife \"salad\" consisted of brown lettuce. The kicker is that my boys (2 and 4) didn't eat their hotdogs because they tasty \"yucky\". How can you mess up a hot dog????  Seems to be a good place to grab a beer and watch a game, just don't eat."}
{"text":"The best Delmonico steak, asparagus and crunchy Brussels sprouts with bacon. Steak was perfectly cooked, great portions, not overly seasoned at all. It's crowded so I ate at the bar but the staff was friendly and attentive. I definitely like this HT over the one in Waxhaw I think? It's smaller but the food is better. Just expect a wait. Plus it smells better here than the other location. Almost a five but  I wasn't happy with the wait or that they can't let you sit at a high top because they have to seat you. If you are a party of one, I feel they should be able to get you in. Still, I'll be back and highly recommend this location. Even if it means I have a longer wait lol!! No place close to Indian Trail to get a good steak."}
{"text":"Really wish I could give 0 or negative stars.  The food was a 2.  Nothing you couldn't get anywhere and nothing special.  Bland.  We had wings and tacos.  Maybe I expect more from tacos and wings.  The service was a 3 friendly for the first part and downright rude for the ending.  My party was treated very badly when we had a simple opinion.  I travel all over the country and have eaten in every state except Alaska and I will never set foot in this place again."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews about places like Hickory Tavern, but hey what the hell?!  This is your typical chain sports bar situation with the big TVs, the beers, and the random pop music in the background.  It's a bit nicer and pricier than some of the other sports bars, but at the end of the day it gives you essentially the same things.  There are locations all over the Charlotte area, and I assume they are all just about the same.    My favorite thing about the joint is that I always know what to expect.  The food is always solid, the service is pretty good, and there are food/drink specials.  If we are looking to have a couple beers and watch a game, this is the place we go.  In terms of the food, the burgers are good and they also do some decent shrimp and oysters.  This place went up a notch in my book recently when it finally got on board with the local craft beer scene and started carrying NoDa and Birdsong to go along with Olde Meck.  Better late than never.  So, if you are fellow Southwest Charlottean in search of local beer, you can add this place to your list of options!   Pretty good, but not great.  That about sums it up."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern is a Charlotte-area sports bar staple.  This particular location at the Met is the one where I have most often gone to eat, drink and be merry.  It's nicer than some of the divey sports bars you'll find, but still reasonably priced.  If you're familiar with the Met, you know that parking is awesome (note the sarcasm).  There's a deck across the way and you may want to give yourself a few minutes to wind through the rows to find a spot.  Once parked, things will improve as it's just a quick jaunt across the street.  One of the things I like about Hickory Tavern is that I always know what to expect.  They have a pretty good menu with enough different options to satisfy most folks.  I usually go with the burger, the wings (Korean BBQ), or the chicken tacos.  They also have an extensive draft and bottle list with local options, regional, and beyond.  Service can be hit or miss but more often than not it's pretty good.  We generally don't have to wait for a table which is another plus.    You'll find TVs everywhere in this place.  In fact, I doubt that there is a seat in the house that doesn't have a clear line of sight to a TV screen.  If you want to watch a game (or many games at the same time), this is a great spot for that.  All in all, a good sports bar with reasonable prices, quality beer selection, and some solid eats."}
{"text":"Came here on two separate occasions and each time I experienced a problem. The first time the waiter had us sitting for 30-40 minutes before coming over to take our orders. The second time I ordered a Ribeye and it was burnt. Had to drive back to get it replaced. The manager did compensate for the inconvenience however which was a plus. Food is pretty good otherwise."}
{"text":"Ate there last Sunday. As usual, good food,great service. Our server, Bren, was exceptional. Beer was super cold, just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Used to love the Hick. Good food, good service, and good schmekels. Then...lost all the good servers, raised their shot prices, and just overall sucks now. Totally not worth the money"}
{"text":"This restaurant's only redeeming quality is a wide selection of beers. Service is spotty. Bartender was eating and drinking at the bar. And an Orange Julius drink nonetheless! The Create Your Own Salad was wilted, not made to order, pineapple was brown, chicken almost undercooked. The Hash-brown fritters called Shred Heads (yes, I know they are fried) were extremely greasy, drippingly so! The rice in the Skinny Chicken plate was softer than your granny's hind end. The waitress was excellent though, this time..."}
{"text":"Decent sports themed bar. Food is good, a small step above all \"bar\" food. However, (you knew it was coming...) if you're a \"sports bar\", you can't have four TV's behind the bar playing the same thing, unless it's Super Bowl Sunday. (It wasn't)  What's more, they were all on ESPN News, showing NOTHING.  I'd come back, but if they can't get their act together, and you want to watch a certain event, beware!"}
{"text":"The food here is very over priced for what you are getting. It is very bland and basic. Save your money and go some other burger place, you'll get the same food for cheap. The serves is very rushed and slow. Good luck"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Springhill Suites right across the road. Loved that we were able to just walk to dinner here at the Hickory Tavern (.1 mile walk)!   We expected the place to be packed but it wasn't and we were seated immediately! This location seems way more spacious than the Winston one!  Food was excellent! We hadn't eaten all day and went with the small nachos to start. Huge portion for $6! Highly recommended! My husband and I both got the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and it was terrific. He then got an order of wings \"to go\" to have at the hotel later that night... Which he said were very good as well!  Service was friendly and fast!  We walked the plaza area after eating to help the food digest before heading back to the hotel.   We had a great night! Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Seriously just want to thank you guys for being open late! My dad and I had a 10 hour drive today and we deliberately didn't stop to eat just because we wanted to get home and we knew you were open late for food so we stopped in. Which was amazing after a long drive and having to eat fast food for lunch. Again, I appreciate you being open. The food was amazing as was the service even so late at night. THANK YOU!!!!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place but......they never get out \"to go\" order right. I hate having to check each time but glad we do. Also, they over serve which is hard to be around. At least the staff is nice!"}
{"text":"Good food, but the menu is getting a little stale, the prices however are rising.  They have recently bumped up their prices on menu items, and it just ruins the value equation of eating here.  I would recommend going on a day when they have specials (you can visit their website, or call in to find out what the specials are).  If you are a chicken person I highly recommend the California Chicken sandwich (I would leave off the mushrooms), and a baked potato.  The break gets a little soggy so you may have to \"Fork n Knife\" it but its only because the chicken is very juicy!  The baked potato is delicious and comes with a salted skin which goes great with a side of sour cream.  Beer/Alcohol can get pricey here if its not on special, but they do have a good selection.  They have TVs everywhere so we enjoy going when there is a game on, the atmosphere is great on these days."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite spots for years but I am sorry to say as of tonight I will not be going back.  The house vodka (Relska) cocktails were obviously watered down.  Ron, the manager, half way attempted to help and compensated a couple of  drinks, but the end result was less than stellar.  Eventually ordered two chardonnays to try and get a slight buzz as the four previous vodka cocktails provided none. Our group, who have been meeting here regularly for years, have agrees to chose a new spot for future gatherings.  Such a shame.  This used to be a great convenient place to meet friends for cocktails and appetizers.  No more."}
{"text":"Great food & great service. Met my hubby here for lunch with our daughter. There are tons of big screen tv's to watch, and they are great with kids. Our waitress was super friendly & recommended top fave's. I tried the shrimp & grits. It was yum-o! A lil too many onions for me, but other than that it was great.  Really good choices for kiddos too! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Our movie starts soon so will make this quick:  Excellent service, from everyone from greeter to server to manager on duty. We arrived indicating we would be catching a movie next door and just wanted some quick fun appetizers.   Knocked a star off for outdated booths, which also didn't feel secure and sturdy. I mean, I didn't feel like they would fall apart under us, but the wood and upholstery were definitely worn. Hope they replace them. I prefer booths whenever present.  Broccoli was deeeelicious. Barbecue chicken nachos were radiantly presented, and all ingredients were fresh, but nachos + barbecue sauce + other ingredients = Fail. The flavor combination was just wrong. Knocked another off.  And now.....Captain America!!!!  Bye."}
{"text":"We love hickory tavern! This is a great location and Justin is our favorite server! He's so helpful and always remembers our favorites! Linda's turkey melt and the lobster roll are yummy! Sweet potato fries- I recommend skipping the sweet sauce or getting it on the side!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at this restaurant last night and there were just a comedy of errors.  The first appetizer we order which was the quesadilla and chips, sauce was lumpy and cold with chips that were salty.  Then our pretzels came out frozen in the middle.  Needless to say, they were apologetic and brought out another set of pretzels that was cooked thoroughly.  We thought that the worst was behind us, well-my southern burger was cold and I think someone spilled a lot of salt on the patty so it wasn't edible.  Since, we had already sent back two uncooked appetizers, I just left the burger and fries without complaining.  It was late and we were to tired to wait for them to get things right.  We don't know if this was just and off night or the norm for them.  It will be along time if ever that we eat at this restaurant again."}
{"text":"What ???? Check out reviews ... All Women --- who don't know anything about what a \"good bar\" is .... Place is Way over priced for drinks - wait staff is marginal ..... It's like a bad Applebee's.  Managers are non existent- Bartenders are rude ..... Just don't get any good vibes here --- these places are One and Done.  Ps - hiring high school aged girls as \"hostesses\" is almost creepy. Then again - the place IS creepy."}
{"text":"I have had good experiences at HT, but this one was mediocre. I went on a Thursday afternoon, around 4:30, for drinks and appetizers. Our server was very attentive and friendly. The chips and salsa came out cold and a little stale. There was also a small piece of old chicken underneath the chips. The chicken tenders came out dark and overcooked on the outside and a little undercooked on the inside. Our server took it back and the manager came out to apologize. She said they didn't bread it correctly and the outside burnt. They gave us new chips and tenders, which were much better. I was a little surprised they didn't comp or discount anything. It wasn't a terrible experience, but it wasn't my best either."}
{"text":"How come the rating is so low??? How can you not love this bar???!!! They always have a great beer selection and awesome monthly drink specials.  The new food truck menu is amazing (reminds me of home) and the shrimp and grits are to die for. Seriously! If I was on death row hickory tavern shrimp and grits would be my last meal."}
{"text":"Horrible service sums it up. I brought my family here for the first time on Thursday. There were two, maybe three other tables in the entire restaurant, a few tables outside, and a few people at the bar. The place was basically empty. It took 20 minutes to get asked if we wanted something to drink. Another 20 minutes to get the drinks (one and only round), and another 40 minutes to get two orders of chicken wings and a grilled cheese. I generally receive more attentive service at Ihop or Waffle House. Writing this negative review with a history of restaurant experience myself. If I was ownership or management, I would be fuming mad. If I could give them less than 1 star, I would. Understood every crew is entitled to an \"off nite\" too - but when that happens I simply expect friendly service to make up  for it - and when a restaurant is empty, there's really no excuse, period."}
{"text":"Love their food! Always get wings and salads.  If you are a girl at the bar, hopefully you get a guy bartender... Otherwise you could be sitting there a while..."}
{"text":"I thought the food was really good here and the place looks like it would be great to come to whenever there is a big sporting event taking place.  They have so many tv's, we will definitely be back during football season."}
{"text":"Had a great time ! Started with hummus and a dales pale ale and then moved on to lobster roll and tots of me & shrimp and grits for wife. All while watching MI VS OH"}
{"text":"Yesterday was the 4th or 5th time being here and even though service has gotten better, the amount of food that is served on the plates have significantly decreased in size. A side of fries was a tiny plate of 10 thick cut steak fries for $3.50!  Turkey Melt was 1/3 the size from opening day. Maybe the bread changed but it was much smaller. They also had newer large flat dishes, but it makes all the food appear smaller. If this doesn't change, will not be going back. The bill was $48 for 2 beers, 1 malbec, 12 wings, 1 turkey melt and 1 side of fries. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Very nice outdoor patios ( they have two ). A lot of TVs. Nice beer selection ( 92 to be exact ). A very nice relaxing atmosphere. Menu has something for everyone. California Burger with avocado is very good."}
{"text":"I was in Indian Trail visiting a close family friend and his family. We came here for dinner because they said they had never been here before. I ordered the crab dip, which lacked any visible crab meat. It was unimpressive and disappointing. My friend's wife had the fish tacos, and she said the fish tasted old, like it had been frozen, and wasn't fresh. I had a Tavern Burger. It was ok. Underseasoned meat, patty was not moist, bready bun. Thankfully it wasn't an expensive burger, otherwise I would have been irritated over its \"meh\" quality. Where I live, a good burger can cost $13-$16 at a sit-down/waiter service restaurant. There was a manager who was yelling at an employee in the service area, out of view. That did not matter as everyone in the immediate area could hear the yelling. Talk about trashy--this is the main reason I am giving a 1 star rating. Otherwise, it would have been a 2.5."}
{"text":"Food:I order the Manhattan special chicken and rice.This dish was amazing!The chicken was cooked just right.Not too tough and not too chewy in texture.The yellow rice was soft and fluffy.The lettuce and tomato sidings added to the dish while the sauces topped it off.I also ordered a side salad which was very fresh and a great mixture of eggs,ham,bacon,cucumber,and tomatoes.(I think that was all the ingredients)  Setting:This location was very spacious.I did have a problem with one thing.There is a closed in patio section which I'm not sure if it is considered \"outside\"or not.The problem is individuals were smoking and the cigarette smoke lingered back in the restaurant to the area that we were in.  Parking:The timing of your visit will determine if you get a parking spot directly outside or if you have to park in the deck (free)."}
{"text":"We have been several times and the food is always very good. Service struggles as they seem to hire very inexperienced personnel. They spend more time on their cell phones than with their guests. We really like the nachos, wings and several of the sandwiches. The shrimp and grits are very good as well."}
{"text":"What's happened to hickory tavern? Reduced menus, terrible food that's overpriced for the quality, bartenders that appear to not give a crap about any customers and a waitstaff that puts the wait in staff.  Does anyone recognize quality food and good service anymore? Disappointing from how good this chain used to be. Now it's on the must avoid list in search of better food and staff. Indian land resturant owners and managers, the small selection of restaurants in old fort Mill are much much better choices ...Too bad we can't support our local restaurants..."}
{"text":"I didn't want to have to post a bad review but I feel it is deserved in this case. I ate there with my husband and 12 year old son on Friday May 26th at around 6:30 pm. They brought my meal out about 10 minutes before my husband and sons meal which was fine with me but the manager came to the table and apologized and said he was removing the salad from the bill. It wasn't a big deal to me but I was glad he took it off because the chicken on my salad tasted rubbery. But I don't complain about things very often so whatever, I ate it anyway. My sons chicken tenders came out and he ate one and said they were the most disgusting things he has ever eaten. I ate one and they were very rubbery and soggy and just didn't taste right. I didn't complain because I was already getting my salad free and didn't want to seem like I was trying to get something for nothing. Well the next morning around 7:30 my son became very ill. I won't go into graphic detail but he obviously had food poisoning. What makes me sure of this is the fact that about an hour after him I became ill too in the same way. My husband had a burger that night and he was fine. I called the restaurant and spoke to Phillip just to make him aware of the situation. He said he was sorry and would talk to the cook on duty that night but offered no refund. We spent almost $50 even with the salad taken off the bill. We had plans to travel to visit family for Memorial Day but had to cancel due to being so sick. Just want to warn others that this place is not worth the money and to speak up if you think something is wrong. I wish I had but I was too concerned with being \"nice\"."}
{"text":"Food was really bad last night, Tues. 4-15-14   The Worst salmon sandwich ever!  2 of us had it and we both said it was the worst salmon we ever ate. No taste at all, seemed something was wrong with it or frozen for 10 yrs. I could not eat it all.   Mac and cheese,  yuk!  chicken fingers, yuk.  French fries not even good.  Five people and no one liked their food.  Small side salad came with a ton of bacon bits, eggs,etc. which was not wanted.  Someone had tuna and oysters, I could not even think about eating that."}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight with a friend. We both ordered bottled beers. My bottle came with a \"Best consumed before May 11, 2011\". My friend's beer had a due date of November 8. I returned my beer and ordered a draft. The waiter did discount my order, but I was really disappointed in their quality control. Not sure if this was an isolated incident, but the whole experience left a bad taste."}
{"text":"They switch over to the late night menu before 11.the waitress said there wasn't enough people to have the full menu.  I counted 31 people. Guess they need 50 before the manager decides to offer the regular menu.   Late night starts around 10ish!  .... ie 10 items mostly appetizers at 10:20pm. Slow service not much to choose from drab atmosphere.  Waitress was nice,  but don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I had never been to any of the Hickory Tavern locations but had heard good things.  Since I was entertaining an out of town guest I decided to try the Metropolitan location.  My first impression was under-whelming.  The decor, even for a sports bar was nothing special despite the high rent location.  The service was overly friendly.  The server sat at the table with us on several occassions which I find annoying especially when trying to enjoy the compnay of my guest, not the wait staff.  The food was also unremarkable.  I had the fish tacos which were acceptable but my guest had the blue cheese hamburger.  He remarked that the beef was over seasoned and over cooked.  The blue cheese was crumbled and concentrated in the middle of the burger.  You could visably see him choking it down.  Now the beer was cold and I always appreciate a good selection.  If I ever return, it will be for the beer not the food."}
{"text":"New Hickory Tavern going through grand opening pains. I expect the level of service and wait times to be much improved over the next several months. The waitstaff has been great and the manager even threw in free apps for when we waited a while for our food. Been here 3 times and continues to improve. The food is always good (above avg.) and enough TVs to give you neck cramps."}
{"text":"Since I live in South Charlotte (not because I want to)  I have had to come here for a drink or two every now and then.  The patio is pretty nice, and decent beer specials.  I have never eaten here, but did steal a bit of nachos from a friend I was with-pretty standard.  The music is horrible, but most sport bars have that trend.  When I don't want to make the trip down to the Philosopher's stone I am forced to come here.  I've seen worse, I've seen better...all around....meh and generic"}
{"text":"Average sports bar with really poor customer service. Front of the house is friendly but incompetent and kitchen pumps out average food. Went on a Friday night, 40 minute wait and at least ten tables open - either they have no clue how to manage the front of the house or the kitchen has no idea how to handle volume. Either way there are many more and better options nearby (Dilworths and Midwood for example)."}
{"text":"Local craft beer? Check. Daily food specials, including an oyster day? Check. Good bar food? Check. Lunch menu? Check. Dog friendly patio? Check.  Dozens of TVs and crazy large pulldown screen for football? CHECK.  This is one of my favorite Hickory Tavern locations. Its on my side of town, the food is always on point, and you can get good beer, fast. Is it pricier than my average neighborhood go-to? Yes. But! Don't fret, my pet - They have NC specials once a week, bringing your local favorites to $3.50 and I think there's a night or two where all drafts are cheaper. They have a TON of taps and a full bar, something for everyone and you can tell that the favorites stick around. I've been here a few times on oyster night - oysters on the half shell are .75 cents each and shrimp are .50 cents each - order any amount you like! They'll bring over all of the plates, little forks, crackers, hot sauce, etc.   One of the two patios has those roll up garage doors for the fall and spring - let's be honest, no one wants to roll those up in the summer. Darn NC blazing hot summers....   This is a huge place, you can usually find me in the bar area - I know, you're really surprised by this. They also have a more family friendly, sit down booth area. They buy the expensive sports package, so you can come here to watch football, or a UFC fight - they show just about every big sports event.  Hickory is a chain, but a good option when you're not looking to go too far out of the Sports Bar box."}
{"text":"Great food, we had a turkey wrap and the buffalo chicken tacos.  Tavern chips are awesome, would try them as an appetizer next time."}
{"text":"We have frequented many of the other locations and still do but this location just opened closer to our home. Have been here twice first time was not so good because it was too cold in the restaurant however the food and service were ok. Second round the food was hot and cooked to perfection. Service was great friendly prompt. Im sick of going to cruddy restaurants, thanks guys for another great meal."}
{"text":"So I come in with a good friend of mine for a lunch date. First off it took her about 7 minutes to come and even get our drink order. Overall horrible experience. Not knowing I'm in the service industry myself and I watched her be very attentive to her other tables. But the fact that I was a young African American man on a date with a lovely Caucasian woman she automatically assumed that I was going to give her a bad tip. So that made her give my lady and I bad service. So Anna w from here on out don't judge your tables by the color of the guest. Just an fyi I had 5000 cash in my pocket so you could have gotten yourself a better tip."}
{"text":"Where to begin! Ok the staff is amazing ... the hosts are awesome too. The seating selections is perfect! When I got my food it was piping hot and delicious. What a great chef and staff. The drinks are amazing too .. I have a martini, and other vodka drink, and a mojito. I will be back .. soon!"}
{"text":"Let me help those 3 yellow stars go even lower. The service from both the server ..Colleen and the manager .. a dark haired guy was crazy terrible lol. I asked for 2 waters when we sat down and didn't get those till I myself had to get up and go to the drink stand to get it myself. That's where all of the waitress talk or sit on their phones. Let me also note that the restaurant was not busy at all. I asked the waitress to see if the manager could put one out of the many TVs on the SEC network (graduated from an SEC college). Hah that did not happen AT ALL. So the food comes out .. oh my .. my boyfriends fries did not come out till he brought it to the managers attention. The manager was like oh ok here's your fries. Like ok .. no apology or anything. I will never go back to this establishment."}
{"text":"It's the local to the apartment complex so it's handy. Tons of TV food is average though"}
{"text":"Last evening Ma was in the mood for a burger so I thought we would try Hickory Tavern, and it was a good choice. The decor is a combination of a large, soothing tavern with tributes to rock icons, and a sports bar with multiple televisions playing various sporting events. Surprisingly, Ma ordered the Carolina Burger with fries. I didn't expect her to order it since she has usually shied away from chili. She loved it, and ate all of it! I had the Smokehouse Burger with tater tots, and it was delicious. The buns were great as they were flavorful and did not fall apart. We brought home a piece of White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake for Ma to have later in the evening, and she really enjoyed it. Benjamin was our server, and he was terrific! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I always hate to lower a rating  but I will when it is needed... the past few visits the service has totally gone downhill. We waited 45 minutes for a salad and a burger. They claimed they ran my salad to the wrong table, but never mentioned what happened to the burger. And yet they still managed to mess up my salad order. Keep in mind this was not during any lunch or dinner rush time, but an off time.   Hopefully the past few experiences doesn't become the norm here, as we do enjoy coming here (especially when we have to have a late dinner and are limited to options in the area)."}
{"text":"[Southern Accent]Feller Yelpers,  This place was conveniently located near our plant in the Charlotte Industrial Park area.  Well, not that close, about a few minutes down the road.  This seemed llike a new spot and myself and my colleagues decided to give it a go.  Upon entering I was immediately taken back by the genericism (new word?) presented in this establishment.  It was spacious and open, however it lacked a certain [/Southern Accent][French Accent] je ne sais quoi[/French Accent][Southern Accent].  The walls were empty when comparing it to the absurd amount of paraphernalia found on the most generic of decorated walls at Applebee's (blech!).  So it was neither too much nor too little, the decoration was just bland.  There were however an obscene amount of TVs in this place.  I counted around 25 big screen TVs.  I suppose the budget went all to the TVs instead of any other decorative item.  This place has a sign outside with a dress code.  It was very misleading since it lead me to believe that this would be more or less an upper scale tavern with a sports bar feel.  Boy was I wrong.  This place was trying too hard.  We were all treated extremely well by our server.  Had we decided to play our hypothetical game of drinking a shot for each time that our waitress said \"y'all\" we would have been obliterated by the time the appetizers came out.  If I had a dollar for each time someone said \"y'all\", I could have paid for my entire lunch.  I would go on, but these are getting old quick.  Anyway, onto the food.  I ordered a Smothered Chicken entree (see my photo) which came with veggies and a fruit salad.  The chicken was good, there was nothing special about it.  The vegetables were drowned in butter.  I guess everything is drowned in butter in these bars.  It kind of defeats the purpose of ordering veggies.  The fruit salad tasted bland.  Overall, a very bland meal and atmosphere.  I would reluctantly recommend Hickory Tavern as a quick lunch bite for work breaks.  Perhaps the bar area would be a good place to sit and chill during games.  Therefore, unless you enjoy generic sports bars/taverns with gratuitous amounts of \"y'all\" being thrown around, I suggest you pass this one over for another option.  Later y'all.[/Southern Accent]"}
{"text":"We had great burgers last night at this Hickory Tavern. The service was great. We had the pot licker mushroom appetizer. WOW  it and the sauce was great.  Brian came over and took time to thank us for coming in."}
{"text":"Had never been to a Hickory Tavern but heard good things about the chain and thought it would be a convenient location for our party of 9 on Mother's Day.  Couldn't have been more wrong.  The entire party arrived before noon and were quickly seated. Yea!  Restaurant wasn't anywhere close to being full.  A couple appetizers were ordered and a few drinks.  Our waitress was great.  Attentive, friendly, quick with suggestions....everything you want in a wait person.  As it turns out, she should have been in management and not who was on duty.  We ordered our entrees and after about 40 minutes, started asking our server when our food would be there.  She assured us she was pushing the kitchen but nope....no food.  Another 10 minutes of waiting and we notice that parties seated after us had not only gotten their apps, but also entrees.  Restaurant still was not full.  We asked our server to please get the manager for us to speak with.  I really was just wanting to get an idea of when we might have some food.  It was now 1pm and people were getting hangry.  Now I am SURE the server told the manager what was going on but the word \"Sorry\" never once escaped this woman's lips.  She walked up and asked how everything was.  When I asked her if there was an estimated time for our food to arrive she told us it would still be a few minutes.  I asked her specifically what \"A few minutes\" really meant as we had heard that already.  She told me she had 3 people in the kitchen and it would be a while.  Still no sorry.  I told her that I thought it was funny that the 3 people she had working were able to adequately prepare the food for all the tables around us, even the ones seated afterwards.  I suggested that perhaps her staff had lost our order and she was making an excuse and I would really like to know when we would have food.  Her response was to turn quickly and walk off muttering something about the kitchen.  Again....no sorry.  At no time did I raise my voice at her or speak to her in an unprofessional manner, but I'm guessing I hit a nerve.   At that point, we called the waitress over, told her we would pay for what we had received and leave.  We all agreed that we had not been given any idea of when food would be there and considering the attitude of management, I would prefer to not spend my money there.  After walking out, my friend realized he had left something on the table and walked back in to retrieve it.  As he approached the table, the manager and another young lady were cleaning it off.  They were quick to tell him that they hoped he wasn't coming in to take any food because they had to throw all of that away since we left.  Um...no.  What food?? We never got any of the Entrees.  He asked for the name of someone in charge and was declined.  Thankfully, the hostess was kind enough to provide the info requested.  I have worked in restaurants and I know that things happen.  The way to resolve those issues is NOT to be a complete rookie of a manager, get in a snit and storm off.  It is also not resolved by making smart comments and acting like a child.  I may try Hickory Tavern another time, but I can assure you it will not be at the location in Indian Land unless I can be assured that the manager is no longer working there or has been moved to another role that seems more fitting.  Thankfully, Mother's Day had a happy ending and we were able to get seated quickly at Red Bowl Bistro down the street and have a nice meal."}
{"text":"Delicious. Burgers.  Rebekah is right about the atmosphere, but William does make the point about the decor. However, I dunno what happened with William's experience but BOY, was it tasty!!! I went with family and ordered the Mushroom/Onion/Swiss burger, Hickory Honey burger, and Chicken quesadilla. All were fantastic and full of flavor! The burger (M.O.S.) was the winner with a full, robust, mini-cake sized beef patty and the most gooey Swiss that melts in your mouth. Yes sir, that is tasty. Oh, and the fries were a meal alone. They were thick, rustic cuts of potato the size of fingers(yes, fingers. I measured) with light seasoning. Again, yes sir! THAT'S TASTY!  Umm please note that my family members ordered the other stuff. I'm not a professional eater. But if I was, I would come here for training."}

We kind of freaked out our pedicab guy going farther than he expected  - Pretzel: just the frozen version that was not good"}
{"text":"Family friendly sports bar chain with better food than I expected.  Food: 3.5, Atmosphere: 4, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (Chicken and waffles: $12) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Make your own salad: fun with the ingredient list they had. For my 6 items I did charred corn, avocado, strawberry, almonds, cucumber, pepper jack, and shrimp with a side of sesame dressing. 4.5 stars - Queso: hard to find this outside of Texas and it was a decent rendition with the gooey cheese and peppers served with tortilla chips. 3.5 stars - Boneless strips: tender breaded chicken with options for flavor coatings. The hub's choice of a hot honey sauce that packed a nice heat and sweet balance. 4 stars - Good menu variety: salad, wings, seafood, burgers, etc. - Kids meals: comes with a little pack of Oreos my son loved - Outdoor patio seating: nice with the family  Lowlights: - My mother in law didn't care for her fancy speckled fruity margarita concoction--she found it oversalted  Solid lunch spot and we'll be back when we're in the area as it's nice to find places in the south with healthy options."}
{"text":"I go here a lot with my family to eat good food. The waitress was needing a little more training on how to wait on tables. We put our order in first thing when she said hello it still took a good while to get the food. When I asked her if she knew how long it would be her response was \"its working\" the proper way is to go find out then give me a time frame, since my 4 year old has an internal clock of about 30mins max attention span. She did check on us consistently which put her in the plus one category to even out the negative. Overall a good place to eat depending on what you order. My favorite is the buffalo wings charred with blue cheese."}
{"text":"This was probably our fourth time to dine at this location. We chose it because we had a giftcard to use for the meal. The food and service has really gone downhill from a year ago.   We dined at this location for lunch on 01/22/12 with a table of three adults and four children. After seating us drinks came pretty fast and the server took our order. It took more than 30 minutes to get the appetizer - which we told the server she could bring with the meal.   The appetizer of the crab dip was tasty but it was another 15 minute wait for two of the adults to get salads which they ordered as their side dishes for their meal. Finally after an hour we were served food - not fun when you are sitting with four hungry children.  I had the BYO salad with Seared Tuna. The salad was only ok, ingredients were not that fresh and the dressing was just bottled Kraft. The tuna was tasteless - don't waste your money adding it to the salad. The other adults had Shrimp Tacos and Colorado Chicken both had neutral feedback. The kids meals were all cold."}
{"text":"Decent bar food and brews.  Food is ok.  I would compare it to large chain restaurants."}
{"text":"LOUD!!!    Hickory Tavern was a favorite.  Great chicken wings for my husband, a wonderful Tavern salad for me, enough Tex Mex and variety for our friends.   So...the big downside is  they have  incorporated a vocalist into the bar area.   My group has been coming to Hickory Tavern once to twice a month since they opened.  We like to sit in the bar.  We enjoy the outside area as well.   Tonight the outside was full and the inside had few people in it...because they have added a vocalist with an amplifier.  It was 5:30, but we couldn't talk about our week or make plans for the week-end because we couldn't hear.   I asked the waitress if she could have the amp turned down.  Didn't happen.  The manager couldn't hear me when we were talking.  His suggestion was that we sit elsewhere.  My suggestion is that you lose the vocalist or turn down the amp.   Be back?   Not until we know we can talk.  My ears are still ringing.  It was that loud."}
{"text":"So I have lived next to Hickory Tavern for about 8 years. When I first started going there it was awesome. It felt like a local bar. All the bartenders new your name, had your drink ready for you, just a good place to go. After Dan the GM, left it started to go down hill a little. Slowly but surely it has gotten worse.  Way over priced, service is awful, and the food is just so so.  The staff make you feel like you are bothering them, if you ask for something.  Only real good thing about Hickory is the TVs. Lots of them. It's just too corporate for me now."}
{"text":"Hickory is an okay place to go.. its one of those I dont  feel like driving far but I want some bar food. We had the BBQ wings and a side of fries and they were good. The service is a little slow but overall everyone is friendly. They have a wide beer selection offered in different sizes. They have tons of tvs if you are going for the game."}
{"text":"So I am a frequent customer at different hickory taverns. I visited the one on providence road since I live near by to watch the Yankees vs Astros then after a NHL hockey game which I had watched there a week before. Brooke was very sweet, nice and attentive and was excellent. However the gentleman who was controlling the TVs was not. I asked towards the end of the Yankees game if they could put on the New Jersey Devils game since on the tv next to it was European soccer that nobody was as watching. We were told that they couldn't put the game on because playoff baseball and college football was on however once the Yankees were over they'd change the channel. Once the Yankees game ended I asked if they could put on the game and the guy was hesitant. He walked over and then came back saying that he couldn't put it on because they didn't have the NHL package... first of all don't lie to me. I understand people staying there for a while sometimes can hurt business and all that however had they put the game on we would have spent more money and even invited others to do watch the game. It really seemed like the guy just didn't want to put the game on because it wouldn't be appealing to others that were there. There are over 20 TVs and I can't have one at the bar to watch a hockey game? Also if you're not going to put on the game at least be honest with me... don't lie to my face and say you don't have something when I know for a fact that you do... needless to say I will never return to this location again."}
{"text":"If you're in a hurry, stay away.  This is not a good place for a fast lunch.  Ive given this location numerous chances.  It takes them over a hour to serve a salad(lettuce)On a plus side,  a great place for sports events and drinks."}
{"text":"This place has great food. I went there every Wednesday for months to enjoy the atmosphere of sitting outside on the patio, where I could watch a game on one of the TVs, slurp down the deliciously fresh oysters on the half-shell, sip on a refreshing 20 oz seasonal draft special, and pick an appetizing entré. However, over the last month, the service had steadily gotten worse. It came to a head on our last visit,  when we were seated on the patio, like normal. After 10 minutes, another table was seated. After another five minutes, another table was seated.  At this point, I asked the hostess for a server, and pointed out we'd not seen anyone for fifteen minutes.  After still no service, I went inside and asked the hostess to please send out the manager. The manager finally came out and was very apologetic. I was not really looking for a comp, but I don't know that I really felt they took me seriously. The manager brought out my oysters, and sent us a waitress, who was very nice and also apologetic. I overheard one of the staff say they were really busy inside, so the original outside server was pulled off service to concentrate on patrons inside. I haven't gone back since. I really miss the atmosphere - and the food - but I am not sure if I'll be returning. I don't deserve to be treated like second-rung business, just because it's busier inside. I'd just assume take my business where I am appreciated."}
{"text":"Try the flatbreads! They are awesome! Also, all new TVs were put in right before football season, so every game is on and in HD!"}
{"text":"Very good location, just not consistently. The BBQ Chicken Nachos are fantastic and plenty of beer to choose from. Service is hit or miss and there's often a wait for a table, no matter what time you arrive."}
{"text":"This place was alright, my buddy and I went looking for a good meal and a couple beers and found an ok meal w/ nothing special behind the bar. I don't think i'll be going back to any of the chains. Pricing was about in line w/ what we got quality wise."}
{"text":"If you have been to a Hickory Tavern then basically you know what you are getting at any location.  Management does a great job keeping things consistent from location to location.  One positive that I can say about this location, though, is service is a noticeable priority.  I have never had a bad server at this location which I can't always say about other locations.   Essentially this place is fancy bar food, a little pricier than avg. but food is always good.  Buffalo chicken tacos are my go to and are some of the best I've had.  Burgers are also good.  I could run through entire menu but its all pretty good.  During football season this is our family meet up viewing spot and between all of us I'm not sure we have ever had something we didn't like.  Also, my wife's family being from KC it is hard to always find Chiefs game on TV, but they always have the Sunday ticket and every game is on multiple TVs.  Its a great place to watch a game, they did come in 2nd place in a national contest for best sports bar in america, and on Sundays the crowd is huge and a very random variety of fans makes the atmosphere fun.  Moreover, fear not, there are not to many overly annoying redskins, steelers, or cowboy fans.  Some are always there but never as obnoxious as they are when in large numbers.   Usually have a decent drink special, I do wish there was a slightly bigger emphasis on local beers considering the Charlotte craft beer explosion taking place, but you can always find one or two. No real complaints, great place, great location.  If only it was a little closer I'd probably venture here more regularly as opposed to just Sundays."}
{"text":"Last night I went to Hickory Tavern with the rest of my family.  We decided to eat there because it was almost 10 pm and we knew Hickory Tavern would be open.  The last few times I have been here (also around 10 pm) the music has been SO LOUD.  We were in the dining area and we were yelling across the table to try to have a conversation during our meal.  We complained to two of the waitresses and soon after the speakers were turned off in the dining area, which was nice:)  By the next song, the music was back up again!  I understand that they have advertised live music but really?!  Don't you want your customers to get comfortable, have conversations with people at the table, and most importantly buy food and beer?!  And its not like these djs are packing the house when there is a sea of empty tables in the dining area on a Friday night.  I have eaten at Hickory Tavern many times before but I don't think can eat in there willingly after this.    Also, this may be TMI but I always get really gassy after eating at Hickory Tavern.  It's not natural.  Someone else also told me the same thing!  lol  The ONLY redeeming quality about Hickory Tavern is the sweet potato fries!  I love those!  The food is ok but I feel like the recipes could be improved a bit.  The food is just too heavy to enjoy on a late night (even the wraps and sandwiches)."}
{"text":"This Hickory tavern is similar to others food wise, the food is of good value. What stood out here when I took my family for dinner was the service. All the servers were nice and the manager did his table touch but our server Foster was awesome. He was super positive and up beat at all times and he took care of everything we needed in a very timely fashion. This was our first time at this location and we will definitely be coming back because of Foster."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern is a local chain with several locations in the area. All the locations have many TVs and a full bar. The food is very good. Their wings are top-notch and they have a grilled version where they are finished on the grill. Two complaints I have though is that they don't have an habenero or extra hot sauce. They also don't give you very many celery sticks with the wings. With that said they have a diverse menu and their food is really good for a sports bar. If you're in the mood for seafood they have \"bucket of boat trash\" and steamed oysters. They also have fish and fish tacos. On Thursdays the oysters are on special for one dollar each and it's also three dollar draft beer night. That's why Thursday is my go to Hickory Tavern day!"}
{"text":"I waited to review Hickory Tavern because I really wanted to love this place. I have now been 6 times and had only 1 positive experience. The service is terrible! We sat at the bar and a drink was spilled at a bar table behind us. It splattered all over my purse, phone and shirt. Not one employee made a move to clean up the mess or ask if I needed a towel. My husband alerted the hostess and 10 minutes later the spill was still there. My beer was empty for 10+ minutes our food had had not arrived after 20 minutes (raw oysters and wings). I hate to give negative reviews (this is my 2nd ever) but this place needs new management and staff! Sad because i tip 30-40%..."}
{"text":"Best place to watch the games in a Ballantyne. Great Food and drink specials. Big Bar area with first come first served seating. Friendly and cool staff."}
{"text":"I went to this location to eat one evening.  The waitress was great the food was okay.  I prefer the Arbors or Gastonia locations.  However, each is consistent in the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and i drove past on a Friday night and decided to stop in. So glad we did! Fun, casual atmosphere and a super friendly staff. The manager came and talked/checked in on us several times. We ordered the chicken and rice, which was very flavorful and an order of wings (which were pretty decent for people from Buffalo!) A solid experience...we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've had one of the best burgers that I remember in recent memory. I rarely eat red meat but we splurged and ate some. I had the BBQ bacon burger with cheddar. Delish! Our server was super nice and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly considering it was Memorial Day. Food was absolutely awesome. No complaints"}
{"text":"I have only been here once and can't even remember specifically without looking at a menu what I ordered. But, it was among the best hamburgers I have ever had in my life! I have been to a few sports bars for football games as such and the food is always what you would expect out of sports bar. And while I'm not sure if Hickory Tavern is considered a sports bar or not, the food is certainly above par for what you would expect out of similar places. I have no problems going back."}
{"text":"Always an awesome place to meet and hang out w/ friends for a good time.  The food is fantastic for what is really primarily a bar....go for the fish tacos!!"}
{"text":"First visit to the new Hickory Tavern since they moved to this location.  The atmosphere is much more hip as apposed to bar-fly-ish as it had been.  Very impressed with the ample menu and, of course the HUGE beer selection!"}
{"text":"I debated as to whether to give them two stars or 3.  When we came here the first time, the food was pretty good.  The new server who was our waitress was super sweet.  We came back a second time and our app was the oysters.  HUGE mistake.  They were nasty.  We spat them out.  The manager came by our table and asked if we enjoyed them.  We told him they were bad.  He spent his time explaining how they pick them carefully, blah blah blah.  They were bad and we knew they were bad.  My husband and I spent most of our lives within an hour of the ocean.  We've eaten a ton of oysters and these were bad.  The manager didn't offer anything in exchange for bad food and that was BAD. We would have left with better feelings if he had comped them, but he didn't.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Husband and I just moved to the area, staying with family and happened upon this place for lunch.  Yumm!  Had a great salad and burger, was impressed with skme gluten free options available.  Waitress was very friendly- overall great experience"}
{"text":"I just moved back to Charlotte several months ago and this Hickory Tavern in Metropolitan is fantastic! Food is always good, ,location is perfect (the views, right on the Greenway, ample parking and close to where I live), but there is one big reason I keep coming back! Ishmail, the bartender! Such a genuine, friendly guy! Always shakes your hand, always has a smile, so welcoming, remembers your drink.....So many establishments in Charlotte should get this guy to train your bartenders. Let's face it, everyone wants to be \"Norm on Cheers\" (where you come in and get a welcome, your drink waiting, etc.....) Ishmail makes that happen! There are a lot of restaurants/bars in uptown. I have the great luxury of choosing from so many close to my place, but I always choose the places based on 3 things: 1. Quality of food           2. How cold the Corona's are and  3. The bartender's friendliness, respect for the customer! Hickory-Metro AND thanks to Ishmail, \"hit a home run\" on all three! And to top it off, the Fall music they have on Thursday nights outside and even having one of the best local bands (\"Simplified\") on Thanksgiving Wednesday is \"icing on the cake\"!"}
{"text":"I think I've found my new favorite spot for wings! I ordered extra crispy wings and the waitress suggested I split my order to try two flavors - loved the sweet and spicy Asian flavor . Big drink menu, love the outdoor seating. If you're looking for a very casual spot for a drink and a quick bite to eat with friends or kids, this is it."}
{"text":"They had a pretty good selection of tap beers which is an automatic 4 stars.  The fact that they have pool and a plethora of TV's made it even better.  I'd visit again if ever in the area."}
{"text":"Service was really bad and food was not that good. Waitress took about 10 minutes to even come to our table to take our drink order. After bringing our drinks, she did not come back even once to check on us to see if food was okay or if we needed more drinks. Food was barely warm. I won't be going back for a long time."}
{"text":"So, I am on my way to the gym saw this place driving by.it's rainy Sunday almost four in the afternoon.so,I am like the gym is open 24/7 why rush? Go get some wings and oysters, flush it down with bloody Mary and then go on the treadmill.Make sense, right.I checked my swag and walked in. Warm welcome by summer-dress-tanned-hostess.many tvs, protectors, huge row tables and cool crowd. fresh oysters, and you must try charred wings.aamazying! Not very big draft selection but great atmosphere! It keeps raining, but I am going to the gym regardless!"}
{"text":"I live close to this location and have gone a few times and had an okay experience. I came today, New Years Day for a late lunch and had a pretty lackluster experience. A friend and I ordered drinks and apps and an entree to share. The first issue was that our appetizer came out probably 2 seconds before our entree. When our food came we ordered more drinks and then we watched them sit at the bar for probably 10-15 minutes while our waitress very slowly strolled by at least 3-4 times and slowly cleaned off some tables and ignored us. We had to eventually had to go up to the bar and ask for the drinks ourselves (after we had already finished all our food). This experience earned 1 star but I'm averaging to 3 as I've been here a handful of times before and it was not bad."}
{"text":"SLOW service, good food and great company. We stopped in here after a Marvin Ridge football game to grab a bite to eat. It was very slow for a Friday night, and we were seated right away.  It took a while to get service, and when we did we were met with a lovely server. Unfortunately, she was very slow the entire meal at getting back to us. We all finished our beers and waters, THEN had to flag her down to get more drinks. She was not very aware of us, and didn't seem to have more than 3-4 tables total.  The food was good, but they don't know much about gluten free foods. First, the server told us that the burgers had bread crumbs in them... REALLY? Then her manager told her that they were all meat and gluten free. I did risk it and eat a burger, which was quite tasty.  If you have good company, the time will pass fast, but boy do they need to train their servers at this location. Slowest service I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here on Monday night Place very noisy our waiter was ok but food was  not good at all My Hamburger was not seasoned at all  chips were soggy and my wife had a lobster roll that was very very salty and the pieces of lobster were too big for the roll And fruit salad not great"}
{"text":"Slowest service I've ever received. Sat down at 6pm, didn't have order taken for 15 minutes, got my salad 15 min later, it's now 6:55 and we still haven't received food. Was given a lame excuse when we sat down that several servers didn't show up. How is that our problem? We should have left right then and gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Our happy-hour stomping ground, this location has great service and drinks. Great spot to watch a game as well!"}
{"text":"food has been over cooked or undercooked last couple of times I've been there.   I've really tried to like this place but I think I've made my last visit."}
{"text":"Two of us went here on a Sunday evening, after the (main) football game ended. Even though much of the dining area cleared out, service was mediocre. Our table was dirty. The food was mediocre. The gumbo was barely lukewarm, very spicy, filled with tomatoes with one small piece of sausage and two pieces of chicken. I dared not ask the server to have it warmed; she had difficulty deciphering between sweet and unsweet tea. I ordered a side of brussel sprouts because the description sounded great. NOT good, hard/undercooked. My friend ordered the turkey club and enjoyed it. Overall a more negative than positive experience. We will not return. There are many other places to enjoy."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks.  I have dined at Hickory Tavern for years now.  I think I've been to just about every location in the charlotte area...they're all great!"}
{"text":"I love Hickory Tavern and this location does not disappoint.  I came here on a Tuesday after work because I was in the area and had a $10 off coupon to burn.  I've been wanting to try their lobster roll based on friends raving reviews. It did not disappoint and was a great value.  I will say that the parking situation at this restaurant can be a little tricky so allow time to find a spot. I was quickly seated in a large booth and my drink order was taken promptly.  I did end up ordering the lobster roll with chips with a side of ranch dressing.  It was great! I would eat it again.  The crab meat was all claw meat and boy there was plenty of it. It was served on a toasted butter roll on top of shredded lettuce. The home made chips were nice and crisp with a little bit of seasoning to jazz them up.  My meal was wonderful. The sandwich is more expensive than I'd like to pay for a sandwich but I have to remember that it's covered in a lobster.  Lobster isn't cheap so $17 for a lobster roll and sandwich isn't a bad deal in my opinion.  The food was great and so was the service. I will be returning to this location.  I also saw an add for a buy one burger get one free on Mondays after 4 pm that I want to check out. I'm all about shopping for good food at a steal."}
{"text":"Service is very slow and the manager does not appear to be too concerned with fixing mistakes. What a shame, it is in a great location and could be better with just a little more effort."}
{"text":"I came worth some friends, expecting mediocre American fare and my expectations were blown out of the water. The burgers were juicy and cookies perfectly; the staff was helpful without being overbearing; and the drinks were delicious and at times, inventive. I'm impressed and will be back. Next time, I'm bringing my dog up the greenway to eat on the patio. :D"}
{"text":"If I were able to give no stars, I would! We waited for our drinks  (beer and wine) for at least 15 minutes - after at least 5 minutes before a server came to the table. We ordered a relatively simple meal. AND, between sitting at the table, waiting for the server to take our order, and the food coming out  (which was incorrect) we are talking about 45 minutes.  Also note, we are talking about a limited number of customers and an over amount of server ratio. Disappointing and it will be a long time before we return.  YOU NEED TO GET IT TOGETHER."}
{"text":"Met some clients here for dinner after work. Got there a bit late, so the waitress was just bringing out everyone else's dinners. However, apparently they got all the custom made salad orders wrong. I learned quickly and ordered a signature salad: the fiesta salad.   The fiesta salad has BBQ chicken, corn, black beans, romaine, and mexi-ranch dressing. The flavors were all great, but the chopped chicken pieces were awkwardly large as a bite, and the chicken::BBQ ratio wasn't quite right. Smaller pieces please!  Also, the sound was a bit loud for cross-table conversation. This seems to be a trend in some of my recent reviews... maybe I'm just getting old :("}
{"text":"I have to say that the food is good and usually consistent... Service is good but last night, we had such a horrible experience with the ONLY bartender on duty... Dark brown hair pulled into a pony tail with a butterfly tattoo on her right forearm... My wife orders a drink which she's had before and it was so bad that I couldn't even drink it... She asked for a beer instead and the bartender made such a scene bitching us out while staring right at us... Our table was right along side the bar. You don't get that hot headed over a drink you clearly don't know how to make. Recently, you only get less than half full drinks... I only order beer on tap now. But she needs to be fired!!! Disgraceful low class trashy person..."}
{"text":"This is the \"McDonald's of pub food.\" Mediocre food Locations everywhere You regret you came here after eating Service is OK The smell is really bad - old beer & grease Lots of TV's so good for out of town sports  Try to avoid this place if you can You've been warned"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now.  Both times I received excellent service.  I feel like there cheeseburger was the best I have had out in a long while, and the smoother chicken was delicious.  I enjoyed their Brussels sprouts too.  I only downgrade them from a 5 to a 4 because of their French fries.  There were bland yet salty, cold and just not good.  Drinks were tasty and children's meals even came with a cookie."}
{"text":"This place is such a waste of money. Think Applebee's atmosphere, with food that has no flavor whatsoever. I mean none. It's like they went out of their way to make everything as bland as possible. I got the shrimp tacos.. with no flavor. My girlfriend got the chicken sandwich.. that tasted like it was made before seasoning was invented. You've been warned: over priced, under spiced, and the most forgettable meal of my life."}
{"text":"HUGE bar at an awesome location.  Go shopping and then pop in for lunch.  There is a nice patio area or huge restaurant to choose from.  They have a lot of regular beer - none of my favorites tho.  I have had great salads here - and service has always been excellent.  This will be a great place to watch the game in the fall - TVs are everywhere and it is a fun sporty atmosphere.  Really reasonable prices and drink specials.  This is a great addition to the Met!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Service was average. Food was terrible. Had a grilled chicken sandwich. The roll was soggy and my avocado was old and brown. The fries on the side were disgusting- cold and undercooked."}
{"text":"My dining mates and I decided for a late night \"something\" to eat after a show.  The restaurant was fairly busy for a Friday night. The host was friendly and seated us. We had very friendly attentive service. Our orders were : chicken wings, sauce on the side, fish tacos, hummus appetizer, coffee and sweet tea.  The coffee was very weakly brewed to our taste, the sweet tea also weak in flavor.    The hummus was  creamy and delicious, pita bread became stiff and hard after standing a bit, chicken wings very tasty , crispy but somewhat salty   for some of us, most likely from the rub , the fish tacos came out as shrimp tacos and was very delicious so my dining mate didn't complain. The side of picked onions that came with it very tasty as were the sweet potato fries. Tv's were on overhead but all in all nothing overly noisy. Comfortable clean atmosphere. We would come back again and try other choices from the menu"}
{"text":"Great place to take a group. Extremely accommodating. Good food, reasonable prices, cold beer and outstanding service, especially Amanda. It's my go to place when I'm in CLT for business. Thanks all."}
{"text":"Well this really saddens me to give Hickory Tav 2 stars. We have been long time fans of Hickory Tavern ever since discovering them in Asheville a few years ago. We even drive 30 min to the closest one to where we live (Carrboro,NC). We decided to hit this one tonight because we were in the area. We had a bad experience tonight. First of all they changed the fish tacos. HUGE MISTAKE!! This was our favorite and we ordered it every time. My side (grilled balsamic Brussel sprouts) came out stone cold. My husbands side (broccoli & cheese) came out at the end of the meal. My toddler had pizza and 2 sides. His pizza was like a frozen pizza that was cooked and his was cold. He also didn't receive his side (apple sauce) or drink. Very disappointed and sad that Hickory Tav is lowering its standards."}
{"text":"Hickory tavern is a larger chain kind of restaurant.  it is a good place to go and watch a game.  they run a variety of specials - tuesday crab legs !  their food is solid and the service is what you would expect.  I have been to this establishment for lunch, dinner and afternoon hanging out.  Good selection of beers and a good variety to the menu earn this place a solid spot on any go to list I have."}
{"text":"Great sports bar. Place is big, service was great and the pretzel app was good. Can't really give a 5 to a sports bar but this was close."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. My server was absolutely horrendous! She acted annoyed that we were sitting in her section. She barely came out to check on us & our drinks were never refilled. The food was ok and I know it gets busy but Jillian (I think her name was) had a terrible overall attitude. Really makes me not want to go back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see all the reviews mentioning slow/bad service. I've always had great service here, even when the place was fairly busy. I don't often go on NFL Sundays or for real big sporting events, so maybe that's the tough time.   Food is mostly good in my opinion. Nothing incredibly special, but I have always gotten what I expected! I will continue to visit fairly regularly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch here and had a pretty good meal.  We both chose the build your own salad.    Service.  Nothing special here.  They checked all of the boxes and did a good job.     Food.  He build your own salads were a nice option that I guess has been recently added (don't know as I haven't eaten at Hickory Tavern in a while.   The quality of the salad was pretty good.  You can add 6 toppings in the salad and then add the protein.  I chose the ahi Tuna to go with mine and it was pretty good.    It's a nice change and probably would repeat if I was in the area."}
{"text":"This Hickory Tavern is one of my go-to's when I don't know what I want to eat or I'm craving wings. Hot buffalo wings, charbroiled with extra celery - yes, please. Now that they've expanded their Charlotte draft selection, I can see going there a lot more often!  We always sit at the bar and the bartenders are friendly and attentive - even when they're slammed.  They have monthly drink specials, like $3 blue moons or $2.50 Charlotte drafts on Thursdays. Check them out!"}
{"text":"My favorite sit down restaurant I've came across in the area. Never have had bad food. Service is fair."}
{"text":"I expect to be underwhelmed at sports bars and chains and expect nothing more.  And indeed they fulfilled my expectations!  10 minutes for a server to come to my table and she wasn't the server assigned to my table.  10 more minutes the correct server comes over and I order everything - drinks, water and dinner as I now see that if I don't move this along I'm in for a very long night.  The cocktail I ordered was some makers mark combo with a cinnamon stick, with no cinnamon stick.  I asked for the garnish, nope it never, I repeat , never appeared. I ordered a dozen raw oysters and a bowl of the soup of the day.  Dinner finally arrived, but the soup was cold.  I did ask for it to be reheated and it returned exactly the same as the first. Cold.  At last the manager makes an appearance at my table and removed the soup from my bill, gee thanks for not charging me $8.00 for a bowl of cold soup.  Moving along, if mediocrity is your thing - go for it. They did have a lot of TV's"}
{"text":"I agree with David. Tons of TV with all the games on. Good bar food. Nice open atmosphere. A beer list that rivals that of any bar I have been to."}
{"text":"horrible service! don't go!  my 8 year old daughter and I walked in for dinner at 6pm. we were promptly told by a less than engaged host that nothing was available and go look in the bar. no, would you like to wait, no nothing... not the first time the ambivalent nature of service at this location has reared its ugly head, but it will be the last! at least for me! be warned... this chain is going to die if it continues to be managed like this."}
{"text":"The service is OUTSTANDING if you go ask for Lidia C.'s section. Food is good but took a bit to come but once it arrive I was pleasantly pleases with my Cedar Plank Salmon.  Delicious."}
{"text":"This place has its positives and its areas that could use improvement.   As far a positives: they have live music, billiard tables, $3 draft pints and tater tots. Who doesn't love a good tater? We also had great service.   Negatives: the burger didn't have much flavor."}
{"text":"Lots of televisions, plenty of seating, specials every night and the bar menu isn't bad. Can't beat $3.50 craft and imports on Tuesday nights."}
{"text":"So, I've been visiting Hickory since I moved to Charlotte, but I've only now decided to write a review.     Hickory is one of those places that has it all. It has seafood,  burgers, nachos, and YES! An awesome bar.     What makes this Hickory awesome is none of the above.   Yes, I love their bar. And yes, I even like their menu.  But what makes this place great is their bar team.  These guys rock.  Not only do all the bartenders know their selections like the back of their hands,  they seem to share info amongst themselves and know just what drink to offer when you need it.  I can't sing their praises enough and I enjoy having a drink,  watching TV, and munching on any number of awesome appetizers.   Now, as far as the restaurant section is concerned,  I'd advise to stay away. Nothing seems to run as smoothly as the bar area and the service is just ok.    Regardless, the kitchen staff rocks and everything I've ordered over the past 4-months had been nothing less than perfect.   Kudos to the bar area and kitchen"}
{"text":"Confession time: I haven't been back to Hickory Tavern since the Yelp event here. I hadn't planned it that way; I just don't come to this part of town that often.  Tonight before a dinner locally, this seemed like the perfect opportunity to pay a return visit. The thing I remembered most was the awesome and extensive beer list. Yes, the beer list is in fact two pages long! One third on tap, the other two thirds in bottle or can. Local brews have a strong representation here including, Birdsong, OMB, Triple C and Sugar Creek.   I can't resist Triple C 3C IPA - it's just one of the best out there. Just when I thought I had gone through the menu thoroughly, my buddy, John spotted Bengali Sixpoint IPA - how did I miss that???! (because the list is so damn big, that's why). Our bartender, who by the way had a terrific sense of humor and joked around with us, gave me a 4 oz sympathy sampler of the Bengali. Wow! Now that's cool and classy! Me likey!  If you're in the neighborhood and looking for a place for a brew, some wings, apps or a burger at a reasonable price (all while watching sports)- this place may just fit the bill! Indoor tailgating for grownups!!!"}
{"text":"Needs attention! They've recently lost some great bartenders. Went a week ago and ac was down  - very warm inside. Came back today - still no air! Needs a menu upgrade and corporate attention! I think because it's not a high volume store they think they can ignore it  - used to be a great spot close to home -looking for another"}
{"text":"It's a good place to watch a game specially if you live in the neighborhood like me. I can walk to this bar and not to worry abt DD.   Once you reach their front door, these sweet ladies will open up a door for you and if you happen to walk in weekend or during big game, two ladies will open up both doors for you. I enter the place and it's Hugh from inside. I get to pick if I want to seat on high tops or on comfy sofa tables. I usually pick a place near the big screen or LCD tv so I can watch the game and not the ladies like couple of friends.   They have good selection of beers and mix drinks. I usually go for draft, I wish they had pitcher price but than again it's better for my belly not to order a pitcher. I like their food but they only have two or three vegetarian items so I do get tired of eating same type of food every weekend.   I like their service, their servers are usually cute and they take good care of you. I think their manager is usually on the floor and always checking with their guest how their experience was at this place.   I guess I will be staying away from bars this season since Panthers has yet to win a game. I think it will be better for me cause that way I can go to gym more often."}
{"text":"The Fish Tacos are what brings me to Hickory Tavern for lunch. They are absolutely fantastic. However, the rest of the menu I haven't had much success. Nothing bad, just nothing that sticks out and says wow.   The desserts are MASSIVE, and I would recommend sharing if you get one. The oreo cheesecake and the tiramisu cheesecakes are especially good.  They do offer trivia on Wednesday nights where you can win gift certificates (and apply them to your bill that night).   Again, 3 stars for having some good food, but I don't yearn to go there every week."}
{"text":"Walking distance from my cousin's apartment and it has the college football games (plural) we want to watch? Duh, we're going there for lunch.  A cousin clan of 14, they let us move the high tables around so we can all sit with each other. There's nothing that necessarily stands out food-wise here. It's your average sports bar and grill: burgers, chips & queso, tacos, sandwiches, etc.  They do have local brews, which was cool for us out of towners to try. And when I say \"us,\" I really  mean my brother, boyfriend, and other cousins. Me? I don't drink beer. Pretty cool spot to watch a game... or attend trivia on Tuesday nights! I saw the ad by the bathroom and SO wished I was in town for that. Darn."}
{"text":"Not impressed !! We come here fairly often but usually the one in Indian Trail- after tonight we wish we hadn't stopped here! The service was slow (it was 10:00 not busy but not dead) our food took over 20 min and the app we ordered was over cooked and super greasy. The table was also very sticky!!! Yuck! They have redone their menus and taken half of what used the be on there. We probably won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Good food sometimes but my last visit they were off their game. The Lobster Roll did taste fresh. Over all decent food with room for improvement."}
{"text":"What? Last day of Tavern Chips? Corporate Decision?  BIG MISTAKE!  HUGE! UNBELIEVABLE!  Replacement is tater tots? Come on. Really? All Hickory Taverns are awesome!  We love the food. Everything is so good. Can't go wrong with anything you order and the beer selection is awesome."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but entirely overpriced.  The tavern caters to a high class older crowd, and it is sort of a family hangout during the day.  It is a nice place to take your kids to after a soccer game (if you have the dough).  At night it turns into a somewhat younger crowd, it is half and half between older drunks and a college people.  The place rocks some good classic rock, and one of my best friends works here, Alexis.  She is an awesome waitress/bartender and you should give her your money."}
{"text":"Typical bar food with a friendly staff!  There are plenty of tvs to keep the attention of nearly any sports fan. It does get loud from time to time so if conversation is a priority you may want to seek elsewhere."}
{"text":"My friends and I went in really late last night (Sunday) because it was the only place around that was open until 2:00 AM.  We ordered a few beers and some food off of their late night menu. We all quickly noticed their 75¢ wings, since they were such a good deal!! It took a little while for our food to come out, but that's to be expected at midnight on a Sunday. (Slow periods = less staff = longer wait times) The beers came out quickly and our server Nicole was great about checking in with us!  After Nicole came to check how we liked the food, a few of us ordered more food and beer. One of my friends ordered ONE chicken wing, because he wanted to try a specific flavor. She happily obliged. Later, she came out with a COMICALLY LARGE dinner plate with a single wing in the middle. She said that the kitchen definitely plated it that way on purpose to be funny. We got a huge kick out of it, saying that it looked like it an overpriced minimalistic meal at a fancy restaurant.  Great experience. Definitely going back. Thanks again, Nicole!!"}
{"text":"Pleasently surprised with this place since we didnt know it was chain until afterwards.   started offs- crab dip-3  potstickers-4 meal both had Seafood Bayou-blackened tilapia and shrimp over tavern rice with a cajun alfredo, tomatos and scallions.    For a side I had a salad which had all kinds of goodies in it!  Salad-5 entree-5.    Overall rating=4.  I would go back to this place anytime and overlook the fact that its a chain.  At least its a chain I don't have near me!   Dessert=beer"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a couple of years...but it was THE ONLY place open on the Fourth of July??? Totally empty at 9 PM at night when we got there.Normally the place is packed when I drive by. So the menu had changed but must say it is still consistently good. I had the Cheese steak sandwich. I know that it is a precooked meat product but it was juicy and had onions and cheese on a great bun! My husband had a Burger that was thick and fantastic. My sister had a Veggie Burger that actually was very good....and what can I say..their Sweet Potato fries are fantastic!   I was glad I stopped back in..."}
{"text":"I've never really walked away from this place thinking \"OMG, that was an awesome meal\".  But that's ok, it's not really built to suit like that.  What it does do really well is provide for some late night grub and some friendly staff.  Decor is your typical sports tavern style with memorabilia adorning the walls and TV's located everywhere.  My most recent visit was a late night one where I just wanted a good meal and not too much fuss.  The waitress we had was almost happy to see us and that in and of itself was pretty amazing because I know if I was working into the wee hours like that I'm not sure I would have had the same perkiness.  Oh well, she was happy to oblige with our orders and the chicken sandwich I ordered came out perfectly cooked and was devoured!"}
{"text":"Another Hickory Tavern location, this time at the MET.  As with all the Tavern locations the decor is much the same.  Full of TVs, nice sized bar with wood accents and mostly tables in lieu of booths.  For the record, I'll always prefer a booth!  The food seemed consistent with the other locations as well but the beer list is always the reason to come here.  Massive selection and always cold.    The service was nice and friendly, although the order kinda got screwed up because maybe there was more tableside chatter than actually paying attention to what was being ordered.  Nothing too serious though and nothing too drastic.  Downside to this site though is the parking situation.  I think they may have a valet otherwise you are going to probably have to park in the parking garage across the street.  Good luck with that."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with the family.  All in all things clicked along well but started off a bit rough.  Walking in at 7:00ish on a Friday night I knew we would have a wait so I was prepared.  They had run out of the little table indicator/beeper things so I was a little cautious and kept my eye on the host desk to make sure we weren't skipped over, etc.  About 20 minutes in I notice a four top that could easily be a five top just sitting there and it kind of got under my skin that we weren't being ushered over to that table but again, the place was slammed and I put my patience gene to work.  Once seating (about 40 min) everything wen't very well.  The wait staff was quick, and even knew to bring out our youngest one's food first! That's a bonus!  I had the black and blue chicken sandwich and it was great.  A side of sweet potatoe fries with drizzled honey mustard really set it off.    They have a pretty decent bottled beer selection and the drafts are decent too so I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've lived and dined in Charlotte for 16 months and this is the best restaurant for the quality and price! The spinach artichoke dip appetizer was perfect and not too wet.  The chips we're light and flavorful. I tried fish tacos for the first time ever and they we're really, really good. My wife ordered a Turkey sandwich and it was piled high with thinly sliced,  hot roasted Turkey breast.  We will definitely return here."}
{"text":"Nice bar, crappy bar food. Go to watch a game, not to take the family to dinner."}
{"text":"We had a party of 9. Food took a little longer to arrive than it should, the place was not very busy. Everyone thought the food was good. The buffalo chicken sandwich portion was a little small. The side salads here are very good always fresh, and include a delicious croissant. The shrimp taco I had was one of the best I have ever eaten. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good bar for food and drinks. We always stop by when we are in town for business. The potato chips are addicting and the sweet potato fries are my favorite. I don't know what they drizzle on top but it's like crack. Cravin some now!"}
{"text":"Since we don't really drink anymore we hardly go to Hickory Tavern , when I was still in the service industry we frequented it a lot...but when we do go (or did)  we always got 2 dozen oysters and large build your own salads and tipped well. Last time we went no one helped us and we sat at a bar table for over 20 minutes (it was dead) we walked out and went to City Tavern instead. Well the other night we wanted a big salad so I called it in and my husband went and picked them up..I wrote down everything we wanted on them in advance and called and the girl seemed to get the order just right ... No problem ... So my husband went to pick them up.  Well I guess he should have checked the bag (I thought you only had to do that at drive throughs) and if we were not so hungry and the weather not so bad I would have turned around and brought them back myself .. There was next to nothing in the box ... These things are huge when you eat there .. You could see the bottom of the box , half the stuff I asked for was not even in the salad it was a joke and I was pissed after spending close to $40 on 2 salads ... At least I got a \"fair \" portion of the lobster I paid for or I would have raised hell .. Get it together hickory tavern you should be embarrassed... I was pissed and your kitchen staff can't even handle a salad order, pretty sad... Pics included.. I added my own spring mix lettuce when I got home . Next time I will just ask for a box of chick peas since that's all I got ....  Oh there won't be a next time so no worries... That's what I get for expecting a little more than crappy bar food for $40"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Walked in, sat at the bar for maybe 6 mins or more. The dirty glasses was left on the bar it has not been wiped or clean from food being left in the counter. Remind you it is a slow night and the bartender has not approached us or greeted us yet. He walked passed us at 3 times and served someone else that walked in after us. Never seen such a lazy ass bar tender who the hell wants to sit at a unclear bar. We just left. Nothing like he other Hickory Taverns."}
{"text":"Brian at the bar is the best bartender in Charlotte! Ask him to fix a drink for you. Been to a million bars but Brian can definitely fix a real drink. This is our neighborhood bar so food and atmosphere is always great!"}
{"text":"This location is awesome! I also love the Steele creek location as well. Stay away from Northlake. Waitress was super nice and the food was hot and delicious"}
{"text":"We began my wife's birthday celebration here with a couple of drinks. What made it great was the bartender named Jordan. She should be recognized. She was nice, attentive, helpful respectful and engaging. What a sweet woman. My beer was great and she made my wife a couple of nice drinks. She is why we would go back"}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday to have a going away party for my friend and watch football of course!!  I loved how many tvs they had..  But only thing is my friend was Browns fan and the only 2 tvs his game was on were in the far corners that we couldn't really see from our table..  And they wouldn't switch any other TV so he could see it.  But besides that the place was pretty good..  Our waitress was awesome and very attentive to us.  We had reserved a table which was nice since we had about 10 people with us.   The tables are kind of really close to each other so on days that it is crowded like on Sundays,  it is really hard to get around without bumping into chairs or people.  They just need to spread the tables out a little bit.  They do have a really nice patio area with tvs outside which was really nice looking."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and have never had a issue with service. Great waiter. Amazing food. Great atmosphere for me and my 3 girls. They also love it here!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a BYOS plus chicken and total came to $12.35.  Was the sorriest salad ever!  Too much spinach and very little other.  I was suppose to have 6 ingredients besides the spinach but there wasn't.    My co-worker order a BYOS and got the wrong kind of lettuce requested and very few other ingredients.  Returned the salad to the manager and got a soppy reply.  customer service is what its all about so not only did you have a plate returned, you offered limited customer service and will have 0 return patronage.... Not smart...  Too many other restaurants in the Metropolitan to enjoy."}
{"text":"Love their ice cold beer and build your own salads!!  My husband always gets their wings and says they're wonderful .  Definitely Bar food but good bar food!"}
{"text":"My first experience at this location was not a good one. I ordered a vegetarian style quesadilla, and after a few bites, I bit into the worst thing a vegetarian could bite into-chicken. My stomach is still churning hours later. Needless to to say, I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I totally understand that its Saturday night and there is a lot of people coming to the restaurant, but with good management and staff, you should be able to manage crowds better. Lets start with the hostess, I absolutely think that young girls should not be hired for this position. We got to the restaurant with a party of 13 (6 adults, 7 kids, one of the adults is pregnant) and it already went down hill that they tell the pregnant woman that we can give you a wait time because of the large party. Are you serious??? Do you not understand that pregnant woman and kids should be taken with more considerations? So we ended up waiting for 40 minutes for our seats and at one point they told us to split the party up in to 3 different tables! WTF, we got kids ranging from 2-8 how can we split the party up in to 3??? Who is going to take care of the kids? At another point they let another party of 2 to sit in a big U shape booth. WTF!!! If you let us sit there and then wait for the next booth to finish, then you would have resolve the problem, we explain the situation to them and not only did they not apologize, they just said they have a plan and said that we had only waited 15 minutes. Are you like F#$%#$ing serious? You tell your customers that you haven't waited long enough for the seat yet??? Seriously, miss, what if one day you were pregnant and the hostess asks you to wait 40 minutes for a seat. These hostess so horrible, they don t smile, they have no manners and they always put up their piss off face and smirk at people like us. So we finally got seated and now we have to wait 40 minutes for the food. The food was good so that's how they got the 2 stars. Waitress forgot to ask if our food was ok, left off an appetizer order and was always gone, but thats not her fault, she had to wait many other tables, but that is a management problem with the short staff. So all in all, this was not a good experience for us. Really want to let all restaurant owners to read and start training the hostess if you decide to hire young highschool girls, because they are not experience and not friendly at all. I come here as a customer so I do not want to be faced with pissed off young girls who are inconsiderate and rude!"}
{"text":"I gotta say to the guy Richard S that he is way off base.  I actually sat in Brandy's section tonight by myself and could not been treated better.  I travel a lot and regularly sit by myself and have to say she offered excellent service that was timely and very friendly.  As far the place, the grilled wings are awesome!  Great job Brandy and Hickory Tavern!"}
{"text":"One of the slowest places ever! Waited 45 min for a table.  Once we were taken in there were tons of empty tables.  Another hour to get food. Took forever to get check... waitress came running to the front when she thought we walked out on her.   Music too loud to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Waitress was a total bitch......I know there's a law that your not suppose to keep serving someone who is intoxicated,....kept bringing drinks even after I told her myself multiple times to not bring it. Multiple times she even acknowledged me, yet still kept bringing drinks and I even said \"she can't have anymore\" \"stop bringing her drinks\". My waitress even went and got another waitress to bring more drinks. Never have I been so disrespected and upset.....she wasn't doing her job right. Yes I understand your get bad like shit but you don't need to be trying to raise the bill by ignoring the fact the person ordering more drinks is intoxicated. I hope ya read this shit! I was there yesterday! 11/30/14 11:00pm. Yes I walked out cause my request was ignored and ya wanted to make $$$...even after I repeatedly told your wait staff NO MORE DRINKS!"}
{"text":"I love the wings and appetizers here. The atmosphere is comfortable and nice. Very inviting for dinner and drinks. The service was excellent and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"Good food and an amazing selection of cocktails.  Bartenders are friendly :)"}
{"text":"It's a great place to grab a bite to eat and watch the game. Nice staff and great food variety"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with family and friends.  The place is nice, TVs all over plus the giant screen.  I had chicken wings and they were awesome.  Great selection of beer.  It does get packed.  We came on a Thursday night - football.  I will definitely come back here for several reasons but to me the most important thing is that the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Beer selections were not good by today's craft beer standards. Food was pretty good just okay. Music was very loud and suitable to one genre only. TVs we're good for watching sports. Service was very good."}
{"text":"We were looking for a casual bite where we could bring our senior dogs and have a libation as well. We were most excited to see Hickory Tavern in Ballantyne had two outdoor patios - one was empty, we assume that it was perhaps the non-smoking patio. Our waitress, Kelsi (sp?) was right on the ball and a lovely person. The food we ordered (one quesadilla appetizer & one smothered chicken) was quite delicious and the substantial leftovers were dinner the next evening. The manager came out to say hello as well as they prepared for a big \"game night\" crowd. A very nice quiet and casual dining experience (it would not have been that way inside which was hopping, music blasting).  We enjoyed our dining experience and will be back."}
{"text":"We have eaten here numerous times largely due to convenience and it has been eh every time. We took a chance and ordered filets a few weeks ago. My spouse took one bite and spit it out, I smelled it and it smelled rancid. Mgr tried to tell us it was just because it wasn't cooked enough. Nope....meat was spoiled.  Prob ok for beer and bar food but not much else."}
{"text":"So I've been here enough to be crowned \"The Duke\" on my handy dandy Yelp app.  I like it here because it's an affordable place for me to take my kids and get a decent meal.  Let's face it, it's not the Capital Grille and I know what I'm getting when I go.  Apparently they're doing well since I see they're now building a new location closer to my house.  I've figured out that I really like their burgers.  Hickory Honey Burger seems to be my favorite.  I like to order it with one of their awesome side salads (for an additional $2.50 upcharge) which is worth every penny IMO.  The only problem is that they absolutely, positively cannot manage their ticket times well enough that I can enjoy my salad.  It comes out and within 2 minutes I get my burger.  PEOPLE THIS ISN'T RIGHT!!!  Now I'm forced to rush through my salad, which I really enjoy, so I don't have a cold burger waiting for me on the backend.   I explained this to both waitresses who didn't seem to understand what I was talking about or why I was unhappy.  Perhaps it was my sarcastic tone, I don't know.  Last night she took my burger back and set it under the heatlamp until I was ready, now I have a crappy burger.    Next time I will bring a timeline on how shit should be served and hand it to the waitress so I don't walk out with a case of heartburn from rushing through my meal."}
{"text":"This location has been open for a few months now and I've been 2 or 3 times.  I've been to plenty of Hickory Taverns before and I think even won the esteemed \"Duke\" title of the Ballantyne location a few times.  Since this one is right down the road from me we went Saturday night with a party of 7.  Start off with the décor.  Nice.  Plenty of TV's and gives you a great vibe upon walking in.  Nice greeting station to welcome you which last night, was manned by 2 young gentlemen.  Party of 7 eh?  Do you want to sit at the bar?  No, I don't with 3 young kids.  Try again.  We watched these 2 clueless young men sit plenty of other people while we waited for what seemed like 4 hours, but was actually 1 hr 15 minutes.  Way too long.  I understand there's going to be a wait for a large party but these kids had no clue how to work the room and turn tables.  Oh, and since it was raining they weren't seating the outside patio area because it flooded.  Sounds like a redesign is in order because they lost about 15 tables due to poor design.  We finally sat down which was a good thing because I was about to ask for BBQ Sauce to apply to my shoe I was so hungry.  We started off with the pretzels from the street food menu and the stuffed potato appetizers.  Both were good.  I had one of the best burgers I've had in quite some time, so I definitely recommend a burger.  They cook them Medium Rare when asked which is an added bonus.  My wife had the shrimp tacos which were poorly prepared and tasteless.  Shrimp, iceburg lettuce and watery pico, in this day and age with all the other creative options I'm surprised.  Iceburg lettuce?  Who does that?  Anyway.  Since there are no options in Indian Land this location will stay in business.  They really need to work the kinks out to make it a great experience."}
{"text":"Another great night at Hickory in Ballantyne!!! I just love this place!!!! Recently moved here from south Florida and it wasn't hard finding \"the spot\"!!!  Great experience from the managers, to the food, the drinks and best of all the servers!!!! Love love love Justyne and had the pleasure of meeting Alison tonight!! They're both amazing!!!!!!!! I've been here every Friday since August of 2015!!! :)  Updated review above:  I usually update my reviews when I'm taking back a star but tonight is an exception.   I want to thank Justyne for taking such good care of us!!!! My friends and I are regulars and some of the servers have waited on us several times..no big deal.  Justyne served us a few weeks ago and she not only remembered us but remembered our beer!!! She's on point with customer service and we will request to sit at her section the next time we're there!!!!!   Original review is below:  We always have a great time here!!! Meet some friends for dinner and drinks!! Order the Chicken Colorado!! It was delicious - grilled chicken breast with a bit of bbq sauce, bacon and melted cheese.. I know it sounds busy but it's so good.  The whole table ordered the same dish. Lol Not to mention - I had my favorite beer in the world.  Red Oak Hummingbird!!!  Good times!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service!!! Can't ask for much more!'  It's a great place to go when you don't know what you're in the mood for.  Chicken wings are amazing and so is the Colorado Chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Great place with tons of choices and both a bar type area with high tops, great for watching games on the flat screen tvs as well as a more quiet area with tables for small to large groups. The make-your-own salad was fantastic - fresh ingredients and lots of options - as was the California chicken sandwich. But the best part about it was our server Alison. Super friendly and attentive. She gave great advice when we asked for suggestions too. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Monroe on business, and Hickory came highly recommended by my North Carolina colleagues, so I decided to try it out.  I've eaten here three times this week!  So far, everything I've tried has been great.  The lobster roll is possibly my favorite entree; it's superbly prepared.  I'm about to rave about something that most people won't care about, but let me just say I absolutely LOVED their \"build your own\" salad.  So many restaurants want to fancy up a salad with weird, unidentified green vegetation, nuts, fruits, etc.  Sometimes, you just want a normal, iceberg lettuce salad with some more down to earth ingredients.  Also, they'll toss the salad for you with the dressing, so you're not sitting there with a little container of dressing trying to stir it up with a fork without spilling lettuce everywhere.  That was great.  Our servers have been awesome.  The beer selection is respectable.    The drawbacks - the bathroom floor has standing \"water\" - at least I can be optimistic and hope that it's standing water.  I think we know that it's water mixed with a lot of something else.  I almost slipped and came really close to falling face down in a urinal - not cool.  They should really fix that."}
{"text":"The food has so much potential but my god the service was slow. Yes, we had a really large party but 1.5hrs for our food. The wait staff really tried to keep us appeased but the timing was poor. Some folks got their food 30-45mins before the majority. The food is fine but once you approach hangry, I'd eat a piece of cardboard. I think the price point for the food is higher than expected for this style of dining and cuisine.  All in all, food is fine. Has a lot of potential but they cannot handle large crowds ON A WEEKEND."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The food that I have had has been yummy and my waitress Ashley was the best- bartenders Brooke, Sarah and Brandon all superb  I am from MI and will come here while visiting my brother to watch football and hockey"}
{"text":"The waitress was very slow and not very attentive. We waited a long time for food and drinks. This is 2nd time we have been in this location, well the Hickory on Providence is the best one-we have great service and our drinks and food arrive in a timely manner. We also see management making stops at tables to chat with guests.I told the manager  at the Fort Mill Location about our service and she just looked at us and frowned?? Then walked away?? We must have had 4 different people bring our food and drinks?? Table maintenance was terrible."}
{"text":"Overpriced and low quality. If it wasn't for their location being convenient for many, the place would be empty. They call themselves a tavern, but hardly have any beer specials. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here quite a bit, usually just for drinks. In general, its over priced and i'm never a huge fan of the food. Last night we had awful service. There was 3 of us who went to the bar to have some drinks. When I was carded, the waitress stared at my I.D and back at me, as if i was giving her a fake. After, she took my boyfriends card, and said she wasn't going to accept it because his picture had slightly started to fade over the last couple years of having it. He then presented his military ID and said for her to use this one. In this instance, she started becoming extremely rude. She started saying \"what is this going to be an issue, are we going to have problems here\", and was rolling her eyes. After she verified the ID she served him one drink and never asked if he wanted a refill, she only asked me. All the meanwhile, she never carded our other friend who was at the bar with us. We then asked to speak to a manager, not to get the waitress in trouble for doing her job, but to let her know that she can do her job in a polite manner. The issue issue was brushed off by the manager as well. There is a fine line between sticking to the rules, and then just wanting to be rude about it. If she was that concerned about his ID being slightly worn, then she should have upheld the other bar rules about carding the other guy we were with as well. Usually we have extremely nice waiters/bartenders, but last night proved otherwise."}
{"text":"Sure, this is a bar with bar food, but its not that bad. I love the BYOS. Its always loaded with the cheese and fruit and chicken that I like in my salad. And they have the best sweet potato fries! There's some great mixed drink options as well."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Traveling from out of town, and took a chance on this place.  The food was mostly bar food, but very good.  I had fish tacos, my husband had wings and the kids had burgers.  We were all very pleased with our food.  Our waitress was super nice and very attentive.  We loved the atmosphere.  I bet there were 25 TV's including several huge TV's.  The kids loved that there was a skee ball machine and a basketball machine.  The basketball got stuck and the manager came over, climbed on the machine to get the ball, and then gave the kids money to play another round.  They thought that was awesome!  Overall very pleased with our experience."}

{"text":"Not much to say. Went for dinner here since Buffalo Wild Wings had a long wait and we didn't have enough time.   Since my boyfriend had work we didn't order adult beverages just a water with lemon and Pepsi/Coke. The drinks come out, surprise no lemon. (We stated lemon with the water, so it wasn't like an un-spoken request) whatever, we decided it wasn't worth a fight and went to ordering our dinner. I had a Tavern Burger, he had a Reuben. I also ordered a side salad to eat prior to my burger coming out. Once we placed our order, we did not see our waitress ONCE until after the food came out. I had been almost empty on my beverage for awhile at that point, and luckily with the food she ran and got me a refill. My salad didn't come out prior instead it came with, and was TERRIBLE. The croutons were stale, and the salad was soggy (like it had sat out in the dressing for way to long). My burger was fine, I feel as though it was small for $10, but whatever. My fries were cold. The Reuben made my boyfriend sick but he said the flavor was good, his fries also cold.   We never saw our server again, until she dropped off the bill. So instead of complaining we paid and left and I don't plan on returning to this location. I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone, and don't see how people are raving about it."}
{"text":"WHAT?  I'M THE FIRST TO REVIEW THIS PLACE?!?!?!?  Come on?!?!  First, this place is packed during football, but they also have a Trival night on wed night @ 8pm which also packs them in.  The place is big...the staff helpful...friendly????? Sometimes.  The bar is long and they do beer specials...even imports.  The food is okay, but nothing here has really hit me as a favorite.  Big patio for warmer weather and plenty of parking.  When in the Birk/Cornburbs you should check this place out."}
{"text":"I needed to grab a drink and I loves the drink specials. $3 drafts on a Friday night. I would definitely come back with more people. There are tons of TVs and the outside seating is comfortable. I also tried their mozzarella sticks and they were great. The server was very knowledgable and helpful. It close to my apartment and I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing GRILL chicken wings. Over price but good cold beer. Awesome place to watch sports."}
{"text":"Great place to watch any sporting event . The have almost every fight. We came in for a UFC fight Jones vs Texteria. We had a great table not that there is a bad table with as many tvs as they have . The service was good and they had good drink specials.  Tough to find places airing pay per view that do not find a cover. So while this isn't close to home we will definitely be back for a fight."}
{"text":"My friend and I actually decided on Hickory Tavern for the All You Can Eat Crablegs, but opted for entrees once we arrived due to the variety of menu options. The crab dip was hot, full of crab meat, and creamy. I ordered salmon, sweet potato fries (my absolute favorite),  and asparagus. OooMmmG the salmon is delicious! The fries are crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle, and topped with honey. The portions are generous as both my friend and I had leftovers. I will be back for the $.65 wings!! Our server was very helpful as well."}
{"text":"I was at the bar and one of the patrons started vaping at the bar. When we asked the bar tender about it the bar tender said it was OK. It's the same thing!!! I don't want to smell your liquid nicotine!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 7 for lunch on a Sunday recently. I spoke with Daniel, the manager, as soon as we walked in. I let him know that my elderly father didnt last long at outings and that quick, attentive service would be greatly appreciated. He had a couple of tables put together and seated us promptly. Our server was polite, friendly and attentive. The food was delivered quickly and all orders were perfect. Seeing as how our country club completely botched my mom's surprise party 2 days before our Hickory Tavern visit, we were delighted by this group lunch. We look forward to returning soon. Thank you HT staff!"}
{"text":"It pains me to give this restaurant such a low rating. Almost 5 years ago, Hickory Tavern catered my wedding and it was amazing!!!! I would recommend their catering to anyone for any event!!! Better than most \"fancy\" caterers that would have easily cost us double the money. But alas, onto this location. The last two times we have been here, the place has been very quiet and the service and food still so slow. I often find that their food is good, but overpriced. It's truly nothing special, and it pains me to pay almost $7 for a small side salad. Yes it comes with a lot of toppings, but they should have an option like most restaurants do to add a simple salad in te $2-$3 range.   I truly want this restaurant to do well simply on nostalgia alone, but with so many more dining choices coming to the area in the next year...I'm afraid people will easily take their business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service was great the bbq chicken nachos off the hook...awesome IPA selection on draft. Plus lots of tvs and kick ass tunes played overhead!"}
{"text":"Update..tried again for quick dinner. Hostess, again does not kbow what to do or how to properly seat guests. 45 min. to get wings and a chicken sandwich in a virtually empty resturant at 6 o'clock.   Chicken sandwich had a good flavor but was cut incorrectly. Rubbery, tough. Tater tots were cold.   Moving on..."}
{"text":"Just ok, very typical sports bar. The food is good and the service is decent. They have a large variety of beer and liquor which is always good. No much to say about this place. Its typical. I did love their tavern chips and cucumber wasabi."}
{"text":"So - I'm not sure what happened over the past year.  The menu has changed for one.  My buffalo chicken sandwich was just a breaded fried patty with hot sauce drizzled like ketchup might be on a burger, but it was cooked properly and a decent piece of meat.  Fries were serviceable.  Kids' burger was fine.  But the big surprise was that my fish taco-crazy wife loved her fish tacos.  \"So you're saying I got a chance...\""}
{"text":"Smoking is allowed on the outer patio while the non-smokers are trying to enjoy their dinner.  The drinks are horrible."}
{"text":"Typically a good crowd here especially if there are any games going on. Had their burgers, french dip, Colorado chicken, wings, and chips before. All pretty standard, but hit the spot and taste good. They have rotating specials each day of the week (wings, shrimp, oysters, etc.). Shout out to our waitress and the manager from a couple nights ago. I made a mistake when ordering and received something that I couldn't eat. No big deal to me as I was already full from everything else we had ordered and I was just going to let it pass. The manager insisted that they replace it with something else and ended up sending me with another entire meal. It wasn't something I asked for or expected, but they made a lasting impression with this high level of service."}
{"text":"Great service every time we go. We love the pretzels they have with the beer cheese , and the honey bee sting tenders ! Great lunch menu."}
{"text":"Headed her to watch the Panthers go 14 & 0 (which they did).  Lively atmosphere and some pretty good food options.  The service was adequate as well.  If you go on a game night though, be expected to give your phone number and they will text you when your table is ready.  There is also an app you can download to tell you where you are in line.  Comfy place--I like it."}
{"text":"Game day?  Go here.  Especially when football season rolls back around (GO PANTHERS!).  The atmosphere is electric and that just adds to the fun--commonplace bar food is what they offer, but it's not bad."}
{"text":"We love this place!! Never have had a bad experience (and we are there at least 2x a month) Wings are delicious!  Atmosphere is your normal \"bar/restaurant\"  They have a small arcade area (small!) It is always very clean and servers are always put together!"}
{"text":"Food was fine. Service meh. Waited too long for the waitress to pick up my card. And they charge for extra pita bread... Really? That pita bread really was going to set you back? Maybe you should give more pita bread with the appetizer to begin with. Also let me know that it is going to be an extra charge so I can say no."}
{"text":"I really like the food at Hickory Tavern, but the service at this one was horrible. Our waitress was extremely rude. She took our order and we never saw her again until the time came to pay. She never asked us if we wanted drink refills and she seemed mentally checked out. After she gave us the check, she disappeared again. After waiting ten minutes for her to return, we finally had enough and found another waitress to run our card. I don't know what happened tonight, but it was the worst service I have ever experienced. There is another Hickory Tavern a few miles up the road. If you really want to eat at one go there and avoid this one if you can."}
{"text":"The Taven Burger with bacon was done nicely. Good char and flavor. @ $11 The wings are what we came for.... we wanted grill wings and there's an upcharge for such a pleasure. Geeessshh.  50 cents more for 6 wings.  $1 more for 12 wings.  The grilled wings are good and I can't say they are worth the up charge but until I find another place in town that will actually grill them then looks like we're stuck.   Got acquainted with the place due to a Yelp event. But forgot they are right at Midtown so that'll be our go to location.   They offered daily specials even a Pimento sandwich and chips deal for $3 during the Masters. I'm not into mayo based cheese but I will say I love that everyone around here knows it it a big deal and offers it."}
{"text":"So a friend and I went to enjoy a nice girls night out. We walk I and there are 4 hostesses standing and gossiping. They proceeded to look at us and then continue to talk. It wasn't until the manager was doing there rounds and noticed we hadn't been helped.  This isn't the only time this has happened. Very rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Monday night is buy one get one burger night! Can't go wrong with that. Burgers are great.. tots meh. Typical bar food with an okay draft list.   If your looking to watch the game it's a decent place, fried food & burgers/sandwiches is the go to here."}
{"text":"Typical bar food, service isn't great. Sat at the bar ordered Nachos for an appetizer with Chicken added as an upcharge. Asked the bartender where the chicken was he kept saying it's hiding underneath the chips dug deeper and no chicken. Half way through with my bland nachos got a side of plain chicken in a bowl. No apologizes or credits... Will probably only be back for drinks as the food and service are less than mediocre.  Will be looking for another sports bar"}
{"text":"Went here last night with the fam after a movie. I ordered the shrimp Po Boy. It was pretty good. The shrimp were cooked just right and had nice flavor. There were about 8 medium size shrimp on the sandwich. All in all the food was good. The service however....not so good. We waited about 20 minutes for a table. Not bad if it weren't for the fact the place was practically empty! While waiting about 5 parties all got up and left and we were still left waiting for a table. Finally, we were seated. But get this: a party came in after us and was seated immediately! No rhythm or rhyme to the madness! Then, I ended up paying $25 for two regular size (1 shot) absolute and Red Bull! Unfortunately the place has really gone down since years past. After my visit last night, I can totally understand why."}
{"text":"Tonight was about the worst service I had tonight.  My friend and I stopped in for just a drink and nachos.  First it took awhile for us to even be acknowledged, and we sat ourselves in the bar.  We placed our orders of one drink and a small nachos without chili and onions.  The nachos took forever to come out as I was half done with my drink when they arrived and I was nursing it.  When the nachos finally arrived they had chili and onions on them.  They offered to make new ones but we had waited so long for them we said we were fine and would just pick it off.  The manager came over and said they would make a new set for us.  The second batch came out much quicker, within 5 min.  Then it took forever to get our check.  When it came they rang us up for the full order and not the small.  At this point we were so irritated we just threw down some cash and left.  Definitely will not be stopping by this place again."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from work so a lot of my coworkers have deemed it the Friday Happy Hour location.  The service was alright, they always have 3 ESPN channels on, and their beer selection is mediocre.  Super uncool: my beer glass was incredibly not clean. How does a bartender not look at the glass before pouring a drink? It makes me cringe thinking about it.  I would set this place to a 3 stars, but the glass thing (a week later!) still makes me cringe."}
{"text":"Another crappy meal...stale pretzels, cold cheese dip and slow service.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this sports bar while watching the Tarheel game Saturday.  There are plenty of screens and plenty of seating.  Karoke shortly followed the games.  I hear there is jazz at some locations.  This place served its purpose.  I cannot complain about anything besides the slooooow service we received.  It took 25 mins for one app to come out.  The server was new and awkward as well."}
{"text":"Daniel was very pleasant and hospitable while being behind the bar!!! It was a pleasure seeing someone so devoted even though they were working on Christmas Eve. The food has always been a plus too!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful... Never get a to-go order here. Wouldn't take the coupon they mailed to us that didn't expire until December ( only reason we decided to go) and the food was cold , small portions & threw our nachos into a pizza box and must have forgot the toppings because our nacho order were all chips and a sliver of beef soaking through the box to our cars interior (why was this on the side of the pizza box n not on the chip at least??). In addition, their Caesar salad was soggy to top off their \"food  quality n business etiquette\"... Last statement so I don't drag on... AVOID THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"The staff here is excellent and very accommodating, very willing to help get the games you want to watch on the right tvs for you. Plus TONS of televisions!  The best part is they actually know how to make a property Bloody Mary, which very few places know or care how to do these days."}
{"text":"I have always gone to hickory tavern to get the lobster roll it has always been tasty. On last time in though they seem to have forgotten the roll part. It is now served on a piece of garlic toast I guess this saves them money but blows for the customer."}
{"text":"$3.00 Mimosas on Sundays..... Awesome!!! I ordered the Bee Sting wings. Which were amazing!!! The service was great. I will be back soon. Perfect spot to visit on Game Day!"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential, but over and over again lets me down.  The waitress was great, the manager was great, atmosphere was great, but the food is just not helping at all.  I had a smothered chicken with cheese, onions, and mushrooms.  Man that combo could be so good but it just didn't have any inspiration.  Tasted like it was cooked in a microwave.  All of the vegetables were under cooked and  unseasoned.  Nothing had any flavor.  I'll say that it has to be the cooks or the cooking process because everything else works.  Damn owners need to bring it together because I'm giving up on this place and only because I can make much better food at home.  All of the stars are for the floor staff."}
{"text":"A small hiccup at the beginning of our visit was quickly forgotten by the great service we had after. The food was great, hot, tasted wonderful. We shared 2 dishes & we were completely stuffed when we left. We had fun playing the trivia team game.  They have games every Tuesday night starts BF around 7:30 & the top 3 winners get gift cards for the restaurant. 1st $25 #2 $15 $& #3 $10  This was a great experience & we will return."}
{"text":"Great place, big with a lot of TVs if you're going to watch a game. Good menu with interesting items to make your own salad, custom sauces for wings, choose your seasonings for a chicken breast sandwich, and not your regular side dishes (tater tots, seasoned broccoli). We ordered the Jamaican jerk chicken sandwich, tilapia tacos and a salad. Good food and attentive service. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Sat out on the patio, and it wasn't busy.  When we walked in the hostesses were all on their phones and acted like we were a nuisance for coming in. No smile, took us to our table, dropped menus off and left. It didn't get better from there.   Our waitress was short, took our drinks and left. When she finally came back I had to ask her for an appetizer, and same scenario when ordering food.   Other servers brought us our food, and they were friendly and what you would expect of waitresses.   When I left, I tweeted the restaurant and got a reply asking for me to email them with more info. I did, but never heard back."}
{"text":"We are here right now and will never be back. We always come here and usually enjoy everything but not tonight. The bartender would not serve my moms friend who is 30 because she thinks he is messed up. He is actually really shy and always talks different. Before we came here he had one margarita at Azteca across the street. This was really  prejudice because he is not drunk and I ordered a drink and wasn't even ID'ed and I'm only 21. We will never be coming here again. The bartender is rude and there is a reason this place has shitty reviews."}
{"text":"Servers always seem eager to get back to their friends sitting at some other table. Twice in a row with this same problem with servers acting like I'm disturbing hang out time so felt it was necessary to write review....(chip stale) Obviously not servers fault but, overall still an okay place to grab a beer."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the most I've been here is during this football season.  Gets pretty crowded for the games, but a good crowd. Lots of tvs and seating.  The bartenders are really cool and very good about keeping your glasses filled.  Jason (bartender) is a huge Steelers fan so he makes watching the games fun. I usually get the wings and they are great about cooking mine longer to get them extra crispy."}
{"text":"Was just ok but the service was fantastic (Angel) went out of her way to make our lunch great....the food and an average server gets 3 stars.....,the food and Angel get 4"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and it seems like a solid place when getting lunch.  This location is convenient to my office and we have lots of office get togethers here.  For big groups, they easily can move tables for lunch so we have been here a lot of times and not been disappointed.  They did change the menu recently, I've only had a chance to try a sandwich but it looks like they re-invented their salads.. maybe not for the better.  Most of the servers here are pretty competent and pretty good at keeping your glass refiled and getting your orders correct.   Have not gone here to watch a sporting event, but it looks to be equipped to handle it, no problem."}
{"text":"Super crowded, but a good place to watch football as they have a nice setup to watch all the games simultaneously along one wall atop the bar.  Even though it was super busy, the server was still able to keep track of me and let me order (even though I was late).  Props to good service.  Probably a good bet I will be back to watch some more football or any other sporting events."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Sunday Football games and the place did not disappoint!  It's a bit overwhelming having all the games on simultaneously and avid football fans hooting and hollering whenever their team does well.  Managed to snag a large table (there were 8 of us) and our server was awesome.  She did bring out the wrong food order, but I attribute it to the loudness of the room and how crazy busy they were.  I ended up taking the food \"for the team\" and it wasn't bad.  Actually I ordered chicken fingers (buffalo) but the mixed up order landed me with buffalo chicken tacos - which were good.  A bit healthier than I wanted to go that day, but I need all the help I can get.  This location has a great patio/outdoor space that looks out onto Sugar Creek and also the downtown skyline.  Probably the only negative I could slightly attribute to this place is the crazy parking deck it shares with the Midtown stores (Trader Joes, BestBuy, etc).  I think there must be a time warp where everyone starts making bad judgement calls once they drive into this parking structure."}
{"text":"Went here last night in recommendation from a friend and was thoroughly disappointed. I had the Baja fish tacos and it was hard to eat because they were soggy and fell apart trying to pick them up. Flavor was pretty bland as well. The worst part was that the service was non-existent. Waiter showed up, took our order, delivered the food and we never saw him again. Finally went to hostess and complained and they sent someone else out to serve us saying he was sick and was now in the back rolling silverware which is exactly what you want a sick person doing. I won't be back again"}
{"text":"I first came here last year to have lunch with a buddy of mine. I ordered the lobster roll and fries. It was tasty, but a little pricier than I expected.   I've since been back a few times for various Charlotte Bobcats events and to have drinks with my buddies. I like the bar atmosphere here and the food is pretty good. It does get crowded, but it's a fun place to catch a game or grab lunch or dinner. Since my first trip, I've been ordering cheesesteaks and fries. That's my go-to order there.   The service is good and the food is pretty good. It's not my first choice, even in Metro, but it's a nice change of pace and a fun casual spot to catch a game."}
{"text":"Me and my roommate go here a lot. The BBQ nachos are so good  we had some younger guy server and he sucked so bad we didn't even want to go back again. We ended up going back last night and had Amanda as our server and she is so amazing! We will deff keep coming back and we will be asking to sit with her. We were going to tell the manager about how great she was but I didn't see her when we were leaving so I hope she reads this. Thanks for being a great server Amanda"}
{"text":"Way over priced for the quality. The wait staff would rather chat amongst themselves than serve customers and when they do they are pretty rude about it.  The food took a while and was luke warm. The taste of the food wasn't great.  I will never come back for sure.  Usually I give places multiple chances but not this time. The manager did gear our concerns but really didn't have a fix for the problems.  There are much better places around"}
{"text":"My wife and I were meeting a friend's family for dinner to celebrate an occasion.  I ordered a half dozen steamed oysters and a half pound of steamed shrimp as my meal.  The shrimp came out way too early, long before any of the other orders.  The shrimp were grossly undercooked, and the shells were still quite attached to the meat.  As I attempted to peel the 2nd shrimp I got halfway and decided to leave it and ask for a re-order.  The shrimp I attempted to peel had lost its tail and was pretty mangled from my peel try.  When the plate came back, I noticed that it was the exact same order I sent back, mangled tailless shrimp included.  I then asked to speak to a mgr., who was apologetic and promised a new order that he would personally observe being prepared.  I explained to him that a properly cooked shrimp should slip easily from it's shell, which neither order so far had.  He profusely apologized and offered a 3rd order at no charge.  I also explained to him that a good chef should be aware of the 'doneness' of the foods he serves.  He said that they cook by use of timers, and he would review with his staff their procedures.  I replied that a real cook must often test dishes for degree of doneness  by testing; much like throwing a spaghetti noodle against a wall to see if it sticks.  When they arrived (by now I was neither hungry nor in the mood and everyone else had long since finished their meals) they were only slightly more done than the first 2 orders.  I pushed the plate away and we continued our conversations until we parted ways.  Never.  Again, Hickory Tavern.  Worst.  Shrimp.  EVER."}
{"text":"They have a nice covered patio that is comfortable on a sunny day.  Plenty of TV's inside and a large bar area.  Lots of space for small and large groups.  Management is good about handling any issues that arise.  Food is good.  Service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"I've been to the one out Harris and it was ok. Took my little girl to this one after a weekly trip to target. And it was during the busy lunch crowd, not too many choices on seating. But it was ok, the service was slow I don't think our waitress was interested in being a server that day....lol. But other than that it was good, I never vary from the create your own salad and that was great as always.  This one is close to target so I'm sure we will go more often than not."}
{"text":"Update: came here for lunch this time and was extremely disappointed in the food here. We split the BBQ nachos which were pretty much just BBQ sauce and sour cream over nachos. There was barely any chicken or cheese. I also got the chicken salad sandwich which had huge chinch of chicken and just not appetizing to me as I'm used to chicken salad being small or shredded chicken. I only ate half of it because I didn't even want the rest. My friend got the fish tacos which she was happy with. Our server was great though and very attentive. This place is still great for the view outside on a nice day and a beer but would recommend eating elsewhere.  Can't rate the food as I just came here for a beer but it seems like a pretty cool place. Phenomenal place to sit on the back patio on a beautiful 78 degree day like today. View of the city doesn't get much better. Food from other tables looked food, would def come again to try out. Very large beer list and laid back atmosphere. Waitress was very attentive even though we were only getting drinks."}
{"text":"Great sports bar with lots of TVs. The food is a bit inconsistent, but there are some really tasty dishes for a bar."}
{"text":"It is unfortunate that I even have to give this place 1 star because they deserve zero. Hands down worst service I have ever received. We had to not only get up and ask for a server, but we also had to get up and ask for the bill. We were never checked on, nor were there any apologies. I have been to other locations and they were outstanding, however this location changed my over all opinion on Hickory Tavern."}
{"text":"Nachos were stale, Chicken was lacking flavor, marinara sauce was lumpy and pastey, the mashed potatos were sour rag tasting and all the soda tasted flat. The waitress was a bit scattered brained. But I will give them that they tried to correct the issues with the food...I've been here before and the food usually isn't so bad. I wonder what happened..."}
{"text":"Late Tuesday night dinner.  Blackened fish sandwich was surprisingly huge!  Good flavor, same true for the charred, extra crispy wings w honey hot sauce. Fries were chunky and yet crisp. Friend got the Ruben, and really liked it. I believe this locations food is hit or miss. We went last week for a late Saturday night dinner. The mini filet steak and shrimp for 19.00 was a serious disappointment. Steak flavorless, over cooked (med rare) and the shrimp had no seasoning & a freezer flavor! Nasty  But always like their burgers."}
{"text":"Very nice place to have a few beers and bar food on the patio. The bar and wait staff are very friendly and accommodating. The setup is very open and never feels congested. Definitely one of the better HT properties in the area!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, but I didn't have the opportunity to enjoy it as a result of poor customer service. I was escorted to my table by the hostess, but no server attended to my table to for at least 10 minutes. Once she came, she was apologetic, but still didn't serve with much more attention following the delayed service. This is one of those times when the lack of customer service removes the desire to return to an establishment."}
{"text":"I have gone to the Hickory Tavern 3 times because I wanted to like it and the servers have always been very nice, but the food is just not very good. Whenever they made a mistake they always did what they could to fix it, but they keep making the same mistakes. Missing items, slow food, undercooked or overcooked. I really tried hard to like it here but won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing sports bar!  Wish we had a restaurant like this in my home town.   Place is very open with a great combination of large and small TVs everywhere.   They have a good option for sitting at high bar tables or sitting in booths and tables.   The menu had a huge selection of food.  Everything from create your own sales to wings and sandwiches.  I had the bacon cheeseburgers and it was great.   I will definitely be back when I am in town."}
{"text":"Big screens? Check. Novelty sports memorabilia on the walls? Check. Giant booths suitable for big crowds? Check. Ability to make a decent burger? .............   Hickory Tavern is one of those places that is all for show, with a no-go on good food. Ordered a Honey BBQ burger, and the waitress and the courtesy to ask me how I wanted it cooked. Apparently the chef didn't feel like obliging her, and sent me out a well-done burger instead.   Apparently a Honey BBQ burger is a regular burger, with a side of honey mustard and a side of bbq sauce. Looking at them, I was skeptical to mix them on my burger, so after experimenting on my plate I did discover that no, sweet and spicy honey mustard and smoky bbq sauce do not create a favorable taste once mixed together. En short, I could have just gotten a regular burger.  I was delighted that instead of just fries or chips, I could get a side of steamed vegetables. Unfortunately, they were soggy and completely tasteless except for a twist of pepper and a sad attempt at a garlic chunk at the bottom for flavoring.   The person I was with got the teriyaki chicken burger, and while the chicken was very moist and well cooked, this thing must have been marinating for a hell of a long time. The teriyaki flavor was almost overwhelming, and extremely salty.   Maybe their more expensive meals are made with more care. But if you advertise yourself as a sports tavern and you can't make a good burger, that is a complete out for me. There are plenty of local places where you can watch the game that are cozier, more personable, and know how to actually make a burger to a customer's specifications. For two people, I wouldn't waste your time on this place.   Er, the Woodchuck was good."}
{"text":"I really think it's time to write-off Hickory Tavern.  I used to love the Charlotte locations.  Nope. Not anymore.    My husband and I stopped by this location for a quick lunch.  Big mistake.  The service was amazing.  The food was awful.  I'm not really sure what they did to my husband's tater tots?  The manager thought they had been dropped in the fryer twice.  GROSS!  They were petrified, cold and dripping with grease.  It was the strangest thing I've seen off of a bar menu.  My sandwich was wrong.  Basically the poor woman that brought her A-game as a server kept apologizing for the kitchen.  I will not be returning to any Hickory Tavern.  It's too unpredictable.  I'm not a fan of playing Russian Roulette with food and service."}
{"text":"Regretfully one of the worst meals I've had to date. Our experience started off on a bad note, from which it never recovered, when the waitress brought us our first round of cocktails.... Two in our party ordered Moscow Mule's, but were served watered down ginger beer/vodka blends sans copper mug,  mint, and ice. The waitress seemed annoyed and let us know that, \"if we ordered another one after this, we can have it in a copper cup\".  My question is, if the drink sat long enough for all of the ice to melt; what would another 90 seconds to wash the mugs be? The waitress was unapologetic, but did note that we could order something else. I opted for a beer, which came out without issue (in a bottle).  My next major problem was with my entree. I ordered shrimp and grits, a southern classic, which I have ordered more than a half dozen times at this restaurant in the past. The shrimp came out without being deveined. This is 100% unacceptable at even the most mediocre of greasy-spoon type establishments, much less at a $16 price point at Hickory Tavern. Again, the waitress seemed barely bothered by the snafu, and we did not receive an apology or explanation by management. A gentleman came out after the meal was sent back, asking for an explanation. I showed him the picture and explained the shrimp was not deveined, which seemed to baffle him. I'm not sure if he was in disbelief or was not sure what I meant by \"the shrimp was not deveined\". Either way, he did not respond to my negative experience in any way other than making a face and walking away...   In short, please don't waste your time or hard earned money at this has-been chain that no longer emphasizes customer service or palatable food. This particular chain has gone downhill over the past year. I have never had an issue at another Hickory Tavern in the Charlotte metro area."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on Father's Day with a friend.  Our waitress was wonderful. Attentive at all the right times, very friendly but not overly gush-y, made great suggestions for modifications to my meal, and made sure my special requests were honored by the kitchen.  The food was great too. Cooked just right, nice portion sizes, not too much or too little of the extra touches.  Too bad we didn't have room for dessert.  Only my second visit to this location in my 10 years of living in the Charlotte area. Based on my most recent visit, I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern is becoming our go to bar and restaurant in the steele creek area. We have consistently experienced good service and delicious food each time we have visited.   I frequently have the steak when we come here. The steak is pretty good and always more than I can eat! The steaks come with a starter salad that is almost big enough to be a meal itself and loaded with ham, thick cut bacon, eggs and tomato. I also get the loaded bake potato to split with the boyfriend as my side. It is ginormous and they stuff it full of delicious unhealthy toppings.  Last night we went for the .75 oysters and .5 shrimp. The oysters were incredibly huge and decidedly fresh. The shrimp were a little over done but for 50 cents a good deal. On Thursdays they also have half priced bottles of wine which made the meal even better.   If you are in the area and looking for a clean and friendly bar or to grab a delicious meal let me know. I am always happy to come here."}
{"text":"This place used to be proud of the fact that alot of folks patrionized it for Sunday football. What has occurred is a flat out change in service vs clients, where in the book of restaurants does it say the server is right and not the customer. Waiting waiting waiting on a greet getting a menu, ordering your food having utensils and condiments are part of what \"customer service\" where does it say frustrate your clients and then expect a 30% tip... The Tavern used to have some pride in being a sports bar.. All sports bar know you will have some squatters. That's the norm on sunday, it doesn't say ignore your clients and stay in the back. Service is what it is, service... Every time I come here its gets worse.... The crowd size is smaller why bad service, over priced food ($12.99 8 wings and fries ... Not a good combination... Mind you I did speak to a manager.. Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Wait staff has always been great.  However, we've observed the menu changes over the years and portion tweaks as well.  Used to love the Shrimp & Grits..but then the grits increased and the shrimp got shrimpier (almost half the portion).  Also the Ahi Tuna which was my favorite also was significantly reduced in size but the price stayed the same.  Then we ordered the Onion Ring Tower tonight and almost burst out in laughter when it arrived.  We thought of the other Onion Ring Towers we've ordered for instance at Red Robin's and there is no comparison.  Literally less than half the serving size and $1.00 difference.  We returned it and expected a manager to come to the table to check on us....but never happened."}
{"text":"Had a great time, atmosphere was awesome. Our food was sooo delicious. Shot out to waiter Miracle and entire waitstaff  and manager Maggie."}
{"text":"Fun place located on the creek walk! I had the mushroom swiss burger, the sugar creek ale, a jalepenio pale ale (was awesome with the burger!), the home fries, and the brussel sprouts. The food was spot on! The brussel sprouts were the best I have ever had!  I totally recommend eating here at least once!"}
{"text":"The next stop on my reuben adventure around Charlotte brought me to Hickory Tavern, a local chain type place boasting a wide variety on the menu. I've had decent food at Hickory Tavern, and this stop was about the same.  The reuben was completely average from top to bottom. The corned beef was standard deli meat, the kraut came from a package, marbled rye was the bread of choice, and the cheese was mild yet plentiful. The biggest issue the sandwich had was how it was made (see picture if you can find it). The corned beef was on one side of the sandwich, and the kraut was on the other side. This made the sandwich a little sub-par from bite to bite, although I know that's likely not the case most of the time in there (just got stuck with a bad chef that night). The reuben was pretty much middle of the pack based on what I've had around Charlotte."}
{"text":"My first time here, because I'm from out of town. We went a little later in the night with family and I had fish tacos. They were very good and I loved the alcohol selection! My family and I had a fantastic time! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. No complaints about this restaurant. Environment is friendly and the food was prepared in a decent amount of time."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for an early dinner and drinks.  We were seated promptly and had excellent service right off the bat.  My friend and I both ordered wine (we wished we came on 1/2 off bottle night).  I made my own salad and my friend got the Brussels sprout and oysters (see pic).  Everything was really good and brought out fast.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Hickory Tavern to begin with..  Plans changed and we were asked to meet friends here. They had a good price that day representin' Sugar Creek Brewing for Four Bucks.  We took a while to decide if we were going to eat there or somewhere else, but the waitress still seemed to frequently disappear.  Once we ordered it took a bit of time for the food to come out. Luckily my friend noticed my nachos had been made but just sat under the heat lamp at the nacho bar next to the liquid bar. While I was in the restroom and the food was delivered, she tried a nacho and immediately sent them back since they had already lost their freshness! The manager apologized and the second nacho batch was fresh and crisp. Everyone else was pleased with their food choices.  The bathroom was clean and in good working order, but the dining room seemed very dirty. The seating in bar area just seemed crammed together and didn't give you much elbow room."}
{"text":"There are several Hickory Tavern locations in the Charlotte area, and this one is in the fast-growing Providence Road area.  This also means that it can be absolutely packed, and when there are a few college basketball games on, it's even more so.  This is because the Tavern is not only a restaurant, it is a sports bar.  That makes it a little difficult to classify, but I'll do my best.  First, you have a largish bar area.  This section alone is larger than many sports bars these days, and it looks even larger because it's open, rather than being cramped and confined.  While there did not seem to be any smokiness to the area, there could have been some.  It was definitely loud, as most any bar will be on this sort of night.  Next, you have a dining section, which wouldn't be much different than any other family-style dining area, except for the fact that it was right next to the bar.  So if you take the family, you'll want to be aware of this.  It's not exactly set up for a quiet night out, even on the calmest of times, and this certainly wasn't that.  The good news for older crowds (those without younger kids) is that if you're waiting for a table, you can wait in the bar section.  They also have these very long tables that run the length of the bar area, and you can even eat there if you don't mind the crowd.  We didn't really feel like waiting, and since the whole building had a sort of bar feel to it, felt like it really didn't matter.  In the end, it didn't.  The only problem with this was getting the attention of a waitress.  Once we did, service went along fairly well, though getting refills was a bit slow.  The food was good, and priced decently, but appetizers were expensive, as can be expected in most bars.  Wings especially were not cheap.  But it was all tasty.  I don't know that we'll be back, but it's certainly better than most bars, and definitely a leg up on most sports bars."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern is a bit of a staple around town, but I hadn't been to this location (despite being to the theater a few times), so we stopped in for a lunch. I don't know if it was the time we arrived, but they were not especially busy, unlike many of the times we had been at other Hickories. Taverns. Whatever.  Anyway, after being promptly seated, the service was friendly, as is the norm, and we received fairly prompt service, what with no one else being around. Nothing special on the food, but it was a solid way to go if you're in the area - since several other eating options involve larger chains, this might be a better choice if you're looking for something before/after your movie.   Strangely for being a newish location, it does seem a bit on the dated side, but it did not have much effect on the service."}
{"text":"The Hickory Tavern is a perfectly reasonable fast casual-type place, though since it has been growing for a while now, it is rapidly approaching a status of something more than just a neighborhood bar. It is certainly better than the fully generic Applebees, to be sure, but only just barely.  While the food isn't impressive enough to stand out or be memorable in any sort of way, the staff is definitely friendly, which is a good thing, because without them there wouldn't be much of a reason to return in any sort of a hurry.  Where the problem really lies is in the marketing, and this isn't entirely the fault of Hickory Tavern - they do advertise themselves as a sports bar. The problem is that they seem to try and pick up on the same fast casual crowd that you will find at an Applebees or somewhere. The issue with that is you end up not with a sports bar crowd, but with families toting youngsters in strollers to sports bars, and that is just strange."}
{"text":"Because we have liked the other Hickory Taverns we took my parents here one night to introduce them to their charred wings. We had never been to this location before, and sorry to say, we weren't impressed. The wings were just okay, didn't really taste anything great like the typical HT wings that we have had before. We also ordered the nachos deluxe and the chips were all soggy. Now I know very well that nachos DO get soggy from all the toppings, but these chips tasted like they were old and had been soggy even before being made into nachos. I also asked our server for some wet wipes and she didn't understand what I wanted. So I told her I wanted wipes to clean our hands and she brings out four wet washcloths for us to clean our hands. WHAT? How does a place that sells wings not carry wet wipes and doesn't have their staff even trained on the concept? It also took them forever to bring the checks and they weren't even busy, only 2 other tables were occupied. Never going back here."}
{"text":"Nice hangout place. We usually sit in the bar area. Tvs are everywhere. I love their chicken wings with hot sauce. Tavern salad is so good! Large portion and has everything you could want in a salad. Mexi ranch is spicy! Nachos are huge and filled with cheese and chili. Chili in a bowl is delicious. Shrimp tacos are awesome. Never had the shrimp and grits but heard they were awesome. Only downfall about this restaurant is the menu changes a lot."}
{"text":"We were seated outside and I am pretty sure we were either ignored or forgotten. After waiting for about 15 minutes, my daughter went inside to ask for a server and to her surprise, there were 3 people just standing by the hostess area. Finally a server came to take our orders but without a smile or apology. The food was average at best and we sat another 15 minutes waiting for our check. This time I went in to ask for the check and 2 people were just standing around. Again no apology for the lack of service. I will not be going back to this restaurant and I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Inattentive servers. Overpriced food for a sports bar ($13+ for chicken fingers and tots, really? Must be the area.). Loud as hell. No silverware after asking multiple times. Small plates. Tasty beverages, but only after 15 minutes. Long wait to sit down though multiple tables were available? Kudos on the chips. Won't be back. Better choices elsewhere and close-by."}
{"text":"Had great service here once. Been back four times since and it gets worse every time. First the simple chicken sandwich for lunch had to be sent back (simply inedible). I am currently here trying to order a goose n tonic and that wasnt done properly. It gets two stars simply because I enjoy their raw oysters. Anytime other than 5-10 on thursday avoid this place. Proces have actually fluctuated tonight. These servers show preferential treatment only to those geoups that they know. Do not try to get food in a group of less than 3-4"}
{"text":"It's nice because of the casual dining, lively bar atmosphere, and sports enthusiasm (#2 rated ESPN sports bar in North Carolina) makes it a nice place to visit no matter what the time of day. The food is OK (great Fiesta Salad, though)."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, since it is close to our church.  The service is consistently slow and slack.  Refills are slow and it seems to be an inconvenience for servers.  Food is sometimes ok, sometimes just cold.  You have other options, so take them.  If all you want is a beer to watch the game, then it might be ok."}
{"text":"Great Wings & Fresh Raw Oysters with a great view of Uptown & greenway. This Location has less amenities than it's Sibling locations. i.e.: sans pool table, less TV Screens & a surprisingly smaller Draft and Beer Selection. Good Service and ample outside seating will have me coming back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this location is your typical neighborhood grill and pub. There were various beer signs and televisions mounted on the wall with the games playing on them.  I was actually surprised about the menu, and not in a good way. There was some bar food but not as many items as you would think.  I had the tomato bisque soup that was featured as the soup of the day. While it was edible, I would not recommend it. My husband had the nachos which were normal nachos you would expect from a bar- nothing out of this world. The think that really irked me was that the wait staff and other patrons were using the smallest passageway between my chair and a wall to get past when if they had just walked around my table there was so much more room. Instead everyone kept bumping into my chair while I ate.  We fined here in a Sunday night, it was Easter and yet they had no specials advertised for the day, although maybe they had a brunch special I was unaware of.  Overall I have this establishment three stars because it was clean and okay but it wasn't anything I would write home about. I don't think I would come here again, although if someone invited me there to dine as part of a group, I wouldn't be opposed."}
{"text":"Nachos were 95% chips and 5% Chilli. 1beer cost as much nachos. Service was bad."}
{"text":"Its a chain restaurant.  Consistent with their other restuarants, this place offers a sports bar ambience. Family friendly and typical burger, chicken wing and 200+ beer selection.  The food came out right, nothing to be surprised , its standard bar type food. The beer was cold, the TV's are all  working.    I am glad to say that , when the food is not the focus, they did a good job with service. Our servers, 2 of them, was quick, friendly and happy.  We also tried their oysters here and its the standard gulf oysters."}
{"text":"Standard Hickory Tavern food.  The service here can be a hit or miss.  On the 'big' snowstorm of 2013, they were open late and we were able to get a quick dinner."}
{"text":"Been here now for at least 4-5 times and the 4 star rating sticks.  Adult beverage wise, this place has a ton of selection. You will not be dissapointed with here.    Food is typical pub grub and I think their wings( plain jane) and their tacos are above average. They do have oysters , fresh, large and from the gulf. It will not wow you, but that just cos they are Gulf oysters.  The best part oabout this place is their patio.  On a warm day, you can sit out here and enjoy a cigar and a beer."}
{"text":"I must admit that for awhile, I didn't see the appeal of Hickory Tavern.  Sure, it has TV but even disgusting Applebees has TV and the food was so-so for the price.  Then, things changed and the menu has improved and the prices have decreased so now I'm a fan.    Hickory Tavern is my kind of bar and grill.  If I want to grab a beer or more and watch the game, the bar is well lit, the music isn't too loud to talk, and the sports selection is plentiful.  The food is great, sized just right with something for everyone.  I typically go for their burgers which are delish."}
{"text":"I visited with 1 friend/coworker, a 3rd party coworker, and a friend from the area. We shared an order of dumplings which were tasty. My friend loved them, but I was disappointed because they were fried and I expected steamed which I like better.  We also shared an order of crab dip which was mediocre, and there wasn't enough pitas for the dip, which always seems to be the case.  We ordered Seafood Bayou - which was Blackened Tilapia & Shrimp over Tavern Rice with Cajun Alfredo, Tomatoes, Scallions & One Side.  My friend loved it, I just thought it was edible.  The fish didn't taste fresh, so I'm sure its just frozen, and the blackened seasoning tasted more like jerk to me. The rice tasted like one of those rice mixes you get at the grocery store.  The 3rd party got a quesadilla which was rare for her because all she eats is burgers and fries, she seemed to enjoy it.  I would try it again, but not for seafood, maybe for wings or one of the salads."}
{"text":"Normal sports bar. Nothing special about food. Experience a hair in my avocado on my salad"}
{"text":"Great sports bar in Ballantyne to watch all the of the Carolina Panthers games. The waitress are always friendly the menu is great with plenty of great choices to chose food. My favorite is the baked tilapia sandwich."}
{"text":"The overall experience was great. Went to eat and watch a basketball game as we were out of town.  The waitress did not rush us as we planned to be there awhile. Had the Shredheads appetizer from the food truck menu.  The only thing keeping this from a five star rating. The shredded potato overshadowed the limited bacon and cheese inside. Would most likely get another appetizer next time. The meals were great and a lot on tap to select from. Will definitely try the one closer to home."}
{"text":"This place is just consistently horrendous in quality , increased pricing , and time o service . Another 30 minutes for our food order on a to go order and the order was wrong . Only reason to go here is ...... No clue . Stay away unless you like bad food and slow service with high prices"}
{"text":"Extra friendly service by a well trained staff. This is a happening spot, especially if you have to bring the kiddos along. It's got a great vibe and I've always had a great experience every time I've been. In my opinion have the best shrimp and grits! I love the atmosphere,  the people, and the food!"}
{"text":"This place is good! It has good fresh seafood and high-quality food. The service is great and they turn out food quickly, even on a busy night. Overall, they do your standard American sports bar food very well, I will certainly be back,"}
{"text":"The waitress did an outstanding job. She was very attentive and helpful. Our oysters were nicely chilled and had a good saltiness. They tasted very fresh however, the shells could have been scrubbed a little better. I liked that they had a local beer selection. The jerk wings were flavorful but, they could have had a bit more kick. All of us enjoyed the food and we even took home some cheesecake which was awesome"}
{"text":"I'm not in love with Hickory Tavern, and honestly most times I'd probably pick somewhere else to go if I were just looking for a few drinks for the night.   However, I tried a build your own salad last time I was there, and HOLY GOD it was one of the BEST salads I've ever had. They filled that bowl up as high as they could and the apple cider vinegar tasted so good I think angels might have started singing... The place has been hopping every time I've been there though so I couldn't make out the trumpets from the heavens above quite distinctly.   They also give you a small honey buttered croissant with the salads and I swear to you, I'd drive an hour to go there just for that little morsel of deliciousness. OMG. YUM. Did they put magical food dust in this stuff or what???   They have a decent selection of food to choose from, and other things I'd tried were pretty good as well. But, nothing touches their salads. Now I'm craving one, and it's too late to go!!! Noooooooooooooooo!!!   Perhaps they'll see me this weekend... yes.. perhaps they will."}
{"text":"Really 12 dollars for a burger - this place raises its prices every week. Now they have removed Tuesday and Saturday pint night. What a monopoly - when competition comes they will loose a ton of business. Bad service and over priced bar food - don't waste your time."}
{"text":"We reserved the private room for an end of a basketball league team dinner way in advance. 35 of us. They gave us 1 waitress! After an hour and a half,  many of us still did not get our food. Many of us had our orders completely wrong, overlooked, cold etc....after 2 hours many of us still did not get our complete order......the manager stated we are getting the food out as quickly as we can and never showed his face to us again. They did nothing for us and simply did not care. Food and service the worst I have had in 35 years! Do NOT eat here!!!!!! Rudest management ever!!!!! If they could not accommodate a party this size, they should have told us this at the time of the reservation. Food was so cold and horrible after the wait. Would have given 0 stars if I could have!!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and it was great! For a sports bar the food is very good. We had a very good server and very good food. I really like the fish taco's and the tavern chips. The manager stopped by and chatted with us and she is very friendly. People need to remember they are in a sports bar that is always busy and not an up scale restaurant."}
{"text":"So....I have been to several of HT throughout the area but this particular location is closest to me but my least favorite. For the most part the food is on par with the other locations but we always have some issue at this location.  Four of us went this past Saturday night to watch come collage football. We expected it to be packed but it wasn't probably about 50% give or take a little throughout the night.  1) Both couples ordered oysters. Took a while for them to come out but we were not in a hurry so that isn't an issue however the issues were they were brought on undersized plates so they were falling off. Still no big deal. However, we did not get crackers, lemons, cocktail sauce, horseradish OR SHUCKERS. After about 10 minutes waitress comes by and we ask for these items and I order a beer. After about another 10 minutes the items show up but by then the oysters were cold but we were hungry so we ate them. Still no beer, ask again and it finally comes after about 20 minutes.  2) When the waitress cleans off the table from the appetizers she tries to carry to much a 3 plates shatter on the ground. No biggie, it happens.  3) Order our entrees, 2 of us got crab legs. Food arrives at different times. Salads after cooked items. Ehh, just happy to have our food. The crab legs were kinda salty but more importantly we each had several legs with no crab meat. Where did it go, IDK. Disappointed.  4) Advised the waitress we'd be there watching for a while to leave our tabs open. She says of course. Next thing we know she shows up with the bills. Which we sent back as we ordered another round.  I am pretty chill and have never given a bad review before but it seems to be something every time at this location. I once slipped on the bar floor due to water being puddled up which I didn't see. Mgmt at the time which is not the current mgmt was rude about it like it was my fault.  I wish my local HT would step it up."}
{"text":"Fantastic all you can eat shrimp. Great environment."}
{"text":"Pretty good sports bar. Their wings are great and the bartenders are good. They used to have a very small play area for kids with games and etc. I wish they still had it :("}
{"text":"Some of the worst food I've had at a restaurant.  Gordon Ramsey please visit this place!    Ordered a variety of food because we were fearful of the quality once we sat down and took a look at the place.  The chicken tacos make Taco Bell seem like authentic Mexican.  They are pretty much what they served in high school cafeterias.  The smothered chicken was a disaster.  It was supposed to be a chicken breast with onions, mushroom, etc with melted cheese, but what we got was an undercooked piece of chicken with veggies around it were ridiculously overcooked creating a pile of mush with cheese on top.  We also ordered the blackened tilapia.  Tilapia is a dirty fish already.  Now imagine it frozen and thawed, overcooked, and then someone dumps some McKormick blackening spice all over it.  One bite and I thought I was eating something that was received from the coals in the grill.  Awful.   Bottom line.....go here for a beer and to watch a game, but do yourself a favor and don't order ANY of the food.  It's all frozen and thawed tasteless crap."}
{"text":"Was in town on business. After some light shopping I decided to stop in for food and drink.  Place was pretty much empty and I was the only one at the bar at about 4:30.  Bartender was very nice.... but when I asked if it was Happy Hour.... he honestly said\" I really don't know.... let me check\". Left came back... said he still didn't know. I find that utterly weird! He made up for that with some menu selections and conversation on the local Baseball team.  I started with oysters. They were quite good and fresh. Of course I asked where they were from.... he had to ask.  His shift was over so he was nice enough to come over to say he was leaving.  I had no idea who was replacing him as I was never approached to say that they would take over.  When I finally saw a woman behind the bar.. I asked for a menu. She handed me the menu and never said a word.  Had to get her attention to order more food.  Keep in mind... there now was maybe 9 people at the bar.  I ordered more food. It was just okay.  I'll look for a different watering hole next time.  One that has Happy Hour and actually knows what it entails. Oh and as I was leaving. ...3 people at the \"hostess\" station. ( one very well dressed woman ). Assuming she was a manager. Not one goodbye or thank you for stopping in, they were too busy talking amongst themselves."}
{"text":"Know what you're expecting! The food is casual bar food and the drinks are good. Hickory Tavern is great if you're looking for your neighborhood American chain restaurant/bar in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"This place is really all about getting drunk and watching TV.  A decent place to meet friends for the game and have a few drinks after work.  The food is less than stellar....OK at best.  Nothing special...just bar food.  Place always smells like a urinal.....like cleaning solution mixed with ammonia.    Service is decent."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with my service here. Very rude waitress, came back only once to fill our drinks, didn't check up on my wife and I, and took 45 minutes for our food! It will definitely be a long time before I use this spot as a date night."}
{"text":"They grill their wings after the fryer and season their baked potatoes....little things go a long way, my food was better then expected for being at the local watering hole while away for work. Oh, and the bartender w sexy glasses is a good thing too."}
{"text":"Our experience tonight was well above expectation! Our server, Michael, was outstanding and even went the extra mile to shake our hands at the end of the meal, perfect touch! Our orders were made correctly, the atmosphere was perfect. I will definitely make this one of my more visited destinations in the area!"}
{"text":"So, I have been in Charlotte for 2 years now, I came from San Diego, Ca. Arguably best tacos in the U.S. can be found there.  Now I have been in search for good Mexican food/ tacos since I've moved here. These marinated steak tacos are not Mexican style but are the best tacos I've had since moving here.  If you are on the fence with anything about this place go with these and your mouth will fall in Love."}
{"text":"I always sit at the bar, service is Good and food is up to par bar fare. The clientale can get a bit rowdy during games. Patio is unbeatable for the view of the skyline and all the tvs. Ishmael is remarkably fast to be almost 50 years old."}
{"text":"First off, out server was attentive and friendly.  That's the end of the nice comments.  Ordered steamed oysters, they came out cold, not even sure how that's possible.  The oysters were covered in mud, not even rinsed off, which is very unappetizing.  My wife ordered a NY strip, it tasted pretty good but was undercooked.  She had a baked potato, it was not even warm enough to melt butter.  We ordered drinks, all of which came out with no garnish.  We were planning on sitting at the bar after dinner for a few drinks, but we decided on leaving to go to another bar."}
{"text":"Upbeat atmosphere and tasty food. Not conducive to intimate conversation though as the music is pretty loud. But as the establishment name suggests, it's more along the lines of a sports bar (but with table service)."}
{"text":"Great sports bar! It's very crowded on Sundays for football, but its worth it because they have some great drink specials and plenty of televisions to catch the all the games! The bartenders, management and waitstaff are very friendly! I highly recommend this place! By the way, the bee sting wings are amazing!"}
{"text":"So went there for dinner for work. Pleasantly surprised at the range of items. I ordered the tavern salad due to its close to California Dreaming salad with their dressing.  Dressing was a little thicker than I liked. Good items. I ordered the club and was amazing."}
{"text":"Hickory tavern in Steele Creek is one of our favorite places to eat and watch a game. We like to sit in the bar area and have always been able to find a seat even on busy nights. My husband likes the wide selection of craft beers and they have good bartenders for mixed drinks. The food is always good, my favorite is the wood fired salmon with broccoli. The Tavern chips are are my families favorite. The service is good & since we go in often they remember us. Lots of TVs with all the games/sporting events on. Great place!"}
{"text":"My significant other and I come here often and increasingly lately due to the amazing service we have been receiving from Emma. She is fun, cute, prompt, and easy to love! Emma is a great bartender and we love when she takes care of us!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting this location.  I went in for a 4:00 late lunch/early dinner meal.  Parking here is kind of a pain because drivers don't pay attention to pedestrians.  When I walk in the hostess opened the door to greet me then made casual conversation on the way to the table.  The hostess said they got a new menu about a month ago and my heart sunk, thinking they wouldn't have what I wanted.  (The website still has the old menu posted.). The hostess pointed out many new menu items, all of which sounded great!  I stuck to my favorite item to satisfy that craving I had been having, crab dip.  I also decided to get a fish sandwich.  The crab dip was excellent, as usual.  The fish sandwich was flaky and flavorful.  I tried to eat it sandwich-style, but it was too messy.  I think if the fish were available as fried, it would hold up better.  I ate the fish with a fork.  Service was great.  My server kept the water full and timed food arrival perfectly.  A manager stopped at my table to see how I was doing, and was also seen around the restaurant directing employees like a manager should."}
{"text":"The food and service here is mediocre.  I come here for lunch since I can be in and out quickly.  I love the crab dip especially!  The grilled pimento cheese sandwich is also delicious and has a little zing flavor to it.  Outside lunch, I've never had good service in the dining room.  I can't speak for the bar area since I don't drink often."}
{"text":"So... this review probably should have been written 3 months ago - the last time I went.  Came here for an event thrown by my friend's apt complex - Hickory had free food and a couple of free drinks.  The first thing you notice about stepping into this place is how clean it is and how many TV screens that they have everywhere.  Maybe it's because it's located in the Met, but tidiness is often overlooked. Everything was shiny - something Mr. Clean could appreciate.  And there was numerous TVs everywhere.  When I came back in January, you could pretty much find any game on TV.  It was a little loud in there which made it difficult to chat at times, but this was/felt like/is a sports bar.  And to confirm this... (read below).  The food was very average, but I expected that given that it was mass-produced and served in catering trays for everyone that showed up.  Service was solid, servers all had a pulse.    Oh yeah, love it when the hostess opens the door for the guests and greets with a smile.  Not all restaurants do that, they should.  dmo out."}
{"text":"Outside of their wings being so delicious the rest of their menu leaves me less than impressed. Certain items on their menu is overpriced and I know I could get the same type of food but better elsewhere for cheaper"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first visit was spectacular and the reason I came back for a 2nd visit.  That's where the sh*t hit the fan. Our server was an immature 20-something who was too busy flirting with his co-worker sitting in the table next to us. My fiance ordered a hamburger and I order the jerk chicken wings.  The flirting retard screwed up the burger order (remember these idiots want a $15/hr minimum wage...laughable) and brought out burnt wings covered in sauce that wasn't authentic jerk sauce (think they used the sauce to cover up the mistake).  If this wasn't bad enough, the idiot server attacked us with a desperate sales pitch. It seems the servers had a holiday competition that involved seeing who could sell the most gift cards. Needless to say, this terrible waiter got a shiny penny for his tip. Hopefully the co-worker he was flirting with and who he gave better service to left him a much better tip.  May go back and give them another chance but will run like hell if we have this crappy waiter again."}
{"text":"I have been here before and everything was great. This time around not so not so much. The waitress Kylie was nice a informative. I ordered some wings and the Tavern Burger. The wings were okay but way to much sauce. There was extra sauce left on the plate. The wings were fried and sauce was thrown on it. The burger can have some pink, little pink or well done. The burger has too be cooked at 150 degrees. Which means it will be a little pink to done. So the wings were silently warm. The burger was sent back and the fries were cold. The portion of fries were small. And the price for the items are over priced. For example if you want to add a side salad to your meal its a extra $6 dollars. Overall the food was okay. If it wasn't for the waitress I would have given the place 2 stars."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday for Panther's football. All of the TV's in the dining room were small, most broken, and outdated. I have a larger TV in my bedroom and I'm a 25 year old girl.... Seriously?!  They were only playing the Panthers on 1 TV, and golf on the others? Wtf? It's Sunday in Charlotte NC!  This place is a sad excuse for a sports bar. There is no reason to have such crappy tvs. I know this chain makes more than enough profit to upgrade.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Heck yes! Follow me, as I know where all the good bars are.  Came here famished, tired, in a bad mood. Guess what! They fixed me.  I don't know their names but the bartenders were awesome. When I arrived it was wayyyyy too bright in there, like the surface of the sun. I asked if they could dim the bar lights a little, and even though that's a high maintenance request, they did it with out pause.  I had the French Dip sammich! With Sweet potato fries. This was the BEST French dip I've ever had. It was lean, perfect and everything I needed. The sweet potato fries were awesome.   I've been to many Hickory Taverns many times.. but the customer service and food really stood out to me at this location."}
{"text":"Decent place for apps and standard  American bar fare.  Not a huge fan of this type of food, but if that's what you like, they do a good job.  Chicken fingers, fries and dipping sauces.  Tasty, but not great for cholesterol levels.    Mid-to-lower-mid price hangout joint / bar area.    Staff has always been friendly.  Don't see a lot of managers; but, that doesn't seem to have made a difference in a negative way.    Wait personnel, greeters, etc., all young. . .but nice."}
{"text":"An amazing and attentive staff and management team.  Food is great, drinks are cold, atmosphere is warm, fun and inviting. A great place to be with friends and family whether a quick stop in, a nice lunch or dinner or a group/private function."}
{"text":"A great place to rely on for game days. This place is no joke when it comes to football!!! It's loud, it's rowdy and it's not always kid friendly (some screamers can ruin it). The food is inconsistent but it's definitely edible. We've been on some days when the fries come out ice cold while others days, they're so hot they're still dripping in oil. The Food Truck menu is pretty tasty but they've culled it down a bit. Don't bother with dessert - just order an extra cocktail instead. This is a great option for kids meals though (see earlier mention of questionable kid friendly spot on game days)."}
{"text":"My family and I come here regularly for Oyster special night (Saturdays) each visit is wonderful & delicious, but tonight was exceptionally wonderful had the pleasure of being served by Shawn.  Shawn was attentive, patient, courteous, and professional. Tonight just so happened to be my step-dad's birthday & veteran's day (he's a Marine) and it was my first day out I'd the house in 10 days since I was discharged home after a very invasive hip surgery. Shawn made sure we enjoyed every aspect of our \"outing\"  from the second he knew that. He was delightful before, but really went above-and-beyond when he knew our story.  Anyways, food was great & Shawn was incredible!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant for lunch. It's really a sports type bar with a  number of flat screens for viewing.  I had their version of a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. The wait for food after the order was placed was longer than I would expect during lunch (about 22-25 .min in this case) When the food arrived it was good. Nothing memorable or outstanding. I'm sure this place fills a niche but it won't be on my short list of go to eateries. So-so.."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern is a small but growing chain in the North Carolina.  Serving dependable bar food with a great beer list, I can see why it's gaining popularity.  They brand themselves as a steaks and oysters place, but they are really a sports bar basically (a tastefully decorated one though with minimal tschotkes).    And a biggie for us, they were open Christmas Eve.  This location is relatively new and has a large, airy atmosphere with high ceilings and tons of TVs.  I've been to the Pinehurst location before, and ordered the same meal at both locations, the delicious Carolina burger.  As anyone that knows me knows, the best condiment for a burger is more meat.  The Carolina burger offers that meaty condiment in the form of chili paired with mustard.  The burger is above average (mostly due to only having two options for temperature, medium well or well done - they may as well ask if I want my burger bone dry or burned), but the fries steal the show - in between steak and shoestring in size, they were cooked perfectly.  They also have 1554 (in addition to Fat Tire), which helps soothe my New Belgium beer cravings.  I can imagine this place being great to watch NFL games on Sundays.  All in all, you can't really go wrong with Hickory Tavern - dependable food in a low key atmosphere with good beer.  Things could be much worse in life.  Now to get Red Oak onto the Hickory Tavern taps, and 1554 onto other restaurants taps."}
{"text":"Fun friendly good food great bar staff. Gabry (spelling) is one of the best bartenders ever. Shes always funny and fast."}
{"text":"My favorite of all the Hickory Taverns in Charlotte. Great atmosphere, plenty of room in both the dining room and bar, great beer selection, and always a place to watch any sporting event on TV. The food is good, especially the oysters, salads, and tacos. The only potential drawback is the staff. You'll either get somebody who is experienced and great, or somebody who is struggling. It's definitely a place to check out, especially if you're looking for a laid back place that can handle a group or want to catch a game on TV."}
{"text":"This is a good location with the usual great atmosphere you get at a Hickory Tavern. The layout of this location is nice and conducive to groups. We were here for a trivia tournament and they were able to easily handle multiple large groups from the tournament in addition to regular patrons. The same cannot be said for some past locations of the Team Trivia regional tournaments. It's a long way for me to travel to go to a Hickory Tavern, but I'm sure it's a good dinner spot or gathering place for a sporting event for those who live in that area."}
{"text":"We moved to the area about 7 months ago. Since then, this has been our go-to place since it is close to us, and the food is decent and predictable. Service is always good. Only one time they did not get the hamburger order correct (happens at all places). We've never had an issue here whatsoever.  Staff is friendly and we are always greeted with a smile. It is a nice setup inside and family friendly. Some of the booth benches could use some updating (leather is cracking), but otherwise fine. Service is always attentive. Selection is reasonable and prices are fair. Above average in most ways, and food is very good here."}
{"text":"Hello Friends!!  I've gone here a few times to watch a game or two or three. Usually packed.  But yesterday (06/17 -  Fathers Day) outside the party group that i was a part of (20-25 people) it was pretty bone dry.   **** Special Event ****** (Fathers Day) They had a pretty good Fathers Day special (12oz Ribeye, Side Salad, One Side and Cheesecake = 23.99. With a 10.00 gift card to spend on your next visit). However on the regular menu one can get the (12oz Ribeye, 2 sides = 19.99) which suited me fine since i don't eat sweets. But i can't pass up 10.00 gift card.  For the large group the sevice was pretty good. I'll admit even with a small group, you can have the \"why did I come here with these guys\" moment. And I had one of those moments... a few times. But that's not Hickory Taverns fault. (I just need to find better group - church familes). But my kids wanted me to come, so I had no choice, it is Fathers day afterall. (we only get 1 day so, I better not pass it up) LOL!!  The 4 waitress were great. I notice a few times where they seemed overwhelmed but they grinned and handled their business. KUDOS! The manager came out a few times just to check on everyone, that was cool.   The steak... umm umm good. Medium Rare! no problem. Even the \"Side Salad\" was great. No no nooo, not the usual rabbit food. But turkey, bacon, pine nuts, cheese, eggs. I overheard someone saying the Veggie Burger was pretty lip smackin good for the veggie lovers out there!  I'm not on this side much (northeast I suppose) but if i'm around i'd drop by for a drink or 2 or 3. (Sam Adams Summer Ale)  It may be worth a shot to come back and try the \"Bucket of Boat Trash\" (Crab legs, shrimp, Gold Band ® Vibrio free premium oysters & 2 sides). That reminds me of \"Bubba Gump\" in Charleston."}
{"text":"Hello friends,  Short and sweat. I've only came to this location in my small search for some descent oysters. Word on the streets is that they serve up a pretty descent oysters. Also, they have 69 cent oysters on Thursdays. Would have been nice if someone would have mentioned that in previous reviews. Would have saved me a trip. No worries I went through it so no other Yelper will have to. Thank me later.   In short, I didn't close the deal on the oysters but at least I now know to come after 4pm. They do have OMB on tap. And a dang good Rib-eye special.   TTFN"}
{"text":"This is a typical Hickory Tavern Sports-themed bar/tavern/restaurant.   Due to the location, they initially had a tough time getting a reliable crew for lunch. We eat lunch late, usually around 1 to 2 pm . And by then most of the peppy staff was gone leaving us with a skeleton crew. Only problems were the skeletons would go into the closet (kitchen) and not surface back for some time. Once they switched waiters on me and the bill got written up by a 2nd waitress.   Even during dinner the service can be a coin-toss, or a roll-of-the-dice (depending which method you prefer).   In recent months they seem to have found a reliable crew although I have not gone back for my late lunches - only dinner (since this is their more reliable hours).   PROS: Honest to a fault. I lost my credit card there twice and the waitress made sure she kept it stored for me until I returned days later.  Service can be quick IF you steer away from the evening 4-8 special and arrive early for lunch during peak staff  CONS I went one Thursday night for their one price Oyster Special. They did not have 1 dozen oysters that were not spoiled. The first 12 stunk so bad with that \"sour/spoled\" smell everyone at the table could tell they were spoiled (except the waitress) .  She brought out another 12, same thing. Apparently the entire case was bad and we told her she has to stop bringing out oysters from the same case as people will get sick.   I finally switched to steamed shrimp to be safe.    I've eaten oysters, clams, etc since I was 7 years old and you have to really be careful at this Hickory Tavern as many of the young waitresses - - while they try hard -- are ignorant about what good oyster should or should not smell like.   Bottomline: You're probably okay if you stick to chicken wings. Make sure your life insurance is up to date if you eat their raw shellfish!"}
{"text":"Great service and drinks. We often go for drinks and apps and then get dinner to go. Unfortunately, the last two times we have ordered dinner to go, there have been issues. I'm now 2/2 on my to go salads missing items that I additionally paid for. Very shady that only the to go orders are missing components"}
{"text":"Stopped here after dinner for desert. Had the brownie sundae. Brownie was warm and chocolate sauce was sweet but not syrupy. Waitress was courteous and efficient."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to hickory tavern although my first visit was at a different location.  I had the pecan rubbed salmon, loaded potato and asparagus. Overall it was good but not overwhelmingly so. The asparagus was nicely seasoned but the salmon was just ok.  The atmosphere is rather loud so if you're looking for intimacy the isn't the place to go.  My friend had the crab legs which she really enjoyed. I'd definitely frequent this place again and try other items on the menu.   Went back today for a to-go order - Build your own salad and crab dip. I was totally disappointed with both.  Asked for mixed greens, received iceberg. I added avocado and received 1/2 a slice.  The salmon (the protein I added) was dry, the salad dressing (ranch) was bland and the crab dip was hard and dry. I think I'm done with this place.  I spent $26 to come home to a tasteless meal."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern is a really cool spot.  I came here last Monday to meet a buddy for a drink and I was really impressed by how spacious and nice it was inside.  It wasn't busy at all which surprised me as its a cool venue and the shopping center seemed to be busy.  I can't comment on the food as I only had drinks here but I thought it was a really cool spot."}
{"text":"I do not understand why this place has only 3.5 stars. Let me tell you, the food was great, the service was great, and every major sport was on their screens. Hockey, baseball, basketball, you name it.  And then there was the Korean BBQ tacos. A lil fusion twist to it but I loved it. It almost had a hot sauce flavor in it which isn't how we normally make Korean bbq. Uf we want to make it hot, we use lepper paste called gochujang with a dufferent flavor. But it was pretty close. And you know what? Not everything has to be the same. Different is good. It's not like they hold themselves out as a Korean restaurant. Well, enough about food.  I was hoping for a highland gaelic ale, which they didn't have but a couple of good ole OMB Captain Jack did the job. Fireball shots were nice too. And service was great, too. Liz was so nice and on top of it. I'd go back soon if I could. Anyway, I had a great time with friends watching a good game and nothing went wrong so 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at how good the food was!  Most of the time sports bars or known for \"bar food\" but this was actually GOOD!  I went w/ co-workers so we had pretty much all of the appetizers on the menu.  Highly recommend the sweet potato fries and the crab dip.  Chicken fingers w/ honeymustard was redic!! (that's a good thing)   Food was served hot.  Great place to watch a game or two...or three!  And if you ladies aren't feelin' the sports bar vibe...it's only a hop and a skip to Cru Wine!!!  Just sayin...."}
{"text":"Kids meals were good, much better then mine. My burger was broken it was supposed to be mushroom and onion but two mushrooms and a few onions. Service great! Timisha was awesome!  Was surprised the 1/3 of all the people in the full restaurant were kids and out of the 12 TVs none were on kid friendly shows."}
{"text":"Steer clear of this place! The only thing worth eating is the oysters BC they're raw! The menu is very strange and needs tk be revisted. Who the hell puts slaw and pico on buffalo chicken tacos??  This place!  Oh wait, I forgot, there is a great kids meal deal, no joke...cheeseburger, which is adult size with a side (sometimes you get 2 sides depending on ur server) for 5.99. Can not beat it!!!  HOWEVER......They dedicate the outsiders enclosed HEATED patio area to smokers, which is so gross (AND THAT'S COMING FROM A SMOKER!!!)  And they prop the front door TO THE INSIDE open for the bar drinkers on the coldest day of the year. This place TOTALLY caters to their bar customers, which is fine bc it is a Tavern....but if that's the case, then make your Tavern bigger, and don't pretend the place is for people with kids and families. I guess just disappointing BC you expect more than what you receive here.  Giving it a 2 BC they do have a good wine selection and potential to make good business with their location if they knew how to manage their floor staff and kitchen, AND JUST CHANGED THE DAMN MENU.   Sad, this one too shall pass."}
{"text":"We used to come here often and it was always nice.  Decided to stop by for dinner 4/3/15, and my how things have changed. Let me start with the strawberry watermelon mojito, first one I sent back because the muddled strawberry was a little strawberry floating in the glass.  the second came with strawberry pieces in the glass, but there was no rum to be tasted.  it was more like watered down sprite with no hint strawberry, watermelon or mint to be tasted.   I sent it back for a kraeken spiced rum Mai tai.  The quality of their drinks have gone down.  Ordered the chicken quesidas, it was burnt.  My friend got the salmon, it was just salmon, nothing to write home about.  We dine out often and rate restaurants as on or off the list.  Hickory tavern is definitely off the list."}
{"text":"Came in around 6:30 and was seated immediately ... and forgotten. Several servers walked by, but no one said a word. Tried to get their attention and was ignored. Left at 6:45 and no one had been to my table. I informed the guy at the host stand and he just said 'sorry', without offering to help. Apparently the couple leaving in front of me had the same experience, as they were talking about how it wasn't very busy, but no one had served them. I like Hickory Tavern, but I don't think I'll come to this location again."}
{"text":"The food needs to be elevated quite a bit - coming from Dallas, this place is below standard and it's sad when you have to return your food 3 times - friendly people but needs to step up their game and show that you care about your customers."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, usually in a group of 4, over the past couple of years. Its location is convenient and it has a broad menu, which is why we end up there.  The food is average. The tater tots are the best side on the menu, better than the fries or chips. What makes this a two-star review is that every single time I have been, regardless of the complexity of the order (which is never that complex, it's your standard American restaurant fare), the food takes FOREVER to arrive. I have never waited less than half an hour for food there, and once, one member of our party waited an HOUR for - wait for it - a quesadilla. I could have gone to a grocery store, bought the items for it, and cooked them on my car engine in that amount of time. The manager came out once and explained nothing, just vaguely apologized for the wait. If the restaurant had been busy, it would have been more understandable, but the restaurant was at *maybe* 1/5 capacity.   For the location, it's acceptable, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't audibly groan when I end up there."}
{"text":"Okay...it seems to have gone downhill over the years, but I felt like I should leave a review because we tried it again after thinking it might get better.  The food is okay, not great quality and the service is okay.  The worst part is how terribly slow it is!  Every single time!  It's just not worth going anymore because I'm repeatedly getting disappointed."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. They were doing a trivia night which was cool. Draft beers were $3 which was awesome! The downside for me was the food.  Oysters - A - were big and fresh Charred Wings (Hot) - B- not worth the up charge Street Tacos - C - bad flavor did not like Seared Tuna - A - this was a great app    Service was decent and costs weren't bad. For me the food was the issue as it was definitely hit or miss."}
{"text":"I got the soup and salad lunch special with clam chowder.  The salad was pretty good, a lot of toppings and a good size.  The service was prompt and friendly. BUT...the soup literally had about 2 half clams. The potatoes are completely square and hard. The consistency is watery. I was beyond disappointed with it.  It ruined my whole lunch. I will not order it again...& may just not be back. I think when you pay money for something, and look forward to it...it should never be less than wonderful."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern is Hickory Tavern...what can I say?!  This location offers many tvs and plentiful space indoor and outdoor for watching them.    The service is rarely good.  Most of the time being hit or miss...it's a miss. The food is bar food and pretty average.  I enjoy the wing dinner sometimes...I have had it here and it was delicious and other times not so much.  Basically, consistency is key.  It wouldn't be half bad if they could keep a decent streamline staff.  Pleasant service should be more of a priority to ensure customers get it every time.  And food should always taste how you expect and remember it to taste. Bottom line."}
{"text":"Every time you eat here you just never know what you gonna get last time I got a burger it was great, this time same burger  was supper dry and crispy kinda old ?  Now the sweet potato fries was the other way around   not crispy at all kinda soggy actually"}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern is one of those places where the food isn't mind blowing but it's not bad either. It's defintinitely a good place to go if you want to catch a game while you eat. Consistently decent food, good beer selection, and nice service. All in all - not a bad place."}
{"text":"I was there on a Friday night a couple weeks ago and ordered the fresh tuna appetizer. ..my guest order the same with  a side of broccoli and his portion was smaller... my tuna was extremely and I asked if that was the norm ... the waitress immediately asked if I wanted to have them prepared again after we noticed my guest portion was not as salty... it was prepared again and came back okay!  I wasn't overly impressed and although I just recently moved to the area... I won't be in a hurry to return.  I remember frequenting the restaurant about 10 years ago at the same location ...but recall it being more inviting of an atmosphere and the food being superior... it feels like a different place now. ..What happened?"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant with expected bar fare, Hickory Tavern has a good, diverse menu and everything is always good.  The manager ALWAYS comes around and asks how you are and genuinely seems to be doing things rather than standing around as you see in a lot of these places.  The wait staff is always courteous and spot on.  I have had Felicia wait on my party twice in the last couple weeks and she is outstanding - friendly, helpful and expedient."}
{"text":"Decent bar food, lots of tvs, does the job for game day. Nothing overly fantastic, nothing overly terrible. Service can be inconsistent, but they can handle a panthers away game with large crowds.   As for the food, the honey bee sting wings are the perfect amount of heat and sweet. They tend to \"overdress\" their salads, so always ask for dressing on the side. They have some tasty and traditional bar food options, and their buffalo chicken tacos always hit the spot. There's something for everyone here, and plenty of tvs for every sports fan."}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches!  THE BEST Sweet Potato fries (with honey butter)!!!  Draft Beer specials on Thursday...we love to go get our 16oz Blue Moons and unwind.  The service is outstanding and always on time. Will definitely be back soon, especially since I live walking distance."}
{"text":"I have never really liked Hickory Tavern until we came to this location! Every time we visit this one the service is amazing (Staff is friendly, Mgmt checks in on your meals). When we have guests from out of town, we now always end up choosing Hickory Tavern SteeleCroft! Fave items to order are the Crab Dip, Salmon BLT and Tacos!"}
{"text":"Eaten here 4 times now. Get tuna on salad!  It's worth the $6!! Nice, classy place to enjoy a meal with a bar and pool table option. I think it's a local chain. Really good food too with vegetarian-friendly options"}
{"text":"I know it's a sports place, but it was so loud I could barely hear the server. Baldie ordered the Chicken and rice. That was pretty good. I ordered the Pork Belly Tacos. Bad choice. I really have nothing else to say. Hickory who??"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! I love to come here and enjoy the daily specials. The food is always good and so is the service."}
{"text":"Been here on two occasions. After the first visit, when the service and food were average at best, I promised myself never to return. Then I was invited here by a business associate for a weekday lunch. My expectations were much lower, the service had to be good because almost no one was there, and the food was good not great.   The overwhelming consensus is that the service here isn't consistently good, the food is hit and miss, but the prices are fair. Depends what you're looking for. If it's a beer and a game, why not? Otherwise, better options are available."}
{"text":"OMG! If you go, get the Brussel Sprout App. Outstanding! Very large space. I also had the Lobster Roll, which was very good. My husband had a Turkey Club sandwich on a roll, which he enjoyed. Many televisions to view your favorite sporting event."}
{"text":"This is a large upscale sports bar in a large upscale shopping plaza. We only had one beer here but noticed that the service was good, the prices are fair, and I liked the overall atmosphere - reminded me of Zipps in Scottsdale. FYI - Shocktop is only $3.50."}
{"text":"Oh Hickory Tavern I have such mixed feelings about you! Had a chance last week to visit this location at the Metropolitan. Great location, nice outdoor area, jammed packed (it was a Thursday night). We started our night inside while waiting for a table to open up outside. The food was good and the beers were cold. The service, however, was bad. Our waitress, Rachel, acted like she could have cared less about us. No smiles, no friendly small talk, barely any service at all. She treated us like we were a hassle. When we finally got our table outside she explained to the other waiter that she was too busy with a big table to keep helping us. Thanks, thanks a lot. Let me say this, I'm huge on service!! Food & atmosphere can be incredible but if the service sucks, it will ruin the experience. I'm just hoping she was having a bad night but it still doesn't excuse the action or lack there of."}
{"text":"Placed an order through postmates and left a note letting them now I dont eat meat. Then called to let them know i dont eat meat and not to put meat in my salad and to instead. Add an extra roll. Instead of getting what i requested i get a salad with bacon and ham in it. Called them to have the salad refunded back on my card because i had to dispose of it and was told i would just get my whole meal replaced for free. So I call the next day to have the meal replaced so i could pick it up and a manager states \"we keep the names in a call log and details of the issue, your name isnt on there\" whos fault is that? YOURS. I had proof that i called, proof that i ordered, and proof that i even left a note in the postmates order. The idiot that answered the phone at the bar messed my order up in the first place and you promise me a meal to be replaced and now you tell me no? Offering to replace the salad was generous on the 2nd managers behalf that i spoke too, but lets get a little more organized."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Thurs night oyster and shrimp specials were delicious. Best hamburger my husband ever had."}
{"text":"Went for the solar eclipse, no glasses as advertised, still had a great time.  So as back story: I worked at a 4 star resort just up the road for many years. Over two decades in the food service industry (chef/cook) so I am very observant. Not that it makes me more important then any one else, just wanted to point that out for later comments. I've come to this particular hickory tavern many times.  So like I said, no solar viewing glasses as advertised the day before via email ( boo to the advertising staff) but I had my own pin hole viewer, not a big deal to me ( yes now the staff involved knows who I am. Good.) some of the staff had their own glasses, purchased by them. They shared them freely to the guests.  The manager, bartender, servers. All of them, knowing people would be disappointed and pissy, had a great attitude. Awesome considering.  There was also a group of corporate types there. Yes I saw you, know your kind, polo shirts and acting like your better then someone paying without a corporate credit card, taking all the service teams time, looking at me like i'm a fungus ( yeah, me in the chef coat) Guess you never worked in a food service. Any who. Even with them service was stellar.  Though I didn't eat on this particular visit I'm sure it would of been great. Just like every other time I've been there. Just like the service.   One last note: to the lady who walked in at the eclipse pinnacle and cried about service and how you don't care about seeing it, that you were just hungry . Yeah. Saw you take that little girl out to see it. Cared then didn't you. Your entitled ego can just stay at home and not harass hard working people. Words cannot amount to the loathing I feel about people like you."}
{"text":"I give it a one star. The food and atmosphere is great don't get me wrong. But don't show up at 9 or later because they won't care about you. The only person worth giving a crap about as far as waitressing goes is Brittany Francis. She wasn't any if the times I went after 9pm. The cook threw the food together and it was very sloppy. My fiancee ordered boneless chicken wings and they gave her chicken tenders with BBQ on it. Then charged her for the price of the wings. We were the only customers in there and we had to wait 45 minutes on our food, and got one refill. This just means they anticipated no one coming in and started closing before the time on their website and door said."}
{"text":"Pretty good stopped in visiting from out of state. Got their signature lobster roll dish with chips. Definitely an east coast fav for me. Came in pretty late so I expected that I might get hurried out but not the case. Food was brought out very fast and staff was extremely pleasant. I savoured that meal for all it was worth and crave it now that I'm back home"}
{"text":"We were very frustrated with our visit. While it was a weekend night, it wasn't very crowded. It took 20 minutes for the hummus to come out. Everything else just took longer and longer. The food was just blah. We paid a lot, and waited a lot for what we got We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Great food, large list of different things to order and the beers are great too. Friday nights are karaoke night so go and have a blast. The prices are fair but worth it. The sweet potato fries are great too."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  Try the shrimp and grits and grape salad. Great place to watch the game and play pool."}
{"text":"Great New Year's Eve experience. Server(Kristen) was amazing and food was top notch. Try the Food Truck menu. We'll definitely be back. Hickory Tavern exceeded our expectations!"}
{"text":"After many trips to Hickory Tavern over a few years, I will say I love the oysters for 69 cents on Thursdays, as well as the salads, and the veggie burger. And, we have had good service on numerous occasions. But, we have also had terrible service several times. I rarely see a manager, and at this point, I am pretty fed up.  Out here in Steele Creek, there are not many dining or pub choices, and I and my circle enjoy cold beer and oysters, so, yes, we have been to Hickory Tavern many times.  Once,  were charged 50 cents for barbecue sauce (as a substitute for mayo/ketchup/mustard on a burger), and they refused to budge when we questioned it. A small thing, but annoyingly petty, in my opinion. Another time, they suddenly changed their Thursday beer special, and although someone in our party had asked the price, and the waitress misquoted it, we were all charged a higher price for our beers. I asked the waitress about it and she said that the price had JUST changed in the computer, and asked if I wanted her to take the difference out  of her tips. No, really, she actually asked me that. On a separate trip -- we decided to go back, but just make sure we were not in that particular waitresses' section -- a friend ordered the new flat bread with kalamata olives. It arrived with no olives, and the sliced tomato on top was pink (like salmon). My friend barely tasted it, and said it was inedible. The waitress never checked on us, and so I shared my sandwich with my friend. So she could eat! When the young waitress finally came back by the table, she asked if my friend needed a box for her pizza. My friend said no, and asked her to just take it off the bill, and they did. Which I guess was one of the classier things they have done, in my experience. The final straw was when we went ANOTHER TIME (unbelievable, I know) and ordered beers at a table in the bar area, and then waited, and waited, and waited. No drinks. Finally, we just left. It was not busy.  These days, it's hard to justify spending money to drink average, domestic beer and eat bar food out. If we're going to be treated poorly, I would rather save my money, drink better beer at home, and cook. I miss the decent,, independent restaurants and sweet little dive bars in the area in which I used to live, closer to uptown. Unfortunately, I guess these kind of places are often what you get out in the burbs. It's too bad."}
{"text":"We ate at the new location in Indian Land tonight. Very busy but we were seated right away in the bar area. Plenty of help so the drinks and food were brought out really fast. We had a Shrimp Po Boy and a French Dip. They were excellent BUT the rolls were really small for the $13 & $14 prices. We voiced our concerns to the friendly waiter who said he would confer them to the management. We will try again in a few weeks and see if the rolls have increased in length. If not, we surely will not be regular customers.i"}
{"text":"Unfortunately didn't enjoy the food at this hickory tavern. I ordered the humus as an appetizer and the smokehouse burger with chips. I also ordered sweet tea to drink. The Only thing i liked was the humus and it was very tasty. The sweet tea was way too sweet and I had to order an unsweet tea to mix with it. The smokehouse burger had a bad after taste like it was fried in old grease. The burger was about $12.00 and doesn't compare to local burger places that easily put this to shame. The service started friendly but took extremely long times to get the food (20 minutes) after appetizer and over 10 minutes to bring the check. So, I would say if you like to drink beer, this place may be great. However, for food, I would recommend something different."}
{"text":"The food here was great!  I thoroughly enjoyed my Black and Blue Burger.  It was cooked to perfection.  I didn't get to enjoy any mild libations this go around due to time constraints, but I have been on a Sunday afternoon to watch football and throw back a few, and it was definitely a good time.    I was, however, a little disappointed with our service.  She hardly came to the table, did not refill drinks, and took forever to bring the check.  You could tell she did not want to be there.  Overall, the food was good enough to outweigh the service.  In the words of The Terminator, \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"They had $.65 wing night on Wednesday night and $3 draft selection specials. I got like 15 wings and four pieces of celery. I have to say I haven't been eating chicken that long again after switching my eating habits.  However, the wings were really good last night. I was shocked too because I have been here before and order other things and it wasn't as good... not bad just not as good as last night. Another thing to try is their buffalo chicken sandwich. Real Good!  If you like it a little spicy! ;) well my attitude is spicy so I like it spicy! Ha!  GREAT PLACE TO WATCH ANY SPORTING EVENT too!!! Lots of TV's and when Football season starts up again get there early it is a mad house. Go Panthers! Atmosphere is great too.   Ask for Mallory. She is the best server there!    Lastly, so If you don't know anything about Charlotte look to me first to tell you. The parking garage is a accident waiting to happen. I normally park on the street or across from Wendy's and walk over because it is like wooooh.... trust me!"}
{"text":"This hickory tavern is just okay. A lot people come and enjoy the place for the atmosphere.   The one in the Met is much better!  We got nachos and they were okay but I do have to say the wings were good. Not as good as BBW but good on their own.   Not in a hurry to come back to this location as I would choose Duckworth's over Hickory Tavern ."}
{"text":"My 4 girlfriends and I came here after work on a Wednesday and the service was great. And the manager George, was amazing!!!  Took such good care of us and we all had a great time!!' You should come here and ask for George!!"}
{"text":"Seafood.  'Nuff said. Had Oysters on the half shell and fresh local tap beer and got out for under $20.  Came back a week later and had fresher oysters and a lobster roll that you could not see the bread for the lobster running over the darn thing.  Two beers and we still got out for less than $25.    Sports on several big screens going on at the same time as the big event for the evening on the projector TV.  Eat, drink, be merry, REPEAT!"}
{"text":"Grilled Talapia was delicious and lightly seasoned.My son ordered the wing meal and always enjoys the teriyaki flavor.  Friendly service but forgetful. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"This establishment is the best representation of meh in the physical form...  We came here because we were in the area with some friends and they suggested it...  I will never listen to them again... Okay, maybe it wasn't THAT bad, but it definitely wasn't good...   First off, I ordered a small house salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing and a half order of the BBQ chicken flatbread and the boyfriend ordered an 8 piece wing basket... I get my salad and the dressing is possibly the worst I've ever encountered, but I tried to fight through it... By the time the waitress came by again to check on us, I was just over the salad and ready for my meal, so I let it slide... They brought out the rest of the food... Apparently a wing flew out of the boyfriend's basket on the way to our table... They gave us the funny face when we brought it up and then stood next to him to count them out as if he couldn't count all the way up to 7... Not to mention, the loaded baked potato he ordered was only half cocked because there was no bacon anywhere on it... Okaaaay... Meanwhile, I'm still sitting there with a picked over salad, unappetizing dressing with no flatbread... Finally, the manager comes out and says that someone dropped my food and they'll have it out in two minutes...   Thirty minutes later, the rest of my party is finished with their food and I'm just sitting there with my empty beer glass (all of ours had been that way for quite a while, mind you... Does this HT not believe in refills?)... I called the manager back over and had to request that they box up my flatbread to go because the rest of my party was finished and asked to have it removed from my bill... I don't do that often because I understand that things happen, but I usually never have to ask because the manager offers some sort of concession when screw-ups occur... The kicker?  Since I didn't eat it that night, I tried to reheat it the next day... I don't know if it was that bland when I brought it home or if something weird happened after I put it in the oven at home, but it tasted so bad I couldn't even finish it... I'm not saying this is the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant because I'm sure that something has topped this... I AM saying I can't remember anything worse right now... lol  The only reason they get two stars is because two out of the four people at our table didn't have any issues with their meals... Maybe it was just our bad luck that time, but I won't be back to this location..."}
{"text":"We went here with some friends to watch the Panthers play this past weekend and we were pleasantly and unpleasantly surprised alike...    First off, if you're going here to watch a game on Sunday, it's pretty cool... They label the televisions to show which games will be on each particular television, which has to work out great... They're not changing the channels, though, so if you want to see a particular game in front of you, I suggest you get there early...  We sat outside and they have these awesome wicker \"couches\" with good cushions... I use quotes because they're actually individual pieces, but that's not a problem and it comes in handy (see next section)... I was worried the table wouldn't be high enough to eat from, but it turns out, it wasn't too bad... We had 5 screens in front of us and there was a nice bit of cover, so the beginning of the game was awesome...   As I'm sure you've noticed, we've had some hardcore heat coming through the area even though it's pretty late in the year, so once the sun came over that cover, it was brutal!  That's when it came in handy that we could pick up the \"couch\" and move it forward a couple feet... lol There's nothing they can do about that, though, so it's not a problem, really... Just a heads up for if you're sun-sensitive like me... Go ahead and grab a table indoors...  The other thing was it took quite a while for the food to come out and I get that they were slammed, so it is what it is... We had a constant stream of people coming to apologize, though and that was definitely appreciated...   The food was okay, but not spectacular... The boyfriend had a sandwich they had on special with buffalo chicken and three different cheeses... He said the cream cheese in it was a little overwhelming, but other than that, it was decent... In my opinion, it looked a bit like pimento cheese, so I can see how that would have happened... lol  I ordered the tavern salad and it wasn't bad, but you know how you can just taste something a little weird in a salad?  Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't put my finger on it... I will say they are not shy about the toppings, though... You should be able to find some lettuce under all that bacon, egg, ham, tomatoes and almonds... The sun-dried tomato dressing was pretty good, though..."}
{"text":"I was led to believe I had a reservation for a corporate seminar event booked in their private room.  I called and they told me they had me down.  Then I went in the first time and they assured me it was reserved, we would do a contract as we got closer.  I found this odd, but we had booked the same event the year before and there had been no problem.  Yesterday, I called with some planning questions.  They told me they weren't holding the room and if I wanted it, I had better get in and do a contract ASAP.  So today, in went in to do a contract.  The GM, Tom Blake informed me that they had a weekly group that used the room every week on that day and I needed to find another place.  I am very frustrated as I had already sent invitations with their location on it.  But, I understand people make mistakes sometimes.  The reason it is one star, is because Tom was an unbelievable jerk.  He could not care less or deliver any sort of an apology on the matter.  This man has a nasty attitude problem and lacks the basic people skills that should be required of his job.   I have already rebooked my event at another similar restaurant close by.  But I will not soon forget my horrible experience with this GM and I will never dine at Hickory Tavern again."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Hickory Taverns around the Charlotte area and this one is by far the best.  The location is in the fast growing Ballantyne area and rests next to the Charlotte Golf Links course.  Perfect for playing 18 and strolling over to the bar.    The bar/patio/restaurant areas are large and loaded with places to sit for the busy times.  Personally, I prefer the bar area for everything and it has always worked out well.  We've eaten the wings, lobster roll, and the homemade chips and loved everything (Wings - nice and crispy with numerous sauce choices).  They do a very good job of using fresh bread and ingredients for their sandwhiches.  The best meal was the Chicken Avocado sandwich.  Very healthy and very flavorful.    The only reason that I held off on the 5th star was the beer selection.  I thought it was rather lacking on the draft choices.  Other than that, they have great daily drink specials and surprisingly delicious oyster days.  TVs and large projection screens on every corner and wall -- I cant ask for anything more than that.    Having said all that, you pretty much get what you see here.  Big Sports bar with quality service, food, and atmosphere.   Enjoy!    -Ian M."}
{"text":"Friendly place with above average bar food and excellent service.   We went to check out a BBQ place but thanks to an outdated GPS we headed to the now closed Sticky Fingers. We were hungry and checked this place out instead. I had the pulled pork burger which is a large portion of BBQ restaurant quality pulled pork on top of a burger and was very impressive. This came with a side of homemade potato chips and I had some excellent sweet tea to accompany. We also had the pulled pork quesadilla appetizer and recommend that as well.  This isn't a must try place but I'd check it out if you're in the area as it was a tasty meal with very friendly service. I didn't get a beer but they also seemed to have a decent selection here."}
{"text":"Lots of Tvs and great food. Love the large booths too. Been here several times and loved it every time. I like the crab legs!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Run of the mill in every way. I feel like the servers should be wearing \"pieces of flair\" while they tell me they'll be taking care of me tonight. Barf.  Good specials tons of tv's and reasonably priced everything."}
{"text":"This place epitomizes generic. I've been unlucky enough to be dragged here at least 3 or 4 times by one of my girlfriend's friends and every time is the same blur of aging yuppies and redneck douchebags.  The whole place screams of suburbian blandness; down right to the food and the wall decor. They do have a decent beer selection but 99% of the patrons stick to light beers or some other cocktail.  Overall, it's not painful but not an ounce of originality or individuality here."}
{"text":"The salads on the menu sound good but taste awful.  I really dislike microwaved precooked chicken and I also really dislike bagged lettuce.  My children had Kraft macaroni and cheese that was re-heated, probably in a microwave.  The server was nice and friendly but would not come around all that often.  I use to be a server.  She could have turned our table very fast.  Any parent with little ones would want and expect that.  My husband did not care for his meal either.  He got buffalo tacos and the tortilla's were not even warm."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern is a solid sports bar.  Plenty of tv's with lots of different sports on and good viewing from every seat ( not that I tried them all).   The menu is typical for a sports bar with salads, wings, burgers, sandwiches, flatbreads, etc.  The food is good, though not exceptional.  Service was very good and the ambiance is nice. Overall, a great choice for families and to catch a game."}
{"text":"$17 for an over cooked piece of pork medallion and 12 sweet potato fries - yes I counted - 12! Seriously you guys think that's acceptable - that's on top of waiting nearly 2and a half hours for our food - at he point where I got it I was too hungry to take back by the sever knew we weren't happy - still nothing"}
{"text":"Lacey is the bomb. We had a awesome time. She even gave me a nick name. The oysters were the best I have ever had...WAZZZ UP. Great food Great beer."}
{"text":"As far as family dining/pub hybrids go, Hickory Tavern is usually a safe choice. as a chain, you know what to expect. My thoughts on this one is that the owners went a bit too far when calculating what people liked at other locations. Specifically, the place really isn't that big, but it has 25 Televisions. It is just too much. The flashing images from literally every direction became annoying to me.  There are some cool quotes on the wall. I like that, but the bar itself has creepy lighting. I mean that. Like \"The Shining\" creepy.   The service was pretty quick and friendly. The pint of beer I ordered was so cold it had ice crystals still on the glass from the freezer. I always like that.   All in all, this place is fine for a beer before catching a movie, but I wouldn't want to spend too much time. Also, if you are looking for a social place, both times I visited, the place was fairly empty, but both times were weeknights at about 10 PM or so."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of celebrating Fat Tuesday's at  Hickory Tavern in Huntersville and it was great!  I got to spend time with old friends and made some new friends while enjoying such cuisines as shrimp and grits with bacon and cheese, perfectly fried chicken tenderloins, juicy beef burgers, smoked chard brussels sprouts with bacon, sweet potato fries, hickory's famous fry chips and a beautiful and tasty chefs salad!  And yes everything taste just as good as it sounds! The Brussels sprouts are a must try on your next visit to the tavern! And since it was a mardi Gras theme desert was a Louisiana baby cake and Mardi Gras themed cupcakes!  Christina and Roy were on hand to make sure we were taken great care of! The servers were friendly and hands on!  Roy told us about a few of the specials and one that stood out was the $12.99 shrimp boil on Sunday. Hickory Tavern has several locations throughout NC  and they all have the same delicious food! If you're looking for a place to have and event, hang out with friends or a family friendly place Hickory Tavern is a great spot."}
{"text":"Big place, lots of tv's, good food and beer. Voted Charlottes number 1 tavern.  The service is friendly and fast.  Try the Reuben for a great handheld sandwich. Bring friends or just drop in for a couple of pints, very large selection of draft and bottles."}
{"text":"I know I've given them multiple chances since it is conveniently located near work for me, and I keep thinking that this is going to get better.  The times I have gone here or have gotten take out, it has only been for lunch.  I think that the food is always good, so that's the reason that I go back, but the service is not all that spectacular.  I've had many bad experiences hoping that it'll just get better and am still waiting for it to happen.  Once experience I had, I had gone out to lunch with my coworkers and ordered a Build Your Own Salad and had requested for some fried chicken.  Our food came out, but the friend chicken came 15 minutes after my salad had come out.  The server asked me (with a sort of attitude) if I still wanted the chicken or not.  I said sure.  The manager asked if everything was okay, I told him of the situation, and he didn't seem that concerned, but he did take 50% off my bill.    Other experiences I've had, I have learned to now check if my food is correct for take out before getting back to work.  Examples: No extra ranch when I asked for it, another time, I had ordered sweet tea to go only to find out once I got back to the office they gave me unsweet tea, having to ask them for ketchup when I already told them in my order that I wanted some ketchup on the side.  It's those things that have happened to me.  I just hope that they can step up their game because I do enjoy their food, but their service just really needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"Friendly place to go for drinks.  The menu has a variety of items to choose from. Everything is prepared fairly quickly and tastes good.  They make a mean rum and coke!  It's a casual but fun atmosphere, the tvs are always on playing whatever sporting event is happening that particular day. Sometimes it can be packed, but generally it's not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Woot woot! I love me some Hickory Tavern - this chain is blowing up! I like Hickory Tavern for their selection of drinks, their plentiful TVs, and most of all, their WINGS! They have a special offer for tailgating (to go) with all your traditional tailgating foods, and they even have a suggested menu for game-watching in the restaurant. Of those offerings, I'll talk about three of them here.  THE FOOD:  I tried the brats (not a fan - mine was under cooked and tasted like beer... not just beer-flavored, but I think I got a buzz from eating two bites!). Now, their wings are what makes them a winner! Get them extra crispy and with ranch (who orders them with blue cheese anymore - weirdos, that's who!) He he! On top of that, their ranch is equally good (any true wing connoisseur knows the ranch is VERY important!) I also tried the chicken salad sliders which were delicious. They were made with whole meat white chicken breast (not the canned junk), mayo of course, thinly sliced celery and dried cranberries that gave it the perfect sweetness.   THE VENUE: This is a brand new location (in the same building/area as the Target, Best Buy, Trader Joe's... It was really cool inside. It's part of a chain so it's similar to the other locations I've been to (this restaurant chain is blowing up!), but had some features that were really unique. I loved the chrome quote on the bar wall. They have tons of TVs to watch any/every game your sports-loving-heart desires. They have a ticker, yes a ticker, for sports scores above the hostess stand. There's a huge and well-appointed bar with cool lighting. Plus all the seating you could need. They host all the home Panthers games, and get this, at each game they do a raffle for free Panthers swag. Nice! Parking was a breeze in the deck - it's crowded but what deck isn't. I'm also glad parking was free. What can I say, I'm cheap!  So, go for the beer/drinks, TV, wings and open atmosphere. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place used to be great when they opened a couple years ago. Now the menu had changed to be smaller and the prices have gone up considerably and too top it off the food usually takes 45 mins no matter what time you come in. If you have a larger party service turns into crap. It's unfortunate because this place is so close to my house, but to many disappointments for me to come back here. Hopefully they get the hint with these not so stellar reviews."}
{"text":"Had the seafood bayou plate with salmon.  Tasty rice, decently healthy steamed veggies, and the shrimp were tasty.  Fish was a little salty for my taste..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to watch the game great selection of beers, super AMAZING STAFF GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE when I mentioned my onion ring tower was kind of sad looking under my breath with no one around the manager came to ask me what was wrong with my meal which was shocking but also awesome the attentiveness I was like how did he hear me say that and everyone at the table was also shocked. Great place will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go-- Sunset at the Met -- good live music.  Our waitress/service was excellent-very tentative.  The food was good.  We shared a couple plates-Philly Cheese Steak with fries, and we started with Pork Belly tacos.   They offer limited time specials, and the Pork Belly Tacos was one of four choices.  It's a piece of fried pork belly, pickled onions and lettuce with a wasabi sauce.  The taco was OK.  Pork belly a little over cooked, and only one small piece.  It was basically a soft tortilla with a LOT of lettuce and very little pork belly.  The wasabi sauce was awesome, but probably wouldn't order again or recommend. Overall, the food and service is always good.  Unlike the fact they offer different options, let's see how they can improve and deliver on those limited time specials."}
{"text":"Stay away from the oysters.  The steaks are not bad (you can do better).  The staff are somewhat friendly, but they mean well.  All in all, if you're ever in Charlotte and you don't get a chance to go here, no worries.  My only suggestion is to go here when you need to meet up with large groups..."}
{"text":"We had a bad experience with service. It took more than 20 minutes to be greeted by our waitress and another 60 minutes to receive our mediocre dinner.  Drink order was wrong. The dinning room was not terribly busy, so I'm not sure why it was so bad. I've been to several other Hickory Taverns and it's usually good. This location by far was the worst. Would recommend going down the street to Wild Wing Cafe instead."}
{"text":"Had plans to go to Zoe's and they were closed due to no power. It was game day so not the best time to go to hickory tavern. Ended up having to sit outside, it was pretty cool out esp in the shade, finally got to move to a table in the sun and it was nice. The food is ok, typical bar stuff, our server was good... I ordered hot tea since i was cold, drank about 1/2 and my friend says 'you realize there is lipstick all over that cup'. gag. They brought another but I felt a manager should have come over or at least they could have removed the tea from my bill.."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a couple of times. This was my first time at this particular location. The food was good by American chain restaurant standards anyway. I enjoyed my chicken tenders and my fiancé really enjoyed his burger. Our waitress however was pretty subpar. She seemed very disinterested and never made it to refill my drink. I'd return though based on other positive experiences. Also the bar atmosphere is great for sporting events and such."}
{"text":"Worst service and food I have ever had and I've lived in Charlotte all my life and have a high standard of service. Don't waste your money . The bartender was more concerned about smoking cigarettes and serving an old roomate than waiting on my husband and I . I  always tip st least 20% or more since my husband is a restaurant manager. McDonald's has better customer!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and been disappointed each time. It's a chain in Indian Trail and so it's an easy popular place to meet friends locally. Great to just go for drinks. The food is terribly over priced though and not anything special. So I don't get it why people suggest it anyway. They do have a great patio with a firepit and flat screen though. So a few friends and I decided to go watch the game and have some drinks on the patio and sit by the firepit. We were told by the hostess that the firepit was \"broken\". Oh. She said she thought the manager could fix it though. We sit by the closed unlit firepit. Order drinks. Then the manager comes out and asks how he can help us. I said we came here to sit around the fire pit and asked if he minded cutting it on. It was a chilly night recently. He said its broken. And walked away. Well, okay. Not going back."}
{"text":"Not bad. The place is huge and we did not have to wait very long at all. By the time we went to the bar we had a seat. We only went in for a small bite but everything was good. The waitress was super nice and most likely make the meal. We would go back for sure"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly. Had a variety of games on tv. The Hickory BBQ burger and the house chips were delicious!"}
{"text":"Seated quickly for lunch on a Friday. Ashley our waitress was great. She explained the drink specials and even convinced me to try something new on the menu based on what I was planning to get. And she was right...the blackened shrimp po boy is even better than the regular one!"}
{"text":"Three girlfriends and I wanted a close-by spot for a girls' night out so we selected Hickory Tavern.   It was a Friday night so we anticipated a wait but quickly found a high-top table in the bar area. The hostesses were not extremely friendly with their greetings but we found seating on our own.  Our waitress was attentive and responsive. Appetizers came pretty quickly and so did our first round of drinks. The waitress seemed confused by some questions posed to her and misinformed one of my friends about wing preparation but overall her service was \"ok\".   The spinach and artichoke dip was really good but had a high chip-to-dip ratio. A little larger portion of dip would have been great. Three of us ordered wings which were rather tasty. My customary small Tavern salad was great as always. And the drink special was wonderful, $5 fireball shots (can't ever go wrong with fireball shots).   Food was better than the overall service and we will definitely go back to our \"neighborhood\" spot."}
{"text":"Usually pretty pleased with my experiences at Hickory Tavern. Tonight started off a little differently. Not crowded for a Saturday evening, we chose open high-top seating. There was a large party next to us. We waited. And waited. And waited. Finally my husband had to approach the hostess station to ask that someone please at least take our order. So another waitress came to the rescue.   I ordered a shrimp po boy plain with only roumelade sauce. It arrived with pickles. Augh. I didn't say anything because who knows how long it would have taken to get me a fresh roll, not spoiled by pickle \"juice\". I abhor pickles. A tad dry and light on sauce, the manager was kind enough to bring me another one.   The live music made things a tad better.   Will give this location maybe one more try.   Another attempt on 8/18/2017... We were not greeted very warmly tonight and we almost left before being seated. We were told that there was about a ten minute wait but high top tables were first come, first served as always. When we approached an empty high-top table, we were escorted back to the front door and told some excuse about \"the way the kitchen was set up\" that we couldn't sit there. Irritated, we complied. Not less than two minutes later, we were given the same table.   Thankfully, our server, Chloe, was more cordial than the hostesses. And our food was good.  I had honey bee sting wings with a small tavern salad...my usual. The wings are always cooked to perfection, not \"too\" hard. And you have to have the tavern salad here with the house dressing. I have mine without tomatoes. The proportions of ingredients is perfect.   The jury is still out... not sure I can patron this location too many more times. Love the chain, just may have to return to a former location."}
{"text":"Grilled wings are AWESOME!  Always a good experience here. I must somehow steal their wing sauce recipe.    Servers are always polite too. Will come back soon."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight.    Service was terrible.  Starting when seated the hostess told us she was still preparing the utensils so we needed to wait for 10 minutes.   Keep in mind the restaurant was maybe 10 percent full.    The server was terrible.   She was clearly not interested in serving our table or any others.  Although I am sure our table was her only one.     Food was cold server was inattentive.  My wife spoke kindly to the manager pointing out areas he should consider improving.    The manager looked smiled and stated he was not interested.     He clearly was not interested in any suggestions to improve.    It will be a long long time before we are back"}
{"text":"Nice hickory tavern. Great for kids with all the tvs around. Food was done well. Nachos are great to share but we got a large and that was way too much for just two people. It would be great for a table though. The house salads are very good."}
{"text":"Mark of a good restaurant that is trying?  They handle problems quickly.  A group of us went Saturday night.  I ordered wings with sweet potato fries and guacamole.  When the food arrived, the wings were cold and there was no guac.  When I asked, I was told that they were out of guac.  Had I not asked, would I have been told?  I hate to complain to wait staff but my wife mentioned the wings.  To their credit, they did bring me a fresh batch nice and hot.  One knock, they brought our food out in 3 waves over a 3-4 minutes period.  Those served first had that awakard \"do I start eating\" look.  Haha."}
{"text":"The salad I got wasn't bad. Just super small. I think it was the fiesta salad. It came in a small bowl. Thought its be bigger. The chicken that came with it was about 3 fingers big. And well say it was Girly fingers. Haha very small pieces. Thought there would be more chicken. Panera Bread has the same salad for way cheaper and the portion is way bigger. When it comes to dinner time, they shouldn't serve lunch sized portions to hungry ppl."}
{"text":"I really used to enjoy this place as a friendly neighborhood bar and restaurant. Our last few visits have gotten worse and worse. Today we came after a movie, arrived at 3:30 which was the slow time. It was relatively empty but we sat unattended until the manager asked another table and then us how we were doing. Finally we ordered our food, the waitress was overwhelmed as more tables came in but no other servers seemed to be taking tables. About five of them were huddled at the hostesses stand while we sat and waited for our check and to go boxes. We waited so long I no longer wanted my box to take my subpar food. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I've been to that doesn't have mashed potatoes. Decent food though."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern is your typical sports bar, but definitely one I enjoy! The service and food have never disappointed.  Hickory Tavern is a large space, located in the Metropolitan shopping center.  Parking can be a pain, but once your parked and inside allow yourself to enjoy the TVs, with sports on all over, and the food. I especially love their burgers.  I am a pretty basic burger girl, classic cheeseburger, but it always cooked to my liking and the fries are great! Overall a great venue to watch a good game and enjoy great food!"}
{"text":"Wings are really good here. New side : Brussels sprouts & bacon - to die for!! Kids menu good too. They get 2 sides & Oreo cookies. Lots of tvs to see all the college football games. Huge beer list. 30+ NC breweries represented plus all the usual suspects. Great place for college football !!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING I ordered the lobster plate to go. I finished it at home, at about 7 pm. A few hours later I was vomiting (4 x) and the other \"end\" into the morning hours (about 3 a.m.) If there was any way to press charges I would but it's hard to prove food poisoning, but it was, I'm never going there again and highly recommend that you avoid it."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends to have a few beers and some food. From the moment we walked through the door everything was perfect. The hostess opened the door and smiled at us like she had been waiting for us for years. She seated us at our table and we were promptly greeted by our server Blair. Blair was so sweet and attentive. I felt like I was back at home with my mother taking care of me. We started off with a round of beers and some shredheads which are a MUST HAVE if you visit this place. For my entree I has the BEST rueben I've ever tasted. I will definitely come back and I suggest you go check it out!"}
{"text":"The kitchen closes at apparently 10:00 pm on a Saturday night. It seems to me that the kitchen is always close apparently. When you walk in it's almost a \"help yourself atmosphere\". Save yourself some time and trouble and go to the other hickory tavern on E Arbor Drive."}
{"text":"Waiter and Waitress are always friendly! I always get the half shell oyster and they are almost always fresh. Along with the Oyster I tend to like their tater tots without salt!"}
{"text":"I like the location.  It's an affordable dine-in option at the MET (affordable comparing to Dressler and Vivace...).  I can keep my $$ and still enjoy the patio and the view (and the jazz music if there's a concert happening) I particularly enjoy the fact that they offer half portion on appetizers and a la carte on the tacos.  The half nacho was plenty big, for $5. Sold!  Their small tavern salad (also $5) was filling too, and I had mine with the cucumber wasabi dressing, which defintely has a kick to it.  The lobster salad side I added was a little too salty (crazy statement coming from me) and not sure if it's worth $6.  Next time I'll pair my small salad with a shrimp taco or something.   Plenty of TV for the sports addicts.  Decent beer specials ($3 or $4 pint of Shocktop, or was it Blue Moon... getting old, I can't remember much) .  The space inside actually isn't that big, but they have a nice private room that I think is great for a special gathering.   Definitely a great weekend hang out during the day when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times & no major problems.  Decided to go for wing night.  Big mistake.  They also have some trivia/music thing going on & it was way too loud.  It was my kind of music but it was simply too loud & no reason for it.  Will never go back on that night."}
{"text":"Standard Chain bar affair.  If your looking for somewhere to eat and have ample tv's to glare at, this fits the criteria.  The setup is very similar to all the other sportsbar/dark eatery's (fox hound, kilts, etcs).    I got a domestic beer for about $4.50 and chicken tacos for about ~$10. The food wasn't on the cutting edge of a food tasting experience, but they were still tasty.  One word that sums up Hickory Tavern is consistency. They are consistently okay, which isn't bad."}
{"text":"5 years ago I would have rated Hickory Tavern a solid 4 stars.  But the bar has lost the service and cleanliness it once had.  Food prices went up, food quality went down, and the place has gotten filthy.  From the floor, to chairs, to baby seats - everything has a sticky touch to it.    Beer is ridiculously overpriced.   Burgers are meh - you'd be better off going to Saveeda's for a burger.  Much better taste and the cheaper.  Or just drive to Waxhaw and get Rippingtons or Maxwell's tavern to go and eat at the brewery...  I hope they can renovate or deep clean the place, work on getting their menu shored back up - then maintain it.  I just don't bother going there anymore."}
{"text":"Good food their tavern Burger is amazing along with their turkey club!  My kids love their wings!  Service is really good!"}
{"text":"Good place for a drink and some snacks.  The oysters are awesome."}
{"text":"I wasn't too fond of hickory tavern. I got the philly cheesesteak and it was incredibly dry and lacked flavor. Usually I power through and eat all my food, but I didn't mind not finishing this dish. I got fries with it and they weren't bad. We also got chips and queso as an appetizer. While the queso was good, the chips were stale. This was my first time at the hickory tavern and I wouldn't choose to go back."}
{"text":"Great to be back at Hickory Tavern after only six years. Oops. Met a friend here for lunch on a weekday. Not much has changed. It's still sports bar and though not nearly as crowded at this time of the day/season.  I had the pimento cheese burger (and brought another cheeseburger home for my wife). The burgers were cooked perfectly, topped well and with a good portion of fries that were hot and also cooked nicely. A very nice meal.  Service was great and the TVs weren't too loud that we couldn't have a conversation while eating."}
{"text":"When I visit a restaurant, select a dish of my preference, and the dish arrives hot and tasty, I am a happy camper.  My selection was the Seafood Bayou with tilapia and shrimp both grilled to perfection.  The steaming hot entree was served over Tavern Rice with a side of fresh fruit that was absolutely delicious.  Being in a Tavern, I had to order something to drink.  I opted for the hard apple cider which tasted pretty much like an apple martini with a bit less punch.  It was quite tasty and I had to remind myself to sip rather than drink!  For dessert, the chocolate cake sounded delicious but I could not stuff any more into my mouth.  Although I drive by regularly, I had forgotten Hickory Tavern was at this location.  I enjoyed my meal and anxiously look forward to my next visit.  This lunchtime visit was superb.    I almost forgot to talk about the sweet potato fries!  They are fabulous with honey drizzled on top (or you can have it on the side)!  If you are not afraid of something that tastes good, give them a try.  NOTE:  Since the hubs and I had the kids with us, an evening meal in a Tavern would have been out of the question."}
{"text":"We just walked out of this location 10 minutes ago. Hostess was playing on her cell phone when we walked up. Then just stared at us. No greeting just \"how many?\". She gets the menus and turns around and walks away. No \"follow me please\", not a word. She walks to the back of the restaurant and puts the menus down on a table and walks away. Never said a word. Not to mention her hair was a complete mess. Also the chefs were out front smoking. They should we out of site of the customers. We are now at the location on Harris Blvd where the service is a lot better."}
{"text":"The location at WT Harris and Statesville Road is like the cafeteria for our office staff.  I'm in there at least twice a week. Had lunch there today in fact.  Good enough beer list, good enough food, good enough service so we keep coming back.  Mostly because it's accross the street from the office and therefore really handy for lunch or after work.    Oyster night (Thursdays) is a great deal.  Pint night on Tuesdays is great too."}
{"text":"Overall good food.  Came for a saturday dinner and drinks, stayed for the margaritas and live music. Happy Cinco de Mayo.  BTW, a free Concha is always welcomed."}
{"text":"The wings were good, the beer selection was respectable, and the menu featured a nice build your own salad option which was nice to see. The service was friendly and sassy for a bunch on a work trip. I noticed a nice outside seating area and a party room that was in use for a work function. Is it special? Not particularly, but it is a solid option if you are in the mood for that type of fare, good for family, friends, work, the game, etc. I would come here for the game before i would bww."}
{"text":"We had a late evening meeting which left us with empty stomach and no time to cook up a meal. We passed by Hickory Tavern, realized we hadn't eaten there yet and decided to give it a whirl. I wish Duckworth's had been open at the time because we would have definitely gone there over here in a heartbeat. Hickory Tavern offers the fare of a pub but with a chain restaurant quality that is just lacking a bit.  Hickory Tavern is located among a couple of other stores and restaurants a little past Birkdale Village. The parking was ample and we strolled in around 7:30ish. The place was pretty slow and we had no trouble snagging a patio table, with only two other parties eating out there at the time. Our server was very attentive but service was pretty dang slow considering how quiet the place was.  I ordered the Tavern Burger ($9.30) which was a simple, overpriced cheese burger. You can only order the burger medium well or well, which is something I hate about getting a burger at a chain establishment. Despite the fact I ordered it \"slightly pink\" it came out \"not a trace of pink.\" It was a decent size, but I didn't think the quality was worth over nine bucks. It did come with a side, and I chose the fruit cup, which was decent.   The missus' went with the Build Your Own Salad ($8.50) and added shrimp to it for an extra $3. The vegetables were ok but not all the greatest quality for an entree salad. If my burger was overpriced then her salad was even more so, seeing how adding any protein to the salad would have cost more than my burger.   I was not impressed with Hickory Tavern. It was overpriced for what you get, and the quality of the food was just sub-par. There are plenty of other alternatives in the area that offer the same bar-like experience with better food and prices. I don't think I'll ever step foot inside again."}
{"text":"Food is decent bar food but everytime I have had an ingredient missing from my food. (Bacon off my sandwich, mandarin oranges off my salad, etc.) The problem is fixed without issue but it is still annoying that it continues to happen. They have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"I came a few months back and was completely unimpressed by the whole experience. We were hungry and needed lunch. The food was not particularly memorable, service less so. We didn't order drinks, although I hear they have plenty of options.  All in all, I'd say that it's a decent location to watch a game and have a drink. For me, however, the sheer number of TVs was overwhelming and my entire meal felt pretty schizophrenic.   It will do in a pinch, but not my first or sixth choice, for that matter. There are much better options at the Met."}
{"text":"This was my second time at this location. The first time I was not overly impressed, but we decided to give it another chance.   Last night myself and two others went in for dinner. We asked for a beer menu (last time there was a laminated list) we were handed a hand written list, much shorter than the list last time. This is a sports bar and should definitely have a better beer list than a hand written list. Then it came time to order our food; I ordered boneless WINGS, one other a burger and the other a salad. When the food came, the burger was wrong and it had shredded cheese instead of sliced cheese (starting to get a cutting costs unnecessarily feeling). My BONELESS WINGS were in fact chicken TENDERS. There is a difference here. The meat tastes different in these two cuts of chicken. The food runners were very rude about my dissatisfaction. Simply said, \"that's how they come\". Well, the menu shouldn't say BONELESS WINGS then. I tried the tenders, but it just wasn't good so I sent it back and got a burger. The server was rude about me sending it back and a manager never came to check on our table. A table sent food back and a manager just didn't care.   Also, the live music was horrible and entirely too loud. We had to yell at each other to talk. The hosts didn't want to actually sit us, pushed us to the bar seating which is first come first serve. When we came back and said it was full they also seemed annoyed they actually had to do some work. Overall, it's been a long time since I was this disappointed in an experience at a restaurant.   My friends and I will definitely not be returning to this location and will certainly drive another 3 minutes down the road to go to Buffalo Wild Wings for a sports bar and real boneless wings in the future."}
{"text":"Wow ....one of my go/to spots for a meal, but they let me down this -time.  They had a big group in for 'graduation l, which, I guess everyone else takes a back seat.  After 20 minutes I had a napkin,,no drink, no order....I decided to walk.  Really disappointing....Manager!  Are you paying attention??  May not ever go back..."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. I loved the chicken colorado. Management seems to be interested in how to customers feel which is always a good sign."}
{"text":"I went having never heard of the Hickory Tavern. I sat at the bar - all the bartenders were very friendly. I ordered the shrimp tacos based on feedback from one of the bartenders. They have a great on tap beer selection.  I would go back if I were in this area. The food was good, beer was good and prices very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was excellent! My husband ate the shrimp and grits and loved it. I built my own salad and it was exactly what I needed. I had their bacon honey mustard and it was amazing! Large selection of beers to try. Many were local and some were from other areas."}
{"text":"The manager was great, he made sure to find the college football game we wanted and put it on both inside and outside TVs! However, the problem is in their service. We sat outside with our pup and they completely ignored us. There was also broken glass all over the ground, meaning I had to clean it so our dog was safe! Not the best... The food was pretty good! But not good enough that I would come back to be ignored!"}
{"text":"The workers are super friendly at this location. I had a small side of hummus and a BYO salad ( mixed greens, chick peas, avocado, onions, olives,  and balsamic. The menu was pretty vegetarian friendly, but not so much vegan friendly, but I made it work!"}
{"text":"We have been full time RVers for 10 years, traveling coast to coast and border to border.  We go to a lot of restaurants.  We had martinis, appetizer, burgers w baked potato side, all excellent.  Our waitress, Mindy B, was pleasant, friendly, efficient, and attentive.  We believe she provided the best service we have had anywhere and she helped provide us with a peak experience.  This is a serious sports bar w 30 large screen TVs (including those in the rest rooms), according to the manager.  Must be a wild place during Carolina Panthers games."}
{"text":"SPORTS BAR! Serious sports bar, 20 flat screens, 2 of them 5' x 8'. Seating all arranged so there is no way not to see a flat screen. If you turn your head away you are looking at another flat screen. The only way I could not see a flat screen was by looking down at the floor or up at the ceiling.   Really cool looking place. Beautiful interior and upscale from most sports bars. It actually looked a lot like the Sports Book in a Las Vegas Casino.   I was with 4 others and we sampled many items for our massive over filling lunch.   Service was excellent, 5 stars   I ordered the Rubin Sandwich, everyone else had wings, burgers, chicken and Phili Steak.   I would rate most of the food 3 stars, except the Rubin which I rate at 4 stars. The wings were not good and I penalize them severely for being a sports bar with very average wings.  I woulg go back for a second try."}
{"text":"Burger was ok at best. Chicken wings were decent. Was only option in the area we were staying late at night."}
{"text":"Left on hold for a good 10 minutes to place a take out order.  Got home and took a few bites...RAW chicken wings and cold, hard fries.  I don't know what's going on over there, but food quality is definitely slipping.  Hoping I don't end up really sick tonight.  I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! The wings and oysters are amazing!! You cannot go wrong with them. The staff was extremely friendly and gave great customer service. Definitely going back next week!"}
{"text":"Great food at this location. Quick service and friendly atmosphere. Had the crab dip appetizer and a lobster roll. Fresh and tasty is the best way to describe it. I would recommend this location for a meal"}
{"text":"My local drinking hole! I love this place! Just a perfect balance most of the time! Except UFC NIGHT. No one can handle that many d-bags in one area at a time! AFFLICTION OVERLOAD! But serious ballentyne and prov. Rd location are my people love y'all!"}
{"text":"We used to go to the store in Providence, which was always pretty good, and if it wasn't they'd fix it. How to grab meal tonight at the location on Johnston Road. We ordered off the \"food truck\" menu, simple chicken with rice dish. It tasted like it was cooked last Sunday - chicken was dry and the rice was old. We asked for the sauces to be on the side but both came with one of them on the dish. I was hungry so I ate mine, but my friend sent hers back. Having tasted how dry and tired the meal was I figured my friend would look out by having hers cooked fresh, but I was wrong. She waded in with a few bites and then send it back; the manager came over and asked how the meals were and we told him and he did nothing. I couldn't be bothered to complain. But they have to fewer customers. OK place for a drink but they really Ought be embarrassed at the quality of the food they send out. The manager said chicken with rice was one of their most popular dishes."}
{"text":"Parking is atrocious! Don't waste your time on the Spinach Artichoke dip it's not any good. But the Build Your Own Salad is very very good."}
{"text":"Great place just to grab drinks, and watch the game, I come here often but definitely not for the food the food here sucks in my opinion, but the drinks are pretty good. So if you live in the Steele creek area like myself and just want to watch the game and have some drinks with other sports hollering fans this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Overrated applebees. The menu was fine and they seated us (table of 7) quickly. Nothing special but for the picky eaters (chicken fingers and fries) it was a win."}
{"text":"They have my beer--Angry Orchard Hard Cider! and on special..  The chips and queso were crisp, perfectly salted, hot and delicious.  It was only two of us but they gave us a booth for ten...Tiffany was awesome and very accommodating.  Great place to sit and talk with an old friend.."}
{"text":"This place has been the best thing around this area. Above average food, wide selection of beer AND alcohol plus entertainment often including cover bands. This is my wife and I local bar. Agree service is a bit slow but expected when crowded."}
{"text":"No wonder this place has terrible reviews. My family and I went here for lunch on a Sunday. We waited 10 minutes before walking out.  There was a family in front of us that was waiting to be seated. They finally got someone to sit them. The place wasn't busy at all. Several employees made eye contact with us.  Not a single person said, \"it will be a few minutes\" or even acknowledge we were waiting.   We couldn't figure it out. Somewhat of an empty restaurant and no service! Not going back there again."}
{"text":"Yesterday was mother's day and my family and I made a reservation earlier in the week to eat here. They had the table ready for us when we arrived and we sat down immediately. Our waiter was extremely nice and patient with everyone. We got our drinks and food in a very timely manner and everything was delicious. No one had any problems with their food, except one and the waiter fixed it before she could even tell him what was wrong. My drink from the bar was excellent. Great lunch for all 13 of us!"}
{"text":"Ugh, where do I start.  We arrived at 7:00pm and were promptly seated. Ten minutes later our waitress came over to take our drink order. I ordered a Diet Coke with several lemons (seeing that I need to clean the sticky mess off of the table, and lemon juice works well). While we were looking over the menu I did not see the Turkey Burger that the website said they had. Our waitress overheard us and told me that they still have it, so I ordered it. Five minutes later she returned to inform me that they in fact did not have the turkey burger. So, I ordered the California chicken sandwhich and a baked potato. It was 45 minutes later that we finally got our food. The rubber, mediocher chicken was plain, tough, and not worth $10. We begrudgingly ate the sub par food and were ready to leave. Again, the magical, disapereing waitress was nowhere to be found. When we finaly got her attention and she took my credit  card and check. She returned with a merchant copy for $4.61. I think she made a mistake so I attempted to get her attention to no avail. I then waved at another server, who pretended not to see me. The hostess walked by me and the exact same response. I finaly got a manager who thanked me for pointing out the error and returned with a corrected bill. So the issue beside the poor service and so- so food is, when a customer is asking to speak to you, waves his arms, shouts out \"Excuse me\" and is still ignored, that's the last straw. We will never go back (and my wife and I are fat, so we eat a lot).  Lastley in an effort to save time, Christina B. of Hickory Tavern may forgo sending me her canned, patronizing, smug response of \"Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I've forwarded your remarks to the regional manager to address. He'll look into it immediately. \"  That dribble will not only be wasted on me, the condescending nature of such a shallow person with deaf ears even addressing me (and other former patrons) is just insulting."}
{"text":"My wife and I really like this place. Its a casual atmosphere, friendly wait staff, good food. The manager is very knowledgeable about local beers and even made me a custom beer flight. They have a big selection of local draft beers. Wings are good, burgers excellent, good deserts. I've never had a bad meal here. I've only sat in the bar area. I've been 6 or 7 times and the service and food always consistently good."}
{"text":"We had friends passing through so we meet them here. Great and easy location. Huge patio and plenty of seating. Server was awesome. Those are about the only positives to this location. The food took forever to come out and it was mediocre at best. I've had better food from different locations. I'll stick to the one in Huntersville."}
{"text":"Had a Fantastic experience here today. Food was great, place was clean and inviting, and Sam was a terrific server. She went above and beyond, made our experience that much better. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this location. We decided to get the unlimited crab. It was delicious. We also had semi- frozen crab but Chris, the manager, made sure things were made right and took great care of us. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I came in to this location after an event at a different location left me wanting more. Left me wanting more Brussel Sprouts to be specific. We ordered the Salmon Entree with Broccoli & Asparagus, Lunch Shrimp Skewers sub rice for Brussel Sprouts & the Louisiana Gumbo. The Salmon will now be my go to in the area. It was cooked perfectly on Cedar. I ordered it medium well and it was the correct temperature. The Broccoli and Asparagus tasted fresh and were lightly seasoned. Even though I ordered the Shrimp substituting the rice for Sprouts without Bacon, they gave me rice anyway. They also up charged me which I wasn't made aware of when I ordered, so that was annoying. Especially since the rice is the same price as the sprouts on the menu. So the up charge made no sense. The shrimp were overcooked and the rice didn't add much to it. But their grilled Brussel Sprouts are awesome. The Gumbo was also delicious. Nice and chunky! I'm excited to keep trying dishes here"}
{"text":"Nice patio area.... when the weather is nice.  There was a decent crowd on the patio on a Monday night.  Absolutely dead inside though.  Service was a bit confusing as we had 2 waitresses - but we were just there to drink and also eat a light dinner.  I definitely recommend the Chicken Salad Plate....  good portioned salad and seasoned chicken salad also comes with a side fruit plate that was good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for work and always had a very pleasant experience! Everything I've tried from the menu has been great from the make your own salad (yes whatever you want from fruit options to veggies to protein they'll make whatever you pick) to the tacos you can't go wrong.   The service is great and staff is always friendly.   Unexpectedly I've even been here for music bingo one night and we had a delightful evening."}
{"text":"Overall the food was average. Definitely nothing to write home to your mom about.   We arrived shortly before the dinner rush apparently. We were seated quickly but the hostess set us right next to an older gentleman who was reading. And out of all the empty tables - I didn't understand why she did that. I had a kid with a tablet. I think understanding your customer is important but whatever.   We ordered a couple of appetizers to start - the tuna poke and onion rings. Okay - for $12 I was mad about the tuna poke serving. It was legit small. Taste wise it was okay. Not a lot of seasoning.   The onion rings were okay too. (I think you'll here that about most of my food). It came with a little tiny cup of dipping sauce. We asked for another and never received it.   My son's kid meal sweet potato fries had some kind of simple syrup glaze on it. Yeah, he wouldn't eat it. I tried it and it just didn't need it. Sweet potato fries are naturally sweet - why ruin it and make them soggy and add unnecessary sugar?    I went with the honey bee sting chargrilled chicken wings with a side of broccoli. I think the plain steamed broccoli was the highlight of my meal. I had two friends tell me how amazing these wings were - yeah no. They were pretty bland.   My man ordered lemon pepper chargrilled wings and they were completely inedible. Super salty and gross. We attempted to complain to the server about it - but he brushed us off.   We waited a good 15 minutes just to get our check after we asked for it. And then our server wouldn't even get the payment. Some lady came to our table and snatched it from our table.   I could have complained to management but I was tired and annoyed and just ready to go. Definitely will not go back."}
{"text":"Hickory Tavern has been HIT or MISS over the past few years . Mostly MISS !!! Went there Saturday 3/18/2017 evening around 9:30 , not very busy at all. Shows that they must be hurting for business. Only ordered three appetizers , Chicken Quesadilla , Shred Heads and Chips and Queso .  Took about 20 Min to receive our under cooked Quesadilla and was informed at that point that they were out of shred heads , would have been nice to know that when we ordered. Waited another 5 to 10 min. for chips and Queso to come out.  Unfortunately in that area there's not much to choose from at that time of night .  So you kind of cross your fingers , say a little prayer and hope your order comes out correct. Would suggest driving a little further to the Sun Valley Area , a bit more to choose from."}
{"text":"One and Done.  Never again.  Expectations were minimal, yet still managed to dissapoint.  I thought I played it safe by getting boneless wings and fries, but that did not work out in my favor.  The wings and fries were sitting in a pond of oil.  The wings were so oily I matted them down with paper towels and the paper towels were soaked through the same way a napkin on a greasy pizza would be.  It was gross.  Service was well below average as well."}
{"text":"This location is super convenient since I live up the street.. but every single time I've been here it just isn't good. I literally order a kids grilled cheese and sweet potato fries and every time they've messed it up. I usually call and order to-go and it seems like every time I call I have to wait 10 minutes for someone to take my order. And then when I pick it up, my food is either cold, burnt or wrong. It just isn't good."}
{"text":"Service is TOP-Notch!  Thank you Samantha.  She was sweet and very attentive.  Even the managers checked in on us - customer service was of great importance. The BYO salad is awesome - they offer so many choices, you can never go wrong - and be sure to order their house dressing. My friend and I had a long leisurely lunch, with no pressure to leave, our drinks refilled with smiles the whole time. We will be back - but next time will stay for dessert too (coconut cake!)"}
{"text":"I am updating my rating due to receiving fabulous service today.  And, Guinness is available in 20 ounce pours for 7 bucks.  Seriously, after several bad experiences, the place seems to be coming around.  Food was on time and our server was on top of her game."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.   Brandy is perhaps the worst waitress I have ever encountered.  Food is average at best.  Do not bother, there are a lot of other options in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  Last 2 times the waitress disappears and never returns, no drinks, food order was wrong and we had to get the manager to stop and fix it and then we have to chase them down to pay the bill."}
{"text":"Big Screens and Bigger screens, great location and decent food. Located right off Harris Blvd @ I-77 near North Park Mall this place is a great stop for good Pub Grub. The Turkey Club is excellent and the Super Nachos are a meal for four or more. You want to go here on game day to watch the Panthers. You can enjoy the view from many Plasmas or the huge Big Screen.  They do serve Guinness but the day I went there was a problem with the tap so I had to settle for the Fat Tire....meh..."}
{"text":"Great place to go on Game day.  They have quite a few HD plasmas and one really long table where maybe 20 or more people can sit.  Lot's of booths and seats at the bar as well.  We went on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch. Not crowded at all and we had very good service.  We had the oysters for an appetizer, when i asked what kind our waitress asked 'what do you mean'. It went down hill from there. Turns out they are 'gold band' from the Gulf. They were tasteless and tiny.  The crab dip appetizer was quite good, it comes with toast points and made for a nice starter.  I had the BBQ chicken tacos, you get two and fries on the side. They were quite good and a decent size for two tacos."}
{"text":"There are several reasons why this place deserves 4 starts. They have a varied menu and everything I've ever tried has been good.  They do an especially good job with their nachos and their burgers. Several friend and family members go here frequently and they keep going back.  The staff is professional and friendly and the service is consistently good.  Their food prices are reasonable and they have regualr food & drink specials.  On Sunday, they have NFL ticket so you can see every game on big HD TV's. Great location too and during the summer you can sit outside and enjoy the patio.  This particlual evening we shared the nachos which were really good. I had the Bacon Honey BBQ Burger which was well preparted and very good."}
{"text":"Kdub has it right with the \"better food than Fox and Hound\" comment. The issue with that is the food at FnH sux so bad that it leaves tons of room to be better. That being said, better in this case is a reasonably solid 3 stars. If they would do more little things right like lose the Kraft salad dressings (hard to believe they even advertise them on the menu) and opt for some more homemade choices, it would make a positive difference.    Other than that, there are decent enough beer choices, lots of TVs and in my case, it's within longish stumbling distance home should the need arise after a late kickoff Florida State football game. :)"}
{"text":"I planned a get-together event at the Hickory Tavern Northlake for our wedding weekend on April 27, 2013. I initially wanted to have the event at the nearby Fox and the Hound, which I was very comfortable with, but the Hickory Tavern was more conveniently located next to the Hilton Garden Inn Northlake where our guests were staying.   To ease things on the restaurant, I called the Hickory Tavern Northlake about a week before and let them know I would have a big group of at least 25 people arriving shortly after 9:30PM on Friday, April 26.  About eight people from the group arrived at 9:30PM, but the majority of the group and I were a little late because our rehearsal dinner ran longer than expected. I got there around 11:00PM and the majority of the guests got there at 11:15PM.  When I arrived, I was happy to see a big space near the bar with tables that our large group of 35+ people could enjoy. As I was greeting everyone and saying hello, I thought things were great. However, I quickly became frustrated as soon as I wanted a beer and could not get any service. I waited for our server for several minutes.  I tried to go the bar to order a drink, but because I had said hello to my group of friends already at the tables, the bartender said I was not allowed to open a tab unless I was going to sit at the bar. I never got a reason on why this was the case, but it was very frustrating. I finally got my beer from the server after several more minutes. My fiancée arrived a few minutes later and we had to go through the same ordeal.    As the rest of the group arrived on the bus, the problem became extremely obvious since no one was able to get a drink. Everyone tried the same thing I did in going to the bar and each was turned away as soon as they said they were with my group. Seeing their frustration, I went to the bar to figure out a solution. They were not willing to work with me. I ended up having to express to the bar tenders that our group of 35+ people was going to have to leave and get service somewhere else if the situation did not improve. We kept talking with no progress, but eventually a manager came over. The manager assigned us several more waiters, which eased the frustration in our group. The waiters did a great job and provided adequate service, but it would have been a lot easier if the bar would have allowed service there.   As a result of my experience, I would not recommend Hickory Tavern for large happy hour or drinking type events unless everyone is planning to be seated at the bar or at one table. Unfortunately the bar only seats about 15-20 people. In general, you should not expect their bar environment to behave like a typical bar, even in the 11PM - 2AM time period (the hours that we were there). We had a perfect wedding weekend and this was really the only stress or disappointment I can recall.   I cannot comment on the quality of their food or dining.   Sincerely,  Jack Michel Jr. Charlotte, NC"}
{"text":"Stop in every Friday, always sit at the bar. Great service - Super friendly staff. Great food. Been going here for couple months now. No problems so far. Would recommend. Brad, Steph and Suzanne great bar tenders."}
{"text":"Super bar staff. Never had to wait for a refill. Location great. One star down from 5 though.  High noise level and music a bit loud. Either that or I am getting old. Good atmosphere. Recommend a visit"}
