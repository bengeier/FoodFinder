{"text":"The chocolate is amazing. I hated 'dip' cones before. This place will change your mind. The crepes are also delicious."}
{"text":"Fun, different place for ice cream and/or crepes. Not your normal ice cream joint . . . this is more sophisticated than Sonic, Baskin Robbins, etc.  The shop is tucked away in Dana Park, the decor is clean and gives off this French crepe shop vibe they are trying to create.  

Everyone in our group had dipped cones, which I highly recommend.  Here's how it works: there are about 6 or 7 flavors of ice cream you can choose from, and then another 7 or 8 types of Belgian chocolate in which you can dip the cone.  The ice cream is of the creamy, soft-serve variety.  The ice cream itself is not very sweet -- more creamy than anything -- and that's a good thing when paired with the ultra-decadent Belgian chocolate coating.  The chocolate which they use to dip the cone is truly superb.  This isn't like a DQ dipped cone where the chocolate hardens up and cracks when you bite into it.  That's cheap chocolate.  This chocolate firms up into a thick outer layer, but remains pliable and \"tears\" rather than \"cracks\" when you bite into it. My wife, who is an amateur chocolatier, tells me this is a sign of high quality chocolate.

In short, I would highly recommend this place as a different take on the traditional ice cream shop.  You can't go wrong within one of their dipped cones.  We didn't get to try the crepes, but we will probably give them a shot  sometime down the road."}
{"text":"Great place to get something to satisfy that sweet tooth of yours while at Dana park.  We had a crepe with chocolate hazelnut and strawberry purre that was amazing! You can taste the freshness for sure, we also had a chocolate ice cream cone and it was so rich and creamy. The owners were very helpful and friendly with suggestions, we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Their crepes and ice cream cones are the best! If you get a cone definitely get it dipped, you won't regret it. The chocolate they use is very high quality and very good! The owners are very friendly and welcoming. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is our go to dessert spot! The dipped cones are amazing and made with high quality chocolate. We crave them at least once a week. I love the dark sea salt.. it's a perfect mix of sweet and salty. The staff is very friendly, and the decor is adorable!"}
{"text":"Came in for or a visit with a couple toddlers, a mom friend and my mom. 
We showed up just after they opened and they were super welcoming even with 2 toddlers in tow. 
The kiddies had ice cream. A vanilla cone with sprinkles and strawberry vanilla in a bowl. As a very involved and concerned mother I had to taste test the ice cream cone and that soft serve is soooo rich and creamy!  I will def have to get the dipped ice cream cone next visit! 
The adults got crepes and hot Chocolat (it's super fancy if you leave the \"e\" off) 
I got milk caramel and I wanted to melt at the first sip.
My friend got the white Chocolat and it was equally amazing. 
With the chocolate they heat it up to warm, opposed to hot. It's like the \"kids\" temp at Starbucks.  But comparing apples to apples, this chocolate has a deeper flavor and not as sweet. I think it's because it's Belgian? Does that make everything better? Yes!
The crepes! They are to die for!! Any combo will make you smile from ear to ear!!"}
{"text":"Oh heaven on Earth, this place is where Angels must go before they get their wings!

It's beyond adorable to start off. Once you have a good look around head to the nectar of the G-ds aka the chocolate where your ice cream will enjoy their dip before you enjoy it!  There are more than one flavour and you can sample them as well! I had just enjoyed the peanut butter ice cream and the chocolate dip. If you're ever feeling bad, this place will cheer you up! (Disclaimer, if you're in the mood for this on a Sunday well, maybe DQ will do...this place is closed.)

It's worth the money and maybe you'll hear the heavens sing to you. Then again that could be me outside doing a happy dance and song!"}
{"text":"Fabulous! Rich, decadent, amazing. Highest quality ingredients. Took the whole family and everyone raved about how rich and delicious it was. We had many crepes and dipped cones. Start with the smaller sizes on your first visit as it is really rich and hard to finish. Nothing else like this around here. Stop in for date night or bring the kids and enjoy."}
{"text":"The chocolate was to die for. The prices were better than expected. And the owners were very kind. Looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Mmm Crème & Chocolats, what's not to love!! We frequent here way more than we should. At least once a week  Its an adorable, cute-sy little shabby chic farm style spot perfect for families and couples to fulfill that sweet tooth!! With outdoor seating, right next to that little water fountain, makes all that much more cute-sy romanticy  Anyway, the service is awesome, they really know how to keep up with the demand. The line goes quick and everything is made fresh right there on the spot, like your crepes and your dipped cones. Their ingredients are like seriously top notch, you can truly taste the quality- decadent and rich Belgium chocolate. With several flavors of ice cream and chocolate dipping flavors, you really can't go wrong. They have really great crepes too that are a great size and good for sharing (even thought you might not want to) they also have a \"speciality\" ice cream flavor that changes each month & is chosen by their social media followers!! My whole family loves this place and we love coming here, and we love supporting local."}
{"text":"Great service, even better desserts! 

(Just wanted to quickly mention this is all BELGIUM  CHOCOLATE which is warmed and melted in these little silver bins to absolute silky smooth results.)

I was new to this shop but had very high expectations for them which they met and exceeded. My boyfriend and I were greeted as soon as we entered. The woman behind the desk asked if we were new, most likely because of our lost look as we went over their beautifully written menu above her. She gave us the whole run down of their menu even though I've seen them mentioned a few time in instagram stories but it was nice to get their perspective.

As for the food I order a butter pecan dipped in hazelnut milk chocolate which honestly was so tasty. I wouldn't have ever been able to try this duo anywhere else because frankly, no one else has them! You can mix and match, be creative, or do the works. 

My boyfriend ordered a crepe with fresh banana, strawberries, strawberry purée, and their milk chocolate. It was so loaded you might have to eat a light dinner or share this with a few people around you!

Everything was tasty, from the nice warm crepe, to the sweet yet classic chocolate dipped cone. We sat outside in their patio and enjoyed the amazing weather the valley has every once in a blue moon. It was all perfection."}
{"text":"The chocolate for the dipped cones is amazing!! They offer so many flavors to dip and it's a thick layer.  The different combinations that can be made between the many ice cream flavors and chocolates ensures there is something for everyone. The crepes are really good too."}
{"text":"The service was great and it was delicious!! Would definitely go again. It really tastes like good quality ingredients. It was such a cute place too! #LFTHX"}
{"text":"I hate to give a review for the only purpose that as this beautifully quaint small shop becomes popular....I'll have to wait in a long long line to get this amazing chocolate! 

Super cute place- very warm inside, not a lot of seating. 

I had a pineapple sorbet coated in a thick delicious dark chocolate. We also got a crepe with blueberries and dark sea salt with strawberries. It was all so mouthwatering and delish and hit the sweet tooth. This chocolate is unlike anything I've ever had- I love chocolate. This is hands down my new favorite place. 

The menu also includes ice cream bars, ice cream and other yummy nuggets that you basically order whatever you want. Very individual. The flavors to choose are great and classic yet absolutely decadent. 

I will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place that has great tasting ice cream.  The variety of chocolates for dipping add so much flavor.  It's priced right and has friendly staff. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The setting is cute and the prices are high. The chocolate dipped ice cream had good flavor, but the dipping chocolate was too thick and some flavors are too rich."}
{"text":"Such a fun and cute place! There are so many options of soft serve flavors and chocolate dips for the cones I was honestly overwhelmed, but in a good way! The employees were very helpful and offered to let us sample the different chocolate dip flavors - I actually ended up going with an employee suggestion of raspberry soft serve with a chocolate peanut butter dip and it was delicious! The chocolate dip dried thick and helped keep the melting soft serve inside and everything tasted incredible. My husband went for classic vanilla soft serve with a cookies and cream white chocolate dip and it was also very yummy. We will definitely be back! #lfthx"}
{"text":"Loved This place! Super fun and so delicious! Their chocolate is super good and fun to watch the crepes be made!"}
{"text":"I think it's a bad thing that I live near this place cause I'm gonna gain 20lbs in a month. The soft serve here is so rich and creamy. I can't believe of how good it is. They also have flavors to compliment the ice cream and also get it dipped! I got the strawberry and cheesecake flavor and it tasted amazing. I also went twice in a day which definitely a start of a problem."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The chocolate dipped cones  I wish the ice cream was a little better than cheap soft serve but the chocolate is so great that it evens it all out. We will close by, this could be a problem!"}
{"text":"Cute place with a fancy twist on the old dipped cone.  It was exciting that they had many soft serve flavors to choose from but sad to find out the flavors were just artificial syrup twisted into vanilla.  I wanted to get the pistachio flavor but after I found out it would be syrup, I decided that might be gross and opted for the safer strawberry syrup.  I had it dipped in dark chocolate and the combo was good.  The darkness of the chocolate was exactly what I wanted but defeated the purpose of the strawberry ice cream.  The chocolate was so much stronger than the strawberry that I don't think it would matter what flavor the ice cream was.  I will just get plain vanilla next time.  The chocolate coating was ultra thick which got me initially excited but later it became a little too much and it also didnt harden into the crunchy shell I wanted. I waited a long time and it still was more chewy than crunchy.  I also wished that they gave fresh made waffle cones rather than store bought cake cones.  Perhaps you have to use the cheapy cones to dip??? but I would have liked something better for my $5.  Overall, it was decent but I am torn whether a cheap McDonald's dip cone is better or this fancy one."}
{"text":"I rated this a two out of five because it is not a very sweet crepe it's a little too chocolatey. The service is good the place is clean. But they do not know how to make a sweet crêpe I got a blueberry crêpe that was just very sour and bitter. I also got another crate that was chocolate and strawberry and I can barely taste the strawberry with in the crepe. This was not very well-balanced. The ice cream was all right nothing special or anything to write home about."}
{"text":"This place was a nice little treat. The chocolate dipped ice cream was wonderful. You can definitely tell that they use high quality chocolate. If you're a fan of chocolate dipped ice cream definitely check this place out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a friend yesterday and we fell in love! My friend mixed the chocolate and orange to make a milkshake and she LOVED it! I ordered a cone with raspberry ice cream dipped in dark chocolate. The ice cream was creamy and the swirl of flavor was the perfect amount! I've had dip top from other ice cream shops and it's usually a thin layer of chocolate. The layer of dark chocolate on my ice cream was thick and smooth. I highly recommend this place! The decor was cute and the customer service was great!!"}
{"text":"Chocolate fans will love this quaint place run by a lovely French Canadian couple. They really do dipped cones right!  Thick and delicious with Belgium chocolate in a bunch of yummy flavors. YumY Yum"}
{"text":"Been here twice already & it has been heaven! I love their crepe spread with milk hazelnut & my husband love their icecream sandwich dipped in milk hazelnut. They have lots to offer, but those two are our favorites! Cant wait for their grand opening on saturday & try their best desserts!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Tried crepes, which we watched being cooked and assembled and delicious soft serve ice cream. Definitely worth a stop for a treat!"}
{"text":"Walking into this place and I was struck by how wonderful it looked inside. Very trendy, but it had classic elements sprinkled throughout.  I ordered a black cherry dipped cone and my boyfriend got a dipped ice cream sandwhich. The cashier was very helpful, especially since my boyfriend had a hard time choosing what to get. 

The chocolate is very high quality. I recommend the dark sea salt. I only take a star off because the black cherry flavor was almost nonexistent.  I know it is swirled,  but it's not even swirled all the way through.  

#lfthx"}
{"text":"I cannot day enough good things about Crème and Chocolats! We have been three times now and every time I have been so impressed. Their ice cream is perfectly smooth, and the Belgium chocolate is to die for! Today, we got the crepe with blueberry purée, milk caramel chocolate, and strawberries. My husband, daughter and I devoured it in about two minutes. Thank you for such a quality, affordable and delicious dessert place!"}
{"text":"Had the small chocolate caramel dipped pistachio cone.  Chocolate was tasty but too overwhelming with it thick coated on not so tasty soft serve.  The pistachio flavouring was just a syrup swirled in with vanilla soft serve.  Maybe I don't know what good soft serve is, but I prefer Macdonalds."}
{"text":"I must admit, I was a bit apprehensive to give this shop my business after seeing their marketing videos and watching who I assumed was one of the owners making crepes without gloves. That's a big no-no in the food handling world. But I decided to overlook that mishap and give them a chance since I have an overwhelming desire to support every local business in hopes it will succeed. Therefore, I did my duty as a native Mesan and I went the first week it opened. I was expecting more Parisian decor than the rustic, farmhouse look I was met with, but really, nothing to harp on there. I heard some buzz that the chocolate dipped cones weren't dipped in your average chocolate and found this to be true. The dark chocolate dipping was rich and decadent and the vanilla was, well, vanilla. The cone was average. The price I payed was well-above average though, at almost five bucks a pop. I hate to say it, but I think it's a bit overpriced for what it is and haven't been back since."}
{"text":"I love chocolate and ice cream so it sounded good.  Took my family and I saw the reviews about the dipped cones having too thick of chocolate.  I love chocolate so it didn't sound like a problem to me.  I got a \"chocolate\" cone dipped in mint chocolate.  I was disappointed because it wasn't chocolate soft serve it was vanilla with a swirl of chocolate flavoring through it.  My husband doesn't care about chocolate so he got a butter pecan cone and didn't care for it either for the same reason.  But my daughters got crepes and the chocolate was off the hook good.  Like I was dying how good it was.  None of us were fans of the purée in the crepe because it made it sort of soupy, but I for sure would go again, girls night, and get a crepe with chocolate and fruit no purée.  That purée would be good on the soft serve as a topping though.  It was yummy but too thin for a crepe in my opinion.  By the time we had left I had texted 3 friends we for sure we were coming together and my husband said he wouldn't  go again (not into chocolate).  I realized I don't want to chew my ice cream so I wouldn't get a dipped cone again but I keep thinking about the chocolate and crepes a couple weeks later.  Perfect for girls night or chocolate lovers, kinda pricey to take my little kids who would be happy with Hershey's."}
{"text":"So when I saw \"dipped soft serve cone\" I was like 'big deal, I've been to dairy queen'. Let me assure you, this is not like a Dairy Queen dipped cone or even that shell stuff you buy at the grocery store (which I love). 

This is a real, rich chocolate that they dip the ice cream in. It is fabulous and delicious. I would absolutely recommend the dipped cone. It comes in different flavors, I ordered vanilla ice cream with chocolate mint dip. My husband did a dark chocolate crepe with raspberry purée and strawberry toppings. The crepe was good, pretty standard as far as dessert crepes go. I believe my total bill was about $12 for the crepe and a small dipped cone."}
{"text":"All Smiles! This spot is so good that I almost didn't want to review it because I don't want to share the chocolate! We were looking late last night for a quick treat. Stumbled across Crème & Chocolats and what a great spot. The employees were so nice and considering we popped in 5 minutes before closing, it didn't even bother them! My husband ordered the ice cream sandwich dipped in the peanut butter chocolate, our daughter ordered the pecan flavored ice cream dipped in white chocolate (which was divine), but mine was the best (in my opinion), vanilla small cone dipped in Carmel chocolate... need I say more?! We will be back, we will probably frequent so much that they will know us by name. They also have crepes, next time we're trying those!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place other on Yelp! We love crepes, but haven't been Ble to find a good creperie with quality food AND customer service. This place was on point, and the staff was fast & attentive. Plus, the chocolate dipped cones are the best I've EVER had. Such a thick bbn layer of chocolate. I've never seen such a wide variety of chocolates at a shop like this, and the options available will keep us coming back for more."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd say gross to ice cream. The chocolate dip is tasty but way too sweet and the ice cream is just basic cheap tasting with just a swirl of you flavor choice. A few bites of the chocolate dip and I was done, got a stomach ache from the over sweetness and had to throw it out. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I got the Rasberry ice cream with hazelnut dip and my wife got chocolate ice cream with chocolate dip. The ice cream is not very flavorful and a very creamy ice cream. Not much rasberry or chocolate flavor with the ice cream itself. The dips were super thick on the outside of the ice cream. For us it was too much.....and we definitely like our sweets. This place just didn't do it for us."}
{"text":"Best ice cream I've had in a very long time! I had a chocolate shake and my daughter had a cone. Creamy and smooth! Can't wait to try the crepes! Yummmmm!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love it!!!  we will be back. The best chocolate ever!  The owners are sweet and I've been here 4 times already!! Def a family favorite!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I saw they had dip cones and made a beeline here after dinner last night. Great service and we both had amazing pistachio and dark chocolate dip cones. Different soft serve flavors plus different chocolate dip flavors that will blow your mind. Dark, light, and white flavors offered. We both picked dark chocolate sea salt for ours. Great minds think alike!  They do lovely crepes, too. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Long waits for nothing special.  Don't bother with the French hot chocolate. Nothing French about it (not thick, no whipped cream) - so I asked why they call  it \"French?\" Because they make it with \"real\" chocolate (not sure what the alternative to that would be).  And they just nuke the milk so it isn't even very hot. More like chocolate milk. Big disappointment. No one who has ever had French milk chocolate would mistake this concoction for French milk chocolate."}
{"text":"Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  This was so delicious.  Both hubby and I had the sorbet bars.  So refreshing and the chocolate was so rich and indulgent.  The pineapple with milk was delicious but next time I'd try the dark with sea salt.  Our friend choose a crepe and it looked out of this world good.  This place is already so popular with lines out the door and it will continue to be because it hits dessert out of the park!  The Belgium chocolate is decadent, rich and not at all waxy.  The pineapple sorbet bar was tart and refreshing.  It's a very small shop without much table space or outdoor seating and it was tricky to get out the door with our treats when the line through the doors was so long. Hopefully they can come up with a better flow of traffic.  

If you're looking for something unique and for delicious chocolate, this is your place!  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Why aren't you here yet!? This is hands down the best ice cream shop I have been too in Arizona! This is my new favorite place and will be for some time. The ice cream is top notch, the staff were fast and very polite and the small shop still has room to move around and a nice sitting area outside for when the weather turns cooler. Do not miss out on a visit here."}
{"text":"Incredible chocolate dips! This is rich creamy chocolate - nothing like the thin coating from some other places. We got cones, 1 vanilla dipped in dark chocolate w/sea salt, and 1 vanilla pistachio swirl dipped in chocolate caramel - amazing! But then we took a sandwich dipped in chocolate peanut butter to go for dessert the next - it's enormous, so we're still snacking on it several days later."}
{"text":"Just a little disclaimer for everyone wanting to go here for some chocolate ice cream or any other flavor...... they don't have any.... they have Vanilla ice cream with a tiny swirl of chocolate, raspberry, or any flavor you choose and don't tell you this, they sell it as \"chocolate ice cream\" and then you get vanilla:(........ however the crépes are good, a little too much chocolate but they're good!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their dipped cones are the only way to go in my opinion. I've tried the dark chocolate sea salt dip and their Milk Hazelnut dip both are incredible and I can't wait to try their other flavors!

The best thing about the dipped cones is waiting for the chocolate to harden just a little bit and then taking a bite. You don't get some cheap crunchy shell of chocolate that falls all over the place (like you do at some other ice cream shops)! No! You get a DELICIOUS soft-melt-in-your-mouth bite of chocolate and creamy ice cream!

You definitely can't go wrong with their ice cream and dips."}
{"text":"Adorable little shop! Ice cream is the creamiest I've ever tasted and chocolate was amazing. Your sweet tooth with definitely be satisfied!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim to get away from school and it was a perfect destressing treat. Got a small cheesecake flavor cone dipped in dark chocolate sea salt and it was great! The chocolate dip is thick and is what makes the cone! Don't skip out on the dipped cone!!! They had a decent amount of soft serve flavors and different chocolate dips as well, so have fun coming up with creative combos! They also have crapes but that shall have to wait til next time!"}
{"text":"High quality chocolate, super creamy soft serve! I really enjoyed the dipped cone. I had mine streaked with strawberry and dipped in milk chocolate caramel. Was so good. The milkshake was ok but I'd stick with the dipped cones. I'm going to try the sorbet bars in chocolate too."}
{"text":"Awesome ice cream! Quality chocolate. Great customer service. Would take friends there."}
{"text":"Dragged my little family to try this place since the pictures on Instagram look so good

First impression: When we walked in, there was an overwhelming egg smell like someone ate an egg and farted when walking in the place. My husband said it could be the crepe but it def killed the vibe for me 

Icecream: I got a med vanilla dipped in white lemon chocolate, husband got vanilla dipped in cookies n creme. If you have a sweet tooth, you will enjoy this. I feel like the chocolate dip was wayyyy too sweet for me so I might not get mine dipped next time and try their flavored icecream instead. M

Customer service: one lady who dipped and served us icecream was super nice and sweet. The lady who took our orders .. not so much. She just had friends come by so when we came in, truly felt like we were inconveniencing her. Didn't feel welcomed. 

Verdict: the ice-cream is pretty but first impression is everything so it might be a while until we try this place again."}
{"text":"I got the dark a chocolate and strawberries. Delicious!!! Finally a place in mesa to sit and enjoy a dessert that is not the regular dessert. 
I am totally coming back to try the rest."}
{"text":"The owners are friendly and helpful in explaining the story behind the place and what the menu has to offer. It's a cute place with plenty of seating inside and outside. There are 9 homemade Belgium Chocolate flavors to pick from and 9 soft ice cream flavors. 

Milk Hazel reminds me of Nutella!
Milk Peanut Butter pairs great in the crepe with Strawberry puree and bananas or Raspberry and bananas (like PB&J sandwiches).
We tried the vanilla soft ice cream and it was rich and creamy.
The whipped cream on the side of the crepe is thick and yummy.
The crepes were very tasty and big!

All in all we are glad we have this option for a dessert stop nearby.

Support local small businesses. Family owned and operated. Great new dessert place in Dana Park!"}
{"text":"Satisfy your sweet tooth here, don't look any further!

I've had 4 different crepes, cones, and hot chocolate, all of them were amazing. The smooth and rich Belgium Chocolates are the base of all of their menu items and they're warmed to perfection! Great for a date night or small groups! The owners are fantastic people too!"}
{"text":"What did I just find?!! Yummy ! I ordered a small 
Peanut butter dipped cone and it was sooo good!!
The place is kinda hidden but worth the search . It's a cute quaint place . Great seating a nice water fountain outside . My only complaint is I didn't order a large!! I will definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing! The service was great and their crepes were even better. I plan to go back to try their ice cream soon. 

Pretty sure this place is run by true French! The cashier and other employees all had a beautiful French accents. I ordered their crepe with milk chocolate, strawberry purée  and bananas with their homemade whip cream ($8). It was sooo delicious. They probably have some of the best chocolate I've ever tasted in the US. 

If you have a sweet tooth, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The vanilla soft serve ice cream has flavor!! It was really good. Even my 9 year old son commented on how good it tasted. I got my cone dipped in chocolate hazelnut and it was really tasty. Their chocolate dip also doesn't cause the ice cream to get melted, which I appreciated. They had a good variety of flavors too. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"One word: outstanding! The ice cream has right taste and doesn't melt instantly in your hand. The chocolate dipped feature creates even sweeter experience! Quality ingredients, execution and service are not lacking here. I found myself thinking about the next time I would able to visit here again."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with a friend of mine. She got the fondue and I got a strawberry banana milk chocolate crepe with a side of black cherry soft serve. The ice cream was amazing. The crepe was a great too!! The only thing I didn't like was there was waaaay to much chocolate in the crepe and it was so rich I couldn't finish it. Overall we will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is good but not great. 
Way too much chocolate gets put on everything that they dip into it.
The treats are good and its in a very nice area and the staff is very friendly so its worth a try if you really like chocolate."}
{"text":"WOW! I absolutely LOVE this place! The shop is cute and the service was great, all of the staff was so friendly. It's a little far from my house but I've already gone twice in the past two weeks. It's fun to watch them make the crepes and dip the ice cream while you wait. I have been recommending people here constantly because I am so impressed with how tasty the ice cream is! The dipped cones might be the best I have had because of the Belgian chocolate. My only complaint (which is because I am picky) is that I wish they had more cone options. I would love for them to start having waffle or sugar cones instead of just cake cones. Other than that, this place is perfect and I am excited to continue to come back and try more flavors of chocolate!"}
{"text":"This location has been through its share of ice cream shops! But I'm really hoping this one sticks!! It's charming, fun & unique! And Dana Park desperately needs hot dessert spot.

Initially I was overwhelmed by the menu, but After this week cashier explained it to us it made perfect sense. Pretty much you can take an ice cream sandwich, a fruit bar or an ice cream cone with a large variety of flavors and dip it into a huge array of chocolate! Or you can order up fondue or have a specially made crêpe! Genius!!! And for a cool winter night the place was hopping!! 

We went with friends & all loved what we ordered! I got the pineapple fruit bar dipped in chocolate. It was to die for! I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of a kind and the treats are great!  I got a crepe and was delighted with the flavor. It was a super fun place and the staff is very friendly and patient.  We have several young kids and they were very happy to serve us with our wild kids. 
It's in a great spot at Dana Park too since it's right by the big fountain. It's fun to eat your treat and watch kids and their parents as the kids try to get in the water."}
{"text":"This is a great dessert place ... we love the d dip for the ice cream coatings very thick which is nice ... crepes great you can built it ur own ! ... ice cream has different nice flavor :)"}
{"text":"This is the place to go to indulge your sweet tooth and chocolate craving. We tried the chocolate dipped cones and they were SO good!!  I had butter pecan soft serve dipped in dark sea salt. Yummy!! The kids love milk caramel with sprinkles. Small was the perfect amount for us.  Beautiful and quiet atmosphere inside. We loved it!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time with a friend earlier today, and we were both so impressed! This place offers a fantastic variety of ice cream flavors, toppings, etc., and all for a reasonable price, too. The serving sizes were generous, and the quality of the food was great, too; despite the hot weather, my dipped cone stayed perfectly firm and cold, and my friend's crepe didn't get soggy at all even with an ice cream add-on. I like how small and quaint the establishment is, and the fact that it's open til late makes it ideal for an after-work splurge. I'll definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"I was really expecting to be blown away. I was a little disappointed. The crepes were $7.85. I just got back from Paris, and crepes are like 4 euros. Super overpriced in my opinion. $5 should be the max on those. I ended up getting a butter pecan ice cream cone dipped in chocolate caramel. I couldn't finish it because it was so sweet. I love sweet things so I was surprised. Cute store though."}
{"text":"Oh man...wow...what can I say...guilty pleasure! 2 of my favorite childhood treats wrapped into 1 bundle of deliciousness. Flavor swirled soft serve dipped in your choice of thick and decadent artisan magic chocolate. I had the butter pecan swirl with hazelnut shell. It was absolute bliss and worth every calorie. 

One downfall is that the water they had there on the day we went was hot tap water...so make sure to take your own bottled stuff...it's rich as can be."}
{"text":"Delicious! We went there to try out their goods after we read an article about the shop online. We had a crepe, and two dipped cones. Everything was really good--the chocolate is of great quality for sure, but we also thought the ice cream was good on its own too."}
{"text":"An amazing little after dinner spot! We weren't expecting such an amazing experience when we stopped for some ice cream. This is not your average Dairy Queen dipped cone.  You'll never go back to DQ after you get a taste of the chocolate these are dipped in. And it's a thick, rich layer, too! 
I already can't wait to go back and try more combinations and the crepes! They even have a dairy free sorbet, if you can't do the dairy thing. 
It's well worth checking out and I would love to see this place grow!"}
{"text":"Workers were extremely nice upon arrival and explained to us the options for everything. The ice cream is soft serve and served on a cake cone. The chocolate dip layer is so thick! I didn't expect much flavor when they explained that the ice cream itself is all vanilla with the other flavor is sort of drizzled around, but it still had a lot of flavor from my butter pecan option I chose. I was delightfully impressed. I need to come back to try their crepes and their sorbet bars"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Such a cute shop and great ambiance! The crepes are delicious and their milk peanut butter chocolate is to die for!! It's better than Nutella! There are so many unique ice cream flavors and dipping cone options!! You will happy with anything you get"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night for dessert and it was super busy! A line was way out the door by the time we left. Super cute little shop with limited seating. Love the decor. Cashier was very friendly and helpful. You can choose different types or soft serve ice cream, popsicles or ice cream sandwiches to be dipped in a great selection of chocolate. They also have fondue.  I ordered the ice cream sandwich dipped in milk chocolate caramel, and omg it was to die for.  I've been craving a really great dessert for weeks and this truly hit the spot. My husband ordered a butter pecan cone dipped in salted dark chocolate and it was fabulous as well.  We will definitely be back when the next chocolate craving hits."}

{"text":"This place is amazing. We have been waiting for something like this to open for years in the East Valley.  The crepes, rich belgian chocolate and classy decor will transport you to a small cafe in Europe. The dark sea salt chocolate is out of this world, and the cute French-speaking couple who own it round out the experience."}
{"text":"I really didn't think this place was anything special. I wanted to love it soooo bad but we were so disappointed!! Literally just an overpriced McDonalds cone with some flavoring on the outside. We didn't try the crepe so I can't say anything about those but the soft serve was a major disappointment. The place itself is decorated so cute and the owners are super nice but the cones were not worth what they are charging."}
{"text":"This place is really delicious! I tried the vanilla cone dipped in milk hazelnut and had a bit of my husbands vanilla cone dipped in cookies and creme. Both were great! The chocolate melts in your mouth and is very rich and yummy. Next time, I want to try the crepes!"}
{"text":"Wow! Definitely better than any other Ice Cream chain store. It's a little off the path, but well worth the trip. Just remember, they're closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Amazing. Date night, family dessert after dinner, evening cravings... this spot has it all. Crepes are generously sized so you get what you pay for. Anything dipped in chocolate is a great choice. I got the Carmel chocolate on my crepe and it was probably the smoothest chocolate I've ever had. Sooo yummy. And the service couldn't be better."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out today for the first time. I had a chocolate ice cream cone dipped in dark mint chocolate  It was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Don't miss this place for your sweet tooth. The crepes and soft ice cream are to die for. The owners are Jean and his wife are super friendly and welcoming. Located in the Dana Park shopping center off highway 60 and Val vista. I made the drive from Scottsdale and it was well worth it. Wishing you much success!"}
{"text":"This place is insane decadence!  We had just come from dinner and walked over to Creme & Chocolats expecting just a little more than DQ.  We were most surprised when we orfered our flavours of soft serve and the dip chocolat.  WOW it was the dense creamy texture of delicious chocolat from Belgium and this magnificent soft serve ice creme (gelato-like).  Absolutely delicious!  The little place is tucked in a comfortably in a corner and had a steady steam of smiling customers and has inside as well as outside seating. Its very clean.  The staff is super friendly and helpful. This was our first time here, but guaranteed not our last!  If you want a wonderful dessert after dinner or a tasty treat anytime of day,  this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Belgium chocolate dipped ice cream is fabulous, and the crepes were amazing. However, the dark mint hot chocolate is my favorite. The owners are so friendly and kind. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for a crepe or dipped ice cream. You can choose from many  options of chocolate flavors: 
 milk  milk hazelnut  milk caramel  milk peanut butter  dark  dark sea salt  white  cookies & cream  and many options of soft ice cream flavor. You need to come and try it with your best friends and family. It's your choice !!"}
{"text":"#1 The owners are there all the time and they are very friendly and welcoming. Clearly they have a passion for what they do.
#2 The decor is really fun.
#3 The Belgian chocolate lives up to the hype.

All of this said, some thoughts:
\"soft serve\" and \"premium\" or \"super premium\" are not descriptive terms for ice cream that get mixed up or randomly combined. There are actual definitions to describe each as different. There isn't such a thing as super premium (ultra high butterfat and very low overrun) soft serve. You're only getting this if you are touring a dairy and you get lucky to try a sample before the product is flash frozen hard as a rock.

So, know what you are getting when you order it. And, then be happy. No, this is not the same thing as soft serve from any number of fast food burger chains! If your pallet can't tell the difference between 3% milk fat \"frozen dairy dessert\" and 10% or high overrun (loads of air) and less overrun, then let your wallet be your guide. The cone at the Arches is as cheap as it is because the food cost/product quality is cheap to match.

The whole concept here is to get soft serve, sorbet or a crepe as the foundation for the Belgian chocolate. The chocolate is truly a star.

Is it inexpensive? No. \"Belgian\" chocolate. Made to order crepes. Fresh fruit. Really enough said.

Is it rich and decadent? Yes! That is kind of the point.

I've tried the crepe and found it to be light and flavorful. A great foundation to fresh fruit and a sinful dollop of dark chocolate. I've also tried the strawberry sorbet. Again, dipped in dark chocolate. The sorbet was quite good and had a balance between pulp and juice.

I will agree that it was a bit difficult to eat the sorbet popsicle. The stick was inside the sorbet well enough to keep that part together. But, the little end left to hold on to was a bit on the short side. I did find that the chocolate did harden after about one minute. Waiting the minute to dive in was a challenge! I'm grateful that the chocolate didn't shatter into little bits and fall off as I was enjoying my treat. Maybe next time I'll ask for a plate so I'm safe to take a bit longer to let the flavors linger vs. being afraid the whole thing would either melt or fall to the floor before I could yum it all down.

Come here for a fun date-night treat or a family fun afternoon. Linger. Enjoy the experience. I think doing so adds value to this wonderful treat."}
{"text":"I had the dark chocolate dipped cone, and it was very good.  I think I would like the milk chocolate better, so I will have to go back sometime!  Cute store, friendly employees.  It was busy, but they were efficient with the line.  I want to go back, but I am kind of glad that it is a bit of a drive from my house.  It could become a problem.  Lol!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Crème & Chocolats is a fun dessert shop in Dana Park. It is a dream come true for anyone with a sweet tooth. Their most popular item is their chocolate dipped cone. You can choose the flavor of chocolate your cone is dipped into and there are so many yummy flavors available. They also have crepes which are really good too, but my favorite is a vanilla ice cream cone dipped into their peanut butter milk chocolate. A little tip is to wait for the chocolate to harden before eating the cone. I definitely recommend trying it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"We spent $13 on three cones and my husband and I threw ours away. Chocolate was too thick and rich and ice cream was super thick and tasted so weird. Won't be going back. Super disappointed. Maybe their crepes are better."}
{"text":"The chocolate dip is good but too sweet especially when it's a thick layer of it. Something that rich should be enjoyed in small amounts. The ice cream is okay... the flavor you choose are flavor swirls in vanilla ice cream which was nothing special."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but it just wasn't for me. My party was about half and half... the chocolate coating is thick and doesn't harden all the way, I'm more of a traditional dipped cone girl. The chocolate flavor was great though. The ice cream was pretty mediocre but the service was excellent. I would go back if a friend wanted to go, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Adorable little shop in Dana Park. My mom and I both got crepes with mango purée and strawberries. I got the sea salt dark chocolate and Mom got regular dark. We both thought our crepes were divine. My daughter got a chocolate swirl cone dipped in cookies and cream chocolate. I didn't think I'd care for it but it was surprisingly good! We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"This is the only crepe place i have been to in Arizona and i was not disappointed. Everything is made in front of you and tastes very good!"}
{"text":"Best Ice Cream I've ever had! Excellent customer service and super cute atmosphere! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite after dinner spot! Cute, clean and delicious. They also offer a loyalty stamp card."}
