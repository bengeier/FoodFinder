{"text":"I try to avoid chains like this.  but if i have to, panera not only has a kick ass broccoli and cheese soup in a bread bowl to warm you on a cold wintery Cleveland day..but I discovered the greatest summer dish there (which i instantly went home and recreated the following day)...their strawberry poppyseed salad.  strawberries, blueberries, mandarin oranges, pineapples, lettuce, cucumbers (i think), walnuts, and poppyseed dressing.  oh, and their's comes with chicken, but i'm not about that part.
anyways, go try this salad.  it makes you forget you're givin' your money to The Man.
(three stars because..well, when you're done eating you remember you just bought into a huge franchise.)
man i'm a dumbass."}
{"text":"Panera is a decent sandwich chain, but it's overpriced.  This particular Panera in no way stands out as better or worse than any other.  It is a very convenient location for many downtown office workers."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this Panera often. It is large, and very comfy. The greek salad with soup. My favorite soups are the lentil and the chicken noodle, both are low fat and sooo good!"}
