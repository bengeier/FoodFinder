{"text":"This place is awesome ! Value for money....  they recently have a new management and the product and service is great.   Worth giving a shot."}
{"text":"Dirty joint nothing work no belly card no cold pop dirty dead flies in Windows  no American workers  no support for the community  this is the worst georgio's Pizza I went to. No oven for the fresh and ready Pizza  they just sitting outside the oven"}
{"text":"Ordered over $40 worth of delivery one Monday (slow day right?). Pizzas arrived and were made terribly (even for georgio's). Owner refused to speak to me over phone and after waiting to speak to him about the poor quality of the food, he just offered a free \"hot n ready pizza\" at some other time. Also,  there is an unfriendly woman working behind counter. Delivery driver however was nice and fast.

ATTN: Georgio's on Emery Rd.  You have way too much competition to run a business this way guys. Not going back."}
