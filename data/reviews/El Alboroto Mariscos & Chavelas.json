{"text":"Delicious hidden spot found thanks to yelp. Molcajete alboroto style such great flavor!!! Their Chavelas aka Micheladas on point !!! Fish tacos and camarones a la diabla so tasty!!!Would've given them a 5 however we had to wait about 30 min for fish no problem I was in good company with the family so really didn't mind the wait."}
{"text":"The service was poor.food was cold and greasy,this could be a good potential place too eat but they need to get real people to served customers.and no toilet paper in the bathroom"}
{"text":"My son brought me here for lunch and this place is amazing I had the tostada Alboroto and I brought home a civiche tostada for my hubby and he's said it was great. They made a special plate for my son who doesn't care for shrimp carne asada fries."}
{"text":"This probably the best Authentic Mexican Seafood Restaurant in the Valley. I had the Caldo 7 Mares and was perfectly prepared. My Dad had the Coctel de Camaron con Pulpo which he said it was the best he's had in a long time. My wife had the Camarones a la Diabla, they were very good... I personally expected a ln extremely spicy hot dish, but this was mild in spice with excellent flavor. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I order a shrimp cocktail it was ok ,but the fish tacos were flavor less and my wife order a garlic shrimp plate it was flavor less too ,and they don't sell beer and I like my sea food with beer I don't think I'm going back"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, slow. Ordered fries al alboroto, they were delicious!  Had shrimp ceviche tostadas, they were just ok.  Campechana was a just ok too   Probably won't go back"}

{"text":"Literally standing here 10 mins without anyone acknowledging if we can be seated or on a wait list. I then approach an employee and she says will be right with you. Another 10 mins has gone by and I'm about to leave. Horrible service. Very very disorganized."}
{"text":"This \"dive\" has only been open a few weeks. The inside could use a face lift but that's not really why we are there. Although we had to wait a few minutes to be seated, the server was friendly and happy to see us. Most of the tables needed to be cleared off, from what looked like a \"rush\" that had occurred. On the table there was at least eight different types of salsa in bottles. We were also given their salsa in a bowl served with tostada shells, which by the way, were tasty. The orchata was most satisfying and the jamaica was also good. I ordered the medium size shrimp cocktail, and it was more than I needed. Fresh shrimp and chopped fresh onions and cucumber. Very good! My husband had the spicy shrimp meal that came with rice and a salad. All very delicious and so different.  Beer is not sold; you bring your own."}
{"text":"First time here and enjoyed the atmosphere. The food was great, the beer was ice cold.   I tried some Camarones a la Diabla and they were delicious. More onions than shrimp but still great. I don't really care about the \"salad\" (lettuce) but I would rather have more rice instead of that. I'm not a fan of peas in my rice but what am I going to do.  I guess the main reason I enjoyed my visit was because of my cold beers.  The lady who attended me came by once to ask if I needed something but for next time I'll ask for someone else.  I will come back to try out the Coctel de Camar√≥n and Tostadas."}
{"text":"This place was so good. We were craving some maricos so wanted to give this place a try. I was so glad we tried this place out. Everything was very good and they were generous on the portions as well. Food took a little while to get out but we were so glad we waited. Like they always say you can't rush perfection .  I will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Hits the spot when you want that authentic Mexican Mariscos taste. The wait staff was welcoming and friendly. If you want to sit down and enjoy your food this is the place. (In a rush?  Not for you.) Molcajete Alborotado is huge!! It has the right amount of spice and almost every seafood under the sea. Great menu selection of cold and hot seafood plates cooked in different Mexican styles. Table salsa is chunky and delicious, none of that watered down runny stuff other's try to pass as salsa. Can't wait to return and try a different menu item."}
{"text":"Today I thought I would try something different I ordered the shrimp soup shrimp were so small, I then asked the waiter for a side of rice took her about 30 mins to  bring it out, the tortillas were stale. I'm kinda disappointed aswell because they take forever to bring your food out.  And there's no waiters in sight it's like they good hide in the kitchen!!"}
{"text":"You guys are my new favorite for Seafood.   Good, Serious food is hard to find on the West Side and you guys killed it.   But I saw those people. You remember the ones. The ones that walked out.   The ones that walked in expecting you to be like every Mexican restaurant.   Every other Del Taco, Taco Bell, Filibertos or Mariscos in the valley.    People with unimaginative taste that Expect rice & and beans to accompany any plate, because they stereotype.   People without an innovative bone in their body. Those people will never see you.   But don't.   Don't.   Don't let them.   The mindless sea of corporate slaves that only want homogenized food squeezed into their mouths from a tube.   Don't let them get to you.   Your food is good. Damn good.   Don't change. Keep doing what you're doing. Let the food speak for you."}
{"text":"While looking for a place where there was good sea food, the first thing that came to mind was the Crab shack because its closer to home and because they sell good seafood, but I stumble upon this place. Good thing I stopped and gave it a try, food was delicious and the service is understandable. The only one thing is that I like My micheladas to be made with Tecate beer and they had ran out of them, but other than that I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went here for a group event and I think this place was more busy on a Tuesday night that it may have ever been... not too easy to find from the road FYI. The wait staff was friendly, but I think they were a little under-staffed for the evening with our group so it was a little slow but nothing too bad. I was impressed with the size of the fish taco, 2 is plenty for most. The fish was a good size and nicely fried. The chopped slaw and tomato topped with their special sauce was very good. No ice tea (boo), seems like a pretty basic drink request. All beer is in bottles too, no draft options. It was okay."}
{"text":"Mexican Style Seafood Restaurant***************On the West Side  Located in not the prettiest part of Peoria in not the newest looking strip mall is a El Alboroto Mariscos Y Chavelas. At the time of this review the restaurant is hard to find because the sign above the restaurant reads AZ Kitchen Mexican Food.  I do warn you that you are not coming here for atmosphere because the entrance seems very unfinished. You pass by an deserted hostess stand a bar and piles of chairs and then make your way to the dining room. This isn't a fancy place and you are only here for the food.  Not all but the majority of the menu is mostly shrimp, octopus or fish.  They started us off with fried corn tortillas, lots of limes and a house made salsa that was very unique with tomato sweetness. The tables are filled with many Mexican Bottled Sauces.  They started us off with fried Fish tacos that were fresh tasting and tasty with a creamy spiced sauce. They were similar to tacos I had in Mexico.  Soon the entrees arrived and that is what blown us away. I had the Pescado Empapelado - Wrapped Fish ($11.95) where the fish is cooked with peppers, onions and seasoning in it's own juices. They didn't give me a muddy fish like tilapia or catfish and used a better tasting sea bass. This fish was SO FRESH TASTING and prepared to PERFECTION. It was such a joy to eat. I really think it the best fish I had from any of the Mexican Restaurants in the Metro Phoenix area. It seemed fresher and was a better tasting fish prepared more perfect. My dish came with seasoned rice and a salad garnish that included sliced ripe avocado. This dish was just like a fish dish I had from a seafood restaurant in Mexico. The entrees also came with HOT STEAMY tortillas.  My husband had the Camaron A La Diablo - Spicy Shrimp. Very Good, spicy but not too spicy with other lingering flavors. Shrimp were cooked nicely. The plate was set up the same as mine.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The owner Jose was very friendly and welcoming.   Very Good Seafood, low prices, rough atmosphere.   Rough Gem!  Go HERE for the fish and you'll be hooked!  7-17 slight update  Still good...a little different.   Seems like they have a different chef this time."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp ceviche which compared to many other places in the valley this o e was good cus it wasn't  overwhelmed with the veggies you actually got shrimp. Also had a shrimp and octopus cocktail which was also completely full of both. Service could use a lil help but all in all good"}
{"text":"Great Mexican seafood!  Had the fish ceviche it was really good. Spicy salsa was good that they bring to the table. Entrees were shrimp costa azul (shrimp wrapped in bacon) wonderful! And pescado ranchero was out of this world!  We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Great Gem!! Awesome shrimp cocktail. I go with the daughter and she loves the oysters on the half shell and the ceviche. Top it off with a couple of  Michelada's , it's all yummy goodness. The thing we do love the best is that there isn't a live band. Other places cram a loud band (or DJ)  in a small space, it's just too loud. El Alboroto has festive music at a nice sound level, you can have a conversation with your lunch partner while enjoying your YUMMY lunch. Great place if you have a large party/family.  I love the independant little \"hole in the wall\" places....They are the BEST!!"}
{"text":"Great beer but the tostada was not so great. I wouldn't recommend this place nor would I come back. It's kinda over priced as well."}
{"text":"Me and my friends were there friday. After waiting for one and half hour for our food  we decided to pay for the drinks and leave.  Food looked good but didn't get to try it. Honestly don't think ill be back. On the other note they charged 35 dls for 2 waters and 2 clamatos. If i was the owner I'll come to the table and apologize, don't worry about the drinks sorry for the delay but hope to see you back when we are all set with staff."}
{"text":"La comida est√° deliciosa y los precios razonables, yo soy de M√©xico y el sabor del marisco all√° lo pueden sentir fresco, del mar a su paladar, y en este restaurante se puede sentir el sabor aut√©ntico de la frescura del marisco. Mejor sea food restaurante que he visitado aqu√≠ en Phoenix, les recomiendo las tostadas de ceviche y la tostada alboroto."}
{"text":"Place is kind of hidden, looks like it's in an abandoned lot. Food was good or maybe we were just starving, after waiting almost 2 hrs to get our food. Service was horrible! So bad I actually took the time to write a review..."}
{"text":"Family and I decided to try this place. Not your tipical Sinaloa Mexican seafood. They need more seasoning in the food however they have about 8 different bottles of salsa on each table I created my own seasonings. We had fried tilapia, shrimp ceviche and fish taco my little one was sad he hated the food not kid friendly they need a kids menu! The waiter/server was a little awkward. The place was wierd it has an old sighn from the previous restaurant wtf? They need to liven it up! The place has potential. Would go back in a few weeks to try again."}
{"text":"Food not good, no dessert,  waitress not to polite  1st n last time my family n I go there. It was a party of 13 people none of us were pleased."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic hole in the wall place to get great food. Awesome ceviche and the spicy shrimp taco is no joke!!  Definitely order if you're ready to sweat. Loved everything they have great beans and rice too. It wasn't very busy when we went but who cares when the food is worth it!!"}
{"text":"Bathroom out of service in a restaurant is a big NO..!!!!   Las todastada alboroto sabia mas a salsa de soya q a mariscos solo con tres camarones aguachile en total   Los tacos gobernador superquemada la verdura con los camarones contados igual y mega grasosos y no tenian la salsa especial x ningun lado.."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying it was delish!! The customer service was impecable. As a sea food lover I really recommend El Alboroto Restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was soooo good!!!! I had the camarones a la diabla and they were really spicy which I loved, my friends got ceviche tostadas and camarones rancheros and they loved their food too, the service was great as well. We are definitely coming back"}
{"text":"First time here... food was good it did take a long while for our food to come out.  The food was good the lines could've been more squeezable my shrimp cocktail was hard to eat.  There was only one waiter It almost seemed as he was cooking the food as well.  Would come back hopefully would be served sooner.  Waiter was nice."}
{"text":"I appreciate a good fish taco and they have em! Shrimp Cocktails Are extremely flavorful, and you can't leave without trying some homemade beans! We come here often and I'm never let down!  The Spanish music sets the vibe and just gets you ready to have some great food with family and friends. Also if your in the mood to have a few, get a bucket of coronitas!"}
{"text":"I was in desperate need of some aguachile. Since my usual go-to was out of aguachile for the night, I decided to give this place a try. I have to say, I was not overly impressed. The shrimp were flavorful enough, there just weren't enough for the $18 price tag. I'll stick to my go-to moving forward."}
{"text":"Had levanta muertos  need fresh fish maybe ? Smelled way too much of seafood. Usually thats a sign its not fresh. Just went down a  Campechana's r the shit though. No fish in that"}
{"text":"First let me tell you that the building does not have an restaurant name sign on it. Look for the name on the window. It's kind of easy to miss.   Alright, this was our first time here, so I don't know if the staff is new, but she was very forgetful about simple things like brining silverware.    The decor was an interesting mix of beach motif meets the desert.   Lighting was somewhat dim, but that was welcomed after a hectic day.   The music was like murder to my ears. Every song had the same tempo, same horn lines, same melody almost. Change it up a little please.   The food was good. The whole fried fish was perfectly fried. The one shrimp taco was greasy but had good flavor once I added the cabbage and salsa to it. The small shrimp cocktail was like the ones I have had in Mexico. The flavors were there except that it was missing the  cilantro (but I'm not from this side of the country so, maybe they just don't add cilantro to their cocktails). It was good without it too.   I tried all the bottled salsas on the table with the chips they bring out to the table before the meal. The two habanero ones are not for the faint of heart. All the others were not very spicy.   I'd come back again, but I'd ask for a different waitress and I'd ask how many tacos come to the order and order at least two. Hopefully by the time I come back to the area they'll have some different songs in their playlist."}
