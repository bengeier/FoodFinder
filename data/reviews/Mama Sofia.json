{"text":"This is for the PIERREFONDS location, or at least, the 2nd location at 4913 Boulevard Saint-Charles (zip is H9H3E4).   My wife heard about this place in the newspaper and decided to give it a shot. The basic concept is that they prepare from raw ingr√©dients your pizza and you go to pick it up, uncooked, to be baked at your own home in your own oven (don't worry, easy to follow instructions on how to do so are included with every pizza ordered). By selling uncooked food, they can also avoid charging you sales taxes, which makes this one of the least expensive pizza places you can find.  Add to this how absolutely delicious their various pizzas are. So far every single one we have sampled has been nothing short but delicious, and makes for great leftovers (it is in fact the best leftover pizza my wife and I have ever tasted).   Opening hours are a bit off which is why we do not order & pick up as often as we do - we live on the other side of the island, run our errands very early in the mornings, so when the place opens up at 2pm on Sundays (noon on Saturdays and 3pm most weekdays) we often are finished and are on our way back home. However if we happen to be somewhat moderately nearby while they are opened, we try never to miss the opportunity to order there, for it really is one of those places we find answers our particularly unique pizza preferences.  There are a few chairs and tables for you to wait in case your order isn't ready when you come to pick it up but since the food is uncooked, you can't really eat there. The staff id generally very polite and real, and very pleasant to chat ever so quickly with while picking up your favorite dough pie.  They not only offer an ecclectic range of different pizzas, but also are open to your own customizations, and also offer some other dishes also to be picked up and cooked.   I don't know about the NDG location but the one on St-Charles is a very wonderful remote little secret which manages to attract us on a semi-regular basis due to their unique offers. Plus any store that raffles off a free pizza every month deserves to get your business!"}
{"text":"Fun concept for a pizza place - go on in, order what you'd like (they have a ton of different pizzas or you can design your own), bring it home and bake it.    It comes in the baking dish and is only 10 minutes to bake. Since every pizza is made to order, it's FRESH! They are open from 3 pm - 8 pm.    You can also order online. Lovely girl working there, I'll go back anytime  :-)"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Wanted to try this place to test out this concept of picking up an uncooked pizza to bake it yourself. We got a medium chicken and a medium vegetarian deluxe pizza, which we ordered ahead of time.   We were supposed to bake them for 10-12 mins at 475F but we left them in for 15mins. The difficulty here is that the veggie pizza takes a little longer and is slightly soggy from all the veg but yummy in flavour (love the oregano), while the chicken pizza doesn't need as long. Despite the charred crust, the chicken pizza was amazing and by far our fave.   I would reorder the chicken pizza and will probably go back to try the Mexican pizza or Spanaco that both sound great."}
{"text":"This pizza is the best in NDG as far as I can tell - In my top 2 or 3 in all of Montreal and beyond as well. So fresh, ingredients are on-point, and personally, i can walk there! 10/10 would hit"}
{"text":"Tucked away on Sherbrooke in West NDG, Mama Sofia is a regular treat for our family:  the concept is \"we make it, you bake it\" pizza.  They've a delicious selection of vegetarian, meat, 'build your own', and even some dessert options, priced very reasonably.   At least once a month we phone in our order, pick it up, walk it home, pop it in for 15 mins and then enjoy a piping hot pizza fresh from our oven!  The 'build your own' option is fun:  you can select regular or thin crust, in regular white or whole wheat, and they have 5 sauces to choose from, as well as a large variety of toppings.   Two of our faves:  Mama Mariya: Olive Oil,Garlic Powder, Mushrooms, Mozzarella, Bacon, Roasted Red Peppers and Feta  Grilled Vegetable: Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Grilled Zucchini, Grilled Eggplant, Roasted Red Peppers, Caramelized Onions, Parmesan and Oregano"}
