{"text":"I've been waiting for 45 minutes for a pizza that is supposed to be the special tonight the nightlife is an older crowd and I have seen bartenders giving out who drinks to people who seem to be regulars without adding them to a computer. I'm not blind I'm in town for business and I'm sitting by myself watching this all happen before my eyes."}
{"text":"Waitresses work together, I've had 3 different waitresses ask me if there's anything I need. Top shelf. Great patio and excellent service. Shout out to Jillian, say hello and tell her I sent you!"}
{"text":"As I travel a ton for work I like to find places w/ good beer.  They had 2 IPA's on tap.  How can you go wrong w/ that.  the food was typical bar food nothing great.  Staying at the Sheraton it was a nice easy walk.  Would go again."}
{"text":"Great deals , lively atmosphere , good food , I would recommend the sauerkraut balls and the nachos , which were okay. It may look old on the outside but it's a great place overall , oh and did I mention you can watch the baseball game right from your table on tv?"}
{"text":"Gave them 4 stars because it's usually pretty solid food. Got my lazy Sunday ass off my couch just to go get some chicken wings. They were out of chicken wings at 7pm on a Sunday night. How exactly does that happen? Poor inventory control. I'll be back for sure but if they don't have wings again I'll probably go back a 3rd time and then that's it!"}
{"text":"If you're searching for decent bar/grille type fare, look no further than the Firehouse.  I agree with Will in that it's very typical -- typical food, typical service, and a typical scene that you'd find in any such establishment.  Think of it as a Panini's (before they started popping up everywhere around the city).  We went on a Friday night, and it wasn't super busy. It was easy to get a table, and there was plenty of room to eat at the bar if we would've been down for it.  I had a southwest chicken salad that was good.  But then again, it's pretty hard to mess something up if it's smothered with my second favorite condiment, sour cream.  Unlike other bar/taverns, the music was at a nice volume, which actually made it possible to carry on a conversation while dining.  Not a bad spot if you're looking for a typically decent night out."}
{"text":"Waitress's had a bit of an attitude and made slightly nasty remarks. Food was wasn't terrible but not the best I've ever eaten. I would go there again if other places were full."}
{"text":"The food isn't the best but this is a decent place. The bartender, Jen is great. She knows everything about beer and she's very accommodating and friendly. The best thing about this bar is the happy hour on Wednesdays. 1/2 off all alcohol! Best beer special in town! They usually have a pretty good beer selection and fun seasonal drinks. They always seem under-staffed so Jen usually very busy doing everyone elses job, which makes the service slow at times. Don't come here if you're looking for an amazing meal, but it's a fun place to come with friends to get drunk!"}
{"text":"There's no waiting on Friday nights which is good and bad lol, it's not fast food and about the only place you can sit down together & have a drink and a meal at that time without waiting an hour or two.  Awesome drink menu with fun seasonal specialties. One of the main things that keeps me coming back on Friday eve for dinner is the bartender/waitress (I wish I knew her name, 50ish blonde medium/short length hair), she is my favorite waitress I believe I've ever had, can answer any question you have about the food or drinks, if you're not sure what drink you would like, she'll recommend a few different things for you.  This place is not upscale by far but she has the classiest yet comfortable personality that is such a pleasure, my husband and I both think she's great.  She deserves a big raise and I hope the owner appreciates what a gem he/she has."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar and grill. Love the outside patio. Get the mozzarella planks. Get them!"}
{"text":"Great service.  I went with the lobster mac and cheese. Loaded with hunks of lobster.  Fairly priced for a meal with lobster.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a fun bar! They have great $1 burgers that are a great sized burger plus all the toppings for only $1! They also have great flatbreads and a nice selection of beers. The atmosphere is fun and so it the wait staff, in addition to being very attentive and on the ball. I would recommend this bar and this location to anyone visiting Cuyahoga Falls downtown area."}
{"text":"A great place to hang with good friends. The staff are friendly and the food is consistently good"}
{"text":"Great service, some of the best lunch options in the Mayfield area, excellent patio, and a popular all you can eat fish fry Friday.  Firehouse is another one of my go-to lunch spots. They have a diverse menu, delicious daily specials and one of the most consistent staff of servers around. My usuals are either the whiskey chicken wrap with extra crispy fries, or the soup and salad combo where i sub their chili for the soup. My friend swears by their potato pancake burger, and my other friend loves their BLT melt. The portions are always filling, especially for the price.  During the Lent season, the AYCE fish fry on Friday is so good people drive from an hour away to taste, and for only $12 it is pretty unbeatable.  The patio is top notch for the summer time, but the inside has plenty of spacious seating and tvs for colder days as well, even a little game room with skeeball and pool tables."}
{"text":"The wings just had a bad flavor to them and the pork wings were super tough and dry."}
{"text":"If you want to have a 5-star dining experience, then forget Hyde Park and come to Firehouse instead. The service was prompt, friendly and our waitress, Stacy, was a total sweetheart. I ordered the \"giddy-up\" burger and let me tell you, I thought Michelangelo crafted this himself. The perfectly layered patty, onion rings and banana peppers had my taste buds tingling with joy. Let's not forget the bountiful beauties that is employed here... What a sight for sore eyes! The only real negative is the devil baby that was let loose by Satan himself. This creature was running around yelling like a monster, but that's just the awful parenting displayed by some single baby mama. Overall I give Firehouse 5 stars and would highly recommend this fine establishment to anyone!  Stay blessed not stressed."}
{"text":"Had a craving for good ribs, and Firehouse didn't disappoint.  Tasty ribs at almost half the cost of other places. Friendly happy efficient wait staff. Large patio. Will return"}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars.  The service is a little on the slow side.  The chili is pretty good.  Standard bar food... Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here in two weeks ... We had absolutely horrible service both times. The first time out waitress was MIA for most if the time and then messed up our bills. When I told her I didn't order three drinks she seemed to take it personally and got mad.  We ate there today and again the waitress wasn't around . She gave us our drinks and askers if we wanted food menus then didn't come back. We had to flag a random waitress down for our menus and still our waitress never came back. When we asked about it we were told it was because of a shift change. I didn't know a shift change meant that tables were forgotten about. The food was decent but don't go during happy hour because they have no idea what's going on."}
{"text":"Our first hint should have been the parking situation, or lack there of, this restaurant is on a street that you can't drive down, so turn down the access street just before Front St, and park in the parking lot at the end of that road.  Walking down Front St was a ghost down, and when we walked into Firehouse Grille & Pub at 5pm, it was too, just a couple of people at the bar.  We stood at the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign for over 5 minutes without being seated, and when we finally gave up and sat at the bar, one of the bar patrons jumped up and introduced herself as the waitress... though not ours apparently?  We waited another 2 or so minutes at the bar before an older lady, the bartender walked up with an attitude and asked to see our ID's before even saying hello, I'm young looking, but I am 30, so I was a bit shocked.  After we showed her our licenses, she told us that there was a beer special on black and tans, and a special on Stella's where you got to keep the chalice (we were not interested, but while we were there a couple sad suckers did bite, at which point i noticed that they were giving away the used, scuffed, cloudy looking sets that the bar had obviously already used... this just seemed disgusting to me, someone who normally goes to bars that do glass giveaways, NEW glass giveaways.)  We saw Angry Orchard on tap, and decided to order that, it was actually very good, very fresh tasting, it's a hard thing to find on tap, the good review ends there.  For food, I decided to order their \"home made and hearty, world famous, 2 alarm chili,\" which said it was served with cheese and sour cream.  The bf chose a hand crafted fire starter burger, which boasted a patty formed with crushed red pepper, jalapenos, Tabasco sauce and covered in melted mozzarella, he opted to sub out for the cheddar bacon fries, and ordered it all cooked med-rare.    When the food came out, it looked just ok, the patty on the burger was a weird grayish color, and very obviously came pre formed and frozen, it was covered in a few jalapeno slices and a slice of mozzarella cheese which had been melted.  It was cooked well done, no pink at all, and the bf said he couldn't taste ANY spice, his comment was that he should have gone to McDonald's instead, ouch, My chili looked decent, definitely a good color/consistency, though the sour cream came in a plastic ramekin and smelled like it had been in there for quite a while, i tasted it, but opted not to use it after that.  There was a sprinkling of fancy shredded Mexican cheese blend, and a couple of dehydrated looking diced red onion pieces on top.  As soon as I tasted it I knew immediately what their secret main ingredient was, I've tasted it a million times, Prego spaghetti sauce.  It essentially tasted like meaty spaghetti sauce with beans, in fact when the bf tried it, he said \"wow! spaghettios!\" Lol, I ate a few more spoonfuls, but the bf used it mainly to dip his fries in, saying it tasted like chunky ketchup.    Needless to say neither of us finished our food, nor did we bother taking it with us.  When we were done I had to chase down someone to give us our bill, at which point I saw that our tiny Apple Ciders were $6 a piece (a 6 pack at the store is $7.99) AND that we were up charged for the cheese and sour cream that \"came with\" the chili, AND charged for a full side of cheese bacon fries instead of a substitution price.  I begrudgingly paid the exorbitant bill and because of the flat out RUDE customer service left a big old 0 on the tip, first time in my whole life.  Can promise I will be checking my statements for the next month to make sure they didn't add on.  Summary: Terrible food, worse service, impossible parking, and ridiculous prices.  Worst place I've been in recent memory, will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Waitress was given credit card to open tab.  Upon asking to close tab, bartender said they didn't have the credit card.  The waitress denied ever getting the card yet when I opened the app for my bank, there was a pending transaction from the Firehouse.  The bar / manager offered no apology for the issue.  Contacted the police department to report the issue.  They indicated this has happened before. If you are going to go to this place, use cash.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Been here a few times after work functions.   Menu is decent...wings are good. Service is spotty. Usually, we have to ask for our server.   Beer selection is not special.   This is definitely not my first choice for a gathering place. It's simply...OK."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is a hidden gem.  Tucked away behind another restaurant, unless you are told, you would not know of it.  Short...straight out, the food is scrumptious. My wife and I had ribs, fries, cole slaw and onion strings. Wow-Yummy! Used to high end restaurants, the chef can dance with anyone of them. The price, however, is much lower. A real joy!  Reg"}
{"text":"Firehouse Grille & Pub rates a solid 4 stars.  I can't believe, I've waited this long to visit.  I live just a couple of miles away.  I met a friend at the restaurant on a wintry Thursday night,  The place was pretty full, as evidenced by the parking lot.  We were seated at a high-top table, near the front entrance.   We arrived separately, but I was warmly greeted, by our server, as soon as I sat down.  I proceeded to review the menu, lots of great appetizers, sandwiches, wraps and entrees.  Lots of options to choose from.  I opted for the Fried Shrimp dinner with homemade coleslaw, and fries.  My friend ordered the steak salad.  As we waited for our food to arrive, the dishes being delivered to the surrounding tables, looked good.  Our food arrived a short time later, I was not disappointed.  The shrimp were a decent size, the coleslaw was tasty and the fries were good, as well.  My meal was $10.99, you can't beat that!  The atmosphere is warm and cozy.  I was disappointed that there weren't more dessert selections, just fried twinkies, and candy bar sundaes.  I can absolutely see myself returning to try other options (can't wait)!"}
{"text":"Came here on a lonely Monday afternoon looking for a drink and some food. The bartender suggested some $4.99 lunch specials, and I ordered the stokes burger with homemade potato chips. My food arrived quickly and both were delicious! I couldn't stop munching on those chips. To drink I had a pint of Jacko pumpkin shandy on draft ($5) which was great! The booths each have TVs mounted on the wall which I thought was really cool. There were some fruit flies lurking around but the taps were covered. I'd definitely come back again and would recommend Firehouse to anyone looking for some grub or a beer."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with one of my coworkers two nights ago.  All the food we had was amazing.  Totally suggest the artichoke dip.  The quesadillas are amazing as well and still good the next day.  The staff is probably the second best part!  So kind and welcoming.  Outside porch area.  Open late.  Perfect spot!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Friday night - about 5:30pm. Rockin' on the River was just starting to roll, so I wanted to relax with a cold beer and a light meal. I'll say that this is my favorite Firehouse Grille (I've been to East Market, Tallmadge and Springfield) maybe because of the environment and decor, but it seemed like the customers AND the staff were having an equally good time - and that good attitude is hard to resist. They were actually having a 70's Disco theme night - the staff was dressed appropriately, and they had Donna Summer, Village People, BeeGees and lots of other funky stuff cranking on the tunebox.  Service was very efficient, the staff was friendly and the prices - as expected - were very reasonable. I had a fried shrimp basket which was very good, and a gal that sat at the bar next to me got the $1 burger special - which was so good, she ordered another. They were not crappy little burgers, either, but big, full-size jucyburgers.  I enjoyed a couple of Stellas; they have a nice selection of beers on tap and in the botle as well. As I said, the crowd was fun - a nice mix of people, age-wise,  anywhere from late 20's to 50 or so. Nice energy...very comfortable crowd (this is Cuyahoga Falls, after all) so people seemed upbeat as they prepared to go out and catch the band on the Riverfront.  Overall, a pleasant surprise - and I'm sure I'll be back again when I'm up this way."}
{"text":"Usually I enjoy the Firehouse Grilles, good food at cheap prices. However, I went to the one on Front St awhile ago (forgot about the picture), and saw that they put a sign outside of the bathroom that read \"Please allow the staff to use the bathroom first. They cannot wait in a line while at work.\" See pictures. Really? I mean I get what they are saying, but I'm the customer. Maybe they should look into adding an extra bathroom if this is such a huge problem. I just think that sign is ridiculous. If that situation arises then the employee should politely ask if they can go first."}
{"text":"I stopped up to the Firehouse to meet a buddy and watch the Indians play Boston. We sat out on the patio and I know smoking in bars has pretty much been banned but I think every smoker in Ohio was out on this patio and puffing away quite handily. I alone watched one woman completely smoke an entire pack of cigarettes by herself standing next to me. But none of that is the fault of the bar. My review is going to Encompass the meal I had which was a buffalo chicken salad. Ordinarily a buffalo chicken salad has chunks of chicken or chicken fingers that are tossed in Buffalo sauce and put on a salad mix and served with a dressing. This one came with an obnoxious amount of wing sauce poured on the salad and on the side of the bowl. I had some ranch to put on there but it just made the salad kind of soupy. The chicken was actually really really good it was crispy and cut up into chunks. However I just wish they would have held back on the obnoxious amount of wing sauce was put on top of the salad. It was a really good atmosphere lots of people were there and a beautiful night for being out by the bar. Four stars 42 much wing sauce"}
{"text":"This place is a puzzle to get into and food was terrible.    The building has a few different doors that bring you into dining areas, but no one was around to seat you, or direct you where to go. We found the bar and ate there since that's the only place with employees.  I had the seafood pasta and it was disgusting. The crab meat was that fake \"crab meat\", the shrimp was hard and very fishy tasting.  The pasta had nothing on it... Plain pasta and fake crab YUCK!   My boyfriend liked the Cobb salad though...."}
{"text":"I unfortunately eat here at lot because my in laws like it.  Firehouse is constantly bad.   I always try something new on the menu hoping i just made a poor decision in the past.  I have had several different sandwiches and they have all been lack luster.  The service is also underwhelming.  It is always hard to park there. The only good thing to say about Firehouse is that they have an awesome outdoor bar that is great in the summer.  A good place to drink- thats it."}
{"text":"A great addition to Downtown Cuyahoga Falls's Falls Riverfront District, Firehouse Grille & Pub has the atmosphere to please everybody.  Honestly, this is probably the nicest location of theirs that I've been to. Most are in somewhat dilapidated buildings, but this one is in a two-story building from the 1920s, complete with lighting fixtures, mirrors, bartops, and countless other items from the Roaring Twenties.  One thing that is EVERYWHERE that is definitely not a throwback to that era: televisions. They're at the bar, on the walls in random places, and at every booth. Every single booth has a television, meaning you can watch Spongebob, Intervention, or whatever you like to watch a the bar instead of a sporting event.  Food here is oversized, but very inexpensive. I ordered the 2-Alarm Chili Fries. While they weren't amazing, they were adequate. I had enough to feed all three of us at the bar, and they were only $6.99.  Drink prices are easily the best in the Akron area at the Firehouse. Where else can you get $4 pints of Blackout Stout or $1.50 Yuenglings? Nowhere, that's where. (Yes, I just answered my own rhetorical question. Deal with it.) The bartenders here are great and knowledgeable. They told me they have over 1,500 drink combinations they sell here at the Firehouse. I don't even know if I can think of 50 drinks from the top of my head.  For the atmosphere and the drink prices, it's hard to top the Firehouse in C-Falls."}
{"text":"Great place don't be alarmed By the full parking lot  Find a spot and go on in Great food and drinks"}
{"text":"As many other reviewers have noted, the service is lacking. However, the food makes up for it. Great burger selection (gotta try the potato pancake burger) and some of the best fries I've ever had."}
{"text":"Only had apps but shoot! Prrrrrretty darn tasty!!! The spinach artichoke dip with a really soft flatbread was superb!!! Beer battered mushrooms???  Effin awsome!  The downside, we were on the patio which was the size of my bathroom and hiptser poseurs were smoking like 5 feet away from our table...."}
{"text":"Great location. Decent interiors. Good prices for what you get. Our waitress was nice & friendly. I need to go again so I can provide more details."}
{"text":"This is the closest place to have a restaurant meal during the Friday night music fests in Cuyahoga Falls, right around the corner from the stage.  But don't expect much.   Have the hamburger, because they're not so good when they try to get fancy.      I appreciate their initiative in coming up with special menus for events - an Italian menu for the Italian Fest, etc.   But it was all tasteless.  And when there was Reggae music playing at IROK, they offered a Caribbean menu that we were foolish enough to try:  Chicken  on a mushy pile of white rice. Bad.  The menu didn't list the price, but it was $13.    My wife barely touched it and talked to the waitress about how she couldn't finish it.  The manager knocked a whopping $2 off the bill.   According to their sign, this place is \"The home of the dollar burger\", but they charge $8 for it.   Beers are not cheap here, either.  $6 for a short Guinness.   Not really a bad place for a burger and Budweiser.  Waitresses are friendly and have always done an excellent job. The atmosphere isn't bad.  But you'd be better off with the food trucks outside - better food and much cheaper."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place, it get real busy at times, hard to get a table.  They have a kick ass patio, however they have a kick ass amount of smokers there as well.  Alcohol is inexpensive, food is decent quality, service is super friendly. The wings are always hot and crispy. Fish fry is really good, and they even cooked my steak a perfect Medium.  This place is solid, never had a negative experience."}
{"text":"The worst thing this place ever did was nix the Freddie fries from the menu. I've only been back a few times since it happened. It's just not the same. It is a good place to chill and watch a game if you're there before the late night party crew rolls in.  Thank you Marty for responding to be. I have been told multiple times that the Freddy fries were not available. I am going to come in and try again. They are one of my favorite things ever. Can't believe they were not more popular. They're delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to the Firehouse several times a week for years and we have never once had a negative  experience. The food and service is exceptional and the staff - there's not enough words or adjectives to express our satisfaction with them. We know them by name and consider them friends. We had our daughter's baby shower there and Rachel went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. We're having my wife's 70th birthday party there in June and mine in April. It's our favorite place to hang out and we highly recommend it.  Fran and Don Willis"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. The spinach dip was tasteless. The Bacon cheese fries had canned cheese. The patty melt wasn't grilled.  About the only thing they couldn't ruin was the bottled beer, which was awesome.   The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Firehouse has some really delicious things on their menu, but they are terribly inconsistent.  Consistency is often all you can count on at a place like this.  I like the chipotle chicken sandwich a lot!  But, only sometimes.  Sometimes the chicken breast is juicy and plump, and sometimes it is like a shingle.  Stick with a supplier and don't put anyone on the grill that doesn't know what they're doing.  I got the bacon cheeseburger soup once, as ridiculous as it sounded, and it exceeded my expectations of being ridiculous.  It was awful.  It was like a bowl of hot mayonnaise with bacon and gound beef.  YUM!  On another occasion, I got a chili cheeseburger that was highly touted by the waittress.  Came with onion rings.  Sounded like a great experience.  I got one of those mis-cut buns where the bottom was wafer thin and the top was the size of house.  Needless to say, there was no picking it up.  Oh, and my 2 onion rings, yes TWO... they were cold.  On the other hand, their fried mozzarella can't be beat, their happy hour beer specials are damn good, and their burgers and sandwiches are normally very good.  I liked it better when it was Marinko's, but as close as it is to my office, it's still a good after work option from time to time."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday late afternoon. OSU game on, decent amount of people in there, couple of people out on the patio enjoying the game. Our server was a super nice guy. The spinach and artichoke dip with pita chips is sooo good! I had the cajun chicken sandwich which was awesome and very, very filling and my sister got the Cobb salad which she loved, but she wished that she got the same sandwich that I did because it was so good. Has a bit of a kick. Good prices, cool little place, yummy food, good service."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming to the Firehouse. The menu offers a great variety. Ribs and pizza are my favorites.   Summer evenings are usually filled so there may be a little wait. Have a drink at the bar and just hang with friends until you're seated."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with The Firehouse.  I love drinking there but I generally hate the food.  Unless I drink a lot, and then I can't get enough of their flatbread pizzas.  This is a great place to go for a happy hour gathering or to throw a party of some sort.  I held a surprise birthday party for my boyfriend on the patio a few years back and the manager worked with me to provide a decent spread of food for our guests.  This isn't my favorite local bar by any means, but it's a pretty good place to hang out.    Note that there are a bunch of fire hydrants on one side of the building in the parking area.  They're fake, but every time I go there, I think I'm in a fire zone and then remember the bar is called The Firehouse.  Duh.  Parking is at a premium, so on a happening weekend night, you might have to park across the street in what looks like a place you shouldn't park in.  Support your local watering holes!"}
{"text":"From their Facebook Page:  This Firehouse location is closed for the foreseeable future. To our loyal customers and friends we thank you for all of your support these past five years!! To those of you gracious enough to buy the German Beer Steins and Das Boots, supporting our annual charity event, those monies received are being donated to the Battered Woman's Shelter in Akron. Again thank you for your friendship from the entire staff!!"}
{"text":"I love going to the firehouse. Service is always prompt and friendly. Food is above average for a sports bar/grille.  I do agree with a other review that it is a bit puzzling to get into the first time you come so I will say this! USE THE SIDE DOOR next to the parking area. It brings you right into the bar area and you will find a hostess/seating there easily.  Also would like to recommend the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and the BBQ chicken pizza. Both have never failed me and are my \"go-to's\" when I visit here!"}
{"text":"The Firehouse is a typical sports-themed bar/tavern. I've only been there on Wednesdays twice. Both times, it has been relatively crowded and there's an outdoor bar and patio with a lot of seating.  They've had 4 beers on tap, Dort, Labatte, Miller Lite, and a rotating microbrew. The beer prices aren't very cheap $4.75 for a tall Dort, alas.   The service has been fine on both visits.   Yesterday, one of our compadres had to leave early and we asked for the check, the manager apologized that he'd have to wait 15 minutes since the computer system was down, but he gave a free round of beers to compensate, although he filled up the Great Lakes ones only half way, hah.   My first visit 2 weeks ago, 2 guys were 3 sheets to the wind, accosted us in conversation, said he started the day at a local golf course, then went somewhere else which was cash only, they ran out of money, and then came there. Their menu looks like typical bar food, priced reasonable, $5-12 for most entrees and sandwiches. Both times, we've had the Wednesday special, a pizza (8 slices) for $6. 3 pizzas filled a hungry group of 9 or so. I've had the bbq chicken pizza, which for $6 was an very good deal."}
{"text":"Love the broccoli salad & chili & chips. The turkey Reuben is different than the usual Reuben, so I didn't like it. I went for the AYCE soup & salad lunch on Monday. I like that you can switch what soup or salad you get, so you can enjoy one bowl of chicken tortilla, then switch to French onion.  I brought my laptop to work on, but the wifi was spotty. Four stars because the service is good, food is slightly better than bar food but nothing fantastic, & location is great. Good pub."}
{"text":"I agree with Jordan and Will's review of Firehouse and think that this place is a solid 3 stars.  I've visited this place probably a dozen times and 10 out of the 12 times I had fun, granted most of those times I was with a group out on the beautiful patio 1 sheet to the wind at about 1am but it was fun.  There are bands that come and play during the summer and winter months which make is a close nit affair seeing that the 3 times I've watched a band here, they set up in the main bar and it had that acoustic feel.....which I kind of enjoyed.  As for the food, its good, typical, nothing I can absolutely recommend, but if you're hungry and aching for a cold beer, its a safe bet.  The wait staff is usually pretty nice and I just found out a old bartender friend of mine started a couple months ago so I'll start frequenting this place more often just to change things up.  I'm so frickin predictable aren't I?  Did someone say happy hour??"}
{"text":"Friday AYCE fish fry is definitely worth a trip. I's only $12 (one more than the regular dinner). We drive out from Painesville b/c we think it's the best fish fry around. Try the siracha coleslaw. Wife got the cedar planked stuffed salmon and it had a nice flavor. They were busy but we found a spot and a table and the service was good as three different servers were helping us. I love the history of the building but it can be a drawback. Some of the dining areas are small and makes the volume pretty high, so fine if you're ready for a bar feel and not a quiet meal. Plenty of TV's and games, three pool tables, darts, etc. Patio is also nice and heated (when appropriate). Not vegetarian friendly however, you're either getting a wrap or a pizza."}
{"text":"Very good food. Service has fallen off over the years, but there are still some terrific staff members who will bend over backwards for the customers."}
{"text":"Third time I've been there, food is always GREAT! We sat where we wanted, server was very nice & promptly took our order! Tables & seats were clean...which lets face it, a LOT of places are not so careful w keeping tables, chairs & menus actually clean these days!  We ordered 10 bbq wings, 10 garlic parm & 10 buffalo wings, all boneless, sold in 10's and only 50cents ea on Wing Tuesdays! All were nice, fresh, crispy outside & juicy inside! Sauces were FAB!! Best wings I have had in YEARS! We also ordered an order of fries to share, onionstraws and the Mac & Cheese! soooo good!! All cooked at right temps so the fries & onionstraws weren't greasy at all, and were nice & crisp! The mac & cheese comes out in the little single serving castiron skillet, it had the right amount of cheese & the bit of breadcrumbs on top for a little bit of crunch!  Previous visit we had the cheesesteak & a burger w fries....all GREAT!! Prices cannot be beat!! Bbq chicken pizzas here are DELISH!!"}
{"text":"This place might have been awesome had my hot chocolate been spiked with peppermint schnapps. It was far from being the worst bar food but it's not a place you would go out of your way to try.  The place was pretty empty and the decor kind of made me depressed. I'm all about exposed brick & semi-vintage decor but what appears to be an attempt at a posh hangout comes off as a dilapidated empty home instead. I wasn't quite sure how to take our waitress either. One minute it seemed as if she had an attitude problem & the next she was so nice & sweet (maybe a rough day?).   Food wise, if you suffer from acid reflux or IBS but crave buffalo hot sauce then you probably could indulge in their  Buffalo dip with nachos due to it's lack of flavor. It was so bland that you could barely taste the buffalo sauce at all. My husband enjoyed there  wings although his pork wings were dry. But on a brighter note, I drink hot chocolate year round and EVERY place serves the same damn watery powdered mix but NOT the Firehouse- they have the BEST HOT CHOCOLATE EVER!!!!!!  So, in conclusion, if you're in the middle of a zombie apocalypse and duck in here to hide; you wont starve to death but you might find your company more flavorful..."}
{"text":"Love the firehouse....ESP ESP in the summer!   Killer patio bar.  Fun staff too!!!  Jay Wright the owner is amazing and always has killer fun epic bars!!!!"}
{"text":"The worst service and unfriendly staff I have ever encountered. Very slow service and each time we came across a server or bartender we had to beg for their attention. It was not a busy night either. Not a single worker there had any interest in serving us. Bathrooms were very unclean as well, with toilet paper and trash scattered on the floor. The place needs a good cleaning and updated decor as well as updated staff that are a little more friendly."}
{"text":"Their seafood pasta is pretty good for bar food.  They have the thick-cut steak fries that are hot and crispy.  Tuesdays is their .40 boneless wing night, so try their Cajun boneless wings if you like spice!  I like that they are one of the few places that have pool tables around this area, and they have 3 tables so there usually isn't a wait.  Pool is pretty affordable too    ($8 per hour) compared to Fox and the Hound.  It's a decent local bar for after work drinks."}
{"text":"This is pretty much your run of the mill sports bar.  They have a decent amount of TVs but nothing special, a private party room, at least two pool tables, darts, and of course the bar staple Golden tee.  The real draw is that its a good lunch time spot.  They have a nice diverse menu of sandwichs and pastas and such beyond your typical staple bar food of burgers and such.  Not sure what their drink selection is like but I would assume its nothing spectacular but I do believe they get a nice bar scene on the weekends and often have live local bands.  For a bar in the area its not bad but I'm rating it more on its food than its draw as a bar so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"I had a HORRIBLE experience at the Firehouse Grille when I was in town for a wedding. It was in a darling downtown district, so I thought it would be good. Wrong.  For starters, the place was practically empty and it took forever for one of the staff to come over and seat us. While the ambiance was fine--staple bar atmosphere--the staff was not. Our waitress had only us as a table and took 20 minutes to bring our drinks. Once she did, it took her another 10 minutes to come back and take our order. For those of you counting, that's 30 minutes just sitting at the booth waiting to order in an empty bar.   I ordered the nachos with ground beef. When she brought them out, the cheese was cold. The worst part was the 'ground beef.' It was literally torn up pieces of a hamburger patty! It had been seasoned and cooked as a hamburger, so the flavor of that mixing with the nacho ingredients was TERRIBLE. My date's food was fine, nothing spectacular, and I wound up sharing it with him. The waitress made some comment about me being a 'prissy city girl' and that's why I must not have liked my nachos. For the record, I'm from rural Missouri, and that sort of behavior from a server does not earn tips, and so she didn't.   Oh, and we never got refills.   Big thumbs down. I would avoid this if in the downtown area, but there seemed to be other options in the district--go there instead."}
{"text":"Umm...so apparently on a Saturday night, no one goes here?  We had a bus drop us off here and were the only ones in the bar!  Overall, it was a fine bar.  The ceiling was pretty and there were some nice flat screens up on the wall...but we were so lonely!"}
{"text":"Met a group of friends for dinner at Firehouse. I had the petite filet and boy, they aren't messing around with that description because it's PETITE!! It was cooked well and was tasty and had a delicious crab cake on the side with decent steamed veggies.  My husband had the ribs. They told him they were fall of the bone and that didn't seem to be true. He said the sauce was decent but the ribs were okay.  Great service. After dinner we went to the heated patio and was surprised to find that we didnt need our coats in November. Those heating lights do a great job of keeping the place toasty, despite it being wide open to the outdoors. We would go back."}
