{"text":"This place had me the moment I stepped in. Cool decor and utensils, dedicated and pleasant staff, great food and overall fantastic place to go to with friends on a Friday night. I've been there 3 times already and am planning at least another visit before NYE !"}
{"text":"nice place and super welcoming staff, i went with my boyfriend and we took the tasting menu. we liked few selections, they have really unique ingredients in each meal. For a first you should rather choose something yourself than the testing menu, drinks are good (asian fusion style) and black sesame ice cream was nomm"}
{"text":"Not realizing it was a tapas place was a bit of a downer when going for dinner, but nonetheless very good food and great service!!!! Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I come here at least once a month =P Lively ambiance and consistent food, and they have a seasonal menu that changes frequently. Very good karaage and oshizushi, and I really like the unagi bibimbap and Osaka fry."}
{"text":"Tout est top. La musique est quelque peu forte mais on s'y habitue rapidement ; même avec des enfants.
Mais alors : quel délice ! !!
Et l'accueil et le départ se font au son du bienvenue et du au revoir japonais. 
Vraiment : une adresse à retenir."}
{"text":"I know it's a bar...but it's so LOUD in here you can barely hear each other. Everything is so damn overpriced and food portion is teenie tiny, we had to go somewhere else to eat again. Staffs are unfriendly, unprofessional and all they do is yell around in Japanese and interrupt your conversation. Overall, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good food 
A bit pricey and the service  is unhelpful and makes mistakes often 
 very loud"}
{"text":"Make a reservation. It was full on a Saturday night. The food was fairly good for the price but nothing you can't get elsewhere. The service was excellent but the restaurant is a bit loud."}
{"text":"Très beau décor, belle ambiance! 
On a commandé le menu à partager, une belle variation à déguster. Très bon!!

Juste pas facile à garder vos manteaux sauf dans un placard non surveillé.

We enjoyed our dinner a lot. Cool atmosphere, fun.
We had the menu to share which we liked , it has a good mix.

I recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was really really poor. It took 45 mins for any drinks to arrive at the table. The server brought food out in no particular order, one person had finished all 4 plates before another person at our table had his first dish. The server did not return to our table after dropping our initial round of plates off. They did not clear the unused plates off the table. 

At checkout they did not know who ordered what dish, and it took us a lengthy process of returning to the register before they could get it right. On top of that, they added an %18 gratuity to our orders which is only supposed to be done for a party of 7 or greater. 

Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been to most of the Guu's in Vancouver and the Guu in Toronto...I was not a fan of this restaurant. The staff were very enthusiastic and friendly, but the food was average.

We ordered a total of four dishes: the beef carpaccio, an octopus daily special, bibimbap, and the Saba.

The beef carpaccio wasn't exciting. There was rice vinegar, the beef itself...honestly it was boring. The taste was not outstanding and adding onion to the dish may have highlighted the beef for me, but there was no onion.

The tako/octopus was cut too thick and the sauce that accompanied the dish didn't taste like it belonged. It was too spicy for the octopus. The octopus was tasteless and the sauce was too much.

Bibimbap was too salty and by the time we finished our first bite of the bibambap the rest of the rice was burnt. We did not mix the bowl ourselves but a staff member helped us, which I appreciated, but it was clear that it was not mixed well.

The Saba was even more over seasoned than the rice. The sauce was extremely salty despite having a perfectly cooked piece of fish sitting on top. 

Overall, the food was very average. The staff members were pleasant but the food really needs improvement."}
{"text":"Pricey but pretty good...

The food is decent, nice sake list, the daily specials are pretty cool. The chicken karaage is good hits the spot everytime. The octopus carpaccio was amazing. 

It is too loud here, really I have to scream at my friend to be heard, and they really should do away with the annoying greetings. 

The place looks very clean, and the service is consistent, I go pretty often because it's not so busy anymore so it's easy to get a table. Imadake is too busy, so is Kazu. The food is comparable to Imadake but Kazu is still king in my book :)

Still quite happy with this place though."}
{"text":"Really noisy place, we can hardly hear each other across the same table (2plates away). It takes forever for the waiter to arrive to take our order, not recommended. They take the girls next to us, who arrived after us, first, really disappointed. We don't have place to put our jackets cuz they are car pooling us with other customers. Even Imadake, which I'm not really into, can do better than this. Not recommended is you want to have a descent meal.

Tips: no reservations on the same day, avoid rush hours, communicate with sms with friends."}
{"text":"First time coming and definitely not the last. The food was amazing. Came for the lunch service and the servers were really nice."}
{"text":"amazing food, service, environment, drinks (suggestions: take, sakura & hana) and music."}
{"text":"Certain plates sont correctes. Mais le sushi pressé est vraiment pas bon. La place est trop bruyant et incapable de s'entendre. On dirait un cafétéria de l'école. Le prix est un peu cher."}
{"text":"almost everything i tried (not the sushi) was instant  frozen stuff refried (i know it is because i used to work in a ghetto sushi place) and the beef sashimi salad (im not sure of the name) was not good ... i should of tried the sushi & sashimi platter but i wanted to try something new/ something homemade... but too bad it wasnt what i expected // maybe i had too high expectations

I tried the takoyakis (maybe instant refried frozen/ it was too hard)
The okonomiyaki (maybe frozen)
Unagi bibimbap (ok)
Rare Beef on plain salad with mayo sauce on it
Udong (instant noodles)
And more i dont remember 

We were 2 and we payed 40$ each so 80$ total 
Not worth the price for non handmade stuff 

The thing is i dont have a high palette of whatever i just like eating but when i pay 80$ for food i want it to taste like 80$"}
{"text":"The food is good, but I guess I expected larger portions for the regular meals that included rice portions with them for the price they were at. 

Our waiter was nice, but overall service is very poor and ill-managed. It wasn't busy when we came in, but they somehow were able to bring out our dishes horrendously slow and out-of-order until the restaurant was starting to fill up. By that time, maybe half of our table got their entrees, and when the other half got their food, the others had finished ages ago. Then all the appetizers, which are easier and fastest to make, were all at the end, after we all finished our meals."}
{"text":"I just love this place and i keep being amazed every time I go!  What i enjoy is that each time they deliver a fun delicious experience. They have a diversified menu with a plate to please any palate. It's fun to order a bunch of plates and share with your friends. Their drink menu also is worth to highlight which you can choose from different sakes and incredible sake sangrias or mojitos. You get a bang for your buck and will love the fun social experience!
 My faves : sashimi salad, pork belly, ribsteak and sake berry sangria. 
Kinka Izakaya delivers just the right atmosphere and succulent food for a great night between friends!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the hype. I am on a roll with izakayas recently and this place does remind me of Guu.

We showed up on a Sunday at 5 pm (the opening) and although being the first in line, the place filled up in no time after we sat down. Decor-wise you will find some small tables but more buffet-type larger tables for share. We were seated at the bar for a party of three and I got to peak at the food preparation and plating. As expected, the loud cheer upon arrival and departure is also part of the experience.

Food-wise, a great izakaya. Seasoning of the dishes are on the stronger end. I can imagine those who like bolder flavours to love the food here. Ingredients were definitely fresh which would be expected with the amount of turnover at this place. One dish that was more memorable for me was the mackerel. It's not typically a fish I like but this was cooked tender, with a good balance of flavour and right amount of char on the skin. The other dishes we had were more the everyday variety (udon, Japanese pancake, tuna tartare, etc) and nothing was a let down. I feel like on a lazy day I can just close my eyes and chose anything and be guaranteed a good meal. Portions are quite large for an izakaya, you can guaranteed to be full if you have a carb-heavy choice per person (with other apps to share of course).

All in all, I can't wait to come back again.

Last point - the girl's bathroom is quite a sight. Not sure if this is the custom in Japan but the bathroom was equipped from mouth wash, lotion down to sanitary napkins. I definitely don't see that everyday."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with my bestie, and had a great time! Firstly, the staff cumulatively greet you as you enter and leave, which I thought was awesome. I could imagine some might find this annoying, as there was lots of yelling and noise. We decided to share a couple of dishes, so that we could try multiple things. I don't remember all of the dish names, unfortunately, but we got the edamame (standard), the oyster dish (creamy and cheesy goodness), the octopus balls (fried, delicious), the salmon sushi (fresh, salmon perfectly cooked - still slightly raw), and a tuna dish (didn't get to try this, but my friend said it was yummy). Overall, everything was fresh and so delicious! We were at the bar, and got to see the cooks doing their thing. So fun! They also have an outdoor terrasse, and are located right near Le faubourg (heart of downtown, near guy concordia). I will say that service was a little slow, it took a while to order and pay, but I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya has a great atmosphere that is fun and feels like you have just walked into a party. For those of you who are looking for a quiet night eating delicious Japanese food, this place is not for you. I typically go for dinner around 6 pm or after 9 pm and generally don't have to wait. I went last weekend around 7 pm and ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a table. 

Every time that I visit, I order the saba. It is amazing and possibly the best that I have ever eaten. The fish is placed on a bed of onions, sliced lemons and herbs, the bones are removed, and it is cooked to perfection. The only downside is that it takes about 20 minutes to cook. Well worth the wait though. Overall, the selection is more authentic than a lot of the Japanese restaurants in town, and the fact that they are small plates allows you to try a lot of new dishes or share with the table. The staff is very friendly, and the prices are reasonable. Will go back again."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! And have been here many times. It's an easy atmosphere to enjoy so you can come alone or on a date or just to hang out with friends. And because it's like tapas, you can spend as much or as little as you wish. I would highly recommend the sushis and sashimis, especially the scallops! The marinated jellyfish is addictive (If you've never had jellyfish before, it's similar to seaweed, say a wakame salad). The pork will melt in your mouth and you cannot miss the black cod with miso, you will never enjoy fish the same way again"}
{"text":"LOVE!! 
Service was great & super quick! Staff was extremely friendly, always smiling & they seemed to be enjoying what they're doing! 
Great ambiance & the food was delicious! 
Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"The food quantity is so little! We were 2 and ordered 6 dishes yet we were still starving afterwards!
The service is very poor! 2 waitresses only and it takes so long to get water!!!!!!
Our calmari rings were also cold and uncooked! Did not enjoy this at all!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Super friendly staff and pretty solid food.  
My favs are the kamimayo (baked oysters with spinach, cheese and mushrooms) and unagi bimbimbop.  Both are definitely great dishes.  The daily specials can be hit or miss.  One time we had the salmon belly sashimi and it's great.  One time we had the tuna sushi ball and it wasn't anything special and way too much rice.  Sashimi salad is pretty good with a variety of fish and fancy seaweeds.  Kimchi-nabe was good with dumplings, kimchi, tofu and pork, although some of the pork slices were still very \"stuck together\", like they were frozen before and didn't get separated before throwing in to the pot.  But it's a pretty good dish for a cold day and not overly spicy.  

The biggest disappointment was the black miso cod. Usually a fan of this dish at any Japanese restaurants and don't know how they could screw this one up.  I think it's the quality of the fish... not fresh or super frozen previously.. the texture of the fish was very strange and definitely made it to the worst black miso cod I've ever had list.  And the miso sauce was a little bit much on the top too.  My least favor dish for sure at this place.  

Love the menu, looks overwhelming but very easy to navigate with all languages displayed together.  The chefs and staff like to shout constantly... like some of the Japanese joints where they shout when customers come in and out.  They were shouting a bit too much and seemed like they were shouting when every single dish was made... funny and entertaining.  Definitely not a place if you're looking for a quiet or romantic meal.  But not annoying, just shouting too much for my taste.  good music though.  definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"I do not believe that it's an authentic Japanese. The food was so bad, I ordered a ramen and it was basically a broth with noodles, salmon tataki was extremely bad. It was a bad experience. Don't ever trust a restaurant that has pictures on the menu."}
{"text":"Definitely a different style of restaurant but completely worth all the confusion.

The waitstaff and kitchen staff are always yelling things across the restaurant and out on the patio at customers. I'm pretty sure they're saying something like \"thank you for coming\" though so at least it's not obscene profanities. 

The food was great! As for sushi and sashimi, I think there are only two options which kinda sucks but the rest of the menu is great. They have hot plates and cold plates to share with your party and I've never had anything I hated. Some of the slices of meat are a little hard to chew but it's not something I can't work around. 

Would recommend if you're open to trying Japanese cuisine that doesn't consist of sushi and sashimi."}
{"text":"A little bit of Tokyo in Montreal .Brought by the Kinka family .

Okay how am I supposed to review this ..
For once that I truly felt in love with such a restaurant in Montreal. A lot of people who know me knows that I'm a sucker for Japanese food --having had amazing experiences at Guu in Toronto and Vancouver. Although , the food is not 100% authentic , let's just say they nailed it in term of concept and food quality.

My experience here was  memorable as I got the opportunity to visit this place during their pre-opening week. 

One of the first thing to note here is that their staff are new and I think it's going to take a hit of time for them to get down to their desired customer service and experience , I'm going to be fair and I'm going to say it was okay. Staff seems eager to get rid of your plates sometimes --without asking and eye contacts is not omnipresent. I guess those are things that they can work on.
But so far , I did see the manager on the floor , telling them how to become more efficient and how to give the best experience to customers. A+ to that man , he managed Toronto's Guu in the last and he will be in no time manage to get this restaurant to it's full capacity in no time.

Food experience was excellent.
The Okonomiyaki was above average as compared to other places I've tried in Montreal. The pancake was just enough crispy to make me enjoy the squids! They didn't go overboard with their sauce either.

The gyu tataki salad was the most memorable plate for me. this plate was not only refreshing but the beef sashimi actually tasted amazing. One has to try to explain the feelings I had while slowly biting and savouring my experience with this dish. Indeed, if you come here , I highly recommend trying this.

The last dish I had taken was the Kimchi udon--I'll be honest , it wasn't great. I think it was a little bit overpriced and lacked some flavours. At that price , you could also expect a bigger portion when it's concern noodles and kimchi but it wasn't the case. 

Overall, I'll give this place 5 stars , from the moment I walked in and to the moment I walked out , I had a great izakaya experience. Although , it's not the perfect spot to drink just yet based on the crowd--I think it will only slowly become based on the service , food and my high expectations from Kinka family.
Food wise it can definitely improve , and I hope it will as they can bring so many plates from their franchise. And to have a happy time , note that bottle of sake are not expensive, a group will easily have a blast with booze if they want.

Do I plan to come back here in the future ? 
Definitely , and then I will re-review my experience to see whether they have match ,exceed or failed to respond to my expectations."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, wait staff was inattentive. Overall a good experience with flavorful food but service could be a bit better. I waited an hour to get a plate and had to ask twice for a cup of water."}
{"text":"This was the very first experience eating in Montreal. After an 8 hour drive from Manhattan, the atmosphere immediately lifted our spirits. The food was better than several omakases in NYC. Would recommend this place to anybody. I would recommend the miso cod, tuna tartar, beef noodles, and any dish with salmon in it."}
{"text":"Actually I'm a big fan of Japanese food. I'm so excited to try this restaurant. But everything here was too salty. Beef ribs were black and scorched. Staffs are unfriendly, no smile on their face and they gave us wrong meal and bill."}
{"text":"Hey hey 

I'm NUMBER ONE fan of Japanese food. I went with a group of 4 friends. At the moment we enter the restaurant, all the employee Welcome us in Japanese +(wave) :D (This made me happy).

They have a very nice place and seat where you can store your coat.
We were only 4, so we had to share a long table with strangers. (Awkward at first, but it was alright when the food arrived)

So many dishes to try !!! Luckily i did some research before, so i knew a bit of what I wanted to order.

The food came really fast. Beautiful, Flavourful, exciting!
My favourite one was the EBIMAYO. I go crazy for Fried Shrimp and those shrimps were super big haha.
Takoyaki, Crazy quality. #Speechless

For the dessert, the Matcha creme brulee = Must-try (OBLIGER) lol

For the service, it was really good. Our Metal cup (yes) were always full and I liked how they ask us If we enjoy the experience. 

I was happy that another table celebrate their birthday.
Half of the staff went near the table and start singing in Japanese and Happy birthday in English. They even brought a blackboard with HBD on it. Even if it wasn't my friend bday, we could feel the excitement through us haha. 

When we left the place, they all screamed in japanese and waved at us. Best feeling ever!

This was an amazing experience. I recommend you all to give it a try.

Food lover~

Yeye"}
{"text":"Some of the best Japanese food I've ever had. Loud but great atmosphere. Felt transported to Japan in the middle of downtown. Price was decent for the quality of the food. Service was quick even though we went on a busy Friday night and staff was very friendly. Would recommend this place to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Food is good, great ambiance but a bit noisy. Not impressed about the service, they brought us our bill and wanted us to pay while I was waiting for my dessert that took them forever to bring."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable price, especially the noodle and rice dishes! Big serving, great authentic taste. The vibe is very pub-like and the workers have loads of energy like a traditional japanese izayaka. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I went there like several weeks ago and I gotta say, it's better than I expected. The foods are pretty great and the staffs seem really nice. I recommend here if you love noodles or like to try out some japanese foods for the first time!"}
{"text":"Very nice environment, the atmosphere is great, design is lovely. 

The food is a bit similar to Imadake . Very interesting options to discover."}
{"text":"Très variés, j'adore la formule tapas à partager. Cela nous a permis d'essayer plein de choses délicieuses! Bel endroit très propre,  très accueillant. J'ai trouvé ça mignon qu'ils saluent tout le monde qui arrive et qui quitte le resto dans leur langue."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there for lunch because it was just around the corner from her place. She always found it lively and welcoming, specially because they shout their greetings when you enter.  We weren't disappointed.  The atmosphere was lively and and nice. Our orders came within a reasonable time and they were delicious.  We had the beef carpaccio and the takoyaki, although on hindsight, we should have ordered more.  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Great food and friendly staff. I have been here at least 7x already and will definitely keep coming back.  I recommend making a reservation online because this place gets pretty busy every night."}
{"text":"Havin lived in Vancouver for 10 years I dearly missed a great quality Izakaya - I tried a few in Montreal but none would come close to what I experienced in Vancouver. That is until I went to kinka izakaya!

Everything was fresh, delicious and made with high quality ingredients. Try the ebi mayo, tiger prawns in spicy mayo sauce; they are to die for! 
Don't miss the vegetable gioza made with onions and mushrooms. Great gomae with rapini! The mocchicino in sweet soya sauce was everything you expect of it: chewy and sweet at the same time.
The vegetarian bibimbap was good but my least favourite. I thought the cheese made it greasy and overpowering the rest of the ingredients. But that would not prevent me from coming back as there are plenty of other yummy dishes to try!

Great (loud) welcoming ambiance, you will be greeted Izakaya style! 
Modern decor with wooden Japanese chairs at the bar and communal tables great for groups. Friendly  service...
That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"I found this review that perfectly encapsulates my feeling about Kinka Izakaya:
\"This is awful place!
Owner is Korean and most of the workers are teens or early 20s college students who are inexperienced and unprofessional.
This place is so phony and fake.

Servers chew gum while working.
Japanese servers cannot speak French and even good English.
Food is not good. It is unreal Japanese food.

It is just waste of money!!!!!
Just don't go to this restaurant!!!!!\""}
{"text":"My dad is a very hard man to impress, but he wouldn't stop talking about how much he loves this place. Even my mom was in love with Kinka Izakaya. Too bad I couldn't eat there because I'm a minor, but I could tell that they are very excited to bring me there once I turn 18. They loved the environnement, the big space and especially the workers and their unique way of greeting people. Good job."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant since I have only had great dining experiences at Guu Izakaya in Toronto and was told it was the same owners.

Kinka needs to step up their game if they want to survive in downtown Montreal.  I will start with the positives.  The waitress provided great service and was knowledgable of the menu.  Beer was good and the udon noodle with beef and mushroom was very good.  

The fish tacos I was served was a mistake.  The taco shell was dry and cold.  The onion cold slaw was cold and the fried fish was warm...very strange temperature for a taco and terrible shell. My friend did not eat half the taco shell because of bad aftertaste.   The beef short ribs were served cold and dry.  It lacked flavored and appeared to have been cooked the day before.  Finally the octopus wasabi paled in comparison to the version served at Guu Izakaya.  

They need to improve execution.  They also need to rethink a few of the dishes.  At the end of the dinner I gave my feedback to the waitress.  She apologized and removed the tacos and Beef ribs from the bill.  Very good gesture.   I hope the manager takes the feedback and fixes the problems.  Kazu and Idamake are much better choices."}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya (pub) is themed after Japan's izakayas where every client is greeted with a loud welcome. Located on St-Catherine near Guy Concordia, it's location would be perfect to start off a bar hop. Classy, modern and loud, it initiates its customers to the night that is still young.

I had: 
- Green tea ice cream and its crème brulée which wasn't very creamy. It was too dense. I'm pretty picky about Crème brulée. 
- Take: Melon liqueur, white wine (my sensitivity to alcohol is very high - there was no alcohol at all, tasted like aloe vera though haha)

I would go back:
For a drink to start off a bar hop
A late night snack-and-drink
Kinka Izakaya is best for:
Groups of 4-8 friends
An upbeat izakaya experience

{"text":"My favourite restaurant! I usually order the gyu carpaccio, sashimi salad, salmon sushi, tuna tartar and the delicious baked oysters. Had their april's special ragout tripe last night and it was ok. Not as amazing and barely any tripe. Otherwise service is usually good and food is always spectacular."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. The food was not what I expected. I ordered the Yaki Udon, big mistake! So salty that I had to drink my water plus my boyfriend's after the first bite. The beef carpaccio is so small that even my chihuahua would be hungry after eating it. And the karrage  is supposed to be crispy. Forget it. It feels like they fried it and THEN put it in the microwave when someone is ready to order. Also. The salad they put in the plate is disgusting. Either they let the chicken way too long on it or it was borderline ready to kill itself but it was not appealing. And the service. Gosh. We waited at least 25 mins between every plate that we had ordered. So service not good. Food not good. Experience. Not good."}
{"text":"Great service, very fast. Good variety of options. Loud and vibrant atmosphere in keeping with the Japanese Izakaya theme. 

Bring the pumpkin egg back on the menu! Used to order that all the time and it has been taken down recently."}
{"text":"Restaurant de type brasserie japonaise en plein coeur du centre-ville. Dès que l'on rentre au Kinka Izakaya, on est accueilli par les salutations des employés en japonais qui nous fait sentir comme si on rentrait chez des amis. 

Ce restaurant suit la formule plat à partager qui est de plus en plus populaire à Montréal et les portions de chaque plat sont excellents. Que ce soit les brochettes de poulet, le riz dans un énorme bol en pierre ou les sakes bombs, tout y est délicieux. 

Le service y est excellent et tous les serveurs sont prêts à répondre à vos questions."}
{"text":"I knew we were going to have a good experience here the moment the staff greeted us with their welcoming yells. The atmosphere was friendly and especially lively since it was a Friday night, and though it was super cold outside, there were still a few tables left. 

We sat at the bar, where the service was great all night. The staff were helpful, and we got our food pretty quickly relative to the amount of people in the restaurant. We ordered takoyaki and wagyu sushi for appetizers, which were both delicious. The server recommended the sushi, which is apparently pretty popular right now. Both the unagi bibimbap and shoyu ramen were great, though unagi is my favourite so I may be a bit biased. Lastly, we got the black sesame ice cream to end. What a perfect dinner! I'll definitely be coming back to see what other dishes and drinks they have in store! :)"}
{"text":"It's a party in here! Arriving at 6pm because our first choice had a line out the door, we were seated promptly upon arrival. Tables were full with several birthday parties, but we were seated at the bar, which was nice since it was much easier to hear each other over the yelling (from many, many sake bombs) and loud music. 

Started the evening with drinks. The beer mojito peaked my interest most and I thought it was okay. They may have muddled the mint a little too much since it gave a bitter aftertaste, but otherwise, a nice little concoction there. My friend got the Nama Grapefruit Sour. It's intriguing that you get to juice your own grapefruit, but at least you know it's fresh juice and you're free to moderate how much juice to add. 

For food, we got a few things to share: Zuke Maguro (special menu item), Unagi Bibimbap, Tebasaki, Salmon Tataki and Hojicha Pudding. Most of the dishes were on the sweeter side, but most likely modified to match the Canadian palate. Patrons of this establishment were mixed, but definitely the party type. Music was bumping, many birthdays were celebrated and they do sake bombs in buckets. Yeah...buckets! Lot of yelling, words of encouragement and cheering was involved, but quite a lively atmosphere.

As we finished up, Kinka drew quite the crowd with a full house inside and on the patio deck. I suggest making a reservation if you can and if you want to party it up, the sake bombs are such a show!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and I can say that the customer service is EXCELLENT. The food is perfectly cooked, well laid out, etc.

The only thing I don't understand is why they're trying to change things up at this izakaya. I mean, I ordered the chicken that is supposed to be breaded and fried and not come with any sauce to ruin its crispiness and some pink Pepto-Bismol-like sauce covered the entire thing, making it all mushy and gross. It didn't taste bad, but it ruined what the chicken was all about -- crispy and marinated in soya sauce with sesame oil.

I also ordered the ramen and found it way too greasy.

The creme brulee matcha was delicious however.. and I wanted to try the cheesecake but I saw it come out and it looked more like an American cheesecake than a true Japanese one.

I'd come back, but it's kind of a hit and miss at this place. They ALMOST get the dishes right, and then it's too greasy or there's some weird sauce somewhere. We'll see. I'll give them a third chance.

LOVE the customer service though. They're so friendly, truly Japanese, very nice, and are very kind."}
{"text":"Aimez-vous les ramens ? aimez-vous les décors funky ?

Kinka Izakaya est pour vous ! Accueillis à l'entrée par un cri étranger, vous serez rapidement emmitouflés dans une ambiance d'ailleurs. Les murs asymétriques en bois de grange et l'odeur de viande grésillante m'ont immédiatement donné le sourire. 

Que dire des soupes ? DÉLICIEUSES ! le bouillon miso est juste délicieux et les dumplings également. Nous nous y sommes rendus pour la St-Jean et ils avaient préparé un drink bien sucré aux couleurs du drapeau Québécois, cute!

Définitivement à réessayer."}
{"text":"Cool ambiance, good place to have a bite and a drink. Was a bit disappointed because I Wanted to try out their plum wine based cocktails but they had none left so half of the drinks were unavailable. Other drinks were good, not very complex though. Sake mojito was very nice and refreshing. Food is good although by the time you get around to it it's already lukewarm. We had the sashimi salad which was good, nice wasabi based dressing. The beef tataki was good also. The best was the baked oysters. A hit. Service was ok! Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Traveler who found this place though yelp. Many of the menus were Korean food cooked in Japanese style. Tried Bibimbob, ahi salad, fried chicken. Bibimbob and Ahi salad was very good , fried chicken was average. Ice cold beer is must with these food. Excellent service despite we visited the restaurant 30 min prior to closing."}
{"text":"Sake bombs are so annoying and the music is so loud that any date would result uninteresting. I kind of liked the cheesy ramen but I think the plates are generally overpriced for the amount and quality of ingredients offered. It is just okay: nothing I would not find anywhere else, except by a horrible service provided by that old Japanese lady who asked for my ID in order to enter the establishment, even when I was not planning to order alcohol. I ended up leaving the second (and last) time I went. Your type of restaurant if you are already drunk and looking for some strenuous noise and an unjustifiable bankrupt."}
{"text":"Ce nouveau née de la tendance forte des bistros japonais à Montréal, est déjà pour moi un resto ou je vais revenir encore et encore. J'y suis entré totalement épuisé j'en suis ressorti plein d'énergie !!!!

Je n'ai pas l'habitude de critiquer un endroit après une seul visite. Mais bon il y a seulement les imbéciles qui ne change jamais d'idée. 
Kinka peu se traduire librement par Maison (Ka) dorée (Kin). L'endroit est superbement aménagé, contoir de granite; faux plafond en chêne (il me semble); bancs et tables en bois véritable; mur recouvert de fausse brique noir; cuisine ouverte..... Le service y est attentionné et c'est bruyant à souhait. 
Lors de ma première visite,
J'y ai mangé :
Okonomiyaki / cette crêpe japonaise frite avec quelque morceaux de pieuvre fut excellent. Quoi que la pieuvre n'était pas très présente, le contraste entre l'extérieur bien croustillant et l'intérieur moelleux en fait déjà un incontournable. Le dosage de sauce tonkatsu et de mayonnaise était parfait.
Kakuni / un morceaux de rôti de porc braisé goûteux et bien gras, servi avec de la purée de pomme de terre et un 1/2 uf à la coque. Ce fut une surprise agréable. C'est un peu trop gras pour moi mais l'hiver on peu bien se permettre ça. Il y avait un peu de la cuisine à maman la dedans :-) !
Takoyaki / les boulettes de pieuvre frite sont un classique des Izakayas. Elles furent à la hauteur.
J'y ai bu :
Ume Mojito / Mojito fait avec du vin de prune et du rhum blanc. La lime et la mente fraîches s'harmonisent bien avec les alcools pour en faire un cocktail goûteux et rafraîchissant. 

Pourquoi 4/5 : C'est simple pour moi jusqu'à présent aucun Isakaya de Montréal n'arrive au niveau du GUU Izakaya de Toronto. Mais le Kinka et le Imadake sont les meilleurs Izakaya à Montréal. J'en suis ressorti plein d'énergie après une longue journée à flâner dans la ville.  Mission accomplie!  On y retourne encore et encore pour essayer tout ce qu'il y a sur le menu! 

P.S. : Le WIFI de Juliette et Chocolat voisin y fonctionne très bien ;-)"}
{"text":"Cool Japan here we are! different from other homey Izakaya bars, Kinka shows us the stylish aspect of Japanese culinary culture. Beautiful presenting dishes, perfectly equipped toilette(prob. best place to feel Japan in Montreal), careful service, well designed interior.

Attention! you should know that this place is hyper noisy! almost like eating in the club."}
{"text":"If you don't like/know what tapas are or what an Izakaya is, I can explain it for you! Izakaya is the Japanese term for a restaurant that serves tapas. Tapas are small appetizers that you order. Rather than ordering one dish. You order multiple dishes for yourself or to share. I came here for a friend's birthday. This is a great place to celebrate one's birthday because they offer drink deals for groups. If you ever want to try a sake bomb, this is the place to try it. The waitresses scream \"When I say SAKE, you say BOMB\". This goes on for about 4 times; meanwhile everyone is hitting the table so that the shot of sake that is balanced on chopsticks can fall into the glass. We didn't get sake bombs; however, our entire group managed to try a lot of the different foods that they offered on the menu. I ordered the okonomiyaki, which is a Japanese pan fried pancake with vegetable and octopus, and a mackerel and tuna tartare that you roll in seaweed. It was pretty good! Make sure you eat the okonomiyaki when it's hot! We waited until everyone received their food and by the time we all received our food, the pancake was slightly cold. It was decent. I usually only eat authentic Japanese food, and the food here was pretty good. It wasn't super authentic, but it was still Japanese food. They also have a very typical Japanese atmosphere with the employees yelling 'Welcome' in Japanese. The menu items were decently priced. Some items were a bit overpriced. My meal came to about $15, which was good considering on the amount of food I got. Overall, this was a decent restaurant if you want to eat Japanese food!"}
{"text":"I decided to try Kinka on a whim. As someone who is not very familiar with Japanese pubs, I was curious to try some of the \"Japanese\" drinks (yuzu sangria, plum liquor) which were tasty and unique. I had some tapas as well, which I found spot on. The meat was grilled and flavored to perfection. 

The atmosphere at Kinka is very lively and hyped. When I entered with my friend, the hostess said a greeting and the entire staff cheered in response, and for sake bombs there is an entire ritual. It's a fun and high energy place to celebrate, but I wouldn't recommend it for a quiet and relaxing drink."}
{"text":"WE LOVE THIS PLACE! We usually sit at the bar where we can enjoy watching the chefs prepare the food. We have our favourites: KARUBI - grilled miso marinated beef short ribs that we share on the side. I usually get the NEO SHOYU RAMEN - the best ramen I have ever tasted so far! My boyfriend loves the YAKI UDON - pan fried udon noodles with beef, mushroom and scallion. 

I would also recommend trying the
UNAGI BIBIMBAP - rice , bbq water eel, durdock & egg in sizzling stone bowl.
KAKUNI - braised pork belly w/ boiled egg."}
{"text":"Great Japanese food but horrible service...there was no wait during dinner time on a weekend..which was amazing...as for the Toronto location..there is always a wait even on the weekday...

The food is great..authentic japanese food..but just horrible customer service......we had to ask for water for couple times by waving our hands even we were sitting right NEXT to the cashier station and the sushi bar...we definitely felt ignored the whole time...we had to ask for water...it took us 5 minutes to finally have an eye contact with one of waitress to get our check.....it really surprised me    the service this place provided as this is a Japanese restaurant...Japanese restaurant is usually known for its customer service.."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my experience at Kinka Izakaya. I was in the mood to try something new and went there for lunch. I really liked the decor and atmosphere. As I was alone, I was seated at the counter. The staff and service was perfect. I ordered their Takoyaki, Salmon Tataki, black sesame ice cream and Litchi juice everything was a-mazing and fresh (you could feel the quality of ingredients served). I will definitely be back to try the rest of their menu, they have gained a new aficionado :)"}
{"text":"In general it's good and the rice is superb - not too sticky nor too stiff. However, the bbq water eel is just too good to be enough and I really hope that they would serve it in a larger bowl and also in the full-piece instead of the chopped eel. LOL."}
{"text":"We did the tasting menu and everything was amazing! It was all cooked perfectly - couldn't have asked for a better lunch! The black sesame ice cream at the end was so different and good! Highly recommended this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but a little bit pricey. The portions were pretty small. The restaurant is usually crowded and loud on weekend nights. Good experience for people who want to drink and have fun."}
{"text":"Honestly the food aren't too good because its too saucy and overdipped or dry. I like the karaage but one of the plate thay I took tasted like ketchup, prices aren't worth for the food. Maybe i had a high expectation because of the reviews but not a big fan of the food there.

 Although drinks are on the contrary. I love the birthday bomb! It's a good place with a group of friends because of the atmosphere but If you go there, in my opinion, its to drink and not to eat!"}
{"text":"We heard of this new place, so my husband and I decided to check it out on a wednesday night. It was pretty full and loud! Great atmosphere. We sat at the bar which was fun because it was like sitting in the kitchen with the chefs!

Staff was friendly and food was good!
We shared 5 plates and a dessert, total with tax and tip was 70$
Not bad at all if you ask me!

Def going back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! It was our first visit, so we chose  the tasting menu, in order to get a general idea of the restaurant. Every dish was amazing! The eel bibimbap was probably the best bibimbap I've ever had. I also loved the ambiance and thought that the staff makes you feel super welcome. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"To say that Kinka has a unique atmosphere among restaurants would be underselling it, you gotta try going there when the restaurant is crowded and flowing with hectic activity as the staff yells on welcoming guests and for orders, gotta see it to experience it!

Kinka Izakaya is also great for some quality food, although a lot of dishes (Except maybe the ramen) are not super filling for their price. It's still really yummy though!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The decor inside is really nice and clean. The service is always great, really friendly staff that is always smiling. The food is also really tasty and at reasonable prices. I would definitely recommended this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Conveniently located, better than average Japanese izakaya with normally good food and reasonable prices. Nevertheless sometime chefs could be a bit greedy with the ingredients such aa a yaki udon with only 4 small pieces of beef and almost invisible amount of mushroom and scallion (see photo)"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch after some shopping along St. Catharine's.  We were all quite hungry so were pleasantly surprised when we got a table immediately, mind you it was about 1:30 in the afternoon so we probably beat the lunch rush.  The staff are courteous and attentive but not too attentive and the ambience is nice. It looks like it would be a fun izakaya place at night. 

We each ordered the ramen set. The ramen set consisted of ramen (I believe it was shio ramen) and a side of vegetable tempura over rice with a teriyaki sauce. There was so much food and all of it was delicious!  The ramen was cooked perfectly and the broth was perfect. I have been to many ramen places where the broth was way too salty and Kinka is not one of those places. The vegetables were deep fried in a little bit of batter and drizzled with a teriyaki sauce. Mixing the teriyaki sauce with the rice and eating it with the deep fried vegetables was heaven.  

The next time I am in Montreal I will be sure to stop in at night to experience the izakaya experience Kinka has to offer."}
{"text":"One of the best izakaya's in town. So many delicious tapas to share with friends over some nice cocktails. The ambience is great if you like loud places. One of the must takes on the menu is their okonomiyaki, sashimi salad, saba sushi and unagi bibimbap. They also have a daily menu that changes all the place."}
{"text":"First off, the staff is amazing!! They're all so upbeat and attentive. It's so much fun there. They're yelling out different things constantly, whether it's your order, welcoming you to the restaurant, or to get Saki bombs. It's tapas style so you can try many things. Our favorite was the torched salmon sushi. It was the best!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to kinka several times. The food and service were good and consistent. This time my friend and I ordered beef tartare, unagi bimbimbap, seaweed and tofu salad, tako wasabi and a matcha cheesecake. We enjoyed the food very much. One thing was that we didn't feel like putting out coats in the closet because there were a lot of similar coats, but we could not really find a place to put out clothes when we were inside."}
{"text":"My friends and I walked in being greeted loudly by workers which is always cool. I've been to Guu and various Izakayas in Toronto, so seeing it in montreal brings back nice memories. 

I got the Sakura cocktail, and it was decent. Very sweet though - which I like. Our dishes included Takoyaki, assorted sashimi salad, tuna tartar, fried chicken + mayo, tuna steak, wasabi octopus, pumpkin puree with red bean ice cream and mochi, green tea creme brulee. 

My favourite was the pumpkin puree dessert and takoyaki. My friends were the tuna tartar and assorted sashimi salad. In terms of consistency, the wasabi octopus was very on par. However, I was susprised with a few of our other dishes like the tuna steak. The tuna steak was definitely cooked too much on the outside. From what my friend had said, it was not like the one he tried earlier in the week when he came to eat. The other dishes were fine though. Portion sizes are always a little smaller than usual restaurants, but this is because its more of a snack restaurant. Nonetheless, I went home quite full!

 The place definitely offers fresh food in comparison to other japanese restaurants in montreal. But not as fresh as what I had expected. Perhaps this justifies a second visit in the near future for me. I definitely recommend a visit though. Service was pretty good, our waittress came by regularly and was courteous. The decor is done very nicely ; I always like taking a visit to the washrooms. It offers use of mouthwash. Overall, we left with a loud farewell from the staff and a wave good bye to end the night."}
{"text":"Un restaurant de tapas japonais incroyable ! J'ai adoré mon experience ! Nous sommes allé à ce restaurant pour la fête de ma copine avec un autre couple d'amis et ce fut un soirée incroyable !

Tout les employés sont gentil et ils acceuille tous le monde en criant  et te disent au revoir ensemble ! L'experience est vraiment cool !

Pour la fête de ma blonde nous avons commandé un sake bombe de trois étage ! Tout le monde lui a chanté bonne fete et ils apportent un tableau avec le nom de la fêté pour faire un photo boot ! 

Je le repete la bouffe est excellente

Nous allons y retourner c'est certain !

Une note parfait pour ce resto"}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya would be fun if you're in your 20's and want to party, but I'm an older guy and didn't enjoy it. The staff was nice enough but they yelled at the top of their lungs--constantly. They yell when you walk in, they yell your order to the cooks, the cooks yell back, they yell when they're standing next to you. It was non-stop. Five minutes after I placed my order, I couldn't wait to get out of there. To be fair, izakaya restaurants in Japan often call out their orders, but the yelling I experienced here was over the top and hurt my ears.  

As for the food, it was prepared carefully and seemed mostly authentic. The only problem was that everything tasted sweet (seafood salad, agedashi tofu, gindara). I don't understand why any chef would want to hide the flavors of good ingredients that way.

They are obviously trying hard and it wouldn't take much to be the best in the area. All they need to do is tone down the ridiculous yelling and stop trying to improve (localize) original Japanese recipes. It wouldn't hurt to add shochu to the drink menu, too."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, delicious, authentic food, very stylish with a great ambience. This is my go-to Izakaya in Montreal. I love the people here, I love the attention to detail, Kinka is a beautiful looking place, and the quality of the food is top notch. It's a little pricy, but I feel the staff really works hard, makes sure you're enjoying yourself, they have a great attitude, and that's what keeps me coming back.

I had a very similar experience at Guu in Toronto, the owners are restauranteurs in the truest sense of the word.

Highly recommended. This place is here to stay."}
{"text":"This place is now my new favorite for me and my bf. We now go every sunday for dinner. Food is excellent and service is fast and impeccable.  If it's your first time try the oyster, beef carpaccio if its on the menu of the day, the Kimchi soup!!  Reservation a must on Friday and Saturday"}
{"text":"Went here half a year ago and asked the waitress for some of their recommended dishes and their sashimi items were pretty good. Everything else was more just bar and drinking food. It's definitely a cool place to be to hang out with some friends. Their selections of sake bombs are crazy. We all got this 3 level sake bomb with a shot on top, then a cup, then a bowl! I don't even know what was in it."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than being greeted by every single employee waving and yelling as you walk through the door #celebritystatus that's when I knew I loved the atmosphere.

To top it off the food is also amazing, we got a couple of different dishes and I can't say there was one I wouldn't order again. The salmon sushi, octopus balls, beef shanghai noodles and dumpling soup were all tasty in their own way. 

We also got the grapefruit cocktail to start and our lovely waitress freshly squeezed it in front of us.

I would definitely recommend Kinka Izakaya for the food, atmosphere and the service!"}
{"text":"We got the tasting menu and it was superb. More than enough food for two people. 

The drinks were creative and had great daily specials. Each course came out at the perfect time and was cooked perfectly. 

The waiting staff was above average and attentive to our every need. I would recommend this place to friends, for a casual weekday dinner."}
{"text":"We actually loved the atmosphere and the decor, great for a Friday night! Decent amount of veg choices and excellent service! The food was good, but to be honest, it did not blow our minds. We had the vegetable gyoza, the pumpkin croquette, the vegetable bimbimbap, and the green tea crème brulée. It was a great experience overall, but I think we will be trying other places before coming back."}
{"text":"Good service and a fun atmosphere. I had the black miso cod and black sesame rapini. Everything was a bit too salty but it was yummy."}
{"text":"We ordered quite a few things : Karage, Gyu Capaccio, Edamame, TakoYaki, and marinated short ribs. Everything comes out very fresh! ...fresh to the point of burning your tongue if you're too eager . 

My favorite out of all the orders was the gyu capaccio. I love raw food so the chewy, thin slices were mouth watering nom nom!! Second comes takoyaki! I wasn't a big fan of the karage - kind of over cooked/fried and nothing too special. Then mayo sauce went well with it though.

I probably wouldn't come back unless it's pre-bar time or nearby. The gyu capaccio, service, and ambience was what kept this review a 4 star."}
{"text":"The sushi I ordered took over an hour and a half to come. When I opened the containers the sushi was smushed together and fell apart. I was also promised extra sushi for the long wait but received 2 miso soups instead. On the phone I was told that the total price would come out to 63$ but I had to pay 73$ because there was \"an extra charge for making a special spider roll.\" I would not recommend ordering from this place."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is gorgeous! Bamboo sake is awesome! The food was great, not wow as expected. The black cod that I use to like the most was not good. I ordered a salads that supposed to come first but they bring at last minute that we were at point to leave... very disappointed..."}
{"text":"The food here was only ok compared to other izakayas ive visited. The ketchup squid is one to avoid. Generally, most of the dishes are a bit overly seasoned. Prices are about the same as other similar restaurants. I was expecting to be blown away by the food but was a bit dissapointed."}
{"text":"Great place to bring a group of friends to drink and eat! Lively atmosphere, friendly staff, and decent food! Would come again! 

Atmosphere: 5/5  I have to say the vibes of this place is really bumping, very lively, very young crowd. It is always fun hearing the staff yell out \"Sake Bombs\" whenever a customer orders one, really brightens up the place. Great place to come too if you are looking for a fun time, I guarantee you. Great music too! 

Food: 3.5/5 I tried their first taster menu, wonderful, every single dish went well together, and order was superb. However, their fish could be improved or replaced, I wasn't a big fan. However their 2nd dish on their taster menu, the bean salad was amazing! In addition, I really enjoyed their black sesame ice cream. It actually made me seek out black sesame ice cream the next day at the store. 

Price: 3.5/5 If you are going with a group and going to be drinking for a while, expect to pay a bit. It isn't that cheap of a place. 

Overall, would come again with a group of friends for the vibes, the sake bombs, and food. That will foster good memories."}
{"text":"I went here with two friends and had a fantastic time. Everything we ate was excellent, and so was the service. I definitely recommend coming with a group so you can try lots of things. The bill was also surprisingly reasonable, especially given that we'd had drinks."}
{"text":"We went there for my birthday and they had us share the table with other folks. If you're looking to have your private space don't expect too much. Food is okay, but not as flavourful as I would have expected it to be. We shared all the vegetarian plates on the menu - food was tasty but didn't have the wow factor. The place was sometimes too loud at moments, but festive at the same time. Servers are doing a great job at serving you and recommending options. Will I go again? Maybe, but I'll try other Asian places before."}
{"text":"ambiance super, déco super, cocktails supers. Ça fait voyager, on se croirait au japon. Ma reco: être 2 et se mettre au Bar, on y voit la cuisine et les plats passer ce qui donne une bonne idées de ce qui a l'air bon, aussi, ça arrive ultra chaud. ce qui est bon: les boulettes, les huitres, un peu tout honnêtement."}
{"text":"This place is SO awesome! Super fun ambiance and food is amaze. Came in around 9pm without a reservation and only had to wait ~15-20 min. 

We ordered Ramen, some fried shrimp appetizer, and sake bombs.....You can't come here and not get sake bombs, trust me

Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"J'ai beaucoup aimé mon repas dans ce resto. Les plats sont copieux et abordables, l'ambiance, le service, le soucis du détail et la propreté des lieux m'ont charmé. 
J'ai goûté au Mabo Men, au Karaage et au Shoyu Ramen. J'ai beaucoup aimé le goût relevé riche et parfumé de la sauce du Mabo Men. Les nouilles sont fermes et chewy, parfaites! Attention, c'est plutôt piquant!  Le poulet frit était tendre, croustillant et juteux. Le bouillon du Ramen était savoureux avec les mêmes nouilles. 
J'ai hâte d'y retourner en soirée.

{"text":"Not recommended if you want consistency. Stopped in on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was packed and busy!! Had a look at the menu and realized it wasn't a sushi bar like we thought, but decided to stay! It was sake flight night for the special. Placed our order: sake and sashimi, gyoza, and calamari. Seemed pretty easy for a Japanese restaurant. Waited forever to get the sake, while the people two tables down, who came in considerably later than we did, received their drinks. After 20 minutes, and asking the waitress to check on our order, we received the sake. Still zero food, although I watched the table behind us order two or three times from the menu, (it's like a tapas bar) and receive their food after about five minutes. Ditto for the table next to us. We received our sashimi, wayyyyy after we finished our sake flight (it was a combo). We received our gyoza about 20 minutes later. Still no calamari. Finally, we just gave up, left money for what we ate, and went next door to an amazing chocolate shop. Just visiting Montreal, so safe to say we won't be back. I do highly recommend Juliet and Chocolate next door."}
{"text":"Far from authentic Japanese. It is fusion Japanese mixed with Korean style. 
This place good for casual ramen and deep fried food... kind of young university students food in my opinion.
Even popular unagi bibimbap was way too sweet. 
Very disappointed and wasted of my time in Montreal."}
{"text":"the main advantage of this place is that they serve passable Japanese food much later at night than anywhere else. Secondly the Staff are very good. Drink specials are extremely economical. Don't forget it's became a place for drunk people to loudly display their drunkness. But we are right beside a university. Another plus is that this place has a tremendously better decor and food than the competition.  So really this is your best choice for Japanese after 10 in the whole of the province of Quebec."}
{"text":"My favourite Japanese restaurant/bar. Can be pricey but worth every penny. The ambiance is energetic and vibrant, the staff is prompt, courteous and knowledgeable of their menu.

I would suggest to order this way: Order 2-3 plates per persons and then as you taste and contemplate the size of your meal order more as you please. Don't worry, the service is really fast.

The only dish I could not stomach was the takowasabi. It's a small bowl of slimy octopus bits in a marinade of wasabi. I love wasabi. (I also love horseradish, but that not the same thing) But, in this case, it tasted like cleaning products. Maybe if you are a true diehard fan of wasabi it can be your thing. But to me, no more.

But the rest was amazing! Of this round, my 3 stars goes to: In third place: The warm ozeki sake suggested by my server. Second place: The carpaccio of octopus and on first: The maguro dango soup, which is a dashi soup with tuna fish cake.

Go with friend, order all the places and don't forget the sake bomb!"}
{"text":"At old Faubourg, perfectly located.

Nice wooden decor but unfortunately windows are blocked with wooden decor. Not able to see anything outside. Felt a bit claustrophobic.

Initially service was good and quick, but later when restaurant got filled up, the service became super slow. To get our bill, it took almost 20 minutes. But our waitress was sweet.

Food was ordered from the lunch menu for two people: Vegetable Tempura, Salmon Tataki (including rice, Miso soup and Salad), and vegetables stuffed dumplings. The taste of all these dishes were average. It was super oily; I felt I ate more fat than the food. 

The prices were really reasonable for all these dish, as lunch menu was 30$ with tax and tips included. So that was wonderful."}
{"text":"On a rainy Tuesday night I was brought out for dinner I decided to not research where I was going and just let it be a surprise. 

It had a great vibe to it. It's much like imadake style but more clean and modern the bathrooms are huge and set up extremely well. All individual rooms and gorgeous unique sinks for each one. 

The waitress was helpful and understood what I was saying for the 7 items we picked. They have a lot more options then imadake. They have pork dumplings that come in a pot with tofu and veggies very good broth. Best fried chicken not greasy perfectly cooked. 

Drinks special 5-7 5 dollar drinks.

It's a great place to go, music loud place has low lighting not romantic but very relaxing and comfy. I would recommend calling for reservations as we came at 5 and by the time we left at 8 place was packed."}
{"text":"This is my happy place! 

Kinka never ever disappoints me. It consistently delivers on top quality service, ambiance, food and sake!

One of my favorite features is the daily special menu that is ever changing and always delicious. I love many of the menu staples; Ebimayo, karubi, okonomiyaki to name a few. 
The ramen specials are particularly lovely. Great flavour and well presented. Refined and authentic. 

Further, the Japanese tapas are never too costly and 40$ plus tax and tip can get you a lovely 3 course meal and sake! 

The Sayuri Nigori only runs for 19$ a bottle and is one of my favorites. 

This restaurant can get really loud. The decor is beautifully modern and cozy but the hard surfaces and number of clients can sure raise noise levels! One of my criteria for a well done food venue is the bathroom and Kinka has some to write home about. 

This is definitely one of my go-to restaurants in town and one of my top recommendations- the best izakaya in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Always crowded but its worth the wait! The food is delicious and the portions are okay. Price is average!
Went there a couple of times with my girlfriend and its definitely one of her favorite place to eat. 
The hostess was a bit rude last time we went there but it is probably due to the long lineup.
We were sitting at the bar and the cook were yelling directly in our ears but it was okay and part of the ambiance. We are used to Izakaya and used to this kind if greating."}
{"text":"Kinka Izayaka is a japanese restaurant that mostly serve small tapas. If you like to drink and eat, that's the perfect destination for you. The ambiance is great and festive and they have a great variety of cocktails, beers and sake! They also have daily special for the drink, which is pretty nice since you can try out drinks for a cheaper price. On Thursday, you can get a sake bomb for 3$! As for the menu, if you're more visual and you're not very familiar with Japanese food, you might want to look up on Yelp to see what the food looks like since there's no pictures on the menu. I always order the sashimi tartar and so far, I'm never disappointed! (I went there 3 times) That time, I also ordered the salmon sashimi with rice and it was ok. It could have been better though. Other than that, I would probably come back!"}
{"text":"Wow the service here is phenomenal!! We went here for a birthday and the service we received when we ordered the birthday special was something that we'll never forget. Food is also very good. Good memories!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the energy of this place! The drinks were good and the sale bomb was fun. They had good happy hour specials too. I had a Salmon Tataki and it wasn't the best. The skin was still on, which may be normal but I've never had it that way. Overall I'd definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Overall experience was very good ! The staff were super friendly and the food was too my liking. However, they didn't have any choices for ramen noodles which was my craving at the moment. I ended going for the calamari calamari and it was very yummy :) I highly recommend this place because of its great service and the green tea flavoured creme brule"}
{"text":"My favourite Japanese restaurant in town, love the ramen and sashimi salad, always go with these two dishes and add different dishes each time. The service is always good, it's better to make reservation on weekend."}
{"text":"There are a lot of problems with Kinka Izakaya. It's really, really loud. This is a taste thing, sure, but be aware. The staff is more concerned with watching the door so they know when to start yelling than they are with serving you (the entire staff yells together every time anyone enters or leaves... and everytime someone orders something... and intermittently between that). We probably waited 20 minutes without anyone serving us (not even drinks) before we waved a server over, and the restaurant was less than half full. All the servers seemed to be serving all of the tables at once, and we had to repeatedly stop different wait staff from clearing dishes we were still eating from. 

Then there's the food... which was not good. The best thing we had was the black cod, which was nicely cooked even if the skin remained a little soggy. The tasting menu comes also with: salmon tataki, which seemed overly sweet and not the best fish quality, fried chicken, which was fine but could have been bought at any fast food place frankly, marinated beef ribs, which had tasty fat but had been overcooked, and a marinated rapini in a black sesame sauce which was actually ok. The worst two dishes we had were the bibimbap, which was dull and gray and like eating a bowl of mud, and the \"tofu salad\" which is a limp lettuce salad doused in soy sauce featuring six 1cmx1cm cubes of unflavored raw soft tofu. We left these mostly untouched.

The meal finished with an ice cream of your choice, but we were pretty ready to leave before that point had come.

So, if you're in a large group and you want to get yelled at all night and obliterated on sake, this place is probably the right place, but it's not a place to eat."}
{"text":"I came for dinner on Nov 16th. The food is great, but the price is a little higher for the dish size. 
The salad is good, only a little bit salty for me. 
The black cod is juicy and fresh. 
Baked oyster is really yummy. 
The ramen is also good, only too much oil for me. 
The desserts are really great, are really worth tasting.
By the way, you may feel a little noisy when dine-in."}
{"text":"Take all of my money! Just take it! This place is seriously good. I went here twice and I was not disappointed. Their okonamiyaki (feel free to correct my spelling!) was the best! And I loved their tacos and raw dishes like tartare, tuna tataki etc. I ordered one cocktail which was the sakura (red wine, 7up...etc) and I was in love. It tasted to me like a shirley temple, but with an extra twist! Service was attentive and friendly. They yell at you, in a good way, when you arrive AND when you leave. How special! You definitely feel the love. I am really excited and happy about this new izakaya located in downtown. 

I really recommend coming here for drinks/tapas if you are in the guy area. I  am totalllly coming back again."}
{"text":"Typical IZAKAYA. Food was ok, best plates were the shrimps with spicy mayo, the fried chicken and the grilled fish. For 40$ per person you get a tasting menu with different popular menu items, very good value. Beer is cold and delicious. It's a loud place, don't go there on a date... this is a place to have a bite and drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Mon izakaya préféré à Montréal ! Tout à fais sublimes l'ambiance est trop génial le décor sur la coche et le menu boissson est super cool ! La bouffe me surprends toujours , j'essaie aussi les spéciaux du jours questions de faire changement ! Sur la photo c'est le tofu"}
{"text":"Overall value is good great atmosphere, great staff and just amazing decor. Maybe they need to find a signature original dish that will really differentiate them and draw people although location is excellent"}
{"text":"Had the unagi rice bowl and the beef ribs. Everything was really good but the oolong iced tea was really watered down. Will definitely go here again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"We went to dinner at Kinka Izakaya earlier this week. We were welcomed like a camp family; the hostess yelled something out and all of the other employees (chefs, cooks, servers, bar tender, everybody) boisterously responded in a cheer camp sort of way. It was the same sort of thing when we finished and left. Everyone shouted, smiled, and waved to us.

The decor is youthful, hip, and friendly. The music is trendy. It was fun for me, but I wouldn't bring my grandparents.

Kinka Izakaya has a regular menu; however, we ordered nearly entirely from the special menu plus two orders of spare ribs. M loved those spare ribs. I loved the octopus and tuna tartar.

We really enjoyed our experience at Kinka Izakaya. It was chill, fun, and delicious. We'd love to return."}
{"text":"Kinks will always be a safeplace for great food and ambience.Come here for authentic delicious food.They wont have gyu tann,but will have ramen,takoyaki,karasge"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun evening with friends to share some good Japanese food in a lively environment than this is the place to go to. This trendy spot is located in the faubourg and definitely brings life to the area. I I recommend the sharing menu which permits everyone to sample many of their wonderful dishes. The service is great and friendly. The whole experience is not complete without ordering  their sake bomb drink which is super cool. Once this drink is brought to your table the waiter and your table will begin to chant sake bomb which creates a super fun ambiance!"}
{"text":"Wow what an amazing place with great energy!
Food was amazing, super tasty and fresh. The oyster and the ribs was indescribable good!!! The deep fried check and the panko shrimps also well done.
The always do like in Japan, welcome and say bye to everyone that come in or leaves. When you get a Sake cold shot, they also make a huge noise that makes it very funny!
Loved the atmosphere, service and inside is very classy. And about the food, well I guess I don't need to repeat how amazing it was!!!
I'm so glad my friend chose this restaurant for our dinner"}
{"text":"First time we are here....we are a little bite disappointed for the food....it's not that good like everybody was talking about...we order the special chicken ramen...the broth was too salty...and the other things too...a little bite too salty...but I like the atmosphere ...the service is ok....but the food need to improve...."}
{"text":"This Izakaya place which is linked to Guu Izakaya's empire, serving small plates and tasty rice and noodles dishes. Went there after work with a friend for a few pints of Sapporo and quick bites.

We ordered a pitcher of beer, the Tuna Tataki on the special menu, the (justifiably) famous Fried calamari, the Udon with Roe and Kimchi and the Unagi bibimbap. The Tataki was fresh, smokey, it was topped with smoked shishito pepper, and a mayo-based sauce. It was good but they could have dropped the mayo. The Unagi Bibimbap was definitely a Japanese interpretation of the Korean classic, With a strong seaweed and Unagi presence. It was deliciously succulent; however, the rice could have been a tad dryer. The calamari is one of Guu's most famous dish, and it is understandable why. It's amazing, sweet, crispy, spicy, creamy will be the best way to describe the bite. The Udon was also good, chewy, with the taste contrast between the kimchi and the fish roe in coating the noodles. 

Scored 40$ with drinks and a (generous) tip. Service was great tho."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere. nice place for hang out and enjoy fun time with friends.  Amazing food and great service! definitely wanna come back next time!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and the food is consistently good and tasty.  The sashimi salad is quite fresh and the beef tataki is very memorable in flavor, both my faves. It does get quite noisy at night but it's the unique/touristy Japanese bar environment. Expect to pay $35-55 on average and dishes are great to share to get more variety."}
{"text":"service très courtois et je vous conseille très fortement la soupe Végétarienne ne coute pas très chère et remplis de bon légumes. Les 2 \"tofu nuggets\" sont excellente!!

*juste un peu trop salé par contre, mais bon c'est des ramen alors on s'y attend!"}
{"text":"Si un atmosphere un peu bruyant ne vous dérange pas, je vous recommande d'y aller. Les plats typiques des pubs IZAKAYA y sont offerts et sont bons. Je vous recommande de reversez par téléphone."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner this past Saturday evening. The food was wonderful. We particularly enjoyed the sashimi, which was extremely fresh. The service during our meal was attentive and warm, but it was our post-meal experience that exceeded my expectations. I stupidly left my mobile phone at the restaurant and didn't realize it until the next morning. We live in upstate New York and had to head home before the restaurant opened. I called (using my wife's cell phone) and spoke with one of the staff members who appeared to take very copious notes as I described the situation. She then told me I could expect a call from a manager shortly. Sure enough, Yumeho Ikoma called and instructed me to simply email my contact details to her and she'd take care of it. This morning I received an email confirmation this morning that my phone is on the way. I truly appreciate the follow-up and follow-through, especially since it was my bad. High marks all the way around!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I can't believe it! They sell a bowl of rice under the name of Bibimbap!! For 9.9$!!!! It is nothing but rice and few mushrooms!!!"}
{"text":"Sat outside had really poor service, they forgot about the sushi we ordered it took an hour and a bit to receive it. They did give us 20% off our bill however so I'm not complaining. Foods excellent, I was at the one n Toronto last Friday and it was excellent, Unagi Bibimbap, Short Ribs , and the Blowtorched Salmon Sushi is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Although in a highly \"touristy\" spot, this place has pretty authentic Japanese dishes served in tapas-style proportions. The staff is very 'interactive' - they greet and bid adieu to everyone - and there are plenty of sake bomb chants going around i.e. this place is pretty happening. 

I just want to add: the washrooms are really nice."}
{"text":"I'm not from Montreal but always stop by Kinka Izakaya for lunch whenever I am in town
-for singles, you can eat at the counter
-staff is very friendly; all the employees say goodbye to you when you leave in traditional Japanese style
-I usually get the lunch special: Ramen (Pork) and Rice Plate (fried vegetable); it is great value. The rice plate is okay but the ramen broth and noodles are delicious. The pork is a little too lean for my taste but the broth makes up for it 
-bathrooms are clean and have listerine rinse
-about a 5 minute walk from the Guy Concordia metro station

Good place for lunch especially if you like Ramen"}
{"text":"amazing selection of food and drink, very fairly priced, very friendly service. They were extremely busy but still were on top of service, and even gave my husband a nice birthday surprise! I cant wait to go back here next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Amazing service, great ambience, the food is the best part. Love this place! Reasonable prices for the amount and quiality of food."}
{"text":"We went to Kinka for a casual dinner after a meeting at DT.
I ordered shoyu ramen, fried chicken and calpico sour vodka. My friend got a oolong vodka. 
Wednesday is not the busiest night, so the service was pretty fast and waiter is attentive.
Overall, food quality is ok but the portion was small, 5pieces of small fried chicken for about 8$ is not worth the price.
I like the calpico vodka a lot, calpico goes with everything, for the oolong vodka, the drink was tasteless. I would like to try some more drinks at Kinka next time."}
{"text":"It was one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Montreal, but this time it made me really disappointed. 
We went there around noon and ordered some food on the regular menu. The salmon oshizushi which is a special sushi. It served with salmon on top of the rice. I like the salmon but not the rice. The rice was not made fresh, I think they pre-made it and left it in fridge for the night. We asked the waitress about it and she didn't give us any answers, even after we asked for the check, I would only assume that she chose to forget about it.
I gave them one star is because there isn't an option for zero star."}
{"text":"I expected a lot more from Kinka but still had a decent and authentic Izakaya experience here. 

With so many items on the menu it was hard to decide on a few things and some items are bound to be underwhelming. The key is knowing just exactly what to get. Stick to the tried and true items. 

The highlight was the salmon tataki, and it seems the raw items are the safest picks here. But otherwise most items were fairly disappointing or just mediocre. I wouldn't exactly recommend the ebi mayo, or okonomiyaki (it's not exactly a pancake). The pressed sushi was okay but the rice was more mushy and vinegary than I expected, and the salmon just did not come through at all. 

The tofu salad was a big portion which was surprising, it was nice to have some greens for your meal. 

I did enjoy their own branded 'kinka' sake which was pretty good. It's a bitit of a shame we couldn't take the bottle home. 

Service was friendly and good here with no problems."}
{"text":"Ramen was good with rich flavour and nicely cooked noodles. I had the Miso Ramen (Vegetarian) and my dad had the Shoyu ramen. The service and atmosphere were unfortunately both not on par with the food. 

There were multiple tables open but they forced us to sit at the bar next to a very loud group of people. In fact, the entire restaurant is extremely noisy. Loud music and very loud staff, who are constantly yelling at one another or sometimes into thin air. Their birthday celebration song, which was performed more than once, is also at piercing volumes. 

They brought us one large mug of beer to share, which was odd. They offered to go back and split it for us. My fathers ramen came out and after 10 minutes, I inquired where mine was. They responded there was a mistake and it would be ready in 10 minutes. Instead of offering a solution, the waitress stood there, awaiting instruction. 

As I said, good food. Everything else in the restaurant was rather disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is ok. But this place is a bit expensive. We ordered a combo for 2 and ended up with a 150 dollar bill. But the good thing is you paid for a good service and good quality foods."}
{"text":"This place was a nice place to eat since they have the ramen which will warm you up when it's -8 degrees outside. They were very accommodating especially when they were full and we did not a have reservation, they still made space for us. Food was tasty. I would definitely visit again. Plus the price of the meal was great."}
{"text":"Came here after our first choice couldn't seat us for an hour. Once we entered all the staff greeted us in chorus which is pretty cool, the host seated us right away. The menu had numerous options, something for everyone. Our favorites were the fried chicken, grilled pork and ramen. The mojito Sapporo was pretty kick ass too. One unique thing about this place is that if you order sake shots, the wait staff cheers you on as you do your shots!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong with the three star review - I love Kinka, but the price of the food is a bit high compared to the amount of food you get. We got three dishes to share but as well as a ramen to share and came out with a $50+ bill and not full. 

Its definitely more of a drink place than a dinner place. I like their food but, I just wish they had more affordable prices."}
{"text":"Bel atmosphère. Avons apprécié ce que nous avons mangé mais sans plus. 
Le service se fait typiquement en anglais. Le personnel est chaleureux et accueillant. C'est bruyant car le principe est d'accueillir les gens avec des cris en japonais et la même chose quand on quitte. Ça donne un bel énergie. Il faut toutefois être dans cette ambiance."}
{"text":"Tried the kinka a table, which was 7 dishes for $29, for a party of two or more.

Food was delicious, the tuna sashimi had an amazing texture and smoky flavour. First time have lobster sashimi and surprisingly it has no flavour at all. Since there's no natural flavour and no exceptional texture, it doesn't make a great sashimi.
The rest of the food was very well crafted as well, with my complaint about the beef ribs being a bit too tough, and a scoop of ice cream for dessert was rather lacklustre. If I had to pay individually for each item, I don't think it'll be worth it.

The environment is the bomb! Sake bomb. 
You'll always hear people cheering/yelling throughout your dinner and it'll make you smile. Tons of fun sake on the menu. Stay away if you want an intimate conversation! You'll end up trying to yell in order to talk because they play loud music too.
Service was fast and courteous as well.
If you want a fun night out, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Montreal. It is truly one of a kind. You can tell everything is fresh and that your food came directly from the skillet based on its temperature. The baked oysters are out of this world! Also, their menu is delightfully original and includes everything from sushi to rice bowls to sake."}
{"text":"Been twice in 1 week, I rarely do that. Good food, hot pot rice bowls were super tasty, Vege choices were all perfect and flavorful."}
{"text":"They charge hidden price and didn't show on the invoice. Please count your bill before making payment"}
{"text":"Bien que le restaurant m'ait été présenté sous forme de restaurant à tapas, les portions \"tapas\" sont généreuses.
Ambiance dynamique mais parfois un peu trop bruyant.
Service inefficace et non chaleureux."}
{"text":"I'm not from Montreal, but my friends and I wanted Japanese food and we saw that this place has 4 stars, so we decided to have dinner here. I would give this a place a zero star if that option exists. We walk in and we're standing by the door for about 2 minutes before a server came up to us to serve us and other servers past by and saw us but didn't help even acknowledge us. There wasn't a table for us so we had to wait 20 minutes for one, nevertheless, we decided to wait. Don't get me wrong, the interior is very modern looking with their wooden tables and chairs and the food was good as well but the portions are very small. It's very noisy with all the yelling and screaming and the customer service here is very poor. After I asked our server for the bill, he went to the table in front of ours and asked for their order and it would be another 10 minutes before he comes back with the bill. This place needs to hire more staff, I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Very delicious tapas!  The menu is also in French and English so if you're from the states, you can still read the description. We ordered aburi chashu, ikapria and takowasabi. My advice- be. brave- try the takowasabi. You'll thank me later ;)."}
{"text":"GO TO IMADAKE INSTEAD!!! Worst service rude staff. Was told to be quiet even though the staff and other tables were constantly yelling.  Ordered multiple bottles of sake and beer and was told we couldn't keep our glasses and they were litteraly stolen off our table. 

Go to imadake instead so much better and consistent!

Will never being going back or recommending."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service, I love how they greet us when we entered the restaurant and told us goodbye as we left. The food is tasty, fresh and enough to share with two people. The menu is a bit difficult to navigate in the beginning but the server was able to help us with no problems. I definitely recommend this restaurant and will be visiting it in the near future."}
{"text":"Food was okay but didn't deserve a 4 star. The chicken wings were especially disappointing. The umami factor was lacking. This was nowhere near that. Miso black cod was pretty good though. 

Service was okay. 

The place was loud and great drinking environment. But not so much for foodies."}
{"text":"The only positive: good food. The downside: 45 minutes from when we were seated until they asked for our order. By the end of the night we were LITERALLY filling out own water after taking a pitcher from the serving station. NOT worth it."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a friend, the place is full of energy (as expected) friendly staff and prompt service. 
Thursdays special is the $3 sake bombs so of course we had to get one! 
The menu has numerous options, cold dishes, hot dishes, fried dishes, noodles and rice dishes
We were only 2 so we didn't order that much... first we had the Kakuni (pork belly and boiled egg) which was absolutely amazing. If you've read my other reviews you'd know that I love a well made pork belly, and this was good! Perfectly marinated, melts in your mouth perfection. I would give it 5 stars just for that. Then we had the Takoyaki (octopus balls), compared to the ones in Japan... not as good, but compared to the ones I've had in Montreal, they're pretty decent though I found it was a little too dense, but the outside was nice a and crispy. Next dish we had the Karaage (deep fried chicken) with garlic mayo dip. Not the best fried chicken I've had but it wasn't bad. Last dish we had was the Gindara (grilled miso marinated black cod). I usually love this dish but I found it to be a little too salty and I enjoyed it less than I expected, and I was really looking forward to it too! 
Overall the dishes were generally good, some amazing, and one fell a little short. The atmosphere is awesome, the staff are great too. There's still lots of dishes that I'd want to try, so I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Noodles.  Anyone that knows me knows that I have a noodle fetish.  Passing by I just had to get a quick fix in.  Luckily on a weekday around 2pm it was fairly empty.  It's a large space and when filled to capacity I can see how it would lively!

I ordered the albacore tuna and the pan fried udon noodles with beef/mushrooms.  Scarfed those babies down!  The tuna apparently according to the server is the most popular item - I can see why - fresh and light tasting but rich with flavour.  The noodles hit the late afternoon craving.

Service was a bit slow to start but picked up and everyone was very friendly- even advising patrons the kitchen was to close (closes at 3pm; reopens at 5pm) so if we wanted to place another order to do so now. 

Yes they have em in Toronto but when a craving hits you gotta indulge!"}
{"text":"Mon aventure culinaire fût mitigé. Pour avoir été au Kinka de Toronto il y a 3 jours. Celui de Montreal ne lui arrive pas a la cheville. En matiere de service et de qualité de la nourriture. UNE GRANDE DECEPTION! 

Les serveurs ne sont pas tres chaleureux et la nourriture est tres loin d'etre extra! 

Du potentiel mais c'est finalement une déception. Un conseil, si vous allez à Toronto! Essayez le Kinka là-bas!"}
{"text":"One day someone had eaten a lot of birthday, and the most delicious one was udon noodles. It was great. A lot of people are very noisy, this is the Japanese wine house."}
{"text":"Greeted by the whole staff when you walk through the door. The atmosphere is very lively. We got Sapporo, Shoyu Ramen, Salmon Oshizushi, and Sashimi Salad. The ramen tasted like most shoyu ramens, but it had green onions that were grilled/sautéed which gave it a smoky-ish taste which was a nice addition. The salmon also had a smoky/sweet taste to it. The salad was fresh and the sashimi in it was not too bad. Service is great and food came out quickly. They also take credit card."}
{"text":"Horrible service. On top of it I ask them if they can plot my phone and the girl wanted to plug in the floor where everyone walk, I tell her can you plog at the bar she told me there no plog...but I tell her yes I saw one ,then she just reply me : no the plog there is not for the costumer!! Anyways i will never go back there."}
{"text":"Came here on a trip to Montreal. The place is big and it's easy to get seated. 
We had:
sashimi salad- very good although they could have been more generous with the sashimi.
Yaki udon- beef and mushroom udon which was good.
We ask had the black cod which took 20 minutes to be served (waay after we had finished eating everything else) and it was nothing too special.

The time it took for the black cod took away from our experience. Overall 3."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Restaurants with sake bombs usually have a lively atmosphere and Kinka is no exception. The food here is also really good--  I personally loved the Unagi and Konoko bibimbaps, but there isn't anything I haven't liked here."}
{"text":"Tried the salmon oishi. It was ok the fish was a little fishy. Had better ones in Vancouver bc.
The ebimayo had too much sauce
Kakimayo nice and simple"}
{"text":"Very nice place, super friendly staff,
their grill saba was so so delicious and their rice with mushrooms in the hot pot are must.  Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This Japanese cuisine is next level. Every dish served was original and creative. Very palatable!"}
{"text":"If you have been to Guu in Toronto then you know what to expect at Kinka. 
The menu is Tapas style with a Japanese twist. You are greeted with the warm loud yell when entering the restaurant, the atmosphere is festive and inviting with nice blend of house and electronic in the background. The staff and service is excellent. 

Food on the menu is excellent regardless of what you order. Fresh, Creative and full of flavor. Make sure you order a big mug of Sapporo beer and try the Sake Mojito!!! The one great plus that Kinka has is the outdoor patio during the summer. I love how the patio is placed by the road and next to the couple of other restaurants with their patios also. It just make a great dining experience with friends before heading out on the town. Price of the food is not cheap but you pay for what you get and that is Quality. 

If you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner then do look elsewhere but if you are looking for a festive outing with friends then Kinka is a highly recommended place to go."}
{"text":"Similar to most of the reviews, we were a group of 10 and got a really poor service. They just bring out the plates and don't know to which person it belongs to. The check out was a nightmare as well. We had to go through the long bill and mark up which plates was ours (none of the server wanted to give us their pen?) and charged a gratuity of 18%. Honestly its ridiculous because there wasn't really any service provided (we had to ask for water, plates not coming out at same time for everyone and some waited a while, they even left the plates on the table and let us figure out to whom it belongs to, they gave us the bill and some of the plates were still missing). 

We didn't enjoyed the food much. The tuna tartare seems like it went into a blender and not handcut for example.

The only nice thing are the decorations and atmosphere. But the poor service will just ruin your night out if you are a big group."}
{"text":"Great food, good vibe! Very friendly staff, they will literally all greet you at the door as you walk in. This might be my new favourite Japanese spot in Montreal. I would recommend to anyone looking for a great experience. It can get a bit loud at times at peek hours, but nothing you can't talk over.

Full meal, drinks, and desert for 2 comes out to 60$ but well worth it.

Go ahead and give it a try."}
{"text":"The short of it is that this is an awesome spot with food that is not only beautiful looking but super tasty and affordable!

We wandered in here late night on a Friday after having driven several hours up to Montreal. Boy is this place LOUD. I don't know if it was just like everybody's birthday that night or what but this is one of the loudest places I've ever been. Everybody was yelling, and the staff had drums and huge chalkboards proclaiming birthdays, the table text to us did an organized chant-yell about sake bombs, like this was a very loud place that I assume nobody over 40 goes to. Though considering how packed and loud it was, there was no wait for a table which made everything seem a lot more manageable. 

We ordered the Kakuni (braised pork belly with mashed potato & boiled egg), Karubi (grilled miso marinated beef short ribs--probably the stand out dish), Ikapiri (deep fried calamari with spicy ketchup & wasabi mayo), and Veg Furai (yam fries and green bean tempura with honey mayo & matcha salt). Everything came out looking absolutely beautiful- I don't typically care about how my food looks when it's served, but I was genuinely impressed with their spread AND, more importantly, their portion sizes. Those four dishes were perfectly filling to share, plus we got some black sesame ice cream to wash it all down. 

A+, great first meal in Montreal and makes me a little sad I don't live closer. There were definitely some intense looking alcoholic drinks I'd be down to go back and try."}
{"text":"\"WHEN I SAY 'SAKE,' YOU SAY 'BOMB'! ... SAKE!\" 
\"BOMB!\" 
\"SAKE!\" 
\"BOMB!\"

If you cannot handle the above, perhaps Kinka Izakaya is not for you. But if you love the excitement of watching progressively drunker patrons slap tables (or participate yourself), you'll have a great time at this restaurant. JJ and I started our dinner off with a sake bomb each--I continued with a liter of Sapporo (a 'grande verre'), while he had another bomb. 

We also ordered sashimi salads, which were light but packed with protein from the fish. I ate my fill of the edamame, which was very salty (but not inedible), and we also had fried chicken, which was happily all dark meat.

I really liked the boisterous and busy atmosphere, and the food was the perfect start to our evening."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the price is okay and the service is good. I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food is good. Noisy place but the ambience is really fun. Great cocktails."}
{"text":"Super fun atmosphere! Great for birthday dinners or groups. The food was excellent and the staff is really nice. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I ate and drank here on a Friday night around 10 PM.  The prices are maybe a little high for what you get, but you are also paying for atmosphere and authenticity.  The cooks and servers are Japanese - all that's missing are call buttons and privacy screens at the tables.  

We ordered chicken nanban, kimchi udon, ebi mayo and salted mackerel, and were thoroughly impressed by all of them.  I got full before I got a chance to try their okonomiyaki sadly, but I was very happy with the food.  

The service was attentive and warm - rather un-Japanese to try and upsell the tasting menu and specialty cocktails, but I can't blame them.  

Music was loud repetitive house music and I heard some Parov Stellar.  Whoa."}
{"text":"Yah, it was ok. The service was friendly, easy going and prompt. My folks liked the food ok, they didn't know what to expect having never been to an izakaya so I was happy they weren't disappointed. I was happy to try a place I hadn't been to before but somehow I feel like I won't be drawn back. The flavours seemed a little off or flat and the sauces were a little... I dunno.. krafty? to me in the classic dishes like the okonomiyaki and the takoyaki. The karaage was super delicious so if I did end up there again I'd know what to order, and I loved the grapefruit cocktail I ordered as well. I guess I wanted it to taste more like loving home cooking and that's not quite what I got. Also, I'll be honest, I hadn't quite realized that this spot was in the Faubourg building and since I'd grown up hearing stories about the food safety situations that had passed through there over the years that gave me the creeps as well."}
{"text":"Highly energizing place! Servers and chefs alike shout greetings and farewells, and announce each serving from the counter, and - perhaps most uniquely - holler the \"sake bomb\" chants. 

The food is fresh and delicious, ranging from sashimis to karaages to ramens/udons /rice etc. Each order in small portions such that a couple can easily order 7-10 dishes in one dinner. The two cocktails we tried - Yuzu and Sake Sour - went very well with the dinner. 

If anyone is feeling down and wants to be reenergized in a cheerful, booming atmosphere, go to Kinka!"}
{"text":"Try the eel bibimbap. You won't regret. Trust me."}
{"text":"Visiting montreal for the weekend with friends walking down st cat's and happen to stumble upon the restaurant. After quickly checking yelp for reviews we decided to go in. From the entrance it looked like a pretty quite restaurant but as you walk in the atmosphere was completely different. The chefs and staff welcome you by saying some sort of phrase in which I assumed was Japanese and even though the place seemed busy we were seated quickly. The food was delicious!!! If you have been to places like Guu it is very similar. Our group of friends were looking for a place to get some Sake bombs. After doing one round, we did another and got our table neighbours to join us. Overall we all left feeling happy and satisfied with every rhing and would go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"PROS:
- Nice setting/decor
- Close to metro (Guy)
- Good drinks (altho very weak)

CONS:
- Awkward seating (no backs on the stools, nowhere to hang your jacket)
- Cost to food portion ratio is way off
- Waiters are uncoordinated

So my boyfriend wanted ramen and this place was the closest that was still open past 10pm. 
The ramen itself was very lackluster! He even said it tasted like 99c instant noodles.
We also had the honey bbq pork which wasn't even BBQ, just slabs of leathery meat...
We had the fried chicken with mayo-- the best thing all night.
And the beef ribs, which were alright.
For drinks I had the Sake Mojito: it tasted awesome but I'm skeptical about the amount of alcohol that was actually in it.

My main issue with this place is that the food was expensive and not worth it AT ALL."}
{"text":"Mmmm came here on Saturday night with an old friend and absolutely loved it! I've always loved izakaya style meals, and having small plates makes it so much easier to share and try different things. 

We came here on Saturday night around 7, and the wait list took about 30-45min without a reservation. The next time I come here, I'll make sure to call in beforehand since it's extremely busy on the weekends. When you walk inside, the entire restaurant greets you in typical Japanese fashion, and if it's your birthday, they do a loud song with a sign and sake bombs - making it a very public fair. Overall, I love the atmosphere, which is loud, fun and full of energy. I would definitely consider going to one of the Toronto branches for my birthday!

For drinks, we ordered the saketini, since all of the plum wine based drinks were sold out. The pitcher was $22 and was enough for 4 glasses (1 glass is $7.5, so you save about $10). 

We ordered 4 small plates in total, and were really full by the end. We ordered one of their specials, the salmon sashimi in sweet soy sauce and a hint of wasabi ($7.5), which was fresh and flavorful but quite small. We also ordered Kabocha Korroke, which are deep fried pumpkin croquettes with an egg baked in the middle ($6). This is vegetarian, and probably one of my favorite dishes. The texture of the pumpkin is like sticky rice, with a crispy outside layer. It's also quite big and filling for $6. We ordered the Kinoko Bibimbap ($9.8), which comes with rice in a sizzling stone bowl, mushrooms, cheddar cheese and seaweed sauce, which they mix together when served. This was also delicious, and quite large - far more than enough for 2 people. Lastly, we ordered the Saba Oshizushi ($12.8), the most expensive dish on our list. It came with 6 pieces of saba on top of square rice blocks. It was good, but maybe not worth the $13 we paid for it, since it was quite small. 

We finished with the green tea cheesecake for dessert ($6.5). It wasn't the fluffy Japanese cheescake consistency that we were expecting, but since both of us love cheesecake, we devoured it within minutes. 

Overall, we each paid about $44 after tax and tip, definitely not bad for how much alcohol and food we ate, as well as how much fun we had. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Montreal! It's also very close to the Guy-Concordia Metro Station on the Green line so it's easy to get to."}
{"text":"Amazing spot!
Great fun with all the Japanese calling it out all night.
Great food!
Great service !
Decent prices
Great for groups"}
{"text":"It was amazingly good  delicious ! I was sitting next to the bar and I could see all other dishes they all looked so good that I can't wait to go back and try something else ! About my order tho !! I ordered ramen and I loved it and it cost nothing !! Plus the staff where so welcoming and nice ! For sure I am gonna go back"}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant  is amazing from the decor to the quality.  The only reason I can't give it 4 stars as it takes forever to get a table without a reservation and when I tried calling the number supplied on yelp to make a reso  it seemed to be a fax number.  I ordered the tasters menu after the painful wait.  For 35$ it is priced fairly and the dishes supplied are a great representation  of what this restaurant has to offer.  I really enjoyed the baked oyster, my favourite out of the tasters menu, although all the dishes served were amazing.  I highly recommend  this place."}
{"text":"I would never come eat here again. Despite the food being OK, the service is egregious. The servers would neglect us and forget our drink and food orders, often repeatedly. we were told at the door that we would have to leave after two hours but let me tell you, with the snails' pace that they work at there is no way you could get out the door within two hours. After our meal they came back to ask us what we had ordered because they had everything confused for the billing!!! I'm sorry, but they should have written that down and the worse part was that we had to tip 18% because it was mandatory for a large group. After 2.5 hours at the restaurant we were still waiting for our bill (which they refused to divide individually - they insisted it was by groups of 4) and all of us had empty water glasses and beer glasses. The atmosphere is cramped and loud and the staff are bordering on clueless. Find another place to eat. I'm still waiting for my bill while I'm writing this......"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, vibe was great. Amazing for birthday parties, and the staff are so energetic! If you're looking for a night of good food, good drinks, loud music, this is it. Make sure to call and reserve early though, the whole time we were there it was crazy busy!"}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday, and just had a great light meal! The service is great, and once you enter and exit the place, the waiters shout out hi and bye(I think), but they shout out something which is really cute and shows their appreciation. 

We were 4 people, and shared everything like tapas, and although I'm not a huge Japanese food fan, I sure did become one after trying Kinka Izakaya's meals. Would suggest here, and its a nice experience if you want to try out some Japanese meal."}
{"text":"Maybe the best izakaya I have been to. The ambiance was so Japanese and the people were hilarious.  Order the sushi. Not one to miss."}
{"text":"Delicious cheese oyster and the special mapo rice is also highly recommended!! Very traditional Japanese style. Love it!"}
{"text":"Really fun place - with yummy, yummy food. I ordered the beef carpaccio and loved it so much, I ordered a second. Sake Bomb was fun, with the whole restaurant getting in on it, but, probably not delicious on its own. 

Would be happy to return!"}
{"text":"Headed to Montreal for a few days for our baby moon and turned to trusty old yelp to find a spot for dinner. I came across this restaurant from a recent yelper's review and the pictures caught my attention. 

Street parking only. The restaurant isn't that large, but it's not tiny either. Open kitchen concept w/ great ventilation bc we didn't leave stinky. Loud and energetic atmosphere. Be warned that this place is very loud and it gets louder when there's a birthday in the house. Staff and service are both friendly and fast (except for our server).  There are 4 clean separate restrooms stocked with toothpicks and mouthwash. Very busy on a Saturday night. The wait wasn't too long (10 mins) because we called ahead to be put on a waiting list.  

Hubby ordered a Sapporo mojito. He enjoyed his drink and commented on how nice and refreshing it was. 

For appetizers we ordered:

Tako Kalu - octopus carpaccio w/ spicy garlic dressing. This was on their special menu of the day. I wasn't impressed. The octopus was tender, but the flavors were a little too oniony. The sauce that was served with the octopus was a sweet and garlicky sriracha based sauce. Not my favorite. 

Tako wasabi - this was a tiny little dish, but packed a huge punch. I'm typically not a fan of wasabi, but this dish was well seasoned. The sauce element had a slimy texture which was odd, but not off pudding. The salt level was a tad heavy, but not inedible. This was served w toasted seaweed. Yum.

Kaki Mayo - OMG the BEST baked oysters I've ever tasted. Flavors were on point and everything just worked so well together. Perfect blend of cream, salt, spinach, and broiled cheese. WOW. The oysters were ginormous, too. YOU MUST ORDER THIS DISH!!

For dinner we ordered:

Neo Shoyu Ramen - this was on their special menu of the day. OMG one of the best ramens I've ever had. The pork, noodles, bamboo shoots, broth, and seaweed were all perfectly seasoned and worked harmoniously together. The pork was meaty with a tiny strip of fat, but slightly chewy. Broth was out of this world delicious. Nice portion for a $10 bowl. SO HAPPY! 

Unagi Bibimbap - this dish was delicious. The stone pot was so hot that it kind of burnt the rice a tad. The unagi was silky and delightful. A little under seasoned, but paired perfectly with the rapini stir fry dish (nano Hana). 

Nano Hana - stir fried rapini w 3 types of mushrooms in a soy and garlic sauce. This is not the rapini I am used to aka broccoli rabe. It's actually pea vines that were used which is fine bc this dish was THE BOMB DOT COM. Yep I said it. So good! The flavors were amazingly well balanced and the mushrooms and greens were cooked just right. A plate of umami greatness if you ask me.

Overall, this restaurant impressed us and it's definitely not your typical Japanese sushi restaurant (not the ones we're used to). Tons of cool and unique dishes to choose from and loads of flavor bombs. The one thing that sucked was our server. He took our drink order and the octopus apps then disappeared for the rest of the night. Luckily all of the servers work together and run all of the food out to all the tables and take orders from other tables. The rest of the crew took good care of us and placed the rest of our dinner orders. Very friendly and smiley. We will definitely come back!

TIP: make a reservation ahead of time or call the restaurant before you arrive to be placed on their waiting list."}
{"text":"Its better to go at night with a group of friend to enjoy an awesome japanese pub. The food is good, the music is good, their drinks are nice, the staff is really entertaining (at night, they're really loud if its something that could be a bad aspect for some people)... Love the experience and is one of my go-to asian restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend around 1pm, and the place was pretty packed. We were seated quickly, but took a little bit of time to get our orders taken, and another 35 mins to get our food and water, making it a 45 mins wait till we got to eat.

Despite the wait, the food was pretty good. We ordered the spicy miso ramen, takoyaki and the mabo men set with rice and soup. The ramen wasn't actually spicy but was still quite flavourful, although I wish the boiled egg that came with it was a little more runny and not fully cooked. The mabo men was delicious as well, not being too spicy and perfect for those who want noodles without having soup.

Altogether, the food was good and the prices are fair especially for their lunch sets. The only cons would be the wait time to order and get our food. Would recommend, and suggest to reserve if you're going for supper!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Been here so many times and the chefs/owners are actually japanese. They helped me plan special menus for when I planned a Christmas party for my coworkers and even made some off menu items for certain people because of allergies or diets. I recommend just going there with some friends and trying the tasting menu. Trust me it's really filling."}
{"text":"They used to have a spicy garlic ramen for lunch but not anymore so was quite disappointed!

Took the ramen lunch set and was still pretty good.  The broth was light but flavorful. It also came with a little rice bowl topped with beef and onion. I would say this is very good for $13 lunch menu."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I had made reservations through the Yelp app. When I got there with my daughter the 2 waitress stop us at the door and ask my daughter for her ID ?  I have never been stop at the door of a restaurant to be ID!  NO minor allow in this restaurant!  I never heard anything like this before it's not like a strip joint! So are you telling me that All restaurant with a liquor license is not allowed to have any minors in the restaurant?  What kind of BS is that???  Yelp where is your thumbs down rating?"}
{"text":"Came here on a late Saturday night and it wasn't too busy. We ordered a few dishes - edamame, beef carpaccio, takoyaki, fried chicken. I thought everything was mediocre. No unique flavors or spices stood out and although everything was fresh and hot, I felt as though everything could be found in the freezer section of the grocery store. The decor is nice though."}
{"text":"Pretty good.
I just don't recommend the okonomiyaki. Its deep fried and not hot plate cooked like traditionally. Same with the takoyaki. Gindara is tasty though..lots of stuff here is premade and expensive. Very loud environment."}
{"text":"As most people have already said, it's a fun place. Cool and (overly?) cheery ambiance, alright cocktails (not boozy enough), but the food is just very average. It's tasty sure, but I expected more. 

The albacore tuna tataki was the best item we tried, I would have taken a second portion. I would say skip the karaage here, it's super bland and the garlic mayo taste will linger in your mouth for like a month and a half. I must say though that service was very speedy and the food was piping hot."}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere at Kinka Izakaya. All the waiters and cooks were so friendly, and they would greet everyone that came in and out of the restaurant. The ambiance may be a little loud for some people, but it's a perfect place to grab a few drinks and just hangout! We made reservations ahead of time on a Friday night for 10:00 PM, but unfortunately, we didn't get seated until ~25 mins later. This was probably because it was still very packed throughout the evening.   

Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, but if you're going there for dinner, it's so easy for your tab to rack up because you won't get full from just ordering a couple of dishes. I would recommend this place only if you're going for a small dinner/snack or drinks.  

Food we ordered:
- Lobster Sashimi ~ $16 (very delicious but portion was smaller than what I anticipated)
- Seared Albacore Tuna Sashimi ~$8.80 (delicious)
- Grilled Oysters ~$8.80 (the oysters were really large!)
- Takoyaki ~ $5.80 (delicious) 
- Stingray Fin ~ $4.80 (portion was smaller than what I anticipated)
- Matcha Cheesecake ~$6.30 (I would definitely recommend this cheesecake!)
- Sakura Drink ~$7.50 (a nice peachy drink) 

Overall: This is a great place for drinks if you don't mind the loud but friendly and fun ambiance. Food was delicious, and all the staff were so friendly. I'd also recommend the matcha cheesecake - not too sweet or heavy."}
{"text":"Food is creative, authentic, comforting and delicious!!!! Staff are the best...friendly and energetic! Orders and greetings are yelled in Japanese from the staff which creates this buzzing energy here. Great decor. Highly recommend the tasting menu. The karaage is the best in the city, super moist and tasty! 
My favourite place to drop in and have some Japanese tapas with a huge mug of Sapporo! Oiishi!!!"}
{"text":"I was with 3 people last friday the're was only 10 min wait. Food was good ,the tall draft beer were huge and what a heavy mug? Service was very good and what an ambiance. Will defenitely go back for a party"}
{"text":"Came here around 6 with a friend and was immediately seated since it was still pretty empty. I did notice that a lot of tables had reserved signs on them, and this place got PACKED by the time it was 7. We ordered the apple mojito, salmon tataki, agedashu tofu, ebimayo, kimchi nabe, and kakimayo (baked oysters the size of my hand). Everything was delicious and portions were larger than what I expected for an izakaya place. Loved the atmosphere of this place!"}
{"text":"Even though it's a bit pricey and the portions are a bit small, the food is really tasty. The people who work there are very welcoming, every time customers come in and out they scream and thank us for coming. The atmosphere is really nice and has a young mood, a bit noisy but still you get used to it. I would go back but not on a regular basis due to the price."}
{"text":"The super dynamic staff always makes this place so full of life! I reserved only 30 min ahead of time on a Friday evening after calling bar ganadara and leaning they were full for the night. 

The service was great and super quick! The dishes are mostly tapas with a variety of Japanese and Korean cuisines, both in hot (ramen, bibimbap, -don and fried foods) and cold (sashimi, sushi). They have a nice seasonal menu as well. 

My favourite were the scallop and salmon sashimi (seasonal) and the saba and salmon oshizushi. 

Their drinks menu is also varied and interesting, with mostly Japanese oriented flavours; matcha, Yuzu, litchi, sake, etc. Not very strong but pretty tasty. 

I highly recommend this place for a pre-night out with friends!"}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant in Montreal!! Everything was so great, and it was such a happy environment. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I love this place. Even the tasting menu is incredible. It's not even that expensive! 

I super super recommend the bibimbap and the hojicha crème brûlée. DAMN. 

The only negative is the constant SAKE BOOOOMB performances, but whatever, it's fun :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fun spot to go out with a group of loud mates. This is the place. Ramen is not the best but I can assure you that everything else on the menu is worth trying. And the best part of it all, the service is shockingly fast. I have been going to this place for the last 5 years and I'm never bored of it."}
{"text":"Mon aventure culinaire fût mitigé.

L'accueil est folklorique. Les employés saluent les clients en japonais. Au départ, on se sent surpris et on s'y prend au jeux.

Conseil : le restaurant a un vestiaire à l'entrée pour déposer les mentaux, car il y a exclusivement des cubes de bois pour s'asseoir (pas pratique)

Le décor est beau mais sans plus.

Le menu est plus ou moins traduit en français et pour ajouter un peu de piment, le personnel ne parle pas français.

Les plats servis lors de notre soirée, ont tous été très salés et au final l'addition aussi ... Environs 100$ à 3 et le restaurant ne propose pas séparer les additions car ils considèrent que ce sont des tapas qui se partagent entre invités.

Cérémonial inverse au départ avec les salutations du personnels en japonais.
Cela fait très attrape touriste ... .

Du potentiels mais c'est finalement une déception."}
{"text":"My 3 stars is really meant to be 3 1/2.
I have been here many times for lunch. It's one of those places where you know exactly how the food is going to be like, and it's just convenient and easy. 
The staff is always nice, friendly and helpful. The terrace is definitely a bonus during lunch time. 
The food, like I mentioned, is fine. Nothing extravagant but definitely not bad either. (i isually take something light, like a sashimi salad, so it's hard to screw up as there is no cooking involved...)
I would keep coming back here for lunch as they have an easy lunch menu, perfect for groups."}
{"text":"Kinka Izakaya was the most fun Japanese tapas bar I've been to. They had \"sake bomb\" chant-like things that they yelled with the customers who wanted to try and gulp it down. The overall atmosphere was so upbeat and alive. 

The food was also all so good, so good that I didn't realize how much we had until the bill came out (hence the 4 star). It was pricier than I expected and had eaten (small portions for its price). Regardless, you HAVE to try the baked oysters and the cheesecake. The matcha cheesecake is All. That. -SO good. SO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"What a fun place! We tried the tasting menu and a couple specials. Everything from sushi balls to bimbimbap. I had an amazing yuzu and 7-up cocktail with fresh thyme. Sounds weird but it was so smooth. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Very nice ramen and excellent tapas. Would recommend it as an fine example of traditional cuisine modified for a North American palate."}
{"text":"Montréal voit une recrudescence des Izakaya (Pub Japonais). Presque tous situé dans le deuxième quartier chinois de Montréal (Ste-Cath Ouest près de Guy) j'ai eu la chance d'essayé à de nombreuses reprises plusieurs endroits. Kinka est relativement nouveau et en toute honnêteté, si le Kazu n'avait pas été fermé pour raison de congé de la semaine de relâche je n'y serais pas allé. Néanmoins arrivé à l'ouverture l'endroit était calme et plutôt grand. Le service nous a tout de suite proposé un endroit avec l'explication que notre table était réservée 2h plus tard et il fallait avoir terminé. C'est un repas qui ne me prendra pas plus de 60-90 minutes. J'y suis allé avec un ami qui a un très bon appétit ce qui a fait que nous avons partagé près d'une dizaine d'entrée. 

Tapas est un bon terme pour se retrouvé car c'est clairement un endroit excellent ou on peut partagé presqu'entièrement notre repas.
Les Ramen un peu off: l'oeuf était complètement trop cuit et sec. Le bouillon bien mais un peu trop bouillant à mon goût. J'avais un sentiment de manger une soupe avec un bouillons réchauffé. 
L'Okonomiyaki est bon mais on dirait qu'il est cuit dans un moule lui donnant une forme un peu trop parfait. Néanmoins très bien! Nous avons aussi manger le maquereau sur grill et je dois admettre que c'était délicieux mais la façon dont il était servit rendait très difficile et très \"messy\" le partage de cette assiette. Le saumon en tataki au début du repas avait vraiment donnée une excellente impression et l'absence d'ordre combiné au manque de consistance dans la qualité des plats ont fait que j'ai aimé mon repas en soi. J'ai aimé le service efficace mais après Kazu ou Imadake ou même Yokato Yokabai et je pourrais continuer mon \"name dropping\" avec ceux que j'ai mangé à Toronto et tout mais en gros, Kinka Izakaya c'est le bas de la liste pour moi et je n'y retournerai pas. 

Je recommande si vous avec une quête de compléter un Top 4 des meilleurs Izakaya, mais sans ça, continuer votre chemin sur Ste-Catherine O et vous trouverez meilleur."}
{"text":"To me, this bar is so-so for a few reasons. I like the concept but I feel that management didn't execute the idea properly. Like the bar has the look and all but when I go inside the place, they got really loud modern music and I'm thinking to myself, should'nt there be more traditional Japanese music inside a place like this to add to the theme.

I also wish there was more Japanese beer selections, they only got 3 kinds of Japanese beers and I was hoping for more. I like the idea of these kinds of bars but I also want to feel relaxed in them which I can't.

Anyways, I probably won't go here again unless forced to by friends and they're paying."}
{"text":"It may say Kinka on the door, but this is as Guu as it gets.

I could talk about the experience for pages, but let's be honest... you want to hear about the food. The menu is the same as its Vancouver and Toronto counterparts, and is equally delicious. Highlights for me were the  baked oysters, seafood udon, spicy calamari, octopus balls, cod, the bibimbap, the fried chicken... you see where I'm going with this, right? Order basically anything off the menu, and you'll leave satisfied. 

Oh, and don't forget to wash it down with a plum wine mojito! 

Final note: if you're with a party of four or more, expect to wait. We were in on a Tuesday and waited for a table for over an hour. Not sure if they take reservations, but definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was decent. However the music was really loud and gave me a headache, which went away after I had their delicious sake/lime/mint/calpico cocktail thingy. Honestly a high-end feeling restaurant in regards to food, service, and bathroom quality (yeah they have a really nice bathroom check it out). 

The price is very reasonable as well, honestly a steal considering the quality of the food I had, but I can't say that for other food items. There are just a lot overpriced places with mediocre food in Montreal, but I finally got lucky with this one.  

I had the torched salmon pressed sushi which just melt in my mouth as well as the wagyu beef sushi which was really good as well. Would highly recommend those two. 

I just really wish the music would be some relaxing music instead of hardcore pop and rap; really ruins the relaxing and comforting ambiance Japanese restaurants usually carry, which reflects the tone of their cuisine. There was this unpleasant chlorine smell too, but that might have just been me. 

That being said, I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"really enjoyed the food at this restaurant , nice decor and lively ambience. Friendly and knowledgable staff. We waited a long time for our food though because they forgot our order BUT the manager did make that up to us and when we did get our food it was worth the wait !"}
{"text":"The Crispy Ramen Salad was  Whatever house sauce they make for it, I wanted to marry it. I also loved the Cheese Tofu appetizer and lemon cocktail !"}
{"text":"Really awesome place! This is part of the franchise they have in Toronto. 

Visited on a Sunday evening and was seated right away. You are greeted immediately upon entering in Japanese by all staff members. They shout to get each other's attention so be prepared for that (it caught me off guard the first time). 

The staff are super friendly and will answer any questions you may have. I decided on the torched ozisushi and kinoko bibimbap (basically my staple items here at Kinka). 

The dishes were served promptly and piping hot. He served asked if I wanted my rice mixed for me but I declined as I wanted to do it myself. I also asked for spicy sauce and without hesitation they brought it. 

The serving size of the salmon ozisushi (torched aburi sushi) was amazing. It incredible tasty, though they could've gone lighter on the mayo. The kinoko bibimbap in the stone bowl was extremely tasty too. Great balance of cheese, mushroom and rice. 

It is on the pricier side of things, but I would say it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, but the place is so noisy that I won't come for a second time unless they turn the music down."}
{"text":"We were given a brightly lit spot after I requested for it. The atmosphere was very welcoming and vivacious, so much that I was worried that my dinner date would be ruined. 

Was I wrong.

The server was extremely accommodating and really brought out the fun in the dining experience. He showed us the Sake Bomb special they were having and explained that the entire restaurant joins in the fun. We all yelled Sake Bomb and it was a great experience.

The food was phenomenal. I loved the ramen broth. The broth was clean and savoury. I absolutely enjoyed the aburi sushi and karaage chicken. Furthermore, the takoyaki and okonomiyaki combo really brought the flavour level to new heights. It was just so savoury and delicious. Overall, we had a memorable time here."}
{"text":"Je suis venue prendre un verre ce soir avec quelques amies. Nous avons commandé quelques plats à partager dont: des dumplings aux légumes qui n'avaient malheureusement pas trop de goût, des shorts ribs au boeuf que nous avons trouvé très bons et un plat de sashimis qui était également assez bien préparé. Côté ambiance, la musique était bien trop forte en plus de tout le bruit qu'il y avait dans la salle. On avait du mal à s'entendre parler à mesure que l'heure avançait vu que la salle se remplissait. Le service était bien en général."}
{"text":"Reserved online for their Kinka à table 2017 menu.
The menu is a 7 course meal includes some sashimi (lobster, salmon & tuna), fried chicken, bbq beef rib, salad, big oyster, hot rock fried rice & green tea ice cream.

Everything was very tasty except the BBQ beef rib which is a bit too salty for my taste. 

Overall the price was a great value, $29 per person for minimum 2 persons.

Please be sure to try it out as this menu ends on March 18.

Great services and great ambiance!"}
{"text":"I stood in line for an hour at Kazu and didn't get seated, so I decided to come here instead. The restaurant is pretty large and has a lot of seating. I sat at the bar. I think I would like to try this place again in the middle of the week or for lunch. The place was extremely loud, because several large groups of people were taking sakebombs every few minutes. I think the staff yells something and then the patrons yell something back whenever they get shots. I ordered the wasabi octopus, a sashimi salad, and the blackened miso cod. The octopus had waaaay too much wasabi on it. You know that moment of panic when you eat too much wasabi and you think you might die? That happened with every bite. It was also really small. Just, not worth it in my opinion. The sashimi salad was awesome though. It was bigger than I thought it would be (enough for a light meal) and was really delicious. The blackened cod is the star of the show though. It was buttery and had rich flavors. I'd go back just for this. Honestly, I'd probably give this place a 3.5, but I'm rounding up because of the cod."}
{"text":"SAKE BOMB! 

My friends and I had a really great meal last night. The place was packed and reservations are obviously mandatory to get a table.

Having never been to an Izakaya before, I was a bit overwhelmed by the atmosphere and the constant screaming at first, but you get into it and next thing you know you're screaming SAKE BOMB! with everyone in the place.

The food was very tasty and felt like authentic Japanese. The black cod is superbe, the ramen broth spectacular, the beef carpaccio is really good, but really it's the fried chicken that I fell in love with.

It was so good that we stole the order intended for the next table. I'm not even sorry.

I also want to mention the service. The staff was patient, friendly, and made delicious recommendations. The place was packed and they took the time to answer our many questions and never made us feel rushed.

SAKE BOMB!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go, when uninspired for lunch or dinner. My favourite dish here is the salmon sushi, it just melts in your mouth with this charred taste that's so satisfying. The price is decent and the portions are reasonable."}
{"text":"Normally we are very happy with the food and the service here. This time was quite different. Saturday night the restaurant was full, we are a table of two weeks ordered 4 or 5 plates to share. 

The service was incredibly long, my thoughts was the kitchen was lagging. Grouping up tables to send food out, but not paying attention to tables waiting for a while. All in all we spent around 2 hrs waiting for our total of 5 plates with some long waits in between. 1 plate followed by a 30min wait then another, and another. 

Maybe was just an off night for them. For now we will only be coming back during the weekdays to relive our previous experiences."}
{"text":"I went to Kinda Izakaya with 12 of my friends. We had impeccable service - the plates were well timed, the food was good and the prices were reasonable. It worked out to roughly $50 per person including tip and taxes - we all had cocktails / beer and plenty of food. Very satisfying! I highly recommend for big groups! If you go with a group of people, take note that they do not split the bill by individual. They can split it all equally so that everyone gets a bill, but they won't keep track of who ordered what. This wasn't a  problem for my group, we shared everything and just split everything evenly. We had too many dishes to list here (I think we tried everything) but some of my faves were the tempura veggies with matcha salt, fried chicken, pork belly, Japanese style chicken wings and I loved the sake mojito!"}
{"text":"It's a good restaurant with decent food but I wouldn't recommend coming here if you want to catch up with your friends. It can get pretty noisy but the atmosphere is nice. I recommend the udon and the specialty drinks. :)"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try out this new gem. The place has a great embiance, nice place to chill, drink and share food with friends. 

My friends and I tried: the BBQ eel with rice, fresh raw egg and burdock on a hot stone bowl - super delicious 4/5

Ramen noodles in a chicken and roasted pork broth. Asian soul food 4/5

Tuna tatare, Tuna tataki and Ebimayo were amazingly fresh 4/5

Baked oysters - I was excited about this one, but it fell short for me. It was OK - it tasted overly salty with the mayo and cheese. I felt like it over powered the oysters. 2/5

I definitely can't wait to go back and try the rest!! Great new place"}
{"text":"???????? ! Izakaya japonaise sympa & moderne située sur la rue Sainte-Catherine entre Guy & St-Mathieu dans le Faubourg Ste-Catherine.

{"text":"Original dishes but small portions, not so amazed by their food but it was a good supper. They have a nice terrace so it's quite nice for summer. Overpriced according to me, but it was worth trying overall."}
{"text":"This is a very vital Japanese restaurant & bar. I went there today with my friends and we ordered two Sake Bomb. Before drink it, the server lead us to play \"I say Sake, you say Bomb\" game. That was really fan haha! It may be quite noisy inside but I like the ambiance there! 
For food, we order a tofu salad, fried chicken wings, sashimi and ramen. The taste was good."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place that could hold a reservation for a group of 10 and this place was an excellent choice. For the first time, I have used yelp reservation online, it was quick, easy and super cool - few clicks and the place was reserved! The atmosphere inside is fun and friendly, it is a bit more noisy than your average restaurant/bar, you hear sake bomb shout outs quite often. The tasting menu is great, you get to try different dishes which include meat, fish and greens too. If you add a big 1 liter mug of Sapporo beer to that meal and you're all set for a perfect evening with friends or colleagues."}
{"text":"Very nice!! Went there for lunch. We were greeted by a nice \"welcome\" in Japanese (don't ask me to repeat it...). The decor is very nice. Service is friendly and very good. The food was served fast (important for lunch time since we were on a schedule...) and it was delicious. Unfortunately, since I was working, I couldn't have a drink!!! I think it's a great excuse for me to go back and have sake bombs... and sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Finally a really fabulous eatery in Shaughnessy Village/Concordia Ghetto area!

I came here yesterday shortly after they opened, so there was no line-up or anything of the sort and was promptly seated at the bar, which was great because I could watch them preparing dishes and watch the dishes I didn't order fly by so I have a better idea for next time.  And there definitely will be a next time.

First off, the decor is simple, spartan but very elegant. Tables are pine wood and the walls look like they've been woven.  The servers I had were super friendly and it was fun watching then yell out the orders in Japanese.
They serve cocktails here which I did not try but instead went straight for the plum wine. I usually try out old stand-bys first and  see how good they are before I try out more unique and original dishes. And I must say, the food here was stellar. 

I had the Nanohana, garlic stir-fried rapini with enoki and shiitake mushrooms,  along with the Karaage, soy sauce marinated fried chicken and Takoyaki, the octopus dumplings. If greens were this tasty everywhere all the time, trust me, moms everywhere would never have anything to ever worry about again. As for the fried chicken, I think at some point there will need to be a \"Best Fried Chicken in Montreal\" list because this could be a contender.  The Takoyaki were also perfect. Firm on the outside, soft on the inside and the octopus was not overcooked at all.

Also, I have to say the bathrooms here are very, very clean and probably has one of the coolest tap and sinks I've seen in a while, more reminiscent of a country pump and wooden tub. I have never before seen bathrooms that also carry and offer free feminine hygiene products. Very thoughtful and forward thinking."}
{"text":"We sat on the terrasse because the music inside was blasting and I already had a headache. Too bad because its very pretty inside. We ordered 5 appetizers. And two drinks. My tokyo drink was awsome. The appetizers however were lacking.  Only 1 out 5 was amazing which was the salmon sashimi,  specialty of the day. The chicken wings were nice and crispy. But thats pretty much it. Overall too pricey for what you get. Spent $70 for 5 tiny tapas and two drinks. And we were still hungry unfortunately. But I have to mention the service was outstanding. All the waiters were extremely nice and attentive. Well done on service!"}
{"text":"Pros
- The food was delicious
- The warm welcome from the staff upon entry is a very nice touch
- Great decor

Cons
- Our party of 16 was assigned a table that seated no more than 12. I had to sit sideways on the bench to accommodate everyone
- Portions per dish are very small. Though I appreciate gourmet tapas, $10 for a fistful of spinach with a couple of mushrooms is a stretch
- Our bill wasn't split, forcing us to divvy a $670 bill ourselves
- One member of our party wasn't served at all after 2 hours of waiting
- Ordering the grapefruit cocktail gets you a vodka/soda, grapefruit half and citrus juicer. Very original, but insufficient juice and less labor leaves you wondering why you paid the mark up.

Overall
Maybe the moral of our story is to avoid going in a large group. Cramped seating, divvied portions and a single bill all point towards the restaurant's inexperience in dealing with parties larger than 5. Though I loved the food, the value and the service will prevent me from re-visiting."}
{"text":"Much hyped restaurant opening in Montreal: just like Vancouver and Toronto, Montreal was going to have its own isakaya (Japanese pub) belonging to the Guu franchise! Although I really appreciated the other Guu locations, Kinka didn't resonate as well with me. For starters, the drink selection is more limited, and it doesn't even serve Asahi Black. The fact that only the Sapporo can be ordered as a pitcher makes me question the credibility of this place as a bar/pub--the sake and cocktail selection is plentiful, but beer is definitely the staple of any bar in my opinion.

As expected, the menu is filled with tasty Japanese tapas, ranging from fried foods to fresh sashimi. I always have the same order whenever I go to a Guu location: karaage (fried chicken), takoyaki (fried octopus balls), okonomiyaki (panfried seafood pancake) and chirashi bowl/plate (sashimi over greens or rice). All ordered items were cooked true to fashion, except that the okonomiyaki was disappointing (overcooked on the outside, but soggy on the inside), just like the sashimi salad--some of the fish tasted like it was defrozen. However, prices are cheap (around $7 a plate, and you can be full on two small plates), and there are combos (ramen+tapas+drink) that allow you to have a good meal without breaking the bank.

The atmosphere is typical of any Guu location: noisy, rowdy but welcoming, since the staff greets (or yells greetings) every time a new guest walks into the restaurant. The decor is dark but sophisticated, very reminiscent of industrial design because of the use of metallic colors for the ceiling and the walls. Perfect for groups and casual hangouts."}
{"text":"The food is incredibly good. I was over the moon with the ramen noodle soup, the jellyfish and the \"Hotate\" cold appetizer. Being able to discover new sakes each time is really appreciated. The selection is long enough. 

The staff is attentive and the manager is incredibly good to solve any problem in a very fine way ; ). The volume of the music is good but could be just a little bit lower to be able to enjoy more conversations with tiny female voices 0: ).

WARNING ! Otherwise, the place can be really too loudly especially during Fridays evening when the restaurant is full. I really recommend to anyone with sensible ears like me to avoid Fridays evening. And when it is full of people, you can expect the service will be waay slower ! 

Doing a reservation is strongly recommended if you want to have a good place. The place has a terrasse on Ste Cath street and if you want a chance to eat there, you have to call them."}
{"text":"Superb! The service is great, and the food is quite delicious, however, a few items didn't have great presentation. The place is also quite loud, with the staff randomly cheering throughout the service. It adds to a very 'hip' urban ambiance, with seemingly 'traditional' menu items. They have a decent sake selection. I'd recommend anyone to check this place out!"}
{"text":"This was a fun and exceptionally delicious dinner with my cousin. We sat at the bar and ordered a bottle of warm sake, my first time. Seeing as it was on special Monday, it was $23 instead of $28. To share, we ordered the baked oysters, yaki udon, Nanohana, salmon tartare and one other dish from the daily special I forgot the name. Basically the food was magical! It did things to my taste buds I probably should not repeat on a public review. The service was great as well. I'd probably say my ultimate favourite, though very difficult to pick one, were the baked oysters. But everything was delicious! I thought it was decently priced. And I definitely recommend sharing. To top it off, my cousin and I had sake bombs and that was such a fun, loud experience. Try it out! Next trip to Montréal I will be returning."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since its opening and it seems like the food quality varied between the two visits. I've been to several Guu restaurants in Vancouver and Toronto and even though the menu is more or less the same, it all depends on who is cooking the dish (sometimes it's greasier/saltier/soggier and sometimes it is just perfect). Regardless, it's usually a fun place to have a birthday party for larger groups.

The dish I can never go without is the kabocha korokke. When done properly, it's crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside with a tiny quail egg hidden in the center and dipped in a flavourful mayo sauce. The Kakimayo is also a favorite of mine in the winter. It is very much like a rockefeller oyster. It comes out piping hot, so don't burn yourself. It is a very filling portion. The karaage (crispy chicken) is nothing special, it's just fried chicken.  The kabocha zenzai dessert is a bowl  of  soft/mushy textured Asian desserts overlying pureed kabocha that will not suit everyone's taste. The best option is to pick items off the day's special. I always choose 2-3 items from the list and have never regretted it. 

The reason I didn't rate this place higher was because I once arrived one person short in my dinner party and the waiter literally gave her spot away after 20 minutes (even though we had started ordering) and we had to argue to get the seat back. It made for a very stressful eating experience. 

If I have the choice (ie small party of less than 3-4 people) and the patience  to wait more than 30 minutes for supper, I would always choose to go to Kazu down the block, but Kinka is a very decent alternative for larger groups and impatient people."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Very nice spot. The restaurant is quite clean and the atmosphere is very lively!

FOOD: Quality was very good. The plates are more on the fancier side and are nicely presented, although the portions are small (but what do you expect from a tapas bar). I wasn't the BIGGEST fan of their udon, I found it too soft and like it had been sitting in water for too long. But their karaage, takoyaki and sashimi were delicious. I also liked their unagi bibimbap. 

PRICE: Price is a little more on the expensive side since tapas dishes are smaller. For example, I paid 9$ for a dish of sashimi (about 5 pieces). Taste and quality were good but portions are small.

SERVICE: Super friendly. The staff welcome you very warmly as soon as you walk into the restaurant and make sure that you are comfortable and are happy with your meals."}
{"text":"Most fun place to eat before going out! The food is exceptional and delicious! The staff is energetic and helpful! I would also suggest to use this Yelp page to figure out what to eat!"}
{"text":"Love the food here, last time we went for date night, we took the set menu. SO GOOD - but come hungry!! The black cod is to die for, make sure you try octopus balls and their short ribs."}
{"text":"Everyone yells, claps, and cheers when you walk in. Loved that. The food is amazing. I was beyond impressed. Living in NYC I had high expectations, and kinka did not disappoint. Service was fantastic too"}
{"text":"This is the less-noisy version of Imadake. Great food, though, very different menu from Imadake. I adore the vintage  artworks everywhere"}
{"text":"Looking for a fun atmosphere? This is the place to be at. Chants of Sake bombs ring out all night. Fast service, not to mention the delicious distinctive dishes. Fresh sashimi."}
{"text":"If you want decent pub food - Asian or not - with super fast service and well-priced beer to substitute any mediocre pubs in the neighbourhood, you will understand why an Izakaya-snob like me would actually give it a 4 star! I just love coming here before catching a concert / hockey game at Bell centre because how predictable this place is.
Sashimi portion is tiny and the tasting menu is more expensive than ordering items separately. After you get over this pricing issue, this place is actually quite cheap: try bibimbap, seafood salad, gyoza, wings...pretty much anything comforting OR Korean-sounding are good: now,  hold your tasty beef short rib in one hand and your cold beer in the other- and imagine how amazing this is compared to that Mc~~ pub that one friend of yours wanted to go instead :p"}
{"text":"Kinka izakaya was a delight! Friendly staff, quickly seated outdoors, the cocktails were good and every single tapas was delicious! 2-3 tapas per person for 5$-12$ each. Very affordable. Would come back again and again to try everything. 200% recommended."}
{"text":"J'ai trouvé tres bon , belle presentation des assiettes, bon service , je suis satisfaite surtout que c'etait en semaine et tranquile ( les weekends il parait que ca crie fort ! )"}
{"text":"Awesome and lively Japanese restaurant. Make sure to reserve beforehand! We got the Sake Bombs, which comes with an experience -- should definitely get! Then the Salmon Sashimi was great high quality salmon. The Udon though, I thought was underwhelming and could improve in taste/flavor. Portion was really small as well. The Salmon  Oshizushi is another good choice if you're craving sushi but it came out extremely late...when we finished our extrees. Ending with the desserts was great, would definitely recommend the cheesecake and ice cream! Should come for the fun dining experience!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, great food, great vibe, great experience. The toro caru, kara age, the short ribs and the black cod 5*"}
{"text":"I tried their Toronto location about a year ago, and their Montreal location is just as good.

The place is \"upbeat\" to say the least.  The servers and cooks are yelling and running around with high energy.  It is a lot of fun to watch but I imagine you have to be in the mood.

The food is just delicious and served tapas style. I had the following:
Eel Bowl - piping hot rice and eel in a sweet sauce and sitting in a very hot clay pot.  The food continues to cook and carmelize as you eat it and it is just plain amazing

Seared Albacore - fresh with onion and masago. Amazing

Spicy fried chicken wings - a great portion of sweet breaded wings. 

Local salmon sashimi - fresh with a portion of the belly.

I am a HUGE fan of this place.  The waiters and waitresses are super cool, the food is delicious and the vibe is great.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"The whole restaurant yells a greeting when you walk through the front door!
They are not so great at refilling the water. But are so polite that if you ask they will. 
It's a tapas place so a good idea to order many plates for the table. 
Children under 18 are not allowed because it has a bar. 
The tuna sashimi, tuna carpaccio \"toro carru\", seaweed salad, short ribs, vegetarian gyoza (fried) are some of the best. 
Check the menu that has specials of the day. 
For dessert, the green tea cheese cake is the best. And green tea ice cream is good too. 
You can order grape fruit vodka and it comes with a fresh grape fruit for you to squeeze. 
The service is extremely friendly and very fast. 
They made a big chaotic show out of my brother's birthday with all the staff. With noise, a sign and a personalized photo! Amazing customer service. 
They split the bill for large groups which is very nice. 
We ate as much as we wanted and the bill only came to about $35 per person. 
You get frozen grapes with your bill."}
{"text":"Totally not living up to my expectations! We arrived ten minutes after opening and they are already out of rice? The waiter asked us to change our orders several times. They are out of fired vegetables so they offered salad instead(which is just a few vegetables leaves with soy sauce), or fries. And then they say they are out of fries! So they offered rice and fried vegetables instead??? What do the restaurants take us for? Idiots?? This is without a doubt the worst Japanese restaurant I have ever been to!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent food although the the noise level is also pretty high... Service staff greets everyone upon entrance and exit. Really makes you feel appreciated!
Portions are pretty small but that's normal since it is tapas style."}
{"text":"I come here for birthday celebrations with my friends. I enjoy the vibe here for that kind of event, but context matters when dining here.

Food: great. I like almost everything here, but don't expect a lot of nigiri/sashimi/maki like a more traditional Japanese restaurant. Most fish is featured as part of a dish. The gindara is fantastic in my opinion.

Service: fairly timely and sometimes fast. The staff is kind and courteous. They are accommodating and encouraging for activities ranging from birthday celebration to sake bomb chants with your table.

Price: fair for what it is. Not much else to say here. Make sure to take advantage of their daily deals for drinks.

Atmosphere: this place is super loud, both the people and the music. Make sure to come only if you're looking for a lively vibe like you might find at a bar."}
