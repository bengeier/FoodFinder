{"text":"Went to the Orchid Room for lunch today for the first time, It's kind of an up-scale licensed Vietnamese restaurant in Bankers Hall.  Shared the Skewer Sampler and ordered the Special Vermicelli Bowl with their rose green tea. WOW... LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. Although on the pricy side, this was one of the best/unusual Vietnamese dishes I've tasted.   It is what they say. \"Vietnamese, Thai and French flavors all in one\" I will go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in years, even though it's in the same building as where I work. Not because of the food (quite delicious in fact), but it's really expensive. A bowl of pho can run from $16-$20, which in my opinion may be due to location for the up charge. I've never spent more than $10 on a really good bowl of pho.  In any case, I've tried a lot of their other dishes here: pan seared spicy salmon (served on rice), chicken pad thai and my favourite which is the sesame beef (beef tenderloin stir fried in a teriyaki sauce with lemon grass and sesame seeds, fresh veggies on rice). They do have really good salad rolls, the mango and shrimp ones are served with a yummy coconut peanut sauce.  Presentation is definitely a priority, each dish is always garnished with an orchid, rice entrees have the rice wrapped in fresh banana leaves and all other dishes are put together with neat artistic charm.  So if you are in the mood to really treat yourself, then I'd recommend Orchid Room."}
{"text":"A wonderful Asian fusion restaurant on the second floor of Banker's Hall right across from Sunterra. It is almost always packed during lunch time and for good reason. In addition to wonderful service and a neat out-into-Bankers-Hall patio, the food is amazing.   A good primal/paleo option is the Spicy Coconut Soup with Chicken. The base is coconut milk with green curry. Mixed in with vegetables, it is addictive delicious. There are accents of lemon grass that really ties the soup all together. The bowl is huge taking me a good 45-60 mins (in between conversation) to finish.   It isn't cheap ($17.95) and it does comes out very hot, so I would recommend you wait at 5 -10 minutes for your first slurp unless you can tolerate scalding temperatures. That being said, I really love this place as a down-town lunch option.  It's fun and the food is great!   Open M-W 10-6, R-F 10 - 8 and Sa 10-5:30. Not open on Sundays."}
{"text":"A rather fancy Vietnamese. I tried the chicken red curry first. It tasted pretty sweet, not spicy at all, very boring and the chicken in it tasted fishy. So I asked for something different: beef sate pho. Again not spicy, the taste was okay.  The dishes start at $17, which is almost twice as much as you pay for pho at other places. If it would contain more ingredients or other things worth the money I would be okay with it, but that is not the case.  The waitress was really nice and the place/location is also good, that's why I give two stars... I usually prefer not to write a review after only one visit, but they won't see me again."}
{"text":"Great place!! Must try. My favourite are the curry dishes... YUM :)"}
{"text":"Great place!  Food was amazing.  They get pretty busy at lunch so I recommend making a reservation and they actually take pre-orders when time is tight.  Would recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"When you go to this small restaurant during lunch hours it is necessary to call for reservations.  The menu is made up of noodle bowls and other similar dishes. Although the lunch menu was small, everyone had a great meal. I had some special noodle bowl (sorry, cant remember the name) but it had shrimp wrapped in beef and cooked that way. Delicious. Definitely worth going back for another one.  There were a number of rolls, both deep fried and \"fresh\" on the appetizer menu. We all shared the lettuce wrap. It was fresh and tasty, but not tasty enough that I would order it again. It really tasted like lettuce, not shrimp. The peanut sauce that came with it was delicious. It really made the wrap.  All in all, the menu looked interesting enough to try some of the other dishes. It's a place I would certainly recommend."}
{"text":"I hosted our company Christmas party there. The food was excellent, the staff were very friendly and accommodating for our colleagues that were allergic to gluten. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Like any kind of Asian food? Then you'll like this place.  Asian fusion is just another way to say they offer a ton of different Asian food dishes. I have had the opportunity to eat here a couple of times and have tried the chicken curry and the chicken vermicelli. I am a huge fan of the curry that came with some delicious coconut rice. Unfortunately, I found the vermicelli was a little lacking in flavor so I wouldn't recommend that dish. The wait staff were friendly and polite.  You must try the jasmine tea here. I don't know where they get this tea from, but it is delicious and is definitely worth trying if you are a tea fan. Their coconut ice cream is also very good and worth it if you have any room left.  A great place to grab some lunch."}
{"text":"Reservation was easy, just called a day before; food tasted really good, we ordered different dishes, mine was Sesame Beef with Coconut rice; it was really good. Everybody enjoyed what they ordered. Service was good, it was a busier day, lunch hour, a little slower service but overall we did not wait long for the food. It's a bit on the higher side for the price, as portions are smaller than what you normally expect but again overall experience was good.  If you are in Bankers Hall and want to be seated in a better dining place than the food courts nearby, this is a good place to try."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch today. The restaurant was half full and we got in fine without reservations. The atmosphere and service is great as indicated by previous reviews. However, if you're looking for value ($ paid for amt and quality of food paid for), this place is NOT it. Even now I cringe over the fact that I paid $16 for an unspectacular bowl of pho ga (chicken), especially when I could have had a better bowl for half the price in Chinatown.   This place is grossly overpriced; although I guess with its typical clientele (suits rolling in oil and gas money), I guess it's really not that much of a surprise."}
{"text":"I usually book at Orchid Room when I want quick service and really, really great food.  Their Vietnamese/Thai fare is really good, though more higher-priced than say, Chinatown.  Their dishes come out of the kitchen and to your table with an ambiance and presence especially, with that definitive orchid on your plate as well as food cooked with tender loving care!    I usually get the Sampler's Plate as it's a nice portion for lunch - 2 spring rolls, 2 salad rolls and 2 satay skewers (1 beef and 1 chicken).  Comes with peanut sauce and sprinkled with tons of fried garlic slivers and crushed nuts.  Sometimes, I will feel like having their curry with rice - prawns and their curry is spot on!   Sometimes, I will feel like their Salmon on fresh greens - absolutely fresh and healthy!  I love the dressing.  There are 2 parts to the restaurant - the inside and their \"patio\" seating which is actually still inside the Bankers Hall.  I like their \"patio\" seating as I always find the inside part of the restaurant to be too loud for me and I cannot hear what people are saying at the table.  While on the outside, it's more open-air and you can also people-watch during the busy lunch hour.  The wait staff is very polite and acknowledges when I visit the restaurant and get quick service right away!  Love Orchid Room!  I bring lots of my friends to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Our 2nd visit to this place was an even better experience. Loved the food and service! One more star for them :-) The soups are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Yum what a fantastic Asian cushion restaurant. Came here for lunch with Steven M. And had a wonderful meal. There was a little but of a language barrier between the server and I but she seemed to really care a lot to get our order right, verifying it numerous times. A little pricy but man you are full when you waddle out of the restaurant. Enjoyed some great spring rolls, skewers and pad Thai! They were really great at getting us I and out within the hour which is perfect for working downtown. I love the decor, the tables were set so nicely and all of the little details were taken care of. I'd definitely recommend this place as a great lunch spot for a business meeting  or a date!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here several times over the years and found that service was quick in catering to the business crowd and the food is very good. As with any restaurant, some dishes are better than others. The soups are only OK but the skewers, spring rolls, coconut rice and noodle bowls are tasty. I've had the fish and that was good too but the fried squid was a bit oily.  Overall, I like the convenience of the location and the warm, inviting decor. It really adds an upscale flair to have fresh flowers on the table and it feels like a lunch getaway except for when you sit in the actual +15 area where they also have tables. The interior is tight and your neighbouring table will hear every word you're saying to your lunch companions. The prices may seem a bit high but are expected since you're in Bankers Hall."}
{"text":"Located on the 2nd floor of Bankers Hall, Great place for lunch during the week. Always busy so I recommend a reservation. Good food and not greasy, very fresh and lite. My personal Fav is the lemon grass chicken with salad rolls to start. Also a great place to people watch if you sit on the indoor patio. Make a reservation if you can or show up early."}
{"text":"Great pad Thai!! Probably one of the best I have had in calgary so far... I went there for lunch with a group of friends and everybody loved their main entree... I think this is a good place inside the bankers hall... I would go back to try other things as everything looks very good!! I had the cocktail of juice and it was delicious! The service was friendly and on time... As It gets busy for lunch I recommend make reservations..."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago and enjoyed the food so much I forgot to write a review!  We had the green curry and it was out of this world delicious. Very friendly staff and well worth the $$$. If you are looking for something a little different, try out this gem in Bankers Hall!"}
