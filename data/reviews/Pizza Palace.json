{"text":"absolutely the worst service ever... Waited for over an hour for a pickup, Service was horrible.. and when we asked for the manager was told he was unavailable.. and did not want to take our phone calls.."}
{"text":"Pizza is great BUT the wings are fabulous!!! Had the mild and the barbecue. This will be my definite wing place from now on. And a side note, the cheesecake is homemade and so good, I ordered a whole one. Very nice staff is also a plus."}
{"text":"Good pizza, at a good price. The wings are GREAT ! They only accept cash, so keep that in mind while ordering. It's a much better option than the chain places that usually deliver. The service is friendly and quick and I will defiantly be coming back for more pizza and wings :)"}
{"text":"Used to go often when Ceaser owned it - but since the change and a bad experience haven't been back in over a year.  Ordered some chicken wings with our pizza and the wings they served HAD to have been recycled from the lunch buffet 8 hours previously. Dry, hard, soaked in red hot sauce to try and \"cover up\". When I mentioned it to the owner - he simply took the wings back and then TRIED to charge me for them -until I refused to pay for them. Nothing else offered in compensation.  Mind you - they know me but they haven't seen me for a long long long time because of that lack of customer service.  Too many other pizza places and PALACES now in the area.  Oh well - maybe I\"ll get brave and try again....in a few years."}
{"text":"The dude on the phone was friendly. Ordered delivery. The food was good. Ordered canolis for desert. Literally 33% of the shell had nothing in it. Just the two ends were filled the middle of the thing was completely empty. Tasted good but I've never had a canoli that was filled like that before. Seems a little cheap."}
{"text":"Our take out pizza of choice, great \"up north\" wings too.  We also went to a wedding and Pizza Palace was the caterers... fantastic.... soooooo... I had them cater my wife's 60th birthday party at our house... 55 people.  It was perfect. Everyone loved it.  On time, hot, tasty... great price too. Thanks"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Waitresses were very nice. Pizza was delicious, nice crispy crust, flavorful, and the wings were great too. Not greasy or too breaded. I'll be coming here my next trip!!"}
{"text":"Went to order food tonight for take out ,and in today's world they did not accept debit or credit cards,Cash only ,so we left . Why would you jeopardize  your business like that. And on top of that their employees were smoking g out front . Love to smell your smoke will not be back."}
{"text":"Have always been my go to pizza place..went to the buffet today for lunch..a bit pricey $9 and I have to say I was disappointed. The pasta was bland(watery sauce) and the pizza was ok..the wings were great as usual. I'll stick to just ordering pizza but I don't think I'll come in for the buffet again."}
{"text":"Food is good but website/ menu are misleading in regards to hours and accepting of credit cards. Definitely call before planning on placing order to verify that they are open...  8/31/17 Tried to order for delivery at 7:50pm as they close at 10pm. Was told all that was left was wings and that the stoves were off and were not being turned back on for the night. Once again, great food, but apparently only at THEIR convenience...."}
{"text":"Best hot wings around! Great flavor and the owners and staff very friendly,"}
{"text":"Omg!! The worst pizza I have ever had. The dough was so soggy when I picked up a slice everything fell apart!! We ate it in pieces with a fork . ;(  the crust was hard, maybe cooked earlier and re heated?? It didn't taste well at all...... Well we tried. Sorry Pizza Palace !! First impression is a must!!!!! ;("}
{"text":"Terrible experience tonight. We ordered three pies at 5:10 at 6:55 they showed up. We called and asked about the delay we were told there had been an emergency in the parking lot. Believe me we understand emergency as well as anyone else. But to have to call and not have the common courtesy of calling us to inform us of the delay. And to top it off the pizza arrived almost 2 hours late not hot and she we were charged full price. Very sad cause we normally go to the place and will not return. On. Good not the delivery guy was courteous and polit"}
{"text":"I have to say that I am very impressed by the pizza. We have tried every pizza place in this area and have been disappointed. We hesitated to try this place based on the mixed reviews but we are very glad we did.  I love NY pizza and grew up in Jersey. There are not a lot of places to go around here if you are nostalgic for that familiar taste. I thought that their ingredients were fresh and of high quality.  The crust was crisp and chewy and very tasty. All 4 of us are more than we intended to eat. I was impressed that their meatballs are homemade. They even make homemade stuffed crust pizza.  What's not to love? This is my second time back in a week. I met the owner and he seems like a great guy and is a NY native. We are looking forward to our next visit already."}
{"text":"Staying in a local hotel, waited 2 hours for my pizza. it came, was cold, wasn't what I ordered. I also ordered a salad, it came, no dressing, no utencils. With tip was $30.00. I would pass....."}
{"text":"I am surprised at the negative reviews on this  restaurant.  My sister and I went here last Saturday, ( Nov. 25,2011) right before the Janet Jackson concert. I had had coupons for the buffet , but they were not being honored as it is Holidays.  So.. we saw a sign for Pizza Palace.  Me being one to NEVER turn down Pizza ( or lasagna for that matter). we were game.   Now, the only thing was, we were in a hurry to get to the concert on time. ( we should have stayed longer cos she didn't go on until 10PM).  We get in there and its got ambiance- good music (top 40s  from the 80s - super points)., dim lighting as well. The  oven in back was doing it's thing, because it smelled so good.  So, we order. Now, service was a  little slow, but our waitress was nice and  wasn't crowded either.  We got our menus and quickly ordered a whole pepperoni pizza and half of it had jalapenos ( for my sister *cough cough* not for me).. We had the special: a ten inch  pizza and  a pitcher of beer. ( I had a Sprite). The soft drink was tasty and refreshing. Our waitress was pleasant and answered our questions.       We waited for the pizza  hoping it'd be out fast. I was like\" this better be good\"   Low and behold, it was soooooooooooooo good. And not just because we were hungry.. I love  pizza with  a robust sauce.  Not only did it have full flavor that  I could savor, but it also had crispy pepperonis!!  POINTS !!!  It's like they had the magic oven. it was perfect. Not to greasy and the  dough was not too thick. OH MAN!  We each had 4 slices. We wanted more, but we were  needing to leave to get across the street to Ceaser's.     I  have to tell you: the place was clean. the food came hot, and  it was not a let down in the  least.  I also have to say, i have been dreaming about going back to this place since I left. I will be back and I am bringing friends!  Its a small place, but enough that you can definitely bring people and have a really nice time.     What did we pay you ask? I'll tell ya; for all that we got our bill was about  $22 :-) so worth it too!    I would suggest this to anyone that loves a good meal and has time to sit down and eat.  :)    P.S. The Janet Jackson concert was really good too :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved here from Matthews and have ordered pizza from every freakin place around here and been disappointed. We ordered from pizza palace a few weeks ago and a couple times after that and were very pleased. I am a New York native (unlike my husband who wouldn't know good pizza if it slapped him in the face) and this is definitely New York crust. Its perfectly thin and chewy. I just hope they work out the kinks with credit cards and hours."}
{"text":"I am the pizza monster!  I am always on the prowl for the best slice, and Pizza Palace was not bat at all.  Who says that Italians are the only people that can cook up a good pie.  Cesar and his son are some great fellas from the Middle East and they know the pizza craft.  The calzones here are bursting with mozzarella, tangy sauce, and crispy bread.  The first time I came here, it was for their Sunday buffet.  All the treats are fresh and hot!  Skip Pizza Hut and all of those other chains, the palace will make you reconsider your favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"Waited 50 minutes for lukewarm, mediocre pasta.  Won't be doing that again."}
{"text":"Oh, no    Oh, no no no no no.    You know those rare occurences when you go to a restaurant, sit down, peruse the menu and settle for something, even though it wasn't what you really wanted?  You know those odd times when you get the food put in front of you and from the first bite you know immediately something is tasting wrong, doesn't taste very good at all actually, but yet you keep eating anyway?  Ever had it happen where an hour after you finish the meal you know you had no business eating you feel like your insides are fighting back from the absolute toxic nastiness you have forced upon your body?  Yeah....you know exactly what I am talking about.  Ghostly bile is forming in your throat now as you remember a meal just like this.   Pizza Palace may have turned me off of calzones for life.   ...other than that the service was decent and the decor was expected Vegas-themery.  The prices seemed a little high for the horrid sludge they put in front of you but then again I don't usually like to pay to be sick to my stomach."}
{"text":"If you like New York pizza (run by Italians) with real fresh dough (not frozen), fresh meat, and fresh veggies (again not frozen like the chains), Pizza Palace is your place.  The lunch time buffet turns over quick so the food is always fresh, pizza is always hot and delish.  They'll even sell you pizza dough if you want to make your own pizza at home."}
{"text":"An Italian restaurant in a Chinese casino?    It's just like North Beach, then!  Our quest for Chinese food took us to the Imperial Palace, but the Italian restaurant inside turned out to be perfect for us.  It was decorated like an Italian wine cellar, with the tuns of wine in the walls, old columns, the barrel vaulted ceiling.   Like we were deep inside a hillside.  Brick walls exposed through plaster finish.  A mural of Venice, for some reason.  It reminded me that everything on The Strip is a copy of something else.    The pizza was great.  The menu had all kinds of Italian food, and it was a very pleasant experience.  Dinner for two came to about $35."}
{"text":"Another one of my finds thanks to my time spent at IP's poker room. The lunch special is what got our attention, actually -- a giant slice of yummy pizza (don't get two slices unless you've an appetite of pro-football star proportions) for just a couple bucks.   It's a teeny-tiny little Italian restaurant, with checkerboard tabletops and comfy booths. The service is fast and friendly. I tend to catagorize it in my mind of being strictly a pizza joint, but the menu is actually much more extensive than that. They serve a chicken Caesar sandwich that's pretty good, though I vaguely remember the chicken being of the McNugget variety. They do have a little salad bar which offers plenty of tasty veggies and a couple meats, and a low-fat Italian dressing that I honestly can't taste the low-fattiness. It's thick and flavorful, just as it should be."}
{"text":"Cozy little restaurant. The pizza was tasty and the wings were pretty good. Great service!"}
{"text":"This is the most non-buffet buffet I have ever been to in my life. The writing is 92.5. There's one pizza on the buffet. And in chafing dishes they have some noodles and some hard garlic knots. I've never seen anything like this in my life"}
{"text":"My husband wanted some pizza before we went to the Divas show, so we stopped by here to pick him up a slice.  They were having a late night special, a slice and a beer (coors, yuck) for $5, which for the strip was a huge bargain.  However, the pizza was pretty greasy and gross.  Unless you're desperate for some really quick food, don't go here."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good and tasty although a little pricey. They do not offer any small or personal sized pizzas which is a bummer if you do not want the same toppings as others in your family.   I used to order from Pizza Palace regularly however they no longer accept credit card so I no longer order from them. Don't know why any restaurant would not accept credit card in this day in age!"}
{"text":"Tried the pizza & the sauces.  Didn't care for any of them.  Lacked seasonings or something.  On to the find a good pizzeria quest."}
{"text":"The waitresses were really nice, despite the fact that we had to wait 10 minutes to order our to-go. The pasta was delicious and exceptionally cheap ( $14 +). I ordered the seafood fettucini alfredo, and there was plenty of scallops, shrimps, and clams. I wouldn't mind dining here again."}
{"text":"A little pizza joint.  It was okay.  They offer an $8 buffet lunch with pizza, salad,wings, etc.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Given that the Pizza Palace is located at the Imperial Palace, I wasn't expecting much. I came here because it was convenient and quick or so I thought. The format was quite interesting. It shared a bar with 2 other restaurants, so the servers had to walk outside the restaurant to go get our drinks, which took forever.  Food: 2.5/stars 1) Combo pizza - vegetarian pizza with pepperoni and sausage. One of the greasiest pizzas I've ever had. The crust was burnt to the point where I could use it to knock someone out.  2) Sicilian-style fries - 4/5 Stars These are garlic parmesan fries. Awesome. Only good thing here.   Service: 2/5 Stars The service was horrible. It took forever to progress through each phase of our dining experience (getting seated, ordering drinks, appetizers, and entrees). The server did stop by several times, but only to tell us that she'll be right there.  She'll stop by again and say, your waters are coming. She'll stop by again and say your drinks will be ready."}
