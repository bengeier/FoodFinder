{"text":"Some of the best veg samosas I have ever had. The chicken biryaani was delicious as well."}
{"text":"This place has great East African food. It had a lot of variety African and Indian dishes. I had gone in August 2014 the owner who is a really friendly man and terrific customer service told me he was selling the business cause he is retiring I hope the new owner is as great.  I ordered the zanzibar mix, fried mhogo, beef samosas, chicken samosas , beef biryan, kachori, bhajia.  I only wished they had mishkaki and I would have given them 5 stars. I cannot wait to go back again."}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly and customer service is top. Delicious Haleem and Zanzibar mix! Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I just came back from a mission trip to Tanzania and I was craving for our camp cook's samosas. Timely, I found an article from the Toronto Star - recommending this place. I went right away and overall, it did not fail. The samosas reminded me of Tanzania. It was 99.9% similar to what we used to have; meaning it's authentic. I brought my family with me so they can taste the Tanzanian flavor that I've been raving about. It did not disappoint. They loved it as much as I did! BTW, don't forget to get all the dips that they offer. My personal favourites are the tamarind and coconut dips. Another menu recommendation is their beef keema and kabab. Again, you will love it. It is just so flavourful! Each dish is perfect to pair up with rice or even to just eat it by itself. Regarding the service, the owners are very friendly and we had a great time conversing in Swahili (they both came from Tanzania). I love them both.   P.S. There are no seats for dine-in. (hopefully when they get more patrons, they will provide seating for dine-in customers)."}
