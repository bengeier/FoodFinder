{"text":"All i can say is this place has the BEST shawarma and falafel around. They make all the sauces and the falafel from fresh ingredients, hummus and garlic are amazing!! Especially with the little snacks they have for you while you wait in line!! The owner and his friend Kris are so nice to talk with and always with a smile!!!
 Be sure to try this hidden treasure out - you will not be dissappoineted!!!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place and saw the big sign for a 2-for-2.99 deal you only find on College St downtown.  When I pulled into the parking, the small print read 2 for 2.99 \"each\" which is no sale at all.  This is very misleading advertising.  I felt ripped off even before I walked in there.  The place looked cheap, adding to the feeling they may nickel and dime you, and seeing what others got while I was waiting in line, I left as this place.  Walked right over to Regino's where I know the pizza is good.  For a place that starts off with deceptive advertising, that should be your first sign to keep driving."}
{"text":"A local gem in aurora, good food at a good price.  I am not from aurora but when i am i be sure to stop by this place to get a chicken shawarma.  Forget going to subway, try get some local food.  

I am a big fan of this place, and even in line when u get the food there are free snacks you can eat!! The pita they use must be homemade since it is so good"}
