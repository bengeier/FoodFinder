{"text":"I love Rice and Noodle.  For that hole in the wall but good comfort chinese food feel, this is your place.  Love the dim sum!  Har gow, sticky rice, sweet pork bun also known as Bao.  Love the egg fried rice and Shanghai Noodles.  Those are my fav dishes.  Other stuff is good too, I'll let you discover your own favorites.  Good, hot, cheap, fast, yummy, what else does chinese food need to be?"}
{"text":"This place is incredibly cheap but the food has very little flavour... If you want to fill your tummy on the cheap and are in a rush, come here, but for good food go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Friendly greeting when I walked in for my order, food smelled fresh and I could easily see the kitchen and our meal being boxed (clean space). Food was fresh, great flavours, crisp veggies, firm, not mushy noodles.  Steer clear of the pad thai, it's just \"ok\" and you can better somewhere authentic. Shanghai and Singapore noodles are awesome- spicy, lot's of flavour.  Our new take out spot (10% off when you pay cash for pick up)"}
{"text":"Being Chinese Canadian, I am very discerning about my Chinese food. I was in the area visiting friends and we all decided to order Chinese food. We ordered the crispy orange beef, Shanghai noodles and spring rolls. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and authenticity. The orange beef was perfectly battered, crispy and tart. The Shanghai noodles has perfect Ho fun noodles with a a great al dente texture. I could swear these spring rolls are homemade. Good food, great value! I will be back. Doe jay!"}
{"text":"This place is a local fave because it is cheap, cheap, cheap!  We normally get delivery because the restaurant itself is very small and pretty bare-bones.  Not the sort of spot you would want to bring a date.  The delivery service is typically fast and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"I like the wonton soup and that's about it....the rest looks really greasy as does every wall in the place.  I suggest a power wash for the entire resto."}
{"text":"Ok generic chinese food. Noodles were really good but the rice was dry. Came on a friday night and service was quick and friendly"}
{"text":"This place seems to have been in Parkdale for ages, but that doesn't mean it's actually good. It is however, quite cheap during their lunch special times. Outside of those hours you're looking at around $10 or higher for most items.  The only thing I can safely recommend is the Singapore Noodles. For $12.50 you get a nice sized serving of tasty curried noodles.  It's nothing to rave about, but I haven't come across any other good chinese food in this area either so I'll go with the 3 star review all in all."}
{"text":"With this place, I feel torn.  Torn because the food is excellent but the customer service is unbelievably bad.  The first time I went here, the lady heard the bells ring as I walked through the door, and she did not acknowledge me for at least two minutes. It was the lady with the 80s mushroom hair.  Then she came out and I ordered a combo, wanting to sub in fried rice for the plain steamed rice.  She was quite snippy with me for this request.  Has no one done this before lady?!?! The bill skyrocketed to over $10 by doing so.  Then I asked for extra hot sauce and she was like, \"I already gave you one!!\"  I've never understood the stingy hot sauce packet thing; they're a dime a dozen. AND i tipped so it shouldn't have been a problem.    Anyway, after that I was like, forget this place, and forget that lady.  There's so much food on Queen West, I don't need a side of sass with my meal.  Went home and ate the food and not one grain remained. The Kung-pao chicken was unbelievable.  That  chicken's death was not in vain It was sooo good I'll deal with her attitude, I don't care. In fact, I'm going there right now. Five Stars!!    update - OMG I really did go to R&N following this review, and I just ate my general tao and rice and now I can't go back there.  I'm totally heartbroken by this weird fluffly spongey general tao chicken. Blech! U just can't be chicken! You can't!! At best this meat probably comes from a fine dynasty of badgers.  Also the rice was all clumped together all mushed up.  This shrimp was yellowish and it's texture was the same as mars bar nougat. ALSO they gave me two fortune cookies but only ONE packet of hot sauce! You've GOT to be kidding me! U thought two adults would be cool to share ONE packet of hot sauce?!? Only babies share stuff and I don't know any hot sauce baby enthusiasts!! I just don't understand what the heck going on behind that curtain.  I'm so over this food and that mushroom lady."}
{"text":"We've been ordering delivery from Rice & Noodle for at least 15 years. It was reasonably priced, the portions were good, the food tasted ok, and they have free delivery. However, after last night, we won't be in any rush to order from them again.  Wonton soup- DO NOT EVER ORDER THIS. The worst wonton soup I've ever had. I literally spat it out after taking a bite of the wonton. No spice/flavour in the broth or pork. To top it all off, the pork inside the wonton was still pink. It tasted off. Threw it in the garbage.   Beef chow mein- came with tofu for some reason? And about 5 slices of beef and some water chestnuts. For $11? Really?  Hot and sour soup- extremely oily.  Spicy crispy squid- used to be one of our favourites. They changed the batter. It used to be light and would actually coat each piece of squid. Last night's order of squid was mostly hard batter that ended up falling off the very little actual squid that we did get. It was hard and hurt my jaw trying to eat it. Very disappointing.  Spring rolls- these were okay. Hard to screw up a spring roll though.  Waste of $50."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" is right.  I've ordered from this place regularly since moving to Parkdale but while the prices have steadily gotten higher, the portions have gotten smaller.  The food used to be consistently good but lately...not so much.  For a place that doesn't clean their seafood properly and charges for lemon wedges to squeeze over the filth, it's just not worth the trouble anymore."}
{"text":"A long-established family-run Chinese restaurant in south Etobicoke.  Decent value for the money.  Good variety.  Friendly staff.  It's where I go if I want a quick hit of Chinese food without breaking the bank."}
