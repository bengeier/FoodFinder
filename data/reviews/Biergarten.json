{"text":"A much needed addition to Pitt! Another rooftop to choose from :) it's like an upscale Hofbräuhaus which serves mainly pretzels and beers. They have random games on every table which is pretty cute!"}
{"text":"Been here for beer and private events. Jesse the bartender kills it! Love the views at golden hour. Cheers"}
{"text":"This was the exactly the type of place we were looking for. The weather was nice so we wanted a place where we could sit outside and have a few drinks. Our waitress was super friendly and gave great advice on which beers to try. We had the giant pretzel with the beer cheese and it was outstanding. Probably the best pretzel and beer cheese combo I've ever had. The only downside was that my wife wanted a Bloody Mary and they were out of tomato juice. We also wanted to try their roasted nuts, but they were out of those too. Overall I would recommend this place for a fun place to hang out, drink beers, and have an appetizer."}
{"text":"I went here during a sort of \"pre-screening\" of the place last week and was overall impressed.   The small amount of food offerings are pretty tasty and unique, but I feel like they sort of fell flat on the presentation. I wouldn't mind seeing them tweak a few of the dishes so it seems like you are getting your money's worth. However, for German \"street food\", it was all pretty great.  The beer selection is what I was most interested in and it did not fail me. The menu had a large selection of cans, bottles, and drafts all reasonably priced (for a 9th floor rooftop beer garden in Downtown). Most bottled beers were priced $8-12 with a few hitting $18. Draft beer was also in the same $8-12 ballpark. The menu also had a few cocktail offerings, but they were mostly based on beer and did not appeal to me.  The atmosphere was pretty great. Having been in the building during the previous tenancy, it was nice to see how they changed and decorated it to accommodate the beer garden. On the 9th floor, you're well above all the traffic and commotion coming from William Penn Place below and also get some great views around the city skyline.  The majority of the tables seemed to be made for 6+ people, so if you're there on a date and the place is packed, you might not get the intimate setting you're hoping for. It seems like they are going for a more communal style seating, but I do believe there were a few smaller tables set up as well.  They did have some games set up which was a nice touch. Giant Jenga, a large Connect Four type game, and some sort of two player puzzle-style game where it seemed like the object was for you and a teammate to use two strings and a plastic holder to get a ball to the top of a wall full of holes without losing it. There were two of those games side by side, so it seems like it could have been a nice competitive co-op game against another team.  As for the staff, most of the servers/waiters seemed new, but they definitely did their research on the menu before starting. Our waiter, although a bit shy or awkward at first, was able to make great beer suggestions for us as we stared at the seemingly never-ending list in front of us. He also allowed us to taste test some of the beers before we made our final decisions. Most of the beer we had paired very well with the food we had ordered.  So, overall I rate this place 5 stars as I feel it is a wonderful addition to the Downtown beer scene while offering it's own unique style. Being outdoors and on the 9th floor really sets it apart from the other places around Downtown. I will definitely be going back in the future and look forward to it doing well."}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of blah. Funny as I pull this up and Yelp mentions that it's Closed as I'm sitting here waiting forever for my check. Beers are over priced. Hell, high life cost $6! The rooftop is great. But it's nestled in-between several buildings and has absolutely no decor. Service isn't bad, so I'm not 2--starring this for that. Just that this place is nothing special whatsoever."}
{"text":"Checked this place out last night.  Overall it was a awesome atmosphere and a welcome addition to the downtown scene.  I am a sucker for outdoor spaces and this place was awesome.  They have outdoor games to play including giant Jenga and connect four.    The beer list is extensive with a nice draft list and a long bottle list.  The beer itself is on the pricey side with Yuengling being the cheapest option at 7 bucks.  We tried the pretzels with beer cheese.  They were quite good.  We also tried the \"mixed crazies...er..nuts\" and were somewhat disappointment by how finely minced the nuts were.  It was like someone took trail mix, put it in a slap-chop and then served it in a small sardine can.  During the warmer summer months this place will be unbeatable in terms of ambiance, though they would benefit from having some heat lamps for chillier nights.  Compared to Il Tetto, this place is smaller, more open, and does not have a long bar to sit at."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. It was incredibly small. The beer counter was awkward to stand in line to, and it took forever. There isn't that big of a choice for people who do not drink the beer. The place had 1 tv. And no music. It did have Jangas which was cool. We played with a random couple. The placed closed at midnight. There is deff better places in downtown !!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to see what the buzz was about with the new beer garden after the Arts Festival. The weather was a bit rainy earlier and we were told they wouldn't be opening that day. The weather seemed fine and so we decided to call back, lo and behold they were indeed open. When we arrive they were at max capacitor and so we left our name with the bouncer outside and headed downstairs to the Commoner for a drink while we waited. It's extremely convenient they've adapted to technology and have automated texts when it's our time.   The beer list was extensive. As to be expected from a BEER garden. They also had a food menu of two different \"wurst\" which in general to me were average. The sauerbraten was delicious though. Their potted pork was a sort of pate as well served cold - also delicious. The wait staff seemed pretty busy but everyone was very pleasant. My favorite part was the giant board games. Giant jenga, connect four, and some mystery game that I had no idea what it was. Each table also had its own jenga stack.   The space was a bit smaller than I thought it would be and really wished the building was taller. It would be awesome looking down instead of looking up at the buildings surrounding the area. Otherwise, the atmosphere was nice. It was cozy and very chill - definitely for the more laid back personality. The background music was more a ambient kind of vibe rather than a loud, get the night started one. I personally preferred it. Overall opinion is it's a place with a lot of potential and I wouldn't mind coming back again for a quieter night."}
{"text":"Biergarten is a unique place to visit for drinks in the warmer months. As the name may suggest, it is an outdoor space and is open only in the warmer spring, summer, and fall months. That said, it is still a great place to check out during these times!  It is located at the top of Hotel Monaco, which is also an incredible space. There is a view of some of the city, but not much. The beer selection is great and there is something for everyone. It's not very large and space can be limited if there is a large crowd. We had to wait about 10-15 minutes on one occasion due to the number of people that were already on the rooftop. The prices can be a little steep but not worth avoiding if you are looking for a unique experience. They also have games to play at the table and a giant Jenga set. Definitely a cool place to be when it's hot outside!"}
{"text":"German Beer and food with a good view; nothing more. Check in process is clumsy and awkward. You check in next to valet, and they give you no info about what is inside (crowd, wait time, etc)."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a few drinks with friends on a nice warm day or evening. A group of friends met here on a Saturday for a girls day. I wish there were more tables that you could separate because we had to sit in between two different couples on the middle of a bench/group table and it was a little awkward. Drink menu was average- absolutely was able to find something I wanted, but I wasn't overly impressed with the selection either.   If you have some time to kill before really kicking your night off I would 100% recommend stopping for a drink! I didn't look at a food menu so I'm not sure if they have one or what would be on it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a super chic outdoor bar space - this.is.it. I haven't experienced a place like this anywhere else in Pittsburgh.   Start by riding the elevator up to the 9 floor of Hotel Monaco to access the Biergarten. On the patio you'll see a variety of tables - seated and cocktail. It's super modern vibe is enhanced by the crowd it attracts. The patio was filled when we arrived around 5:30, luckily we grabbed a table. The first thing I noticed is the table games. We had Bananagrams and Jenga on our table and had a full size Jenga near by. Seriously cool addition to your typical happy hour conversation.   Our server created us right away to take our drink order. The menu is extensive with a combination of cocktails, wines and beers. They have several frozen cocktails on the front page which immediately caught my attention. Take my word - Frozé. I could literally frozé all day here.   They don't have a lot of small plate options, but we did try almost everything they offer. My favorite was the pretzel with beer cheese. How can you go wrong? The pretzel is huge and perfect for sharing. A close second is the cheese board. It comes with a variety of mustard and pickled vegetables. Don't get me wrong, I do think it's overpriced for the little variety you get, but I love pickled vegetables.   Moral of the story - if you are looking for cheap drinks and eats for happy hour this is not your spot.  Choose The Biergarten if you are looking for an evening of elevated fun."}
{"text":"Fun rooftop spot with a good beer selection and great pretzels. I enjoyed the atmosphere and there was also games to play while you eat and drink. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I just took one star because they were out of a good number of their draft selection. This could be a rare occurrence, but I am not sure. Overall a great place to drink good beers and have fun."}
{"text":"Cool spot, friendly staff, delicious bevs. We've been here twice on our trip and had a great time."}
{"text":"A bit understaffed. Pretty view. Line for capacity on busy nights. Pretty reasonable pricing. Good tap list. Selection on whisky."}
{"text":"Meh.  In theory, this place should be awesome.  A fancy rooftop beer garden sounded incredible...  But it's way too hip (the humongous boardgames are not a selling point for me) and way too pricey to be a place I'd go to a regular basis.  If you're staying at the hotel, then maybe check it out.  If they added some special beers that I couldn't get elsewhere, I'd come again.  But with Pittsburgh's beer scene so good right now, this is not a place I'd visit again.  There's not even a good view of the city from here.  To give an idea of prices: it runs from low end of Bud Light for $8 to mid-level of Victory Monkey Boy also for $8 to high end of Ayinger at $12.  On the plus side, the service was nice and the ladies room was gorgeously decorated."}
{"text":"So much fun, great beer, games like Jenga, connect four and banana grams to play. Communal seating, best pretzel with mustard and cheese I ever had. You need to come here. Put your phone down and talk to people."}
{"text":"I met up with family at the Biergarten for drinks and it was a great experience.  Friendly staff, great location and yummy menu items and drinks were to be had.  I had a Wyndridge Dry Hop Apricot Cider (my first) and it was delicious - I had several LOL I ordered the pickle plate, the cheddar board, the fried pickles and several orders of the rosemary maple glazed nuts.  The food was great - all very tasty and well prepared and presented.  The only downside was that the curry wurst wasn't available but it didn't stop us from having a great afternoon of food and drinks.  Highly recommend - especially if staying at the Hotel Monaco as I was!"}
{"text":"Great view. Decent beer and wine list. Lousy food. Terrible service. Seriously. After ordering, we waited 15 minutes for drinks and 40 minutes for an underwhelming cheese plate. I'm a generally a go-with-the-flow person but was this ridiculous even for me."}
{"text":"I've really been wanting to go to this place after hearing about it and now that I've finally made it... meh, not all that special. Yes they do have a very nice list of beers to try, but a lot of places have that nowadays. What I was really going for was the atmosphere. While this is a rooftop bar as promised, it is a bit small and the view is not really all that great. So that was a little disappointing. On the other hand, I did enjoy both the beers and the appetizers that I on a warm summer evening.  I would go back again but just not be as excited about it as I was before."}
{"text":"Completely underwhelming. Great spot on a rooftop but.... 6 things in the menu, 1 that I could eat w diet restrictions and allergies and they didn't have it 2 hours into opening. We were told \"if you're around later...\" Then I got a Froze and found half the glass was simply solid ice chunks.... so $40+ to have my spouse eat a bratwurst and get two drinks (1 beer, one ice with a splash of cocktail). Will not return."}
{"text":"We were staying at the hotel for a business trip when they had their soft opening. We went twice, the first night and second. I hope they've gotten into a better rhythm because the service was terribly slow. The servers were nice, but it took us hours just to grab a couple of drinks and apps. I like the games and think this could be a fun place if they work out the kinks."}
{"text":"The rooftop bar is pretty cool but the beer is crazy overpriced. I love the idea of rooftop bars but there has to be at least a couple cheap options I think. The pretzel appetizer was pretty good but I ended up with a hefty bill for just a couple of beers and one appetizer. I would recommend this for the pretty view and atmosphere mostly."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to write a review on a place that mainly focuses on drinks. There is only so much you can say, but not at biergarten. I was really blown away by not only the atmosphere, but by the taste of my frozen drink and pretzel I ordered to \"snack\" on.   First things first, biergarten sits up on the 9th floor of hotel monaco (which is a really unique hotel). It wasn't too packed for a busy Saturday night in Pittsburgh (pride/arts festival), thankfully. No one likes waiting for drinks, let's face it. It was definitely a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but still set up in a way that didn't make you feel smothered. They also have jenga on each of the tables and connect four. My friends and I really had a great time playing!   I ordered the pretzel and absolutely LOVED it. I have had a lot of pretzels in my day and that one was so soft. I am not sure how they make their pretzel dough, but they are doing something right!   For my drink, I ordered the Frosecco which was frozen and had Zonin Prosecco, Havana Club Añejo Blanco, White Peach, and Lime. I loved this and could have kept drinking them all night. The only thing that stopped me was the $14 price tag. Totally worth it in my opinion though. That is one thing to keep in mind about this place is you will end up forking up a lot of cash.   If you are looking for a classy rooftop to find yourself on, check out biergarten! If you are worried about parking, no worries they can valet your car for you. Just call the hotel for pricing."}
{"text":"What a cool place to have drinks! There is nothing else like it. The views are wonderful. They have frozen drinks which were delicious. In addition they have a large selection of beers. It was a little pricey but well worth it. Oh and they have table games!"}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks in the city when it's warm weather! The Biergarten is on top of Hotel Monaco and provides a great view of the city. I would recommend going at happy hour for a drink and some pretzels! Or go around sunset for a great view! Overall, this is a fun space with a very extensive drink menu!"}
{"text":"The view was nice, rooftop location is unique, but boy was the staff horrible. No one greeted us. We wandered around trying to figure out whether we seat ourselves, ask for a table, order drinks from a bar window that appeared to be staff-only, etc. finally interrupted someone at the window who said you can sit wherever and order from a waitress or at the window. During our look at the beer menu at the window, we were treated to an argument between a manager and an employee about hours, shifts, pay, etc which included use of the F word. I see no need to return here."}
{"text":"Beer--5 stars. Food--3.5 stars. I'll give them 4 stars for overall impression. Been here twice with friends. The rooftop atmosphere is really great on a nice day (my only complaint is the flat-screen TV that does not fit the atmosphere and is very distracting). They serve different styles of beer in their proper containers. Large selection to choose from. The food was ok. I liked the giant pretzel. Main complaint is the small selection of food items and the smaller-than-expected portion size. I would come back again for the beer and atmosphere."}
{"text":"this review is based on drinks only!! Great view up top, perfect for a nice sunny day. Service was good, beers were expensive but tasty. They had a very large selection of beer and drinks! I would come back again."}
{"text":"First of all, rooftop bars in Pittsburgh are all around awesome. Nonetheless, Biergarten is pretty small with very little places to stand if you can't find a seat. They have a great selection of beers and are located in a pretty awesome hotel as well. We had a great time and I definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"So this is a bit of a mixed review for me. I like rooftops (and skylines), and finding a cool rooftop bar in downtown Pittsburgh was a dream come true.   Beirgarten is on the 9th floor. Once you get off the elevator, it's to your right. You can't miss it. You seat yourself on giant communal wooden picnic tables, which I really like. It's great to chat with new people! The snacks and the mixed drinks, like the frozè and frosecco, are great. It's so trendy that I hate to love it (but I love it).   A couple of cons about the place--when it's busy, it's almost impossible to flag down someone to order drinks, or to get your checks.  When you deviate from the menu, the servers seem to struggle a bit. My friend had to have her simple drink remade twice. Also, in terms of vodka choices, they only have Smirnoff or Grey Goose?!?!  The pros--good drinks off the menu, great soft pretzels, skyline view--definitely outweigh the cons for me personally. I'll be back to enjoy some more froseccos!"}
{"text":"What a great little spot in downtown Pittsburgh! I've been to Biergarten two times now and overall I have nothing bad to really say about the place. My first visit we went late on a Saturday so we did have a wait to get in but the Commoner bar is right downstairs and if you don't finish your drink down there you are allowed to bring it up with you. It was decorated with strung up lights and the atmosphere was great. No annoying, young, and drunk college kids. It was a nice mix of people probably in their upper 20's up to people probably in their 60's. While the view isn't of anything super fantastic it's still awesome.  I ordered the pickle plate and a large pretzel. The pretzel is a must every time I visit and it never disappoints. I would highly recommend getting one or two to share depending on how many people are in your party. While the pickle plate wasn't bad it definitely wasn't out of this world by any means.   My second visit was on a Friday after work for happy hour with some friends. The place wasn't as crowded so I was actually able to check out where the life size games were. We also discovered they have jenga sets for the tables!   If you are looking for a new place to try in the summer months I would definitely recommend you check out Biergarten."}
{"text":"Really cool spot for a date night or happy hour! This chic rooftop bar is on top Hotel Monaco in downtown Pittsburgh. My husband and I came here for some date night drinks because I heard that they had Froze! Soooo delicious and did not disappoint. Perfect summertime drink! They have a lot of different beers and other cocktails as well. The food menu is limited but we had a soft pretzel that was huge and yummy. I would probably eat beforehand next time only because I was not aware the menu was smaller with mostly snack type items.  They have games like Jenga & scrabble you can play as well. I cannot wait to come back on a nice summer night!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, wish it was a little bit bigger.  The beer selection is generally good and unique.  Been a few times though when it was a bit off which is kind of annoying.    The food here is odd.  However, despite the weird choices, they have a killer Bavarian pretzel.  They are fresh made, huge and the beer cheese accompaniment is delish!"}
{"text":"This place is set up to be a fun time a great hangout, but it's got a few short comings. I've visited about 3 times and every time I do visit they have run out of a significant amount of beers and food items on the menu. For example on my latest visit my BF tried to order a beer 3 times. Each time he ordered the waiter came back 5 minutes later saying that they were out of that beer. Three times! And they didn't offer any sort of discount or free beer for the total run around and let down. Why didn't they communicate up front what was out of stock? The waiter was discovering a dead end with every order - seems like poor behind the scenes communication.    The original reason we were visiting that day was for the summer trend of Frozé & Frosecco. We arrived around 6pm on a Friday in August and they didn't have their feature promo ready yet. What?! That's prime time! We waited an hour before being served half frozen versions of the cocktails. They also weren't served with the festive flower decorations that were pictured across their promotions :(  the fun was sucked out of our fun summer friday happy hour.   The place does have great location, fun rooftop, fun selection of beer (if you can pick one they actually have) and does serve the most delicious german pretzel.  It's more of a fluffy, buttery croissant - than a pretzel. And thats what makes it delicious. I will return - for the pretzel."}
{"text":"If I were rating this in terms of hotel bars, my rating would be much higher, but as a local who loves rooftop bars, there are many other better options. Last time I went, it was on a sunny afternoon and the majority of the seating is in direct sunlight, so it wasn't a relaxing atmosphere and I wanted to leave after my first drink. Overall, the lack of actual \"bar\" makes it feels like it should be a pop-up beer garden, similar to what I've been to in other cities, but the drinks are too pricey and it just feels like it was an afterthought in the hotel that they never fully finished."}
{"text":"Awesome pretzels, awesome jenga with dares written on them, AND awesome service. I came with my friends but I have the worst cold ever and the server went down to the lobby and brought me up different teas & hot water! I am so grateful & pleased!"}
{"text":"I spent the night at Hotel Monaco Saturday 8/6/16. After enjoying a complimentary beer in the living room, I headed up to the rooftop deck to for another drink.  While the prices are a buck or two more than I'd like to pay, the ambience made up for it.  It's a super-cute little space with some round tables and a couple of traditional Biergarten-style long tables with benches.   While I didn't get to try any of the food, every order that came past my table looked delectable.   The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They made the experience pleasurable, even though the place was packed and they were all running around like crazy.   Unless you're staying at the hotel, I probably wouldn't recommend hanging out for more than a beer or two, but it's certainly a place to try at least once."}
{"text":"As the summer wraps up and the weather becomes chillier, I can't help but think about the good times I've had at Biergarten.  I love this place. Chill, nice atmosphere, communal tables, yummy snacks (and omg is that giant pretzel giant!). The drinks are a bit pricey but hey, this is a classy place!  AND fun little games like Jenga, oversized Jenga, and oversized Connect Four.  I saw a couple go on a first(?) date here and it is definitely a perfect date spot, but also one where you can go with a group of friends and actually hear each other and enjoy each other's company.  Biergarten, we may not see each other for awhile, but I will be thinking of you until we meet again! :)"}
{"text":"Great before a Pens game. Rooftop bar with a view. Friendly staff. Cold microbrews on tap and fresh hot pretzels etc."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with saying I am not a huge drinker, so I can't totally comment on the selection...however, a big bonus that the friendly and helpful staff helped me find a beer that was delicious and I drank the whole thing!  (FYI, it takes me a long time to drink beer and I very rarely drink an entire beer, so this is a very good thing to find something I would drink all of in an appropriate amount of time)!  My co-worker who was with me, commented on how great the selection was (she really likes beer and knows much more about than I do).  We also got a soft pretzel to share...OMG it was so yummy!!!!!  A little expensive, but great atmosphere and a fun place to check out if you are in Pittsburgh and want to stop in for a snack and a few drinks!"}
{"text":"Expensive snacks on a roof deck with no view or atmosphere ... or service. The kids with Biergarten tshirts were too busy talking with each other (sitting at their own table) to realize the rest of us wanted to eat, drink, or pay tabs. The roof is sterile - no plants, painted mural is cute for a minute, ugly building dominates view. Lots of better roofs on which to enjoy a summer drink - and better food (pretzel & potato pancakes ok, mussels were a joke - fewer than 9 chewy spicy rather than smoked mussels served out of shell in a little sardine tin)."}
{"text":"I love rooftops! And this one does not disappoint.  Located on the 9th floor on top of the Monaco hotel, the Biergarten is spacious but gets busy, so don't delay if you are going here for happy hour in nice weather! The space is filled with long communal tables and they have various games, which is unique and a good way to unwind after work.  The beer selection is (of course) quite extensive and everyone should be able to find something that appeals to them. They cover a broad range of varieties and price points. The beers I have tried here have all tasted fresh and it seems like they take good care of it. Nothing worse than stale, old beer!  If beer isn't your thing, they also have a selection of cocktails. I have had their Moscow mule, which was excellent and full of gingery spice.  I have not yet tried any of the available snacks, but the giant soft pretzel was quite tempting and I will probably give in on my next trip. We're quickly approaching not-so-nice weather season, so stop in before it's too late!"}
{"text":"So the hours were off (even though EVERYTHING on the Interwebs is TRUTH) and we rolled up to the 9th floor to be met with a bunch of staff waiting on a manager to open the place. No worries, we just rode right on down to the Commoner and had fantastic cocktails made by the best kind of bartenderess - knowledgeable, generous with her suggestions and nips of the weirder kind of bitters and gins we sampled. 30 minutes later we were met with the open Biergarten and a doorman who carded both my early-late 30s self and my early-late 60s mother (thanks, love).   What a lovely slice of the Pittsburgh skyline! The place was somehow packed in the 10 minutes it was open before we got there; the atmosphere festive and the dark beer plentiful (don't worry, there's a small but solid wine and cocktail selection, too). The crowd was diverse - a Sperry-clad bachelor party, a group of old men who were possibly Bernie (from Weekend at Bernies), some beautiful Yinzers on dates and my parents and myself. The big games were fun, the staff was warm and the whole scene just felt full of possibilities. I can imagine ending all my summer first dates on this roof. Same floor bathrooms with serious AC - bonus on this swarmy, steamy night.   PS: In their first two weeks, the security guard had not yet seen another guest get the mega Jenga as high as my folks and I managed to stack it sans topple!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the atmosphere was great! I loved he rooftop, it was a fun time with all the games. However, it was so hot and there were no fans or umbrellas, and it was almost 90 degrees. The heat was almost unbearable, and I'm glad we only stayed for one drink. I would like to go back again at a different time in the day. It was also a little bit pricey for a beer, you were definitely paying for the ambiance. We also got two giant pretzels to share. They were just okay, and the cheese sauce was flavorful, but had a weird texture. I would go back for just one drink, and on a cloudy day or later in the evening when I didn't feel like I was going to sweat to death."}
{"text":"Eh...I was under impressed. Stopped twice last summer. Sure it's fun to drink on a roof and play Jenga (maybe on that part). Just overrated. With so many great breweries and tasting rooms and bars in Pittsburgh this one is just ok."}
{"text":"My friend and I spent almost an entire day evening here we loved the atmosphere & drinks so much. We loved the frozen cocktails & rosé cidre. Skip the pimento spread and go for the pretzel! Will return."}
