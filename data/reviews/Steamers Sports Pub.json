{"text":"A gem of a dive bar for true football fans. Steamers has taken a step above most bars and has dedicated rooms and areas for game fans. The main teams that Steamers has dedicated areas for are the Philadelphia Eagles, Pittsburgh Steelers, Carolina Panthers, Miami Dolphins, and the Cleveland Browns. On game day you can not find a better atmosphere other than being at the actual game. They have great drink specials, particularly on buckets of beer. Their quesadillas, fried green beans, and open face roast beef sandwiches are just a few of my favorite menu items, on a side note it always tastes the same great consistency. However, even if you don't like football or if it is the offseason they have plenty of pool tables, darts, corn-hole, karaoke, and trivia to keep you busy."}
{"text":"My favorite \"towny\" bar. Great wings and pricing in beer. Perfect to watch all things sports (tvs everywhere!)"}
{"text":"Thursday, $11.99 for a pound of crab legs with a salad and hush puppies. I challenge you to find a better deal for snow crab legs in this area.   I live right around the corner and have been here quite a few times, I am not a regular but do find myself yearning for a visit on Thursdays for the crab legs special.  They have a slew of televisions, friendly staff, good beer selections (sweet water 420 on tap) and a fairly extensive menu. Give it a try, you just might find yourself a good time here."}
{"text":"I have been to the bar a total of 3 times and every visit has been decent.  They have great specials,cheap drinks,a gizillion tv's to watch sports on sundays.....They have a philadelphia eagles room for eagles fans!!!!!! and a steelers room for Steelers fan!!!!!!!!!!.  This place gives you a smaill town bar vibe but the people are friendly and the employees remember your names after a few visits!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"From the service with Lauren to the cleanliness of this place I am thoroughly impressed !!!! Food was awesome can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Rude - racist - bar owner that treats his staff like shit...nothing prepared in house and poorly run.... absolutely awful...."}
{"text":"Great sports pub!  Wings are a definite must have.  Tons of TVs to catch all your favorite games.  Staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Went on a very busy day but the staff was friendly and the food was very good. I tried the chipotle chicken quesadilla and their hot wings. Both were very good. I'm only giving it 4 stars because it took forever to even get a place to sit and we had to share a table with a nice couple."}
{"text":"Cool place to watch sports. TV's everywhere. Good food and good drink prices.  My buddy and I went to watch a Nascar race there and they even put the sound on for us in our own section. They have pool tables, darts and karaoke some nights. NFL Sundays this place gets packed. I've only been three times but plan to make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"If there is anything I love, it's a dive bar and though Steamer's isn't totally defined as one but it is my replacement to YesterYears.  The staff is spot on (especially Dave - Not only does he remember your name after the first visit, he hustles and provides attentive and thorough service).  The drinks are cheap and the atmosphere is fun.  The food isn't amazing... But it is a bar so you get what you would expect.  There is always a bunch of characters inside so get ready for an interesting experience.  I love Steamers and though it's a ways from my home and I won't be defined as a regular, I  will jump at the chance to have a chill night here!"}
{"text":"This place proves that the local sports bars are the best.   Top Three Reasons You're Going to LOVE This Place:  1. The energy in here is CRAZY!!! Everyone from the regulars to first timers are cheering and celebrating throughout the whole bar. First time? Don't worry the amazingly helpful staff will make you feel right at home.   2. There are TV's everywhere!!!! They line the walls and you can watch any games you want...if there's a game playing it's going to be on here. Just come prepared to cheer on your favorite team! And if you are a die hard fan, they have dedicated fan rooms...GO STEELERS!!!   3. Great drink and food specials!!! There are tons of beers on tap and on special and a great variety on the menu. My friends and I helped ourselves to some wings and fries and we were not disappointed.    If you haven't been here you are definitely missing out! So grab your favorite jersey and head on over to Steamers!!!"}
{"text":"Yeah that's right I'm giving steamers a 5 star review.  After the loss of Yesteryears I was in need of a new dive that was close to home and Steamers I can't believe I didn't know about you sooner.  I'm a dive bar girl and when I'm drinking I don't want anything fancy.  This place reminds me of the bar I worked at in college and I get a good vibe.  I have had great service the staff is very friendly, On my second visit the bartender already remembered my name...(and trust me I gave her no reason too the first time I visited lol)- but this place is true to what it is a neighborhood bar, serving it's regulars, tons of activities including darts, , karaoke, fooseball, as well as staples like cheap beer, and jello shots.  I know this will be my go to with the neighborhood folks from now on.  Haven't tried any food yet so I'll update once I know :)"}
{"text":"It's my favorite bar in Charlotte it's very blue collar, very relaxed. They have up'd their beer game with a wide selection of craft beers. Which I'm sure is surprising to most people when they walk in.  Speaking of surprises their food is quite good as well. Their fried food my not be good for your diet but it is so yummy. Fries, sweet potato fries, buffalo chip, onion rings and chicken egg rolls just to name a few fried foods worth a try."}
{"text":"I've honestly been looking for this place for the past 9 years living here in Charlotte. God bless Al Gore's internet and Yelp for this find.  I consider myself a mediocre social butterfly, so if there is a better dive bar in town I really do not know of it. Big fan dives. The coziness of the interior, along with bar food selection, and drink specials are phenominal.  TV's ALL OVER. You come here for football, I'd say you have a good chance of catching whatever game your looking to watch.  The food is good, not gastropub quality by any means. Drink specials seem more than decent.   That said, my favorite aspect to this bar- Friggin'. Eagles. Room. Love it. So yes, it would be accurate to say I'm an avid Eagles fan. This room was jampacked this past Saturday night for the Eagles loss against the Saints. (What's new, they blow it every year). But I did meet some real great people here, and we got to talk a little Eagles history. Not bad. You definitely won't find this anywhere else in the city, so if your an Eagles fan, MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!  Other information:  They also have a Steelers room.  Eagles room is actually fairly kid friendly."}
{"text":"Great dive bar find in Charlotte. Tons of TVs to watch all types of sports, but you definitely need to come here if you're an Eagles fan. The atmosphere here is unmatched to anything outside of Philadelphia.   They have a lot of great specials. Every night there's different drink and food specials and different activities like trivia or karaoke. It's definitely a fun place to come.   I don't necessarily ever come here for the food, but it gets the job done after having a few drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and always left with an unsure feeling. Tonight it took me all of 5 minutes to be lividly anger. Our server has told us that tonight because it is game night we are unable to have tap water and have to buy bottled water. Been here before and they serve tap water... hello this is the US not Europe! Don't be so desperate for money that you do that to guests on the ONE NIGHT you are busy. Also serving water to guest that are drinking keeps them buying more drinks, hello common sense!   Then there is the service... I have been here for 10 mins and our witness (EllenF) was so rude to us about waters, the table next to us said they ordered boneless wings and the witness said \"I wrote it down as you said it and that's not what you said so I guess I'll just take that out of my tip!\" Then she comes to take our order and I asked for the tater tot seasoning on the side and she told me \"man the kitchen is going to hate you\" WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU WOMAN! If you hate your job so much then change it but you can't talk to guest like that!!    We ordered 15 wings and tater tots with seasoning on the side. Our order came out with 11 wings. Mhm... interesting. They fixed this quickly but we also paid for 3 flavors and they did a combo of the 3 flavors on all the wings. Not good esp when someone is paying for extra flavors.   After our dinner we had a patron tell us they charge for waters on game day because some visitor team fans were coming in and ordering nothing but waters. Don't punish your locals for poor judgement on visitors."}
{"text":"umm..yea, all I will say is not-so-great.  For what it is, its expensive and the owner is a jerk."}
{"text":"Steamers is by far my favorite dive bar. They have really good food and they always have a good selection of crafts beers. I usually get the French dip but it's a really good French dip.   Atmosphere is super casual but the staff is super attentive. Also they have different drink specials everyday. This place is a win-win."}
{"text":"My father of 46 years old came by and his ID happened to be broken in half. He was not allowed to even get a drink. It's kind of crazy just because the server said he didn't even need to look at it bc my father looked of age. When the manager came by he immediately asked for my FOURTY-SIX year old father's ID. He made up some excuse and said he was SLURRING his words just so he wouldn't get I trouble. We immediately got thrown out. I will never be back."}
{"text":"I came to Steamers once before for a job, and I told myself if I ever needed to watch a game this is where I'm coming. This place is right around the corner from my house and well, lets say they have a lot of TV's. It's a sports pub, I didn't expect less. So I came here to watch the Knicks play because of an Asian American player Jeremy Lin play and I didn't receive the game at home.  I ate the Philly Cheese Steak. The waiter came and asked me if I wanted tomatoes and lettuce, and I did however when they came back they didn't have tomatoes and lettuce and they brought it out on a plate instead. The tomatoes were fine, but the lettuce looked a little old. I drank a couple of beers and watched the game. The place had some pretty good 90's music and a good amount of country.   My roommate who went with me ordered a burger and said it was juicy and well cooked, so I can't really comment on what his thoughts were. (However, he does have the credentials because he's a student at Johnson and Wales and works in a kitchen) After we ate our entree, we ordered the nacho supreme. It wasn't bad. the lettuce still wasn't that fresh, but the portion size was okay. At 10 every weekend they have karaoke night.  Overall, if I come back here, I would just order a beer watch the game (as they had so many TV's just ask what you want to watch and they'll get your own TV) and then go home. Maybe get some nachos as it's not expensive at all. I don't know what the first reviewer was talking about with the prices were expensive. I didn't think it was expensive at all, but actually not priced badly at all."}
{"text":"Before I begin, I have to say that five star reviews aren't something that I dole out like candy on October 31st, as I am very particular about granting an establishment the elusive five stars as there is nothing worse than going to a restaurant with five stars and soon thereafter you begin to wonder if you are actually in the right place (one of those \"maybe there is another location somewhere?\" type of moments).    Well, I am excited to say that Steamers has earned every single one of the five stars I am handing out and I can't believe I have actually found a sports bar to \"call home\"...  Last weekend, my 6 year old son and I were having some quality father/son time so we decided on the spur of the moment to find somewhere new to catch the Tarheels football game that was slated to kickoff at 12:30pm.    Now, we definitely enjoy the quality of life down in our neck of the woods in South Charlotte, but the sports bar options are mediocre at best and downright lame at worst, as sometimes it seems to take an act of congress to get a place to actually turn on a particular game (even if a place is practically empty), let alone play sound (why do they always seem to act shocked that people actually want to hear the game they are watching???).  So, now I always make sure to call a place beforehand to ask if they will be playing sound (although I have found that the response given is almost always yes, but then when we get there the sound is almost never turned on) as it drives me crazy to sit staring at a game with no sound (or even closed captioning), or even worse, with music playing in the background on a Saturday afternoon in a \"sports bar\".  Ok...now that I have that out of the way, let's get to the review of Steamers...  First, let me say that the drive wasn't as bad as I imagined it would be.  Smooth sailing all the way, no sitting in traffic, so the time flew by and we were there in no time.  It is actually set back a bit off the main road so if you weren't looking for it, you probably wouldn't even notice it, but believe me when I tell you it is definitely a place worth going out of your way to check out!  Walking in we were greeted by one of the managers and we felt right at home from the moment we walked in the front door.  I know this may sound cliché, but it had that Cheers vibe as everyone who worked there was very friendly and personable (without being intrusive or annoying).  Kinda felt like we were over at a friends house to catch a game, except none of my friends have close to 100 TV's!!!  Yes, you heard me...100 TV's...it was crazy and my 6 year old son was amazed at the sight (this is a great place for kids by the way as they were awesome with my little guy the entire time we were there and he gave it two thumbs up at the end of the day).   The coolest part was that they had different sections in the restaurant where you could have sound playing for one game and then in the section over there was sound playing for another game and you would never know it.    Yes, you heard me...THEY HAD SOUND!!!  In fact, they asked me what game I wanted to watch, pumped up the sound to the level I wanted and asked what games I wanted on around me too, it was awesome!  This place is everything a sports bar should be!  The manager said it doesn't matter what part of the country you are from and what team you are rooting for, he has enough TV's to make sure your game will be put on for you and he will get you SOUND!   This place has alumni viewing party central written all over it, as what more could you ask for???  And if that wasn't enough, they had plenty of pool tables, 3 Foosball tables, various video games (my son loves the putt putt golf game and actually scored a -2 for 18 holes!), lots of dart boards, and TV's...did I mention the 100 TVs??!!??!!  And believe it or not, they actually serve some pretty good food too!  We tried the nachos, quesadilla, wings, Philly cheese steak, and the cheesecake (hey, it was a guys day so we did it Cliff Huxtable style - token obscure TV reference often found in my reviews...this one refers to the episodes when he would pig out on the hoagies and chocolate soda when Claire was out of town) and all the food was definitely above average and priced very reasonably with better than average quality both in taste, promptness of service and overall experience.  The servers did a fantastic job from start to finish, always making sure my water was refilled without me having to ask and I never had to do the \"where is my server\" neck workout that many of us are all too familiar with.  The manager came by to check on us multiple times and even took the time to ask us for feedback which I thought was a nice touch.    This place was everything we could ask for in a sports bar...tons of TV's, family friendly atmosphere, great food, excellent service and a welcoming vibe that made us feel right at home...Welcome to the 5 star club Steamers..you definitely earned it!"}
{"text":"I am only giving this place one star because there is no 1/2 star option... we used to be regulars (no the food isn't that great it was just convenient so our average spending here was about $200 a week) on our latest experience tonight, one of our friends was refused service... he was NOT intoxicated, nor was he driving anywhere and he was accused of being \"drunk\".  Bartender asked how many he had and he accurately responded with \"two\" so she served him one... the second time around she refused to serve him stating he was over served... bad taste in my mouth and we will surely not be going back... we literally traveled 40 minutes to come back to one of our \"favorite bars\" and we surely won't be returning... the uber money isn't worth it for this trash!!!!!!!! I will say I noticed it was new staff and it was terrible... surely losing them lots of money! RIP steamers... it was sure great knowing ya"}
{"text":"Steamers is a local bar for me as I live in the area and while I don't go all the time I do enjoy a visit on a big game night.    We wanted a nice, friendly place with food where we could watch the Carolina/Duke game and Steamers was our first pick!  We arrived at game time, our orders were quickly taken and drinks arrived very quickly.  The food is decent bar food.  We had the homemade chips for an appetizer and sandwiches.  There was a nice rivalry going in the bar but everyone was having fun with it.  People were friendly, staff was quick.  I loved that they offer free trivia games at your table so during breaks in the game action I played a little trivia.  Overall, we had a lovely evening out and really enjoyed watching the big game in such a fun atmosphere.  I can't believe any reviewer would think this place was overpriced - we had full dinner for two complete with appetizer and drinks and the bill was less than $25.00 including tip!"}
{"text":"The best darts bar in Charlotte. Great TVs, the wings are very good, decent (not great) draft selection, bottles are on ice."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!!!! Racist and rude! Shelby and her waitstaff are disgusting and extremely rude!!! Food is good but the service from management is the absolute worst!"}
{"text":"Steamers Sports Pub is the official EAGLES fan club in Charlotte, fact. Once you get in, you'll see some Philadelphia Eagles decor in the pub. But world, I'm sorry I let you down. I went for the Philadelphia Eagles vs. Dallas Cowboys game last week, when the Eagles defeated the Cowboys 37 to 9, and I must say they weren't prepared for such a big crowd.    It was very busy, I mean very, VERY busy. - The fan area was packed, and the waitresses weren't nice with an attitude.  - The bar had only one bartender. - I ordered grilled chicken teriyaki wrap. I got it after more than 75 min, and it was ok.  Steamers is a typical bro sports bar, with probably over 100 TV, and few drinks specials. But I don't I'll be returning.   I should be giving them only 2 but the third one because they root for the Eagles in Charlotte.   Two and Half Yelps"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great place to try a new beer, grab some food and hang out. ESPECIALLY during football season.   The menu offers a ton of variety and can guarantee even the pickiest eater will find something they want to eat and will love.   The beer selection is bigger than expected and they offer great specials throughout the week that also make it affordable to buy \"higher end\" beer.   Bring a group of friends, relax and have a good time. That's what this place is made for!"}
{"text":"Wanted to find a new place that had good beer and every game i might want to see. Well... Excited doesn't even begin to describe me when I walked into Steamers. Sat down and found that thy have friendly staff and fellow patrons, and, pretty darn good food too. I will definitely be back! #divebar #clt"}
{"text":"Average sports bar. They have lots of TV's, mediocre atmosphere, bar food on the menu, and lots of bottled beer."}
{"text":"Steamers is a solid location, especially for football games! It's also, in my opinion, a hidden gem. We have gone past this place a few times and weren't really sure what it was all about. So we decided to stop by on a Friday for date night. The restaurant itself is huge and has a few separate rooms which is awesome! There are pool tables, dart boards, a million TVs, some video game like games, and much more! So there is plenty to do when just hanging out for the night. Plus they have karaoke!!! Yes please!  The food was typical bar food, nothing outstanding but good enough. And the drink prices were pretty reasonable as well which I definitely didn't mind! They have specials daily so be sure to check those out as well. Overall, I enjoyed Steamers and would definitely come back for a. It's convenience to our house and b. It's large quantity of tvs for football! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Home of the University of Louisville game watch parties for fans and alums of Charlotte. Typical bar food - wings, fried food, beer. I only come here for game watches and when I do stop in I get the sweet and spicy wings and the buffalo chips. The side room has TVs on pretty much every square inch of the room which make for great game watches."}
{"text":"Steamers is an amazing find.    It is a clean and open space with plenty of choice tables and bar seating!  Over 100 tv's!!!  Now that's what I call a Sports Bar!  My first time in and within five minutes I met TJ, Beth, Renee' & David and they were all friendly and welcoming.  Everyone of them made sure I was in front of the TV I needed to be in front of with sound!  Yay!  They have at least 3 separate areas for Pittsburgh fans, Philadelphia Fans and I think Miami, too.    I think they have a fairly nice patio also with plenty of tv's.  That's where the smokers are, so I didn't make it out there.  They also have free wi-fi, which is great!  The food was good, too.  Crinkle Cut French fries came with my Rueben Wrap.  The wrap was on the small side, but the flavor was big!  The Popcorn Shrimp were well-cooked and came to the table without being gooey with residual oil.  They were yummy.  They have drink & food special every day.  They also do trivia, karaoke and other fun things throughout the week.  I don't think it was very expensive, maybe a little high for a small sandwich, but not unusually priced for Charlotte.  I hope I can get back in for the CrabLeg Special - that's an awesome deal.  I'm definitely glad to have met this great group of people in a great place to go and hang for some sports!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first and last time going there. The food was subpar to say the very least. We came only intending to watch Game 7 of the World Series. We ordered an appetizer, loaded nachos or something, and it was literally a handful of nachos with microwaved cheese on the top, and sprinkled with shredded lettuce and a tablespoon of salsa. On the side was an ounce of sour cream and jalapenos. It looked disgusting. We ate 1-2 nachos and ordered the \"sampler tray appetizer\" hoping it would be better. It was not. The manager accused us of eating all of the nachos before sending them back and still charged us for \"half of the nachos\". The only upside of this place was the secluded back room specifically for those who wanted to watch the world series. Food was horrible, service was \"ok\", management was horrible. Just Horrible. This bar needs John Taffer from Bar Rescue immediately. They are also RACIST.! Is it ironic that the only 2 African American groups in the bar that night had an unsatisfactory experience. A separate and unrelated couple had a similar experience to us as far as how we were treated that night (We spoke outside the building while leaving). I was also told by a random employee that I could not wear my hoodie (black nike hoodie with big red NIKE word across the front) inside the building. Others at the table beside us even debated that this wasn't true because they are frequent goers of the establishment and never had that issue themselves. Our waiter also kept standing near our table for about 20 minutes after we received the tab; as if she was monitoring us to make sure we do not leave without paying (keep in mind that we came to watch the world series which had an hour left in the game).  I will never go here again. I felt targeted and uncomfortable. I had to finish the last inning of the baseball game at home.. WHERE I FELT MORE WELCOMED!"}
{"text":"Good food, great TV selections, alcohol and pool tables? Please tell me more. For years I had never been to this place until one day my Father wanted to go since he had been. When you walk in it feels like you are not in the city but more out in the country. I had heard the wings were good so why not check them out. I had gotten an order of their hottest wings and some sort of side my dad wanted to get. I also love the fact you can find almost any game, any sport on TV here. The service was great and the people who dined alongside were nice..   This place is like a hidden gem, check it out."}
{"text":"This is still one of my favorite dives in Charlotte. Such an underrated sports bar. I love to come up here to watch playoff hockey. They have over 100 TVs, a ton of great specials throughout the week, and pretty solid bar food.   My order here is always different depending on my mood. I'm a sucker for any menu that offers fried mushrooms. I love the sweet & spicy wing sauce. The stuffed baked potatoes are great.   There is always something going on here. Cornhole, pool and darts leagues, foosball tournaments. Karaoke on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays. Trivia on Wednesday nights, bingo on Thursdays.   Shelbi and the entire staff do a great job here. You'll see a ton of regulars. Everyone is so nice, so friendly. If you end up on the patio, you'll find yourself in a conversation with strangers. Makes sense, their tag line on the website is \"Where Old Friends Make New Friends.\""}
{"text":"This Place is so great I love atmosphere and when I walk in I get greeted immediately and I like that now on to the food I came here last Thursday night and I ordered the lemon pepper wings and they were to die for they were juicy and crispy and packed with flavor I been in Charlotte for 13 years and I must say this place has the best wings hands down!"}
{"text":"I have stopped in this place a few times for a quick drink or two.  It's a decent place, sports bar feel, very large bar.  It has several pool tables and areas for people to sit.  There are many tvs in different areas of the bar.    The service is good.  The bartenders are friendly and attentive.  They are talkative and willing to make different drinks to your individual liking.  They have daily specials on drinks and shots, which are pretty good and fairly strong.    Overall this is a good place to come, especially if you like sports and pool.  There is plenty of room to spread out, play a good game of pool, listen to music, and watch sports.  There is an outside area that I haven't got to try out due to the cigarette smoking.  Just not my thing."}
{"text":"I wasn't really sure what to give steamers as far as a rating goes. I wasn't in love with it, but I also can't say really anything bad about it either. I really only had two small complaints about the restaurant. Number one, I felt the food was a little expensive for what you got.  All the food was good, just a little pricey in my opinion for standard bar food.  Number two, I felt the crowd was 40 and up. Not necessarily a bad thing just wasn't my cup of tea.  Other than that though, this is a really cool bar. They have a little bit of everything. If you love pool and darts this is your Macha! They have endless dartboards and four or five pool tables throughout the bar. Countless amounts of TVs so it's perfect for game day also."}
{"text":"The ultimate \"hole in the wall\" bar. This place rocks and so does the food! I recommend the fries - always so good."}
{"text":"Well, Steamers is alright. I've been told it's a little bit of a Yesteryears 2.0 (I never got to enjoy the original, but I feel like I would have) and a few of the regulars have made this their new spot - but this will definitely just be a once in a while bar for me.   It's oddly laid out with multiple doorways, breaking it down into a game room (pool tables etc), more of a bar space, and then lots of tables - with 103 TVs lining the ceiling (no I didn't count, our server informed us of this). They even have TVs in the smoking area outside. The whole place was ridiculously clean, I was really quite surprised. They have karaoke on the weekends (why we were there), and although it took them a while to start calling our group's songs, it didn't seem like an unreasonable wait.   Service was pretty good, our server started out a little rough around the edges but by the end of the night I think he warmed up to us. The drinks were maybe slightly more expensive than anticipated (but they did have an okay beer special), but nothing was on the weak side, and he and the rest of the bar staff catered to our odd shot requests.   Other than the location, the fact that I can't wrap my head around the set-up is keeping me from really liking it. I'm sure during the day with different lighting and as more of a restaurant it probably has a completely different feeling, but for a random karaoke night - it's not too bad either (or if you need to watch twenty things at the same time)."}
{"text":"It's a dive bar. You have to know that going in--but it's a really fun dive bar. They have different events throughout the week like trivia and karaoke. They have great drink specials and the food isn't half bad either!   If you're an Eagles fan, this is your bar on game days--but they have like 100 TV's in there so regardless, you can watch whatever team you'd like to route for.   The staff is friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is fun. It's a nice laid-back spot to have a cheap beer and watch some football!"}
