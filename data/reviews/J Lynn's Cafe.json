{"text":"One of those places that you will just start at the top of the menu, and eventually try everything on it. I'm working my way through it, so far nothing has disappointed. Special's keep the menu fresh. Great friendly staff. A little pricy,but worth it due to the freshness and quality of ingredients."}
{"text":"This is a small sandwhich shop on Stuebenville Pike. There are a few tables inside but usually I will get mine to go. 

Most recently I had a club sandwhich on a pretzel bun. OH Man I love pretzel buns. The rest of the sandwhich was pretty good.

They really dont have too many other things than sandwhichs', but the sandwhichs are worth it."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch and had the cheeseburge special with a side of macaroni salad. The burger was freshly made and was very filling. The food is all made to order and fresh daily. They offer delivery, but with a $20 minimum."}
{"text":"Delicious little hole in the wall cafe. The people were nice and they had a good variety of sandwiches. I also had the cherry limeade and it was great."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or to grab a few hoagies to take home. Everything is fresh and they make some good smoothies. My wife is pregnant and the fresh food here is a regular favorite for both of us. Great Small business with friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Fantastic omelets and breakfast sandwiches.
The Bacon Western Omelet was one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of JLynn's nice staff and darn good food.  They are very flexible in making things to order and have some great treats like homemade pickles, cookies and fresh beets which I didn't even know I liked until trying them there.  I found it when looking for restaurants around my old office and just keep going back."}
{"text":"My physical Therapist recommended J Lynns Café for lunch today and I have often drove past when I worked Robinson all the time but never stopped.  I am glad I did today.  The café is quite charming.  There are plenty of seating available and I didn't wait long for my sandwich or smoothie.   I waited maybe 5 minutes.. not bad. Mango smoothie was tasty and oh so smooth.  The BBQ Steak and Bacon Pretzel Melt was pretty Awesome.  I normally wouldn't put bbq sauce on my steak but it gave the sandwich a little zing to it. The steak..  it wasn't like \"steak em\" meat.. it was angus sliced steak and the bacon was crispy (ahh bacon). 

Just the sandwich was $7.99 but it was worth it.  I don't mind paying for a sandwich if it's a good..and this was a \"decent\" sandwich. There is a nice variety on the menu.  I am a sandwich lover so its nice to have options.. wraps, hoagies, pretzel bun etc. The service was very friendly and the establishment was clean.  Delivery ($20.00 min.) and Catering available.  Only open until 4:00 M-F -  Saturday open from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM
I am excited to go back soon.  

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Don't expect their drivers to be on time! Waited 90 minutes for a lunch order that they said would take 30 and still no sign of them. Called twice and received little attempt to retain us as a future customer. Will be skipping J-Lynn's in the future!"}
{"text":"Came in to grab a quick lunch.

Had the chicken, walnut and apple salad sandwich served on multi-grain bread.

Very tasty and obviously homemade. 

Staff was friendly and prices were reasonable. Nice local place."}
{"text":"Got introduced to JLynn's through their catering, which was good, but their sandwiches available at the shop are even better!  The pretzel buns are delicious and the sandwiches are huge. Would get 5 stars if based on taste alone but 8 bucks for just a sandwich is a bit steep for everyday eating."}
{"text":"Good little place to eat lunch. I had the daily special and it was good for under $10. When i went in few people were there and it took a good bit of time from them to cook our food so if its a line to eat, might be really slow. also the dinning room is a bit smoky from the oven.

getting in and out of the parking lot is kinda tricky if theirs traffic."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised upon walking into the cafe.  Very clean and cute decor accompanied with friendly staff. Fresh ingredients & classic made to order deli options. I got the grilled Rachael ($7.99)  & buffalo chicken sandwich ($8.99). You pay for sri ks and sides separately. My Rachael had two slices of turkey less than 2oz of meat, this was disappointing. The Buffalo chicken wasn't mixed and just had bufflao sauce lightly on top along with ranch. Overall everything tasted okay but we were left hungry and wanting more flavor. After spending $20 on only two sandwiches that were just okay, I do not think I will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area looking at houses, and decided to stop for a quick breakfast bite before meeting with our realtor. We told them we had 15 minutes, and they were more then happy to accommodate us. Not only did we immediately feel welcome, the food was simple but so delicious! We both ordered the breakfast panini and hot cocoa and couldn't have been more pleased. We will definitely go back when we have more time to try more menu items and people-watch!"}
