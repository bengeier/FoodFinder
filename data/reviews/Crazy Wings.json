{"text":"I had high hopes for Crazy Wings, it looks like fun and the decor is pretty neat when you walk in! I've given it 3 tries, though - and I don't think I'll be back.  Pros- -Decent menu selection.. Decent beer selection -Food was pretty good, when we got it.  Cons- -Too loud to have a decent conversation in the evening -You have to walk through a major cloud of cigarette smoke to get in the door.  I'm not sure how legal it is to have smoking that close to the entrance in the city of Toronto... -Service is pretty appalling.  It's one of those places that gets you seated and served ok, but when you want to leave, getting the bill and then getting them to come back to run your card is next to impossible. -I'm not a wing eater, but I hear from others that the sauce selection is pretty abysmal for a place that has \"wings\" in the name.  Like I said, I gave it a fair shot, and I won't be heading back.  There are too many other options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Okay. Nothing special and or \"wow\". Food is cheap and the portions are not that big. Service was okay. Lots of wing places in the area with better wings"}
{"text":"Been there with friends on a Thursday night. The staff is friendly and efficient. We ordered some pitchers and appetizers. In general the quality was good and really worth the price.  Crazy wings is very accessible from the Finch subway stations, it's just across the street."}
{"text":"3.5*   My friends and I love coming here for wings, fries and drinks as there prices are pretty reasonable and the food is great. However, our most recent experience here was a little disappointing as both the quantity and quality of food has gone down. We always order several flavours of 2lb wings with fries and the wing were tiny and had little to no meat on it. They was also only a couple pieces of fries as well. The drinks were still alright, they added more drinks options to the menu and we decided to try the lime coronarita which was delicious.   Service is not the best, but no service issues so no complaints. They also offer complimentary peanuts and pretzels which you can ask for refill. I hope they do make changes to their foods, so we don't need to cross this place off our regular hangout list!"}
{"text":"Great place. Atmosphere and service is awesome. And the food is good. Reasonable drink prices"}
{"text":"Good place to just chill and they really have great deals everyday.  Servers are really friendly."}
{"text":"i come here often to drink bc of its convenient location (right on yonge &finch) their food us okay like other pubs but never try their seafood items bc everytime i get something w seafood, i feel sick and it actually tastes bit weird (watery and too soft). during summer having some drink at terrace is really nice but theres too much pollutions ( pigeons+their drippings+feather and car)"}
{"text":"Just went yesterday for take out and really enjoyed the noddle dish with chicken pieces. Going back today to try something else. Very friendly and good service from the gentleman who greated and served me."}
{"text":"After recently moving to the Toronto area I was dying to see what was around my location!   I would frequently see this restaurant with attractive lighting standing out on the corner of yonge and finch! oh and it had the word \"wings\" in it!!! I love wings!!! So I had to try it!  I came here on a Wednesday night, as soon as I entered I noticed this wasn't the typical \"beer and wings\" sports bar! It's actually quite dark and mellow almost romantic...good thing I had a date :)  The sever greeted us fast but they didn't seem very attentive, one seemed more focused on the basketball game in the big screen than the customers. Anyways I of course ordered my wings (honey BBQ) which were absolutely delicious! Take it from a wings guy when I say they are finger licking good! My date ordered a crazy burger! Which I am assuming is their signature burger, she really like it, she was actually kinda surprised because she didn't expect such a juicy burger!  Both orders came with crispy waffle fries and dip. I will definitely be visiting this place again soon and maybe try some of their daily specials which looked interesting!  Might even become a regular if they're lucky :)"}
{"text":"Those damn smug patrons ignoring all passer bys as they sit in Yonge & Finch's only patio. Well, minus the Starbucks across the street, but it's a Starbucks..so it doesn't count. Well..if they think they can lure me into their establishment with some fancy woodwork...they're right.  Table for two please!  The patio was tempting, but the pollution was enough to drive me inside. I know the name should have been revealing enough, but it didn't occur to me that this was a sports bar. Korean sports bar..now that's just unusual.  The place was beaming with Asian patrons, I was dying to find out what the buzz was about.   The décor was lively. The huge collection of colourful bottles at the south end of the restaurant stood conspicuously lit, making the place seem more vibrant. It was like an enormous alcohol rainbow. Mmmm...alcohol rainbowww.. Unfortunately, the drinks on the menu doesn't come close to the selections on the wall. A huge toy sized aeroplane hung above me from the ceiling, not sure how that fits in.  I see a lot of Women I'd see in the Scarborough area here, but only this environment was friendly. The wait staff spoke English without any difficulty, and the fusion of Eastern cuisine with Western décor meddled with much civility.    The menu was interesting. I found many selections one would find in a place like St. Louis..only this place added a Korean twist to the food. There are a lot more choices with seafood, mainly comprised of squid and mussels. Instead of fries, you can get the fried rice. The prices were only slightly highly than what you would find at a normal sports bar.   I ordered the ribs and wings with fries. My friend ordered a half pound of wings. I expected to get messy, but the ribs literally slipped right off the bone with a few pokes of the fork. I didn't get any sauce on my fingers! The chicken wings that came with it wasn't anything special. The fries were honeycomb shaped.  I was content, good place to chill. The seating in here were half booths, half tables. I felt like I could approach the people in here. But really I can't. Because it's Asian.  All was well, until I decided to wash my hands in the washroom. FILTHY! It was a disaster! At a complete contrast to the front of house. I've been to better kept facilities in Chinatown! It reeked of spunk, toilet paper all over the floor, a cesspool for bacteria and germs. Suddenly my opinion about the place changed. What the hell is with the aeroplane above me? Why do they have all the bottles when they don't serve any of them? Why are there Scarborough looking people in North York? Dammit!  I fail to see how the wings here were crazy at all.  Normal...utterly sane wings!"}
{"text":"This place has terrible customer service, I live nearby and have dined in restaurant twice and ordered take out four or five times. The food here is standard fare but the crazy burger is quite good. The establishment is usually being run by young people that don't really care much about the job let alone customer service. They have consistently been less then friendly, messed up my orders, gave my take out order to someone else and even ran out of the food I ordered but waited for me to come pick it up to tell me and then proceeded to act like I was ridiculous for being upset and wanting a full refund. You may get lucky and have a few good trips here but I firmly believe it will only be a matter of time till something goes sour!"}
{"text":"Service tended to be a bit slow as a friend and I waited at least 20 minutes for our food. I also wish the seats at the booths would have some sort of cushion to them instead of hitting your a** on a hard piece of wood right when you sit down - and yeah that line that did sound a bit wrong lol but nonetheless the wings were alright and the fries (cross-cut) were different than most places I go to grab wings so that was interesting. Other than that the server gave us the wrong bill at the end and none of the other servers paid attention to other people at their tables so it was obvious that customer \"service\" was not a paramount enforcement. All in all I would come here again for another fry fix but I'd still go to wild wing for their variety in flavours unlike here."}
{"text":"Good stop for a late night snack and some drinks, but then I'd rather go across the street to wild wings to be honest."}
{"text":"Finally an asian place that both has beer and wings! Yeah, there are many places that serve this kind of food but this place is particularly run by Asians.  Location wise, it is right on the corner of Yonge and Finch which I found this place after not wanting to wait in the most longest line for my bus EVER. I mean this FREAKING line was so Long.   Regardless, the place wasn't that empty seeing that its a Tuesday night and I was immediately seated for one person. The vibe of this place was comfy but they play such GOD awful music here that having more than a couple of beers here would be much of a better place.  Luckily, I was sat in front of a TV that was at first showing TOO much commercials and not enough sports. The place itself has around 5 to 6 TVs that showed either soccer, WWE and other shows that I did not watch.   The pricing is standard for bars specifically chained and generic sports bar that overprices everything. However they have specials including lunch, happy hour and different specials every day. And so I ordered the 1b sweet BBQ wings that seems to be half the price according to the special featured.   I ordered a pint well two pints of Stella for myself (Pint of Stella costs 6.95 or so) and noticed some bits of debris floating at the bottom of the beer. I did not really taste the difference due to the fact of that but it was somewhat disturbing.   The order of wings came by and I was surprised that the fries were wafflish kind of fries and it was cheesy and delicious. It really complimented the sauce. The wings itself was saucy and juicy but I find that half of the wings looked weird. I mean, I never had a wing that had a thing sticking out that I wasn't able to eat it.   The service itself consists of two female waiters and a decent response time when I flag them down. The place wasn't that full but there were some instances that it was somewhat slow.   My total bill was $35.10 and typically this amount of Stellas, Jamesons and wings and waffle fries is a reasonable price that is of a sports bar."}
{"text":"I had their avocado supreme salad and it was delicious! This is not my first time and I will continue to come here. Atmosphere is casual and relaxing with friendly waiters. I love the mixed retro feel to the decor and the food taste good too. I guess the only downfall is that they have several flies flying around but other than that my experience here has been good overall."}
{"text":"I love how convenient this location is; right at the corner of yonge and Finch. They always have daily specials, with cheap shots on Friday and Saturday. It is a good place to watch the game but it can get quite loud.   I wasn't too impressed with the calamari because it was a pretty much 70% chips and very little calamari. Their specialty fries are really good though, so it is definitely a safe pick.  They don't have wifi :(( common crazy wings, get it together!! I don't have the heart to give them less than 4 stars though because service and food really isn't bad at all! Please get wifi so I can check in on yelp...thanks  :'("}
{"text":"More often than not, I've come for lunch, for drinks after work and for dinner.  THeir burgers are great, the portion is huge, it tastes great.  Love their crispy onion burger!  Their crazy burger is good too.  And they come w/ a good-sized side of spicy tracks/criss-cross fries.    I've also tried their wings (blue cheese buffalo, hot honey) and it's alright, not as good as other Wing staples such as Wild Wing or St. Louis, but it's definitely not the worst...so I don't mind it at all actually.  They got chicken + fries, which is always a hit with a group for sharing.  They got some specials too.  Friday/Sat  -half price shots ($2.99)  During lunch, they have lunch combos which range from $8 - 12, for teriyaki bento boxes or 1lb wings + fries.  Will mostly be coming back here and recommend it for friendly gatherings! If you go after work for drinks, sometimes, they give you fries or heated chips + dip on the house, which is a great plus!"}
{"text":"Crazy Wings has some killer specials on every night of the week.  I came here on a Wednesday and they had a chicken fingers special with fries for super cheap and the portions were pretty massive.  I have come here on a few ocassions and the service has been what you normally expect from a busy resto-bar.  The servers are hit or miss and just make sure you order your drinks two at a time depending who you get. Their wings are decent and more like a semi insane instead of the super crazy they are going for.  This place is great for a quick drink on their large patio in the summertime and for some weird reason if you need to exchange some currency there is a window right beside the entrance where you can do that."}
{"text":"Daily specials here are great, which makes it a great place to chill if you just wanna drink."}
{"text":"I usually come here with my friends for the half priced \"crazy\" wings and a pitcher. They taste great and different than what you find at the usual bars. Other than their crazy wings I have also tried their nachos chicken which is a huge plate and tastes great too. Friendly service and free WiFi."}
{"text":"went there a couple of times now. Service is decent, food is just your average sports bar ,  cocktails and mixed drinks are a bit to sweet for my taste.   I don't suggest you go there early due to lack of servers from my experience and from what friends have told me as well. You should probably go on tuesdays as i really do enjoy their tuesday special of wings.  Overall good to go with small groups of friends as it isn't crazy spacious, everything is decent nothing crazy great about it and nothing terrible about the place either!"}
{"text":"I went on Tuesday with a couple friends. The special for the day was half price wings with a purchase of a drink. We arrived minutes after they opened so there was only one server.   We all ordered wings and alcoholic beverages. Our wings came before our drinks and the wings were lukewarm. We didn't get our drinks until about 20mins after our wings arrived. Understandable since there was only one server and he doubled as the bartender. I go to Crazy Wings often but never when they just open for the day, so I feel like service would be better if you go after 6pm.  Overall it's a good place to eat and drink, they have daily specials that are pretty good. But I'd definitely recommend going later toward the evening."}
{"text":"WTF!!! is what I have say. I came here with my girl on a Saturday mainly for the drink attraction. $3 shots I mean why not? NOT! Tryna get crunk? Go some where else. This was an utter disappointment. I had 4 shots of crown and a 2 shots of tequila. My gf had the same amount of shots but more tequila. I'm pretty sure they water that shit down cuz I was not drunk at all let alone buzzed. I'm considered a lightweight from where I'm from I break out in the \"Asian glow\" after about 2-3 shots. I haven't drank in a while before coming here so I expected to get something! I ended with a half assed buzz looking like a normal person by the end! Shit is whack breh! After that many shots I should be able to taste alcohol in my breath but nope nothing. I get more of a buzz from a beer at home.  Same thing happened with my gf. At the end of our endeavor my gf ordered a coronarita. Tasted like there was almost no tequila in it. She killed the whole thing by herself but still nothing!!! Probably never coming back here. I feel so jipped, giving to charity is less of scam than this! Some shady bizzness happenin here. If I could I'd give no stars cuz I'm FUCKIN PISSED!! Wtf yall tryna pull here man!!"}
{"text":"Crazy Wings was our Lunch destination the Monday following Boxing Day.  We were the first and pretty much the only ones in this Modern Pub that does a Fusion Menu of Korean + Wings.  The place is meant for the \"Suits\" to chillax after finishing their day of more chillaxing, therefore the Beer Bottle Display and the LCDs reflecting the mood.  It was slightly after noon hour and we went in while their Kitchen started up.  Must have been a CRAZY time the previous night as even some of the Beer on Tap was depleted.  Friendly Korean Waitresses told us Fried Rice was not ready so substituted Steam Rice instead.  My Crew consisted of the following Tolerances(Out of 5 Chili):  (A)ngel Spice (0 Chili) + (B)aby Spice (1 Chili) + (J)alapeño Spice (5 Chili)  L1 Chicken Wing($6.95 Monday Lunch Special)  -  Values are good IMO considering this came with 6 Wings(Approx 6 Flavour Choices) + Fries or Fried Rice + Side Salad + Flavoured Ice Tea.  *** I learn the lesson that Mondays is THE day to be \"Sick\" from work.  Lightly battered Wings have just enough batter to become crispy while allowing the sauce to adhere.  The sauce was not overly coated but the selection is restricted for a place that notes \"Wings\" in their Business Name.  I'm surprised that in this neighbourhood, they don't serve an insane 5 out of 5 Spicy Wing Sauce.  I find even the Hot & Sweet was barely 1-Chili worthy.  They did redeem by serving Waffle Fries!  That is a bonus because I ate bagloads in my University days when I discovered them at the Grocer Freezer.  Fiery Chicken with Rice Cake ($15.95)  -  I guess is a version of Dak Galbi because of it's simplified ingredients of Gochujang, Chicken Cubes and Rice Cake.  Yes, both the Chicken and Rice Cake were slightly overdone just slightly but the reasoning is that it was served on a Cast Iron Plate.  Kind of pricey considering it's the price of 2 Soon Tofus which is nearby the area but in the Pub environment I guess it is A-OK."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place doesn't have better reviews - I love coming here! They have a different evening special every day of the week, but my favourite specials are on Mondays and Tuesdays where wings are half off with the purchase of a drink. Prices have gone up a few dollars in the past year, but $10 for a pound of wings (and fries) and a can of pop is still pretty good to me! I love this place so much, I make sure to come here every few weeks.  This restaurant is right by Yonge and Finch, so parking is a pain. You can test your luck and park in the Shoppers lot behind the restaurant (meant for Shoppers customers only) which give you an hour of free parking. Careful - only certain spots are free and they will be labelled with a sign that says reserved for Shoppers customers. Or you can pay for parking in that same lot or on the street. This is a fairly small restaurant - 10 or so tables inside and a small patio, but I've never seen it super busy. There are TVs inside so you can watch the game!  It used to cost $7.50 for a can of pop ($2) and a pound of wings ($10.99 then half off), but the past few times I went it cost about $10 per person (I think pop went up to $2.50 and wings went up to $15/pound). They have about 20 options for flavours and each pound comes with the most amazing waffle fries I've ever tasted (plus dip and veggies). Portions are generous and service is always fast and friendly!  TIP: if you're in a party of 2 and want to get the wings special but don't want to buy 2 cans of pop, you can make 1 order of 2 pounds of wings (you can order 2 different flavours) so you only have to buy 1 can of pop."}
{"text":"We got there and chose our seats. Ofc on one of the hotter days, they choose to not have A/C on so that really sucked. Gave us the menus, asked what we wanted we asked for water. Didn't get it until way later. We asked if we could get half price on the nachos (since it was a daily special) since we were ordering two entrees but aren't drinkers and waiter told us no. So we placed our orders in, service took foreverrrrrrr. We waited so long for our food. It was pretty ridiculous. I ordered honey and spicy boneless wings and the first batch was pretty inedible. WAY too spicy. Next batch was ok but still not any better but I tried to change the flavour before this batch the waiter said it was okay but instead brought back another honey and spicy with less spicy...yeah right. It was sooo saucy and still too spicy. We struggled eating it. I just gave up on trying. The only thing I like was the fries. That was it. Next time definitely going to St. Louis instead."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here yesterday after a stressful day of work, and gosh darn it, we needed a drink.   This is how it happened \"Anastasiya, I'm at Bayview. Come meet me at puck and wing now for beer. K.\"  Followed by \" Actually, lets do Crazy. They have a huge patio and Im in the mood to smoke my lungs out\"  So it happened, we ended up here.  We started off by ordering a pitcher of Keiths (16.99) which was nice, cold Keiths. You can't really go wrong here.  One pitcher down, and I was starting to get hungry.  I took a look at the menu, and I couldn't decide between the snack basket, which had every type of deep fried starch imaginable in it, or the 1lb wings + fries.  I ended up going with the wings, because I didn't want a deep fried heart attack just yet.  I ordered the Oriental BBQ, with the waffle fries.  Might I add though, the service was slow. One person running the patio, and the patio was packed. No tables. Next to us, there were 4 people sitting at a two people table. There wasn't a seat to be had. Inside, there was only 1 table full. Oh, summer.  Anyways, after I flagged her down 2454523426352452 times, she took my order and brought us another pitcher of Canadian (15.49)  I was half in the bag by the time the wings came, so I was ready to nom.  There were approx 9-10 wings, a huge serving of waffle fries, and some celery sticks and a really cool dill-ish dipping sauce.  The wings were okay, the size were not the best, and the flavour I got had a weird...fishy aftertaste.   The fries was the bomb diggity. Like for real real. They were sexy.  The dip was odd at first, but then I learnt to love it.  I'd come back here just because its right next door to my friends place."}
{"text":"Right on the corner of yonge and finch lies this (somewhat-of-a) beauty. It's literally a korean-ized wing place. They have specials everyday, which is pretty good! I know the monday and tuesday one only - half price wings baby!  Let's talk about their food first.  To be honest, their wings are not that great.. I've had better ones BY FAR. They're small-average in size and the dressing is mediocre. Now I must say the BEST things here are the 'crazy fries' aka WAFFLE FRIES, MOTHERFUCKER. Omg! Honestly, the fry quality is not that great but the fact that it's a waffle fry ... ermeeehgerrrd. Soooo good.  Their drinks are ok.. nothing special, if anything they're a bit overpriced. Do not get their salads .. they sound super yummy on the menu, but when they come, they're bland as fuck. I tried to finish the whole thing but I couldn't even get through half of it successfully. The chicken on the mandarin chicken salad literally reminded me of the inside of those costco roasted chickens - did they just buy them wholesale and scrape off inner pieces of bland, dry meat?? ..  The service is not bad, the waitresses/waiters are attentive (most of the time) and they get their shit done, even if it's not done with a smile.  The washroom is gross and creepy.. not sure about the male, but the female one is dimmed and one of them was broken and flooded with some sort of chunky puke that the workers definitely slacked on cleaning up. Loss of appetite much?  I come here maybe once in a few months and already that's a bit much for me."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu was just way below par, particularly the wings. Service is a joke (smile, people!) and beer way overpriced. Terrible experience overall, too bad as the location is just about perfect to make it a regular hangout. Stay away!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to wing places on Monday and Tuesday for wing night special. Wings come with waffle fries. Friendly staff and quick service. One critique is that every time if I decide to order the same flavor of wings, each visit the sauce is either less spicy, more spicy or not enough sauce. Would like it more if the sauce flavor was more consistent and saucy."}
{"text":"My friend and I, as per usual, went here for a drink around 9pm on a Wednesday.  Location is pretty good, especially since I live so close. It's right on the corner of Yonge and Finch next to my favorite Korean restaurant (Nak Won woot woot!).   It was quite busy for a weeknight, there were very few spaces left on the patio. The patio is big but it faces Yonge st so the noise and pollution level is a little high for my liking. You can smoke on the patio though, which is a nice convenience for those of you who enjoy a smoky environment.  Inside is dimmed lighting and LOUD music. Too loud for my taste, playing mostly top 40. There are two TV's, maybe 3? If you just can't live without seeing that golf game this will be convenient.  We ordered a pitcher of Keith's for 16.99 and a pound of wings with waffle fries. THE FRIES ARE GREAT, crispy and delish as ever. The wings were something along the lines of spicy-ish Thai, with a fishy aftertaste (as per Abbas). I didn't like them - too dry and not saucy enough for me at all.   The service was slow, the server didn't seem to look in our direction at all - just kind of strolled by taking one order at a time.  All in all, if you want to grab a beer and hang out on a patio while the summer is still here, this place will do. They had a lot more on the menu aside from wings so I would recommend something other than wings!  Xoxo, foodie."}
{"text":"Nice place its a Korean bar lots of korean come here. My favorite of the place is Sunday chicken Nacho's special they taste amazing my favorite of all. The wings are not the best they are ok but I had better. I really like the place and the patio. However washroom is bad it need to be renovated 4 sure it is old and rusty. And I hate how they leave the beer cags outside beside the customers it will be nice if they can hide it. Finally they had the wine sujo for short time and it was amazing they should bring it back that was one of my favorite drink of all times and it will be great if they can bring it back."}
{"text":"I wish I cld give this place 6 stars! The food was awesome (i had the chicken tenders with dill dip as it was their special of the day), but the customer service I received was what really made this such a great experience.  The server made sure I had the hockey game on tv that I wanted to watch, and the prime reason for my visit, and then suggested the best seat for me to watch, cut the music and put the games volume on so it felt like my living room.  Then after seeing that my laptop was short on battery, helped me recharge it while letting me watch the game.  He never let my drink dip below 30% without asking if I'd like another! The food came out quickly and was delicious!! I will definitely be back, and suggest you try this place if you havent already!!"}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had!! Don't go here. Last Friday after a long day of work me and a good friend decides to go for a beer and some food. I sat down waited for 10 min to be served, slow service no big deal right. Here is where it starts I ordered a pitcher of Rickard's red she come back 5 min later and says we are out of Rickard's red, so I said jokingly: you guys are out of my favourite beer you guys should give me a discount. So I ordered a chicken katsu don and a pitcher MGD instead. She comes back a second time and says we are out of chicken too. At this point I am starving, disappointed and haven't had my beer either, so I said: honestly this is really bad you guy had nothing I order, you guys should really give me a discount at this point. Here is the kicker the waitress said: sorry we can't do that but what I can do is i can cancel your order and you can leave. 0.0 She didn't explain or anything and just went inside. wow not only did you not tell the customer what stock you are out of before they order now she is just plain rude. So I want in to talk to the manager, i spoke with an older couple first that looked like the owners, they talked in Korean with the waitress for 5 min to find out what's going, and then decided to pretend the waitress is the manager and just flat out refuse to serve me. Honestly if she is really the manager no wonder their service is so slow and crappy. How do you run out of chicken and beer for a wings restaurant, this is laughable. Not to mention this is not the first time I've been here, I was just there with a friend 2 weeks ago when we spent about $100 for dinner, and they had no problem with giving us free food then, but even then the portions weren't that great. This is just not taking responsibility for not doing their job. Never in my life have I been treated so poorly in a restaurant. Don't go here !"}
{"text":"Mondays are half price wings (with the purchase of a drink). Ordered Hot Caesar and a pint of Belgian Moon.  The wings came with a small bunch of waffle fries. The taste was alright, saucy and spicy. I wish it came with a bit more fries though. I unfortunately forgot to take a pic.  It has a small patio right on the corner of Yonge and Finch so it's a nice place to sit with friends."}
{"text":"Ohh my waffle fries...   I came on a Friday night and my only regret was not trying this place earlier! $3 shots on Friday? Yes please!!   My friends and I were seated right away, and the first thing I noticed about the place was how it's actually pretty small. It looks big on the outside because of the patio I think but no big deal because it didn't feel like a squeeze. Wouldn't really suggest it for a big group though. The dim lighting and bench seating make it interesting.   The service was decent, no complaints there. The food was great. I always say that there are no fries and dip better than the St. Louis fries + creamy fill but the waffle fries + creamy dill at Crazy Wings may just be my new fave.   Price point is reasonable (hello $3 shots!!). I got a side of waffle fries + dip for $7 and it was enough for me.   TDLR: highly recommend, great Friday night hang out spot and reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Awesome poutine and great place to grab a place for drinks, only complaint I have about this place is that I wish they had more comfortable seating otherwise I'd come back, lots of drinks and food items on the menu"}
{"text":"We stopped at this place last Saturday for a quick drink & finger foods in Midtown. My friend ordered the chicken wings and I ordered the onion rings. The food was okay and the atmosphere decent."}
{"text":"If I was to write a review based on the first time I came here, it would be a 4 star. The food was cheap, it had a diverse menu and the food was tasty. However, as I visit this place several more times, I started to see some flaws. The service is not the best. One time I had to wait for my food because they just forgot to bring it to my table (my friend was almost done my meal when I began mine). If you want to get the bill, you have to wait forever. The food was still okay but just not as amazing as the first time. It's definitely a good cheap place to eat if you're around the area, but no need to make a trip here to try it out."}
{"text":"This has always been my go-to place; Korean bar, but not super loud so you can still have a nice conversation with your friends. They have so many other good selection other than wings as well. I especially like their daily specials, i.e. shots night on Friday/Saturdays. I've always brought my friends over here in the past 3 years."}
{"text":"Very good wings and the waitress Sandra was very welcoming and quick with the food and drink."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a chill night out with friends. Staff is good and efficient, prices are average but they have daily specials. On Fri and sat its their shot days so it's $3 for a rail shot. On tap is your regular mainstream beers & since this is at yonge/finch they of course have your sojus and makgeuli.   Food is good, I've had their nachos, teriyaki sandwich, bulgogi burger and boneless wings. I would highly recommend the bulgogi burger with their crazy fries (waffle fries). You also get free peanuts/pretzels/spicy sweet seaweed with your visit there."}
{"text":"This review is probably skewed because I went on a Tuesday and Tuesday is half price wing night. Also, chicken and beer is a hard thing to screw up. With that said, I had good service and decent food.   Since it was half priced we obviously ordered far too many wings. The good news is, we tried a lot of flavours. To be honest the sauces weren't outstanding but the honest garlic is good enough.  Ambience. Decent and a little loud. But I have no problems with a little loud"}
{"text":"Decent wings at good price on monday and tuesday. I personally like teriyaki, hot and sweet, honey garlic.  I tried their ribs, was ok but wont get it again. Their poutines are great too at good portion."}
{"text":"Went here to have lunch with a friend during the work week. This location has been many different restaurants in the past. Some of them ok, some of them downright yucky. But Crazy Wings is good, decent food for reasonable prices.  I had the Tofu Teriyaki lunch & my friend had the Salmon Teriyaki lunch. At 6.99 & 8.99 the prices are standard for lunch. If I were to nitpick I wish  they included just a couple more cubes of tofu in the lunch order. Music in this place was an improvement to the previous establishment which only played Korean pop songs. Sorry, for a non-Korean I find that music annoyingly whiney & repetitive. The decor hasn't changed much inside except for those lit bottles on the wall. Outside tho, they built a nice patio. The waiter did a good job, except he got a little confused with the cutlery, which made us laugh. :-) I got two forks & my friend only got 1 knife. So I gave her my second fork & she gave me her knife."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and food, everything was great, service isn't the best. They do forget about you at times and forget what to get you. The bar looks great, seats are very spacious but the tables were not clean and were sticky. Would go back but I already know what to expect"}
{"text":"So, after passing by this place a million times, I've finally decided to settle my curiosity. I came here on a Tuesday with one of my girl friends and it was alright... So, let me tell you why.  Right off the bat, service was mediocre. Probably because they're understaffed? Our server came over after we were seated momentarily to take our order however, we were undecided and needed a few more minutes. Finally, when we have made up our minds, we had to constantly try to get her attention.   I ordered the Lime Coronarita while my girl friend ordered the Mango Coronarita and Cajun Chicken Wings. The drinks were 9 bucks and the chicken wings were half price since it was a Tuesday. I don't normally drink cocktails but the Lime Coronarita was one of their go-tos so, I've decided to try it. It tastes like its name, not too sour or too sweet. A perfect balance between the two and it actually gave me a bit of a buzz going on, haha. The wings were mediocre, I've had better however, the fries were yummy! They're not your regular french fries, they are miniature waffle fries!  Once our bellies were full, we tried get our server's attention for our bill. Again, it took quite a long time for us to get her attention. Instead, we just asked another server for our bill and quickly got out of there.  Would I come here again? Probably, if I'm craving for another Lime Coronarita."}
{"text":"its difinitely a drinking environment. you walk in and all you see is beer bottles and beer cans for decorations. Although it does have a classy look to the place if that makes any sense. The 3Lb wing and pitcher of beer special for $30 is very nice! im not sure if it is just for weekdays or everyday.  i really liked the creamy dill sauce for the wings although im not a huge fan of wings..the wing sizes are fairly decent not too small but not big a$$ the selection of flavours are limited...southwest corner of yonge and finch lots of parking in the back or street. it's worth checking out"}
{"text":"Crazy Wings located in North Korean Town right across from Finch Subway Station.   Being in a Korean area, the menu at Crazy Wings does have a menu that reflect this.. Chicken Wings, Ribs and Korean Style Chicken.   Monday to Friday Lunch Specials are offered here which is different everyday with drinks. Being here on Monday they have Wing Combo ($6.95) comes with 6 wings, salad, choice of fried rice or fries.   Flavours here are more limited. there are 6 different flavours. We ended up trying Original, BBQ, Hot and Sweet and Honey Garlic.   The chicken wings here are quite moist and tasty... one of the better ones I have lately. For the sauce I like Hot and Sweet... and there is a huge bottle of Tabasco if you really want to spice it up!!   Fiery Chicken with Rice Cake ($15.95)  3 chili spiciness... Korean style spiced with traditional Korean chili sauce. The chicken is BBQ first then stired fried in hot sauce with rice cakes served on a hot plate. I always love chewy and soft rice cake... the chicken though is a little dry.....   The deco here is clean and neat. Service is A-OK... Crazy Wings is not really a sport bar as there is only a small TV or 2 and I don't think sport fans will be happy watching a game here!!"}
{"text":"Not too crazy about crazy wings. Paid parking in the back wasn't an issue but the wings were what I found as a bit small compared to other places. Different sauces were available but the Korean BBQ sauce for wings tastes just like honey garlic. In contrast drink specials are great here as you can get shots on thu and fri for $2.99 and $3.99 on all other nights. They have unique drinks here like a drink that has cotton candy in it which was very interesting. You can also get mango Mexican Bulldogs for about $11. Drinks were the main attraction here. I'm almost tempted to say they should just rename the place to crazy cocktails and sell wings on the side. Because you should really only be there for the drinks!"}
{"text":"It's my first time to face this weird thing. My friend came from USA and traveling to here. Both of us went there to watch soccer since this store is a pub. When we try to order the alcohol drinks, my friend showed the US government issued driver license to the waiter, however it was rejected by the waiter as he insisted that only Canadian ID worked for the alcohol drinks. Then we only can order soft drinks. However, 30 minutes later, the waiter came again with rude attitude to forced us to leave because we didn't order any food or alcohol. I totally didn't understand! My friend already 22 yrs old, he uses his USA ID to buy cigarettes and alcohol in Toronto many times. Besides, how come if you don't allow us to purchase the beers then complain that we just sit there and did't buy anything. Come on, it's a pub, I have right to sit there for drink. Definitely, it's the worst restaurant that I met!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to grab some greasy hangover food after a birthday party the night before. We ended up and Crazy Wings.  My view on this restaurant is in the same line as a jacks but a little more basic. When we walked in, the place was practically empty except for one couple just ordering drinks. We took forever to decided on what we wanted. I chose the boneless chicken wings in honey garlic sauce. It was nice to see this meal didn't come with regular fries. They were lattas fries. Nice unique twist and will probably keep me going back. Well the place practically a hop skip and a jump away from my place.  Like I said earlier this place is in need of a face lift. My friend (who was a male) said the washrooms were the nastiest things he has ever seen! From hearing the I was even scared to take a look.   The service was great the waiter was patient while we took our time to order. Not sure if it's because we were the only ones but all in all.  I will return when I'm in the mood for greasy food :D"}
{"text":"Crazy Wings is located around the busy Korean intersection of Yonge and Finch. The decor inside of Crazy Wings has a very modern feel to it with a number of flat screen TVs playing many different games that was broadcasted. We decided to opt for the lunch specials that run from Monday to Sunday except on holidays. We got 4 L1's which were 6 wings with the choice of fries or fried rice and a side garden salad. Each lunch special also came with the choice of a flavoured iced tea (green apple, lemon and mango), coffee or hot tea. We also ordered a Fiery Chicken to be shared upon the group.  We got the drinks 5 mins from when we ordered and the main dishes in about 10 mins. We had ordered a variety of wings to taste and compare. We got an order of Honey Garlic, Hot and Sweet, Original, and BBQ. The wings appeared to be very lightly battered with each flavour's sauce glossed on top. The wings were average to smaller in size than normal. From my perspective, the best tasting wing flavours were Original, BBQ followed by a tie for 3rd, Hot and Sweet and Honey Garlic. The fries appeared to be the McCain potato web/spiral type and the wavy type potato wedge fries. The Fiery Chicken was spicy with a bed of rice cakes on the hot dish. They were alright in nature with a strong spiciness to them. So if you can't take a relatively higher level of spiciness, then I would avoid this item.  Overall, I'm mixed on Crazy Wings. With a name like Crazy Wings, I was hoping for something 'crazy' about them. But I didn't find anything spectacular or special about them. I actually found them to be a relatively average asian type of chicken wings. Some wings were even a little dry in the middle, so with the amount of variety around Yonge and Finch, I would pass on this restaurant. Lunch special makes it somewhat of a deal around the area, but nothing 'CRAZY' here."}
{"text":"Their Korean wing flavors are decent. Food quality and portions sizes aren't exceptional, but it's completely fine for bar food."}
