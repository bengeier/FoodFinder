{"text":"Asked for one type of taco and they brought out another kind. I didn't want to argue. Will not go back to this place. PS health grade 93.5"}
{"text":"Yum!! Other positive reviewers have it covered.  Delicious fresh ingredients. Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Nothing spectacular. The containers they brought to the table were a bit dirty. The rice and beans  tasted like they were not fresh. My husband ordered carne Asada and he said the meat was terrible. We went here because the reviews looked awesome, but were highly disappointed. Oh, and to top it off the Diet Coke cans (because they do not have fountain drinks) were out of date. We will not go back."}
{"text":"We went last night for the first time and were fairly impressed.  We had cheese dip (yum!) and then tacos.  I tried the chicken and the steak and my husband had steak, al pastor, and chorizo.  We both were impressed with the food and can't wait to go back to try something else."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town. Period. This little place is a hidden gem. Everything I've had here has met or exceeded expectations. The women that run this place, though a little shy, are always more than accommodating. I am somewhat of a tacos aficionado and have eaten many tacos in many locales... These are some of the best I've had anywhere. The tortas are wonderful, too."}
{"text":"So the reviews of this place looked pretty good and sometimes little hole in the wall places are the best for food. NOT this place. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and I said it comes with beans and rice right and she said yes. I also ordered a chicken, shrimp and steak taco. I got home and there was no rice and beans when I called they put me on hold for five minutes to find somebody who spoke English. The woman proceeded to tell me that I didn't order the quesadilla with rice and beans and I said $10 for a straight up quesadilla is ridiculous expensive. She said no I charged you $6.99 for just the quesadilla, then why did she agree with me when I said the quesadilla comes with rice and beans. There is definitely a language barrier if you don't speak Spanish. The quesadilla was OK the chicken taco don't get it, it is dry! The shrimp taco was pretty good the beef taco was extremely chewy. I had a better taco from the truck around the corner! I'm not ever coming back to this place."}
{"text":"This is a really fast real cheap good food restaurant. Its the second time I visit them and I'll probably become a regular. I love the passion fruit juice and all the food I tried it's well seasoned. It's a real authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Very authentic and made fresh. Order ahead or be prepared to wait for take out.  The  burritos are delicious. (Light on the beans though). Not a place for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Two dollar al pastor tacos and a Coke hecho en Mexico makes me a happy chica.  Little tiny counter with a few tables to dine in. Kitchen looked spotless.  Great place to stop across the street from Bargain Hunters.  This would equal a delightful afternoon."}
{"text":"Small place, limited menu but it's authentic mexican and really good"}
{"text":"Good food, but they ripped me off by bringing an inflated Bill with no itemization. But what am I to do? Nobody speaks English.  Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Now to say I am NOT a Mexican food fan  would be an understatement but my wife is
 I found this place just by chance and I have fallen in love with it. 
for me to say that about a Mexican restaurant means an awful lot 
I highly recommend their food I highly recommend their sauces they are some really nice people and the price is very inexpensive give this one a try and you won't be sorry"}
{"text":"Tengo 3 años viniendo a este lugar y hoy estoy decepcionado según el dueño del lugar tengo que comprar más de 2 tacos para que me puedan hacer mi orden yo y mis compañeros tenemos comprando diario a este lugar y la forma en la que me trataron como cliente te dice que no tienen la ética ni educación para administrar un negocio tú no puedes decirle al cliente que no te puede vender 1 taco solo porque al cosinero le da flojera hacer 1 taco"}
{"text":"This place is BOMB ! So fresh and so filling I could eat here everyday ! And they have good customer service I recommend to anyone looking for good authentic mexican food and the dining area is cozy"}
{"text":"Good tacos, quick service and cheap prices . I ordered two of the lengua tacos that was good but not great they made them fresh to order and the location is pretty convenient probably wouldn't go again but it's worth a try."}
{"text":"The quality of food has declined since my last review. The grilled steak meat on my sons tacos were like thin slices of dried beef jerky. The watery mole sauce on my daughters enchiladas were heavily seasoned in cinnamon. I kindly asked the waitress before ordering this item to allow me to taste the sauces of their enchiladas to make sure they were up to par. My request was refused. That is the first time this has happened to me and I should have known to get up and eat elsewhere.  My pozole was a bowl of red grease with overly soaked mushy hominy beans and small chunks of what might be pork. Might have been passable as some unknown stew but this was not an authentic pozole. It was served with two bean tostadas garnished with waterlogged romain lettuce shreds. I returned the enchiladas and requested a cheese quesadilla, which ended up being filled with yellow cheese instead of quesadilla, chihuahua, or mozzarella cheese.

Overall, each of our meals were not palatable and could never pass as authentic flavorful Mexican dishes. Meats are definitely cheap cut and not fresh. 

After doling out $38 for food that was barely touched, I made sure to tip the waitress for at least being somewhat attentive. 

This place gets busy and seems to have a local following. The staff are busy hard at work keeping tables cleared and floors swept. However, the quality of their meats, vegetables, and food prep are very questionable. Their pricing is highway robbery.

Attached are pictures to provide an idea of what I described above."}
{"text":"A co-worker told me about the location a while back and I decided to try it out. By far, one of the best and most authentic restaurants I've been to. Everything is fresh and made to order. Tacos are cheap and the tortas are delicious."}
{"text":"Omg I didn't find this place soon enough. I love the tacos. I came back twice in one week! I had the regular season pork tacos that came with cilantro and onion then the next day I came back for the special steak+sausage taco combo that came with lettuce, tomatoes, avocado and cheese, plus 2 regular chicken taco on top. Best authentic tacos thus far!!! I am still craving for more! And their less than $2 per taco!!! Also try the maracuya drink, it's so refreshing."}
{"text":"Though not much has survived long in this location (going way back to La Bamba and continuing through the fruit and veggie stand), the Taqueria Express has managed to eke out an existence for some time.

Please note: When they say \"express\", it does not necessarily mean what you think it means. While service isn't really slow, it's not fast food - it's more like \"sparse\" or \"simple\" than \"fast\".

That doesn't mean that it's bad - quite the contrary, in fact. What you get isn't bad at all, just be prepared for what you're getting (and perhaps brush up on some Spanglish, because there isn't a lot of English spoken in these parts).

What they really need to do is open a quick-serve window to the park and ride and I suspect they would do really well."}
{"text":"Keep in mind their sign actually reads Taqueria Express.

This is a tiny little taco stand carved out of Fruteria El Pueblo just west of Woodlands on Albemarle. Orders are placed at a window overlooking a stuffed, hot kitchen. Food is quick and simple. Menu's surprisingly large - lots of tacos, quesadillas, burritos - didn't seen any Salva-or-Ecuadorian influences on there. Language could be an issue if you no tengo un pequeno espanol.

I have a thing for tortas, so that's what I got - and it was good. A little pricey (6.50 for huevos y queso) but easily one of the better ones I've had in CLT. Soft, sweet teleras, Monterey-Jacky cheese, shredded lettuce, some jalapenos. A mess to eat, but whatevs.

This isn't the \"IT\" torta, but it's totally worth a stop."}
{"text":"I love this place tacos are super cheap under $2 a taco. The pastor tacos are the best!! The natural fruit juices are good as well!"}
{"text":"This place has been redone since  the last time I was in Charlotte. It used to be a bit more rustic looking but now it is warm and inviting! Walked in after a gym session dying for some tacos. 

First let me say, I love tacos and I love authentic tacos and friendly service. This place at least had authentic tacos. The tacos were decent ordered the carne asada, carnitas, and al pastor. The al pastor was extremely flavorful and I would totally order it again, the other two on the other hand...never gain. The meat was subpar in quality and the seasoning was nonexistent the only saving grace was the decent salsa and clearly handmade tortillas! 

Now to the customer service, maybe I am nitpicking, but it really irked me. I walked in and the person in front of me ordered in Spanish, I also order in Spanish, the girl responds in English, I respond in Spanish. She refuses to speak to me in Spanish. I then ask her about salsa in the togo box and she ask if I want chips and salsa....like no...I want to know if you put salsa verde in the box. She tells me she doesn't know what they put in the box. I ask her if she can check, she just looks at me. 

I want to support local businesses and I want to have yummy authentic tacos, but with the attitude, I will take my business to some other taqueria up Central Ave. There are plenty that use better quality meat and are way friendlier."}
{"text":"Ok so ive been craving Mexican tacos for some time now. So while out running to the neighborhood store  I smell some awesome food. I didn't know what it was and asked the cashier. He said it's probably that Mexican restaurant a few blocks up. What???? I pull in and instantly know that, yes this is what I've been smelling. I order 3 shredded pork tacos with avocado. After dressing my tacos with alittle salt, jalapeño sauce, a squeeze of lime and add my radishes. I took my first bite and started singing.....Sir Mix a Lot/ Nikki Manji  remix OH MY GOD....Becky  Lmao I'm through lol #authenictacos #whyhaventibeenherebefore"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and flavorful and I always get that authentic Mexican feel. They have great tacos, quesadillas, and their sopes are amazing. But every time I order take out, the price is different, even though I get the same thing every time. I don't understand why that is."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, NC. Bathrooms could be improved but food is def delicious and for reasonable prices. Not all the girls speak English so be prepared to practice your Spanish."}
