{"text":"Okay not great. Ordered cheese steaks and the steak was basically minute steaks on a bun. Some herbs and I asked for tomatoes and onions. But if you're use to real cheese steak these fall short. Pat's and Gino's in philly are tough to compete against so you'll be disappointed if you're expecting chopped steak, saut√©ed onions , etc. definitely can find better."}
{"text":"Got a Cheeseburger Sub and a Rudy's Special both were very good sandwiches. The lady at the counter was super nice."}
{"text":"If you're like me and value the bread in a sandwhich, you will definitely enjoy Rudy's.  Rudy's calls back childhood memories of tasty subs with soft, always fresh, bread and high quality meats and cheeses.  The dressing on the sandwhich has a little proprietary something-something going on which you don't get anywhere else.  It's a taste that will make you want to return the next day to get another sandwhich.  When you want a good sandwhich, go to a place that focuses on the sandwhich.  That's Rudy's.

Service was super friendly and the owner was there each time to make sure you're enjoying your food.  So glad one opened near me!"}
{"text":"Great food. The owner Doug is always there and asking if you need anything. Imagine that. The owner is actually there. Not some hourly manager. You can tell that he is passionate about his business and is always looking to please his customers. The food is awesome but just the care you get from the owner is enough to keep me coming back for a long time."}
{"text":"ITS A WINNER

very good.  get it loaded and don't forget the special herb oil.  healthy portion.  reasonable pricing.  not QUITE as tasty as the original in monroeville, but super yummy.  great speedy and courteous service.  i hope to see this place to very well.  updated, clean, great technology.  

GOOD LUCK THERE!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and awesome help! Went here 2 days in a row while visiting and moving my wife's mother!"}
{"text":"My first time here, and was extremely impressed! Food, service and environment are top notch. I'm sad I haven't tried this place before. They even have choices for picky kids, like my son who hardly ever eats. He finished the whole order of chicken tenders. Not to often do the employees at fastish food give 2 craps about the restaurant, both of the gentleman here were very attentive and very friendly. You could tell they are very proud of their product, and they should be! Great spot! Will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Better subs than anywhere in the area. Workers are always very friendly which isn't common nowadays. My favorite sub is the steak and egg but any of the subs are great. The Italian is so great as well. Can't say enough about this place. Fries are also so good if you like thincut crispy fries. I eat here now at least once a week."}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered take out. Got a hot Italian  with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and banana peppers. Oh my god, so good! Their onion rings are nicely crunchy breaded. I love that if you order a whole to go they wrap it separately. Next time I'm going to make sure to call the order in ahead of time. I will totally be back."}
{"text":"Went today after golfing and ordered 2 full Italians hot. Both of them were excellent and while we planned on saving the second half, we both are the whole thing. 

A previous reviewer mentioned the bread wasn't as good as local bakeries. The bread comes from cellones which is a local bakery. It was soft warm abs delicious. 

The food was ready in about 5 minutes and then they bagged my to-go order shortly after.  We got a kids meal(chicken fingers) which was fine but nothing to write home about but satisfied my toddler.   

I can't wait to order more from this place. I can't believe this was my first time here after they had been open so long."}
{"text":"Great subs at Rudy's!  Had the Italian and the cheese steak and both were delicious! Super friendly workers and incredibly clean!  Definitely worth a stop!!!"}
{"text":"Get the Steak and Cheese it is a mouthful.  Great Bread.  A new place to go in the South Hills"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, super clean, lots of choices, and must importantly delicious!!! Great little sub shop! Will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"First impressions are everything, and unfortunately Rudy's Subs left me with a poor impression of them.  I ordered a 1/2 size Cheeseburger Sub to go and was upsold to the daily special (includes fries and drink) for $7.99.  I wish I would've declined.  About 15 minutes later (not great speed if you're in a hurry or don't have a long lunch) they brought out my order on a tray despite having ordered it to go.  Usually this wouldn't be a big deal, but they took it back into the kitchen and took another 2 minutes to simply bag what was on the tray.  I got my food to the car and decided I would at least eat some of my fries on the way back to the office and they weren't even close to hot.  I'd have been better off having ordered a bag of chips.

The sub was OK, the fries tasted like they would have been good if they wouldn't have sat out long enough to get cold, and the service was just way too slow.  If you work at Southpointe, don't even bother coming here because you'll just end up disappointed and late coming back from lunch."}
{"text":"I had the Daily Special (your choice of any half sub, with fries, and drink = $7.99) for lunch.  I picked the \"Rudy's Special\" which is a cheese steak sub with mushrooms and peppers.  The service was excellent, provided by a very nice woman working the counter, and also a gentleman from the back came out to check on me too.  The place was very clean.  I thought the sub was good, mostly just O.K., because, like one other reviewer mentioned, I wasn't too crazy about the bread.  The fries were good, and I thought the Hershey's Kiss on the tray was a very nice touch."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new sub place today for a quick lunch. Seems to be a very family friendly place, appears to be a Canonsburg favorite. We were promptly greeted and the gentleman at the corner was very helpful after he heard it was our first visit. He explained the menu and mentioned that the Italian and the cheesesteak were the customer favorites, so that's what we went with. I had the cheesesteak hot and hubs had the Italian cold.    You can add lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles or banana peppers to whichever sub you choose. Overall they were good, I think they could have more meat personally, but they were tasty. You can get a combo meal with the 6\" sub which includes fries and a small drink. The service was excellent and the place was very clean, witnessed sweeping and cleaning the floors and tables the entire time we were there eating. I always like to eat somewhere where cleanliness is a high priority. Happy to say they also have a 15% military discount."}
{"text":"These subs are out of this world. The bread is fresh and soft, the meat is good quality (I had the turkey), and Rudy's special sub dressing is very flavorful with oil and fresh herbs. Definitely recommend. I called ahead and ordered takeout - the order was precise and on time which was important because I had to take it back to work for my other coworkers to enjoy within our lunch break. This was the first time anyone in my office has had Rudy's and I gotta say, everyone was very happy. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"50/50.  Ordered the italian hoagie, good tasting but light on the meat. Was underwhelming.  Wife got a steak hoagie with egg, was very good. Had ordered fries and fried pickles. Discovered when we got home that they forgot our fried pickles. Was looking forward to trying.  Want to like this place because the steak hoagie was great but for the price we paid and missing items not sure we will give another chance with other sub places in the area."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch with some friends. Sandwiches were solid. Staff was very friendly. Menu is fairly basic and food came out promptly and hot. The sandwiches were nothing to write home about. I got the Italian, and it was good but not great. There was not a ton of meat. The herb dressing is delicious. There are a lot of fried items on the menu. We went with fried pickles which were not freshly breaded (likely frozen), and had a hard outer surface. Very kid friendly with lots of options for children. Not a bad place to bring the kids for a quick lunch out."}
{"text":"Got to love the website stating that the subs/Rudy's is a legend.
Anyway, a nice new Rudy's recently opened.  Though, I have never been to a Rudy's, I have heard the name.
How about the price of the lunch special.  A half Sub, Fries and a Beverage for $7.99.  Perfect for me this day.  Had the Italian Sub.  It was good but not nearly as good as my FAVE.  The bread/bun was OK but again not as good as some from some of the local bakeries.  
The service was super friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Pepper steak - Good sandwiches in my opinion start with the bread. Rudy's bread compliments the fresh ingredients. Rudy's subs always reminds me of Pittsburgh. Always love it.  The owner surprized me with a taste of his new Maui wings. The wing meat was comparable with other wing places, juicy, meaty, but the favor was such a pleasant surprize. LOVED THEM!  Brings a whole new dimension to this restaurant.  Great service, clean. I will always keep coming back."}
{"text":"Had the Steak and Cheese with Egg on it. I ate the whole thing it was so delicious. I grew up in the East and love Rudy's Subs. Glad we have one in the South Hills. Will be going back agains soon."}
