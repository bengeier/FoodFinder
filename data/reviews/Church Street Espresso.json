{"text":"Love this place. I needed a convenient coffee shop that I could pop into and get a quality Americano on my walk to work. Their coffee is great. Service is friendly. Vibe is cool."}
{"text":"Great little place. We're from San Diego and decided to stop in when walking up and down Church St. We got a bunch of biscottis, gelato, and an espresso. The atmosphere is also very nice and cozy. I'd highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service! My friend was moving apartments nearby so I went to zaza to see if I could purchase a large carafe of coffee. They did not stock the heavy takeaway cardboard containers for this purpose, so the guy behind the counter offered up a large insulated thermos instead. He could have turned me away, or made me purchase 10 individual cups of coffee...but he trusted me enough to bring back his container! He also made sure I had enough sugar and milk for the move crew. 

When I returned the container, he refused my offer to pay him for using the thermos. In a sometimes impersonal city, he made his coffee joint feel like a small town one."}
{"text":"I go to this neighbourhood once a week. I went by Church Street Espresso to meet a friend of mine twice. It was convenient for me, and I had gelato twice. They have nice flavours and the price is not cheap. The staff is nice and pleasant. Inside is clean and they have comfortable seats and tables. I really liked the place, but the taste of gelato was not that good. Second time, I tried another flavour again because I wanted to like the place. I did not like the taste of gelato either. It is very nice place and I like the place. I wish they would have gelato taste better."}
{"text":"The weather is getting warmer and I'm already looking forward to their patio. They have Italian pastries at reasonable prices. The pistachio treats are to die for. Coffee is great. Owner and other staff are polite and efficient."}
{"text":"Great coffee and service! They also make a delicious Nutella latte that I highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"I love this spot. It has the nicest vibe. Everyone who works here is super nice and the service is always fast and on point. I especially love their great patio off of church which is a great spot to enjoy a coffee or pint. Prices are fair for their products and well worth it."}
{"text":"haha, I agree with Itanni B. and the theatrical overuse of \"bella\" every few minutes. In Italy, it is natural, here it feels like a bad sales ploy! the cafe, etc is not bad, miss Java. But the irritating \"bella\" drove me nuts!"}
{"text":"Coffee is good. The patio is awesome. Nice little place!! When you don't feel like a big chain coffee shop, this place is a must."}
{"text":"Coffee, gelato, beer,and pastries are all awesome. The patio is very nice, the staff are nice and kind."}
{"text":"Cute little place with friendly service. I had a Mocha Latte,  it was made very well and my partner had the hazelnut/baccio gelato. It was delicious (I obviously had some hehe). The prices are comparative to any other coffee/gelato shop. I like that it's at the end of the Gay Village strip, and is a bit less frequented. It's nice to walk in and have a choice of seats! But that said, it seems to be well visited. They also have a patio, which is great cus the neighbourhood has a lot of dogs. Of course, winter will be upon us soon, but I imagine it's quite a popular patio on summer days (and if it isn't, it should be!)."}
{"text":"Had a great chat with the server. Awesome customer service and almond chocolate croissants"}
{"text":"I just watched the owner of this business chase down and assault someone. It was absolutely disgusting and I would not feel safe at this establishment."}
{"text":"They made me an iced Vietnamese coffee at my request. Dam good. Friendly staff. Relaxing ambience"}
{"text":"I was passing by and was hungry. Atmosphere is relaxed and the cashier is friendly. I Ordered only the chicken wrap so i can not comment on anything else. It was so yummy, it's a wrap filled with pulled chicken w little chipotle sauce w nothing else which very much matches my taste. I can not comment on anything else but if you are tired of chain coffeeshop this spot should definitely be on ur list."}
{"text":"I loved my experience at Church Street Espresso! The staff were super friendly and helpful, the iced americano I had was smooth and creamy, and the cheese and chive scone the barista recommended was super tasty and fresh!
While the inside space isn't super stroller or wheelchair friendly, Theo outdoor patio is large, with great seating!"}
{"text":"Best espresso in Toronto. 

I have traveled extensively and this place rivals my favorite international coffee spots. I am obsessed with coffee like any good Canadian and this place makes me feel like I am drinking what I deserve."}
{"text":"Settling into my new 'hood, I noticed this adorable little place, first by it's patio.
I decided to drop by for a coffee.

The patio was great, and there was ample shade which was so welcomed on a 35 degree day.

They've got nutella biscottis for about $3, sandwiches, beer on draught, lattes, tea, alcoholic beverages, perrier, san pellegrino, pastries, bagels, and other delicious looking snacks.

This is such a nice space. They also have wifi here, so I'll be coming back to work. It wasn't too crowded and I loved the patio.

My mocha was absolutely delicious. Really happy to have this place in my neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"This place feels like a little piece of Italy in Toronto and reminded me of going for cafe on the sunny beaches of Sicily in the summer. Serves gelatos, classic pastries, sandwiches and the traditional espresso style drinks. I had an espresso and chocolate almond croissant to go. Espresso had a creamy tan froth and the croissant was flakey with a nutella like chocolate center. Really hit the spot and started my day off right."}
{"text":"Nice improvement over the past coffee shop tenant.
In the surrounding blocks there are 2 BETTER coffee shops...  The competition makes a better latte/flat white.
Nice interior and staff."}
{"text":"A cute little spot in the village. 
Love the size of their patio - it is incredible for people watching on Church street. One of my new faves lol.

I would suggest a seat under one of the umbrellas during the summer, it will save you from a sunburn.

Friendly barista, very happy to help you if you aren't sure what to get.

If you have a few people to meet, this has a lot of variety in seating. Everything from small tables to outdoor sofas with cushions. It's kinda awesome, my friends."}
{"text":"I am not sure who is writing all these bad reviews I am having the Espresso and Gelato and it is the perfect cool pick me up on a summer afternoon, a good friend of mine told me about this place and the people are friendly and helpful, the espresso has a great flavour, but when you add in some tiramisu gelato its outstanding! Not too many European style cafes in their neighbourhood if you ask me and this one is worth trying."}
{"text":"This is my local. The coffee is top notch. Cozy and trendy. The music is good and soft enough for conversation. Baked goods are always fresh. And a nice beer and wine selection when you don't want complicated, just a quick something on your way"}
{"text":"Out of towner, looking for the best summer patio cafe ambiance in Toronto. Pretty sure I found it here. Nice cozy lounge furniture, picturesque corner with lovely trees and ivy covered buildings. Oh, the iced coffee and Nutella biscotti were quality!"}
{"text":"Church Street Espresso is really coming into its own as a community staple. As with any new business there can be a rocky start and a period of exponential growth. CSE is coming through the other side of this period and establishing a warm and friendly neighbourhood clientele through the charm of the owner. This sense of community and the authenticity of the drinks gives this cafe a truly European essence."}
{"text":"The staff are super nice and the whole vibe of the place is very relaxing and nice. The gelato is great, you can get drinks and their patio is always busy. Personally love the macchiato here, always made great"}
{"text":"My original review was for Zaza, but it has since been purchased by a different operator, and thus, it deserves an updated review. 

Over the last few months I have been coming here pretty regularly. The reason why I have become a fan of this place, is not only because of the great coffee (gelatos are still too expensive), but because of the chill vibe, and cool owner. Every time I am here, I get quick and efficient service, and are left alone to relax. I particularly love their patio. You could literally sit there for hours, and no one bothers you. I was surprised to learn that they also sell beer and that they will soon be selling other mains, besides sandwiches! I heard lasagna is going on the menu."}
{"text":"Great coffee and nice space. The espresso is consistently good and they have a nice array of coffee related snacks. There's a full bar too, which is a nice option for later nights."}
{"text":"Great local cafe! Really friendly helpful staff with a cosy vibe and a lovely patio. Selection of beverages and food is also really strong and tastier than some of the other nearby cafes."}
