{"text":"Visited with a big group for a birthday celebration .    Super service, great food!  A good selection for differing diets.  Friendly wait staff and a nice outdoor patio.   We will be back !"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely incredible. From the delicious grilled chicken salads, homemade soups to incredible turkey burgers to fish etc everything is top notch. The service is great. The wait staff is so friendly and so nice. The restaurant resides very close to the base of Pinnacle Peak. The prices are very reasonable and I have never been disappointed. I hope this review brings more people to go to this well deserved restaurant.)"}
{"text":"Once again Dawn and her crew have satisfied our hunger with good food and a friendly environment. I guess that is why we keep coming back. Ann had her usual, the Cobb Salad, yum. I usually have the sea scallops, but this time I tried something totally different,the liver and onions with saut√©ed spinach on the side, and sweet potato fries, Most excellent.   

 Back again after the remodeling.   Ann had the signature Pinnacle Salad and I had my usual Sea Scallops over mushroom risotto. Food is still great atmosphere is better."}
{"text":"What an unbelievable restaurant!   The waiter was awesome and the meal was unsurpassed!  I had the Gorgon zola Steak with Cajun pasta. I've never tasted a dish better. Presentation was awesome and the staff was top notch. 
Alex was a great waiter and deserves huge kudos!  
It's worth every penny and the drive if you need to. Thank god we live close by. My new all time restaurant"}
{"text":"The new ownership has painted the walls and ruined the service.  We no longer feel welcomed or appreciated. :("}
{"text":"I literally never write reviews. Like maybe one every 4 years. I am also super laid back, worked as a server and then bartender for years...and am not a picky eater.  Went for happy hour...literally, the chips and salsa were bagged chips and Tostito salsa. And the guacamole was brown. This food is all straight off of the SYSCO truck. I could have gone to the Cirlcle K and brought the same shit home."}
{"text":"Decor needs major work inside the restaurant but food was a pleasant surprise. We went early and it was too hot to eat on the lovely patio so we picked a table in the back with ugly banquet chairs. We weren't sure about the place and we just going to have a drink and an app and leave. We decided to stay due to the friendly service and good app (I forget what it was) and all four of us enjoyed our meals. Nothing over the top spectacular but no complaints at all. They lost a star for the decorating, otherwise four stars. We will definitely go back sometime but when we can be on the patio."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly, they have lots of great items on the menu and stella on draft. The burgers are great and I especially love the ribs."}
{"text":"The food is good, the new look is awesome, but the service is why we come.  Dawn and Josh have made this place what it is.  It's very sad to me to say Josh is no longer.  We do not come here for the owners.  The only reason a place like this makes it is for the people who work so hard to please the customers.  Those who forget the reason why they  are successful, will soon not get the support of the locals who made them."}
{"text":"Excellent food and beer after an amazing hike. The California burger and quinoa salad were delicious. We always eat light after hiking and, they let us split everything and didn't charge us for a second plate. Dawn was a great server, very kind, welcoming, and knowledgeable. We will be back the next time we visit this area."}
{"text":"Recently pinnacle grille has deteriorated. Living close to this restaurant made it our go to, however the last visit sealed the deal and we will not return. Ordered dinner as usually with a calamari appetizer, the calamari was cold ( partial frozen) and we made this obvious to are waiter who acted unconvinced. The owner who was present completely ignored us and we actually had to request to the waiter that we would not pay for the appetizer when the bill arrived. Pinnacle grille needs better ownership/management/waiters. For now will drive further into town to enjoy a consistent meal with actual owners that care."}
{"text":"This place is always consistent, very good food. The menu had a little bit for everyone. Recently renovated, the bar is impeccable, the patio is expansive. My favorite place for local happy hour, probably the best Buffalo wings I have had!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places in the north Scottsdale area.  The food without question is always good and innovative  and comes with surprisingly modest prices.  Larry and his crew are the best.  My husband  says coming here is like going to the \" Cheers Bar\" from TV.  Everyone is always pleased to see you and and will offer up advice to help you make your food choices easier.  
The outdoor patio is our favorite and with the weather cooling finally the softly lit patio is a perfect place to dine.  Dogs are allowed outside and never seem to be a distraction.  Water containers are freely offered for your pooch.
This is truly not only a good food experience but a bit of a \"welcome home\" and we are glad to see you kind of place.
You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Pinnacle Grille, and we went with another couple on a week night.  When we arrived, the hostess told us to sit anywhere we wanted.  We chose a table in the back room so that we could be away from the door.  The front room was too cool for us. 

 We ordered drinks, and settled in for conversation and to decide on our dinner choices.  About 20-minutes into our visit, a woman (I presumed her to be the owner) asked us if we would move over one table.  She said a group of 25 was going to come in, and she needed our table to add to the set up. The group was gathering to watch \"Family Feud\" because some of them were contestants on the episode airling that evening.

We had the choice of moving to a table near the large group (would very likely be too noisy), or moving to one in the front room (would be too cool).  Not great options, but we chose the front room, so we could have conversation.  The owner never thanked us for moving, nor acknowledged that her request caused us some inconvenience.  In fact, none of the restaurant staff did.  We thought that was rude and inhospitable.

Our food was average. I had the \"chop steak\", which tasted quite good.  However, the plating was unappetizing and sloppy.

I'm not sure we will return."}
{"text":"Will never go back again! Served raw chicken and not comped for it! Owner was very disrespectful! Been there a couple of times and the food was usually good, service isn't the greatest. Went the other nice for dinner, was seated and the owner told us they were down a server and hoped this wouldn't inconvenience us. Ordered the chicken tenders as an appetizer, they came out and looked crispy, went to take a bite and the chicken was raw and frozen, not even cooked. I was very upset, told the server and she apologized. Was skeptical about the rest of the meal, my salad wasn't anything special. The server brought us the check and said she took off 10%....our bill was only $30 thats $3 off of the $9 chicken tenders that we didn't eat. I got a hold of the owner told him I felt this was wrong, and he laughed in my face. The owner was very rude and asked me what I felt he should do about it. After arguing he finally took off the chicken but didn't comp our meal. The way we were treated was unacceptable and rude and I will never go back to this restaurant again!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst experience my family has had in a long time!  We went out for breakfast with a party of 8.   Everyone's toast was burnt (and I mean really burnt).  I asked for new toast and it never came.  When I asked about it, the server was annoyed that I would bug her again.  When she finally brought me my toast a HALF HOUR LATER, it was so disgusting I can hardly describe.  They had put it on the grill which was clearly filthy.  Not only was the toast burnt again, but it had a black filth - almost moldy look to it.  When it was pointed out to the server, she didn't apologize and just seemed irritated. 

My daughter's bagel was also burnt.  The watermelon was old. We asked for new watermelon but the server told us all the watermelon was like that.   We had to ask the server for everything and each time she left she was gone 5-10 minutes.  The restaurant was not even crowded.  

When we asked to speak to a manager, she told us there was no manager.  She wouldn't give us his name and said he wouldn't be in until 5 p.m.  AWFUL Service, AWFUL Food - we will never go there again!"}
{"text":"Food is always awesome.  Needs a good manager.  Service is horrible.  Have visited 6 times and service has been very very poor.  Opened at 11 today. Had no servers.  Bus boy waited on us.  Maybe they should hire bus boy to service.  Not sure the intent of the owners as i doubt this delicious place makes it because of horrible management and service"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!
We were a group of four trying to eat at Pinnacle Grille the other night with a reservation. As soon as we walked in the hostesses seemed annoyed with everyone. The hostess told us we did not have a reservation and that it would be a 30 to 40 minute wait. After trying to figure out what happened to our reservation for ten minutes the hostess said she put our name down wrong. Even though we had a reservation they brought us to a terrible table location that was very unclean. We had no service for about 15 minutes when there were plenty of people standing around. Our server, an older woman, was rude to us as if we were not welcomed to be at her table. After ordering our food we waited an hour for it to arrive. We asked a bus boy who the man was walking around and they said it was the owner. Maybe he should have been in the kitchen instead of walking around aimlessly looking at our wives. The food was terrible and came out wrong. We were very specific on what we wanted and received a cold and incorrect meal. Our waitress only checked on us one time and didn't even bother to listen to our concerns with the food, though she seemed to be talking to her other customers for a while. After finally finishing our unappealing meal we ordered a dessert in hopes that we would be more pleasantly surprised. One of the employees removed the dessert from a box in the refrigerator and didn't even bother to hide it. If we wanted a pre-made, microwaveable, frozen dessert, we would have gone to Walmart instead. We finished our dessert and had to wait another 20 minutes until our check arrived. No one came to pick it up so we brought it to another gentleman who took another 10 to bring us our receipt. Overall, don't waste your time here. Overpriced for the horrible service."}
{"text":"Something has happened. Was the best until they shut down for health dept. problem. Then reopened with bad menu and just bad food. Wet, sloppy plates (I. E. Mashed potato towered chicken & beef) and gone are the really good taco plate and linguine and clams. Please bring back the old chef and menu. Sadly only thing left on the menu to eat are the burgers and sandwiches."}
{"text":"If this place wasn't so close to our house I definitely would not come here. The service really depends on server and it is very hit or miss and often phony friendly attitude. The food quality and portions are very inconsistent. The owner is often physically present, but has no idea what's going on or what's even being served. Our food has been wrong, burnt, stale, raw, over cooked so many times...you name it and they've served it. I've even gone in to pick up food before and no one knew where my order was...they gave it to someone else. You think a manager, the owner, someone would take responsibility for it...not here! If you live in the area and really need something to eat, that's one thing, but personally it's worth driving 5 more minutes in the opposite direction of this place. Maybe new ownership and a new manager would help."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch in April and ate outside in the really nice patio area.  My hamburger was great but they didn't get my dining partner's meal right and he wasn't very happy.  On the other hand I had taken a friend from out of town here in Feb and we had a wonderful early dinner around 5pm on a Friday night (it was crowded already).  She loved her fish and I had chicken marsala that was excellently prepared and was delicious.  Started with guacamole -- also great.  Agree with some of the other reviews that consistency is an issue but overall I've had nice experiences there"}
{"text":"This is a good neighborhood restaurant with a big menu.  The patio is really big with lots of heaters.  They do allow dogs on the patio.  The people here are very friendly.  The burgers are reliably good.  The salads are huge.  Generally its a good place to go if you didn't plan dinner and now everyone is hungry.  Their lunches are good also.  Not expensive.  We loved hiking Pinnacle Peak and then stopping at Pinnacle Grille for a bite to restore our energy.  
Last year they renovated the inside and its very inviting with a great bar, sports on the TVs and new and fresh bathrooms.  Overall a good place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Its now the place my whole family celebrates their birthday! A wonderful menu keeps mom and dad happy, the cool patio at sunset keeps me coming back, and my niece and nephew love the huge sparkling birthday candles.  I've had everything on the menu and you will not be disappointed. Food quality is amazing, and the prices are great! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch.  Food was quite good, but the service was terrible.  I had to ask twice for mustard and then twice for a refill on my draft beer.  As we ate, several tables finshed and left.  No bus persons ever showed up to clear the tables and the birds started to flock onto the patio.  It didn't seem like anyone was in charge"}
{"text":"It took them twenty minutes to get our water, which they did not ask us about.  This is a restaurant, which should be about service,  not giving what they want to give.  They then did not give us any straws with our water, really?!  It took another twenty minutes to receive our bill and our waiter did not give a refill on the water.  Needless to say, my friend and I were not happy at all with the service at this establishment."}
{"text":"I've been coming here regularly for YEARS but after today I will never return. Hostess was so flat I felt like we were bothering her to be seated. Took 15 minutes before even seeing our young waiter who addressed customers as 'dude'. Had to ask 3 different staff 3x to get a water let alone our drinks.  
We should've left then. 

Never refilled coffee once, food came without 4 sides ordered. No silverware. Waiter walked off as we were still talking, asking for sides & silverware. He never returned with any sides, drink refill or silverware We rotated the with 3 young waiters and they were all rude spaced out kids. The final comment from one waiter was priceless \"how'd you like the burrito? The cook just throws a bunch of crap in it\". Marvelous...

Overheard 3 other tables complaining they never even got menus after being seated 15 mins, etc. Many restaurants have disastrous days for understandable reasons but it wasn't busy & we had 3 waiters (?) who totally ignored everyone. Never again."}
{"text":"Went to PP grill today with my grandson
Was told by a sick snotty lady that my tiny dog could not sit in my lap
We were there five days ago and several times before that and there never was a problem
We left will never return as their attitude was rude and frankly only went there because of the dog friendly patio
Ya not so much and it's just average food with slow service
Skip Sunday mornings it's really slow"}
{"text":"We've visited Pinnacle Grille many times pre- and post-facelift. Our experience is always the same: good food, awful service. The wait staff is both surly and slow. I realized on my recent visit, last weekend, that it's always the same experience here:

It takes forever for the server to take drink orders
They don't check on you after delivering food
The drinks aren't refilled
You have to ask for your server to get a check

We used to chalk it up to someone having a bad day. But then we realized that every time we leave Pinnacle Grille we say the same thing, \"Why do we come back?\""}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! I was reading through some of the reviews and the one that really disappointed me was from Marty Z. She stated the food was bad and much better restaurants than this place?? Don't waste your time or your money??? REALLY???? I have been going to Pinnacle for over 4 years and not ONCE have I been disappointed....The staff (especially Dawn & Josh)and the food is the best!......And it's DOG FRIENDLY!"}
{"text":"Great service! Which is a refreshing change from the lack luster customer service that seems to be the norm in AZ. We have been back just for the service, but the food is good too. Save room for the chocolate lava cake."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite restaurant. Nice ambience, large patio, and the burgers are awesome! We can really converse and actually hear each other in this restaurant. Each time we go our server is Patrick who is a very good server. We plan to take our parents there for lunch this weekened. We know they will love it."}
{"text":"Really nice place! We came here last night in a group of 7 and it was a great experience. The service was quick and friendly and the restaurant is good-sized with the right amount of tables so you don't feel cramped.

The menu is very diverse and I love the \"make your own salad\" or \"burger\" selection that each had a ton of different options. Their portions are very large and can easily be shared or taken home for a lunch or another dinner.

I made my own salad with solid albacore tuna with their fresh veggies and the balsamic dressing on the side. Everyone's order was correct and prompt and prices were great. For 7 people who had dinner, some had appetizers and everyone had tea or soda, it was just under $100. We are making this our standard place for our monthly meetings now."}
{"text":"Was not the destination I was hoping for. I googled pinnacle peak steakhouse and found out its permanently closed as a pulled into their parking lot. This place was plan B. Our party of 5 was seated immediately outside as we desired under the blood moon. It was a great experience food and service was awesome. Price was very reasonable. It's an hour away from home but will return."}
{"text":"Love this place. By far my favorite quick place to eat in the area. Absolutely love the Strawberry Kale Salad. Their fries aren't too bad either."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch and  waited for at least 45 min for two soups and finally asked to pay for our beer we had and canceled the soup. Waiter never put in our order!  There were maybe  6 tables on the deck at any time during the time we were there and saw at least 5 different people waiting tables or bringing out food. All the people passing by us and no one asked to see if we wanted anything including another drink. We had to flag down our waiter then. Poor management! Waiter didn't charge us for our beer but we left without eating and will never go back."}
{"text":"Our first visit.
1 star for receptionist. She was aloof when I called to make the reservation, and seemed bothered and curt when we came in. Maybe not a very happy young lady.
3 stars for the waiter. Seemed like he was in a hurry; we weren't. But did alter dishes to one of our parties liking. And explained that each item was prepared to order, so it is not a problem to make changes. Seemed to abandon us after entrees were served, had to ask another server for an item that was ordered and not delivered (they brought it out quickly after we asked).
5 stars for the cocktail service directly from the bar, even though we were not sitting at the bar.
5 stars for the appetizers.
5 stars for the entr√©e's."}
{"text":"Have been here before but have never sat outside. Had Eddie as our server tonight and he was AMAZING!! So attentive and all around great service. Also the Calamari is so good! Unfortunately didn't capture a photo of it because it was gone..."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I am blown away by the new \"burger\" added recently to the menu.  It is all protein, no soy and tastes fantastic. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service. I ordered the Cobb salad. It was ok. Nothing spectacular. The ingredients weren't chopped up finely like in most Cobb salads--they were big chunks--not to my liking.  My husband ordered the tuna salad sandwich. He stated it was very good. Homemade raspberry salad dressing was spectacular. We ordered the apple pie for dessert. The waitress asked if we wanted ice cream and we said \"no.\"  She said as she walked away that the ice cream makes it taste so much better.  When she served it, the pie was heated and she added the ice cream anyway because she said it just makes it taste so much better.  That was such a nice (and correct) touch--and she didn't charge for the ice cream.  It was awesome. I think the key to this place is to stay away from the salads and order sandwiches and entrees.  The prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"We are year round residents who work in Healthcare, we have been eating here for a couple of years and have seen a gradual decline over the past 6 months. 
Food preparation, presentation and quality is terrible
The long term waiting staff who always had a smile and a joke seem to have checked out - the newer staff do not have a clue and are not being mentored.
The young lady hostess wearing the skimpy black shorts needs to understand stretching  over the tables can be damaging to the customers health !!!! 
The renovations did smarted the place up but to be honest I cannot see it surviving the summer based on current services.   
Come on new owners, there is more to life than money, pull your finger out or get out and let it be managed as it was in the past......."}
{"text":"I did read the reviews before coming here, but I wanted to give it a try. We were seated promptly, and the drink order was taken, nice start. Marilyn gave some suggestions that were ok, the taco were not as amazing as she lead us to believe. The ahi tuna was over cooked. The food was just ok. The issue we had was the service. Marilyn and the other waitress were busy behind the wall talking with other staff or sitting at a table with a customer who we believe worked there. Trying to flag down another waitress when she walked by didn't work, she never acknowledged us. And to end it off, the busboy  coming out with another restaurant apron just summed it up."}
{"text":"Great place! Great food and excellent service! Highly recommend! I love their grilled cheese and creamy tomato basil soup. The burgers are also superb!"}
{"text":"I went to Pinnacle Grille with my girlfriend for lunch.  The menu really looks awesome, but unfortunately neither of us were very hungry.  I ended up getting the Cobb salad and it was really good.  Everything was fresh, the greens, the grilled chicken, the bleu cheese, everything.  The  vinaigrette was the one thing I wasn't super pleased with.  So, if you get this salad, try a different dressing.  My girlfriend got the fat free sesame dressing on her salad, it was really good.

I really liked the ambiance and the service was really good.  I think the only thing keeping this place from being really popular is the location, it's like being on the moon out there!  However, I would certainly go back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first visit to Pinnacle Grill and I have to say I was very happy we gave it a try. It was kind of empty due to seasonality, but that actually worked in our favor as we got some time to chat with our awesome server Lisa. She was a lot of fun, great with the kids, and made some wonderful recommendations, along with stellar service. The menu is in somewhat of a transition as they are adding new items and taking off some others. Overall the menu is diverse offering everything from great burgers to higher end tasty dishes. My son built his own burger which was delicious. Quality Angus beef cooked as ordered. My daughter ordered the fried calamari and thought it was great. My wife ordered the ribs and enjoyed them as well. I had the chicken marsala which was a varied version of the traditional, but it was delicious with a richly flavored sauce. Also as a starter we shared some chicken wings and they were nicely cooked and tasty... not too spicy either. One of the great qualities of this place is that the food is original and fresh with everything homemade as far as we could tell. It is so hard to find good quality food as we have become overrun by the Olive Garden style restaurants of today. This place is not a chain! Great food at a reasonable price. I will be happy to go back in the future and look forward to trying new menu items as well as being served by Lisa. Enjoy Pinnacle Grill as we did. A great place tucked away off the beaten path, but well worth the excursion."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood family owned restaurant!  I usually sit at the bar, and Leon takes great care of us!  I do not eat meat, so for me to rave about menu options, is really special!  I had the Salmon entree tonight, and it was unbelievable!!  Cocktails are amazing and huge!  Love the cosmo that Leon serves, so full, I can't even pick it up till I have a few sips. Tried a sip of the espresso martini it was to die for!  Super cold beers on tap in nice frosty glasses. Diverse wine list and plenty of choices for by the glass options.  Happy hours are fun with a nice selection of items on the happy hour menu.  If you have a sweet tooth, the Bread Pudding is divine, I could drink that caramel sauce!  Thank you to Ralph, Jean and John for giving us locals a nice gathering place to meet up with old and new friends, and for having a great menu with consistent quality food at a great price point. Thanks to everyone for making us feel at home!"}
{"text":"We live in Troon within a mile of this location so we were very excited to try the food.  Its tucked back in a strip mall off the main road so keep you eyes open or you'll miss it for sure.  When we pulled up and got out of the car our mouths started watering from the smell in the air.  We were told the burgers where outstanding and that they had some new items on the menu.  My wife ordered the ribs and I ordered burgers and fish sandwiches for the girls and I.  The rub on the ribs was excellent however the ribs were obviously boiled then kissed on the grill so no smokey goodness but decent flavor thanks to the rub so lets give them a B-.  I should have ordered the regular burgers because the sliders where lame compared to many we've had around the valley and the fish sandwiches were so greasy we took a couple of bites and left both sandwiches on the plate.  All in all we were not impressed however the owner or manager came by our table and was very friendly and the service was good not great. Bottom line we will give it another try and update the review later.  We are going to try them for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wonderful morning coffee place! Nice people."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever ordered here has been top notch and a good value. Great service. Definitely a place you can eat at often without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"The menu is large and while that can be an alarm bell, here it's all delicious. It's a grille--not the Waldorf, so I rate it for what it is. Everything is charred or cheesy or spicy or light when it was supposed to be. We had the build your own pasta, then BYO salad, plus the fish taco app. We are picky. Everything was amazing and Melanie the bar manager makes sure you're happy with it all. Her drinks are yummy and generous. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Great service. I was served by a girl named Jessica and she was great. I am picky and she made my order perfect and never let my drink go empty. I'll definitely be back because of her!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They offer a varied menu and the food is really good. The soups are to-die-for. A full bar and many TV's for sports. A heated(or not ) outside dining. 
WE go there at least once a week, you can get a great meal at a very reasonable price.
They are also doing cork recycling, one of the few that do.

A definite 5+++++ stars."}
{"text":"After hiking Pinnacle Peak yesterday my friends and I stopped here for lunch. Wanted to love this place but the table had food stuck on it. Service, though friendly was slow. Drinks took a long time and nothing fancy.  Food when it finally arrived was good but was not hot. We all had burgers and fries or onion rings. Flavor was good. Thought prices a bit high. Would go back if there hiking but would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local restaurants.  Great food at good prices.  Good drinks.  Just a good local place for a good value linch or dinner.  
Why I'm writing this review is we went there last night and had a great dinner.  My wife had a very small amount of leftovers that she asked to take home.  A mistake was made and it was accidentally trashed.  No questions ask, didn't even ask if we cared - they just made another entire meal for us to take home.  To me that is over the top!  I think there a handful of restaurants that take care of there guest properly or in this case above and beyond and this is one of them.
If you want a good home cooked meal, a pretty diverse menu, and you don't want to get a bank loan to go there - I would recommend this place.
Note they just posted summer hours and they are not open for lunch in the summer - sorry to see, as they have a great burger menu.  But I know how hard it is for restaurants these days."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burger that I have ever had!  The staff is great.  So nice and helped me with the umbrella on the patio.  Really a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"Really long menu with lots of options so you can customize every meal!  Also-- long list of soups.  Love every one I have tried so far.  Also, great service.  Very personable waitstaff who look you in the eye and engage in conversation too."}
{"text":"Really great meal!  Enjoyed the strip steak,the sides are perfectly cooked and green beans super snappy steak  cooked perfectly.  Risotto with salmon entree was also great.  Server Tim super accommodating and friendly and attentive.  Will definitely be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch today and it was amazing! Our bartender Josh was excellent and makes the best Moscow mule I've ever had! We both had the build your own burger and it was cooked to perfection. I had the bison burger and he had the Kobe beef burger. The onion rings are thick and cooked perfectly. We also had the chicken green chili soup which wasn't that great but the excellent burgers made up for the disappointing soup. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We used to live in Troon so are used to very little options in the Pinnacle Peak area. We've dinned with PG probably 8-9 times over the past 18 months.

The food can be really good but would LOVE to see more consistency in the kitchen. My favorite grilled chicken sandwich never comes out the same. Sometimes as dry as leather, and sometimes juicy and delicious.

We've also been overcharged by \"take out\" as the hostess didn't understand what we ordered. Not a big deal.

Wait times leave a ton to be desired.

I feel like they could be so good if they just tightened up their processes."}
{"text":"The Pinnacle Grille is situated along a very scenic road, north of Scottsdale.
I found it on Yelp, and was nearby.
My hubby and I shared the Nachos, which were very good, and split a burger.
The food was good, the waiter was so friendly, and the day was beautiful, just sitting outside in the sun, on the patio.
It's not a fancy place, but we really enjoyed our meal here!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed by the poor reviews for this restaurant because we've always had amazing food and service. for those of us that live out here we don't have many restaurants close to us that aren't extremely pricey or very limited food options so it is so great to have a place that offers so many options at great prices around this area! 

The place was redone within the past year, so if you haven't been back since, it is a much nicer atmosphere! The outdoor patio is heated and comfortable. 

The menu is HUGE. i mean they have absolutely anything you can think of. usually i am not a fan of these types of restaurants because the food is always average but I have to say every meal i've had here has been really good! The burger, pasta, and salad dishes are my favorite. They also have many create your own dishes so they can accommodate to anything you want. 

Although the huge menu might be nice for some people I think it's a little overwhelming and wish they would focus in on what they are best at! We will be back due to the location and the very good food. Service has always been great, and prices are decent!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, but please put a dimmer switch on the patio lights. I felt like I was either being interrogated by police or abducted by aliens."}
{"text":"When ever I want a great burger and fries, I know I'm going to Pinnacle Grill. Every thing I've tried from the menu has been excellent. Breakfast, lunch or dinner you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Wonderful scallops, yummy grille tacos and good crab Louie salad.  The service was great with Josh.  Drinks were good too. Great value!"}
{"text":"The remodel came out wonderfully!  The food was excellent.  We had the ny strip steak and chicken milanesa and it was amazing!!  I can't stop thinking about the dish!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"steak less than average.  Hard to cut and harder to chew.  Side dishes good.  Desserts not good.  Suggest having lunch, not dinner.  Nice view and friendly staff.  Sure wish food was better."}
{"text":"Since we live up the street from here, and theres not much else around, we sadly have no choice if I dont want to cook or drive far for dinner or carry out. They still cant do it right here.  It used to be great, until they sold it last year.  We keep trying, hoping something will change.  No luck. Got carry out the other night.  The Sonoran salad.  Its offered with either grilled chx breast or fried chx tenders.  What came on top of the salad was not the fried chx tenders I ordered.  It was some sort of pounded thin, heavily breaded, flat piece of chicken that was sliced.  It was so tough I gave up trying to eat it.  When you call to place a carry out order, you get a recording that says they are busy, call back.  WTF??  They also say on that recording \"if you are calling to make a reservation you must speak with a live person\" and then it goes on to say, its preferable to go on Open Table and secure a reservation online.  WTF again?  Who are these people that own this place??  They obviously know they are the only game in town."}
{"text":"Gotta love a place that had ten soup options!!! TEN!!! Love soup so loved that!!!  We sat outside and had a beautiful view of pinnacle Peak! I love that aspect of it. I had the \"make your own salad\" and they had so many different ingredients I had a hard time deciding. I ended up adding more than I was even supposed to but they just give you a nominal charge to add a few extra items. The chicken and rice soup was absolutely phenomenal! My boyfriend got the chicken tortilla soup and he loved that too. He had a Cobb salad and was very impressed with it. It was very relaxing, the atmosphere was perfect, and the view was amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant when you are in this area. Kudos to the staff because we will definitely be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Found this gem while visiting family over Christmas.  The food was fantastic! One of the best burgers I have ever had.  Friendly staff and amazing views of the mountains."}
{"text":"Met my two valentines (hubby and son) for lunch at Pinnacle Grille yesterday inbetween shifts at work.

We had been to Blu Burger on one other occassion that I can remember.  It seemed fine, albeit VERY, VERY blue inside. They re-did it tan and red inside, which looks much better (except you can still see a bit of blue along the line of the ceiling, which I find a tiny bit tacky)

My son and I go to the Blu Burger at Summit often, so I'm familiar with that menu.  This one was expanded to include lots of soups and salads.

I had my usual burger, which I asked to be prepared medium.  It was prepared close to well.  But that's ok, because it made me eat less of it :o)

The server, Jason, was really good.  I think he had the entire (nearly full) patio for his section and he managed it very well.  He was knowledgeable, prompt and friendly toward my son (which goes a long way for me).  He even brought me a bucket of ice for my Pellegrino bottle.  :o)"}
{"text":"Came here last night.  It doesn't seem right that I am giving this a 3 star review.  Nothing was particularly wrong, it just didn't click with me.  To me, the restaurant had a weird vibe when we walked in.  Smelled cigarette/cigar smoke right off the bat, probably the cigar bar in the same building is waifing over so if you are sensitive to smells, beware.  The service was good, the food was good too, so on those counts I would return but the atmosphere was just off.  When I put the entire experience together I probably won't return.  With all the restaurants in the valley I will find another place to try."}
{"text":"We were on our way to Cave Creek and decided to try somewhere different so we consulted Yelp to see where had good reviews.  It was Sunday during lunch and place was dead... so there was really no reason my burger should look and taste like charcoal.  I had the Hawaiian burger and wife had Greek Burger; neither were good but LOOKED good.  My Hawaiian burger was black on both sides like it had been on fire for awhile and my wife's was burned on one side.  My wife's Greek burger was bland.  She said it tasted like they use bottle dressing instead of making the sauce from scratch.  

We had a side salad with our burgers and they had a good assortment of lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and a few other things but the dressing wasn't very good (obviously bottled ranch, vinaigrette, and blue cheese).  I showed the waitress my burned burger but decided not to send it back since I never send food back.  I was surprised she didn't take action anyway (I would).

If they were in my neighborhood I MIGHT give them a second chance given the other reviews but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I had Marsala chicken, and it was the best dish I had in Scottsdale so far. My family had tomato soup, two salads, sweet potato fries, burger with Angus beef and they were all fantastic! I tasted grilled cheese toast and it was the only one that wasn't really good. Not to mention super nice and friendly people here. Definitely going to come back here for many times until I get to try everything here!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a renovation! Granted I remember the old very western informal place from years and years ago. 

This new restaurant is very nice; draws a good crowd, Troon demographic. My friend and I went in on a Saturday night to grab some appetizers and almost every table was full or reserved! 

We sat at the bar which was great, very friendly personable bar tenders. Prices are $$-$$$ which is normal given the area. $9 nachos on happy hour, add $4 for chicken. They were tasty! Messy as expected with nachos. 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service for the price...customer friendly and service oriented. ..they just remodeld however and bar service is very slow and drinks very weak...I don't think the bartender has much experience as he spends more time doing other things than taking care of customers...very nice remodeling job however very bright and plain in the bar....it's way to bright in that area and looks like a cafeteria or a Mc donalds...overall a nice experience"}
{"text":"First visit here - brunch after church with friends 
Nice breakfast/brunch menu / affordably priced for the Scottsdale area. I had a very nice steak & eggs presentation for $12.95.    Excellent bloody Mary's here; good wait staff. Yes we will return. See you all here"}
{"text":"This place is very close to my house.  I usually come with my friend who is also my neighbor because it is so close to home and we are usually dinning a little late (at least for me).  The place closes at 9, and when I go with my friend we usually are there between 7:45 and 8:00pm.  Some of my meals have been great, like the salmon, others not so much like the chicken dish.  Also, the server can be hit or miss.  My friend loves to order the chicken green chili soup,  One time a young server brought it over to our table and spilled almost have of it all over, he made a royal mess and didn't say a word, just walked away.  We ended up having to clean up ourselves, because it was awful.  The chicken kebabs dinner is pretty good.  They have a small wine list which is fine, a couple of wines are very nice."}
{"text":"We had a really great experience here tonight. We brought our one year old, large puppy here because they have a dog friendly patio and we want her to get more practice in different situations. The food was really good for the price point. Great calamari; tender inside with a crispy, light batter. The burgers were fantastic--I had the American waygu and my husband had the bison. The fries and the onion rings were awesome--super fresh, hot and crispy. The children's meals were actual FOOD--not reheated junk from a box. Our server, Josh, was so attentive and helpful throughout the meal--we were glad we tried this place out, we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"After a hike on Pinnacle Peak, it was natural to stop here for a quick bite. Loved the hummus because you not only get the traditional pita bread, you get sides of tomato, cucumber, carrots and celery...Since I was seeking a healthy lunch to reward my conquering of the mountain, I tried the salmon salad which was incredible with a dressing that was to die for! service is friendly and attentive without being overly intrusive. Definitely will be back to try the other menu items because it was refreshing after a hike!"}
{"text":"It often looks too busy for my taste at the Pinnacle Grille when passing by (I live up the street)... but it was empty and serene this past afternoon so we decided to give it a try for a late lunch.
 
My girlfriend and I both had 'Royal Pinnacle' angus burgers  (swiss, saut√©ed mushrooms, caramelized onion, spring mix, and tomato on a ciabatta bun). Both burgers were delicious and done exactly as ordered (one medium rare, the other well). Most burgers are around $11 including a side... both the steak fries and sweet potato fries were good. 

I just wanted to mention this after seeing 'JD A.'s review. I don't doubt his account, but also noted on Pinnacle Grille's site that a new chef from San Diego just started in May, 2011. For what its worth, the attached press release also said  \"In 2009, San Diego Tribune selected his burger as the best in the city\".  Whoever they had grilling did a great job (OK.. its not rocket science)... 

All I can say is that we were satisfied, the service was great, and we plan to return... might even brave a crowded 'Happy Hour' sometime."}
{"text":"What the heck happened to this place???  IT IS HORRIBLE! The food is the worst part of it, but the service is not much better. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!  We ordered chicken parm - what came out was nothing short of terrible. Also, ordered their Salmon. OMG - it came out completely raw. I mean red and cold. We sent it back and it came out 10 minutes later completely raw again. Even the waitress couldn't believe it.  We sent it back again and the 3rd time it came back in three pieces cooked like it was rawhide. The manager came out and treated us like we were there to mess them up. Very rude and couldn't care less about the terrible food.

The last 3 time we've been there (once for lunch and twice for dinner) in the last 6 weeks we had VERY DISAPPOINTING experiences, but this last experience was the worst by far.

WE WILL NEVER GO BACK. VERY UNFORTUNATE as it's so close to where we live. Maybe something better will move in there after they go out of business. We are not the only ones who have had similar experiences. Many of our friends have said the same thing. AVOID!!!!"}
{"text":"We thought it was great. Big menu, and the chefs pulled off our variety very well. I want to go back tonight, trying to gather support!  I has the Bistro Steak and Scallop, which looked small, but was rich and spot-on for taste.  All the other items my group had were excellent.  I'm also happy with the service and pricing. Hope we make it back tonight!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times and offered my opinion. The last two times sealed it for me I can't put myself through another meal. The food orders are often made wrong the service is terrible and even if it is a local business it's just plain not good."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been up and coming for quite a while now; Even undergoing a beautiful remodel.  Loyal white haired neighborhood patrons flock to breakfast, and dinner mostly.  Based on recent experiences with my family, their service is sub-par at best, unfortunately.  \"Just sit anywhere you can find a table\", the young pretty woman said on our most recent visit.  After fifteen to twenty minutes of waiting with no server, no one busing the previous customers half drank Bloody Mary glasses, we decided to call it quits.  On the way out, we overheard an older gentleman say he was two minutes from leaving and cooking himself some food.  The Pinnacle Grille has good food, but inconsistent service.  A message to the owners:  If you expand your business, you must be better prepared; Your service staff and management is unprepared to match the quality of your food.  It's time to regroup."}
{"text":"Been there twice both times ordered my burger \" Med.Well\" 1st time it was well done almost burnt..2nd time it was med rare almost all rare.. Service was good, salad was good, I shouldn't have to send my burger back twice. Really wished this restaurant had a better cooked burger still is a nice place. probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Even though we didn't like any of the food we had, the menu is extensive and the Reno looks great. We probably won't go back.

Specifically, 2 of us had the Pinnacle Salad and it was soggy and the canned mandarin oranges hasn't been drained. The chicken was very very cold, like just pulled from the freezer. And flavorless. It was obviously precooked way before our order.  I have had many many salads in different restaurants and the chicken is almost always fresh cooked and warm or cool but never ice box cold. 

The fish tacos were tiny! We were expecting them to be the highlight of that meal since that was the name of the dish but they were tiny, rolled up and set around a massive salad. So if that is the way its always served maybe renaming it to more accurately reflect what is actually served would be better.

The kale salad tasted good but the kale really should be cut way smaller, especially when using mature kale. 

So that was our experience"}
{"text":"Awesome soups. Had the lobster bisque. I also had the club on sourdough. It was excellent. The red pepper humus was very nice as an appetizer. Service was excellent and brisk. Well be back often."}
{"text":"We love the menu options at Pinnacle Grill and have had many very positive experiences. The staff tend to be very friendly and helpful even when they are busy. Food is great value for the price - make sure to ask for the sweet potato fries and the chicken rice soup - forget the cup - get a bowl! Say Hi to Dawn the lovely manager and she'll be happy to make sure your experience is first class!"}
{"text":"We frequented this place at least once a week, they serv a great sandwich, when they serv you that is .  After waiting 15 minutes for a menu , water or  acknowledgement by any one  on three diffrent occasions,   we called it quits..for good"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good as is the service. Dawn is exceptional, professional and personable. 

Our only criticism is that the restaurant definitely needs to be cooler. Please lower the temperature...especially in the warmer weather!"}
{"text":"My meal was spectacular.  Amazing was the Angus burger that was carefully prepared for me with herbs and fixings.  I will definitely come back again and again.  The waiter was a pleasant young man.  He made me feel welcome.  The atmosphere at the restaurant was cozy.  The snakes game was on the main big screen television and they were up by 3 runs.  The only negative comment I would make about this restaurant is the bathroom is very small.  It had one toilet and there was shit smeared on the toilet seat.  Other than that... two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Went there for a Sunday morning breakfast and it was not pleasurable. Slow service with poor food preparation. Left there with the feeling that I will not be back. There are other places that will cater to their patrons. Many people  walking around with no service. 15 minutes to get a Bloody Mary!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant for a weeknight or take out. Food is always good, service fair if a little inexperienced. Everyone is friendly and the patio is wonderful."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today, it took forever!  We had a 12:15 reservation and didn't get to sit down until 12:30, they weren't busy, they just didn't have enough staff.  We finally got our food around 1:20, the staff said \"sorry they are delayed in cooking,\" but we had BLTs and club sandwiches, so I'm not sure what took so long.....

With so many options, this won't be in the rotation."}
{"text":"A wonderfully eclectic menu, full bar, casual atmosphere and excellent service on a busy Saturday night made this a great place to have dinner. And we returned for breakfast (delicious) the next morning."}
{"text":"Great value. Nice selection for lunch - 10 different soups, salads, and nice selection of sandwiches. Love the burgers!! Close to hiking. And nice view from the patio."}
{"text":"Pleasantly Surprised to see a fabulous renovation...restaurant looks totally up to date.. twenty first century and inviting. Unfortunately the food is as mediocre as always. Almost worse. 
Obviously they didn't change anything in the kitchen. At least now you are eating in a most pleasant atmosphere !"}
{"text":"Great lunch. The Charcuterie Board was full of wonderful meats and cheeses and much larger than expected, great taste and great value.  We also had the Fajita Quesadilla which was excellent.  Great service and great food.  I will definitely be back. Can't wait until cooler weather to enjoy the patio and views!"}
{"text":"This place has improved from when it first opened. Originally it was a basic hamburger and salad place.  Now it's been renovated and the menu expanded. Besides the hamburger offerings it now includes seafood dishes.
The local's really support this place as it can get crowded. Best to make a reservation."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  We liked our first visit.  The second, tonight, had us waiting 15 minutes for a server.  We left.  We explained to the hostess why we were leaving.  She didn't seem that interested."}
{"text":"This was our neighborhood favorite and we've been going since they opened.  Although the owner was never particularly friendly, other staff made up for it and welcomed regular customers.  That is no longer the case and, in general, the staff do not seem to enjoy their work.  That's never a good sign.  Food is still good, but when you want a regular place to eat, you want your repeat business to be appreciated-that doesn't happen at Pinnacle Grille.

Re-scored this two years later.  The Pinnacle Grille has really lost its attraction.   The worst part of the experience is when you walk in the door--no welcome, you're just another burden and it proceeds from there--main difference in two years---you get to pay more for the bad experience."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. We just moved to the area and have been there twice. The food is great as is the service. A friend recommended it and we would too!"}
{"text":"Great food at good prices. The menu is varied, from fajitas to Italian to burgers and everything in between--even chicken cordon bleu!  Nice atmosphere for us locals. Service can be spotty, which should be addressed. But we will keep coming back.  Whatever you are in the mood for, they have it."}
{"text":"Good food. My girls liked it.  We were kind of cramped into our seating, but we made do.  Server nice.  We will come again."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience! Bad food , sloppy indifferent service and waitress had very strong unpleasant perfume, couldn't breath when short came to table!"}
{"text":"Well, Pinnacle Grille got a facelift and it and it does look nicer.  Wow, the meals have really gone down hill.  A year ago I gave 5 stars and now I'm only giving 2 because our service was okay.  I had the salmon entree and it had ZERO flavor and looked like a mess when it came out (I loaded it with salt to make it palatable.). Plate was messy and looked like a couple pieces of corned beef or bacon on my plate from another dish.  My girlfriend had the grilled cheese and sweet potato fries which was okay at best.  For the thickness of the bread there isn't much cheese.  See the picture of how bad the salmon dish looked.  Sorry, but it just wasn't good.  We really like Dawn and her staff, but the quality of the food is no longer any good.  We will not likely be back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour last evening. We had not been here before and I must say, I was impressed with the Happy Hour and well as everything else--well, with the service, not so much. Even so, a very minor annoyance. I thought the Happy Hour drink menu was good --$4 house wine, $2 off premium spirits. What's not to like? There was a large number of appetizers at very reasonable prices. I had Buffalo chicken wings and a patty melt. Excellent! They have a extensive burger and sandwich menu as well as a large dinner menu. Something for everyone. There is an outdoor patio which is dog friendly. I like that. The place started filling up and by the time we left it was packed. So the service was a little slow. Lots of people and a small kitchen. Relax, enjoy the beautiful views on the patio and linger a little longer. This one's a keeper."}
{"text":"The server was very nice but the food was pretty bad. Very disappointing experience.
Much better restaurants than this place don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"Food is great and comes out fast, if you can find a server who does not think your invisable. Service is horrible!! I counted 10 kids standing around and talking to each other, not one came over to us, even with me staring them down.  10 min after sitting and waiting finally someone plopped down water and walked away!!! Much later someone asked for our drink order, then came back 6 mins later. Then we waited again, for someone to take our order. Finnaly Dawn I think she is a manager took our order, was better after that. Go for the good try to stay even through the bad service."}
{"text":"OK, so I am torn here. I've probably been here a couple of dozen times under both owners. Obviously, I'm good with it. So what happened tonight? Went there with our \"far north Scottsdale\" friends like always. It has been remodeled/updated nicely. The food is still good. There was simply no service at all. At no time was the place packed, 70% at most and once our server took our orders we very literally never saw him again. After waiting about 15 minutes, I went into the bar to see if anyone had any idea where our drinks were. Eventually someone else brought them out. After quite a while our food was brought out by yet someone else and there were several errors in the dishes. We ultimately got all of our orders and the food was good. We finished and sat around talking for quite some time and finally got antsy and wanted our bill. Yet again, I had to go inside and find a hostess who finally got someone else to bring us our bill. It wasn't as though our server had quite or anything like that. I could see him. He simply wasn't interested in our table. Running a restaurant is hard enough on a good day. PPG has always done a pretty nice job. It is a shame when the (lack of) service completely detracts from the good food, nice atmosphere, etc. This stuff really needs to be addressed."}
{"text":"Worst food poisoning I've ever had . About 30 hours ago I had the Portobello burger with sweat patatoe frys, and ate my wife's \"slaw\" that came under her Salmon Teriyaki. Was throwing up within hours. Been hear before with no problem, but will never be going back. The severe chills and living on the toilet isn't something I'd like to risk again. You can guess where I sit as I write this. And yes, this was the only place I ate that day.

My mom who also had the Salmon Teriyaki had some mild issues, but nowhere the same as me.

Sorry to all the fans."}
{"text":"Used to be a great neighborhood spot with consistent service and friendly staff. New ownership completed a much-needed remodel, but at the expense of good employees. Hard to recognize staff as there is consistent turnover. We arrived at 6pm, were seated immediately, and waited at our table (next to the hostess stand) for 20 mins without being acknowledged before walking out last visit. Total crapshoot."}
{"text":"This is truly the most overpriced horrible food you will find in Arizona (maybe the U.S).  The food is cold, small portions, over fried food, and the waiters are idiots and you never see them once you order.  I'm not sure I would call this a restaurant - maybe it's a tax shelter for the owner.  I'm not sure why people are spending money at this place when they can go to a real restaurant like Local Bistro or Becketts Table.   Do Not go to this place -save your money and go get a real meal from real chefs  (vs. landscapers they must have picked up to work in this kitchen) !"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday evening with my parents and we had a great dinner!! Our waitress was awesome and made sure we had a great time there. Highly recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"Have been there a couple of times. Food is good. Service is always slow. Last time we were there my husbands salad had an ant crawling around. I was very disappointed that no one came over to apologize nor did they offer to discount or comp it. Not cool."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you are looking for great food, great drinks without the fluff and the fluffy prices.  I had the baby back ribs with steak fries and corn for $15 awesome.  There is a kids menu and both of my kids had the chicken fingers and fries that they ate all of, so they got a $3 scoop of ice cream.  My wife had the soup and caprese salad, which she enjoyed almost as much as my ribs.  Good open air atmosphere and the nba game.  Fun time."}
{"text":"I had a burger for lunch. It was excellent. Perfectly done to order, I was very satisfied. The onion rings, like their ketchup, is Sysco, and it shows. I wouldn't recommend the onion rings. 

The breakfasts look tasty, and I look forward to coming here again to try it out. When I do, I'll bring my own ketchup ;-)"}
{"text":"Very good service and food - would never hesitate to go back when in that area.  Large patio with misters for the hot weather, too."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.  The quality of the food is what you'd expect from a $20-50 per person with a $8-13 price tag.  The service is like being at home. We've had about 8 items on the menu and all have been excellent. This is one of the best meals I've ever had for a unbelievable price!  If you like Lobster Bisque soup, you must try theirs."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant. It was a little difficult to find, hidden in an area you wouldn't expect a restaurant. But it was very cute and well laid out. Very nice patio. But absolutely amazing menu. Unfortunately the service is very disorganized. No one seem to know what the other was doing. They kept changing servers at our table. One of them apologize that it took over 15 minutes to get our drink order. Staff kept coming by and asking if we'd been helped. We would tell them know. And they would leave! With a good restaurant manager, and someone to get them organized, it could be a berry it could be successful."}
{"text":"This guy buys the cheapest wine.....regardless of request to change..making money, serving vinegar for wine...."}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for a good option in the area after hiking. Upscale interior and bar, but casual enough for lunch in post hike clothes. Large patio with heaters. Large menu with several options for sides and salad. My bbq burger was yummy and perfectly cooked. Very nice and attentive staff. Will return."}
{"text":"Our first visit for lunch. We loved the sweet potato fries!! Dawn, our server was very friendly. The burgers, Cobb salad and sandwiches were all great. The lobster bisque soup wasn't as good as we expected which is why this was not a five star rating. We will be back for burgers."}
{"text":"USE TO BE A FAVORITE OF OUR BUT NO MORE !

We are yr rounders and like supporting local places.  Especially when the snowbirds leave but I guess it doesn't matter to some restaurants.  We have left messages with concerns about their declining or unprofessional service but no response.  I guess Pinnacle Grill thinks all is good - at least while the Snowbirds are here !

Now we eat later in the evening so maybe this is after the main management leaves but my wife put it best a couple weeks ago when she said the restaurant:  THE RESTAURANT APPEARS TO BE MANAGED BY A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS !

Wait staff (not even our own) hovering over our table to pick up the paid check, no water service after the bill was paid, and one of the waiters bringing out the noisy vacuum right behind our booth as we were \"Trying\" to talk.  When I mentioned something to him about how noisy he was, he looked at me like he had no clue what I was talking about.

So I HOPE the management had left and this is not how the restaurant operated when the seasoned management is in the house.

But then again, I won't know because they haven't responded to any of our other comments."}
{"text":"Had been here when newly opened and not impressed with ribs.  Tried again on Thursday since reviews were good and I was craving steak with gorgonzola.  My son had the nachos.  We did not finish either as they were not good.  My son said the chili on nachos tasted canned and my med rare steak was well done and bland.  Too bad..."}
{"text":"I had just finished the Pinnacle Peak hike and was hungry tired and thirsty.  There were some flyers at the trail head for the Pinnacle Grill that offered a discount. I decided to give the place a try.
My hamburger was absolutely superb.  The bun was very fresh (Perhaps they make them there) The large angus patty was cooked to the medium rare I ordered, and the side salad was large and had a nice variety of greens and other salad ingredients.The service was superb.  The meal was appropriately priced.  I am not from Arizona, but would definitely return to this place."}
{"text":"We used to frequent this place when it was BluBurger. I am really pleased with the expanded menu and happy that they still have their yummy burgers and delicious sweet potato fries.

We enjoyed a wonderful night on their patio and I had the hummus plate and the lobster bisque.  The soup was outstanding, however, a little on the salty side to the point where I could use a diuretic this morning. ;o)  The hummus was really good and they give you a huge portion.

I'd definitely head back here to try some of their other soups and the salads that they've added to the menu. They also have a really good beer and wine selection as well."}
{"text":"It's really nice having a restaurant so close to home  that is very consistent with their service and food. It's recently reopened after a remodel, and it has ambiance now as well."}
{"text":"Always enjoy going to Pinnacle Grille. Nice environment and a major plus, it's close to my house AND they welcome dogs! Very broad and wide selection on the food, however I always find myself with my two favorite, the Grilled Cheese and Chicken and Rice soup."}
{"text":"Well Larry you did not take care of the Meal.  You deducted $18.00 without even our 10% resident discount!  REALLY LARRY. Do you think I need your $18?  You knew who we were because Dawn had advised you of our conversation. REALLY LARRY?  You came by and acknowledged there was a problem and that you would be back to rectify it.  REALLY LARRY?  Where did you go? How RUDE of you.. Obviously it seems you could care less of your patrons and seems like you are letting your business slip away. REALLY LARRY?  To top it off, your guitar player who was advertised to start at 8:30, was from what I was told at 8:50, was still having his dinner!  SHAME on you LARRY. As you know restaurants struggle in Arizona in the summer and barely survive.  You would think that you would go out of your way to make sure all is perfect. We felt your place was a good meeting place for the entire Troon North Association.  The Association will now find another place!  REALLY LARRY?  You have become disconnected and should think about selling out to a real restauranteur.  Wonder if your entertainment took place or did he decide to have dessert?  REALLY LARRY are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Great dog friendly patio and the food is solid for the price point. Like their fries :)"}
{"text":"We've been eating at Pinnacle Grill since we started visiting the area several years ago.  I love their variety of sandwiches and salads.  Today I had the salmon with goat cheese sandwich and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Food: only ok. Some not good. All overpriced. Bar menu sucks. Cold beer thought. I've now tried at least 3 different entr√©es and pretty much the whole happy hour menu. Service is hard core so so. Can't recommend. It's a shame they are one of the only spots around this area"}
{"text":"Ran out to sit at the bar and have dinner.  A quick bite.....not a chance.  We met many folks around us and had a great meal as usual.  The place is really hopping and remodel looks great.  Ended up being there 4 hours!!  Haven't been out in awhile so it was especially nice. 2-24-17.

{"text":"I am SO glad a friend put me on to this place.. The atmosphere is very relaxing but classy, reminds me of Europe. The service is exemplary.. and most importantly, the food is awesome. The liver and bacon is the best I've experienced in the US, the ribs are great, the steak is excellent.. The creme brulee was a little sweet for my palate, but still REALLY good (better than Ruth's Chris IMO), the Italian lemon cream cake is absolutely sublime! I'm not generally into sweets, but it's absolutely amazing. The bread pudding is excellent also (and I'm a Londoner, so I know). Oh, and appetizers! The wings are the best I've had anywhere, period. Crisp and tasty crust on the outside, moist and perfectly cooked on the inside, and with plenty of meat on them.. and probably the topper, ALL of this comes at VERY reasonable prices, especially during happy hour. HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"A group (6) of us went for lunch today to celebrate my birthday. Perfect day for patio seating, which they had ample tables available.  Server was very attentive and friendly. 

Looking through the diverse menu I see lots of options that sound great. Great options of soup, salad, entrees, sandwiches and burgers. I settle for a cup of the Crab corn chowder which was very good. Extra points for serving oyster crackers with the soup as many do not. The chowder was the right consistency of thickness. 

I opted for the build a burger option. There are diverse options to make your burger from buns, traditional toppings, or special toppings like a portabella cap, roasted chile, etc.

My burger was a ciabatta Kobe burger with pepper jack, roasted chile, guac, spinach and chipotle aioli. Once I got the burger which looked awesome, I cut it in half and noticed the patty was thin. Maybe a 1/4lb and it had a very uniform circular shape as is if it came from a frozen pack.  I told myself that they probably had a press back there and to proceed. The guac looked a darker brown than usual as if it had been out or wasn't freshly made. They had avocados on the menu so I assumed it was fresh. The bun was grilled, spinach super fresh drenched in some cheese and a chiles. 

First bite was good and got a bit of everything but something was off. After dissecting a bit the guac definitely tasted as if it came out a package and the Kobe was a frozen hockey puck. Upon examining the grilled results of the Kobe it resembles more I a black bean veggie patty, which I made sure no one else at the table had ordered.  

For a place that's supposed to be a burger joint this is an extreme disappointment. I can get a burger at a better price that's handmade and way more fresh. Cutting corners and costs on guac when you have fresh avocados is not very endearing either. 

The rest of the entrees that came out for our table looked great (chef salad, BLTA) but if I return to this location it won't be for a burger again.

{"text":"Such an awesome spot and a great bartender Brittany.  Be sure to put on your list!  Atmosphere, noise level, food quality ... all thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Everything is made from scratch & wide selection. The Ribs could win an award in KC. Also try the bread pudding."}
{"text":"Beautiful location with mountains all around. Not cheap but the food was very good. I had grilled salmon on an onion roll with lettuce and goat cheese and a few other things with a side of sweet potato fries ( I have had better sweet potato fries) washed down with a couple Fat Tires ($5 each, not bad). My wife had a grilled chicken salad with spring mix and pears grape tomatoes and goat cheese with a raspberry vinaigrette, she loved it. If you are in the area it's a good lunch. They have an outdoor, dog-friendly patio."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar, both ordered the chopped steak.
We would not order again - too goopy which disguises the meat.  Will try something different next time.  Very extensive menu.  We did not catch his name, but the bartender was someone I would hire for my business in a minute. He elevated the stars to four."}
{"text":"Everyone knows this place is the best. They remodeled and now it's much nicer and an updated ambience. Great selection and all GREAT. We return whenever possible."}
{"text":"I come here at least twice a week for the last four months.  I've never had a bad meal or bad service whatsoever.
I've tried many different entrees as well.  Cant go wrong 

My most favorite restaurant in the Verde Valley!"}
{"text":"My mom has word food poisoning ever from this place ... I just called restaurant to see if they had anyone else call in sick as there is a major E. coli outbreak.. they were so stupid and so rude and didn't even apologize.. I can't believe how dumb the manager sounded on the phone! Don't support such a terrible establishment.. stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. But the food is pretty good. We sat at our table for a good 15 minutes and no one even came over to offer us a drink. We eventually walked out because of it. There were 3 other tables around us that had the same issue. Restaurant was half empty so it's pretty unexplainable"}
{"text":"Great food ... Happy hour 3-6 .. food and drinks .. must try's include the flatbread and the meatballs .. tasty kale and strawberry, goat cheese salad .."}
{"text":"The service has really gone downhill...even simple requests are ignored and actually argued with. This is not the memory I had of the before renovation \"Pinnacle Grille.\" where service was once very good even sometimes excellent. I was so turned off by today's visit that I very likely won't return. You've been warned...."}
{"text":"This place was great came here in the evening during our stay in scotts dale. We at in the patio very nice beautiful light and great food. We started of with Kalahari which was fantastic not to salty just perfect. I built my own pasta entree with shrimp which was great my girlfriend had shrimp risotto which was very well made."}
{"text":"Always great!  Great service and yummy vegetarian options. One of the best veggie burgers around. 
Josh is an awesome server!"}
{"text":"We have given this place several chances since they remodeled. This will be my last time here!  Went with a friend for lunch. We both ordered the chicken strips. When we were served three small strips with a couple of pieces of lettuce. Mine were way over cooked and looked horrible. We asked about the sauces that were on menu & were told that is a mistake on the menu!  I sent mine back & they reluctantly agreed to bring my friend some sauces. I re ordered something else which by the time it was served my friend was done & we were running out of time. The servers were rude & clearly not interested in serving us. We are year round residents & the way they treat locals they are gonna be suffering this summer. 
Also in the evenings they make you feel like a criminal if you didn't make reservations. Then all of the reserved tables are empty!!  
Bunch of very young rude hostesses up front. 
I will gladly spend my $ elsewhere and encourage you to do the same!"}
{"text":"The customer service was horrible. The host did not pay any attention to us. The waitress could care less about our table and just brought the food out and left. I wanted dessert but she just handed us the check without even asking us and went to talk to her coworkers. No wonder this place is almost always empty. Although the food is pretty good I don't know if its worth the awful costumer service."}
{"text":"For the most part the menu is divided into three sections; appetizers, soups and salads, and burgers and sandwiches. This is not your average burger joint however! The choices are enormous for all of the categories and if that was not enough the burger section is truly build your own from the type of burger (13 types to choose from including non-meat selections), 8 kinds of buns, cheese, toppings, sauces, and more.

Fortunately they do offer prebuilt selections as well and I went for the Pinnacle Salmon burger which turned out to be the most amazing salmon burger I have ever tasted -- period. Before the burger I had a cup of the Kickin' Crab Corn Chowder which was wonderful -- but a cup? What they call a cup would be a bowl in any place I am used to.

In general the portions are very large considering the prices and our table over ordered selecting a couple of appetizers to try as well. The Chips & Guacamole are very good, the Tomato & Mozzarella is outstanding, and the Pinnacle Fries are awesome.

It seems that most places that try to be incredibly flexible with their menus and are generous with their portions compromise somewhere on quality to get there. The Pinnacle Grill, however, seems to be an exception where quality, flexibility, and quantity come together in a truly amazing combination. If you are anywhere in the area do make this a stop - you will certainly be glad you did."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service!.. I called in for pick up and talked to one of the ladies working there. I made an order and didn't even asked about what I like about my side orders, that's one! Second! When I picked up my food I asked her again if you have my two side order? And she said yes. But, wheeling I arrived home I have only one side orders instead of two! What a horrible restaurant with horrible people working in the front desk and answering orders!.. never would I come back again!"}
{"text":"They just cannot seem to get it right 
I had been there before the restaurant was renovated and I must stay the food and service were pretty good.
The decor though was nothing great.
Now the restaurant looks great and the food and service are terrible
Do you self a favour eat elsewhere"}
{"text":"Went with my daughter for dinner on a Wednesday and the place was very busy. We started with the pretzel sticks with cheddar cheese dip which were good while they were hot, then they got hard and dry so the last, third one was not worth eating. We both had \"build your own\" grilled chicken salad with the balsamic vinaigrette dressing and they were very large we added red onions, mushrooms, mozzarella cheese, quinoa, walnuts and craisens. The salad came with a very large portion of chicken breast. We also ordered the sweet potato fries which were good, very crispy. Service was good they checked on us multiple times to see if we needed anything. We will return again."}
{"text":"Hostess: Unfriendly, unwelcoming upon entering, we awkwardly waited for her to acknowledge us, then when she finally did, she only said sit anywhere. Not \"please have a seat anywhere\" just \" sit anywhere\". Scottsdale snob stereotypical.

Service/waitress: Excellent service from Maryanne. She made up for the poor first impression lack of greeting by the hostess. Maryanne was very helpful, patient, and friendly. We overheard the other waitress and she was the same, friendly, and helpful. 

Food: Get the salmon entree. I got it default medium, just barely cooked inside, and it was so moist and tender. One of best cooked salmon I've ever had.

Onion rings super, get ranch dressing.

Guacamole, delicious.

5 stars, even with the grumpy hostess. Maybe she just broke up with her s.o. or something. Regardless, she should put on a happy face at work or call in sick."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a hike on Pinnacle due to its proximity. The food here is just not that good. 

I ordered a small stack of buckwheat pancakes. The pancakes were Luke warm and tough. The thing that gets me is that you shell out a decent amount of money, yet the butter comes in little foil wraps. I HATE THAT! I might as well bring my own stick of butter if I wanted to spend 15 minutes opening little packets. I expect that at a La Quinta downstairs  crappy included breakfast, not here. Plus, the butter was cold so as I spread it, it destroyed the pancakes.

Wife got a \"meh\" omelette. Again, luke warm. The side of tomatoes were unripe and tasteless. Her turkey sausage patties were cold, hard, and obviously previously frozen and reheated. 

Overall, the Pinnacle Grill was uninspiring, disappointing, and blah."}
