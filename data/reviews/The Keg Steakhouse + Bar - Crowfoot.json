{"text":"Beware of wait times during prime dinner hours. If they tell you 45 min, be prepared to wait over an hour. Even the 'couple minutes to clean the table' turned into 15 minutes.

Service inside was just as slow, but the floor manager did comp our desserts.

Two out of three steaks were incorrect doneness and tuna tartar was under seasoned. Rest of meal was three star solid.

If you're a party of two and don't mind sitting at the bar, you might have better luck with wait times."}
{"text":"Went to this location with my family for early birthday dinner - 6 adults and 2 children.  We had attempted going once before but without a reservation, we were not eager to spend 45 minutes waiting for a table. However, the restaurant was brand new at the time.

From the Atlantic provinces, my standards for seafood are quite high. I was taking a risk by ordering the steak with scallops, shrimp and lobster claw. None of these were over or undercooked, so that was pleasing! I ordered my steak medium well, as in the past at other locations ordering a medium steak has resulted in something too bloody and red for my liking.  The steak was well cooked, pink in the centre, not tough at all. I was far more impressed than on a previous visit to the Keg in downtown Calgary.   The twice-baked potatoes are yummy and creamy and not a crumb was left by anyone who ordered them. My sister-in-law's spinach salad side also looked very good.   We also like that they offer a kid's menu, with a picky 5-year old in the family!

All the adults enjoyed their cocktails as well.  The server was very friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. When we left the lobby was bustling with people waiting for a table. I can see why. It's nice to get a better restaurant selection nearby for those of us who live \"up north.\" I will certainly go back for family dinners, but with my husband will probably stick to trying out things that are new and popular."}
{"text":"Wife and I had another wonderful experience here.  As usual we received excellent and friendly service from our server and the food was on par as usual. But what impressed us the most this time was how they handled their mistakes.  

I had ordered my steak medium-rare and it came to me way overcooked.  I notified our server and she apologized and took it back immediately to get me a properly cooked one.  What was a very pleasant surprise was the Dining Manager Jason came to our table to personally apologize for  the mistake and took the item off the bill.

This service was totally above and beyond what we were expecting and why we continue to come to this location."}
{"text":"Long time Kegger- bar bills at stadium keg while at university of calgary paid for renos. Anyhow,  size of bar very disappointing. That being said, dead of winter, unable to enjoy what appears to be fantastic patio which was built in lieu of bar space. Arrived at 4 pm, parking a disaster!! Two couples there for the full meal deal- drinks, apps, and entrees. Ordered keg size vodka tonics delivered, ask for another, one regs. Tonic on the first two-flat, no big deal as it was in sidecar. Apps good, three out of four steaks cooked reasonably as ordered, one- not close. We did our own switcheroo. Waitress was great! Upon leaving noticed valet now set up so asked if there was a fee or gratuity, the valet said free (so gratuity) it was cold so i will only call valet rude- not a dick.  Overall, as rating says, have had better experiences. I am sure they will start firing on all cylinders in the new year..."}
{"text":"This place is really nice, the ambiance is great. It might be a bit to dark inside but you adjust. The steak is to die for and their wine menu is also pretty good. And for my chicken lovers the Thai chicken is superb. It's my default go to place for steak. Great staff as well."}
{"text":"The food and service are great at this location.  The atmosphere is like eating in a cave, the interior is black on black - there is nothing interesting to gaze at on the walls.  The interior designer here failed horribly.  This location is trying to appear high class, but it is just a facade.  If you want a good meal for a good price I recommend it.  But if you don't enjoy eating in the dark with nothing to look at then I would pass."}
{"text":"The place to have steak. We go here often and have never had a bad meal. It can get busy on weekends, but the lounge is first come first serve and has the same menu."}
{"text":"Tried The Keg, in two provinces (Vancouver BC, and Calgary AB). In both locations the services was friendly, especially at this Keg location. My server was attentive, regularly coming over to check on my needs and if I was satisfied with my foods. For appetizer I ordered the escargot, calamari, shrimp cocktail. The escargot was buttery, and the shrimps were extra large!! The calamari was over cooked but had a nice sweet chili type of dipping sauce. I ordered the prime rib/lobster dinner. The prime rib was good but not the best. However my lobster tail was over cooked and dry. And lastly, I had creme brûlée for dessert. The caramelizing sugar on top was kind of wet and uneven. Some parts were thin with very little caramelization, while other parts had a typical sugar coating crunch. The creme brûlée custard was okay too. All-in-all the keg is a mediocre restaurant with good service and ambiance, but the food is over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"My beautiful girlfriend took me here for my birthday and, believe it or not, I had never been to the Keg prior to this experience. We started the night off with Bacon wrapped scallops with a martini cocktail sauce. If the scallops were cooked just a few seconds less they would have been perfect, but otherwise they were very tasty. Along with the scallops we ordered some Garlic Cheese Toast so we opted to skip the complementary bread. My girlfriend loves crusty breads and when you add Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Parmesan and Garlic to it you can't go wrong! For our entrees my girlfriend got the Teriyaki Sirloin. I don't typically marinate my steaks, but her steak had some great flavours. As for me, I went with the naturally grilled Top Sirloin (medium-rare) and Atlantic lobster tail. The steak was very tasty, but not unlike our scallops, my lobster tail could have been cooked a few seconds less. Despite a few hiccups with the cooking of the seafood, we had a pleasant experience here and we wouldn't hesitate to come back!"}
{"text":"What a great place to go!  The customer service at this particular location is impeccable.  I have yet to order food(only been to the lounge for drinks).  The patio is an extremely nice atmospher and well worth a visit in the summer months."}
{"text":"Attentive service while sitting at the bar. Awesome server who really knew his menu. I like that the fact that staff knows the gluten free items and also are not afraid to explain why the service is always inconsistent and slow in the dining room. Keg pays poorly, trains even worse yet expects star servers and kitchen staff. Hmmm sad really."}
{"text":"We went the yesterday.   We started with the mushrooms Neptune and the escargot.   We can not go to the keg with out ordering the mushrooms Neptune.   I had their spinach salad, my husband had the creole filet special and kids had the mini burger off the kids menu.   We all really enjoyed our dinner.   My husbands steak and seafood was cooked to perfection.   Great service. The only down side to this new restaurant is the parking."}
{"text":"We loved the keg so much last time we came back today but it was a completely different restaurant the second time. It wasn't their fault but they seated us in a corner where it was dark and claustrophobic. The waitress wore so much perfume you could smell her down the street...not a good start. We asked for napkins and it took 20 minutes before my we got it. When asked for more complimentary bread, Erin (I think that was her name) our waitress acted like we were criminals and said there wasn't any more..Part of the draw for us was the delicious bread and great service...We were there as it was opening so it wasn't very busy, I was confused why it took our waitress so long to get us anything we asked for.  Then when our steak came we had ordered peppercorn sauce but it didn't come. When it did our steak was cold. One would think they charge extra for peppercorn sauce that it would at least be a significant amount and hot..none  of the above occurred....Worst meal experience ever. The claustrophobia got so bad I had to leave as I was becoming nauseas. My husband paid the bill as I ran out to the light...sadly what followed me was the stench of the waitresses super strong  perfume. Compared to my last raving review I am truly  sad to say I likely will not come back, the waitress was horrible and if you are going to be rude about giving is more bread then I can buy some at a bakery and not get attitude. There isn't a rating of zero so I am forced to give 1 but that's overly generous. It's hit and miss and take your chances at the Keg. I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"Had excellent service and food. If you're going to eat here on a Saturday night, get reservations. Otherwise it will be packed."}
{"text":"Mini surf and turf, looks good. Cole slaw is a little bitter tho. And it seemed to take awhile to show up. But overall ok"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i came here tonight for a late valentines dinner. Our server was Nolan and wow was he ever incredible. The best server I've ever had at any restaurant ever. My boyfriend agreed, he made the whole amazing dinner so much better with his great sense of humour and outgoing personality. We ordered a 30 ounce rib eye steak to share, with two potato sides and their signature veggies. Got a great little brownie dessert. Paid with a gift card we got for xmas and gave him an additional tip on debit because we felt he went above and beyond our expectations of service. will definitely be back soon to this location."}
{"text":"I went for dinner tonight with my family, there were four of us in total. Our server Mitchell was excellent from start to finish and when there was a small issue with my meal he along with his manager Nick more than addressed it (more then I would have asked for on my own). We always enjoy the food when we come and have never had complaints about the service but tonight was a STELLAR example of amazing customer service from both gentlemen. Thanks so much and we will of course be back!"}
{"text":"This is based on the fact that I usually only eat at restaurants after 7pm and I travel around Canada for a living. 

This the best Keg franchise I've been to. The service is better than most other Kegs and the kitchen staff consistently prepares more accurate dishes than other Kegs, Sawmills, Tony Romas, and Montana's I've been to in Alberta. Only four stars because at the end of the day, it's still just a Keg."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and everything was great until the server accidentally spilled a jug of pop all over my girlfriends back. She was soaked. It absolutely ruined our meal and experience and the manager only offered to reimburse us for dry cleaning her shirt if we brought a receipt in. He wouldn't comp the meal and so we had to pay full price and leave half way through our meal because who wants to sit and have dinner when they are drenched in pop. Just appalling management and no care for customers."}
{"text":"We were craving a steak and thought, what better place than The Keg for our craving?

The Keg is located in Crowfoot right by the movie theater, Shanks and Tony Romos. A fairly large parking lot, however since it was peak dinner time hours, it was a bit full however after one loop in the parking lot, found a nice  and close spot. 

When entering The Keg restaurant, its modern, beautiful decor and smelled delicious. We arrived and since it was dinner time, it was a bit  busy. We  walked in and were greeted by a bubbly hostess. We were advised it would be a 10-15 minute wait however were welcome to go in the bar for a beverage and were given a pager to let us know when our table was ready. 

Side note - our table was ready quiet quick. As soon as we ordered a beverage in the bar, our table was ready. Great thing, you can bring your beverage to the restaurant.

We were seated in a nice spot in the middle of the restaurant. Our waiter was prompt and let us know  the specials as well as he would be back since it was obvious we didn't need beverages yet since we hadn't even had a sip of ours from the bar. We looked over the menu and since we were on the \"prowl for meat\", we made a quick decision. 

Appie/Starter: Calamari.
Entrée's: 1 surf and turf (lobster + NY steak) and 1 prime rib (10 oz.). 
Dessert: Billy Miners Pie
Bevies: Wine + Beer (a few during and pre- dinner)


Everything was delicious from start to finish. The food tasted fantastic and the presentation of everything was perfect. Steak and Prime rib were done to perfection. The pie was huge and so glad we shared it because there  was no way I would be able to finish it. I don't usually order a dessert like this, since I am a cheesecake or/and a chocolate cake kind of girl but the pie was a great surprise. So good!

They also have a great patio in front, which I will have to check out on a nice YYC day. Staff was very friendly (Hostess + waiter), prices reasonable for a steakhouse and the restaurant is gorgeously decorated.

Will be back since there is so many other items I want to try on this menu, need to check out the patio and love the atmosphere at this Keg."}
{"text":"Steak is always cooked perfectly and the escargot is fantastic.  My 6 year old son loves to eat the steak and fries here.  Even the kids steak is really good, and cooked perfect.  It's so nice to have a good restaurant in the NW."}
{"text":"Our favourite The Keg (Lower Mount Royal) closed its doors forever almost 2 years ago. We have been exploring the other Calgary locations ever since.
Went for our anniversary dinner on a weekday. We both had to work the following day so we arrived right when the restaurant opened - 4 P.M.
Very welcoming staff, beautiful decor, comfortable booth.
We ordered the Sirloin 'Oscar' (it has scallops and shrimp in a Bearnaise sauce), garlic mashed potatoes and veggies.  Medium rare steak was cooked to perfection.
Our server was very professional and friendly.

Cons....the ambient is a little too dark for my liking. I would also like a little more veggies on the plate and more sauce as well.

We are definitely going to come back to this location."}
{"text":"Party of 4 came to The keg for steaks. Ordered Fillet mignon, sirloin, New York and half lobster( seasonal menu, very fresh), and keg size(2 oz) blended margarita. Onion soup is onion, cheese, breads,no meat inside.. All steaks are super duper good! came with a side of twice baked potato. The cheese of Caesar salad is very good too. We arrived at 7pm and waited about 15mins to get a table(good), and the service is really good too."}
{"text":"After meeting up at the Legion for International Tabletop Day and playing a few rounds of Coup,  the event closed down leaving D and I to pick what was for dinner.  I suggested that as we were both starving and I had a pair of gift cards taking up space in my purse we should go to the Keg.  Finally.  I've had one gift card since probably 2005-2006.  We agreed and had an interesting time driving to Crowfoot (a perfectly sized Focus decided to block my view of his car so at one point I had no idea if I was going the right way)...

As it was a Saturday the movie theatre customers had taken up the vast majority of parking, but we managed to find a pair of spots between the Keg and the Chapters.   We went in and the wait was 30 minutes but we weren't in that big a hurry (really it ended up being more like 15-20).  First impressions were that we were seriously underdressed and I thought I should have kept my work shirt on as at least that was better suited to the upscale atmosphere than our jeans, gamer shirts, and hoodies.  Nobody treated us like we were out of place though and that was very much appreciated.  At the end of the meal our server even joked that we'd have been okay in PJ's (we would never do that though - I saw that once at Felicos in Richmond, BC and was completely appalled by the sight).

We were seated in a nice quiet back booth where we could hold a conversation without having to raise our voices, and proceeded to review the menu and winelist.  To start we shared a scallops and bacon appetizer and the complementary bread.  The bread came first and was so warm it was difficult to break pieces off without overheating fingertips, which is exactly how we like it.  The butter was perfectly whipped so that it just melted into all the fluffy pockets of the bread and tasted delicious.  The scallops and bacon were perfectly cooked.  Unlike the last time I had bacon-wrapped-scallops, the bacon wasn't overcooked which meant the scallops were tough.  The Keg did it perfectly - tender scallops with slightly crisped bacon and a great cocktail sauce dip.  Those disappeared fast.

With the main course we each had a glass of the Malbec, a flavourful smooth red with a hint of bite that worked perfectly with the steak.  For the meal we each ordered the 10oz Prime Rib special with crispy onions.  My side was a twice-baked potato and his was the garlic mash.  The prime rib was left as medium rare and was so close to rare that I was absolutely delighted.  I like mine pink throughout and the ring from the smoke, seasoning and baking was so think and perfect that the meat itself tasted just right.  The au jus was light and added a little bit of a different flavour but the juiciness wasn't needed due to how tender the meat was.  Honestly it was one of the best steaks I have ever had.  The crispy onions were delicious, and the twice baked potato was filled with sour cream, chives, and minced bacon - absolutely delicious.  I added a little au jus to the potato and that was really good too.

For dessert, because we saw the menu and just had to have some, D had his favourite - cheesecake with strawberry and a little chocolate sauce, and I had the creme brulee.  The cheesecake was light, rich in creamcheese flavour, and the crust was just the right amount.  I might try that next time - as one little taste definitely isn't enough.  The creme brulee was rich and creamy with a delicious simple flavour, and the topping was lovely though for my taste I usually prefer a few more seconds with the blowtorch as only a few spots cracked properly.

Our server was great, conversational and helpful.

All in all we followed each other home stuffed and content after our first really nice dinner out in the 6+ years we've been together.  For steaks like that, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really good service. Food tasted fairly clean. Would definitely come back for the steak."}
{"text":"This Keg loses a star for this evening's visit in the lounge. It really needs to step up its service to match how pretty the place is.
Moderately busy on a Wed night - no hostess at the stand, we went into the bar area ourselves and grabbed one of the last tables. The drinks took forever (glass of wine and a pint of beer) as well as the food. The appies took an hour and the waitress felt so bad about it that she took my scallops off the bill as well as my baked potato to-go. Nice, saved a star! We were told that the kitchen staff were all new. No excuse really but hey, it happens. Needless to say we were starving when the food finally arrived.
I found a long light coloured hair mashed into my butter for my bread. Nice. Fortunately, we were towards the end of our meal when that happened. Ick.
Hubby had a burger and it was his first at the Keg. Prime Rib burger, not bad! The fries were piping  hot and cooked perfectly.
The bill took forever to pay.
So, overall, the food was good but the service/kitchen timing was pretty brutal this time around."}
{"text":"Our absolute favourite place - The service is always great and the food is even better. If our food takes too long or is messed up by any chance (which rarely happens) The manager or our server always make sure to over compensate and have us leaving happy. The food is literally to die for and jordan is the best server we've ever had! Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"We always love going to this location. It has a modern, yet classy interior. The tables are dimly lighted, but you are still able to see the menu writing. They play upbeat, smooth music that is loud enough to hear, but quiet enough so you can talk to people across the table. 

When we first came in, we had to wait around 10 minutes, which honestly I didn't mind. They were apologetic, and even paid for all of our dessert.

We were seated in a booth, with a lattice pattern surrounding the booth above. The cutlery and plates were clean, as well as the table. Our server greeted us with a smile, and she also apologized about the wait. 

I had ordered the French onion soup, which was delicious. It was served on a warm plate, and was the perfect size for me. 

I also ordered the Prime Rib. It was cooked the way I ordered it, and I could see all the juices on the inside. 

For my desert, (which they paid for) I had the mango creme brûlée. It was so creamy, but I have to point out: the burnt sugar on top was a bit burnt. Other than that, it was really delicious for a (would have been) $3 dessert.

I am always happy with the experience here."}
{"text":"Meh. This place is just....meh. I find it a little overpriced and overhyped, and the service I recieved was really odd. The server was friendly and attentive, but almost to the point of being obnoxious and overfriendly. Fantastic cocktails though!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service was slow. Not the servers fault but the kitchen is slower than the sloths from Zootopia"}
{"text":"We got there, tons of parking...
Walked inside it was beautiful inside...seriously...
We were greeted professionally...
We didn't like where we were about to be seated, so I asked to change to a booth we were accommodated instantly.  
We had drinks ( my billini was ummm perfect)...
We had a Caesar salad that was so delicious....
Then I had a rib stead medium- it came perfectly done, I had the double baked potato (that they take out of the skin, mash it with butter and some other stuff- and put it back into the skin)...again so so good. 
The carrot cake that is new to the menu was crazy delicious!! 
Should have taken an extra one home. 
Seriously we did not experience any of the negative things said about this restaurant...we were lucky and happy!!

When I yelped it, we were not going to go based on previous comments, though we decided to go, as \"we\"  wanted to try it and see for ourselves if it was good or not, so we went.
I was so pleasantly surprised, it was amazing.
So, my experience,  from parking when we got there- to walking out was a fantastic!!
This too is on our list- as a go to!!
Everything was truly delicious worthy of 5 stars. 
However... $$$ !! 
Ehhh - sometimes the old adage- you get what you pay for,  is true!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is extremely dark, which when you come in from the bright sunshine can take a few minutes to adjust to. My husband and I came early on a Tuesday evening, before the rush, without a reservation and initially were going to be seated at the darkest spot in the restaurant. It was in a small enclosed area with absolutely no natural light. We immediately asked for a different table and were accommodated. That was the only blip in the experience. Our young male server was excellent and the food as usual was very good and the portions generous. You really can't go wrong ordering any type of beef at The Keg."}
{"text":"This is a nice keg! We had to kill some time and we went into the lounge. It's gorgeous! First time going to the keg and NOT ordering steaks. We got their specialty happy hour cocktail the New York sour. Awesome presentation. I'm not a fan of whiskey but it was good. Happy hour also had Robert mondavi Cabernet 6oz for $6. Good deal. We got sliders, mushrooms Neptune and I got the blue cheese wedge salad. Ugh so good. I love stinky cheese. 

Waitress was superb! Nice Friday happy hour :)"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant!!!   The manager is amazing and the service is exemplary!  Beautiful decor.   Everything appears to have improved over the last two years. 

While everyone is increasing prices and \"modifying\" their menu, the Keg is keeping consistent and even beginning to improve.

Been here 3 times over the last month.   Everything has been perfect.  Dietary concerns acknowledged and food quality maintained.   Great food from the nachos to the steak.

If I could, would nominate this location for an award.  Keep up the good work!!!  

PS  There is only one downside.  If you are going on a colder day, bring a coat/sweater.   They keep the restaurant rather cool."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night. Their booth was not exactly comfortable as the seats are unbalanced--one side high and the other side really low. Jericho, our server, is really attentive and patient. 

We began with baked Brie which was fantastic. We also ordered bacon wrapped scallops. The scallops were big and bacon quite crunchy. However, I found it a bit oily. 

We each ordered a steak entree. My prime rib was absolutely fabulous. Dad got the king crab and bro got the lobsters. The king crab was quite fresh and meaty and the lobsters looked pretty and tasted awesome. However, the amount and price do not seem comparable. Moms order of the special menu came with chewy steak full of tendon which made it hard to eat. The twice baked potato was amazingly flavorful. 

Even the deserts were just amazingly tasty. Overall, it was a fantastic night with great food. I will be back again!!"}
{"text":"The ambience was great; staff very welcoming; our waiter was very attentive to our needs; however, we were lacking his presence at the table at times that we needed him; I understand it was a very busy night and it would not be probably his fault; he might be short handed but it's the management responsibility to ensure right amount of staffing for the busy nights.
Food was great, typical KEG Steaks; same usual quality;
The location of this KEG is great with lots of parking spots available."}
{"text":"You can never be disappointed with The Keg...it's usually a good dining experience with consistent food quality and service. They are obviously known for their great steaks such as the peppercorn steak, the New York steak or even the delicious Prime Rib. 

If you are not much or a steak person, you'll be happy with their lobster or creole chicken or ribs...lots to choose from and rarely disappointed with whatever we order. 

Sometimes you may have a long wait to be seated and service can take a bit longer but overall I would recommend eating here for any occasion."}
{"text":"While I've frequented the Keg at many different locations, it was my first time to this spot in Crowfoot. Man, I was really impressed! The design, decor, and atmosphere of the space was very classy. Clearly a lot of thought went into it. I've always had good experiences at the Keg, and this was no exception. I was here to celebrate a family birthday, and both the service and the food were great.

The service I particularly enjoyed - he sensed that it was a pretty casual birthday and was fantastic and making the right jokes and making everyone laugh while still being professional. He was prompt with check-ins, water, and food service. Plus....... he was super cute which is always a win (though not factored into the review)! 

We started with calamari and mushrooms neptune, the latter of which are an absolute treat to me - I did notice that the mushrooms were not consistently sized and several of them were quite small. Considering they are mushrooms I don't think it would be too hard to choose the larger ones! 

My favourite thing about the Keg is that the steaks are consistent. If I order a rare baseball top sirloin, I know I can expect it to be tender, juicy, and rare. Same goes for the awesome twice-baked potato and the veggies, though I must admit that the veggies are extremely boring. 

Consistency is great, but I would love it if the Keg also offered a few seasonal or rotating options to spice it up.  

At it's price point, I know that I can count on the Keg to deliver a good steak in a good atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"I have been to a few different Keg's over the years, with experiences being drastically different from very poor to amazing.

This review is specifically for the Crowfoot Crossing Keg.  We have been there probably 8 times now.  I am not sure when it was built, but it seems quite new and modern.  It is always very busy when we go, and they do not take reservations.

We get consistently great service whenever we go, very good servers, always friendly, informed on the menu and very accommodating to my fiancee's allergy issues.

The food is always good, and the steaks!  Well why else do people go to the Keg?  Mine is always cooked as I want, very flavorful, high quality beef.  

As long as you don't mind waiting as a walk in on the weekends, as it is very busy, it is well worth it."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here. Its pretty nice. I wasn't hungry but I really wanted to come here for drinks and appies. So we got calamari, scallop and bacon and the tuna tartare. The calamari was a bit soggy amd others were pretty good. 

The service was awesome here. Overall, I liked the food here and definitely will come again."}
{"text":"Worst meal in recent memory. Medium = well done. Ghost of a waitress. Wrong kids meal took 15 minutes to replace. No drink refills. 

However, the manager was very apologetic and reflected it in the final bill. 

May or may not be back."}
{"text":"Coming off of a poor experience with hostesses at this place, I contacted a manager, who set me up with a reservation and was extremely apologetic. 
We used our reservation with my husband and mother-in-law. All of us ordered steak, all of which were cooked perfectly. I like their wine menu, and they have a great variety of other drinks. 
I cannot emphasize enough how well the cooks on the steaks are. After having multiple disappointing experiences at other restaurants I now NEVER order a steak from anywhere else. I always thought of the Keg as somewhere expensive for a treat - but if you compare to the bills from some of these other places that couldn't cook a steak to save their life, you aren't paying that much more to get a much higher quality of meal. 
The parking here however is a nightmare - not much the restaurant can do about that though. 
We will be back, and will will be bringing an appetite."}
{"text":"Went to dinner for a girls night with 4 of us to celebrate a birthday.  We were hesitant to come as last time we went (over a year ago) was not a good experience due to horrible service & low quality food. This time we were not disappointed. We were impressed that the Master Chef came out personally to speak to us regarding an allergy one of us had to make sure to avoid any allergic reactions. On top of that, our waitress Sara B (Ariel) was amazing & the food was delicious. AND we shared Billy Miner Pie for dessert on the house for a birthday dessert. It was to die for!"}
{"text":"For dinner last night we decided to head over to The Keg in Crowfoot. I was surprised they take reservations now which should help with the abnormally long waits. It was nice to arrive and be seated immediately. 

We both had the 6 oz top sirloin with roasted vegetables and asparagus as the side. The steak was done to perfection and the vegetables were excellent. Ordered a side of roasted mushrooms and man they were good. Started the meal off with a glass of bubbly and then moved into wine for dinner. Overall a really good meal and very good service. 

The Keg does value right. We commented why go downtown when we can come here, right close to home. The feel is professional without being pretentious, just how we like it. 

If you are looking for a good steak dinner you can't beat The Keg."}
{"text":"The keg is always amazing! Food is perfect and customer service always on point. Even if their busy everything seems to still run smoothly. Great for a night out !"}
{"text":"This one is tough. I wish I could rate the food and the service separately. We went to this location on Saturday. We have been trying to get into this place for a few years now. We complained and were able to get a reservation. 

The reservation was for 7PM. We showed up 15 minutes early and were told that our table was just being cleaned off and would be ready for 7PM. 

at 7:05 I checked in again to make sure everything was on track. I was told again that our table was being cleaned and should be ready any minute. 

at 7:20 I went back and was told the exact same thing? Table is being cleaned and should be ready any minute. 

at 7:30 we FINALLY sat down and were told a manager would be seeing us to make sure we were happy. 

the waitress came quickly too our table and told us she would be right back to take our drink orders... after about 15 minutes she FINALLY returned to our table to take our drink orders. when we asked her about the service we were experiencing she told us it wasn't her fault. 

once the manager showed up and we told him what was going on our service experience changed. 

The food was amazing as always. perfectly cooked. very tasty. but if you know me, i am a stickler for service. 

I don't think I will return to this location."}
{"text":"Tonight was a busy night, but in the past that hadn't stopped the food from being delicious. When this Keg first opened the food was exceptional. It seems every time I return the experience becomes less inviting. Tonight, after slow service, I finally received my sirloin Oscar. The steak portion was long and skinny, half grizzle. (Usually it's plump and round) The 2 shrimp were over cooked, hard, dry, and half the size they normally are. The 1 scallop was hard and tasteless. The vegetables were undercooked and tasted like old boiled water. The twice baked potato was cool, but good. After all it does have bacon in it. The sauce was barely a tablespoon spread on the meat. I think this was the most disappointing part. At least with ample sauce you can mask the other bland flavours. I am not one to complain so I half finished my meal. I did mention to the server that the steak was an odd shape and not very good. I can't remember a time when I left half my steak on the plate. The portion is small to begin with, so it had better all be good, not half grizzle. Especially for the price. I received a half sincere  apology and that was it. As the night went on I became frustrated, that I didn't make a larger complaint, so that is what I'm doing now."}
{"text":"For dinner tonight we decided to drive into the city and have the Keg. I can't say that I was disappointed with the food and based my review on that because the food was delicious, the only complaint is that the lobster was a little over cooked but not enough to make a complaint. I'm basing my review on what I witnessed while we were eating. The 2 tables beside us had finished up and left, tables were bussed and waiting to be cleaned. The waitress dropped the cloth on the floor, left it there for 10+ minutes while we finished our meals and went to do something else and then came back and continued to clean the tables after picking the cloth up off of the floor. How absolutely disgusting. Just based on that level of cleanliness I will be very unlikely to return or recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Very good... The mojitos were great!! ... And the food is very good, like in most of the keg I have been... This place will never disappoint you in any of their locations.."}
{"text":"Maybe they are too busy. Twice now in two weeks I have tried The Keg in Crowfoot and both times they have failed to bring me a steak I could eat. First time it was rare. Sent back and then when my company had finished their meals my new steak was brought out. It was cooked the way I ordered it.
Tonight I tried a steak that was advertised as a fall specialty. It was cooked to perfection! Too bad it was cold! They tried again only to bring out an improperly cooked steak. It was rare to blue.
I'm looking for a good steak in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Here's another restaurant I'm adding to my NO SALT list.  Check it out!

The Keg at Crowfoot is very accommodating especially when we voice our concern that a family member has a no salt diet restriction.  They are very careful and they come out to discuss the menu with you as to what they can adjust and make with no salt. All the times we've been to The Keg at Crowfoot have been fantastic!  The food has come out tasting really, really great even without salt!

Beef Tenderloin with Cajun Prawns - we got them to change it to Beef Tenderloin with Garlic Prawns, only with baked potato and greens cooked with no salt.  Howzat??  Still tastes great but just cooked with no salt!"}
{"text":"I love The Keg! It's one of my family's go-to restaurants. The food is fantastic! I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered and on the one occasion that I wasn't happy with something, the server immediately took care of the situation and replaced my dish. All locations that I have visited have been great but I especially like this one as it is quite new. While I generally get the Top Sirloin, there are many delicious options to choose from and the dessert options are wonderful as well (especially the brownies)!"}
{"text":"I agree with Janna on some points regarding the Crowfoot Keg:

We stopped in for a late supper yesterday around 8ish and the place is gorgeous, its fairly new and parking was an issue for us too; I didn't see any of this valet service people are speaking of in the other reviews.  We drove around for a bit until something opened up.

There were about 4 girls at the hostesses station and they were all very pleasant and one of them promptly showed us to our table.

Hubby decided on a peppercorn NY strip and I had the prime rib and for the record I have been to all Keg locations and this prime rib, although done pretty perfect was about half fat and gristle.  Knowing that this particular cut tends to be fatty, this was ridiculous, I would say at least 4-5 oz of it was pure blubber!   The rice pilaf and side veg were bland and I just used the salt on the table to try to salvage them.  Since I was starving, I ate what I could and didn't say anything, my hubby said his steak was good but a bit overdone.  All in all the food was good, and since it was our first time at this new Keg, understood that there are some kinks that need to be ironed out.  I will not be ordering the prime rib again though. -1 Star

I would like to point out that the blue cheese wedge salad was fantastic and the complementary sour dough bread with whipped butter was delicious.  We ordered the calamari to start and found they were slightly overdone but better than a lot of places, personally I would have loved the traditional tatziki instead of the overtly sweet ginger sauce it was served with (tasted like Costco sesame ginger sauce).

To finish we ordered the cheese cake, it was meh- I have had much better and took it to go for the kids.  I really wanted to try the creme brûlée but the waitress mentioned there was citrus in it and that turned me off.

After the desert was served the restaurant was virtually empty there were a couple of tables in the back but our waitress must have went on break as it took her half an hour to come back and get us our bill, this was after my husband tracked down another waiter and asked him to find ours. -1 Star

She finally came back and was apologetic and promptly brought the bill.  

Will I come back?  Ya, probably, my husband is a total carnivore and since it is reasonably close to home, a decent pick for a steak house."}
