{"text":"I love this Sushi place!
I have tried their vegetable roll wrapped with avocado, their standard salad, avocado salad and miso soup.. and all were delicious!
I am a vegetarian and sushi seeker and found their avocado-wrapped vegetable roll to be the BEST vegetable roll I've tried in T.O.
Great sized portions and delicious, fresh foods."}
{"text":"People hated this restaurant because they didn't know how to correctly order. You can get premium fishes with a decent price here. If you are the kind of guys that only know salmon or sth, you prob need to learn to appreciate other fishes."}
{"text":"Service for sushi seemed too fast - almost thought it was premade. Dinners came with handrolls, was charged $2 to just substitute to a california roll (instead of a hand california roll). I'm not a big hand roll fan.... It was ok. I'll keep looking for better sushi."}
{"text":"A slight toughie to find (for someone who is visiting there on business), but a really good find. I was super-impressed at the quality and quantity of fish that I got for an incredibly low price. Granted, maybe sushi in Canada is cheaper all over, but I thought $13 for bluefin toro was damn near free. All of it was super fresh too...I tasted no fishiness at all. 

Yeah, decor could use a bit of work, and service may be a hair slow, but if all you have is a hankerin for a lot of basic but fresh fish, this is the place to go my droogies. Easy single man dinin'. A TV (make sure to sit close to it...its tiny) and a sushi bar to keep you occupied without looking like a loser. If I lived in Toronto, I'd go here all the time."}
{"text":"I have a problem with the food being store in plastic containers like Urban Herbivore.  It is low class and not hygenic!

Sushi or other food items should be placed in glass or porcelain dishes.  

The quality of the Sashimi is standard at best.   I've been back with friends and had salmon sashimi that tasted like it had been thawed from a freezer!  

This place is advertised as authenic Japanese Sushi, but the people that work here are all Chinese."}
{"text":"This place was very pleasantly surprising. Given the proliferation of sushi shops in Toronto, we didn't expect much for this little corner run-of-the-mill sushi place. But it ended up being quite good! 

My boyfriend ordered the sashimi platter and spicy salmon roll, which had huge chunks of fish and an excellent filling-to-rice ratio. 

I ordered the chicken teriyaki bento box, and really loved the tempura (crunchy and flavourful). Even the chicken was tender and lean, and not full of fatty pieces like it usually is. 

Great place for some quick and cheap eats. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Japanese food and though I am no Iron Chef Morimoto, I do consider myself able to discern the good from the spectacular. Kyoto's cuisine lies closer to the good range. The portions are huge (see pictures) but I find the quality so-so. The fish is fresh enough (but a little slimy). The rolls were tasty but not unlike others I have had before. The sushi rice kept falling apart (a little dry perhaps??). Would I go back? I might go and try the toro that they are advertising to be in season. But I plan to head over to Taro's Fish to pick up a fresh slice anyhow ...

In the end, I would return for the lunch special but I much rather head over to Solo / Taro for a treat. Yes, I am a sushi princess that way.

FYI, the d√©cor is slightly dark and dated. But I don't care about that. I can eat squat-style if the food is good. The service is prompt but I had to call for the tea a few times."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch.  Two really positive aspects of this restaurant: 1) good prices, 2) huge portions.   My friend recommended this place, as people from her work said it was a good spot for lunch.

Part of my meal came with sushi, which was below average.  The fish was not sliced properly.  The miso soup was watery. I ordered salmon and chicken teriyaki, which were both generous portions, along with white rice and a tossed salad. Not sure what kind of dressing was on the salad, but it was fine.  The salmon and chicken were both decent.

Don't think I'll be back here."}
{"text":"With Kokyo the surprises never stop coming. And this is not necessarily a good thing. 

Each time I visit or get take-out I can never be sure if this is going to be a 1 star or a 4 star experience in terms of the quality of the fish, more evident if you are ordering sashimi.

The Pros:

- The size of their rolls are always huge
- The servers are nice and friendly
- When eating in or getting take-out the order is always ready in record time

The Cons:

- Huge variance in quality of fish
- They keep the tuna and salmon used for rolls chopped (a lot of places do), this reduces the taste/experience

Suggestions:

- When ordering any tuna or salmon roll ask them to put the seaweed on the outside, it makes it very difficult to use pre-chopped/shredded fish so you'll get  nice big chucks of fish in your rolls
- If ordering a meal, ask them to add seaweed salad to the normal house salad (a mix of the two), tastes pretty good and costs near nothing
- Ask for low sodium soy, in case you don't do so already. Does wonders for the sushi (apply to nearly all sushi joints)
- If you get take out, check if the order is correct, if they miss something and you call in, you are most likely going to be made to feel like its your mistake (the last time this happened I did not go there for over 6 month)"}
{"text":"I am a bit surprised that Kokyo has negative reviews. Maybe I can take the good with the bad. There is a sea of Japanese restaurants in downtown Toronto, so deciding on one is a chore.  Kokyo was suggested by my hotel staff and I was pleased overall. 

The restaurant was packed on a Friday night and has 80% of the seating outdoors. We were given the option to sit anywhere we wanted( only 2 options). The grate covering the subway is on the sidewalk a meter from the seating area which causes loud train noises during dinner. Also, the grate is unavoidable when entering and exiting, so ladies be mindful with your heels. 

Our waitress was very nice, but we did not receive much attention. 

I ordered the pork cutlet with katsu sauce and it was well prepared and tasty. I then had the large sashimi combination boat. It was only 32CAD for a LOT of sushi. Everything was extremely fresh! Red dragon roll followed, but didn't stand out for any reason

Concluding, I think this is a nice quality sushi restaurant. The quality and freshness of the fish makes up for drawbacks in decor and location. I would go again. 

Side note, it is a GREAT! value for sushi, but drinks are a bit over priced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Huge sushi roll. Lot of fish in the roll...i have to admit the presentation is lacking. 

Generous portion. presentation is mediocre. service is decent. Price is pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Where to begin with my absolute favorite Sushi spot in Toronto. They have high quality Sushi, the taste is perfect on all of their Maki/Sashimi (very high quality). Really, they are hard to beat, just great stuff. The presentation is good, alot better than some of the other people make it out to be on here (lacking flare etc). It's a more pragmatic presentation, focus is on the food quality/portions i'll give you that. But, honestly, i'm there to eat and it's delicious every time. Very friendly staff, lovely people - family run place. 

Really do yourself a favour and check them out."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place, nothing fancy, but it's great for the price. I usually get the bento box combo, it comes with everything and it's more than enough food for two people, for only fifteen bucks plus tax&tip."}
{"text":"Food: sometimes good, sometimes bad. Service: poor. Ambiance: poor. Price: Some good value.

Food: Sometimes, the sashimi portions and maki rolls are generous and fresh. Other times, the rolls are skimpy, with minimal rice surrounding the seaweed on a California roll, and poorly cut. The nigiri can be the width of a women's index finger or too big to eat in one bite. The sushi rice can be moist or dry and undercooked.

Basically, the food is unpredictable. Besides unpredictable, I've found a piece of wood in my chopped hamachi roll once and also gotten some bad fish that has made me ill, like Melissa F.

Service: I ate in once and takeout many times over the course of four years. I find the service meh to poor. Once, I raised an issue about them forgetting one of my nigiri sushi in a takeout order. Nothing in the way of apologies or a real method to remedy the problem that did not further inconvenience me.

Another time, I asked for 2 substitutions in a takeout sushi combo. The substitution fee was not made known to me at the time of ordering and I only raised this issue when I saw the bill was in excess of the menu price. It was $2.00 for 2 substitutions where the a la carte difference for 2 pieces was only total $0.40. Again, the money isn't so much the issue, but the service handling -- only an insistence that they were correct in charging me or they could substitute the original fish again for the original price. I have an abhorrence for wasting food or food that might be thrown away, so I paid and felt like a chump.

Overall, the food, price, ambiance, and especially, the service, combine for a poor experience. I used to keep on going to Kokyo (even forgetting about the food poisoning!), but I find the food so unevenly mediocre and the service so poor that I will remember to stay away from now on because Kokyo just makes my day usually unpleasant."}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite places to grab sushi before heading back to chicago (the land of expensive not so fresh sushi)...

at kokyo i am constantly amazed by the giant pieces of fish in the rolls, esp the california roll , which is a usually disappointing choice at sushi joints. but here the roll is filled to the brim with fresh salmon, lots of avocado and all the other good stuff. i generally order some sort of combo deal, which for under $15 gets you soup, salad, and three different rolls. all good and tasty. yes, this place is not the most creative or fusion with their rolls, but i don't want them to be. they do classics the right way. yum."}
{"text":"I used to come to this restaurant all the time because they had very good Uni handrolls which costs approx. $5-7 each  . Their service is very average. Other food on menu is also very average.
One time I was here with friends, when the bill came, it showed $10 uni handroll x 4 = $40 before tax. I asked the waitress how come the uni handrolls are now $10 a piece? 
She replied \"It was always $10 a piece\"
I said \"I came here for the uni handroll all the time and was just here few months ago and it was always about $5-7 each\"
The waitress gave us attitude and said \"NEVAAAAAAAAAA\"

My friends and I were in a rush so we paid and left. I decided to check their website and the website clearly stated uni handroll is $5.25 each!

Will never return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was adequate however the service was the worst I have received in Toronto in years. They were slow and barely served us. They were rude and sloppy. It took 20 minutes to talk to a waitress and our food came 20 minutes or more apart from other people at our table who ordered at the same time. 

I normally tip 20% for good service. When we were leaving we left a poor tip due to the terrible service. The manager tried to claim there was a minimum of 15% tip in Canada and was very rude.  She immediately ran over to a table of her friends by the door and talked trash about us and tried to intimidate us as we left. 

And now I leave my first negative review as a warning."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest fish I've had in the city! The tuna and salmon quality is phenomenal. I almost always get takeout / delivery, so I haven't had any issues with the service. The order is usually ready when I pick it up. It's not cheap, but you get so much food (and such high quality food), so it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Prices are doubled from usual sushi places. I remember when this place was Yamasaki. Buffet all you can eat and reasonable a la cart option .
So sad."}
{"text":"My friend and I were visiting Toronto this past weekend, and after a long day of walking around the city we decided to grab some sushi to snack on before heading back to the hotel to rest and get ready for proper dinner.

We settled on Kokyo after passing by a couple other restaurants. A very nice waitress greeted us at the front door and we were seated in the outdoor patio area. The plastic lawn chairs were scuffed and old looking. There was duct tape around the outer edge of all the tables. To hide chips and cracks? Who knows. 

We ordered 4 rolls: Spicy Tuna with tempura flakes; Cucumber; Salmon; and Honolulu. The prices were pretty cheap compared to the sushi place we frequent in our hometown, so we thought we were getting a deal. 

When the rolls came out my first thought was: Holy sh*t I hope we don't get food poisoning from this. I don't know if it was the chef's first day out of school or what, but they were the sloppiest looking rolls we've ever seen. They looked like they were falling apart. And the pieces were sliced so huge, it was almost impossible to eat them in one bite. You could either try to shove the whole thing in your mouth and hope you could chew it enough to swallow, or try to take two bites, which effectively destroyed the piece and made a mess. I settled on taking two bites each, dealing with the mess to avoid choking.

As for the taste, it was MEH. We are really spoiled when it comes to sushi, our local sushi place consistently puts out exceptional food. The cucumber roll was just a (huge) chunk of cuke surrounded by rice, so it's hard to go wrong there. The Honolulu roll was good, but the avocado had some brown spots on it. The Spicy Tuna roll tasted just the slightest bit off. It looked fairly unappetizing, which probably colored our opinion. I liked the texture of the tempura flakes though. The Salmon roll was also ok. We left several pieces on the plate. We just didn't want to finish them.

Thoughout dinner there was one particularly agressive fly that would not leave me alone, and little birds hopping around the patio. Not very relaxing when you're trying to eat. Overall, I would say skip this place. I'm sure you can do better."}
{"text":"Came here around 8pm on Sunday night for dinner and the restaurant was really quiet; we were one of two tables. 

Service was kind of slow considering how quiet it was. Tea wasn't served to us until order was placed. We ordered the uni hand rolls which were bomb and to be honest, I would only come here mainly for the hand rolls. We also had spotted shrimp sashimi, o-toro sashimi, and a small platter of sashimi to share. This place is definitely a good bang for your buck. 

Restaurant is a small dainty place own and run solely by a couple. They have a wide selection on their menu including some premium qualities such as different types of tuna bellies, shrimps, salmon roe, etc. 

One downfall for us is the trek to get here because it's super out of the way and we wish that they could have served us tea right when we sat down. Nonetheless, we will be back for the hand rolls!"}
{"text":"Where to sit?

It was a beautiful evening, so we had a hard time deciding on whether to sit indoors (with the vents blasting in your face) or outside (a little windy and the subway grates are not far).  We eventually chose to sit on their patio out front.  We were drawn outdoors by a perfect table against the wall that seemed to be available.  We got in trouble as soon as we touched the chairs at this table - apparently it was reserved.  Instead we squished ourselves around a small round table in the middle of the patio, with servers and diners brushing past you constantly.  Then, there it was:  the perfect table.  A small group of people got up from the corner table and we quickly stole it.  The staff hated us by this point because we had now been at 4 different tables.

What to eat?

The menu is long and boring.  I was too hungry to take the time to read the entire menu, so I chose my default - the bento box.  This included miso soup and japanese salad, rice, chicken teriyaki, tempura, maki rolls and gyoza (dumplings).  I hate when the lettuce for my salad is just one gigantic piece, which was the case here.  The gyoza, rice and teriyaki were fine.  The tempura was much too big.  Am I really expected to eat a deep-fried piece of broccoli the size of my head in a ladylike manner?  Good thing my friends no longer expect me to eat politely.  The maki rolls were the worst.  The rolls are usually my favourite part, but these were not fresh, not rolled tightly and quite boring for ingredients.

It was a great price for the quantity of food I received, but even so, not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was packed! That's because there is all you can eat buffet lunch for $11.99. We waited about 10-15 minute and was seated in a small table. You quickly fill out a sheet to order the items you want and the wait for the food wasn't long. The quality of the sushi wasn't superb and you can tell that it was quickly made without much effort. Minimal ingredients. Good thing was that the raw sashimi didn't smell. I recommend ordering the hand rolls rather than the regular 6-piece rolls. I recommend this place if you're looking for cheap eats and are willing to eat a lot. 
But definitely not the place to try authentic and fresh sushi."}
{"text":"This place is in the middle of nowhere! Park at the Valu Village close by, it's probably more convenient. I used to see Johnny pretty frequently back when he was in his downtown core location, and I'm glad he's still around. He has really high quality product for the price point he gives -- his uni ikura temaki is legitimately such a steal for the price, heaped to the max with dollops of pristine sea urchin. 

Don't expect incredible omakase-tier experiences with luscious pearls of balanced Shari. You're paying like half the price for similar quality fish though. 

Go if you enjoy the flavours and don't need the whole experience anymore. If you're happy with great tasting seafood for much more affordable prices, Kokyo is the place to be. 

A good bonus is that this new location is much cleaner compared to the last location, and the plates are nicer too. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I come to this place once every four or so months. Johnny is pretty knowledgeable about the going-on around town with regards to Japanese restaurants. 

You don't come here for sushi like Yasu, Zen, or JaBistro. It's undeniable that this place is much more of a hole in the wall, it's a little dark, the rolls are big, presentation is lacking, etc. 

But this is a great place for its price point. You can get pretty good quality fatty tuna, spot prawns, monkfish liver, uni, sea bream, and much more for very affordable prices. I would never bring a date here or anything since the atmosphere is wrong, but if you like sushi and don't want to blow a big wad out of your wallet, Kokyo has always been my go-to. In terms of what they offer, Kokyo is a good low-mid price Sushi place. 

I often have the uni, sea bream, monk fish liver, hamachi, sometimes the ikura, etc. Most of the time now, I just order a la carte. The value is still good considering you're getting exactly what you want -- but you need to get to the point in your Sushi eating experience that you know exactly what you're looking for. Kokyo is one of the best at fulfilling that need."}
{"text":"Is one hesitant to enter this establishment with the initial glance of the dated and dark interior? Yes. However, we took this option over the new and more modern looking sushi joint nearby to support what seemed to be a long-standing institution to the area. We were not disappointed in our choice. Take the decor out of the equation and the taste was on point. Yes, the rolls are on the larger size as pointed out in other reviews, but the fish to rice ratio is 3:1, so who is complaining? Fish tasted fresh in general. The staff were friendly. I don't expect a conversation when English is not a staff's first language. They did there job and we were completely satisfied. NB: We try a great deal of sushi joints when on holiday. If looking for fancy flare, then try somewhere. Otherwise, if very casual is on the cards, take the risk here."}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese food at a very reasonable price. I live down the street and it is my go to take out, and they have never let me down. Quick friendly service too. I get the salmon bento box - delish and more than enough for one person."}
{"text":"Okay I am usually very generous with my ratings when it comes to sushi (despite my biased upbringing) but there was not much here that I could really give props to when it came to this sushi joint.

First off, the smell that hits you when you walk in the door (at least the day I went during the summer) could be described as day-old fish sitting out. Perhaps I went on an off-day or my nose is incredibly sensitive, but this immediately turned me off before I even got the food considering fresh fish should never smell like that (let alone a restaurant). 

I ordered a run of the mill sushi combo (makis, nigiri, sashimi) since that's what I get at most places. The rice was much too moist still (needed more fanning or less water cooking), the nigiri's barely had any rice/formed poorly, and the slices of fish on top were massacred looking (as if a really dull blade was cutting the fish in the wrong direction...).

I couldn't even stomach eating the red snapper slices as they were just grey and limp looking...  To my disbelief, this group of students were happily digging away in the corner while I looked at my plate praying I didn't have to call in sick the day after because of bad sushi.

Perhaps I'll re-vist since I believe every place has a bad day and consistency may hav e been the issue. I just hope that smell doesn't repeat itself."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this restaurant as it is basically next door to me, but sadly it has gotten worse over the years. The fish does not seem very fresh, and the service has become surly recently. One particular waitress is in a chronically bad mood. I used to order delivery from there but after an incident where I received a lot of attitude from the delivery guy because my buzzer did not work, I have chosen other restaurants recently."}
{"text":"Kokyo has been a go-to sushi place for me over the course of my time in Toronto, mainly by virtue of its proximity, its large menu, and its very quick turnaround time on pickup orders at a reasonable price. I've been to some sublime sushi places in my time (Tojo's, Miku, Octopus Garden and Yoshi/Taiko in my hometown of Vancouver) and though Kokyo does not sit among their lofty ranks, in the scheme of Toronto sushi there's nothing bad about a meal here, especially for the price and with the friendly and fast service (I felt like I was welcomed in as a \"regular\" after showing up a couple of times for lunch!)

The only thing I will really knock Kokyo for is the salad. The salad that comes with the combo meals is bland, wet and floppy. Oh well... it's a sushi place! Not a huge deal-breaker, but it always makes me sigh for a moment when I see it. Fortunately, miso soup and bottomless green tea are also included in combos. 

Chef Johnny and his crew are pretty solid at what they do when it comes to inventive presentations of several core kinds of fish. There's a variety of rolls on offer, most of them quite substantial. A  few, perhaps a few too many, of these are variations on the \"Dragon Roll\" style to suit your taste (with avocado and tempura shrimp, and salmon/unagi/white tuna etc. layered outside) but there are others as well and most of them are pretty good (I particularly like the Sashi roll and the many-layered Johnny's Special.)

Kokyo offers a number of different combos and sets, often with customizable options that allow patrons to find something that works for them. You can also go a la carte if that's your preference, but I find that the sets make things easier. Side items like gyoza, agedashi tofu, tempura and such are done well, though they don't serve gomae which is a shame! The donburi are also good... I wish they had Oyako Don, but the Una Don is otherwise my favourite.

The nigiri is pretty much on par, nothing spectacular. The portions of fish, though fresh, are smaller than I'd like. I do enjoy the sashimi combos, though - you get big, meaty slices of tasty fish!

All in all, not bad at all. And an addendum: I've not yet seen evidence of poor hygiene as some reviews here have indicated."}
{"text":"Owner couples are super nice, sashimi are very fresh, superb! Definitely will come back with other friends!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with their food and service. I ordered the Nabayaki Soba Noodles (with broth, seafood medley, and shrimp tempura) and what I got on delivery instead was fried soba noodles, no broth, and with what i asume was chicken or maybe pork! (I do not eat meat so i couldn't eat this at all)--I couldn't believe it. 

This was so far from what i had ordered I was flabbergasted and frustrated (already really hungry) when I called them just asking for an explanation as to why this mistake had happened. But before I could get a sentence in they became defensive and began shouting that I had \"told\" them i wanted \"yaki noodles with chicken\" i very calmly explained that wasn't possible since i ordered through a third party delivery service and it said clearly on the receipt I did not order that (which is why i was sure the third party did not get it wrong). I spoke to two of their staff, going back and forth, by this time i was stressed, tired, and hungry, i began to cry and they just got even more defensive and never admitted to a mistake and kept insisting I had called and changed my order. It was unbelievable! I have never experienced such inconsiderate and rude service in my life. 

I will never order from them again and i warn anyone else from doing so as well. It was an awful experience.

On top of it all the one thing they did get right (veggie spring rolls) were sad, little (small and thin like a pinky finger) and flavour-less. The least enjoyable meal i've ever had. The absolute worst. 

If i could rate them less than 1 star I would."}
{"text":"Ok....They offer online order for delivery on BeyondMenu. It said they were open until 10:30pm, and that delivery takes 45-60 minutes. Cool.

So I put my order in around 7pm, and the food never showed up! I called the restaurant several times, and got no answer. I'm assuming they closed early, or have changed hours. Sad they aren't more organized....but from some of the reviews here, maybe I had a lucky escape."}
{"text":"I get the feeling that some of these reviews were meant for the previous establishment, Yamasaki, and not the current one (at the listed address) because the food left much to be desired. The space definitely looked more professional than Yamasaki, but it also meant it didn't feel as homey. 

Average waiting time after ordering for food was fine. Service was minimal but it got the job done. The fish were definitely not fresh and some tasted like they were barely thawed from the freezer. Rolls were messy and fell apart easily. If you're looking for finesse, stay away from this place. The food was palatable and the portions were alright, but I could very easily pay the same amount for much better quality food and service elsewhere.

Wheelchair-kinda-friendly simply because of the tight space."}
{"text":"Kokyo looks like the usual North American Japanese sushi place, but you do can find something that's not usual like the Wagyu sushi, blue fin toro sushi and the Uni nigiri which is a sea urchin handroll with the fish eggs. It becomes quite expensive if you order from the special menu and ask the owner what is fresh today. I went with 4 of my friend. The dining experience is just so satisfied. Average 50+ per person before tips. Their owner has a good seafood supplier, so the portion is good and the price is so dam good compare with the toro steak and sea urchin we usually can buy from the Japanese supermarket. Everything is just not like fantastic, but just so satisfied. If anyone going next time, remember ask for the special menu and it must be different experience than eating the usual NA dynamite roll... Lol"}
{"text":"This tiny hidden gem is well worth the money! If you like higher end sushi, definitely give this place a try! Johnny guarantees the generousity of the portions and the freshness of the fish. Make sure you call in a head of time to make reservations, since the restaurant is quite small. My favourite piece was the uni hand roll, $10 is very reasonable considering the size of it. Tried a few of the special menu fish and they're all worth the price. Averages about $50-$120 per person depending on how much you eat. I would definitely come back more often if the drive was shorter!"}
{"text":"If you like sushi, do not eat here. I can not comment on the cooked food as  did not have any.

The sashimi was cut too thick, and was not fresh, threw most of it away.

had a spider roll, dynamite roll and red dragon. Again, non of them were fresh enough, also they were too large. 

the delivery guy was polite and the food came fast, but with all the sushi places in the city I think I can honestly say I will NEVER order from here again."}
{"text":"Owner is very friendly, introduced every dishes to us. Love the Uni !!! Best uni but the price is very reasonable. Not a very big restaurant but the food is super satisfied. Must try uni hand-roll?will introduce to frds for sure~"}
{"text":"Having visited a few times for lunch over the last few months, I'm surprised and maybe a little saddened by the previous reviews of a formerly busy restaurant. Both times I've gone in the last two months, I was one of two tables. The quality of the food explains why.

I'm no sushi connoisseur, but it feels as though Kokyo doesn't respect the cuisine. 

If you're just interested in sushi-shaped objects, this is the place for you. I will give them credit for the portion size. While it's not exactly cheap, they give you a lot of food; I wasn't able to finish. However, it lacks the finesse of authentic sushi. The sashimi is thickly cut, 3/4-inches thick, way thicker than they should be, which I saw as a sign of laziness. The rolls look haphazardly put together, large and messy. 

The service is economical as you don't get any interaction beyond the first (and probably only) cup of tea, your order, and the bill. While it's not what I really need when having sushi, this might be an issue for customers who need a little more tending to. 

For a quick-fix of sushi, I'm not complaining. You get the taste and semblance of a Japanese meal. It just feels a little cheap and butchered. I'm not convinced it's worth another visit."}
{"text":"The sushi is good and so are the prices. The service could also be better. We are the sushi combo and we're pretty full. The combo also came with miso soup and salad! :)"}
{"text":"I regularly get delivery from here as the portions are huge and at an affordable price. While it is by no means the best sushi in the city, it is good value for money and consistently good. Delivery is usually quick."}
{"text":"I came here for takeout and it wasn't very good at all. The soup and salad were fine, but the sushi was poor quality and the salmon actually tasted off. It's unfortunate since I really want there to be a good sushi place in the neighbourhood (hell, I'll even settle for an OK place) but I guess it isn't going to happen. There are quite a few glowing reviews, so maybe it was an off day? Maybe this is a better place to eat in than take out?"}
{"text":"This is the first sushi place I ever went to in Toronto.
It is in no means very good.  I have even come here and have had issues...in terms of feeling sick.  
And I have, on occasion, smelled that \"fishy\" smell you are NOT supposed to get from fresh fish.

But for some ridiculous reason I always find myself back here.  Maybe it is because it is just good value and they do your order properly (If there are any substitutions you ask for they are good with it).

For some reason I am a regular here.  I am not quite sure why.  But I am and I will continue to be."}
{"text":"Placed an order with them. Then received a confirmation. Then the order never came and there was no call to explain it wasn't coming, it just never came.

Next day, restaurant never apologized or explained, and claimed they had no information, that I needed to contact another company whose phone number they did not have. How could they do business with a company and not know how to contact them?
The absolute minimum was an apology. There was no attempt to provide the food that I'd ordered in the first place, another minimum. I would have expected to them to throw me a free drink or appetizer to compensate for NOT having sent the order in the first place, but all they offered was we have no information and the impression that they don't care. 

This experience has soured me on this restaurant completely."}
{"text":"When we approached the restaurant the hostess who would soon be our server was outside picking her nails.

We were seated deep inside the resaurant and as soon as we sat down I had to go close the restroom door because I was getting a foul smell. But that didn't help and I got wafts of garbage smell throughout the entire meal.

At the end of the meal I used the washroom and after closing the door I noticed the mouse droppings behind the door. Not only that the entire place is filthy. Everything is covered in grime.

Who wants to eat raw fish (no matter how big the pieces of sashimi are) prepared in a filthy environment? Talk about a public health hazard waiting to happen!

AVOID THIS FILTHY PLACE."}
{"text":"Wouldn't expect that quality presented simply by looking from out of the restaurant, came here for a late lunch and it was empty (3:00PM) I had this place bookmarked long enough and wanted to check it out since doing so. Restaurant looks like every other sushi joint in the city within the pricing level maybe slightly more dated. 

Walked in the server asked us if we wanted anything to drink and if we have been here before. After a brief run down on the popular items we decided on 

Uni-Ikura handroll - this was amazing and stuffed with uni, I hated uni based on the fact that I thought even when fresh it had that disgusting fishy taste. 

Negritoro handroll - this was also very fresh and stuffed to the point where they give you another seaweed sheet to prevent spillage lol. 

Johnny Roll - I found this one nothing too special but it was above average comparing it to other restaurants with a similar roll... and it was huge.

Kokyo B or 2 don't remember lol - I'm definitely going to order this again along with the hand rolls next time as it was pretty fire. It would've been pretty standard as well but it had a smidge of uni in the roll that just carried the other flavours so well. 

Service was OK. I mean Mrs.Johnny was helpful with the menu but other than that and refilling our drinks she was in the back chitchatting with Johnny. Nothing that would taint this review though 

price point was pretty average to other a la carte sushi restaurants but the quality made it worth the trip (I came from Markham)"}
{"text":"Saw lots of bad reviews but I've loved this place for years. Not in the top japanese places in the city, but if you want a good bento box or spicey salmon sushi roll, this is the place. 

The quality is much higher than a place like New Generation sushi, and prices are reasonable. The patio in the summer is great--though close to the fire station. Definitely my favourite place in the area and I keep coming back."}
{"text":"We'll drive through snowstorm for their sushi!

Kokyo is my family's Friday night tradition. After working our way through the local japanese restaurants, we found Kokyo's new location is just within reach, and now head up there every week to get our fix!

While we always pick up and have yet to eat in the restaurant, the atmosphere is noticeably warm, quiet, and comforting. The miso soup is always fresh and ready to prepare us for the meal to come, and with favourites like the sashi roll and salmon sashimi, we are always impressed and satisfied. 

In the Fall of 2017 their quality did seem to take a short dip, but we were happy to return a few weeks later to the Kokyo we love and enjoy! If you visited around this time, give it another shot! Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"BUGS!!!!

I've been a loyal customer to Kokyo Sushi for the past four years. Enjoyed their sushi on most days but after what happened last night, i'll never return.

Last night after the Kokyo delivery arrived we found three bugs on our sushi, which looked like baby cockroaches. Disgusted we called back immediately. They insisted to pick it up and give us new sushi. Feeling a little skeptical as to why they would need to pick it up first, we marked the sushi...Yes its paranoia but you need to be safe when it comes to raw food. After 30 minutes, our sushi arrived and they offered it at half price. Very generous we thought, as we didn't even ask for a discount. We opened the sushi and saw the exact same sushi we had before. We called Kokyo and they blatantly lied saying they had replaced the sushi. After arguing for awhile she said she could make us a fresh batch for full price. She obviously wasn't getting the point. Jonny the owner refused to come to the phone. Supposedly he was napping at 7:30P during dinner service. He stood by that he re made it, but all of our marks were still there. She also kept going back and forth, not sticking to any real answer.  I am disgusted that they would treat their customers in such a manner. Firstly, it's a health risk, which they obviously don't care about and second they lied, loosing the trust of their loyal customers. It scares me to think how poorly they treat their customers, especially ones they know by name. New and old customer beware. This is raw fish we're talking about...if they don't take health standards seriously they shouldn't be operating.

I feel bad as I hate to loose a regular neighbourhood spot but there's dozen of sushi joints and I'm sure I'll find a new place soon."}
{"text":"Kokyo is an okay place, in a great location. They have an outdoor patio and we took advantage of it last night. Sitting outside was great but that's about all that was great for this place. Everything else--I've had better.

We ordered a spider roll, spicy tuna roll, red dragon roll and salmon sashimi. With sushi, size matters to me and I loved that the rolls were large. But they weren't the tastiest I've had. The \"spicy\" tuna roll didn't taste spicy at all and both it and the red dragon fell apart quite often for both of us.

Service was good. They were attentive without interrupting too much. At the end, our server offered to put our food in the fridge while we stayed and talked some more, then brought it back out with our bill.

I would go back for the patio and just order spider rolls...but it wouldn't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is small, unassuming and in the middle of nowhere but the foods really good! The sashimi was fresh, and the miso soup and rolls were delicious. It's also very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a very nicer restaurant then the old one. Easier parking but farther for me. The food is still amazing. The fish a very fresh and the quality a superior. If you never try their hand roll you should come here and try it. We will be back."}
{"text":"This Japanese restaurant surprised me. When you walk in you won't expect exotic meal until the food comes. We order from their special menu in the wall. The fish are 5 star standard. You won't able to eat this in lot of Japanese restaurant. The only let down is the lighting inside. Kind of dull. Otherwise this is one of the best."}
{"text":"All the rolls fell apart... Pretty sure the ebi shrimp was rotten as it had a sour mayonnaise taste, and the underside of ebi had large black patches on it... i puked everything out...

This place is way too overpriced for crumbling rolls and rotten shrimpd."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this restaurant more than a dozen times and am always very satisfied with their promptness in delivery and the quality of their foods. My favourite order is the Maki B set since it includes 18 rolls, a side of salad, soup for about $20. Their cripsy tuna is probably the best that I've tasted in the city and they are never cheap with their portions. You can always count on them to fill the rolls more with seafood and avocados than rice. I will continue to order from this restaurant when I feel a hunger for sushi."}
{"text":"\"Good honest food,\" as Bourdain would call it.

This is one of those under appreciated hidden finds.  Portions are very generous and fish is quite fresh. Nothing fancy here, but everything is consistently good.  In the 5+ years I've been coming here, I have not once had a bad piece of food.  I think that's rare and highly commendable.  It's also good price for value and the service is great.  In the summer, you can chill out on their patio."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, and I must say I have thoroughly enjoyed each time I went here.

Admittedly the service is a little unenthusiastic, but they definitely get the job done.  

Lunch specials could be a little better, I would like to see 2 Spicy rolls on their menu. (they have a take out special, 2 spicy rolls for $10, but no dine-in to my knowledge)

The rolls themselves were very good! over the spicy salmon, crab, tuna and white tuna I've tried (not all at once!), they were all well made, especially the salmon.  The amount they put in there is more than generous, which leaves you with a very large (and delicious) roll.

Of the sushi places around this area (and there are definitely a few!) I think this place has me coming back the most for their rolls.  While their prices and service may need some work, the food definitely makes up for it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the last ten years despite not really loving the place. The food is generally good to very good, and they have daily selections of specialty dishes like uni, monkfish liver and tuna belly that set them apart from the typical commodity sushi places. However, the restaurant itself leaves a lot to be desired. It often smells really bad and the washroom is pretty sketchy. The service isn't always great either."}
{"text":"hi.

i am a sushi aficionado. 

i LOVE sushi.
i LOVE sashimi.
i LOVE raw fish.
and everything that goes inside a sushi restaurant.

i do NOT love kokyo sushi. 

i came in and asked for take-out. 
i just wanted some salmon and some albacore sushi.
sushi, with the rice, means 2 pieces of fish with rice. 
so that would equate to 4 pieces of fish with rice.

right?! am i ... wrong? i can be okay with wrong, but i cannot be okay if i am right and THEY were wrong. because i ordered 4 pieces and i only got 2. 

oh, and here's the kicker ... the salmon sushi i got tasted a lot like SMOKED salmon. 

SMOKED SALMON SUSHI. 

something . is . wrong . here ."}
{"text":"We had best Uni hand roll last night. 
We will be back to try again!

Don't expacting too much on the food presentation.

The araverge of the price and food amount made it worth to trip down. (we came from mississauga)"}
{"text":"The sashimi pieces are huge here. I ordered the Premium Sashimi plate which said 14 pieces, I'd probably estimate it closer to 20 pieces. And they were cut thick. To finish one piece of salmon required 2-3 bites!

With that said, some fish pieces tasted better than others. I'd say the Hamachi was the best, it melted in your mouth.

Service was decent, not many smiles, had to tell a few jokes to get some expression. It's in a tourist area so it's fair that there are tourists in here.

Side street parking is $3/hr, I'll have to see if I can find something cheaper."}
{"text":"Like other posters said, sushi here is definitely sub-par! 

Had their lunch special sushi combo A and the roll was terrible. It was huge (note bigger isn't always better) and crammed with the nasty bits of what must be left over tuna drenched in spicy sauce to mask the taste. To top it off it had tons of tempura bits and cream sauce. The combination was an assault on my taste buds. 

Then the 4 sushi that came with the combo were small and failed to impress. 

Oh almost forgot about their watered-down salad; give me a break - if ur going to serve salad don't water down the dressing. It was nasty!!

Finally they, like many other crappy Chinese run sushi places in town, use the cheap soy sauce they filled into the kikomon bottles. 

Terrible food and def not worth it. I'm going to stick with Japango on Dundas and Chestnut - more $$ but million times better."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. It looks like your usual mom and pop shop - and it is run by a mom and pop. But you'll quickly notice what is different - the menu has speciality fish and even Uni and Wagyu beef. 

The rice was always the proper temperature. There is nice pieces of fish. There is a good combination of seaweed and other ingredients. The more expensive fish includes blue tuna and tastes great - maybe it is not just stuck in the fridge? 

I saw that there are a few regulars. Many of them come from a distance and know the owners relatively well. The reviews that were surprised at the quality are correct. The timeliness was good. The decor was fine. It's just the odd location. 

Great place and I hope they succeed! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"First off, i have had sushi in a lot of places, including in Japan on several occasions. 

The sushi and sashimi here are on par with some of the best places I've been to.  They use real banana leaf decorations and the rice is properly proportioned.   

The salmon is buttery and delicious and the rolls are beautiful and textured.  

We came here on New Year's Eve and this is probably why the service was a bit....curt.  

It wasn't slow or bad, per se.  it's just that the entire operation is one couple.  One man creates and one woman services 15 tables!   


They even finish off your meal with sliced oranges (which I think I is more of a Chinese tradition?) 

I will be back and recommend Kokyo"}
{"text":"We were really upset when we found out that Johnny had closed his restaurant at Yonge & Alexander (another condo development), so we were ecstatic to hear that he had reopened. Although the new location isn't exactly close to our home in East York, it was definitely worth the drive for a special occasion dinner. The new place is smaller inside, but the food and portions were exactly as before.

Johnny makes the BEST spicy tuna hand roll we've ever had, and we've had a lot. From NYC, to Chicago to Montreal, Kokyo Sushi delivers some of the freshest fish around. The portions are very generous, and some of the special fish he brings in is better than the highest priced Sushi bars in Toronto.

My 5 star rating is probably a little skewed because I'm happy and full from just finishing our first dinner from the new place, but it's certainly a 4 star experience consistently. I only wish he was closer to home.

I'm really looking forward to our next house party so we can order a couple of party trays!"}
{"text":"Great service, generous portions, nice ambiance.  

I have gone here 80+ times and have been disappointed maybe 1 time. 

My teacup gets empty and its refilled in literally seconds. 

Try the spider roll - it's amazing.  

The bottom line:
Kokyo is a decently priced, generously portioned Japanese restaurant with impeccable service."}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Generous portions. Food... not very good...

Was desperate for delivered dinner and settled for Kokyo. Food came surprisingly fast. I ordered the salmon teriyaki which came with rice, stir-fry vegetables, a salad and miso soup. It was a lot of food but it wasn't very good food. 

I probably won't come back. Lol."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 3.5 star rating.  I used to live not 5 min from this restaurant and overlooked it because it looks slightly tacky from on the outside.  Well... don't judge a book by its cover.

I ordered a sushi / sashimi plate for dinner and was impressed.  The portions were generous (the slices of sashimi were gigantic) and importantly, the fish was fresh.  The maki was also very big, so big that it actually got a little unwieldy.  The meal was enjoyable and the price was right, it was just missing that finesse of higher quality sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER ORDER FROM THIS RESTURANT UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE RIPPED OFF THEY ARE NOTHING BUT A SCAMThis is the absolute worst experience I have ever had trying to order from a resturant and I really wish there was something I could do more than this review. I ordered from just eat and paid online with my debit card. I was told my order was rejected so I called the resturant for an explination since my debit card was charged for the order. The lady on the phone apologized for the mix up told me my total and said that my order would be here within 45 minutes. An hour later I call again and she informs me that I cancelled my order (which I never did) and told me to never call again. My boyfriend called as well and tried to explain the situation and his number was also blacklisted. I Never recieved a refund. This is fraud."}
{"text":"Whew! Thought they'd closed. Just moved. 

I would've been apoplectic if this gem had been yet another casualty of condo sprawl.

Worth the pilgrimage. The Johnny Special Roll is great, as are the uni and toro."}
{"text":"LOVE the giant rolls.  Great service.  Very fresh.  I've been to many of the Japanese restaurants and sushi bars in TO (including some of the top-end ones) and this is my favorite.  I agree that bigger is not always better, but the Johnny Special and Kokyo rolls are PERFECT size and flavor.  And BIG good is better than small good - unless you're some overly health conscious, kayaking, ecotourism-loving, granola-eating, sweater over an untucked shirt-wearing, minimalist 20-something.  

Price is right.  Atmosphere is adequate (not too big, not too small).  Great specials.  Toro as fresh as I've had (including Japan).  I am indeed a fan.

The area around this restaurant is starting to become a little seedy/dangerous, but that's mostly due to Canada's ultra permissive views on alternative lifestyles (which apparently include aggressive panhandling) and is not enough of a deterrent to keep me away."}
{"text":"Happened to run into this great cosy sushi joint. Not overprice and large portions. Ordered the chicken and salmon bento dinner combo and it came with salmon sashimi and maki, cucumber maki, lots of tempura, miso soup, salad and orange to finish."}
{"text":"OMG SASHIMI!!!

Walking on Yonge St on a saturday afternoon, I really, really didn't expected that. 

I ordered a premium sashimi for 20 dollars, and the two of us couldn't eat it because IT WAS A LOT OF FISH. Fresh, delicious fish, giant incredibly well-cut sashimi!!! 

I'm a sashimi lover, and I've paid more than 100 dollars for \"premium sashimi\" on special occasions, I would never expect to have excellent sashimi served at 20 bucks. 

Their only downside is the slow service, but I can forgive. They also serve great misoshiro and green tea for free. Great experience, and I'm certainly going back."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! First time here and blown away. Definitely the best sushi place in this area.  Staff are friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Every time I go back, I have to order their Uni handholl. It's the best in town and there's probably more uni than rice. Other sashimi, though, are not as good. Their sea bream sushi is amazing too!"}
{"text":"You don't expect to find good deals on premium food items in a good location in the city, so I guess Kokyo defies expectations. They have a menu that goes on and on with giant special combo plates for really reasonable prices, and the items in the combos are pretty good. For instance, I opted for a simple tuna/salmon combo where you get-- for each kind of fish, mind you-- a couple pieces of nigiri, a few pieces of sashimi, and a full spicy roll, not to mention some miso soup, all for $15. WHAT?!?! That's ridiculous. We drank a bunch of sake so it didn't turn out to be a huge bargain but that wasn't Kokyo's fault. Service- good. Sake- plenty to choose from. Atmosphere- casual dress plus a bunch of TVs is right up my alley. The meal may not necessarily blow your mind but the variety of the menu and the total on your bill will. Kampai."}
{"text":"If you're adventurous with sushi (ie. eats any type of fish/shellfish) its the place to go. Their gems lie outside the menu, on the little chalkboard with the large variety of fresh sashimi that are rare in any affordable sushi places in town.  I'm talking stuff like monkfish liver, blue fin tuna and toro, Akagai clam, just to name a few.  Head chef & owner Johnny prepares excellent sushi with a good fish/rice ratio, so you aren't being stuffed by the rice.  The staff are always friendly and helpful.  I've brought many friends and they're now regulars too.  Bottom line, if you only eat salmon, california rolls, bento boxes, and cooked stuff, save the travel and go elsewhere. But if you're into quality sushi/sashimi, this is the place.

PS. Also ask for their black sesame ice cream. =)"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Kokyo a couple of months ago and it was pretty good value for your money. I ordered a bento box, which was served promptly. The food was fresh and the size of the portion was more than adequate. This is a pretty safe bet for me when I'm in the area and happen to crave Japanese food. Thinking of it, I might as well go to Kokyo for lunch next week. Yeah, good idea."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Meh. It's your standard budget sushi place that's slightly pricier than others in the area.

If you're hungry and in a bind, this wouldn't be the worst choice. Plus, they've got a patio. Their prices are slightly higher than the competition's but this is met by the MASSIVE portions. The handrolls, for instance, are about the size of your face! Their menu combos are also probably too extensive to the point where it would have been easier to say \"pick any 4 items for $15\". 

The thing that gets me though, is that their food isn't that fresh. Their sashimi tends to be mushy and warm, but given that this is par for the course for any budget sushi place, I'm not gonna hold it against them. But what was really disappointing were their avocado and cucumber rolls were almost of a puree consistency! Yikes. Tempering your expectations and enjoying your (at least) fresh beer will make things easier."}
{"text":"I DON'T LIKE GRATES!
I don't like the smell that come out of them, getting stuck in them with my heels, the feeling that at any moment I might fall in, and the Marilyn Monroe-esque dress flutter that occurs when I walk over one.
All in all I must say I try to avoid grates at all costs! 

The ENTIRE entrance way fro Kokyo is surrounded by one large grate! This to me is as appealing as going to a restaurant featuring a 200 year of drawbridge with alligators snapping below! I mustered up all the courage I had and ran across the front entrance screaming \"I hate grates\" until I was was safely inside.

The service was ok. Not great, not terrible just ok. I ordered the Spicy Makimono set and it was ok. Not outstanding, not horrible, just ok. In fact everything about this place was just ok, and looking at my fellow yelper's comments I would quote a wise Connie T. who once said \"Kokyo is another run-of-the-mill Japanese restaurant, with no real excitement or passion put into their food. \" 

If a friends wants to come here, rest assure it's not that bad, but I won't be coming back on my own accord (damn grates await me on my way out!)"}
{"text":"Not the best ...true ...but given your choice for Sushi in this area very good. ...Sit on the patio and thank the heavens that you are not eating at Sushi Sky that you see across the street.

They have done a reno and the dinning room, small as it may be is nice. The staff are good and the service is quick.

The prices are good and lunch is your best bet for a deal. The premium combos are very good for your money and quantity of food.

You will walk out satisfied in your meal, and with your wallet. As stated before, best for the area it's in."}
{"text":"This is my favourite a la carte sushi restaurant. It was my favourite when they were located at Yonge and Alexander and I've followed them to their current location. Forget about AYCE sushi, this is the place to spend a little $ to get fresh and delicious fish. Highly recommended is the special named after the owner himself - Johnny Special Roll."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop Japanese restaurant with great emphasis on their quality of sushi. They have a wide selection of fresh fish and the owner truly knows his sashimi. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came here for first time!  Definitely worth the trip.  The quality of the product is very high.  Portions were very generous.  The uni hand roll is really amazing one of the best I've had in Toronto.

The price was very affordable compared to the higher end sushi places in Toronto. I would say half the price  and the food is better than most higher end sushi restaurant in Toronto.

If you're looking for tasty casual sushi fix definitely give this a try. If"}
{"text":"This is officially my favourite Japanese place lol.
It's a little gem in the middle of a kinda sketchy area, you wouldn't even consider this place nor does it look like anything special around the area.

I love uni and if you do too, come here for the handrolll..... just look at my pics! They literally stuff the hand roll with uni, ikura and avocado. The taste of uni just drowns your mouth. I also think it's quite reasonable.. very reasonable. Other places is probably worth like $20, especially if you're in downtown core. 

I also LOVE their Kokyo roll. Again it has uni so I guess I'm biased but the flavours go so well together. Their noodles are alright and their sashimi is always so fresh.

Come down if you're by the area!! Worth a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Omakase in Toronto! Definitely try the Many types of Uni here! Nice and comfortable seating and friendly service. Chef Johnny is an awesome guy!"}
{"text":"Petit Japanese with a swell patio on Alexander.  But the swellness stops there.  The food was \"meh\" at best.  My pork cutlet don was underwhelming, and the pork was kind of soggy and tasteless. I stole a few sushi rolls from my dining partners and they didn't seem too fresh or interesting either.  After eating a piece of avocado as soft as toothpaste, i.e., too soft, I gave up.  For a place that advertises themselves as the \"Best Japanese Restaurant in Toronto\" they fall quite short of the mark.

Obligatory Title Pun:  I'd avoid this KOKYO, JOE.

Menu Readability:  Although well laid out, it's wayyyyy too long.

Need to mention:  For what it's worth: the portion sizes are good for the money. 

What this place teaches me about myself:  I have not eaten at the best Japanese restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time in Toronto for business and have to watch my intake of crap food as being on the road and living in hotel rooms it is very easy to make bad choices. So I tend to go for sushi as much as possible and having tried a bunch of places in downtown /Yonge St area of Toronto none can come close to Kokyo. The Sashimi is is ridiculously good, always tasting fresh and giving you good choices including fish you won't find and the regular sushi joints in town.
The rolls are sensational the miso soup is perfect.
I have eaten sushi in New York, San Francisco and LA and I have to say no place has come close to the quality I have enjoyed here.
The best ... period.

P.S REALLY friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"The ONLY sushi place I go to when I visit Toronto! I have made the trip up from Buffalo just to eat here. Portions are HUGE and the fish is very fresh and tasty. I recommend the Spicy Tuna/Salmon and also checking the marker board for what is fresh daily. My only gripe is the waitress never checked back except to bring the bill, but thats fine by me."}
{"text":"After hiding away from the world for the better part of the week yesterday we went for a walk to the drugstore. It was getting near dinner time and we decided to have dinner at one of our favourite sushi spots, Kokyo Sushi. Since moving the restaurant is outside of where we comfortably walk for dinner. At some point in the near past they renovated in that Restaurant Makeover way opting for a slicker and darker palate making the restaurant seem more sophisticated. They also opted for that New York style banquette seating that means tables sit really close to each other while everyone shares one long banquette. This kind of seating is fine for the young and supple of body but for anyone over 40 it becomes a pain. It is also difficult to navigate with winter coats and clothing. We opted for a small table for two off to the side which meant we were sitting alone and almost in the dark because of the \"mood\" lighting. For dinner we both opted for their steamy bowls of tempura udon which are always delicious. We both had samples of their sushi in a hand roll and a maki which were good. The food is not spectacular but what would be expected from a local place. The service polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a lunch special. The portions were big -- the sushi was more like sashimi wrapped with a teaspoon of rice -- and it came with pretty good miso soup and a small salad. Points deducted for an iced tea that obviously came right out of the can.

I wouldn't say that I'd run back immediately upon returning to Toronto, but staying at the Courtyard across the street, Koyko gets points for convenience. Seemed like it would be nicer to eat outdoors as it was sort of dark inside (and not in a good way)."}
{"text":"Read some of these reviews and thought  I would take a chance because it is raining and I live about a block or so away. 

I just moved to TO from Boston so this is my first sushi experience. It sucked. 

I ordered the spicy tuna and the yam tempura rolls. The yam tempura was barely cooked and WAY too big. Like five pieces of yam jammed into the roll. And it wasn't fried through so it had some raw potato-like texture to it. But okay.

The spicy tuna was seriously nasty. The rolls were not rolled tightly and falling apart. Too large to stay together and overstuffed with the nastiest tuna...ever. The tuna was gristly and also tasted cooked even though from appearance it was obviously raw. It tasted bad. So bad I didn't eat it at all. Wasted money. 

The prices were low and I did like that they included a container of soy sauce as opposed to the packets of sauce. But what good are these things if the food is not eatable?!

I am sitting here eating Life Cereal for din. Would call and demand my money back but I am scared to sound like a rude American. Do Canadians do that?"}
{"text":"Emmm and I would still give Kokyo three stars, even after reading the story about some cockroaches and such below. They haven't serve me any cockroaches so far, maybe they don't like me that much?

Service and atmosphere is what makes Kokyo one of my favorite sushi spots in that part of the Downtown. They are generally super-friendly, and I appreciate that - a lot! Many of the sushi places are sporting a bunch of kids who don't even pretend to be polite, while at Kokyo they are cool and nice - and genuinely so.

Food is not as elaborated as in, say, Yuzu - but it is honestly made and ingredients are clean. Portions are really big, and for the price they feel even bigger. Nothing of that typical \"70% of rice, 10% of fish, fill the rest with whatever cheapest\". Nice fat rolls, huge cuts of sashimi... I guess even if they'll ever think of adding some cockroaches - they'd put a lot of those, just following the trend!

Stupid jokes aside, I think this is a reasonably good place to go. They have not ever failed me and every time I exit Kokyo I am feeling positive and full - which is exactly how I want to feel after leaving a food place."}
{"text":"Hmm, wish I had read the reviews here before stopping by, but here we were, walking around downtown TO after staying up all night for Nuit Blanche  and getting 4 hrs of sleep that I didn't bother.  

The service was fine, good with tea refills, and alright.  The two stars is for the food... because that's what matters, right? :) Well, me and my bro shared the maki set B, option B, which was 6 pieces each of spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and spicy white tuna.  What a mistake, I forgot that spicy anything usually means slathers of mayo over everything.  Now this wouldn't be so bad, if it was tasty spicy mayo.  This was just mayo, my mouth wasn't tingling so it couldn't have been very spicy, and honestly, it just wasn't tasty.  

The thing that irks me the MOST when I'm eating raw fish though..... GRISTLE!! The red tuna and salmon both had quite a bit of it.  The white tuna, on the other hand.... I also really hate it when places say that have white tuna when it isn't tuna at all.  Coming from the West Coast, where albacore tuna is the norm whenever you order tuna, it really sucks to order white tuna and end up getting tilapia or some other fish that has nothing else in common with it except that it's white.  /end rant"}
