{"text":"I just came back from lunch from Outlaws.  A friend of mine recommended it to me yesterday and I have to say....it is really good.  They smoke the meats in house and you can smell the aroma in the parking lot!    It's probably the only quick-service BBQ place in Henderson.  Very nice if you are in a pinch for time.  I work at the corporate circle on Green Valley Pkwy and it was a cinch getting there.  Two exits down and exit Eastern.   In addition to BBQ they have a great selection chilis.  Love the decor too.  Fun place."}
{"text":"I won't have checked this place out, if I didn't go to restuarant.com and bought a coupon from them, but I was wasn't disappointed that I did!    Finding Outlaw wasn't too bad, and it's tucked away in middle of a shopping center filled with other eateries.   When I went in, the crew was incredibly nice, and the menu was your basic BBQ plate, Sandwich, and a number of versions of Chili.    I ended up purchasing  the Pulled Pork sandwich.  It was a very nice amount of pulled pork with Cole slaw on a very large Ciabatta bun (that had a branding of their name, nice touch)...I was so impressed with my sandwich, that I ended up buying another type of sandwich for dinner, and it was even better!    The Sliced brisket has a great smokey flavor to it, and I'm pretty much game for it in the next few days.     If you asked them about their chili, they will give you a sample, and I ended up buying a 16 oz container of beef chili..it was pretty darn good!!    I would recommend this place if you're looking for great  BBQ, and  don't want to break your budget.      I notice they even had a children menu, and had a make your own ice cream float deal."}
{"text":"Ate here with the Henderson family, we had a party of 12+ and everyone had a good time and enjoyed the food.  We're from Cali and found this place thanks to Yelp. 

Waiter was friendly, food was good price vs. portions wise as well as taste. No one left hungry. Sides are on the small side, but you get two with every combo meal.  We did 2 1/2 ribs, 1/2 chicken, a full slab of ribs and the beef brisket and had plenty of food left over. 

It was TG weekend and they were busy so they were out of some stuff, but we'll be back the next time we're out that way to try them again.  

Also, they had small games and puzzles at the tables which kept the kids (and some adults) occupied."}
{"text":"Ate here last Friday for a \"snack\".  Holy hell - their portions are huge!  Hadn't eaten a thing all day and didn't eat afterwards.  

My husband and I both got the pulled chicken sandwiches with mac&cheese on the side.  All I can say is DELISH!  I couldn't finish my sandwich (HAD to finish my mac&cheese!) - it was so loaded with chicken than it kept falling out.  No skimping - that's for sure.   Wished my dogs were in town with us so I could doggy bag the spare chicken for them..they would both consider it a crime that I wasted so much pieces of chicken :-)

They had a shelf of hot sauces if you wanted to use a sauce other than their house BBQ sauces on the table.  My husband used the house spicy and said it was HOT!  

Definitely worth a visit.  Fun atmosphere - pictures of all the old west outlaws, Wanted posters, etc. Plus old westerns playing on the TV.  The staff were very friendly.   Clean bathrooms too :-)"}
{"text":"My first reaction was that the food was kind of expensive.  There were recognizable barbecued meats, but it seemed more liked they were cooked on the kitchen grill than one of the barbecue variety.  There was a good variety of Barbecue sauces from around the country."}
{"text":"Really 3.5.I felt more of a 3, fiance felt more of a 4 so I decided to round up. The place seemed to be family owned and completely empty at 7 PM. I hope they are able to make it! It's hard opening a restaurant in this economy... anyways, on to the food!

Fiance ordered the pulled pork sandwich with no cole slaw. I ordered the pulled chicken. We had a side of mac and cheese. Cashier seemed friendly and excited we had actually stopped in.. lol. 

Sadly despite the fact that they were empty they didn't listen to our no cole slaw request.. no biggie. I realize that's just us being picky b*stards . They were both served on tasty ciabatta rolls. Weird for BBQ, but yummy. They had cute/bizarre brandings stamped on them.. Now the important part.. THE MEAT. The chicken was good.. I mean hell it's just chicken, what did I expect. The pork though was awesome. Tasty, juicy, etc. The mac and cheese was just eh... 

Basically they are getting the 4 stars because the pulled pork was good.. otherwise nothing terribly exciting about this place. I guess meat should be the most important thing about a BBQ joint anyways though."}
