{"text":"We went there because of the Groupon and had an okay experience. Waitress was very pleasant, but food was nothing to write home about. It could be because that was our first time trying Mediterranean food. Of the 3 dishes we ordered (can't remember their names) we enjoyed 2 of them but they weren't exceptional. The people there are nice."}
{"text":"This place just opened about 3 weeks ago in the old Famous Sams building. We walked in about 5:45 yesterday evening (Thursday) There was one other table at the time when we were seated. The building is quite large on the inside, with 4-top, 2-top and similar table setups. They have a stage, dance floor. Large bar area with ample seating. They offer music, belly dancing and such on Friday and Saturday nights. The Saturday menu is also a package deal so you get more of their menu in one package for cheaper. They also offer a hooka lounge area with hooka menu.  They had one person seating, waitng on customers as well as making drinks (even though she wasnt a bartender according to her). Our drinks were so so. But we will let her slide on that due to the fact that she did get 4 or 5 more tables at one time while we were there. They should consider having maybe one more person who can bartend/help serve. They do have a great list of craft beers and a speciality mixed drink menu that isn't too shabby!  Service is what took a star away on my review.  We started with a Lebanese sausage that was served with onion, peppers. It was quite flavorful and great portion size. We were brought a basket of fresh hot rolls that were white, wheat, and poppy seed, with a thyme, vinaigrette dipping oil that was quite flavorful. My boyfriend had the Lamb Chops dinner which came with 4 nicely sized lamb chops broiled with mjadara, sautéed vegetables & grape leaves stuffed with rice and spices. The lamb was melt in your mouth and seasoned perfectly. I had the Cleopatra special which offered a chicken, filet mignon and Kafta Kababs (ground beef) with rice, grilled tomato and onion. A side of a garlic butter type sauce was on the side which was to die for and I had asked for a second serving and did not receive it either due to the one person and the rush she was hit with while we were there. Overall I am very happy to have finally found a place that makes killer beef kabobs that are not tough or under flavored. I will give the service a second chance. I think they are newly opened and going thru growing pains so I would suggest checking them out. Great food. We plan to go back on a Saturday night to check out the entertainment."}
{"text":"When I want good Mediterranean food, I always choose Cleopatra's.  The hummus is fantastic. We always start with the hummus and an order of meat pies.  The meat pies are so flavorful!  Our other fo to is the Cleopatra Combination.  The kafka, chicken and steak are tender and flavorful. The roasted veggies are good. What is really nice is the garlic paste.  So good!  But if you're with somebody, you had better both eat the garlic or you might find yourself with nobody to \"talk to\" later.  Also, if you dine before 9pm, the restaurant is fairly quite.  The service is great and friendly.  They are always ready and willing to help out the mid-east food neophyte."}
{"text":"This place is great, good hookah, well made cocktails and hummus that will make you question all other hummus you have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"This restuarant is terrible!!! Dont waste your time. The service is even worse.Our waiter wouldnt even come to our table. I had to walk up to the kitchen to tell them I wanted to order food. When I got my food, it was undercoooked and when I told the waiter, he said I'm sorry instead of replacing my order. There glasses they serve drinks in didn't smell clean either. They also over charged me on my credit card which I had to dispute because they dont answer there phone and our waiter didnt even know what Pino Grigio was.    Next time you hold an event, instead of cheaping out, hire more waiters who know the name of drinks. I will never go back and will let everyone know of my experience"}
{"text":"Went for my sons birthday with a groupon. What a pleasant surprise. Service was great, food was delicious. Ambiance is good however they need more staff to service the tables. Took forever to receive our check after requesting then forever to bring change.  Gave a $20 for a 3.73 bill and received $11.00 in singles . Call me cranky but that is rude and assuming that this will ensure a large tip.  The only other tip I want to give is on off days when I owned a restaurant or hours when closed staff would clean. The black speaker hanging from the ceiling has dust and spider galore. Yum a nice garnish with chicken kabobs!"}
{"text":"We were a little worried when we arrived at the restaurant at 6 PM and there was no one else there. In addition, some of the kitchen appliances were sitting in the dining room as though they needed to be sent to storage or just weren't put away. So, we were pleasantly surprised when the service and food was excellent. There were four in our party and we each tried a different dish. Not one of us had a complaint about the food."}
{"text":"The sofa section with the hookahs and the dance floor looked like something I wanted to partake in but the service was less than wonderful and the food was undercooked - I've had better.  Unfortunately, most Middle Eastern restaurants that I have been to lack In the service department. We were the 2nd table in the Egyptian themed restaurant. About 10 min after us, a large group came in and the one server/bartender didn't seem to be able to cut it. We had an appetizer before we had even ordered our main meal. We were done with the appetizer before we even got a chance to get drinks or order our main meals. This meant that we were sitting with menus in our hands while eating the appetizer. It wouldn't have been a big deal but I really wanted to have a drink other than water as well.   The appetizer we got was the Cleopatra platter for $15 and it had a lot of food with it! I think the best item on the platter was the Tabouleh but adding the meat to the hummus was also pretty tasty. For me, that's where the praise ends.  The service was poor due to being understaffed so I had to flag down someone when my Salmon Kabob came out RAW. The Shrimp Kabob was good but it was not an easy process to actually get to the meat. Even after the Salmon was replaced, no one bothered to even offer to discount any part of the meal. Overall, I am disappointed and will probably not go back.  Meh. I've experienced better."}
{"text":"I took my fiancé here for a romantic dinner with a groupon I purchased for him. We love Middle Eastern food and couldn't wait to try out the kabobs and basmati rice, humice and falafel.  We went in and the place was almost empty, with just a few couples dining.  There must have been about 10 staff members, several of whom were sitting in the hookah lounge, smoking, yet we had to wait to be seated. Televisions with Arabic programs were playing a bit too loudly, but that did not deter us despite wanting a nice atmosphere.  Should have left from these minor issues, but had a groupon to use so shook it off and waited.  We were seated in the middle of the room next to the hookah lounge and ordered our food and a drink.  All was well for about 10 minutes.  Then all of a sudden, staff started hauling couches and lounge chairs out of the restaurant and hauling folding tables and chairs in through the back and past our table.  They opened the doors in the back and hauled in several chairs at a time, laying the chairs all over.  It was a circus and the place was freezing because the doors were open.  It was like dining in the middle of a house where the movers came in to move you out.  It was loud, chaotic and anything BUT romantic and pleasant.  At first I politely asked what was going on and to please close the door because we were cold. They did no such thing and the service only got worse. The waitress told us that even though it was chaotic now, the fun would be coming because they had belly dancers coming, so to just be patient. They claimed a big party was coming in without notice (we are talking about 80 people and that they needed to prepare for them. Then I was angry and complained about being cold and being seated where we were practically being hit by legs of chairs while staff hauled them in...to which they made excuses.  Our food arrived, we shoveled in what we could and got the bill with no deductions for the disasterous service and chaos in the place. I am not even sure about the quality of the food because I was so ticked off about everything else, it was ridiculous. The belly dancers or whatever music get-up they had planned were not there by the time we left at 9pm and I wouldn't have stayed if the real Elvis arrived on stage!  The groupon was not worth what we paid for it and in fact, it was the WORST dining experience I have EVER had.  Heck I have had better dining experiences in the McDonald's Playland!  I would not ever go back to this horrific place. The only positive thing about the whole place was the lamps and getting out of there without getting hit in the head with a chair leg! I have to give it a one star, but it hurt to even give them one!"}
{"text":"The food is good. That's about it. The service sucks. I had my baby shower here two years ago and left very disappointed..now two years later I decided to give it a second chance and it still sucked. Our food was about an hour and a half late, after we placed our order..and it was cold. The place was ridiculously HOT inside and they did not bother turning on the ac or even the fans. And again, as always, the owner refused to pay for their performers. This place needs new owners ASAP. I will not be giving them a third chance that's for sure. And instead of the owners walking around making sure guests are comfortable, they were sitting down the whole time smoking their hookah with no smiles on their faces! I wish I could rate them a Zero star."}
{"text":"Always slow first time I came here the filet minion kabob was on point second time around not so great but friendly staff worth a try"}
{"text":"I just had and excellent Mediterrranean / middle-eastern meal here at Cleopatra's here in Gledale, Arizona, and without doubt the best middle-eastern food in the west valley!!! The meal was flavorable, and enjoyable. Prices are reasonable, and best of all you are waited on a very gracious staff. Family owned and operated this is truley great middle-eastern dinning pleasure."}
{"text":"Dined here last night while attending a benefit comedy show the show started at 8pm so we arrived at 6:30 so we could talk and eat dinner.  When seated we immediately got water but then our waitress was no where to be found.  When we saw her again  we couldn't seem to get her attention. After a long wait we finally did by then several friends of ours who were also there early for dinner and the show, couldn't get service so I told her they wanted to orderr. With prompting she finally waited on their table as well.  Other friends of ours who were there for the show walked out because of the poor service because they were hungry and tired of waiting. THE SERVICE HERE WAS TERRIBLE ! We had to ask for everything from that point on because the waitress like in the review Pepper T. was alone so it wasn't her fault. The restaurant was warned that the place would be busy for the benefit and they only had one server on the floor.   There was three of us in my party. Kathy R. my wife and myself. We ordered coconut shrimp and spinach pies for appetizers. After a while the waitress informed us they were out of the coconut shrimp at that point we ordered our drinks since the waitress still hadn't asked what we wanted. I stuck with water my wife Carol got a coke and our friend Kathy R. ordered an ice tea.  Because we were there for the comedy show and we were visiting with a lot of people we knew before we realized it an hour had gone by and still no food yet people all around us were getting served. We ordered the Kafta Kabab ( $13.95 )  which was marinated ground beef mixed with minced onions and seasoning and Filet Mignon Kabob ( $16.95 ) Marinated Filet Mignon with grilled veggies. But after another hour waiting for our food there was still nothing. When we finally inquired where our food was we were told by the waitress she lost our ticket but our food was in the back and she would get it. More waiting and waiting and waiting. By now the comedy show started and it was 8pm and our food finally arrived.   Both of the Kababs were not hot they were warm, the meat was overcooked, dry and tough. I was expecting a flavorful Lebanese food , NOT!! Would have been much better warmer. The waitress never even asked how our food was. They get a single star only for the pita and the rice, beyond that.... fast food has a leg or two up on their food. Sad but true!   FOOD: The kebabs were dry and without much flavor. Overall a big waste of money. We left hungry, and needless to say I was pretty dissatisfied with the whole establishment, the food and can not recommend it. PRICE: Expensive for what you get. The food is my main complaint, which is pretty serious if the review is about a restaurant. SERVICE:  EXTREMELY SLOW !!. Obviously I'm waiting for my food and even after asking about it were still waiting.. but still no word... Seriously?  AMBIANCE:  Modern Middle eastern with plenty of room. Definitely NOT short on ambience. But my review is not about the ambience or the comedy show it's on the food there. CONCLUSION:I rate this place at a 1 Not worth wasting your money. We're never spending another penny at this place. Sad the first time I ate here and it will definitely be the very last RETURN FACTOR: 0  ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT"}
{"text":"My husband, two kids(2&13) and I went for dinner on a Friday about 5. There was only one other table of people. It was fine though because they had music playing so it helped with it not being too quiet. The service was great! The food was excellent! Our server said that live music and dancing starts at 9:30. My husband and I decided to take the kids home and go back for a date night. We sat at the bar from 8:45-11:00. We had a nice time but no live music or dancing happened . At least not while we were there. A lot of sound checks but that's it."}
{"text":"My dinner here tonight was really pleasant.  We ordered the hot appetizers plate, which gave us a nice sampling of several items, all of which where good. The lamb chops were terrific - juicy, grilled just right, and with great flavor; I love lamb and these were the best lamb chops I've had in years! I was also pleased by the items in the Cleopatra plate - properly grilled chicken, beef, kafta, and vegetable kebabs on a bed of fluffy basmati rice.  The dining area is very spacious, table settings were impeccable, and the service was very friendly and gracious. I am glad that we have this new restaurant in this northwest part of metro Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love the food here, but I just came by at 6:30 on a Friday to get some food and they're closed... nothing posted on the door that they would be closed during this time... super disappointed. Please update your hours of operation if you're going to be closed. That's just bad business."}
{"text":"In my very wonderful neighbourhood are a number of Eritrean and Ethiopian restaurants and the first I tried, Cleopatra, is still one of my favourites. I feel lucky to have such authentically ethnic varieties of food within my reach and this little place is one of the best!    Here are the reasons I vouch for Cleopatra:   1. They have the most delicious falafel wraps I've ever tried  2. They have excellent vegetarian and meat filled dishes  3. The price is right; nothing is over $10  4. The staff are all very kind and talkative. They love to dish about the hood, give you suggestions on good eats and thank you sincerely for your business.  5. I was introduced to shwarma here and never looked back since!    Cleopatra is a small, dimly lit eatery on Bloor at Dovercourt. There are seats if you want to eat in, but it's not really a sit-in place. It's next to Pizza Pizza and my wish is for everyone who feels like a slice, to skip it, and move two doors down to something so much more satisfying and delicious.   I like that Cleopatra has vegetarian varieties (falafel, cauliflower sandwiches, etc) and everything there is fresh and healthful. Every so often I'll stop in and purchase a shwarma or falafel and my day becomes instantly better!"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding, served hot, and delicious. Portion size was enough for lunch the next day. The atmosphere was inviting. Wait staff courteous and fast. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing  kibble and some great appetizers but that's about the only good thing I can say.   Dry lamb kebabs, grizzly meat on the hummus, strange atmosphere altogether.   Bummed.   I  need a good Middle Eastern restaurant."}
{"text":"We live in the area and finally tried this place, glad we did.   We split 3 apps and entree.  For the apps, we did the spinach pies, the cheese borak, and the maanek (sausage).  For our entree, we did the lamb kabob, which came with rice and veggies. Everything we had was delicious.   The place itself is quite large, they have a stage for live music and a robust bar/lounge area.  I hope this place does well because it's fun to branch out with a non-chain option.  We didn't have any issues with service, our server checked on us frequently as did the other staff."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing.  It hasn't been busy either time that I came, but for the price and the serving size, I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for something out of the ordinary and truly unique.  The inside has a great atmosphere complemented with music videos of artists from all over the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Northern Africa.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"My fiance' and his family have taken multiple large parties to this restaurant over the last few years.  The food is always awesome and we have always received excellent service WHEN WE ARE WITH THEM.  However, today I went in to make a catering order for our small wedding ceremony we are having in a week.  I called ahead, spoke TO THE OWNER who said he was the person I should speak to and I informed him I would be in in an hour.  I was and I asked for Tony.  I ended up sitting at the bar for over an hour with no Tony.  We had ordered an appetizer while we were waiting and never got the check.  I ended up storming out after getting no attention from anyone.    THIS IS AN OWNERSHIP PROBLEM ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The staff was too sparse for the party that was going on and everyone was angry.  The bartender had one helper and there were no waitresses.  And, by the way, the bartender had to read from a book to figure out a drink that was ordered and it took her 20 minutes to figure it out.  On top of everything else, one of the partners of the establishment was sitting right next to me at the bar and never once offered help or introduced himself.  Guess he figured he didn't look like anyone so I wouldn't know who he was.    I am telling my in-laws to never take another party there and I will never darken their door again until it says 'UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP' above the sign."}
{"text":"POOR SERVICE , BAD DRINKS , and SPOILED FOOD.  I do note the poor service was NOT the waitress's fault as she alone was waiting on close to fifty people all by herself.  We looked at the wine selection and decided to go with mixed drinks so we ordered a mojito and long island iced tea. When the drinks arrived we tasted them and they nearly tasted the same. Both tasted mainly of budget artificial lemon aid drink mix. Nether of us could stomach these drinks. The drinks were truly horrible.  We ordered two appetizers, the falafels and the Lebanese Muhammara (spicy red pepper and walnut  dip). I thought the dip was good but the falafels weren't really made right. They were fluffy but had hard things in them that might have been chunks of uncooked hard beans?, unless it was something nonfood?  I was afraid I might break my teeth eating them.  Our dinners arrive and when I took a bite out of the salmon it wasn't right. The salmon was past not fresh and was spoiled. My husband confirmed it as spoiled. The waitress is running around with lots of tables and never comes back. I am left with a plate of spoiled fish to look at. I nibble on the few vegetables I have and notice they cooked some of my tomatoes but added a RAW tomato to plate. (see photo) My husband gives me some food off his plate so I'd have some dinner.  On the cleopatra plate the Kafta had good flavor but was dry. The Chicken was flavorful and good. The filet mignon was so overdone it was dry , chewy and tasteless and didn't even taste like beef with no beef flavor left in it. The plate was came with a little cup that I thought might be hummus but turned out to be unmelted garlic butter.  If somebody puts a gun  to your head and makes you come here for dinner get the chicken kabob.  The waitress arrives and ask if I want a box for my plate. I told her no because the fish was spoiled. She told the management and nobody said anything to me but my meal was removed only because I had a buy one get one coupon.  You won't see any belly dancers either unless you eat dinner at 9pm or later.  This is a new business and I hope they work things out and improve because we have very few nice places to dine at in this part of town.  BUT I NEVER imagined the first time I was here and didn't eat would be the better of my two visits.  I do feel slightly bad but not completely.  My thoughts are I can't forgive about spoiled fish they didn't care about but I did enjoy the chicken and the pepper dip.   But bad management can spoil a place as we know."}
{"text":"I arrive at the restaurant looking forward to trying the food. I love foreign cultures. and the guy looks at us and doesn't say anything. We have to tell him that we would like to eat. Then we sit there for 30 minutes. No one greeted us or acknowledged us. Cool looking place. Never got to try the food. I am ultimately disappointed and uncomfortable. I don't know if it's the way I dressed or because I'm just a normal American but for someone who loves foreign food and cultures and has been to a lot of culturally different restaurants I have never felt so unwelcomed. So sad. I guess for future reference make sure you understand the culture. I will probably never go back."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere good food music very entertaining and if you are familiar with a middle eastern business and Hookah lounge then you should go . If you have never been before take some friends and go very friendly staff and owner is personable."}
{"text":"Me and some friends  went there to enjoy some drink and try some middle eastern meal. We waited almost an hour just for the waitress to ask us for a drink. After hour later waitress came and ask us what we like to drink soon is drink came we left the restaurant.Terrible service , feels like they only serve people they know inside which is from their own country . Never will go there again."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised. The staff were very friendly, the food was flavourful and the price was incredible! We sat in the restaurant and there were many people doing the same thing. I'll definitely go back!   I agree with the previous post - walk right past Pizza Pizza - you'll get tastier, healthier food and you'll support a small local business."}
{"text":"My mother in law has a family friend in town who is originally from Lebanon, so a group of us got together in search of some good falafel.  We found it at Cleopatra.  We came in early, so weren't too surprised that it was quiet. I got to sample (from various plates in our group) the Chicken Schwarma, the Kafta Kabob, and the Filet Mignon Kabob.  The rice and vegetables were excellent (a happy little kick to the vegetables!), as was the cold appetizer plate I ordered, which included Dolmeh, Baba Ghannouj, Tabbouleh, and I swapped out the Hummus for Falafel (our waitress was very accommodating!)  It was interesting to watch the small group of hookah smokers who came in, and our waitress (again - very accommodating and sweet; no sign of awful service for our party!) gave us a mini crash course on hookah.  We were happy to have discovered something a little different from the norm here in the West Valley; I hope others will try and enjoy Cleopatra so it's around for years to come!"}
{"text":"Everything exceeded our expectations - everything was awesome. Had the Geek salad, combo apps, and combo Cleopatra dinner - it was all yummy!"}
{"text":"Hubbies and I shared a geek salad with lamb. Not a combination I have had before, but I will definitely do it again. It was really flavorful.  We also shared Cleopatra platter. It comes with a garlicky sauce. Use sparingly and it was awesome. We had enough to take home for another meal. Has great decor and had no wait on a Friday night. We will be back."}
{"text":"Beware If you order any Entrée & you don't find it to your expectation & you want the management To fix the problem then you're going to the wrong place.The management don't have the customer service mentality to please you .They wouldn't want to replace or fix your dish at their expense..I had that first hand experience.also beware on weekends they have hookah night if you have allergies or if your pregnant women..lastly if you have group 10 of friends if you don't pay attention to your bill I assure you they will over bill you make sure you keep tap on what your ording."}
{"text":"This is the most delicious middle eastern restaurant we have here in Phoenix. It doesn't matter how far you need to drive, it's worth the trip. We found Cleopatras thru group on and have been back multiple times. Each time, it's as fresh as can be, flavorful, and authentically Delicious"}
{"text":"Wasn't really my favorite place but the atmosphere was very nice and there is a wide selection of food. I feel that it was just my first introduction to this type of food and when we went there I wasn't expecting to eat this type of food. There is a hookah lounge in the front of the restaurant if you ever just want to go and hang out and then get some food while you're there."}
{"text":"The food was good.   The service needs a lot of work! No special recognition for the 2 people at our table who were celebrating their birthdays. One person didn't get her dinner until the rest of us were finished eating already. Waited and waited for the check and finally had to ask for it. Gratuity added automatically without any prior notice.   No authentic Mediterranean or Middle Eastern drinks? No wine list to speak of. No regional chai, tea or coffee drinks to speak of. And wasn't there supposed to be live entertainment this weekend? We saw none.   You have a lot of room for improvement Cleopatra's. Now I know why the place was almost empty last night."}
{"text":"Unlike the real Cleopatra who swooned her subjects with her beauty and majestic presence, this Cleopatra is a plain Jane from the exterior.  It's in a non-descript strip mall next to Winco and from the exterior, it looks like a sad, forgotten bar.  And we were a little confused by their hours of operation from 3pm-midnight. Luckily, this Cleopatra is anything but plain Jane when you walk thru the front door.  It's by no means fancy.  Instead, I felt like minutes before I was in Phoenix, AZ and now I am in another country, more specifically Turkey. The interior of the restaurant is what I imagine a restaurant in Turkey would be set up.  To the left, big seating area with couches for those communal pipes and drinking of coffee and tea by men.  To the right, lots of table and chairs with numbers on them for what I assume is for karoke singing and dancing as to the right side back there is a band setup, karoke machine, and a dance floor. The best surprise, which every restaurant strives for and what costumers to write about is that the FOOD was delicious, excellent, and mouth watering yum, yum! We ordered the Cleopatra salad, spinach pie, falafel, lamb chops and chicken kabob. The salad dressing on the salad had just the right amount of herbs and tanginess that it opened up our appetite.  My son devoured the chicken kabob and asked if we could get the recipe from the restaurant.  My husband and I loved the spinach pie, falafel, and I loved the lamb chops.  The lamp chops were perfectly grilled.  And the falafels were possibly the best I've ever had.  Slightly crispy on the outside but oh so delicate, moist and flaky on the inside. Throughout our dinner, we commented that we were soooo happy to have come here, what a pleasant surprise the food was as from the exterior, we did not expect much and how we would definitely return again as good Mediterranean food is hard to find in the Valley. So Cleopatra, thanks for a wonderful dining experience and see you soon again!"}
{"text":"Not as good as Persian Room, yet they have really good meat and great service.  Hookah is well packed, hookah guys are nice and change out charcoal and maintain regularly. Lots of options.  They also have live music sometimes. Drinks are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Love my nationality. Absolutely love this place and Mijana. Very fun for an Assyrian and Chaldean get together!"}
{"text":"I used to order from this place all the time when I worked in the area. I would get the same thing each time: falafel with fries and a Coke.  Maybe not the healthiest combo you can think of, but the kicker was this was all for $3.99! And even though I don't drink Coke much anymore it was the coldest, freshest taste after eating those delicious fries. The falafel was obviously the main course and downright delicious.  The staff was always so nice to me even though I only got a cheap combo every time. Definitely a great place to hit up on your lunch break -- quick and incredibly easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"How sad this restaurant closed.....their food was superb, which is something that cannot be said for the average restaurant  in the west valley.   The rack of lamb could not be beat. There are too many mediocre  restaurants around and when a good one turned up it just wasn't appreciated.   So what is if were a little pricey, it was well worth every dollar.  Maybe they will open up again in another location....we can only hope."}
{"text":"After 13 months Norm R and I returned to Cleo's on Saturday evening, 10/19/13, and we remain totally satisfied customers who loved the food before and now. This time I went for the lamb chops I'd sampled before and they were equally perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, tender, moist, and just, well, perfect.  The plate also included I think 4 stuffed grape leaf pieces, which were quite satisfying and tasty, and a bed of fluffy  (basmati?) rice.   There were perhaps two groups of 10-12 each, and one other pair of unaffiliated customers in the large dining room.  Our server was friendly, helpful, and kept on the move.  I did not notice if there was another server, but as on our previous visit, there was a separate person serving as bartender, so our server was not doing double duty. My water glass only went dry once for a couple of minutes, and never required flagging our waitress down for refill.   Having a bit to spare at the end, we treated ourselves to a baklava, which unusually but deliciously, was served warm.    Not so much a negative as a distraction, there were perhaps four barren, slightly battered small tables with chairs outside along the sidewalk. With no tablecloths or anything else, they just gave the impression of being a place for the middle eastern guys to sit outside and smoke, though they were unoccupied on this occasion.  Overall however, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal and have no complaints about the service.    Good Lord and Groupon willing, I'm hoping for far less time in between the next visit."}
{"text":"Well the host at this place wasn't welcoming at all, they seat us in the corner, wait for over 30 minutes, don't even get acknowledged. Weird vibes. Wanted to try the food but won't be back to find out. Bummer. Cleopatra, more like Cleopat_nah."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were going to eat at this restaurant even after reading some of the negative reviews for this place. When we got to the door, we noticed how run-down this place was although they've only been there for a year.  Upon entering, it was very bright and had cafeteria-styled seating to the right, rows of sofas for hookahs on the left, a giant bar at center, and was not-at-all busy for a Friday night. There was one waitress as far as we could tell, who was confused by why we were there, \"are you here to stay for dinner, or...?\" We were seated, began reading the menu, and everything was quite expensive.  We decided based on the ambiance to go to the amazing fondue and crepe place just across the parking lot."}
{"text":"First time here, came early on a  Saturday evening and we were not sure what to expect.   The 4 of us ordered different items inckuding hummus and  Greek salad.  Both were outstanding.  We also ordered an Cleopatra appetizer combination plate with many different items on it, the chicken shawarma and the filet mignon kabob.  Everything was outstanding.  Everything was cooked to perfection and the flavors were  \"to die for\".  Our server, Shelby, was knowgedgeable and very helpful.   This is definately a restaurant thatt we will soon return to."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here tonight to attend a benefit. We sat there for 1.5 hours and not one person from the staff ever acknowledged that we were there.  We were never even given menu's! I can't even say we got bad service because we got no service at all. Other people there were having the same experience. Those that did order food waited for an hour for it to come to the table.  There were 3 people behind the bar..why didn't one of them come out on the floor to wait tables.  I will never ever go to this restaurant even if it is free. I gave it one star because I had to. I hope someone is seeing this review! When I go to the page for the restaurant I do not see it!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this but last night we took the food to go and all the food we ordered before didn't taste the same. Either too spicy or chewy and dry . We ordered cold appetizer and they gave us hot. Spent over $66 and disappointed."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place!...except the service. We went on a Sat night for a friend's birthday. The belly dancer was awesome and funny. The band was excellent. Everybody there was super friendly and welcoming. And the food was so good! Our only complaint was that the bartenders & waitresses seemed to not really care that there were customers there. We bought a Yelp deal and they were refusing to honor it...then we went up to the bar to talk to someone else and he refused to honor it. My fiancee, who works at Yelp, knew it was valid & that they had to honor it & eventually they did. A minor inconvenience though for an otherwise great night!"}
{"text":"The food is great, but the restaurant is shady. I placed a large order through GrubHub and waited for for over an hour and a half until the expected delivery time. Then I waited another 30 minutes for good measure, when I called GrubHub they talked with the restaurant and they were informed by the restaurant that they did not have a driver and they did not make the order.   This is appalling to me, all the restaurant had to do was contact GrubHub and tell them they were not able to complete the order. I would not have been happy, but I would not have waited two hours with no food being made. This makes me re-think whether I should even return to the restaurant to eat in."}
{"text":"Went back here tonight with my family. They loved the zucchini rings and the saffron rice. Mom likes the grape leaves. The wings are really good. The lamb was a little bland. I like the feta in the Greek salad and the olives were delicious. The atmosphere is nice, it's not loud, you can have a conversation. Nice bar and hookahs."}
{"text":"Came at very nearly closing time, with a Groupon.  Absolutely fantastic food, great service. The ambiance and decor are beautiful,  the service courteous and attentive.   My only critique is that waitstaff should be more knowledgeable about what ingredients are in the menu items."}
{"text":"Once past the strange vibes of this at once overly ornate and simultaneously cavernous restaurant, the food is surprisingly good. Not much that is unique, but well executed Middle Eastern food. On weekends they offer entertainment and one most likely to require ear protection. The basterma and baba were very good. The Armenian sala a surprise, and the lefts plate plentiful. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was not good and service was poor. Loud music and ghetto. The music was very loud and got uncomfortable. The grilled plate came with grilled chicken that had no flavor to it and the rice was basically boiled in water. It took forever for the servers to bring food and drinks. I had to ask for my soda and water 3 times to get it. Overall poor experience i will not go there again."}
{"text":"this was the worst service by far, this place is under staffed, for such a big place that gets pretty busy on weekends it only has 3 servers that ive seen  when we have a party of 10 or 15 and there is one server who has many other tables that are also big parties it takes forever! i have never waited so long for a simple hookah.   the BAR IS EVEN WORSE THERE IS TWO OR ONE BARTENDERS AND THEY ARE SLOW THEY SUCK AT MIXING DRINKS. AND THEY ARE OVERPRICED.  I pay for quality and if i am paying a good chunck of cash on the weekend i expect good service. they need more staff for sure. and new bartenders. it just takes too long for everything. even when the place is packed. Im never going back. dont waste your time."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Middle Eastern cuisine but I regret to say that much of the food at Cleopatra was decidedly bad. The humus and spinach pie appetizers were both tasty but the \"fresh\" grilled tilapia brought on the gag reflex. It was anything but fresh. The kafta kebab also tasted like it had seen one day too many. The sirloin kebab was tender and good and the salmon kebab was just OK. The desserts (baklava, knafe, and baklava fingers) all tasted rancid or at the very least, they were not made with butter but rather a less expensive shortening substitute. The subpar cuisine was matched by loud background radio (with commercials).  Apart from the very pleasant wait staff, the food and soundtrack combined to make this dining experience very unpleasant. As another reviewer said, I hope they can improve because the West Valley needs more decent non-chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Dined here several times and recently ordered take out.   Our favorite items are: Lamb chops, hummus with meat, combo platter. Everything comes with a huge portion of delicious buttery rice, and some of the entrees come with pita and dolmas too. The chicken kabobs and surprisingly moist and flavored well, same w/ the lamb chops (well, usually).   I'm taking stars off for several reasons. Firstly, they have odd hours. We've gone during their regular restaurant hours and found the doors to be locked. They have a hookahs available inside so if you don't like being surrounded by smoke when you eat, definitely do not go during dinner hours. Last time we did takeout we ordered our favorite lamb chops cooked to a medium temp, but sadly when we opened up the box we found 4 tiny, dry pieces of lamb. This dish is about $22 and normally comes with 4 plump lamb chops that is easily shareable. Had we been dining in I would have totally sent it back. Not sure if we would order take out again, maybe dining in is the better option. Prices are a little steep IMO ranging from 14-35  per plate which is high for inconsistent food. Fortunately they usually have groupons or Yelp coupons running, I would totally take advantage of that. Service is hit or miss, regardless of how busy or slow they are. Maybe we will try again in a few months."}
{"text":"We went here for our date night.  It was amazing....The waitress was wonderful...She knew the menu and was able to answer all our questions.  I had the grilled tilapia...It was cooked to perfection...The rice and grilled veg's were spot on also.  My husband had the steak kebab.  He said the steak was jucy and full of flavor.  The service was excellent.  Never had to ask for anything.  We will be back...Many times...Great experience...."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. This food is outstanding, loaded with flavour, and it was delivered very quickly."}
{"text":"This place although completely unassuming from the outside and almost hidden from the main drag,Bell Rd.. It surprised me once inside!  Great food, cocktails & service!  I only give it the 3 stars for now because the ambiance is lacking a bit. I was there with three others and we basically were the only customers all evening!  Craziness. The place is nicely decorated (bordering on gawdy) but still,. Nice-ish. The owner came by to see how we were doing and to invite us back on a Saturday night, they apparently have belly dancers and dj music for late night dancing. I'll go back for that and re-evaluate my review then. Hope I can give them more stars..   We shall see: TBA! Xo"}
{"text":"My sister wanted to try this restaurant out tonight for her birthday dinner.  Since she loves Mediterranean food, and we've been wanting to try this restaurant, we decided tonight's the night.  Tonight was also the last night.  The service was sub par at best .  It took me asking the waitress three times for a glass of water, mind you the restaurant was not crowded.  When she finally decided to com/e and take out orders or chicken sharawma, lamb kabobs, chicken fingers (for the 7 year old), gyro plate and the Sultani platter, it took an hour for each entree to arrive at the table.. one entree at a time, about 5-10 minutes between each entree.  The guest that ordered the Sultani (grilled fish) did not receive what they ordered, rather they received the filet kabob plate.  Since we couldn't locate our waitress who had gone outside and wasn't checking her table(s)  we advised another waitress about the mixup.  In which we found out they were out of Sultani and made the decision to replace a fish dinner with beef with the reasoning that the filet was better than the Sultani.  tone came out and told us the restaurant was out of fish and ask if we would like something else in its place. When we finally located our waitress to advise her of this, her simple was response was \"yeah I heard\".  When asked what she was going to do to fix it, she got defensive and said well what do you want me to do.  As a patron, I shouldn't have to figure out your solution for you, this is your job, I came here to relax and enjoy a meal that took an hour to come out and when it did it was wrong. When it came time to pay the bill, we were waiting for her to take the payment and she came over and said \"Is there a problem?\".  Needless to say, she did not receive a tip.  The one star is for the food, which was delicious, however the lackluster service ruined the meal and I would not recommend this place unless you have nothing but time and don't mind the staff deciding what you're going to eat for you."}
