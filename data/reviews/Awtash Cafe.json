{"text":"This place is very appealing to the eye and has the potential of being a great cafe.....too bad the horrible horrible service and attitude of the servers just ruins the whole experience.  We decide to try their pomegranate sangria (sounded different and interesting) So basically it was juice, lots of little fruits and lots and lots of ice.  I don't even know if they put any wine in there.  Of course we weren't expecting to get drunk from sangria, but after one full pitcher between 2 girls you think we would feel something, anything.  All we felt was filled with juice.  So second pitcher we decided to go for a regular sangria and we told the girl the first one tasted like juice only and she turns around and sarcastically \"Ya I think that's what a sangria is supposed to be\".  Needless to say the second pitcher was as crap as the first one. We ordered shisha, and our server is nowhere to be found after that......15 minutes later I go up to the bar to get a napkin and the girl says oh your shisha's coming.  10 minutes after finally we see another server, so we ask her about our shisha, she looks at us and goes ok what flavor do you want? (again with a side of attitude)  SERIOUSLY?  so we tell her what we had ordered 20+ minutes ago and she leaves.  Took another 15 minutes to get our shisha.  Honestly I don't even remember if the taste was good or not cause by that point I was pissed.   Basically good luck finding a server.  We ordered some food too...we had their platter.  It was ok, nothing to write home about.  I'm very very big on service so if I go to a place and am willing to give them my business I expect service in return.  So for the reason of the crap service alone I will not be going back there.  Yes the open doors into the street concept is very nice for a summer night, but not worth the attitude that comes with their mediocre food and horrible drinks.   Too bad I HAVE to give at least one star for the review, if I had the option they would get a negative 2. Spend your money somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice. Great music and service. Hooka was not very good. Would go back again ...minus the hooka."}
{"text":"Here's the thing about not apologizing for screwing up massively: You never know if the one of those diners you've disrespected has an iota of real influence, should they, you know, decide to speak to others who actually have influence.   Never before in my life have I experienced what my friend and I experienced at this place last night. First of all, we love shisha, and had both, in fact, been there once before. The service was good that time, as was the food.   Here's last night's account: We walk in and were seated in a booth right in front of the bar. We ordered two drinks not long after that. It takes 17 minutes to get those drinks. Whatever. We weren't in the mood to complain. We were tired and it was Friday. Then, this petite blonde waitress takes our order -- a pizza and an appetizer platter (which is comprised of cold items, and needs merely minutes to prepare).   After one hour and 15 minutes of being completely ignored (and keep in mind we consumed our first round of drinks and were never offered more), I decide to signal someone to ask what the hell was up.   This tall, dark, lanky fellow with scraggly facial hair asks me what I ordered. I tell him. He disappears for five minutes, then comes back to tell me it's in the oven and will be ready in five minutes. Then, he says this (and I quote): \"Don't worry, guys, we'll do a shot after.\" 25 minutes later, our food comes out. When it does, I ask for a discount in a dry, but respectful tone. That same blonde waitress responds with, \"Ill get the manager.\" No one shows up.   Then, a few minutes later, brown Tom Green shows up again and tells me the second pint I had just ordered is on him. We wonder if he's the manager, or rather an excuse for one. I remind him of the requested discount. He says, and I quote, \"No problem!\"  Then, when we get our bill, I decide to rush things and pay at the bar because my friend, who was here visiting me from HAMILTON, had to run back home, as he had to work early the next day. The same dude asks me if I want a shot with a smirk. I give him a look that says, \"Really? Really, man? A shot?\"   I work as an editor for a major Toronto publication and have had plenty of experience reviewing establishments. I hope the owners know that I have already started spreading the word, to other editor and writer friends across the city with real influence.   I sincerely hope this place goes out of business. And soon. Its mere existence is defamation of the restaurant industry."}
{"text":"We called in to make reservations and were told we don't need them. When we arrived there was no room, as everything was reserved. We got a nice corner at the back, but could barely fit in there. The group next to us waited for their food for so long that they actually went out to the nearby shawarma place and got some food. The hookah was blah - though I'm not sure if it's because of the laws prohibiting tobacco. Our server was nice, but seemed frustrated and overwhelmed at times.     Bad experience, beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"The decore and atmosphere is great!  The staff are friendly!   The food is very unique!  But unfortunately the wait time is too long! And the shisha I had wasnt all that good!"}
{"text":"Beer: delirium tremens...higher in alcohol content and pretty tasty"}
{"text":"Very nice place to smoke shisha!!! Ambiance is amazing, food is really good (though service is slow). But who cares how fast you got food if you came to relax and enjoy shisha. The only thing you have to book table in advance, especially if you want to come after 9pm. But the rest is super good!"}
{"text":"Service is damn slow if you order food but the ambience is really nice the lighting is sexy but it can get pretty noisy and crowded when they're busy which is often prices are alright 15 bucks for shisha"}
{"text":"Meh. This place is pretty over priced considering they can't be bothered to maintain the furniture or the washrooms. Have you ever seen one of those Saw movies? Well they could very well have been filmed in those washrooms. The chai tea was actually pretty good but I was disappointed, especially given the price, that they didn't have spiced or saffron sugar cubes. The flavour in the shisha was also underwhelming as it didn't even last through one coal. I won't be back again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Wanted to go out on a Saturday and found this spot. Music is really good, the atmosphere is authentic and the food is great and inexpensive.  I'll definitely be coming back here... :)"}
{"text":"Please do not open a shisha place if you don't know how to make one!!!!   I went here for the second time with my boyfriend and Awtash completely ruined our night...to say the least. We went to Awtash after dinner to relax with some drinks and shisha.   1) Horrible seating! - So the seating looks appealing from afar....bench by the window that open onto the streets of Toronto. Regardless of how many cushions we used, me and my boyfriend were constantly moving the entire night trying to find a comfortable spot. The seat really did not make it easy for us to chill at Awtash  2) Service Sucks! - you know service sucks if you have to get up twice to get the waitress in a small place like Awtash. Our drinks took forever to come....shisha seemed like an ordeal. We kept complaining about the shisha because it wasn't working.....all they did when they did do something was take the shisha in the back, bring it out again and then drop it on the table and walk away! The staff did not even wait for 30seconds to ensure that we were happy with the shisha. I mean....after we complained for the fourth time....you would think that the waiter would stick around for a couple of minutes to make sure that the shisha worked.....but NOT at this place. PS. That is how you lose customers! There were 5-6 people working and the place was completely empty....so I fail to understand what everyone was so busy with that they could not provide good service. We would get shisha...it wouldn't work, and then we would have to wait another 10-15 mins before someone came by.  3) Shisha is not their selling point! - So Awtash really does not know how to make shisha or how one works. Now my boyfriend and I have been smoking shisha for years....and believe me when I say that Awtash does not even know what Shisha is. We complained that the shisha wasn't working and the server went and added more water to it.....filled it to the top. If you have ever smoked shisha before, you KNOW that doesn't fix anything!   We complained again and he just got us a new charcoal....and that helps with the suction HOW????  We complained again and he pulls out a pen to make more holes in the foil covering the cup.....seriously! I almost snapped at this point and told him that it wasn't the holes. His shisha was messed up. He takes it back and then comes back out with the same one, drops it on the table and walks away.   PS......its been 50 minutes in Awtash at this point....the entire pitcher of Sangria is almost done but still no shisha!   So the shisha doesn't work again (no surprise there)....we discover that the issue is with the metal ball that should be there....but has been replaced by a foil ball that does not rotate when you suck....hence, the shisha does not work!!!! It's no rocket science...really. After complaining yet again and telling our server to change the shisha, he brings us a new shisha that has the metal ball. I don't understand why he couldn't do that in the first place?!?! We wasted an hour trying to teach them how to make shisha and fix one if it wasn't working.  All this while, our flavour had been burning with the charcoal on it and was not refreshed by the server. There was BARELY any flavour in the cup to begin with and by the time the guy managed to give us the new shisha, the favour was completely burnt!!! Imagine going through this ordeal on a Saturday night only to then smoke burnt flavour.  There was never any apology from the staff at any point for providing a horrible experience and we left Awtash on the Saturday night feeling crappy. Never again Awtash....you ruined my day that started out perfect and had been only getting better until I stepped into your facility. Please hire servers who know how to make a shisha and just MAYBE you will survive in Toronto."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Only one waitress serving. Ordered a hookah as soon as we walked in. Beers and food ten minutes later. Twenty minutes into service he food is the first thing to come out. No drinks no hookah. Work on your service!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to say that the music has finally been turned down in this place. Awtash is visually stunning, but at the same time, as mentioned in a previous review, depending on your tastes it can be either whimsical or \"douchey\" to walk in and see a very stylized Persian lounge full of velvet and glaring lights.  The waitresses are all very kind, but they come around once in a blue moon, and the place always opens about 15 minutes late. They know the menu top to bottom and can give you recommendations on anything.  The food is delicious, especially the thin crust pizzas and dips, but as someone with a sesame allergy I have to say that pretty much everything I have eaten here besides the sorbet has triggered an allergic reaction. If you're one of my sort, be sure to ask whether anything has tahini or sesame seeds on top, because the flatbreads, the mirza, and all sorts of other things all contain sesame.  Now to be honest I'm from Markham and all of the shisha bars here are in extremely seedy looking places. I have very little experience with shisha. I've been to two places -- this place and a smokey smelling shawarma place on Yonge and Bloor with bummed out couches that has shisha for half the price of this place and is run by a guy who uses something like a can of pomade in his hair. Don't take my word on shisha, but the shisha here is good, you get something like 1-2 extra coals without being charged, there's a nice range of flavours, and because there's so much room here usually you can smoke as long as you like without any pressure to leave.  Still, I wish that there was a bit more variety on the menu (everything available, excluding desserts, is very dry and sort of heavy) and that service might hurry up, given as it's never ever busy when I come... nonetheless, a nice place to go."}
{"text":"I've been to Awtash 3 times.  Mostly because it's the only half-decent shisha place in downtown.    Unfortunately, I've been more and more dissapointed each time I go there.  This last time was probably the last time I'll go here!  I must admit that the decor and vibe of the place is awesome.  I love the lighting and the eclectic music.  They should lose the flat screen t.vs playing music videos though; it takes away from the ambience.    I've only ever had drinks and shisha here, except for the faloodeh once.  While the drinks are decent, it's quite clear that shisha is definitely not their forte.  Staff has no clue about how a hookah works.    I was there on Saturday night, but it was surprisingly empty inside.  We sat at the bench by the window.  Nice view of the street, but that bench is really uncomfortable.  I couldn't get into a comfortable position no matter how many pillows I stuck under my back.    Service at this place leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered a Peach-Rose hookah and pomegranate Sangria.  About 20 minutes later, the Sangria arrived, but hookah took another 10 minutes.    When the hookah arrived, the guy just put it down and left.  Not bothering to wait and see if everything was to satisfaction.  Clearly no one in the back tests the hookahs before giving them to customers, as ours did not work.  The bowl was tilting, the hose was blocked, and there was no suction.  So, we waited and waited but no one came by to check on us.  Finally, I had to get up and go get the designated hookah guy.  He seemed to have no clue about what was wrong.  I opened the flavour bowl and was amazed that they filled it up less than half..I'm talking a thin layer of flavour at the bottom of the bowl!  What a ripoff!   He took the hookah in the back and brought it back saying he had put more water in it and it should be ok now.  Seriously? Water was clearly not the problem! I mean, c'mon, if you're serving hookah, know how it works! So obviously it did not work, then he took it back and changed the hose, didn't work; then I noticed that they had replaced the little metal ball needed to maintain suction with a ball made out of aluminium foil. I pointed it out and he says \"yah, i just fixed that since the ball was missing.\"  Why not just change the hookah for us and try your experiments in the back after?? So after going back and forth 4 times, and having been in the restaurant for almost an hour without having a moment's peace, I had had enough and asked him to just replace the whole thing.    Meanwhile, charcoal was burning on our flavour the whole time but we got the same flavour back.  Halfway through the first coal, the flavour was entirely burnt out.  To make matters worse, they only allow one extra coal and don't give it to you upfront.  So we waited another 10 minutes after the first coal burnt out but no one came to replace the coal.  Again I had to get up and get the waitress.  Frustrating stuff.  Needless to say, it was an aggravating end to what started as a good night elsewhere.    The place definitely has potential - it's very nicely done in terms of decor and ambience and the drinks are good.  They really need to improve the service and quality of hookah though.   Unfortunately, not too many other options in downtown.  Markaz had even worse service, arrogant owner and bad shisha, but that's for another review - that place has closed down for now, to be opened elsewhere.  Downtown's better off!"}
{"text":"Okay, so me and my friends decided to go out on my friends birthday. As we were walking down college street we saw the sign and said hey. Why not? When we got in and were seated we had to wait approximately one hour in order to get our shishas. And we had to wait another ten minutes just to get our drinks. That's 70 minutes for one drink. We were planning on having a fun night out but because of awtash's horrible service our vibes got killed and we did not have fun. I would definitely recommend not coming here it was the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant. We expected much more but we were let down immensely. Once again I do not recommend coming to awtash because of the horrible service and the mediocre pizza."}
{"text":"1) chef quit on the day I went so there was no food 2) shisha was good  3) it was a bit expensive"}
{"text":"One of my usual places for late night hand outs. It has a very interesting decor and authentic ambiance, not to mention one of my top choices for shisha (hooka) and hanging out with friends. It is definitely a great date place too.  Good: decor, food, and drinks.  Bad: not much, personal preferences might vary."}
{"text":"Great date spot. It's dimly lit and has a wide array of seating from booths, to a bunch of couches around a table, to a two person seater. The shisha is standard and the pipes are kind of falling apart. The service is slow but it's a slow-paced kind of place to kill a few hours shrouded in smoke..."}
{"text":"Great vibe, great owner - a nice little Persian cafe without having to truck on up to the hinterlands - I am a fan.    OK, I love this place. A lot. But I feel sort of compelled to ask... WHY THE H#$%! AREN'T YOU OPEN BEFORE 5PM??????   I know, I know - No dark & sexy before 5pm - BUT - since they already have everything in place to just open the doors early and simply BE one of the best coffee places on College St - Why don't they? Ok, I confess that my ulterior motive is to turn this place into my virtual office - someplace where I can be comforted by the environment and further comforted by the discomfort it would cause to the droids that, quite frankly, make me really uncomfortable.  What was this review about again?  Oh yeah Awtash! I love that place!"}
{"text":"Visited Awtash last Wednesday night and was really disappointed. They were clearly understaffed for the evening. It took for ever for someone to take our order for the shisha. Then it arrived almost 20 mins later with no tips. Drinks arrived late and the coke was flat.  Very slow service and nobody apologised for a bad evening. I had been to Awtash about 10 months ago and everything was great. I guess this was just a bad night for us :-( Cannot recommend to anyone now."}
{"text":"***4.5 Stars ***  I planned my SO's birthday surprise here this past weekend.  We all had a blast.  Awtash Cafe has online reservations for big groups.  We were able to get a cozy corner booth.  I love the vibe at this place, so laidback and there is awesome lounge/techno music playing in the background.  We had tried their 5 dip platter, which was delicious.  It came with all the middle eastern dip fare, hummus, baba ganosh (sp?), marinated olives and some warm persian flat bread.  Their drinks were reasonably priced, a pitcher of Sangaria for $16!  We even did a round of shots at $6 each.  The main draw to Awtash was the Hookah bar!  You can get two flavours for $15, it comes with 2 coals.  I did not realize how relaxing Hookah was, it was a great pairing with our drinks.  The service did match the vibe at this place.  It was very chilled out and they would periodically check in with you if you need anything.  Do not expect rush and prompt service if that is what you are looking for.  I will definitely be back for future loungey nights out."}
{"text":"They have  decent variety of shisha and beer; it's reasonable priced. It's a nice atmosphere, and the seating is comfortable and relaxing. The service is just okay. However, the washroom smells like a sewer, and looks like one too. They're making fairly good money here since the shisha isn't the cheapest and it's in a prime location, so the least they could do is maintain the washroom."}
{"text":"Sheesha bar sympa au coin de College et Bathurst. Grandes tables : idéal pour les groupes.   // Sheesha bar at College and Bathurst. The good stuff here are the huge tables for the groups."}
{"text":"Awtash Cafe opened just a few days ago and I am so delighted! It's close enough, and good enough, to become a regular lunch hour destination for me.   I have a decent imagination but I cannot comprehend how Awtash Cafe used to be that somewhat dive-y Tea House 168. The interior and exterior are completely different. Dark wood furnishings, cushioned couch banks, heaps of pillows, dramatic light fixtures, Persian print posters: it is all such a remarkable upgrade from the former shabby, scuffed-up bubble tea cafe.  The drinks menu includes coffee shop staples like cappuccinos, lattes and teas as well fruit shakes, lemonade and special Persian-fusion creations. There are several different chai, rosewater and saffron beverages on the menu, which I'd say are quite unusual.  For lunch today, a friend and I each tried a specialty pizza and a shake. I had a coconut shake which was rich and tasted of actual, real, fresh coconut. My friend tried the saffron shake, which came in a dish with sliced fruit on top. The saffron shake also had a delicate essence of rosewater. My dining buddy declared she wanted to order a second one immediately. I think this is going to be her new \"I'm having a rough day\" treat.  For meals, the menu lists sandwiches, hummus platters, salads and two genres of pizza (standard combinations and Persian specialities). The pizzas are $8.50 for a dinner plate size (I took half home for later). I tried the Fessnjoon pizza with chicken, pineapple, pomegranate-walnut sauce and a sesame crust. It was an unusual combo but a very good one. I recommend it. Some of my other co-workers tried the sandwiches earlier this week ($6.50 each) and declared them to be extremely good, too. There is a dessert menu: cakes by the slice and ice cream too, I think.  Awtash has applied for a liquor license, and I can definitely see myself reclining on those piles of pillows enjoying an after work drink - perhaps a saffron martini or similar? And did I mention this place is also a shisha/hookah bar? AND there's wifi, a big TV projection screen and also a separate lounge room at the back, perfect for a group event. It's all here! And as an added bonus, the staff is super friendly, too.  *note - they are still new so they don't take debit or credit cards yet*"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited about one hour for drinks, pizza, and shisha. The shisha was horrible, it only came with one coal, and when we asked for another they looked at us like we were requesting the world."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come in here A LOT after work later in the evening, so that we can talk in a relaxed environment around a table. The atmosphere is chill, and the hooka is a bonus - we have always gotten the melon flavor. We tend to spend a lot of money and get a lot of drinks all at once (the mixed cocktails are delicious) so that we can make last call - even though we normally arrive between 12 to 1am and one would assume have plenty of time?   The only negative is that we are always rushed and often left ignored and without service closer to 1:30-2am. We always leave a great tip because we are all service industry folks, so what's the deal guys? You are open until 2am on Fridays and Saturdays, and we know we are allowed to sit with our drinks for a bit after by law, there are still lots of other tables. Relax, do your clean up while you are waiting for tables to finish, and follow through with good service the whole way through!"}
{"text":"Just don't get the sangria.  It was the worst, least-sangria tasting sangria I have ever had. Granted it was the pomegranate-sangria, but still, it should still have some semblance of sangria but didn't.   We went late at night because it was the only place that would let us in without IDing us (we are of age, but one friend forgot his ID) and that didn't charge cover (which it shouldn't).   The shisha is average priced at $15 per hookah, there's a lot of flavours, we had apple. It was pretty good. We sat in the very back, and it was quite cute.  It's not awesome, definitely not the best shisha bar I've ever been to, but it was a nice time, nice place, solid experience that was downtown and there when we needed it."}
{"text":"Nice joint with a nice staff but no tobacco in the shisha. Soooo no buzz. I don't see the point. If you're here for other reasons then maybe its worth checking out."}
{"text":"Found this place on a Friday night when looking for a somewhere to have a coffee.   Upon entering  Awtash I was struck by the smell of sheesha...delicious, sickly, sweet!   Lovely big booths, warm atmosphere and I experienced good service.   We ordered strawberry sheesha ($15) ,coffees and desserts.The menu has a few different desserts including vegan options. I opted for the rose waffles and pistachio ice cream. The ice cream was fantastic, however the waffle was more like a wafer. Coffee was perfect! My friend had the chocolate/strawberry flat bread which was delicious.  Our server stopped by enough but it was not overly busy; that said there was a party in the place.  Overall it was a positive experience."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is Dark & Sexy which made me stood out from the crowd as I'm neither Dark or Sexy. I'm the guy that is pissed because I got teased by fake Hookah that doesn't have Tobacco. It's like a Nicotine Patch or those Fake Cigarettes. Obviously laws restrict having indoor Sheesha but it's a nice way to get someone back on the wagon.   It was a good experience overall and now I understand why my Friend commented some Persians have full-scale bellies. Eat an enormous meal and then lay down and smoke it up while enjoying sugary Teas. Now that's the lifestyle we should adopt and love. I want to take a before-and-after photo of me and my Persian friend now. :D   Gol o' Bolbol(Saffron Ice Cream w/Rosewater Faloodeh $6.00), Koma Chai Chai(Persian Tea $4.50) and Hookah were all very complementary to this relaxing environment after our dinner from across the street.   However I guess I missed out on how to rest properly because that WOODEN back of the benches was uncomfortable to most of my body parts even 5 cushions didn't work and I don't have enough body fat yet to cushion myself. The Hookah extensions kept knocking over someone's glassware on the table.  Now it makes me want to smoke in lying down on the seats while watching a sports game and snooze away.  It was almost to that level of comfort and enjoyment.  The only staff there was amazingly friendly gentleman that did everything for us.  Thanks Bijan for sharing this with us."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday in a group of 5 after I heard that Markaz closed down.  We parked around the corner on the street and walked by here.  I almost went into sneaky dee's instead because I'm almost an alcoholic, but I made it there anyways (sober)  We walked in, and it was alot bigger than I expected. The decor was really nice.  There was no one working near the door though, so kinda wandered aimlessly into the back, and around the bar area...and finally a server seated us.  The seating was awesome. HUGE TABLE. Sexy booth loungish-ness.   We looked throught the menu, and didn't want to eat anything really. (I WAS DYING FOR A SHAWARMA AND I HOPED THEY HAD FOOD. But they didn't really have anything..substantial to eat on the menu. I guess that's not what they're there for)  My friends and I ending up getting  1. The Faloodeh Shirazi - Persian Faloodeh (vermicelli) frozen with rose syrup and lemon. Nice, but lacking a certain umph that you get from the authentic stuff. But its the first time I've seen it in Canada, so double thumbs up!  2. The Faloodeh Anari - The same as abouve, except with dark pomegranate syrup. See above for review as well.  3. The Nutty Bear - My friend ordered this, and it was ...interesting. I didn't actually try it though, but it was like a nutella and raspberry sandwich.   4. The Latte - Standard, nothing special.  5. The Chai Naneh - a little more mint leaves in this would've been nice, but it was still pretty good. :)  6. Shisha - Double Appz and Mint - Okay, first thing I have to say...no tobacco shisha is pointless. Anyways, for pointless Shisha, it was still pretty good. I had to work my shisha adjustment magic, but it last pretty long. We there for about 2 hours.    Another great point - They have playing cards! We spent the whole time playing crazy 8 countdown, and no one made it past 6 before we realized how long we were playing for..    Atwash (persian for Fire) was great. I can definitely see this becoming a hangout spot for us :)"}
{"text":"One of the coolest places to hang out at in Toronto (okay fine maybe I'm just overexcited about a Persian cafe opening up downtown!) but I've really enjoyed coming to this place.  It's a perfectly laid out huge area for a cafe (perfect for Parties, especially in the back room), that serves persian desserts, shisha / hookah , and some unique Persian / Italian fusion food (Ghormeh Sabzi Pizza anyone?). I wouldn't necessarily come here for a dinner but it's a great place to hang out and grab a snack and dessert.  It's very rare to see such unique places in Toronto and for them to do such a great job at it too but I think Awtash has hit the spot. Completely elegant decor, but not too expensive. Really intimate but again tons of space. Great tasting offerings, no pretentiousness!   What more could you ask for? Well I just wish it was a bit busier and lively but I'm sure that will come in time!"}
{"text":"The decor of this place was very mis-matched and offset but some how it kinda worked pretty well. The lighting up in this place is terrible. The front of the place is perfect but the back room was just way too dark. I know they were trying to go for a really chillax environment but a little more lighting would definitely help. It was just way too dim-lit, and my eyes started to hurt after a bit and all of my friends looked like black blobs.  I didn't really try any of their food yet but we ordered their hummus and it was pretty good. Decent and it hit the spot. Nothing can wrong with hummus and pita bread sticks!  Their drink menu was extensive and the beers were really affordable.  It was my first time at a shisha place so I can't really judge the shisa quality and taste but it was definitely a new experience for me. I came here for a friend's birthday and we ended up having a really great time, it was cramped but that's because we had a lot of people!  They seemed to have a standard selection of shisha flavours but the ones that we ended up getting was rose & peach and the double apple. The flavours were subtle but the double apple did not taste like apple at all. One of my friends thought it tasted like black liquorice and I did agree with him. My other friend thought it tasted like the smell of a Chinese medicine store, haha.  Overall, pretty laid back atmosphere and it's a place where you can just get food, have a drink, smoke shisha and relax."}
{"text":"Good things-  Ambiance Desserts  Never too busy  Bad things-  Really bad service- one waiter told us they are very understaffed right now and they closed the day before because there was no one available to work  Average price  I will return."}
{"text":"We were in a desperate search for a hookah joint and stumbled upon Awtash.  To be honest, I was about to abort the plan - with the loud lounge music and the decor... the place looked kinda douchey.  But we pushed in and after asking to not be seated by the speakers, we were seated in the semi-private back room.  First off, once you're away from the loud DJ - this place is pretty nice.  It's a laid back Middle Eastern vibe with lots of big tables and couches and pillows.  The shisha we had was tasty and the staff was on the ball about replacing our charcoal.  The waitresses came by frequently to ask if we needed anything else.  All around, the staff was dope.  And we were there on a Friday night and they had $4 tall cans of MGD Light.  I know - I know - it's crap beer.  But for $4 - I'll drink it.  Not bad at all, will be back."}
{"text":"After enjoying a sumptuous meal at Sheherzade, our group crossed the street to Awtash Café for a nightcap.   Imitating the decadence of a pasha's court, the café is gorgeously decorated with plush banquet sofas and ornate glass lamps to set an intimate mood. The café is a large open space with chairs and sofas, private booths across from the bar and a decent sized private room in the back.   Our group settled in the private room, lounged on the cushioned banquet seating, and \"smoked\" our shisha pipes.  At Awtash, you can enjoy chai tea, eat specialty pizzas and Persian desserts, the latter of which I tried. As if my delicious meal of beef, chicken and lamb wasn't filling enough, I ordered a Faloodeh Anari for dessert. It's a Persian sorbet made of thin vermicelli noodles with lime and pomegranate juice. I won't lie, it's odd chewing on sorbet. But the fresh juices had softened the noodles and it made for one of the more unique dessert experiences I've ever had.   I would be inclined to return here again. Awtash offers great treats with a cozy and relaxed atmosphere that would make my visit an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"As others have said this place a very sexy vibe! Very well thought out seating and decor. Love the Persian influence throughout. The den in the back is a great setup for small parties and the booths will comfortably sit 8 at the big booths, 4 at the smaller booths. This is along with comfy couches, beautiful art, and unique light fixtures. I felt like I was in a Persian Hookah bar!  Server was very friendly, beautiful, and attentive; other than roughly 10 minute wait when we arrived. I believe she was in the back fixing up some food or beverages. After that she was great and knowledgeable regarding the food/Shisha. Try the Strawberry/Banana combo :)   Food and drink selection are decent for a Hookah bar. We chose the red Sangria which was clearly made with very fresh ingredients (apples, raspberries, blueberries, and citrus) and decent wine.  We ordered the spinach dip and basic olives. The spinach dip, although not unique, was very tasty paired with flatbread. The olives were nothing special, seemed to just be standard green olives.  I haven't been to other Hookah bars but $15 seemed a little expensive for only one flavor. She did keep it maintained and offered coal when needed.  I will return to try some of their sandwiches and cocktails!  PS: $4 PBR cans (Pabst) are worth mentioning.  ."}
{"text":"This is a brand-spankin' new shisha place near my place. I'm no shisha head, but i'll have it from time to time. This is the best shisha place i've been to overall in Toronto for both atmosphere and quality. They also have some really interesting food there.  I ordered some dessert that was a kind of sorbet in rose water with vermicelli noodles in it. It sounds disgusting I know, but it was really good!   Also, their shisha pipes are pretty frickin' cool looking (though I think they need some breaking in -- i got a bit of a plastic-y taste every now and then)  Owner is pretty friendly too.. I would go back.."}
{"text":"Great place for hookah! We arrived around 11:15 one evening and the waitress very sweetly welcomed us and reminded us that they close at 12 (it wasn't rude at all, she was just keeping us informed). We ordered a hookah to split and found a comfy place to sit. This cafe has several different kinds of areas and I'm sure that a group can find a comfortable place to chill out while eating or enjoying hookah.  We didn't eat but we did have a relaxing 45 minutes and were well attended by the bubbly waitress.  My only complaint is that the cost was higher than I am used to, about $15. But it's a nice place and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Out of all the sheesha bars in Toronto, Awtash is a nice little place.  The positives: 1) The place is big  2) The tables- booths are a great size 3) They have a private seperate seating area in the back 4) They have great drinks and not as expensive as Paeez 5) The small menu they have is good 6) They don't charge you for extra coal   The cons: 1) Service is terrible 2) Mid price range for sheesha   If you are a regular sheesha smoker, this might not be a regular spot for you. But it's a good place to bring a unisex crowd and feel safe (compared to some of the other joints with cheaper sheesha is shady areas). It's great to go before a fun night out on college, a meet up place so to say."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and set up.  The front windows are wide so it's perfect for summer shisha smoking.  I didn't get the chance to try any of their food or drinks though.  Shisha was good, very good flavour and the hookah looked clean, they only brought it with 1 coal which i thought was odd, but they gave us another when we asked.  Got 2 bottles of water, only 1 of them was cold but they offered us a glass with ice so i guess that's ok.  Service was ok, kind of slow. About ~$15 for shisha."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I thought \" this place is sexy,\" I wanted to love it so badly! Unfortunately the service was a bit disappointing. Let's start off with the good   Pros: Sexy atmosphere  Extremely friendly servers  Unique menu (didn't try anything)  Comfy couch Delicious shisha   Cons: Dark sketchy path to the bathrooms  The people who came after me were served before me  Had to flag down a server Took way too long to get some shisha   Aside from that this is a good place to come hang with friends, have some shisha, a snack and play cards. I will be back"}
{"text":"Update! I told you I would return for the food. I finally got the chance.  The food menu is small - basically there is a selection of 5 dips (hummus, etc), a couple salads, a pizza menu and a sandwich menu. Also note that the prices have increased since June (more expensive than quoted in Andrea's review, but everything is priced reasonably)  The pizza is divided into two types - traditional (Italian) selections (all $10), or persian-\"fusion\" ones ($12).  We tried 2 of the pizzas with very mixed results. The pizzas are extremely thin crusted (yay!) and are made with persian flatbread (kind of crunchy with sesame seeds)  Fesenjoon (Chicken breast in walnut and pomegranate stew topped with pineapple) - This one was REALLY good. Slightly sweet from the pomegranate.   Ghormeh Sabzi (Beef & red beans in a mixed herb stew) - This was F*CKING AWFUL. Please do not order it. Really seriously disappointing. It looked pretty but tasted very bland. It had way too many herbs on it, lots of parsley sort of slathered on and looked liked cooked spinach.   The service was really slow. Server was extremely friendly but we had to flag him down a zillion times even though the cafe was close to empty. The pizzas took a long time to come out.  As beautiful as this place is, I just cannot give it the 5 star upgrade. (-0.5 stars for make-me-puke pizza, -0.5 stars for slow service)"}
{"text":"Awtash Cafe really so different from the places I usually frequent!   Yes I love this sexy vibes of this place. And when it is dark, everyone looks 100% more sexy and good looking... (BTW, sucks if you want to take good photos!)   Just love those loungers... Really want to take off my shoes and just laid there.. (I really did take off my shoes!)   Nahna Muddled Mint Tea/Saffron Ice Cream with Faloodeh  - Tea has been sweetened with syrup already so no other sweetener is necessary for me to enhanced the taste  - My first experience with Faloodeh... A-OK... I might have to try some more in the future (My friend ate most of it...)  Sheesha (Blueberry/Double Apple)  - Hey I think they are playing a practical joke on me or something.. I was given a default hookah and doesn't matter how hard I suck.. until my face was red..nothing happened! At first I thought my lungs were defective!  - I find smoking sheesha a relaxing and social experience.. inhale 1-2-3-4, and exhale and look at the smoke coming out......  - Blueberry tasted much better than Double Apple.... and some other people wants to steal mine because they like my flavour more!   Now if I can wear some relax clothings and laid on the coach... hmmmm that will be some really smoking, sexy experience! :P CHILL!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night. It wasn't open, even though it was supposed to be. What a buzzkill."}
{"text":"WHAT THE HELL was that 'special pizza' and WHY THE HELL was it so exquisite, I don't know. I just know I gotta go back there SOON for more.  Recommendation: half Fesenjoon half Ghorme Sabzi pizza.  Very chill place, good for relaxing and socializing. And the food, It's definitely a NEW taste, a delicious one.  Try to get the house Specialty food and dessert instead of regulars, so you know what I mean by \"new taste\"."}
{"text":"Meh, I have had better. This place could be so much better with a little effort on the part of the owners and wait staff.  PROS: * lots of seating- very \"group\" oriented * we have come a few times week night / weekends and never had to wait for seating. * good drink selection- average prices for the area. *public parking is very close by * staff are friendly ( the cook came out at the end of the night and chatted with us a while. He even did a few card tricks to keep us entertained) *TVs playing the news in the background (also a CON because it is distracting)  CONS: * the service is VERY SLOW * the quality of the shisha is poor. It lacks real flavour and is lesser quality to other places in the city. The  staff might need more training on how to set up the \"shisha\" properly.  * The music was WAY too loud- we had to ask the server to turn it down several times so we could hear the other people in our group ( even yelling at each other across the table was impossible to hear). * The mix of customers. On a recent visit there was a very large group of \"Jamaican\"/ \"Trinidadians\" who cranked up their music ( they took over the sound system some how) and started winding and grinding in the middle of the lounge. This was not the right music or atmosphere of a \"chill\" Shisha Lounge. I felt like we were sitting in the middle of a Carabana parade.   If you are looking to impress your friends with a Shisha experience- DONT come here. Try places like TEAVASEE or SHEESHA LOUNGE instead."}
